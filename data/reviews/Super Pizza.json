{"text":"Only thing we ordered was the delivery special pizza.  The delivery was fast and the delivery guy was nice.  The pizza which we just got with extra cheese was really good.   Wish we would have tried the cheese steak sub but we will do that next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Food amazing service amazing ! Environment great what more can you ask for plus the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"The cheese steak stromboli is absolutely amazing....the pizza....perfect....then there's the pancake fries (?) don't try them.....you will be hooked. This is a great local family owned fantastic pizza place!!"}
{"text":"I called to order delivery during lunch time.  Because of the great reviews, I decided to try the cheese steak......and got a side of fried mushrooms.

I was told it would take 30 minutes to deliver.  I pre-paid for everything and included a $5 tip on a $15 order.   After 45 minutes passed, I called to see where my order was.  She was suprised it hadn't arrived yet and even said how slow they were today.

About 5 minutes later it showed up.  Don't know why people rave about the cheesesteak because I thought it was pretty average.  And the fried mushrooms were almost cold because they were so late."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ordered double sausage pizza I guess I slice gets double .also ordered the fried mushroom 6 small button ones do they even check the basket? Wings had no sauce please not a single drum stick what a shame I really liked this place .But I will not be going back to many other choices."}
{"text":"First time eating here and maybe it was a bad night but I definitely won't be going back. Ordered a pepperoni pizza and garlic knots. Should be pretty standard at a pizza joint, right? Wrong. The garlic knots were burnt, as well as chewy. And upon opening the box- we apparently just wanted to pay for the pepperoni, but actually eat cheese pizza which was also extremely chewy. Cheese like rubber. Maybe I should have ordered the cheesesteak... But I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Yet another pizza place with blinders on.  Inquired if they had vegan cheese.  A very emphatic NO and a facial grimace that said it all.  

Guess what guys?  You just lost a potential customer who will continue to patronize Pizza Company and Sammy's because those places know that vegan money is green, just like everyone elses."}
{"text":"just like home - best in town.     tried them all and this is just like east coast pizza.   love, love, love it."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good but it was a little cold. Probably due to the hour I waited for it. Not bad. Not great."}
{"text":"Hate to do this but - Most awful slice of pizza ever. You win!

My almost 5 year old thought the super heros looked great and wanted to get a slice. Our slices were old as dirt, yellow cheese and even though it was hot it was in one solid piece because it was so damn old. On top of that.the middle of the dough was still moist and reheated.

It was so bad - I don't even know how they have decent ratings here."}
{"text":"I've never gone here before, but they apparently have new management as of 4/22/16. Everyone working there was friendly and one of the owners was particularly personable. The kitchen is ran by an actual cook, not some teenager lacking sanitation sensibility. I think he's from the East Coast and originally from Europe (not sure if it's Italy, Sicily or somewhere else).

The food itself was very good. They had a carryout special 16\" 2-Topping for $9.95. I got two of those, a Super Cheesesteak hoagie and a cannoli. The pizza dough is flavorful with a good consistency and all the toppings were fresh. It did not taste greasy at all despite the pepperoni and sausage. I was also impressed with the Cheesesteak. It tasted just as good as a Capriotti's sub. I'll definitely go back there for another sub, if not another pizza. As for the cannoli, the pastry part had a good crumble to it and the filling was near perfect - sweet, but not overpowering. There's always a lot of options for pizza, Super Pizza is worth trying out. 

It doesn't lose a star for anything, I just need to go back to try other items on their menu like chicken wings and fingers. If that checks out, it might be my go-to carryout place for Monday Night Football.

Sidenote: The dining area is clean but its nothing fancy or special. They don't serve beer or wine so it's not ideal for dining in."}
{"text":"Super Pizza is a great mom and pop pizza shop! The people are super nice, very welcoming and the pizza is delicious! Pizza is slightly greasy but what pizza isn't! Great go-to pizza joint if your not down with the cookie cutter pizza shops! Say no to Pizza Hut and yes to Super Pizza."}
{"text":"It pains me to give super pizza the rating I gave it, but I feel like I have no choice.  I really wanted to like this place, for me it's close to my school and it had good rating on yelp, however this is not going to be a glowing review.  I came here with some friends from school with a hankering for pizza, and I wanted to find a \"go to\" spot that I could count on to kill my frequent pizza cravings.  Upon entering I noticed a Philadelphia eagles jersey hanging and asked, \"hey are you guys from Philly?\"  They were, and I took this as a good sign as Philly has great pizza.  I immediately put in an order for the special, two slices with a drink; I found a seat with my classmates and awaited my meal.  Here is where the wheels came off this wagon.   I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Now keep in mind I came in before any sort of rush, yet my pizza never came.  I watched as everyone in my party got their food, I even saw other customers come in and get their food, and still I waited.  When I went up to inquire about my pizza they said, \"yup you got the two slices\" acknowledging that I had placed an order even before I had spoken to ask where my pizza was.  Then they said, \"we're making a new one\", again all before I even asked.   Now I completely understand that when you're making fresh food sometimes you run out and have to make more, this doesn't bother me.  When you don't do anything to let the customer know that you're running behind, or really care that somebody is on a lunch break and doesn't have two hours to get food, this kind of makes me upset. 
 Beyond that I though the way they spoke to me was dismissive, and I feel like they didn't care to make things right in any shape or fashion.  I mean they even charge 50 cents for soda refills, can you at least offer one of those or just say I'm sorry?  I don't really care for freebies, or try to milk the system so I would have declined, but it's the act of offering that shows you care and are trying to save a bad customer experience.  I ended up going to the counter one more time to ask them to wrap up the pizza to go which they did (but gave me a look that signaled they were not pleased with me).  I threw the box in my car, and went to my class late.   I don't think I'll be going there again and it really sucks, because to be fair, the food was good (my friends let me nibble off of their food so I found out).  I wanted to bump up their rating on that alone, but let's face it customer service means a lot, and sadly it's lacking from this establishment."}
{"text":"This place sounds good, looks good, and it is good. I will be back and I'm bringing friends! I got the Veggie Calzone, Wings, Cannoli, and Zeppoli. Very nice staff. Ask for Shay he is nice."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've been trying different pizza places in the Henderson area for the past year. Not only were the ingredients all fresh and hand cut/ prepared, but the customer service and friendliness was unparalleled. New favorite spot for a great pizza! They asked if it was my first time ordering from them, and when I said yes they proceeded to tell me about how they prepare the pizzas, which ingredients used, and a quick overview of their establishment. I've never even heard of that happening anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and get this pizza!"}
{"text":"First time at Super Pizza.  Was very impressed with the service and the pizza was great!  They gave us free garlic bites (which were very good) and a dessert. It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't consider it good pizza. As a former Chicagoan, it is difficult to find a good pizza anywhere but home. I understand it is supposed to be New York style but the term is so dilluted that it means nothing anymore.

I will give them another shot. 

Garlic knots were doughy and needed more cheese and garlic. Pizza crust was crunchy on the edge and super soggy in middle. Also pepperoni didn't seem cooked enough, althpugh not a health risk, as a pepperoni lover I lile mine crisp on the edges."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass.  The food is  super tasty, the prices are relatively cheap, and the delivery is FREE.  That's right, $FREE.99, and usually quick as hell.  Super pizza is my go to option when I want tasty ass food, but don't want to leave the house."}
{"text":"The last two times I ordered from SP they messed up 50% of the orders. The first time they gave me wings with no sauce.. And the second time my pepperoni pizza shed itself of pepperoni. Thumbs down. (Good food, just not what I ordered)"}
{"text":"Tried Super Pizza today because of the recommendation of a great friend.  We loved it.  Friendly service & yummy pizza.  I especially liked the crust. After dinner, we tried the funnel cake fries! Strips of funnel cake with a little powdered sugar on top.  Yummy!  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I really like Super Pizza! Great pizza, and fast delivery. I'm more than pleased. I'll have to try more than pizza to give it a solid 5, but I haven't been able to get myself to order anything different. My fault!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here quite a few times and have never had a problem. The food was good and the owners were very nice. However tonight I ordered 3 sandwiches, and mine had a soggy black mark on the roll. My husband called and was told it's a burn mark from the oven and all the rolls have them, funny since the other 2 sandwiches didn't have this. It was definitely not a burn mark! My husband explained that I was grossed out by this and wouldn't eat the sandwich. They would do nothing to try to satisfy us. Unfortunately they just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"A family owned business, everything is made to order. Great pizzas, sandwiches, wings, fingers, appetizers, a kids menu, calzones, strombolis, anytime specials and Lunch specials.

{"text":"Awesome idea to use superhero style! ordered large pizza from them last week, which was delivered superfast and tasted pretty good. I would recommend this store to all my friends!"}
{"text":"The husband and I were looking for a good place to get our cheat day carb fest on when we happened upon a place called Super Pizza. We were able to park quickly and when we walked in a very friendly lady took our order. We ordered some hot wings and  their Super Pizza. We sat down and enjoyed some conversation and the football game on the television. About 10 minutes later the lady who took our order brought out a basket of hot wings and said they threw in a couple extra because there were some small ones in the mix. As far as we could tell, there weren't ANY smalls one in the mix. She also brough out ample sides of ranch and bleu cheese that obviously did not come out of a big jug of random brand salad dressing. These dressings were fresh and tasted as if they were made in house. As we greedily munched away a few minutes later our pizza came out. Now I can tell you as a carb starved big girl, the crust was very important to me...and they nailed it! Perfectly crispy on the bottom and light and fluffy in the center. The toppings were abundant and the cheese was real and fantastic. 
As hard as we tried to demolish this beast we could only barely gobble down half of the pizza. The rest was neatly boxed up by the nice lady who took care of us the whole way. We complimented the food and she was humble and flattered and invited us to come back whenever we are on that side of town. It's a small mom and pop place with the whole family working on a Sunday. It's nice to see a locally owned business putting out a good product and backing it up with excellent customer service. 
We will definitely come back and visit as we hear they have a killer cheesesteak and not only that...they have fried pickles. If we weren't in such a food coma we would have tried those too! Great food, great service. Win/win!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad attitude, food is good but, highly over rated................. would not recommend this place. Go to metro pizza, or enzo's pizza instead.............."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good pizza place, and I found that in Super Pizza. I actually had it delivered, and the woman on the phone was very friendly and helpful. It didn't take long for them to arrive. The pizza was pretty good and was huge, bigger than what I expected. The great thing was that it was packed with toppings that were good. The only thing I would change would be the tomato sauce. There was maybe too much that made the bottom a bit soft. But that's something you can always request and not a complaint about them since I'm just not a huge tomato fan. I'm looking forward to having another pizza from there and probably will order one for work."}
{"text":"I have ordered through Grubhub and never disappointed..the meatball parm is out of this world!  Pizza is great and Philly cheesesteak. Yummm... I'm going to start ordering directly.  Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic!! The sauce and cheese were great. The customer service was great! The employee was on a smoke break when I pulled up and she stopped right away and took my order. I would have given 5 stars but the crust was a bit hard & the pizza was a little too greasy, nothing a napkin can't fix though!"}
{"text":"I ordered through the Eat24 app. So I waited patiently for my Boozey Burger and fries. I updated the app and it said delivery time 4:08 PM. It was about 4:40 PM when my food arrived. I called before I got the order and the woman on the phone said it had left seven or eight minutes ago and would be HOT. I got the food and it was luke warm. Please don't lie about when food goes out. Particularly when the app says its suppose to be delivered at 4:08 PM and it's 4:40 PM. Is it any wonder the food was luke warm? The burger also said it came with cheese, it had NO cheese on it.  It also had no mayo on the burger and I am so glad I asked for mayo packets or it would have been dry. I was hungry and so I ate my food because I didn't want to call and tell them to take it back because who knows when I'd get my order plus I was on my lunch break at work and I can't wait forever on replacement food.

What a dissapointment!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their pizza is so good and their drivers are very nice. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for great tasting pizza and great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Finally \"fresh cut\" fries!! Tasty and cooked just right. Large menu so much to chose from. I love the deluxe hoagie section.. different. 

The steak hoagie is exactly how it should be.. its wonderful and fresh!! 

Bravo"}
{"text":"I'm just reviewing the Cheesesteak.  It's good, but it's like they read an online book on how to properly do a Philly Steak. Yes, they do use Whiz, and that is giant... but ordering the steak, with Whiz, and watching them microwave it and spoon it on the steak in a manner in which it became a soggy inedible mess was ridiculous.  I writing this in the hopes that they read this, and understand that one adds all the cheeses to the meat on the grill as a last step.  The cheese is not a topping or an afterthought.  It's a part of the steak."}
{"text":"This review is for the cheesesteak only.
The location itself is kind of hard to find. Look for the gas station and towards the back.
My classmates and I came here during lunch and there was no wait. We all opted for the half cheesesteak + fries lunch combo for around $5. It took them awhile to serve us but it was well worth the wait. Good thing I picked 1/2 since it was the size of my arm! (maybe subway can learn a thing or two). I honestly couldn't finish the whole thing off. Delicious steak covered in melted cheese and sautéed onions and mushroom = delicious! Couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"Sorry to have to do this ... But come on...
I ordered the food and waited an hour and a half for it to arrive.. It still didn't .... I called on a Monday when it's not even busy.. Food was cold to the touch so I can't even evaluate the flavor"}
{"text":"The pizza was great! Also ordered funnel fries which were amazing. The prices were low which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Ordered through eat24, delivery took about an hour,  however pizza was hot when received, the mozzarella sticks on the other were not. The pizza was great, nice abound of cheese, not too thick of a crust.  The ranch was great!!! Got a canoli to try and it was good, not great. 
The marinara sauce has a bit of spice that I was not expecting so it was a nice surprise. I would order from them again, but maybe pick up next time"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about this place is that, in the end, I got my full refund. 
When I called to put my order in, the lady (Tracy, I believe) seemed irritated. After I had hung up, I called back to let her know I would like to pay with a card and not cash, which seemed to irritate her more. After I hung up, my cousin pointed out that I did not give a gate code. I assumed maybe they would call when they were at the gate.
I didn't receive a call but the pizza got to my front door anyway. Cool! Paid and tipped the guy. We start getting into our food and realize that they sent hot wings instead of bbq wings. I called to let them know of the mixup, and Tracy right away said they would send out the right order. 
Meanwhile, we're digging into our pizza. And the toppings are the only good part about it. The sauce tastes bland and the crust tastes like cardboard. It took me a while before I realized that no one ever brought us our correct order of bbq wings. 
So, I give Tracy a call. She said that she called me and left a voicemail saying no one else complained about their wings so I had to have gotten the correct order. I told her my phone hasn't gotten any calls or voicemails. Then I'm listening to her tell me how I'm wrong for about a few seconds when I cut her off. I asked her if she was calling me a liar. She said no, but that she watched them make and pack up the wings to go and she knows they sent out the right ones. I told her that they were wrong and what were they going to do to fix it? She said she would send out our correct order but that we had to give them the old wings. I told her I would just go down there myself and that I wanted my money back. 
I take everything we hadn't eaten down to super pizza and told them I wanted my money back. Even though the guy behind the counter seemed nice and said he would give me the refund, that didn't stop Tracy from not knowing when to stop being rude. She kept giving excuses and changing her story. I asked her if the wings I brought back looked like bbq and she said no. The guy gave me the full refund and even offered me the bbq wings. I didn't take the wings but his politeness was appreciated. Tracy did not apologize once and had the hardest time admitting that she was wrong. See you next Tuesday, Tracy. I will never eat at this place again. Terrible food and worse service."}
{"text":"Super Pizza has the best pizza, period. The cheese steak is also amazing. I haven't had pizza like this since I was in New York!  Our family has also tried the Stromboli, the chef salad, which is huge, and the funnel cake fries.  All delicious, every time!  We are super fans!!!  Support this local family owned business."}
{"text":"I ordered the wings. There's a lot of fat on them and the mild sauce just isn't good. There's almost no flavor to them. The ranch was the only good thing about it"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from here. Their mozzarella sticks were good kind of salty, and their pizza has no flavor. The sauce has no flavor either. Was kind of disappointed. Probably won't be ordering from here again :("}
{"text":"2 strikes i'm out.

I pass this place quite often, but was kinda leery due to the plaza that it was located in but thought to give it a try anyway. First time I went there I ordered a cheese steak, which was bland as could be. I also didn't care much for the service , for it being not crowded I expected a little more prompt and friendly attitude. So that was try #1, a month later I had a craving for wings and was in the area so stopped in. Figured wings are an easy enough dish not to screw up, guess I thought wrong. Ordered the Parmesan wings which were bland and had no real taste. After 2  attempts with below avg outcomes I decided to seek future meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came from New York, only to find the best Pastrami Sandwich, in a Pizza Shop, in Nevada.  If you haven't ordered it yet, do it.  Mozz. sticks on point, too."}
{"text":"pretty taste you can tell that they use fresh ingredients and if you opt for pickup they have specials... But the delivery was wayyyyy long a few times I ordered for work and that is irritating. I am sure they are mom and pop so may only have one driver im not sure."}
{"text":"I have no doubt that this is THE BEST pizza in Henderson, no in Las Vegas.  It's a great Mom and Pop restaurant the owners were super friendly and helpful.  Joey M. had a request for them to make some cheesy bread that wasn't on the menu and they were more than happy to oblige.  The dough for the pizza and for the bread sticks are the best quality I've ever tasted.  The dough was light and fluffy, but the crust of the pizza were crisp, it had a great garlic taste that really brought out the flavor of the pizza.  The pizza sauce tastes like it was home made too, very tomatoey and you can taste the herbs in the sauce.  The best thing is probably the quality of the toppings.  The cheese was the best I've ever tasted in a restaurant's pizza.  The pepperoni was spicy, the bacon was crispy, and the ham was fresh and sweet.  We got a large pizza which is 16\" take-out special for $8.97 for plain cheese and extra for each topping.  We can usually finish a large pizza pretty easily, but I could only eat one slice of pizza, Joey had three slices.  We were more than happy to take the other half home and finish it today!  The large pizza with 3 toppings, special request of bread sticks, one soda came to about $22."}
{"text":"This place was a topic on the Las Vegas Yelp Talk forum so its only natural I check it out since there were high praises. Props to Kathy B for spreading the word out on this place. It's always good to support your local mom and pop shop.

With that said I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie. They bring it out to my table and I was amazed at how big it was! (That's what she said) I gotta say it was about a foot long. The bread itself seemed like it was freshly baked. Not bad for about 8 bucks.

If you check out their menu, they have plenty of other choices like chicken fingers, wings, fries, hot and cold sandwiches, calzones, strombolis, and of course, pizza! Heck, they even have cannoli's! They have all sorts of different specials everyday.

Service is very commendable. From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, the hospitality was pleasant. Bathrooms are nice and clean. The décor suits their name for they have all sorts of super hero stickers on their walls.

So whenever I am in the area, this place will definitely be on my radar as one of my lunch choices for I still have all of the other items I mentioned above to try."}
{"text":"Had their mini canollis delivered at the last minute for a work potluck.  Not only were they delivered on time, everyone thought the canollis tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on what the perfect Philly cheese steak sandwich, but this 7.99  lunch special at Super Pizza was monstrous like the Hulk, and pretty tasty. 

A few days ago, there was a posting about Philly Cheese Steaks sandwich in the Yelp's  talk forum about this place, and curiosity caught me.   It's not too far from the Galleria Mall, and pretty close by everything in the area; so I decided to check it out.

Located two blocks west of Stephanie Street on Sunset road, Super Pizza is in small strip center next to a Jack in a box.   One major heads up, if you're driving like an idiot on Sunset, you will pass this place without knowing it's there.   So please people, drive with some common sense in the area.   It's not the Las Vegas speedway on that part of Sunset road.

Super Pizza is a tucked away like the Bat Cave in this strip center on Valle Verde and Sunset, and parking is pretty easy to find.    When I walked in, I seen a few daily specials the board, but my mind was made up like the Bat signal for their Sandwich.   S.O.S. there was a nice white pizza slices ready to be saved, but thankful I didn't cave into buying a couple of slices (4.99 with a soda), because within five minutes I got my order.

Holy special delivery, my order was damn huge like the size of the marshmallow man in Ghostbuster.     My Philly sandwich was easily over a foot long, and was loaded with thin sliced steak, grilled onions, green and red peppers, and cheese.    Then, my Galactus sized fries came out...DAMN, it was clearly the same amount of fries as two super size McD orders.    The sandwich was very good, but there was one area to improve on, the bun could have been grilled a little longer.

The dining area has about 30 seats, and  looks like the Justice League headquarters with a number of super hero big heads on their windows.  Also the LED monitor was playing the original Superman movie from the 1950's, which was pretty cool.  Also I notice they had a large number of superhero DVD to watch, so I guess they rotated movies like the how the old Brown bagger at Puck Alley (in Honolulu)  use to show the old Three stooges and Laurel and Hardy movies.     Yeah, I have to admit, I was a comic nerd when I was much younger.  

Super Pizza hooked me with their sandwich, but will they catch me for the pizza in the area?  Well, looking at the pizza that came out, the chance are about the same as me checking out the next Iron Man and Superman movie this summer.   So you can count on it."}
{"text":"These guys are great!!! Always beat their ETAs by a long time. Philly Cheesesteak is the best around. Family owned and operated as far as I can tell and everyone has been super nice to deal with."}
{"text":"Ordered using 24 hour eats.

Some how the order was placed for pick up.

I caught the problem and was able to change it and have it delivered. 

I know there was the issue and that may have caused delayed time but I don't think that's any excuse for receiving my food with such poor quality. I've ordered from here before so I know that this is not normal. 

My Soda was delivered water down because all the ice had melted. If you're running behind the least you can do is replace the soda.

All my food was ice cold about the only thing edible was my salad. I ordered cannolis a three-piece and only received one. My burger was ordered to be well done and it was nearly raw."}
{"text":"We ordered the White Pizza,Pepperoni and sausage and a cheese pizza. All were fantastic, the white was phenomenal ricotta, garlic and mozzarella tasty and piping hot . Quality ingredients friendly  atmosphere and the staff are awesome friendly . Love the Super Heroes all around . If you want authentic east coast NY/NJ style pizza this place is a must! Oh the cannoli is divine! Definitely will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I went to Super Pizza after being tired of ordering from the same national chains and seeing the fall of Napoli Pizza to new management. I got a letter in the mail promoting a large 1-topping at reduced price so I decided, \"why not\".

I get there and it's at the old location of Fox's Pizza. Never went to Fox's so I assumed this was a rebrand. I went inside and was greeted by the owner. I asked about Fox's and she said they were a completely new team from the East Coast. East Coast = Good Eats to my West Coast mind, so I went ahead and ordered a Large Pepperoni, fries, and garlic knots.

The place is on the average scale for spaciousness, about half a dozen 4 seat tables. A small flat screen TV sits in the ceiling corner with a basic cable channel. The ordering area is a little cramped and the decor is nothing to write about. However, it was clean and this is what counts in my mind.

Now the food review:

The pizza tastes great. The hearty slices in the Large are big enough to get full off of just one. The dough is cooked just right and slightly chewy. The cheese is laid on thick and tastes like real cheese, no filler taste here. The pepperoni is crispy on the edges and they lay on a good amount. The crust is just how I like it: crusty. Not chewy like the national chains. This pizza gets a 9/10 from me.

Fries: Fries are fries, and you can't really screw those up. The only gripe I had was the price and the amount I was given: the equivalent of a large fry from a burger chain for 3 bucks. I think they can give a little more than that. 6/10 for the amount.

Garlic knots: Here is where they made up for the shortage of fries. The order had at least 20 delicious knots, with parmesan sprinkled liberally on top. They were slightly crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. They were a hit. 8/10.

Overall I have to give Super Pizza a 8.5/10. Without the promotion, the pizza will get slightly more expensive, and the fries just aren't worth getting. Next time I'll get the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"It's not a bird, or a plane or Superman. It's Super Pizza!!! Or is it? They REALLY need to change the name to Super Chicken Fingers or even Super Ranch Dressing. Super Pizza is a little extreme and needs to roid up and squat it out to live up to that name.

Super Chicken Fingers has the biggest, crispiest, white meat grubbin', butter lovin' fangers and sauce. You will lick your fingers and yes they will still taste good cold. The Super Ranch is loaded with Dill and the co-star is Garlic. Usually garlic is the leading lady, but not in this show. Only sometimes does the Dill seem to be showcased which is one of the reason I can't give Super Chicken Fingers 5 Stars. 

The pizza? Ain't all that super. It was decent and they seem to use quality ingredients, but the amount of cheese they loaded on to my pie was overwhelming and made it hard for me to enjoy the pie. I might as well put it directly on to my gut and thighs and rub it in real good using gentle strokes while listening to Frank Ocean by candlelight. A mozzarella cheese sensual massage. Yup, that would be super. This pie has major potential just don't use a heavy hand unless you are pouring me a stiff one and we can be friends.

The prices seem to be the same as every other pizza place. When it comes to pizza I just see red and don't care about prices or world peace or tomorrow. I definitely recommend giving them a chance. Especially after they read this review. 

P.S.
I think the employees should be required to wear capes and man tights."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would.

I've never had a problem with this place until now. I ordered food for my family and I and it was horrible! Let's start with the buffalo chicken pizza that's supposed to come with buffalo sauce instead of the traditional marinara sauce and there was absolutely no sauce on it at all! The only form of liquid I found on this pizza was oil. It was dry like the Sahara desert! And the chicken that was on it was breaded and it was so hard and there was more breading than there was chicken!

I also ordered bacon jalapeño house rolls and the bacon in those was just all fat and undercooked. We also ordered steak house rolls and my boyfriend said after eating a few, he started to feel sick.

When the food was in the process of being delivered, the delivery man had called me to let me know that he was here, which was odd at first because he could have just knocked on the door but, we didn't let that bother us too much at first. Well it turns out he wasn't planning on knocking at the door, he presumed we were going to come outside to get our food! So I sent my boyfriend out to get it and the delivery guy did not say a word to him at all! He just handed him the food, and left! My boyfriend was nothing but kind to this man, asked him how he was doing and also said thank you while receiving the food and even apologized even though it was the delivery man that was doing all the wrong things.

So with all of that being said, my father called up to this establishment and the manager answered and he voiced the above complaints. The manager was so rude, and he kept saying that the connection was bad and he couldn't hear him. He also kept saying that he couldn't do anything about these things, and the conversation finished off with the manager telling my father to \"come up here\" and bring the pizza.

So we go up to the place and the manager tells us there was buffalo sauce on this pizza, which there CLEARLY is not & that the bacon jalapeño rolls were made just right, stating that \"it's bacon\" and that he couldn't do anything to fix it! He couldn't give us a refund, nor did he offer to make us new food! So not only am I out of $40 including a $6 tip to the rude delivery guy, but I also have to find somewhere else to spend my money.

For a place that claims they have \"super service\", that's totally misleading and a lie. I'm not sure if there is someone new running this place but it is HORRIBLE! DON'T ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"So it's my second time there. I was at the nail salon next door and thought it would be convenient to get a snack or two.

SALADS: I love their salad! Good presentation. Lots of everything. Last time, I had the grilled chicken caesar salad and this time I had the buffalo chicken salad. It was great both times. It filled me up and they make their ranch in house from what they told me.

JALAPENO POPPERS: I would not recommend their jalapeno poppers! They were filled with cheese whiz, YUCK. The jalapeno itself had no flavor but I can say I enjoyed the breading even though it was a little burnt.

CANNOLIS: Thumbs up their cannolis! Maybe it's just I've always had a bad experience with cannolis. They were super fresh and not a bad price for 3.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: I did not enjoy talking to whoever placed my order. Tried to tell them to have a nice day and she already hung up on me. She seemed like she was too busy to answer my question about if the cannolis had chocolate chips in them. I called 20 minutes after I had already placed my order and she said she had to finish something up first. The first time I tried their food, it look less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place changed hands, and my son was so upset at the changes he cried. 
They took down all the superhero decor, removed the bouncy ball machine that my kids loved, and no longer allow the kids to make their own pizzas. They also dont have the coloring contest anymore and they changed the way the cheesesteaks were made, which was a big reason to come here. These were all the things we loved about this place - POOF - gone. 
I was super sad about all of this. 
My best wishes to the old owners, wherever you are. My best wishes to the new owners too, cuz this was one longtime customer who probably wont be back. 
Moral: if you buy a place and take over, dont make too many changes. You'll lose your customer base."}
{"text":"Super Pizza is on the way home from work so it was time to try the cheesesteak. Very friendly staff here. My order came out so quickly cuz we talked the whole time. Came to find out they do not use the amoroso rolls anymore. Not that big a disappointment to me. They would never be as fresh as getting them in Philly.
The cheesesteak was very good. Very flavorful and a big portion. I will definitely be back. I have to try the pizza again. I had a slice but they put more cheese on when reheating it. I would have asked them not to do that but didn't see this terror taking place. Not a fan of adding anything for a reheating of pizza. It's either there or not."}
{"text":"They are called Super Pizza, but We came here for some Cheesesteak action after reading about it on a recent talk thread.

Marvel Superheroes decorate the restaurant here, and the workers are very personable. We ordered a cheesesteak to share. The question was-did we want it \"Wit' Cheese?(Provolone) or \"Wit' Whiz? (Cheese Whiz) I asked the lady if they could do half and half, and she said\"no problem\".....NICE! Unfortunately Amoroso Rolls are no longer used because they would buy them frozen, and as soon as they got to Vegas, the quality wasn't the same, so they use a local bakery. The Lady assured me it was pretty damn close to the real deal, so I said to do it up like the locals do, with onions, peppers, and the two different cheeses. We also decided to order a cherry pie for dessert.

The Cheesesteak arrives and let me tell you, it is enough for two people! They serve it with skinny fries like Freddy's and very filling. although both of them were good, I prefer the provolone over the whiz. The pie was also good and different, being made from pizza dough, it was crisp, and chewy, and the filling wasn't overly sweet.

Forget Pops, this is the place to get your cheesesteak fix. Returning to try their pizzas in the future as well.They ARE Super Pizza right? Their pizzas must be super!?!?
ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Super delicious ! Now I wish I could of taken a picture of the pizza and cheesesteaks. But they were gone before another thought came up. Fresh ingredients, big slices and friendly staff. My new local go to spot for pizza !!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place half a million times since I live in the Whitney Ranch area, and finally decided to go give it a try after they sent out a letter to all the residents in Whitney Ranch.

Was happy to see they use EAT24 so I can order online and take advantage of our weekly coupon, but even still, the price of the large (16\") veggie pizza & garlic knots were on par.

Coming from the east coast, Boston, I'm always on the lookout for east coast style pizzerias. When I think east coast pizza I think of Boston's and New York's thin, flavorful style. This pizza was more inline with what you expect from Pizza Hut. Thick, boring dough, and bland sauce. While eating we had to add dried basil to our slices because there seem to be a local lack of seasoning in the sauce or cheese.

Overall, it was just a pretty boring pizza. It wasn't horrible, but the 'Meh. I've experienced better' 2 start rating is right on the nose."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed that I hadn't known about the cheesesteak until recently. I might have had it occasionally for lunch back when I was frequenting places in this area such as Ross J's and Chicken Shack, whose menus don't contain cheesesteak.

I had an errand to run in the vicinity, so I used the Yelp online ordering system to order ahead, courtesy of something called Eat24 that I'm not too familiar with. It's pretty cool - easy to specify what you want, make any special requests, select what time (5-minute intervals) you want it to be ready, and even leave a tip if you'd like.

I had selected a 12:00 pickup time but happened to get there 10 minutes early. Luckily, they were already getting it ready, so I had a small wait and was able to glance around. I guess they're Philadelphia Eagles fans, although I don't know if they'll air the non-nationally televised games. I do like the superheroes plastered all over the walls. I think my friend would like this place since he's a big fan of comic book characters (again, sad for lost opportunities).

So, the cheesesteak. I picked the super cheesesteak (onions, peppers, mushrooms for $7.95), which was actually not on the web site for some reason. I forgot about selecting a cheese, so they defaulted to provolone. It was pretty good! Tender meat throughout, pretty decent bread, just wish the filling wasn't so center-skewed so that I didn't have to start biting the ends off or else risk having empty bread at the end.

Given that it didn't pick up my tongue and slap the insides of my mouth with it, I wouldn't say it's a sandwich that's a must-try in the Vegas/Henderson area. But it's definitely a should-try if you're a local or passing nearby, and it beats the _cheesesteak_ at Capriotti's handily (maybe not the other sandwiches). I approve."}
{"text":"One thing about opinions is everyone has them. I ordered this pizza based on the reviews but I will never order from here again.

The pizza was not bad, but it wasn't good either. When you're in a town where pizza places are a dime a dozen and on every corner you have to at least be good. 

The dough was very plain, no flavor. The sauce was watery and also had no flavor. I'm about 90% to 100% sure they use canned mushrooms...yuck! Canned mushrooms are chewy and have almost a snail like texture. The pepperoni, sausage and cheese were good but I think the only thing that saved the pizza was that I had garlic added. I thought the added topping was a little over priced ($1.75) but it did taste like fresh garlic which like I said \"saved the pizza\".

There were good reviews. To each his own. I would hope the owners read this and take it to heart. I'm a huge supporter of small business and try not to buy from chains as much as possible. To the owners, fresh is better. I not only love pizza but I've worked at pizza places. People WILL pay good money for good pizza."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place to get pizza since I gave them a try almost a year ago. While I normally get the pizza I decided to try the chicken fingers (half bucket, which is 8 fingers) for $11. They ended up delivering a half bucket of chicken wings instead. I called them up and they apologized for the mistake and sent out an order of the chicken fingers with no extra charge. They even surprised me with a small order of fries as an extra apology. This was the first time they ever messed up one of my orders so it was the first time I got to see how they responded to this kind of mistake and I must say that I am not at all disappointed. As for the food:

Chicken fingers ($11 for 8 fingers): These are fairly good sized fingers. They are lightly breaded and covered in the sauce of your choice. I chose the medium spice sauce. They were good, especially for their price. If I had any complaint it would be that the medium sauce is not at all spicy so next time I will order the hot sauce and see if has any more of a kick.

Chicken Wings: These were actually even tastier than the chicken fingers. They did not appear to be breaded at all, which is very good news for a diabetic like me. They were only lightly sauced (I assume with the same medium sauce as the chicken fingers I had). The meat was properly cooked and was very juicy. If I had to complain about anything it would be the same as my complaint with the chicken fingers: the sauce was not at all spicy despite being labeled as medium wings. These wings are definitely better than the wings I usually get from a big name pizza place and were much cheaper to boot so I will be buying my wings from Super Pizza from now on."}
{"text":"I used to make fun of the name of this place because what kind of name is \"Super\" Pizza?. I was going to count it as a generic pizza place until I found a coupon on the back of a receipt at Smiths. My gf convinced me to go there and after reading the reviews I figured I should try the pizza (even though most people kept talking about their philly cheesesteak).

With superhero stickers all around the inside, I get where the \"super\" part comes from. We dined in and grabbed a large Pepperoni, Bacon and Ham pizza. On top of that when talking to the waitress they made some cheesy bread sticks (per request) which was really good. It wasn't like my hometown ones but the fact that they attempted something off of their menu which was still delicious was awesome.

As for the pizza. The crust was spectacular all the ingredients were fresh. I don't know what was in the cheese and sauce, but this was pretty much one of the best pizza's I've ever had. I love pizza in general so for me there really isn't a such thing as a bad pizza. But I am a major fan. I can see myself gaining some extra pounds at this place.

Check it out though!"}
{"text":"This is a small, family owned place (from the looks of it when my kids went) which is a GOOD thing because we LOVE family owned places. The food was good, friendly service and we would return! I wish they were located in a busier place. Anyway, we enjoyed the experience! :-)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Super Pizza and visited and many occasions and every time I have never been disappointed by the quality or portion sizes of the food. By far one of my favorite items on their menu is the Robert's Chicken Fingers especially when it's coated in their kicking garlic parmesan sauce. The sauce has just the right amount of flavor that leaves your mouth salivating with a little hint of butteryness added to it that makes you feel like you ate something deliciously bad for you.

One of the other great things about this place is that they do not charge at all for delivery. In this day and age that's a rare thing to find and with food that is better than the national chains or other local places like Napoli's then you have a win win. Add in two very approachable and friendly owners (a husband and wife team) and Super Pizza is simply a win."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. We have ordered twice, the slices are huge and filling, the delivery is quick and friendly. Since we moved here this pizza place has proved to be the best."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the area!  Had several people over and all agreed excellent pizza, wings, and hoagies.  Deliver was much faster than quoted."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful staff and always delivers our food extremely fast,  and often gives us extra sauces and fingers than what the menu says comes in a box.  The only thing that could be better is the ranch,  it is a little on the watery side. Otherwise very satisfying."}
{"text":"Super pizza did call back and apologized and replaced our whole order. Much better the second time. Meant to post this sooner but when I logged on to yelp the review was gone"}
{"text":"yum yummy!!!! i think ive had some good luck the last couple days. so i was reading the reviews about philly cheesesteaks and i figure i havent had one in so long because Las Vegas is definitely not a place where they have good phillys. Until Today.

Super Cheesesteak- Steak Mushrooms, Provolone cheese sauce, onions (you can get with peppers but i dont like them) - Best philly ive had since being in vegas for almost 11 years. The bread was super soft which was different but it was still good. 

Mild Chicken Wings- Came in an order of 12 and it was very good. The wings were crispy and they were decent sized. Werent overcooked i would definitely order it again. Sauce was light which i like. 

Looks like i have a new lunch spot to eat at when i decide to cheat on my diet like today. ill definitely order the philly and wings again. Thanks Super Pizza you guys make some good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"We order from Super Pizza on a weekly basis. Usually the special that comes with a large 1 topping, wings and a 2 liter soda.  Pizza has always been great and their ranch dressing is amazing!! Wings are tasty too! Always easy to order and pick up. Glad to have a place like this nearby!"}
{"text":"I got a cheesesteak delivered; the lunch combo with the soda and fries. Extra whiz and add mushrooms. A decent deal and it tasted aight. I wouldn't say it was GOOD; it was mediocre at best. The fries were pretty tasty, but it's hard to screw up fries. I probably won't do it again because the reviews said the cheesesteaks are the best thing they have...."}
{"text":"I have bought pizza from here a few times and it's always been great! My son is leaving for bootcamp in a few days and when I asked him where he wanted to go for pizza he picked Super Pizza! They are a family owned business, great customer service! Fantastic Food!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews about fresh ingredients and the pizza so we just got a vedgie pizza delivered. Honestly, I am really diappointed with the quality. Nothing about our pizza was actually fresh, the vedgies (peppers, mushrooms, etc.) were all canned vegetables. We won't be ordering pizza from here again for this reason. Gross. To the owners: don't be cheap with your ingredients or customers will notice and not return."}
{"text":"My dad ordered pizza while visiting him.  They had a one topping special.  It was good.  What I liked best was the size of their slices - huge.  Did not care for the sausage, sliced like pepperoni."}

\"Best Sicilian Pizza in Las Vegas, Super Pizza (Sunset/Henderson)\"

After reading countless reviews raving about the cheesesteaks at Super Pizza in Henderson, I decided  to give them a try. A few weeks ago I ordered their whole cheesesteak with cheese wiz. And like the reviews said, it was pretty good! It ran about $8 for a full sandwich which isn't too bad. While I was in there I picked up their menu which contained lunch specials. If you go in for lunch they knock a few dollars off or you can get a half of a sandwich with fries for about $5.50. I've been in a few times for lunch to pick up this special. 

If you've read my other posts on cheesesteaks you know I prefer my steak meat chopped. Super Pizza does not chop their meat which is what prevents it from topping my list as the best cheesesteak in Las Vegas. I have contemplated asking them to chop it to see the difference. I think I might have to do that the next time I order from them.

Last night we decided to give their pizza a try. Wanting something different we decided to give their Sicilian pizza a try. We went with the Italian which ran us about $22 and included sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese. We ordered it through Grub Hub and saved $7 by using promo code: EASY7.

When the gentleman arrived to deliver our pizza he was raving about the pizza telling us how good it was. He warned me that the box was heavy. I'm thinking, yea okay, it can't be that heavy! He was right, the box was easily 5 lbs! I think he said it weighed about 12 lbs. I was shocked and excited all at the same time.

As I opened the box I knew we were in for a treat! The smell was sensational, the cheese was perfectly melted and the sausage and pepperoni were glistening. The owners of Super Pizza are born and raised in South Jersey and you can taste it in this pie. The after taste of the crust it something I haven't tasted since I was back in Jersey.

I can't stress enough how  good this pie was! Two big thumbs up from us!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have something new in Imperial! I love the lunch special they offer of half a hoagie, fries and a 20 oz bottled soda...great price and the half a hoagie is a good size with a good amount of toppings. A co-worker and I also do the 2 gyros and 1 order of fries special which is great, their tzatziki sauce and ranch dressing is amazing. Fresh Cut Fries have a great seasoning on them, you don't even need ketchup! The hoagie rolls are Mancini's which make them even better! I haven't tried their pizza or stromboli yet but I hope to soon!
Super convenient to order/pay online with spaces for comments if there is a topping you don't want. On my lunch break I can easily order, run home to let my dogs and pick up my food on my way back to work."}
