{"text":"Best sauce Ever!!!! Love this place. Their hours are wrong on google and yelp. 
They are open Monday -Friday 11:30am to 9pm. Saturday's 4 yo 10 Sunday 4 to 9"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an unbelievable experience at this tiny strip mall Italian restaurant.  We actually went based on other Yelp reviews.

First off, the service was absolutely fantastic!  We were seated and waited on immediately.  Fresh warm bread with real chilled butter and a decent Cabernet to start.  They had so many specials - many of them seafood - pasta combinations.  The server made recommendations for my daughter who is a vegetarian.

My daughter opted for an eggplant special.  I ordered lasagna - had a craving for that!  My husband ordered a seafood pasta special.  Everything was piping hot with delicate noodles, flavorful sauces, and all was cooked perfectly!  The salads that came with the meal were fresh with a great Italian dressing!  And another basket of bread.....yum!  Finished the meal sharing a pistachio gelato....also delicious!

Usually Italian restaurants leave me feeling heavy.  This experience was not like that.  Everything was filling but not heavy and overdone!

Please go!  The place was not full on a Friday night.....and it should be!  We will be back again and again and again!  I can still smell that delicious aroma!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Hampton Inn and found Aldo's only 1 mile away and rated well on Yelp.  Called in a take out order for the Capellini alla Primavera Con Gamberi (angel pasta, with light rose' sauce and vegetables and shrimp).  Located on end unit of strip mall and looked like seating area of approx 30-40.  Food was ready when I walked in and got to use a portable tabletop device to pay with credit card (cool and printed receipt too).  Meal was still very hot/fresh when got back to hotel room.  The 4 large shrimp where very good and the whole dish was really great.  It wasn't overly flavorful but really loved it.  Side salad included and 2 thicker slices of bread/butter.  They impressed me and if I stay here for business again will definitely eat Aldo's Italian again!"}
{"text":"Ate at Aldo's with family for dinner. The restaurant itself was on the small side with not a huge number of tables.  It was completely family run.  Our server was in a family picture right behind the table.  The service was impeccable.  

For appetizers we had the stuffed mushrooms along with an order of the Sausage/Onion & Peppers W/fresh tomato sauce.  Both were absolutely fantastic.  They are must tries.  For my main course, I had the Veal Sicilian.  It was served fresh out of the oven.  While the veal was of decent quality, it was very thin.  They used a lot of sauce and mushrooms.   A little more meat would be nice, but it was still excellent.  

Everybody in our party of 8 was impressed.  I would strongly recommend Aldo's for anyone who is a fan of authentic, southern Italian food.  I will certainly be dining there again soon!"}
{"text":"Wanted an authentic Italian dinner and definitely got it at Aldo's. Everything was amazing... and even though our dinners came with salad and a side of pasta, the proportions were perfect so we didn't go into a food coma! (We especially loved the fresh salad and it's dressing.) I recommend the breaded mushrooms and chicken piccata. 

PS- The cozy atmosphere and friendly service only added to its authenticity."}
{"text":"Excellent service. We had the homemade lazagna which was exceptional as was the eggplant parmigiano. Good house cab as well."}
{"text":"Don't let location fool you - this quaint gem on Memphis Ave was a delight to eat at! I read great reviews during my trip to Cleveland for work, and this was down the street from my hotel so I gave it a shot. The inner d√©cor was adorable, with the classic Italian theme, but the personal touch of the owners photography from Italy hung on the walls.  I started with a glass of wine, bread, their house salad and ordered their recommended special, which was all delicious! It was a pasta with mussels and shrimp flavored with a delicious red sauce.  I IMMEDIATELY checked-in to this restaurant on facebook, recommending it to any family or friends who found themselves in the area.  The owner checked on me several times in addition to my hostess, and for good Italian, I thought the price was fair. PLEASE do yourself a favor and give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere, highly attentive & friendly service, and best of all excellent food and house wines.  We were very happy with our meals!  Looking forward to going back!  Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"We will be back. The place is small, the service is great and the food is fabulous. We went for lunch and ordered spaghetti and meatballs in meat sauce. We really like the meat sauce. The salad and warm bread we're also good. Nice place."}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service!  A real hidden gem of a restaurant. Very authentic feel. One of the best spaghetti dishes I've had in a long time.  Dessert was fantastic too. Looking forward to going back and exploring that menu."}
{"text":"Love it! Best Alfredo I have ever had. Their house dessert is out of this world too! Also, I enjoyed the small family style atmosphere! Nice place for date or family lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Aldos has been recommended to me for years - finally had a chance to try it yesterday for a business lunch.   Really very good.

Small House salad with blue cheese and house dressing was excellent.   Could have had a large one with some grilled chicken on it and been completely satisfied.   The greens were fresh and it was dressed lightly.    Fresh, warm bread came along for the ride.

Enjoyed the hot stuffed peppers for my entree.   Be warned - the sausage is homemade and VERY hot/spicy.  Wasnt sure Id make it through, but was able to soldier on and ate every bit.  

Finally, shared a piece of the spumoni cake  - probably least satisfying part of the meal.   It was fine, but not worth the calories in my opinion.

Aldo himself - along with his son - are a visible presence in the restaurant, checking in, chatting with diners and making sure the staff is on their toes.  Excellent service all around.

Highest compliment?   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can not figure how this place gets solid reviews.  Knowing the price, we waited for a birthday but what we got was a surprise. 

The place is small and when we arrived there was a big & loud group already there, so when the manager showed us to our table between them and a corner we asked if we could take the other open table in the back.  He told us it was for larger groups but then sat the next customers that came in anyway.(same size party). 

The waiter was really pushy with ordering drinks and although my wife caved but I did not get any alcohol, maybe that's why he overfilled my water glass and left the mess on the table. 

Bread was very good - one slice each - and don't ask for more or you will get attitude like being told that we were eating too fast.

Dinner was fine but way overpriced for the size / quality.  Desserts were not good or as described.   

After waiting for a long time to get the bill, the waiter wanted us to pay before we could even look it over. 

Payment was funny, waiter sits down on bench next to you and runs your credit card thru one of those machines they use at the flea markets.  Then he tells you to hit the tip button and stares at you while your trying to figure out how to say no thank you.

We ended up leaving a tip, but were then followed out to the parking lot, where the manger had the balls to ask if everything was ok with the meal."}
{"text":"Gave aldos 3 stars. 1 for really nice waitress. 1 for the best pizza crust anywhere ever. 1 for my daughters veal parm. Lost a star for seating us first (since we came into empty dining room) then serving the next 6 tables before us. Seems lunch crowd knows owner so their food gets hurried to them while new customers wait. Also, they were out of linguini noodles and penne replacement not so great. The sauce was like thin milk--no thickness. The baby loved it because she likes plain noodles. The lasagna seemed fine but over-priced $12.95 for lunch. Yelp menu prices for this place are all wrong. My angel hair w seafood was only o.k. For $21.95 was a ripoff. The wedding soup was really good but still $4.50 for mostly          spinach flavored water. Still, it was the best thing I ate. Would like to say pistachio gelato was good but they were out of that too. We waited so long that good thing portions were small--I had eaten lots of bread while waiting. You know, maybe i'm wrong about some things. But I am certainly not wrong that $100.00 is too much for a mediocre lunch for three people (no wine). Never again. And yelp needs to fix menu prices. (Most of it isnt available for lunch but lunch prices very high.) I feel like i've been robbed.  For excellent food--no problem
--for aldos I feel cheated.  Waitresses were super and owner friendly--nothing else to say except they make  Carrabbas look good."}
{"text":"I have to agree with others, this is the best Italian place in Cleveland.   Aldo is an absolute sweetheart and we love visiting him there.  Its small, but he has seated our family of 6, plus a few friends without an issue.  The stuffed peppers are one of the best dishes that I have had anywhere.  Expensive, but worth it for a date night now and again."}
{"text":"Had my best ever Italian seafood dinner at this place ! Great service . This place provides service in real Italian family dinner style settings !!"}
{"text":"Top notch start to finish. Service, entree, desert, coffee and atmosphere all excellent."}
{"text":"Overpriced dull food not as good as it once was. 3 spaghetti dinners 45$. The spaghetti was watered down. The food took forever, and the service didn't feel like a high class restaurant. What a major let down."}
{"text":"This a hole in the wall but a gem of a restaurant.  I had the veal Sicilian and it was to die for.  Questionable neighborhood and hard to get to, but well worth the effort.  A great value and I would definitely go back.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We Yelped Italian with the highest rating close to where we were and ended up at Aldo's .  It's a cramped little restaurant but that's because almost every table was full.  

While the selection isn't huge for a non-seafood eater, I still had a hard time deciding what to get.  My husband and I each ordered the veal parm and we got an 8\" pizza as an appetizer.

Every bit of food, the salad, the bread, the pizza, the veal and the spaghetti were great!    The veal was very fresh - you could hear them pounding it out when the order is placed.  

Glad we Yelped it!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience here tonight. So amazing I had to post immediately after we left. 

We came in to a busy restaurant with maybe 2 available tables. I was carrying our 3 year old because he was sleeping and we just wanted to stop somewhere to grab a bite before heading back to Columbus. There was no host stand and we walked right into the dining room. We were greeted immediately with servers apologizing that there were no both seats available to put our sleeping child. I said it was ok, I could hold him and they gave us a table in the middle of the small dining room. 

Our server was so kind and knowledgeable. She was helpful with the menu and asked us questions based on our dietary restrictions and hunger levels. Warm crusty bread was on our table and we had no idea when that happened. We ordered the appetizer eggplant parmesan.  It was so rich and delicious. Perfectly seasoned and the marinara was so good. 

When a booth opened up they encouraged us to lay our son down and continue to enjoy our dinner. We did and the owner put a couple of chairs next to the both seat so our so wouldn't roll into the floor. He turned down the lights and jokingly said he would tell new patrons that \"I paid the bill! I don't know what happened!\" We had pizza and sauteed calamari. The server brought us more marinara for dipping because I had said how good it was. Both dishes were very good! The calamari was great with the right amount of chew, saltiness and a slight crispy outside. Our son woke of course in time for dessert! Everyone was so sweet to him and told him how happy they were he was finally awake. 

I'm so sorry this is so long but our experience was so unlike any other and it really made our day. We will make a special trip from Columbus just to eat there. They made us feel so special!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Had the chicken cacciatore.  Recommended!  My dining companion had eggplant parmesan which she mentioned was the best she ever had."}
{"text":"Yeah...this is the good stuff.

Went here with a group of co-workers on our monthly food adventure.  I always get to choose, and this was a no-brainer!  Old-school Italian food served in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  The owner greeted us enthusiastically and checked in on us regularly.

I had heard good things about their lasagna, so I decided to give it a try for lunch.  Our meals came with a really nice salad with house made Italian dressing and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.  The lasagna came out in a piping hot crock covered in melty cheese.  After I let the molten concoction cool a bit, it was time to dig in.  The dish was really good with a slightly tangy and sweet red sauce atop layers of noodles, cheese and meat.  The bread (served in a basket) was warm and delicious (especially dunked in the red sauce).

Several of my co-workers were tempted to order from the amazing dessert tray brought to the table after our meal.  I resisted, but later they all commented how wonderful their treats were.  Maybe next time Aldo's, maybe next time...

...and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Great little quaint restaurant.  Authentic Italian.  I was referred to this place by a friend of mine.  She said it was, \"the best\" Italian place in Cleveland.  Well, I have to say, it's very good.  BUT if I were to do a throwdown between the marinara sauce at Aldo vs. the marinara sauce at La Dolce Vita in Little Italy, La Dolce Vita has the better marinara sauce.  Still, the quaint atmosphere and Italian vinaigrette and service at Aldo's make it a special dining experience.  Next time we go back we'll try one of the specials and possibly a seafood dish."}
{"text":"l have been visiting this place for years.  First off, great fresh prepared food!  I love the Veal Sicilian so much that we celebrate my birthday here as often as I can!  It is small and has no real \"atmosphere\" other than \"neighborhood\" Italian place, but for the food, I would give it 6 stars if I could!

If Olive Garden is your standard, then shop there. If you want fine Italian food in a simple place, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! My friend wasn't so hungry but I ordered for him because I didn't want to seem like a complete fat girl! Lol so we got the stuffed mushrooms, they were in a awesome red sauce and cooked perfectly. I had the mussels which were flavored very well and cooked well!! They came with side salads, with a delicious dressing and a side of spaghetti... will be going back to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Did not see that they were closed on Mondays.  Walked in to a private party, but was invited to stay and eat with the owner (Aldo) and his friend. Great food and great company."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! The food is very good..tastes homemade. The service is great..my only complaint is that the bar is very limited to wine and basic beer..so don't expect a fancy drink here. Although, the owner did give our entire party of 8 a complimentary liquore at the end of our meal. The space is very tight so don't go hear if you want to have a very intimate conversation..but it reminds of lots of little Nyc restaurants where you sit shoulder to shoulder. Love the place! Food is authentic Italian..I say try it! 
Oh, and we went there one night in the summer and turned out they were going to close because the power was out..I was so disappointed that they offered to set us up a table on the sidewalk out front and serve us there or inside by candlelight..which we chose since the front is not too appealing. Well..once others saw us in there, they came in and the place ended up packed in the pitch dark! We had a fun time! If that doesn't say the place is good, I don't know what does if we all willing to eat there in the dark! Ha. The owners and staff are real troopers!!"}
{"text":"A well-connected member of our club raved over Aldo's and it took only seconds to see why!

This is a smaller restaurant in a strange strip mall but it kind of feels like you sneak back into some VIP only true Italian kitchen. 

We loved talking to the Chef and servers and the atmosphere is cozy. Everyone ordered something different in our large group and I heard no complaints. I had a special, beef Romano, which was probably one of the most amazing beef dishes I've ever had. Seriously, I am expecting so I made him cook a tenderloin to medium and it was STILL delicious!! 

My husband had a delicious veal dish and then ordered what I originally wanted, the pistachio gelato and it was SO good!  I had the cake dessert and it was okay but I wish I'd stuck to my instincts! Lol 

Truly impressed with Aldo's. Probably one of the best meals we've had since we moved here. It is not cheap and will be a treat but worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time yesterday evening.  Cozy restaurant with 10 tables.  Very friendly owner and staff.  Started with the garlic cheese bread and sauteed calamari.  Both were very good.  Chose the eggplant parmesan off the menu, not the special that evening, with the pasta olio/aglio at a price of $16.95.  Eggplant was very good and pasta was on the dry side but had flavor.  I felt the portion was really small for the price...really small.  Finished with the spumoni roll and it was very good!  Glad we tried it but would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Aldo's has the BEST lasagna ever!  Their fresh salad and crusty Italian bread compliments the meal.  We had our dinners to go & everything was carefully packaged & arrived home fresh, hot & ready to eat.  I can't wait to go back!
What a treat!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night,  they lost our reservation, but apparently it wasn't a problem at 6pm.   Later at 8pm they were packed.   
The place is tiny, and you can tell they've been there 25 yrs because the staff knows exactly how to make the tiny space work.

My group tried several appetizers, ban peppers were truly spicy, stuffed mushrooms delicious and pesto pizza was just ok, the crust didn't seem homemade.

However dinner was fabulous, salads and house dressing all fresh.  Homemade lasagna takes them all- that marinara!  Veal Piccata was delicious, one of the best I've had- only could have used a few more capers. 

Dessert was our favorite, pistachio gelato, and I had a gelato layered mix of banana, choc and vanilla with bits of dried fruit. WOW!

Reasonably priced for homemade italian dishes...we found the place from an article in Smithsonian magazine.  

Good for any type of group, business, friends, family and kids.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite italian restaurants.  My first time there was when I was probably 12 and my dad brought us there.  Family owned, nice people and great food.  Now 15 years later I'm still going and I've been a regular there for many many years!  I've brought my long time GF, now wife there regularly and it's our secret restaurant.  Their calamari is amazing and their aldo's special is my favorite!  Food comes with a salad and sadly I'm not a fan of their salad dressing so I usually pass on that.  They seem to be very busy a majority of the time and I'm unsure whey they don't expand but the little cozy feeling is refreshing at times.  Be aware though, this place is pricey and wait times tend to be a bit lengthy."}
{"text":"I got the Beef Fungetto and hubby got the tuna, both meals were fine, service was good, dinner for two with tip, $80, kinda steep for what your getting"}
{"text":"I have been to Aldo's at least a dozen times through three years....As usual the super delicious meal/Turned into a birthday party for 8 was awesome.  Best server ever ...the Irish woman(sorry about the name...it's just me).  Great Food is an understatement....from the hot peppers w/ hot sausage and a sauce to die for...mmmmmgood...My special meal was a cioppino style fish Menagerie with sauce from heaven on top of the best angel hair ever(NOT KIDDING) OMG!!!! I could go on and on but food coma is fast approaching so gotta go....just like you should GO to Aldo's"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! We almost second guessed it -- BUT DON'T! It was the best place for REAL Italian cuisine and atmosphere! The owner Aldo is an absolute sweetheart and was very involved with the guests! The service and food was better than I could have ever expected! Do not miss out on the stuffed peppers, salad or FRESH bread for an appetizer! We just had our first visit today 3/04/2016 and are already planning our second for tomorrow with family!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Aldo's from my former boss, a sophisticated, beautiful woman with a heart of gold and a flair for fashion, wine and food.  She'd traveled America and Europe and had dined in many an upscale establishment. When she raved about this tiny trattoria in Brooklyn, I knew we just had to give it a try.

Aldo's sits at the corner of a small strip plaza on Memphis Avenue, and you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a take-out pizza joint.  This place is remarkably small, yet absolutely adorable. It seats approximately twenty or so patrons, with an innovative bar/server station tucked into a nook adjacent to the kitchen entrance. Seating can be tight, especially along one of the banquettes that run along the periphery of the room.  Several small two-top tables are also available, but were all occupied during our visit.  The close quarters could be disconcerting to some diners, and is something to consider if you decide to visit.

Fortunately, the food at Aldo's was everything my boss had gushed about, and then some.  We're talking antipasto, pizzas, lasagna, piccatas, marsalas, fettuccine, ravioli, gnocchi, tiramasu, zabaione and everything in between, finished off with coffee and sambuca.  We both chose one of the evening's specials, a mixed seafood scampi served with lightly seasoned white rice and mixed vegetables.  Tender shrimp and scallops, cooked perfectly.  

We struck up a brief conversation with another couple-regulars enjoying a Saturday night out-who beamed when they bragged about how the kitchen makes a special wedge salad for them with Bleu cheese and house dressing \"on the side.\"

Aldo himself was ever-present during our visit, mingling amongst the tables; making sure his guests were enjoying their meals. His face lit up when we told him it was our first visit, seemingly flattered that we chose his restaurant based on a glowing  recommendation. 

For authentic Italian cuisine, Aldo's delivers...although we will probably return on a weeknight for a more subdued dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service at Aldos! We most recently went for my birthday, and I wasn't the only one with a birthday that night... Everyone in the restaurant sang happy birthday to each other. I guess you'll have that with good wine and good food! I always look forward eating here."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Arrived early dinner time and Aldo invited me to sit with him while he worked, what a sweet thing to do. One of the first things I noticed was the fine China, a very nice touch. After conferring with the staff and Aldo as was my first visit because I am from out of state, I decided upon the veal picatta, one of my all time favorites. Absolutely delicious. The meal started with hot fresh bread and butter, followed by a tasty mixed green salad with homemade dressing, yummy. Entree with delish al dente mixed veggies and side of angel hair with marinara. Frankly I enjoyed everything. I didn't find desserts listed on the menu so I asked for the dessert menu.  Was told there was no dessert menu but...there was a dessert tray...enticing. My waitress brought a tray with several offerings, I had difficulty choosing but my selection was wonderful. I enjoyed the coffee with dessert, which I noticed when I looked at the bill was a reasonable $2 for an endless cup. And if that wasn't enough, I noticed that the little girl at the table across from me eating with her parents had gone into the back room and returned with another of the desserts that looked so yummy. Apparently Aldo let her choose a dessert which she was obviously enjoying. With such a friendly warm family atmosphere, there's no doubt in my mind that he just let her have the desert gratis. I wanted to let him know how much I appreciated him, the meal and the experience. I gave him a hug and talked for a minute before leaving. What a special man and what a wonderful restaurant. If I make it back to Cleveland, Aldo's will be one of the first restaurants that I visit... guaranteed."}
{"text":"A quiet, quaint little restaurant located in a small center. Clean inside. Very attentive wait staff and owner came to chat and ask how everything was tasting. Great for a date night. Had lasagna and a glass of wine. Lasagna was baked fresh so it took some time but was well worth the wait. 

Also, according to some other poor reviews, not as good as \"Olive Garden\"... If you eat at olive garden and think that's the hallmark of Italian food, you're part of the problem."}
{"text":"This fine upscale establishment is an authentic departure from the boring mainstream commercialized garbage that you get at chain restaurants.  The chef is from Italy and he prepares fresh, simple, standardized, yet creative Italian fare that comes in generous portions - he is a true master of his craft! The prices are fair and each entre comes with homemade bread and a salad.  As far as the food is concerned, it is unequivocally delicious and uniquely authentic! However, the intimate setting is what truly brings out the character of Aldos; the dim lighting blends in with the small dining room, giving it a romantic feel."}
{"text":"I'm all for hole in the wall type places, but I  felt like this place could use a facelift. 

Prices of around $20 for our entrees felt just a tad high, honestly. (Veal and chicken piccata) while they did come with bread and a salad, the entrees looked pretty small. 

Dessert is where it's at though!!! Get the spumoni roll. Amazing."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and authentic, the service was quick and friendly. Most people will not be disappointed. Ask for the Wedding Soup (it's not on the menu)."}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian fare in a friendly setting. The prices were higher than what I'd been led to expect from the \"explore the menu\" feature here on Yelp, so that needs updating. The wines by the glass are a pleasingly affordable $6 a glass, so I had some Chianti with my spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was done perfectly and the sauce was delicious, but I'm not a big fan of these meatballs. They just lacked flavor. The salad that arrives before the meal was great, with a nice vinaigrette. I was told by a dining companion that the lasagne was very good. Service is a bit on the hard sell side, which I dislike."}
{"text":"We found Aldo's on Yelp during a visit to Cleveland and were not disappointed.  The food was outstanding and the service was excellent!

We stopped for a late lunch at an odd time...mid-afternoon on a weekday, and we were the only customers in the place.  We found it to be very quaint and it felt much like some of the small family-run restaurants we have visited in Italy.

The salads were very fresh and the house dressing was tasty.  The bread tasted like it was just from the oven.  The entrees we ordered, lasagna and angel hair prima vera, were both delicious, and we split them so that we could each enjoy both.  The sauces in both dishes seemed home-made, the portion sizes were just perfect, and the prima vera pasta was loaded with a variety of fresh vegetables.  For dessert we ordered the spumoni and pistachio gelato, and both of them were also fabulous!

The waiter was very attentive and struck up a friendly conversation with us, since we were his only customers.  We couldn't have been happier with our choice of eating establishments....we probably haven't had Italian food this good since we were in Italy!"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Cleveland! Family owned and entire family is hands on. Food is out of this world! You feel like you're dining in Italy. Restaurant is intimate and has wonderful ambiance. Service is top notch! If you want a true traditional Italian dining experience, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressive.  I had low expectations given the location, but we were pleasantly surprised.  Tiny TINY place, with no place to wait if they're busy, so be prepared for that.  Maybe 10 tables.  Our waitress was excellent, one of those career waitresses that knows everything there is to know about the menu.  Super efficient, our water never went dry and everything arrived in a timely manner.

I ordered an angel hair seafood scampi-style dish, based on her recommendation.  The seafood was done just about perfectly (although they don't tail their shrimp, which drives me a little nuts).  Everything was seasoned well.  My wife got the eggplant parm and was impressed.  Entrees come with rather large side salads and excellent bread.  The house salad dressing wasn't great...tasted like oil & vinegar with not enough vinegar.

It's not all wine and roses at Aldo's, however.  The dining area is very tiny and extremely loud, more like a busy corner bar on a Friday night.  Don't plan on any intimate conversations there.  The prices were a bit on the high side, with entrees averaging around $22.  That seems like a lot, given the location and atmosphere, plus the portions were smaller as well.  For that kind of dosh at an Italian restaurant, I generally expect to have leftovers.  For comparison, my wife and I like Stella Mia Ristorante in Westlake.  It's also in a strip mall, but the ambiance is MUCH nicer and the food's of a similar quality.  And you get quite a bit more of it, for similar pricing.

To sum up, they do a lot with what they have at Aldo's, and if you're in that area and want to stay local, it's a solid experience.  But if you don't mind driving, there are better overall choices."}
{"text":"Took my GF to Aldo's after finding it through Yelp for her birthday. What a great little find! The food was great and the desserts were out of this world. We'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We stopped by an hour and a half before they were supposed to open, but the owner was there and let us in. Felt very welcome and ate lots of homemade Italian food."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hampton Inn and they recommended and I'm glad they did. It was a small quaint place and I later found out the owner was my waiter. Food and service were very good and I'll be back for sure. The bread that came with the meal was one of the best I've had"}
{"text":"After writing so many 3-star reviews of places that everyone else simply raves about I've started to wonder if I just don't like anything. That's why I was pretty hesitant to even try Aldo's. Seems like everyone loves this place. Add to that the fact that I never go out for Italian food and you could see why it wasn't that high on my list. So what overcame the activation energy? Bada Bing...

I've been bingeing on episodes of Sopranos for the last few weeks so my head's been swimming in manicotti and cannoli. Aside from a primer on the RICO Act that show's a treatise on Italian cuisine - they're always eating. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it was only a matter of time before I had to seek out some food from the boot. This place is a stone's throw from my front door, some Yelpers I respect gave it high marks and it's not an Olive Garden, Brio or Bravo. 

Let's set the scene. Late afternoon, a small, out-of-the-way strip mall populated by a smokeshop, dentist, massage parlour and salon in the blue collar city of Brooklyn. Aldo's is the lone culinary standout. The signage overhead a script \"Aldo's\" and the Italian flag, frozen mid-wave. 

We entered the front door into a short, narrow hall, two-top tables lining the wall, specials board on the wall straight ahead. We were immediately greeted by a smiling, silver-haired gentleman we could only assume was Aldo himself. He gestured to the handwritten specials list and asked with words drenched in the sing-songy accent of his home country if it was our first time. I nodded and he proceeded to lead us to our table toward the back. He took our drink orders and brought waters and fresh-baked bread.

Dimly lit, textured walls painted warm gold and decorated with the unsmiling, old-timey faces of family, the space is definitely tight though not uncomfortably so. I wonder if there's a secret back room for sit-downs? I've been watching too much tv. Our server, Katie, was genuinely pleasant with a love for the restaurant that was evident in her delivery. She was patient, knew the menu intimately and really made our experience. We had studied the menu before our visit so we already had a plan. Lascia mangiare.

The bread - Who doesn't love warm, crusty bread smeared with butter? It's almost genetically programmed in us, right? This bread is perfect.

The calamari - Lightly breaded, sauteed a crispy golden brown and served with warm marinara sauce. A wonderful way to start the meal.

The pizza - Sausage and pepperoni on an 8\" pie. The sauce was fresh and full of roasted tomato flavor and the crust had a slight sweetness I found pleasant. Fresh basil was a nice touch. A solid offering.

The chicken marsala - We went classic with this one. The chicken, pounded thin, was fork-tender and the mushroom wine sauce, while rich, wasn't heavy. I've had this dish a lot and this rendition was spot on. The accompanying vegetables, a mixture of zucchini, broccoli, carrots and peppers was underwhelming and just barely cooked. I prefer my carrots and broccoli on the softer side. The side of angel hair pasta with red sauce wasn't noteworthy, tasty, but not memorable.

The side salad - It came with the entree. A fresh mix of greens, red cabbage, julienned carrots and a vinaigrette loaded with a field of garlic. We opted for a topping of shredded mozz. The dressing was delicious and this made for a nice intermezzo before the entree.

The spumoni roll - We'd never had spumoni before and it looked great on the dessert tray. The ice cream was smooth, balanced by the textural elements from the dried fruit and nuts and the liquor-soaked cake was potent. A unique dish, for sure, but not one I'd order again.

Aldo's is everything everyone else says it is - intimate, unpretentious, charming, a hidden gem. We dine early so there were no crowds. We felt welcomed by everyone and the service was brilliant. Sure, the food is good and, since I've never been to Italy, I couldn't tell you how \"authentic\" it is, but I didn't have anything during our visit that had me dreaming of another helping. What I did have were thoughts of a repeat visit to try something else and experience more of the hospitality that this place has oozing out of every red, white and green pore."}
{"text":"First off service was phenomenal!  I had perfect pasta, lots of veggies and plump shrimp in a lighg blush sauce. The gelato was to die for. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great pastas. Their specialty is veal. I opted for the lightly breaded seafood with a side of pasta with alfredo sauce. My wife and I shared the pistachio gelato which was also very good.
The service was first rate"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for the weekend and wanted some Italian. I Yelped this place and was happy I did. I called in and asked for the typical fare that they probably don't like... I wanted Fettucini Alfredo and Chicken Parmesan which are not on the menu. I am assuming that Matteo is a family member or part owner just watching his interaction when I arrived but over the phone he basically told me not to worry about what the menu said, tell him what I wanted and that's what they'd make. When I arrived, the food was ready. I was the annoying customer that asked for extra sauce for both dishes so, he went into the kitchen which by the way had an open door and THEY MADE MORE FROM SCRATCH. 

Matteo's family, older members were in the hallway talking to family. I was treated so well and made to feel right at home. When I arrived to my hotel and ate my food, I literally almost revamped my schedule so I could go again the next day before I left. The food was just delicious. You have to understand that when they make it there from scratch, it tastes fresh and NOT like the Olive Garden. I won't forget the way the employees and the guests for that matter treated me. I am unashamed to say this but the next morning, before housekeeping could come, i took a little piece of bread and wiped this inside of my carryout. It was that good. They deserve a great rating and a thorough review. I will GLADLY come back. 

If you want to sit down and eat Stouffers, stay at home. If you want great food Go here. Nope, it's not fancy but who cares? It's clean ( you can look right into the kitchen) and delicious."}
{"text":"I worked with Aldo's old business partner and they always said he had good food. I went here for the first time back in 2003 and I remember Aldo coming to sit on the table with us and had some of my brother's wine, we talked about the football game on the TV (Milan-Inter) and told us about his kids, his town in Italy, etc. He brought us espresso at the end of a very good meal. I've tried just about everything on the menu but my favorite thing is the rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms. Their dessert tray is also top notch. Very small place, and I'm not sure they take reservations on a regular basis so plan ahead. I think this is some of the best Italian food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"To put it simply this is the best Italian food in Cleveland! The only thing I would change is making an update to the dining area....it's pretty dated."}
{"text":"So glad I listened to Yelp! This place is indeed a gem. Great food, good service, and a pleasant experience overall. Also, they were great abt our 2 year old and if you get an entree it comes with a side of pasta that is perfect for toddlers! I loved the bread, salad and chicken marsala. My husband devoured the lasagna and also enjoyed the Italian wedding soup. The owner came by and offered the kid a little ice cream treat for being so good in the restaurant. She is a big fan of Aldo! :) we are too."}
{"text":"Have been twice when in town for work for lunch. Got the chicken Marsala once and rigatoni with meatballs another time both were splendid. While the food is good it's the authenticity and true Italian feel that makes this place great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary on New Years Eve since we originally had plans to celebrate at the place we were married but due to a fire was cancelled on us last minute.

We were told ahead by Aldo's no reservations could be made so we arrived at about 5 and had to wait 30 minutes. The waiting area consists of a hallway but the gentleman was nice enough to bring wine when we asked if there was a bar ( we are first timers) 

I kept accidentally knocking down someone's walker on the floor which was quite annoying and noticed someone was leaning on a wine rack and it kept swaying, (SCARY) the waiting area has halogen lights above so it's very hot and no sitting.

The bread was a bit burnt and it seemed to be the waitress's first night, she didn't introduce herself, she walked up and said \"Do you want an appetizer?\" My husbandsaid Hello, How are you... When I said it was our first time here and inquired more she just explained that it's too bad we were here on such a busy night and u can tell her immediate goal was to get us in and out asap, not how we wanted to enjoy our wedding anniversary but I understand busy. The waitress had a  \"tat\" peeking out of her chest which is fine when I go to a bar or casual place but seemed odd in this setting... Our total was near 100 bucks so I expect a little better service. When I asked her how long she's been at the establishment she said a year and a half... She read us no specials and took no additional time then needed to make our dinner special so her tip reflected that. I liked the calamari but my husband did not, he said it was burnt tasting. He got Veal parm and I got the Aldo's seafood special which (I was referred to this restaurant by a special lady in Solon she said to ask for spicy red sauce ) I requested with \"spicy\" red sauce and the waitress told me to throw some red pepper flakes on it which she pointed to on the table... OK she said that's all the kitchen would do anyways. It was good, liked it all but my husband just wasn't feeling any of it. He said the veal was too buttery tasting and he asked for a side of rigatoni which she told us as she set the meal down that \"they ran out of it\" UMMM OK it was 6:00. We opted to not get dessert and get the heck out since we were feeling rushed and pushed anyway. We were some of the youngest clients in there and my husband is a huge fan of Nido Italia so it will be hard to get him to come back even though I enjoyed the food. 

I think if they would have taken reservations and staffed accordingly the service would have made a more enjoyable experience overall. The service killed our experience here and would probably prevent us from coming back. We don't get out often having a 1 year old so we were really looking forward to this, the place is very small."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and it's always been wonderful. However, it has been a while. We ate here last week. I had the halibut special which was delicious. They were able to find some cheese ravioli for my daughter! My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs while inexpensive was very disappointing. The meatballs were clearly frozen and not homemade which I would expect from this restaurant. Hopefully it will get better!"}
{"text":"Good food I had was a yummy salmon on top of spinach with capers. The rest of food wasn't disappointed either too."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous.  The wait staff is outstanding.  But, I think we are done with our Aldo's experience.  The problem isn't the food or the staff.  It is the size of the place.  We have been to Aldo's probably eight times over the last two years.  Every single time, there are one or two \"celebration dinners\" there at the same time.  Now, this isn't Aldo's fault, except that maybe they should consider when they take reservations to limit how many celebrations they will allow at one time.  We were there yesterday.  The first birthday celebration (party of nine) arrived at the same time we did (4:30).  And because they were also expecting an even bigger group (a party of 13) at 5:30, we were jammed into a very uncomfortable booth/corner.  And, lucky us, we got stuck with the second group sitting very up close and personal to our table.  Truly people, if you are bringing such a large group to a restaurant, why do you pick the smallest restaurant on the west side of Cleveland?  And, by the way, this isn't your dining room, so don't hold conversations (or arguments) the length of the table.

Again, none of this is Aldo's fault and maybe we should try lunch on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Probably the smallest little building ever, so it is easy to pass up! It is such an intimate setting, so it would be a perfect place for a date night. The servers are so nice, and they seem to know the menu inside and out. They started us off with a serving of bruschetta (amazing!) and then fresh, warm bread.  I ordered the angel hair pasta, and it was soooo good. To my surprise, it had mussels, scallops, and shrimp in it! The prices are pretty average for an authentic Italian restaurant. I would definitely stop in here again!"}
{"text":"Checked out the reviews before we made the decision to come, since the reviews looked good thought it would be a good choice...not so much. 

I ordered a coke and it came out in a warm can, of course served with a cup of ice. No free refills and the menu didn't even state that. 
The menu was pretty small and prices were between $12-$20. I expected the food to be top notch. All entrees come with warm bread and salad with their homemade italian vinaigrette dressing, the dressing was pretty good. I guess this place is known for their seafood but I'm not much of a seafood so I went for the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. Since I am in love with olive gardens I pretty much compare everyone's to theirs.  I was really in the mood for pasta with white sauce but this was the only one they offered. My first bite tasted like the smell of gym locker feet..totally disgusting.   I took a few bites and that was it. No more for me.
My boyfriend ordered the lasagna and when it came out it looked like soup..lasagna is supposed to be layered not looking like straight soup. We barely touched out food and wasn't asked how it tasted.  Needless to say we did not ask for boxes and will not be returning. 
The bread was good though!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the coziness of this place and the food was great! The Merlot is excellent. I had the chicken picatta and my hubby had rigatoni. If you are in the neighborhood or make a special trip. Its worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to a clam bake with friends at this little gem last night. We were welcomed at the back door (they are redoing their parking lot in front) by Aldo himself and led through the kitchen to a great table.  It felt like being welcomed into the family home. The place was packed!  (Regular restaurant closed this night only for the special clam bake event).  A lot of the crowd seemed like family or regulars so I felt privileged to be included in the event. (Our friends know the owner). 

The wait staff was so friendly and helpful. They worked as a team as it was a busy night with all the courses of the bake. Broth to start, savory, salty and very hot. Chowder next, hearty and tasty as all get out. Seafood crepe as appetizer in a Pomodoro type sauce. Fresh and tasty. Bring on the clams!  We knocked out 10 dozen at our table alone. Delicious middle neck. Tender, slightly sweet and delicious in the drawn butter provided. Now, the entree...lobster tails and filet accompanied by candied, spiced sweet potatoes and corn served up family style.  Thank goodness I had a light lunch!   We finished it all off with Spumoni wrapped in pound cake, cannoli and fresh fruit. 

I have heard great things about this place for some time but have never managed to get there. So glad we went!  We will definitely be back for more. Make a reservation. It's a small place."}
{"text":"I feel like a total gangstar when I eat here and sometimes with I could hear what the walls have heard. This small family run restaurant has some incredible food with some of the best service I've ever had. Their Clam Bake is incredible and I've never walked out of here hungry or unsatisfied. I wish more people took an approach like this to dining and feel like I'm part of the family every time I visit. You must try the calamari, stuff peppers, and definitely get one bottle of wine..."}
{"text":"Great Italian food in a small, laid back restaurant.  

I went in a large group, which allowed me to sample quite a few dishes.  Our group was loud and took up a good part of the restaurant, but I imagine that on a typical night it would be much quieter, but busy.   The bread was good and the bruschetta was amazing.  I was disappointed when the waitress told me that they ran out of bruschetta for the night.  I substituted my salad for the Italian wedding soup, which was also phenomenal.   I wished that I had a bowl instead of a cup.

The entrees were very good.  Not outstanding like the bruschetta and the soup, but definitely very tasty.  I ordered the veal parmesan and tried the piccata de vitello and liked both of them.  Then my table sampled many of the desserts on the menu.      I thought the tiramisu was average.  The cookies and cream and pistachio gelati, however, were great.  Both had a very smooth texture.

Overall you will have a very good experience coming to Aldo's.  Certainly on par with many of the restaurants located in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to serve a large number of people! It was surprising given that the place is so small. The food was excellent and service was spectacular. The owner made sure that everything was running smoothly."}
{"text":"If you are an Italian food fan and haven't been here yet, you are missing something special.  The fact Aldo put a little Italian restaurant in a tiny shopping strip mall in a nondescript SW suburb and it has not only succeeded but THRIVED for 30+ years speaks volumes as to just how special. Last night's dinner was a study in seafood/pasta perfection. 

It's our favorite Italian restaurant in the area, period. There are many that do a fine job but there's just one Aldo's. If you haven't been, GO."}
{"text":"Aldo's is truly a family restaurant where everyone knows everyone. It's not uncommon to be seated between tables of people who know the chef. The tiny restaurant offers a board of countless specials and if you don't see what you're looking for, just ask. They'll likely make it for you. The food is divine.   My favorite is the veal parmesan. Don't skip out on dessert. The tiramisu is great too! Good, traditional Italian cuisine. The service is phenomenal. You can't go wrong on a visit to Aldo's!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great.  Prices were a bit high.  Portions were small.  I found myself wanting more, but at least I got a free side of spaghetti with my meal.  The sauce wasn't terrific.  I'd eat the food again, but I wouldn't pay the price again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC pizza, better than any I've had in recent memory(sans deep dish, I don't care for deep dish pizza). The staff here is worthy of 6 stars, and as a bonus, our waitress is the cutest girl I've seen in Cleveland since I got here... lolololol #notkidding"}
{"text":"Aldo's lives up to the \"hype\"!

I was in Cleveland on business and a co-worker of mine who's from Cleveland said, \"You gotta get over to Aldo's and have dinner.  Tell him I sent you.\"  Now, I am a huge fan of the personal recommendation and if the restaurant owner and I have a mutual friend, going there to eat is a must.

This place is easy to find and easy to miss.  Tucked in the corner in a beat-up old strip mall, you might drive right by the first time.  It's pretty small, too, by today's standards.  I'm ballparking capacity to be around 40.  Some would call it intimate, and that's easy to understand once you've spent more than 10 minutes inside.

Sure enough, Aldo was there and he did indeed remember my friend.  I was shown to a table and offered bread, wine and personal recommendations for appetizers.  I had an eggplant and spinach app that was excellent.  For dinner, I went with \"old faithful\", spaghetti and meatballs.  Mama mia, it was delicious!  My wife (and my mother-in-law) make incredible meatballs from scratch and I dare say, Aldo's were on par.  I was told he comes in every morning to make them himself.  Hmmmm, maybe, maybe not, but it makes for a great story and the guy's been in business for 26 years.

This place isn't cheap but trust me, you won't care.  I spent over $50 for just me and left with a smile on my face (that was app, entree and wine, and I wasn't really trying to mind my wallet).

I will definitely DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Well after reading all the reviews and going to ALDO's I found myself very very disappointed! I thought I would be entering a into a great experience for Italian food but instead found myself with a friend in a swamp of YUCK and DISGUST!

All though the place was packed, our experience was nothing more than poor,  The place is very tiny , uncomfortable and you will be bumping elbows with the person next to you. My friend ordered Chicken piccata after the waitress insisted that there fine chef of many years was excellent the Chicken piccata was DRY, and tasted like a old tee shirt dipped in yellow puke. I ordered the Famous Lasagna (from what the waitress said) the sauce was good but he lasagna was paper thin with a little portion. Very disappointed!  stouffers has better boxed lasagna then this place has. The bread was excellent and so was the glass of wine, other that that its OVERPRICED and NOT good at all save your money and go somewhere else. Shameful for calling this real good Italian, Oh by the way saw lots of people eating dried out pieces of fish, the staff was friendly but that's it, the place was all so outdated. Terrible , will never go back.. If I could give it a BIG FAT Zero I would."}
{"text":"I can't believe how long Aldo's has been here and I've never been here! My dad drives for Uber and has picked up there a few times, so he suggested we try it.

WOW.
First impression is honestly not great. It's in a lackluster plaza, with a narrow entry way leading into a tiny dining room. Maybe 12 tables? Very crowded. 

The menu wasn't huge, but when you offer authentic, delicious food, you don't need a lot of options. There was a LOT on the specials board. It's clear that Aldo's specialty is seafood, which I will have to come back and try.

Our server was a doll. The staff was very attentive to our table and pleasant. A local, family owned place like this cant survive without top notch service and they obviously get that!

I ordered the house salad, which, the server made sound plain. \"It's just lettuce, cabbage and carrot\". I added the cheese and went with the house dressing. This was a lovely salad. Crisp mixed greens with all the fixings and an amazing dressing. It was like a shallot balsamic vinaigrette maybe? With the fresh baked bread, I could have made a meal of that.

I had a taste for chicken parmesan, which wasn't on the menu. Wait, what?
I told my waitress and she explained they can make one- it's not breaded and it comes in a casserole dish. (I think that's what's pictured in the Aldo's profile). This chicken parmesan was so good. Cheesy, saucy and hugely flavorful. I loved the baked chicken and of course the side of pasta.  

This was not a cheap meal, but I felt it was worth the price. It was a really good experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is truly hidden and had it not been for a recommendation from someone I trust I never would have gone in here and I live within biking distance of it. This place is rather small inside and when I was here it was completely full (reservations for 5+ only). The servers were very friendly and attentive and kept all seven of us happy and our water glasses no less than an inch empty. The food was really good. I ordered the muscles in marinara sauce and while it was the most simple muscle dish/broth I have ever had the muscles were the best. I was served no closed shells and they all came away from the shell very very easily if they were not already detached. All entrees are served with a side salad with good house dressing and pasta. I definitely will keep this place in mind to recommend to others or to get take away from. It is a really authentic place and feels so inside. The decor is no thrills but they keep the focus intensely on where it needs to be - the food. Also there are quite a few dinner specials which are on a dry erase board on the wall right in front of the door - take note of this on the way in because the waiter does not mention them to the entire table so if you don't read the board you will miss out on the specials. Note the photo here on Yelp (as of 21/7/12) is not what the sign currently looks like. Currently it is cursive script not on the rectangle backing."}
{"text":"We had 14 people in our party.  It's a small place.  They took our reservation anyways.  Kudos for this alone.  The wedding soup was phenomenal, and the pasta dishes were more than legit.  We made a lot of noise.  They just smiled and welcomed us to come back.  This is a pretty darn good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I only came for an appetizer, but got the mussels. They were awesome and came with warm bread. I ate the entire loaf! Classic local Italian place. Recommend."}
{"text":"Poor service, they don't even have all what they serve in the menu, you need to guess what they may have. Super pushy waiters."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service. I called to place a takeout order on a Monday not realizing the location was closed, but the proprietor was extremely helpful and offered to make the order for us anyways. Took extra care to make sure take out order had everything we needed and everything was very fresh. Pizza was just okay- crust was mediocre quality, but the spicy stuffed peppers and calamari were delicious! Would definitely frequent this place again and recommend to others in the area."}
