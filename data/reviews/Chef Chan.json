{"text":"Aways fresh, right, friendly, fast and accommodating. I've been ordering from Chef Chan for about 12 years and they have never gotten my order wrong.   This is a take out only and it just happens to be right beside the LCBO which is an added bonus. Order food, pick up wine to go with food, pick up food. They are almost always fast enough to have it ready when I return from the LCBO.   I've tried every Chinese food place in the area and I've always returned to Chef Chan, the others never compared favourably. I even had a Chinese friend point me to his favourite (authentic) chinese food spot in Unionville which didn't measure up to Chef Chan's freshness or friendlyness in my families opinion.   Our favourites are the fried noodle dishes, always generous on the meats and always consistently good with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Clipping nails behind the counter... Let me say I've been here many times, the food is good and I really hate to give a bad review of a Markham favorite but this is so not okay. Like who gave them a health and safety pass? Can't and won't go there again."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at many Chinese restaurants in and around Markham and Richmond Hill.  This place is definitely substandard as far as Chinese restaurants go.  Its a pickup only and they often get your order wrong!   My dear friend orders from this place and they often get the order wrong.     The food itself is acceptable but nothing to write home about.    I'd choose other places around Markham before coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent value, fast and tasty! Our go to chinese takeout while we lived in Markham and even after we moved to Maple - still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my favourite Chinese spot was actually closed so we decided to order from Chef Chan for a change. Unfortunately, it was not good at all. The food was very soggy and almost unbearable. This totally could've been due to delivery maybe it was sitting in the car for too long.. Not sure but I wouldn't order again. Out of the three items we ordered the chicken fried rice was the best."}
{"text":"The food is good at a reasonable price and definitely a quick to go in the markham area. The owner was very nice and kind. Glad i found this little gem"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chef Chan for over 15 years and it is definitely my favourite Chinese food restaurant.  The food is consistently good and in 15 years I think they've only gotten my order wrong in 1 or 2 occasions.  Their dinner for 1 combos are also very good value ($7 for fried rice, an egg roll, and a can of pop, and your choice of breaded shrimp, chicken balls, and a few others).  I used to live in Markham but moved to Stouffville.  I try to grab some Chef Chan whenever I'm in the area and sometimes find excuses to drive down."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Markham hands down! Tons of value big portions. Always fresh and they're always friendly. If you haven't gotten take out from this place you should."}
{"text":"Won't be doing business with a restaurant that clearly lies about their menu then claims no order exists.   I placed order and friend went to go pick it up. I Ordered 3 items and 2 of those items are suppose to have  egg roll and chicken fried rice. I called to complain the order didn't have this and was told no order existed and I was repeatedly called a liar. Not once did they ask for my name, my friends name or number. I gave them the info and they again called me a liar.   Really? Explain this to me? I also edited out my friends name and number."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Chef Chan since i moved into the area 10 yrs ago. The pricing is high for sub-par food. If you want to order a combo, forget about asking for an equal value substitution, they will charge you $2.00 or more for each substitution, with an argument of it being discounted as a combo. Even when i pointed out that the substitution had the same value or less. That's b.s.!! I can understand if i was switching my item in the combo for a more expensive item, but has not been the case. The food is ok, but there are much better places nearby to order from without any hassles. I also once found a fruit/food fly in the sweet & sour sauce for my chicken balls."}
{"text":"Great place that I'm sorry I discovered on my last day in town. Great fried wontons that actually have meat in them. Pork fried rice also delicious. Cooked perfectly and you can taste that they put the fire to it. Decent late hours also. Very good counter service.  Super reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Actually surprised so many ppl love this place. Its not horrid, but not great either.  Good items: Deep Fried Shrimp, Chicken Balls Decent items: Fried Rice Horrid items: Cantonese Chow mein (has no flavor, noodles aren't crispy), and Black pepper Beef (seems they add sugar to it), Egg Rolls (but I'm just not a fan of these).  We ended up throwing out half of our dishes. But to get all of that for $30 isn't too bad quantity wise, I just expected being in Markham for something tastier, like Congee Queen. LOL.  This place is hopping though!!! crazy busy...so its popular with lots of folks. I'm just not one of them."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh every single time! The best chinese takeout in Markham. Love all their dishes. ..especially sesame chicken, sweet and sour boneless pork, Cantonese noodles and so many more."}
{"text":"This is our go-to chinese food restaurant. My family and I have ordered here on numerous occasions for the past 5 years. It is a tiny hidden chinese take out gem, not for dining in, just a kitchen and a cash register and chefs who are very friendly and accommodating to fix your order the way you request (ie. making a dish spicy) . Our favourite dishes are cantonese chow main, beef fried rice, chicken balls which aren't too doughy and have decent sized chicken in them. We also are fans of the beef and broccoli which has tonnes of beef and vegetables! One of our favourite dishes here is the general tsao chicken which has a delicious flavour and a little spicy kick! I would definitely recommend trying this place, prices are low to moderate, portions are perfect for family and leftovers and the food is great in our opinion!"}
