{"text":"My Favorite Greek restaurant is back at a new location on O'connor dr. near St. clair. Same great food, great looking new location, very nice looking place, good job."}
{"text":"I ate here because it was the only place open on the Danforth after 2 a.m. on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. Everything else was shut down, which is the lamest part of this neighbourhood.  Since then, I've been here a few times (including a few visits in daylight).  It offers some of the cheapest food on the Danforth, and I think it's undiscovered. There are places down the street that have lineups out the door, but Zorba's is better."}
{"text":"Consistent eats and tasty options. All day breakfast til 4pm everyday a definite plus. Well priced and worth the choice every time!"}
{"text":"This used to be great place for authentic Greek food - Not anymore! Something has changed here (new ownership/management) .. whatever it was - the change wasn't to the better ... I ordered beef souvlaki as usual and was surprised that the waitress did NOT ask how i wanted my beef (rare, medium, done) ... we happened to be sitting very close to the kitchen area and I was able to observe what was going on there .... to my surprise I didn't see any beef souvlakis being prepared on the BBQ ... after making us wait wait for about 15-20 min i saw the \"chef\" taking a couple of beef souvlakis from the \"warming area\" at the front counter and then he added the sides  and as a final touch sprinkled some Greek marinade on the beef ...  then it took another 5 minutes for the food to arrive at the table !!!  needless to say that THE BEEF DID NOT TASTE FRESH at all ... it was probably been sitting there all afternoon !! in addition i prefer to have my beef cooked medium and not well done !   the bottom line: i'd rather get a box of frozen souvlakis from President's Choice than paying for \"Zorba's Home-Made Greek Food\""}
{"text":"Personally, I think this is one of the closest authentic Greek restaurants on the Danforth.  You have your typical Greek dishes from the grill and then there are the premade hot plate dishes.  You'll find oven-baked lima beans, Lamb fricase, Artichoke augolemono (egg lemon)  and things like tripe soup and mom's Greek meatball soup.  I've tried each and I wasn't disappointed at all.  It's as if my mom made them.  The place is a little divey inside, but really, you only come here for the food and not so much the experience.    I would recommend, definitely so.  A close comparison equally good is Filo at Pape and O'Connor"}
{"text":"I can only comment on what we got for 60 people for my mom's birthday over the easter wknd .  I picked up 50 chicken & 50 pork souvlakis cooked, greek salad, potatoes, rice, taziki (sp?\"), and bread.  Everything was cooked perfect, the sticks were not overdone nothing dry, the chicken was juicy and only white meat.  The pork had a beautiful spice on them and they had just finished them on the grill before my requested 1:30 pick up time.    The salad was loaded with tomatoes, olives, onions, cucumber and a tonne of feta cheese.  They had the dressing in a separate container for mixing later.  The rice was enough for 100 people and the potatoes were the regular greek fair  very tasty not dried out at all.   Nothing needed added salt or pepper the seasoning was perfect.  These guys came in on Saturday morning to do this for me and they are not even open for lunch.....I served it all up about an hour later and it really held up since it was made fresh and was still hot.    Total cost was $400.  added a cheese tray, pickles and a cake.....no headache......next time I'm going to add a medium size mousaka for the veggies in the crowd"}
{"text":"Very good value for this average breakfast.  (My 3 eggs, home fries, toast and coffee was under 6 bucks.)    Both my \"over easy\", and my friend's \"sunny side up\" eggs were a little undercooked.  The home fries were a tad over-cooked, with paprika aplenty.  I'm told the bacon was tasty.  The toast and coffee were typical diner fare.  The inclusion of a tiny Greek salad and orange slice were a nice addition."}
{"text":"Its what you can expect from a family run Greek restaurant. Good food. Decent prices, its a nice break from all the 'trendy' places on the Danforth sprouting up...  Spent much time in Athens/Thessaloniki...obviously the food in any restaurant in Toronto won't compare but its definitely NOT a waste of money to go here..."}
{"text":"I've lived by the Danforth for, pretty much, the most part of my life and Zorba's is just one of those mom and pop places that you never stop going to.   Again, I'm a big chicken-person, but whenever I'm at Zorba's, my go-to is the calamari dinner. Stacked with rice, potatoes, salad, and a LARGE heap of calamari, $15 goes a long way. The potatoes are made just the way I like them- Greek seasoning, a bit tart, and just so soft. The rice- well, it's Greek rice. Need I say more? The salad is good and it's served with a lemon and olive oil vinagrette. Simple, but tasty. As for the LARGE heap of calamari? Cooked to perfection! Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The calamari is rarely too rough to bite through.   I love this place and it just gives off that home-y feeling.   It's a good place to go if you want some cheap eats on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here last Saturday night. The place isn't fancy, but you feel like you're in a real true Greek family run place. For an appetizer we had Tirokafteri (Spicy Cheese Dip). It was amazing. the service was great  a wonderful waiter (quite cute too, always makes going to Greektown fun!).  We'd definitely go back anytime."}
{"text":"Don't go to Zorba's for the ambience or d√©cor. This is a place that keeps it simple. Delicious Greek food at a great price. I got (always get) the gyro dinner and was served the biggest pile of gyro I've ever been given. I've been in just about every Greek joint on the Danforth and Zorba's food is the best......maybe not the place to take a girl on a first date though, but awesome food"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a week day.  I was in the Danforth, so I was looking for a Greek place.  This was my first time here, and the owner/chef was behind the counter and working. When I enter a new place and have never been there, I let the cook tell me what is the best and to order that.  He had prepared a homemade greek soup that morning and told me I had no choice but to get it.   The soup was indeed delicious. If I closed my eyes, I could have sworn my grandfather made it.  You can't buy this stuff anywhere.  I bet it does not even have a recipe. It's just years of experience in a bowl of deliciousness.  Came with a huge hunk of greek bread and a diet coke.   9$ including tip."}
{"text":"Zorba's is what it is - good Greek food for a great price. If you want to skip the hustle and bustle in Greektown but still get some pretty good food on a budget definitely try Zorbas.  The place isn't ever packed and is served by one slightly grumpy Greek lady so its pretty great to bring some loud kids who run around cause there's never really that many other patrons to disturb.   I always opt for the dips as appetizers, they're pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"I do like old school restaurant...and this took me back to my student days in Montreal. It is not the 'prettiest, trendiest' restaurant on the Danforth but it offers the following features: A steam table with a variety of dishes  A comprehensive menu of Greek specialties  Patsa...the most amazing tripe soup  Great prices....about 40% less than the other establishments a bit west on the Danforth  Real homey old time family atmosphere.  The 3 of us shared a cold pikilia mix which featured tzaziki, taramasalata, eggplant salad, hummus, and cold marinated octopus (a plentiful amount). This came with about 3 pitas cut up in wedges, and there was no charge for additional bread.  The ladies both chose a souvlaki platter. Their platter come in Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large and range in price from $ 8.00 to $ 14.00. The main variable is the number of skewers you get...from 1 to 4. The plate piled on with rice and potatoes and greek salad.  I select, after the Patsa, a small greek salad and Lamb Shank from the steam table.  All the items were very good and the use of 'lube' (Extra virgin olive oil) was extremely generous.....  We ended the meal with a dessert. The ladies were set to share an order of Baklava, but on tasting it they found it stale. On reporting this to the staff on of the owner threw out the rest of the tray! What service and care for customers. I order the Greek yogurt with honey which was excellent.  The ladies finished up with Greek coffee which they both pronounced excellent.  Overall a trip back in time and good food.....This is not a restaurant for romance just basic good ole' Greek food.   We surely will be back."}
{"text":"As I ulived across the street for a year I basically tried the whole menu - any pork items lol...massive burgers, steak sandwhich they cut the steak right there from the loin ..u go often enough u get it extra thick ;) ... Fish & chips proper get the double..souvlaki dinner & gyros proper...great place check em out durin the taste of danforth for that quail lol"}
{"text":"I discovered this place years ago, because my sister lives just up the road.  The Danforth offers so many incredible Greek restaurants that the rather non-descript Zorba's is often overlooked by those not familiar with the area, and that's rather tragic.  Fact is, Zorba's offers excellent food for a lot cheaper than the more \"posh\" options further west.  I'd put their lamb souvlaki on par with Astoria easily, and it's a few bucks cheaper.  This trip, though, I had the lamb shanks that are on the steam table but not on the menu - they were absolutely incredible, falling off the bone/melt-in-your-mouth quality.  For the price, I doubt you could do any better.  Generally I'm there in with a big enough group that their group options are better go, though."}
{"text":"The place is run-down, but the food is good.   The dips are great.  The chicken souvlaki is always good.  If you're after quality food, but don't care so much in being in a fancy restaurant, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as great souvlaki? I haven't had it, if there is.  This is totally good though. I'd go back, but not before I try all the other places along the Danforth (it's a goal.)"}
{"text":"This place used to be fantastic. It is now permanently closed. For some reason Yelp wants to show it is still open. IT IS CLOSED AND GONE FOR GOOD."}
{"text":"It feels as though I've been on a bit of a Souvlaki bender, lately. Ah, well. No better place to do that than the Danforth, where my new job now allows me to pass through on a very regular basis. I figured I would start my new frequenting of the area with the very logical-seeming choice of Zorba's to fill my all-day empty stomach.  I never *ever* order this stuff on a pita, mostly cuz I want all the other trimmings that the name \"dinner\" implies (you know, salad and its carby friends). But today- not a whole lot of time (to sit or to get the food IN MY BELLY), so the hand-held option it was. I liked it a lot- really soft and fresh pita, and tasty chicken *smothered* in tzaziki...mmmm...I also could not resist the spinach pie in the window, and though I am \"saving it for later\", I had a taste and so far, so good. Slightly burned on the bottom, but   crispy (but not too crispy) and a pretty good size. Maybe an update will be in order when I am done...  *Oh, and I'll be sure to re-take that photo cuz I know I could have done better..."}
{"text":"I am being very generous when i give this place a 3 star...  its nostalgic for me as this place use to be popping back when i was in high school over 15 years ago.    But now this place is so runned down.  I came on a tuesday night... opening the door i was greeted by a snore from the cook who was all out asleep on the table.  i finally took a seat.  Not a single soul in the restaurant.  It was completely dead.  faint greek drama can be heard through their 8inch CRT tv's....  anyways, upon asking for my drink the lady (who also became the cook) served me a glass with LIPSTICK stains on it.  clearly noone even tried to clean it.. it looked like fresh lipstick stains.. please see the picture..this means they probably rinse the cups with water without ever scrubbing.  my knife also had a big fingerprint on it and my friend's pop had some black things around the rim of the coke can.     Why am i giving this place 3 stars still?  let me break it down...  1.5 star - for making me feel bad for them... its really sad to see this place at this state.  The lady was nice and you can see they are struggling.  just makes me feel sad for them 2 stars - for the food , still taste pretty good.  flame grilled chicken.. everything is finished off the grill for that char taste if you like.  -.5 stars - for really letting themselves go.. cleanliness is not priority here."}
{"text":"Zorbas used to have amazing Gyros but ever since the son stopped cooking there the food quality has gone downhill and serving size inconsistent. When the owner's son was working, the Gyros dinner would come with a heaping pile of hot Gyros; ordered the dinner tonight and there were a max. of 6-8 pieces of lukewarm Gyros. Not pleased and will not go again."}
