{"text":"I stopped by for an egg sandwich on a Wednesday morning. My server was unfriendly and gave off negative energy from the beginning. I waited, waited and waited for my sandwich to come out. I finally asked him how much longer (about 30 mins) and he was rude again, saying.....\"ummm I couldn't tell ya.. sorrrrry. He said it with no compassion and concern. I simply walked out the door telling another server... It shouldn't take over 30 minutes for one egg sandwich on a SLOW day. But honestly, It was this  mans tone and rudeness that will never  bring me back. It's too bad.  Way to many other places to eat that treat you with respect."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. Lots of variety and the food is fresh and delicious!  The restaurant is pretty large and they've done a great job in the renovation. I like the little things like how they leave you with a pot of coffee or a carafe of water and they have real maple syrup. Good service too!"}
{"text":"I had the Tri-fecta, which came with a single waffle, two eggs, and a single sausage link.     Good breakfast food, served pretty fast.  Once the food arrived, no one checked back on me.   It was busy, but I still think a server should come by to ask you how everything is and to refill your soda.  I also had to wait a bit after I was done for someone to come by with the check.  Better service and I would have given it 5 stars, I will try it again."}
{"text":"Great service; interesting and delicious menu; enjoyable ambiance. Kudos to server Gigi and manager Linda! We are from out-of-state, here to visit our daughter, and have eaten at this establishment 4 times in 8 days. To me, this represents a great recommendation. We'll definitely return the next time we visit Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"Just a word of caution, they do not quote wait times accurately. We're waiting for a table now and it's been twice as long as what they quoted, and we still don't have a table."}
{"text":"Great breakfast as always. Busy even for a Thursday morning. Wait staff very attentive."}
{"text":"So I'm going to preface this with the fact that I am one of the PICKIEST eaters in the entire world! But First Watch blew me away!!!! My server Carmen was just plain amazing, she made some awesome recommendations. I got The Works Omelete, which is a carnivore's dream, packed full with sausage, bacon and ham!!! Not wimpy little pieces of meat but big delicious pieces of choice meat! Not just left over bacon from the day before and  thrown in to cut on waste, fresh and crispy and obviously made for my meal!  As I said before, I'm picky. I don't like a lot veggies in my Omelete  so I got the mushrooms, no tomatoes, and light onion. Most places when you say light anything it's either completely gone or they just \"say\" it's light. This was perfection! It was enough onion to flavor it but not ruining the rest of the Omelete. Oh and did I mention that it PACKED with cheese as well!!!! Sooooooo good!! Like it blew my mind to the point that I actually ate every bite!  Now when they first brought it out I was confused because there was a side salad on my plate- and oh yeah have I forgot to tell you- I don't like rabbit food. But since the Omelete was so dang good I thought I'd at least try the salad. Boom they did it again, freakin awesome! I never would've even thought to put a salad with an Omelete, much less think it would delicious together!!!!! The dressing was super good, the lettuce was crisp and fresh and didn't taste like drive thru salads when you're forcing yourself to eat healthy. I actually WANTED to finish my salad because it was good, not out of guilt for feasting on a huge cheesy Omelete.  And oh my goodness the toast!!!! If I could live off the bread alone I would. It is thick, chocked full of grains and oats, and topped with an ample supply of butter.  Carmen also talked me in to getting something from their fresh juice bar. KALE TONIC IS TO DIE FOR!!! It was so refreshing! It DID NOT taste like it was fully of veggies, I absolutely loved it and ordered a large one to go before I left.  All in all it was the best breakfast experience I have had in a long time. I sat and drank coffee and read my book and chatted w the servers that would come to check on me. It was relaxing and fun! I also left feeling full and energized, not bogged down and groggy from feasting on a bunch of processed foods. I loved it all and it was the best way I've spent my morning all week! The staff was extremely nice, super helpful and you will definitely find me go there more often. Go go go you will not regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible it took my second visit to confirm that I will never visit this place again. It takes  15-20 minutes to be seated. they will seat people who come in behind you that are the same party size. The ladies in the front have bad attitudes and act like they don't want to be there. Once you're seated it takes at least ten minutes for your order to be taken and 20 minutes to get your food. On a scale of 1 to 10 the food is a solid 4. You get better food at ihop. April 10th 2016"}
{"text":"The last time I went to a First Watch has to be at least 10 years so I wasn't expecting much. Must say I was really pleasantly surprised. They have obviously rebranded during that time.  This new location had a fresh almost farm like feel with the wooden floors, outdoor seating and is very cheerful.  The menu was updated as well. Lots of healthy options including salad greens with my eggs which I love. They emphasize locally grown food.  Enjoyed the carrot cake pancake as well. The syrup came in a glass carafe and was warm. Nice touch!  Thought everything was fresh and good quality."}
{"text":"Even before we got through to door, I was impressed with the workers polite gesture of holding the door for us. Our server was very nice and responsive to our requests.  The dining area was spacious and modern with both booths and tables. The food was delicious and it had a very nice presentation!  I got the power wrap and subbed the turkey with some chicken and was delighted with the wrap. The house roasted Crimini mushrooms were simply amazing.  My friend got the winter seasonal A.M. Superfoods Bowl and even though she isn't a big fan of coconut milk or chia seeds, she really loved the bowl and couldn't stop tell us throughout the meal. My other friend got the avocado toast and it certainly came piled high with smashed avocado! Yum! I would highly recommend this place for a nice breakfast with friends or family and I even glanced at the lunch menu and was impressed with the options there too! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"i am not one to write a review unless the dining experience was outstanding or as in this case terrible. We arrived to a 1/3 full restaurant.  We were immediately sat. After about 5 min our server approached the table and introduced himself carrying a dirty pot of coffee not by the handle, but by the top with his on the spout.  I will not say anything about the silver dollar size hicky he was proudly sporting on his neck. He offered us coffee out of this dirty pot. I said yes to the coffee, but asked for a new pot and some water for the table. He returned to the table with another dirty pot, no water. We proceeded to order. I ordered a benedict, my wife an omelet. He took our order, but still no water.   While waiting for our meal I looked around the place at all the changes that were made. You would think a newly renovated restaurant would be cleaner. Out table as sticky to the touch, there were stains on the floors and the bathrooms we not the cleanest. After about 15 min our food arrived. My wife's looked ok, but the poached eggs on my benedict were almost raw.  Still haven't gotten any water. i looked to find our waiter to see if I could get a new set of eggs. He was over at another table bragging about the silver dollar on his neck. After flagging him down and asking to have the eggs redone over medium I watched him walk into the kitchen with my plate and utensils and ask for a re-fire eggs over medium well. He comes back to the table tells us it will be a few min. Is ask again for some water and he finally brings it to the table.   About 15 min later a different server brings my benedict back out without any potatoes and without any utensils to replace the ones that were taken. I ask for some potatoes and utensils, she says I will be right back and disappears into the back. About 4 min later my server comes out and asks how everything is. I again ask for potatoes and utensils. He runs into the back comes out with potatoes and proceeded to walk up to the host stand. Now there are 2 employees standing there and instead of running back to my table with some utensils my server proceeded to take a to go order. I notice the utensils are kept behind the host stand so I get up to get them myself. As I get to the host stand, my server says \"sorry dude\" and hands me a set of silver.  I head back to eat my rock hard poached eggs with cold hollandaise sauce and cold potatoes.   During the entire 45 min breakfast experience never once did a manager check on the table.  The servers we not proactive about anything, and a little too casual in their dealing with customers. Our food was cold and lacking flavor. I would also like to thank Kipp (aka Hicky Boy) for a crummy $30 experience."}
{"text":"My food was great, as it has been at all First Watch Restaurants. Highly Recommend!  The service at this location is absolutely HORRIBLE!  I will never go back here. It was as if the management purposefully did not train the staff on customer service and as I received poor service I watched the staff sit all together and each their shift meal while I waited to pay my bill.  I will most definitely go and eat at other locations but NEVER AGAIN at this location."}
{"text":"I love this place. All the employees are very nice and helpful. I eat here every weekend and do lunch a few times a week. You feel at home when dinning at First Watch."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes. After 45 minutes, there was still 10 parties ahead of us. Which would be fine except that the entire 45 minutes we waited, there were 5-6 empty tables that the hostess never filled. We saw several people ask about these tables, and the hostess just responded with, \"we'll call your name when we're ready.\"  We left.  I kept the app open after we left, and had we waited, the total wait would've been 1 hour 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Lots of workers, but no one to help you!  Food-only thing that was hot was my coffee.  Disappointed. Coffee was good!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place!   I took my mother here for breakfast on Thursday morning and it was delicious!   I'll be honest, I'm not a morning guy. I like tacos and tequila or burgers and beer! BUT even though no tequila was to be found, there was tacos!   Absolutely delicious! I've always had breakfast burritos, but never once crossed my mind that breakfast tacos could be so dang good!   Our waitress was Carley as well. The perfect amount of perky and smiles for a meal as good as the one I had! She did a wonderful job and even made sure our food was out within 10 minutes!   The manager also stopped by the table to make sure everything was going well too. He talked about fun things my mother and I could do while we were there in Scottsdale, so a big plus to the friendliness of this place!  Also Carley sold me on trying to Kale Tonic juice (this girl was magic, I tell ya). Was WAYYYY better than I was ever expecting! Very delicious even though the green will throw you off! But still very sweet like apple juice and good!    10/10 would recommend eating here for breakfast. The choices are all healthy and delicious, but the service was over the top. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We come here all the time for brunch. Excellent iced coffee and great juices that change all the time. I love their avocado toast."}
{"text":"Let's be honest and leave it at that.   This is not the Good Egg!. The decor is different. The menu is different and the food is different.  Please do not walk into this place and expect the Good Egg.  They don't want to be the Good Egg and in that, they are doing what I think is a great job.  I will say my meals are marginal and the taste is a little on the short side.  As a word of advise, if you want to get what you ordered then point to the item on the menu and have the waitress read it as I have never got what I ordered.  I should have had them take my picture as that would be the only way they will see me again."}
{"text":"The food and price are great! It's nothing flashy but if you're in for some traditional American breakfast fare, this is a good place. Just make sure to get there early or mark your name down because the line does get long.   The hosts are not the most friendly but the food makes up for it. We also got a nice waitress...so that helps too."}
{"text":"Always good. Always quick. Always warm and welcoming. Pecan chicken salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Good breakfasts! Monte Christo French Toast is fabulous. Clean, friendly place. Great service too. Healthy choices too for those who want those items. Lots of choices, unique and not always the usual items for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. When we walked in, we were greeted joyously by the host. We told our waiter, Alan, that it was our first time here and he pointed out the popular items on the menu. I ordered the breakfast scramble which was scrambled eggs with ham, spinach, cheese and HOLLANDAISE! over toast, served with FRESH fruit and home fries. It was a lot of food, it was delicious, and it was reasonably priced. My companion had the bacon hash browns with eggs and he loved it because it had a lot of bacon in it. Alan was an excellent waiter, he checked several times to see if we needed anything. The kitchen was quick with the food order. Also, I ordered tea and they served me a pot of hot water and a selection of Bigelow organic teas, so I did not have to ask for a second cup.    I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast. I appreciate their attention to detail, food quality and good service."}
{"text":"This place used to be somewhat decent but since it changed from Good Egg it is just bad. The food is bland, portions much smaller and it's pricier with a lower selection."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM. I'm from California and was with family back in December for a football game in Glendale. The morning of the game we stopped at the Denny's (or iHOP) by our hotel for breakfast. We befriended an elderly couple and asked about things to do and places to eat since we would be in town the next couple of days. Among their recommendations was this spot, First Watch.  The morning after the game we decided to check this place out. To our surprise we saw the same couple from Denny's (again, or iHOP) dining here. They assured us we would not be disappointed. Now, I don't remember the names of the items I ordered (a plate of bacon, a side of biscuits and gravy, and some chicken/egg/potato combo) but I do remember the taste. DELICIOUS. My Facebook post right after breakfast sums up what I thought: \"I'd move to Arizona just to be able to eat breakfast at this place every morning\"  If I am ever back in the area then I can assure you that I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for the weekend and stopped here for breakfast. Good food, good service, nice area. Very pleased."}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured out this way after we hiked Pinnacle Peak.  It is a great place to go after a hike cause they offer a variety of healthy options.  All of their stuff is made fresh and tastes that way too.  Only being here once I feel you cant go wrong with anything on their menu.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Would be 4 star. Had French toast monticristo which was pretty good. Called back to order it again and was told they never had that at this location. Even with it Clearly on this locations online menu."}
{"text":"So I had 2 bad experiences here, and after my last bad review the manager actually reached out to me to apologize for the service we had. Since then the service here has gotten 100% better!! This is our new favorite brunch stop, we walk with our dogs when we can. (Patio isn't dog friendly but we tie them up on the other side of the fence) they have amazing healthy food, so I have definitely changed my views on this place."}
{"text":"Nice healthy breakfast options. A few ingredient changes in the past two years that were not for the better, but the staff is absolutely AMAZING."}
{"text":"First time at this first watch location. Great service and excellent food.   Lots of healthy breakfast options!"}
{"text":"Food was great the wait staff was great but the manager Larry was the rudest manager of a restaurant I have come across in a long time. My son is autistic, he was on the best behavior that he was capable of... no screaming, no tantrums, no throwing food or running around other peoples tables. All he did was go between our table and restroom, which was adjacent to our table... You would have thought that he was the most disruptive kid this man has ever seen. He repeatedly came by our table to give us dirty looks and stares. I will NEVER RETURN to this First Watch as long as LARRY is still working there. If you have children with special needs stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this morning and it exceeded all ny expectations! I'm not usually the diner type, but the quality of food and commitment top great service will have me back here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love this place for Sunday morning brunch with my son, so many healthier options and what do you know? He goes for the giant sundae glass looking thing...turns out, it is healthy!! Yogurt, strawberries, bananas and granola!! He ate the entire thing and the waitress was super kid friendly, talking about Spiderman and what not. We were greated politely at the door and promptly seated. My food was awesome! Greek omelet, potatoes and an english muffin..just delish!"}
{"text":"What wonderful service!  My little independent 3 year old princess and I had brunch here this morning and it was a delight.  First, they gave us the perfect booth in the restaurant (I love it when someone has a toddler and the stick them in the middle of the joint....Sally & Bob do not want a 3 year old spilling their milk and screaming for chocolate cake)!!  Next, my spitfire ordered oj and it was \"too pulpy\" for her, so the waitress kindly said \"it's okay, I don't like all that pulpy stuff either\" and gave Sassy some apple juice (no charge)!  Third, I never once had to wait with squirmy pants!!  They were on top of our drinks, order & bill before I ever had to think about pulling a rabbit out of my hat for baby entertainment !!  FYI:  My precious girl is the most amazing child ever....she is just a ball of energy and likes it her way (she gets all that from her Pops)!!  Thank you for being so kind, having great food and of course for being \"aware\"!!!!  P.S.  Uffda, sorry to the booth of ladies to whom my Angel kept chatting with (that's from her Dad too....lol!)"}
{"text":"Was in area for business trip and ended up eating several time here. Every thing was fresh and well made. Even made it a point to go back special just to try their much and was not disappointed.."}
{"text":"Super cute new restaurant. Love the urban farm decor and the menu is packed with yummy breakfast options. The food is fresh and tasty and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Absolutley brilliant restaurant. I cannot believe I have never been here. They're menu is unique and healthy. They have a wide variety of options. I tried the avocado toast. It comes with two sunny side up eggs. And the toast is super thick multi grain.  The kind I make at home will no longer suffice lol. Will be returning every Sunday. Its kind of tucked away but totally worth checking out. Their fresh pressed juices are to die for and could even be used as a boost for any occasion. I liked the one with turmeric. Wonderful for my swollen pregnant legs. Lol. I tried a bite of my sisters quinoa power bowl and I literally broke into hormonal tears it tasted so flipping good. Best combination with quinoa I have ever had in my life. If i could give ten stars I would. I wish I could remember the waitress name but she was just lovely."}
{"text":"First Watch has been a favorite of mine since my college days in St. Louis. Now that my sister lives in Phoenix and I'm in LA its nothing to hop on the highway and take the peaceful drive to get my favorite treat. I'm trying to explore the menu more but I'm stuck on the trifecta!! One day it will happen. Also the juices are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love first watch! We would go every Saturday when I lived in St. Louis and when I moved to Los Angeles I looked to see where the nearest one was and well I made the drive just to get a little bit of home!!!!  I never need a menu! I always order the trifecta with a side of potatoes and a coffee!!! It's always on point and sometimes I add a little fruit!!   First watch is is always grade A!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The food is average and I'd rather just cook my eggs and toast at home. Save your money."}
{"text":"I love trying new restaurants and a friend suggested First Watch for lunch.  I had the Roast Beef & Havarti sandwich and the Honey Pecan Salad - fresh, flavorful and satisfying!  Love that they serve breakfast all day...I'll definitely go back to try that!  Service was friendly.  Great patio to enjoy the nice weather this time of year."}
{"text":"We love this First Watch location. The food is great! For breakfast we have tried and loved the biscuits and gravy, the chickichanga, and the avocado toast with basted eggs!! Service is friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the one in Robinson, no wait it's better cause it closer to me!!! The food is amazing and well priced and service was good. The coffee is why I go, it's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"First Watch has the best and freshest food around!  I love that I can order anything on their menu anytime of day.  Fast, friendly service with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever, cant believe they have Quinoa on the menu its so healthy. Love their friendly service. And best of all if you sign up for their Sunny Club which is free you totally get coupons and free B-day meals( just need your e-mail and name , coupons are send through your e-mail and print them its so easy) they even customized it with your name in it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was great. Clean establishment. Excellent food. Excellent server. I had a Belgian waffle, eggs, bacon and my dining partner had an omelet, potatoes and muffin. Nice touch the way a whole pot of coffee is placed on your table for under $3. We both ate for a little over $20. Good value. I will go again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while on vacation. The wait was short, the staff was very friendly, and the food was phenomenal. I had the Cobb salad, so good. Best cafe I've been to in a long time. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for breakfast for the first time the other day.  I was rather impressed that it was a healthy alternative to your average breakfast at Denny's or International House of Pancakes.  One of the first things I noticed when I walked in was that every table had their own pitcher of ice water ready for the customers to pour.  Don't get me wrong, while this was great since I was able to easily quench my thirst, I thought it was odd that for a state that's extremely conscious about water preservation, they could do this.  Fortunately I used some of the water our table couldn't finish by filling my empty water bottle.  ;b  Oh yeah, forgot to mention one really cool thing I like about this place is that when you get the check, it has the person's order and drinks AND tax summed up as Person 1, Person 2 , etc.  Plus a big lump sum at the bottom.  They really need to do that at ALL restaurants!!!  :D  Overall, the service was pleasant and prompt.  Unfortunately, I forgot the name of the tomato basil wrap dish I ordered, and while it was healthy delicious (tomato basil wrap, egg white, cheese, spinach, and smoked turkey... and side fruit), I was disappointed that the basil taste wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be.  My boyfriend also wasn't satisfied with his Chorizo Burrito.  So... 3 stars."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch the other day.  The parking is tight.  I walked into a very neat interior that gave off good vibes.  Service was fast and I ordered chicken rice soup and the Monterey club combo.  The soup was very much a chowder with no rice.  I asked the waitress if it was something else.  She checked with the kitchen and the manager brought me a new bowl, this time with rice in it.  I appreciated the offer.  It was good soup with or without the rice.  The sandwich was delicious and fresh tasting.  This is a great place to gather for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"This is probably the best cafe I've been to! As soon as I walk in, I'm greeted by one of the friendly employees! I got the avocado toast with an extra side of potatoes! The avocado was very fresh, the eggs were cooked to perfection, and the potatoes were seasoned well!  I have been to a few First Watch locations, but this is the best one by far. Justin was our server today and he was so friendly! The food comes out fast and hot, the place is clean, and everyone is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and come here regularly. They kept everything that was great about The Good Egg and made a bunch of things better! They updated the décor and added a few new items to the menu.  Good mix of sweet and savory items - hubbie likes the Quinoa Bowl and I enjoy the Fritatta. The lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing! Everyone is very attentive and so friendly.  Hope is always there to greet us and Jon,  Annie and Cindi are phenomenal servers.  Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick healthy breakfast. Went with colleagues after a meeting. Good service and well prepared food a plus. I ordered the egg white omelet and picked my own toppings- very tasty!!!!  My colleagues had not been previously been to here but were pleasantly pleased with the dining experience. My only rub was the bee \"visitors\" on the patio- they need to spray !!!!   While my calorie counting fanaticism consumed me- and I elected egg whites- I will definitely be having French toast my next go round- it was very appealing to the eye."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Top notch and love the variety. Will be back for sure. Our waiter was funny and down to earth."}
{"text":"Went to this location many times when it was The Good Egg.  Had the same experience with the eggs benedict and under-grilled potatoes coming out lukewarm and had to send it back.  It was explained to me that the dish is a bit colder since it has cold salmon and tomato. Sorry, this is unacceptable. We have been to at least a dozen other FW restaurants in Florida and not had this issue.  The other FW locations in the PHX area had similar issues.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have breakfast, brunch, or lunch. Although i have not tried lunch there yet. A step up from IHOP, Denny's, etc. Prices are good. Their meals, at least all the ones I have tried come with what an English muffin and what they call First Watch Potatoes. Crepes are good and is usually what I get. I think it's called Acapulco Express the one I get. The English muffin is nice and buttery. Their First Watch potatoes are always dry and flavorless. Every time I go there I am hoping they improve them but they are always the same. The staff is friendly and attentive most times."}
{"text":"First Watch is different than any other breakfast place in that it not only serves fabulous egg dishes, but the salads are unique and absolutely delicious! Quinoa and kale salad is to die for, as well as the chicken salad! I just wish this place served dessert ! But I am so thankful that I live so close to this restaurant !  Both my husband and I plan on returning again and again to sample everything on the menu... The staff is so friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is remarkably clean... It is a comforting place to dine!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast we had the avocado toast that was fantastic and the chickichanga was delicious. Friendly waitress who could actually make a recommendation when asked with timely service. We will be back to keep trying out this incredible menu!"}
{"text":"Good meal as always. I had poached eggs and salad Florentine style and shared my husband's multigrain blueberry, cranberry banana walnut pancake, all delicious. Good service, great coffee."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. Service and food is good.  I never took the time to write reviews on them so for 2015 I shall write!  It is bright, cheerful and nice to know the staff by name.  Country potatoes are not greased over, the cranberry nut pancake is almost as good as my homemade And the turkey sausage links are just like regular links-yum!  when you ask for egg whites or to remove butter they don't look at you like you have 3 heads."}
{"text":"We both had wonderful breakfasts on Wednesday, February 1.  We didn't have any expectations, it was recommended by one of our Foodie Friends...we always follow up on Tom's recommended places. FIRST WATCH, will see us again. It is a very short drive from Anthem.  We were greeted by Alexis with a smile,  at 7:22 AM, her service was over and above  what I am accustomed to in this area. The interior design is refreshing, open and casual.  By the way, we have waited for a replacement for the Good Egg for a few years, I believe FIRST WATCH may be it."}
{"text":"Unique breakfast menu and always changing it up. The remodel is nice and clean. Only off point is the turkey gravy over the biscuits was room temp.  It came out quick so sure not why it wasn't hot. Biscuits were perfectly soft and fluffy.   Iced coffee, side of bacon, and turkey biscuits and gravy was a splurge I enjoyed this morning."}
{"text":"The food wasn't impressive at all. I got the traditional breakfast and the only good thing about it was the eggs and the toast. The potatoes barely had any seasoning and the bacon was dry and overdone.   The service was good but for the price of the food I expected a little more."}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person, but I loved it here! It is nice and clean and there are plenty of healthy options. The juice is fresh squeezed and delicious plus they have a seasonal menu. You know the food is high quality and fresh. I opted for the avocado toast and my husband got the pumpkin pancakes. Both breakfasts were the perfect size and very tasty! We can't wait to go back and try other options. Also, it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"If you like food at all, don't come here. Ughh it was probably the worst restaurant I've been to with the exception of those off the highway stops. Seriously? This is getting rave reviews and customers? If you heat up an omelet from maybe 1 week ago it will taste better. This was bland, microwaved and just sad. If you want really boring tasteless food surrounded by senior citizens and no alcohol (??!! What? No Mimosas or Bloody Maries - how does that qualify as brunch?) then come here.    Being from out of town, I made the mistake of trying this place - brunch is meant to be delicious and a little bit fun to work off the hangover! This place is not that."}
{"text":"Amazing and cheap breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. You get your own personal coffee pot for your table. The service was outstanding! Our waitress was so sweet and even offered a to go cup for my coffee."}
{"text":"Was here on June 27 with a girlfriend. Restaurant formerly The Good Egg, now a First Watch. The interior is very cool, with a rustic vibe to it. The coffee was good, and they have different flavors of individual creamers at the table. I appreciated the thermal carafe of coffee.Our waitress was very nice and checked on us throughout our visit. We split the Bacado, I don't even remember any sour cream on it. It was okay. I could have definitely made it at home with much more flavor to it. I wanted to split the Eggs Benedict, but it did not appeal to my friend. Average experience. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It has a wonderful atmosphere! The staff is very nice and caring! I would come back every day if I could! They are also child friendly and offer greats items for children. The menu is nice and easy to read and they will answer any questions you have! I had a wonderful experience today and would highly recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Our server Cindi was friendly, caring, and efficient.  The host, Hope, was also caring and helpful.  The food was good, not great. We didn't expect gourmet for the price point, but an \"elevated egg sandwich\" should include an elevated bun, not an ordinary fast food chain white bread bun.  The egg sandwich ingredients had great flavor, the arugala was fresh, and the egg cooked to perfection. The other breakfast we ordered was a pumpkin pancake which was flat and undercooked, but was quickly replaced by Cindi. The second time around it was fluffy, moist, and tasty.  We like that real maple syrup was available (vs high fructose corn syrup Log Cabin) even at the additional cost of $1.29.  Portions could be more generous for the price.  The coffee was a pot so no waiting for refills. Filtered water versus chlorinated city water was really nice.  Overall, 3 stars."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for a quick and healthy lunch yesterday and decided on First Watch.  We have never been disappointed in this restaurant.  Good menu choices, fast and courteous service, great coffee always make this one of our first breakfast or lunch choices.  My only complaint is that the chairs at the tables are quite uncomfortable for me personally - we always try to get a booth!"}
{"text":"Always crowed on weekends which is good for them.i loved the ambiance Friendly wait staff, but I feel the food was just mediocre. We will give it another try"}
{"text":"I ordered the one blueberry pancake with an egg on the side.   It was exceptional.   Pancake, very large, light and fluffy but not thick.  The blueberries delicious and lots of them.  Warm real maple syrup.  My husband ordered the biscuit and Turkey sausage gravy with two eggs.  He kept taking bites of my pancake.  Liked his but loved mine.  Sausage gravy heavy on the sage flavor.  All in all we were very pleased with our breakfast and would go back again.  Coffee very good as well."}
{"text":"So scrumptious!!  I am not a big fan of breakfast spots, I feel like they disappoint, but not here! By far one of the best breakfasts I've had in I'm not sure how long!   Everyone is friendly as soon as you walk in, and my server was an utter delight. Angelica is a breath f fresh air so early in the morning. She always had a smile and was very kind to explain the menu. Most servers are in a rush and hate explaining, but not her. Her suggestions were wonderful and I couldn't be happier!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfasts last week, they had only been open for two weeks so they were still working out a few kinks but overall had a great experience there. The service was great, and our order came out quickly. The food we had was great, we chose a more southwest style meal but there was still the option for just eggs, pancakes or French toast. This is not The Good Egg anymore, which for me is an improvement since we stopped going there a few years ago when the service and food went downhill. It's definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients. Great service. I got the veggie frittata it was so delicious with melting goat cheese, a side of greens in a tasty dressing and a ginger drink on the side."}
{"text":"we used to go here every Sunday...but, something happened a few months ago and all of a sudden the wait staff turned over and the service just went to crap.  The Manager did buy us breakfast once and encouraged us to return...AND WE DID..then the stupidity just multiplied like bunnies and rats.  Food is good but the staff just does not seem to give a darn about you getting your drinks or food....  Don't waste your time Phoenix Downtowners.....go to Good Egg"}
{"text":"It was my first time in and not bad. Service was okay and the food was alright. I'm giving it a three since the party I was with agreed. It's a place to expect decent breakfast in Scottsdale. With all the places that do fresh foods and unique dishes, this one came up a little less than the rest. I don't think it's a place to rave about, but you get a hot meal and coffee that's priced right. If you want exciting, gourmet, or a true Scottsdale experience, dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tomato soup was good. Sandwhich was good however I wouldve like more pesto and less mayo so now I know for next time. Waitress knew when to check on us and when to leave us alone."}
{"text":"- Why go?  Make you feel like ur eating fresh healthy vs typical diner bkfst  - what I got? *Melon cooler - honeydew cucumber slight sweet refreshing wish had less ice more juice *smoked brisket hash - small 5 pieces of kale, and came out lukewarm which was disappointing . Good amt brisket, but not super tender, onions wished were more carmelized, and potatoes crispy outside good.  Overall ok  - come back?  Yes, will give it another shot"}
{"text":"We came at the busy time and we were seated right away. Our order was taken immediately. The food came quickly.  Great food. Great service. Very clean. Loved it. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love all the new decor and marketing images. Wish the food came close to the marketing hype. Have been to 3 locations and it's all the same. Hot breakfast dishes served cool, toast barely toasted and over buttered, eggs Benedict served stacked high on too small of a plate so that when you cut into it, it topples over onto the table, and did I mention it's served at room temperature? Suggestion: ditch the edgy plates and get some that can be kept and served warm so hot food stays hot for at least as long as it takes to be served to the customer. There's a lot more but I've run out of time."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous, the service is phenomenal, and the atmosphere is great. We'll be back weekly at least!"}
{"text":"Watching the game till there server switches the channel, asked her to switch it back they did. Then the manager came to our table and said we cussed at the server. Are you serious? Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING...worst omlet i ever had...and the potatoes were burnt... the service was good..i dont know how this place got any good reviews"}
{"text":"Ive been a FIrst Watch fan for years! Im so excited you are down the street from me again! You are always first rate with service and food, going there now!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service, asked waitress for additional hollandaise and she walked past me many times and never brought it. Eggs Benedict with raw bacon  inside. Overpriced. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem! Great decor and huge menu of fresh selections, all in a cool California vibe. Staff was all friendly and gracious, letting in my group of 7 people though they were closing in 20 minutes. I ordered the 2 For You lunch with butternut squash bisque and chicken avocado chop salad. Excellent all around. My entire group ordered variations of the 2 For You and everyone enjoyed their selections. Will definitely be looking for other locations of this great chain in my hometown. :)"}
{"text":"really great and quality food.  No garbage food here.  Great service as well.  Quality lunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"First watch offers everything anybody could ask for! They offer a nice juice bar if you are not in the mood for something to eat. They have healthy options for people on diets, which is great for me! They also offer great food like the Belgian waffles or the Traditional Breakfast. It features eggs, potatoes, a choice of sausage or bacon, and whole wheat toast with jelly. The staff there is experienced even though that it has recently opened. The interior is close to what a Panera Bread looks like. It provides a sense of comfort just like home! This is certainly the place for someone to have brunch if they're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the only reason I give 4 stars is because the service can be a little slow. I've typically gone on weekday mornings and I'm guessing this has mainly been due to spring training and the proximity to cubs stadium.    Now to thw food. The Lemon-blueberry quinoa pancakes are absolutely great and match well with one of their fresh juices or a cup of Joe.   The price is very very reasonable and the quality of food is awesome. I didn't realize that this was part of a chain with a few locations and will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"This place was so great we ate here two mornings in a row! Prices were very reasonable compared to breakfast prices in California! I ordered the avocado toast both mornings absolutely delicious! They also have a pear juice with cinnamon that's super yummy, how can it be healthy?!?!  I sure hope this place expands out of Az and comes to California --it would do well! If your looking for a delicious twist in traditional breakfast foods you must eat here!"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to First Watch in Cincinnati, OH and Northern KY for years and it was a pleasant suprise to find it out here in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  This location is fine, we get seated quickly and the food is good."}
{"text":"I go here every Saturday to eat breakfast,  i love the same things i get ever week , this place makes me leave with a smile on my face and my stomach feeling   oh so good , there french toast and waffles make me come back over and over again , the people who work there are really friendly and i just love this place ...food is really great. ."}
{"text":"High quality & very attentive.this breakfast eatery is well worth searching out.  Creative menu! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Food always solid!  New decor looks cool, but seating is uncomfortable.  I liked it better pre-remodel."}
{"text":"Nice calm atmosphere and very nice staff.  The fresh fruit crepes are some of the best I've tasted and the cup of Joe will get you hopin!"}
{"text":"What a great discovery to find right off of I 17. This was a much better choice than the neighboring restaurants that we thought we were going to try. Very fast and friendly and delicious. Good prices too"}
{"text":"This First watch location was recently converted over from Good Egg. We were regulars at Good Egg and always enjoyed their traditional breakfast menu items. We had been going to this location during the transition and were happy to see that the popular items were still being served with new menu items added.   Today we went and the menu was completely different. I wish the waitress would have let us know of the drastic change in menu items from the week before. The classic Eggs Benedict had tomato and was served on a cibata and included a side salad. I was not expecting this (I obviously did not read the menu close enough). The biscuits and gravy also did not have the traditional flavor and almost tasted canned. The scrambled eggs that came with it were barely scrambled together and did not have a nice flavor. My families orders were okay but we agreed nothing was good enough to come back to.   I am impressed with the new decor. It is very nice and modern inside. I wish that the food matched. We are sad that our long standing favorite breakfast spot went through such a drastic menu change."}
{"text":"Worst First Watch in Scottsdale. Lousy service. Server did little more than deliver food. Got the order wrong. 15 minutes of waiting for her attention to get check, gave up and went to counter to pay. Potatoes were cold and old. Won't ever return to this location. To management, this is the time and date stamp of our visit, in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"Ther place was packed, though I can't understand why. I ordered the turkey and avocado eggs benedict. The eggs were way undercooked, the turkey was extremely salty and there were only two tiny pieces of avocado. Hubby ordered The Works omelet. He said it tasted like one if those frozen omelets that you heat in the microwave. The potatoes that came with both dishes were also salty and undercooked. The kicker? When they asked how the food was and we told them, the only response was \"oh...sign your receipt here.\" With so many good breakfast places in the city, I will never come back to this one."}
{"text":"Great service from friendly, attentive staff.   Mediocre (at best) steel-cut oatmeal, saved by good strawberries and pecans. The lemon-poppyseed muffin I had was pretty good, too. But I wish the coffee we were served had been given as much attention as the staff gave us - it needed cream, and even then wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Never been happier to have found this place!  customer service so far has been awesome! they are always super nice and checking up on us to see if we are good. I would recommend this place to everyone ! You will not regret"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, First Watch is first rate with me. The thing I like about the place is you can get breakfast during lunch hours.  The food is always good. Max P. complained about having a side of potatoes with a sandwich, but I'm 100% Irish, which means I'll take a side of potatoes with Raisin Bran cereal if it was on the menu. The food is a wee bit pricey, but always fresh.  The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is ALWAYS clean. With the new light rail system, get off at the Central Avenue & Washington Street stop, and walk east on Washington to 1st Street. If you're driving, parking is a little tough (metered street parking only, so bring change)."}
{"text":"First Watch has delicious food, great service, friendly staff and nice environment. Try it, you'll like it! Kudos to Tina and Ian!"}
{"text":"Wow. What's happened to this First Watch?  We came in Sunday morning  at 11:00, and was put on a \"20 minute\" wait list. We counted 3 other groups( of 2 or 3) and 15 open tables( half of which appeared to have been cleaned).  When I inquired why the patrons were not  being seated, I was eventually told that 2 busboys called out. Yet, we watched waitresses/waiters standing around gazing at customers with no sense of urgency at all. It appeared no one wanted to clear & clean the tables. When a waiter QGgmyelled at the host to clean a table, the host angrily swiped food and paper onto the floor.   The irony was there were clean tables where customers could have been seated.  Perhaps those tables were not in the area of the idle waitresses, and thus, no concern to them.   Deplorable display of customer service, in any case. In my youth, I worked in restaurants. When shorthanded, we sucked it up and did whatever had to be done. Here, it appears no one is willing to go beyond their job description. Management should take notice."}
{"text":"By far the very best pancakes hands down!!! WHEAT GERM pancakes taste like pancakes should've tasted since the beginning of time!!! The complete staff are welcoming and appreciative from the very pleasant manager to the waitresses and cleaning crew! Always a great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"This is a clean airy restaurant with healthy food choices. It has a family style environment with reasonable prices. Good place to go if you have dietary priorities."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm really sick of the faux local cafes. We won't be back. The food is overpriced for the quality, my omelet had about three sprinkles of chorizo , and the potatoes were uninteresting. Coffee is cheaper at Starbucks. Upsides- Our waitress was very good and the millionaire's bacon was tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come every weekend since you opened. Normally it's decent but this last visit was a total disaster! You sent out these mailings and were definitely not prepared for it! People that sat after us were served immediately and left 20 minutes before us... it took 15 minutes of us sitting before we even had a server... then our drinks took forever to come and it was like our server forgot about us... then we order and she tells me she thinks they're out of one of the breads.... so she brings out my meal and some pancakes that we never even ordered! So they took it back while I ate alone and my husbands finally came out when I was done! Waitress showed no remorse and we were beyond irritated while walking out! Then I go to cash out and the lady asked everyone else how their experience was except for us.... then I tell her and she shrugs... fantastic!  Ruined our Saturday morning as we then left grumpy and obviously that set the course for the rest of our day!  Won't be back now for a while til the nonsense if figured out! I'm totally disappointed because I was enjoying going out to breakfast every weekend and this ruined it for me!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast place in town. I love fresh juice to avocado toast. It's a healthy breakfast place. Portion size is perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"this place is great -- breakfast is fast and hot and (best of all) wholesome!!!   the potatoes are baked, not fried and they are always accommodating if you don't want meat or extra this or that, no problem!   and I am always greeted by the happy, smiling faces of the friendly staff!   sometimes the service has been slow because they are training new staffers, but if they don't meet their high standards of fast and friendly they're great about letting those people go so the rest of the team isn't taken down.   I love this location! keep doing an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"First Watch is a successful chain restaurant that specializes in breakfast and brunch. Having been to First Watch restaurants in the Midwest, I thought I would try the new restaurant off Camelback road in the Biltmore/Arcadia district. First off the decor is very pleasing and upscale compared to traditional FW restaurants which historically appear more country casual (nicer than but similar in color genes as the IHOP). This FW maybe the nicest I have seen. Expecting the solid but straight forward food of old, FW has picked up its game. The steel cut oatmeal was well presented with fruits and even herbs added. It came with a nice muffin. The pancake was perfectly made and tasty but was not unique (I prefer the untraditional thicker ones with the fruits cooked inside. No complaints with his pancake though. The juices have expanded from ordinary bottled OJ to option of Kale or carrot/ginger infused drinks. I had the latter which was as good as a juice bar. Service was friendly and abundant though my polite server was maybe the least of the attentive of those that I saw. While the inside is nice, I would have liked outside seating option that is lightly covered. There's was encased in concrete with openings. Makes it somewhat dark. In conclusion definitely worth going. It is not a risky proposition and the price is chain right. Good game pickup FW."}
{"text":"Fun industrial farm decor, wonderful menu selections, super nice staff, delicious food, easy with kids... Perfect for our family! So glad we stopped for breakfast! Kids had fluffy pancakes and we had brisket, kale, hash with eggs and maple BBQ sauce... Yum!"}
{"text":"Came to First Watch after a bad experience with The good egg. 1000x better. Unlike other places, the food isn't greasy and doesn't give me a stomach ache afterwards. Lots of options and you can order breakfast or lunch any time of the day!  Our waitress told us: \"If we can do it,  we will\". She even let us order the Turkey Dill Crepegg even though it's not on the menu any more.  I will keep coming here! I recommend it any day. I'm just bummed they close at 2 30 :("}
{"text":"Are you sick of fighting for tiny bistro table at Starbucks to operate out of? Then switch to First Watch for a terrific spot for long leisurely working breakfast-lunch.    While the coffee isn't quite Starbucks quality, it's definitely a cut above average and most importantly it ain't at Starbucks prices either...and with endless refills to boot.  Also you can get solidly good breakfast food (especially if, like me, you're a fan of biscuits & gravy) as well as decent selection of sandwiches & salad for lunch.  3-star food plus 1 extra star for above average bottomless coffee & newspaper as well as healthy options for those days when you may feel like cutting down on grease."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious and nutritious. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place just across the parking lot from our hotel."}
{"text":"First Watch is a great place to go solo, as a couple, or to take your family to for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. This place is so cute and the food is delicious. Especially the bacon and potatoes- they are my favorite! Always great and friendly service! Kipp is the best server I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The service was fine but the food taste like it has all been frozen and reheated. This includes the hash browns and the bagels. I do not think I will return"}
{"text":"Must try.  Nice place to enjoy breakast. Great addition to neighborhood. Friendly staff. Great breakfast ."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast this morning with my mother. The place looked clean, it was nice and open. When we left, I was surprised that there were so many people there (I was facing away from the bulk of the place), because it was pretty quiet.   The service was good. Our server was pleasant and attentive, and the other people that worked there seemed nice. Someone who I think was a manager was helping out and seemed to be very nice to the employees, which was nice to see.  The food was okay. I had a blueberry pancake with scrambled eggs and a sausage link (emphasize... a single sausage link). My mom had the breakfast scramble, which was hash browns, some fruit, scrambled eggs with veggies scrambled in on top of toast. Both of our meals were decent. They were nothing special, and at least for mine the portions seemed a little smaller than similar diners (again... just one sausage link? I'd expected to get 2 or 3), but I still wasn't able to finish the pancake. The fruit that came with my mom's meal also seemed like a pretty small portion. I tasted her hashbrowns, and I liked them. She thought they were a little too salty, though.  Something that I really liked was that they left a pot of coffee and pitcher of water on the table for us. I imagine that when it gets busy (we were there on a Tuesday morning, so it wasn't busy), that helps a lot with servers being able to bring food, clear plates, etc, without having to worry as much about refilling drinks. In the little bowl of coffee creamer, they also had flavored! They had hazelnut, vanilla, and just regular creamer.   Overall, it was a nice enough meal. I wasn't crazy about the food and given the amount of breakfast places close by, I probably won't go out of my way to go again. If I'm with someone who wants to go, I won't complain!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Bacado breakfast sandwich ... an excellent and tasty choice. Service was very good ... friendly waitress. Would give this restaurant 5 stars but for one thing ... hard to ignore the televsion screen tuned to FOX \"news\". Really?  What's the message with choosing that as the broadcast?  For my sister & I --- an insulting and offensive atmosphere. Would hope the manager would realize there are better, more \"balanced\" choices; If customers want a news station, put one on."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding meal today, and the service was really great (thank you Travis for your suggestions and for taking such good care of us!!). I had the Chickichanga - a breakfast burrito with chorizo, spiced chicken, avocado, onion, cheese, with verde sauce and sour cream. Delicious! It came with a small cup of fresh fruit and some fried potatoes, also yummy. My husband had the BLTE (a BLT with a fried egg) which was huge and delicious. Crispy bacon, fresh bread and greens, and homemade chicken noodle soup. My son had the Trifecta - with French toast instead of waffle even though it's not on the menu. He says thumbs up! My mom also had the Trifecta and says the bacon was perfect, the French toast was great, and the scrambled eggs were also quite good.  We recommend this place and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times recently.   On both occasions I was acknowledged and seated quickly.  The menu was filled with other than usual fare for breakfast.    The service was very prompt.  The food was prepared and presented quickly. The flavor Of both meals orders was very tasty.    My only feedback was I was not asked what type of bread I wanted or if I did or didn't want home fries    I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"It's great for what it is - an easy and inexpensive breakfast spot. I normally come once a week and I've never had a bad meal nor bad service here. Will definitely continue to frequent FW!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, the service was very good, but the food was over salted and over priced.   I'm surprised other reviews mentioned the massive quantities of fresh fruit.  I got a tiny cup with some not ripe melon pieces.   This is my third trip to a First Watch (Westlake and the Heights) and the food just isn't very good."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite breakfast place. I love the food, atmosphere and the coffee! Everything that I've tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, excellent food & clean restaurant. Waitresses was very knowledgeable and accommodating for those in my party with dietary needs (gluten free, vegan and low sodium). The one thing that I thought could use a small tweak was their breakfast potatoes, they were heavily salted. Could of been a fluke that day, but aside from that we all had a wonderful brunch."}
{"text":"We just finished our brunch at First Watch and we will definitely be back. My husband had the Forager Omlette (which I tasted) and it was delicious. I had the traditional breakfast. The potatoes were well seasoned and tasty, there was enough bacon to share with my husband and get my fill, and the raspberry spread was the best I've ever tasted. We found our new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and the food was really delicious, though a bit pricey. The manager Rachael met us with a smile. She was so very nice and friendly. It used to be the Good Egg and we had stopped going because the food wasn't as good as it used to be.  So we were happy to give First Watch a try.  The place is so much nicer than the Good Egg's décor. Our server sorry don't remember her name was great."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast meeting there this morning.  The decent service is all that gained the second star, even though my party's food did not come out at the same time.  I ordered the Cherry Chicken Quinoa Power Bowl.  It was gross.  They served me leftovers.  The quinoa was not made that morning, nor was the chicken.  The assembled and reheated leftovers.  Awful.  I think the dish was balanced and inventive and had it been made from fresh food, it would have been very tasty.  Still, for a place that boast farm fresh, the food they served was a joke.  I wish I would have ordered something with eggs, so it would have been somewhat fresh.  If I have to meet someone there I'll try it again, but I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast , outstanding for lunch. The salads are grrrreat! The wait staff as been there for a long time and they are consistently A+"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and finally went this past Saturday morning.  Is is very nice inside and the menu was good.  Ordered coffee to start.  When my wife opened her pack of silverware, she notice that her spoon had dried food on it (guacamole I assume since it was green).  The waitress apologized and brought a new set.  Then I looked at my spoon which I had already stirred my coffee with.  Same thing!  Then our food came, looked great!  Mine came with another spoon.  Dried food on back of spoon.  3 for 3 on the dirty spoons.  My wife went to use her knife - take a guess.  After complaining to the waitress, the manager knelt by our table and apologized (dissing the cleaning staff) and comped our meals.  But as I ate, I started to think about how clean the utensils were that prepared my food and couldn't continue eating.  Left the waitress a $10 tip but even she should have seen the dirty spoon that was put on my plate with my meal.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food and service are great. Atmosphere is nice rustic chic. This restaurant deserves more stars. Definitely get fresh squeezed juice!"}
{"text":"Took my  BF there for Sunday brunch this weekend. We were seated in less than 10 minutes despite it being very busy. Our waitress was efficient and cheerful. We both loved our meals. He had one of their pancake breakfasts, and I had the egg crepe with turkey and avo.  I love the egg crepe. If you are familiar with the Hobees restaurants in the SF Bay Area, this is probably as close as you will find to Hobees, but with a better menu selection.  They do indeed give you a whole pot o coffee, which they even refilled for us. Although it was bustling, we did not feel rushed and were able to linger over a 3rd cup. My BF loved their coffee, but I found it a bit weak for my taste. Would love if they offerred a darker roast. But all-in-all it is a great value. We will be back! PS: this is a family atmosphere, so there are kids of all ages, and all that implies."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast place I have ever been to!  So many healthy and delicious options!!  Clean, adorable place! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I very seldom do negative reviews, but today I feel this is necessary to help this business get it together. On Sunday mornings between 10 am- 12 noon, you expect that wherever you choose to enjoy breakfast there will be waiting involved- sometimes a lot of waiting. And sometimes, you get passed over. For us, it's more about how the situation is \"handled\" or resolved. This is my third visit to this location, and unfortunately our last. Every time I've been here, there seems to be a disconnect between the front of the house and the kitchen. This time, it was the host, he seemed overwhelmed and not organized. I think he either lost or deleted our name on the list, because after we had waited for 20 minutes, I checked and he seemed flustered and I don't think he found our name on the list. A few weeks ago, we visited the First Watch in Scottsdale and had an amazing experience, and they were just as busy, and yes we had to wait, but it was a short wait even though I believe the restaurant itself was slightly smaller. Good example of how the right management team can make all the difference! Good luck to the First Watch on Ray Rd., hope you're able to overcome the challenges you've had."}
{"text":"Ripp off,  no prices on Manu (was told because the prices change frequently). Ordered Muesli, not a true muesli,  no shredded apples,  it was yogurt,  oats,  shredded almonds,  and dried up raisins and craisins,  paid $6 this time,  never again"}
{"text":"Had brunch there that included the Avocado toast and waffle.   The Avocado came with some plastic string mixed in but the toast was thickly cut and perfectly toasted. Came with a side of eggs that were on the small side but enjoyed.   The guest had a waffle and side of bacon. They enjoyed every bite and would get it again the next time.  Service was prompt and there was plenty of room between tables so you didn't feel squeezed in.   Only because the plastic did the rating drop."}
{"text":"From such a good experience the first time this second visit was a complete flop. We walked in at 10:45 to a full waiting room and a hostess telling us it would be at least 20 minutes to being seated. Looking around we saw three empty tables in one area two in another and what looked to be a three empty in another area. We then asked if we could be seated on the patio as there was only one occupied table out there that we could see. We were informed it wasn't a good idea as it would be a long wait to get service. What's happened to this place, bad management,bad help ? To have enjoyed the food and service enough to go back again and after a wait just getting up and walking out if I was the manager I'd be ashamed that my customers were treated this way."}
{"text":"First Watch in Chandler. Waited 40 minutes for our meals. Several tables seated after us were served before us. Waitress stopped twice to apologize for the delay. Not her fault. Photos show generous portions. I was served one 4-5 inch pancake, two small fried eggs  and a mini sausage on a huge platter. $10.00. Very disappointing. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go to favorites. This visit the food service was bad. It took an half hour to get our food. I had the barbacoa egg benedict special. The eggs were over cooked. We would have been better off going to a house of pancakes or Waffle House."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and stopped by for breakfast. The service was excellent. And the food came out quick. We loved it! I had the BLT eggs benedict and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service Creative menu Healthy choices"}
{"text":"This place is good, but very ordnary, nothing special, nothing stands out about it, they use pace salsa!!! The service was ok, but 2 min after we got out meal, the waiter asked if everything was ok, and dropped our check!!! I thought this was very tacky, he was not busy, and we were being rushed out!! We will not be going back, what's the point.. We can get as good, and alot better food, with better service elsewhere"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, and we were seated right away.  I had the crepe with fruit, yogurt and granola, and yum-O!  It was fantastic.  Also - homemade muffin was really good.  I was too full to eat it in the same sitting, so I saved it for later, and it was great!  My friend wanted regular eggs benedict (ie, english muffin, ham, egg and sauce), and specified that when he ordered, but he still got more stuff on it (I think it was a tomato or spinach or something).  Overall, not a huge deal, because it was easy to scrape it off, but minus one star for that."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. The food was fresh and the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food! I miss the old salad that came with sandwiches- the one now is pretty boring, just lettuce and some dressing. I like they have \"chalk board\" specials so there is always something new to try that's not on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Had brunch here last Sunday after church.  Loved the menu choices. Something for everyone. Kids had blueberry pancakes and LOVED them. Be warned - they are enormous. Link sausage and bacon were both good.  It's nice that they leave the pot of coffee on the table with flavored creamers, as well as a pitcher of water with lemons.  I had fruit filled crepes with a muffin and it was deelish! Service was great and it was really nice to then go \"walk off \" our meal at beautiful Crocker Park. We will go back soon and check out additional menu offerings."}
{"text":"Good food, expedient service, good surroundings. All the stuff you look for in a breakfast place. Even with a good pile of people waiting outside, our wait was only quoted as 15-20 minutes, and I am sure we waited less than that. Order taking and food came in fairly quick succession, and the presentation was very good - plenty of classics on the menu, but made up a little bit differently. For example, I had the sockeye salmon eggs Benedict, which were served on ciabatta rather than English muffin. Very good. My man had the oatmeal, and I would bet the fruit on top had been just cut and just for that order. Check arrived before we even started looking for it, and we paid without delay. These mornings are rare when traveling. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people would give this place anything less than a perfect rating. If you are looking for a nice breakfast or brunch spot, why go anywhere else. I've been 4 times and every time the food is delicious. The ingredients are natural. One of the best breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"Slight step up from Denny's. Take it or leave it. Just don't come with high expectations. Omelet was ok, potatoes were under cooked and coffee was meh. Wife's skillet had a large black hair-she's blond."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options from healthily to your more traditional style. The in house made granola was tasty and staff very friendly. I went alone and sat right away but it looked like larger groups had to wait a little, I say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Spoke to two servers an hour before our 11 year old girls soccer team was going to go there for a post game brunch.  Both were wonderful and excited that we called ahead.  When I spoke to the owner/manager John, he made it clear that they didn't really want our business.  Said it was going to be crowded in an hour and we would be better off not coming.  We took his advice and went to Over Easy.  Fantastic place with great service and a very nice menu!  Thanks John."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped for the night in Westlake while roadtripping to Pittsburgh. After searching the internet for the best local place to have breakfast on our way out of town, First Watch seemed to be it.    We were seated in the back of the restaurant next to a very large group comprised of several small children. I would get this if the restaurant was completely packed, but it wasn't. I could barely hear my friend across the table over the other group's noise, but OK.    I had the Monte Cristo. It was good and filling, but it seemed to be lacking the dijonnaise or anything to make it particularly moist. I opted for the dressed greens as a side. While I was happy to have them as an option, the bottom greens were a little too \"over\" dressed and I could not finish them.  This restaurant fulfilled our needs of the morning (and DID provide us with our own individual carafe of coffee -- much appreciated), but it was just OK for me."}
{"text":"I always give places a second chance. This doesn't deserve a third.  First time, I ordered a hot sandwich. It came out with bread so smooshed it was as thin as a tortilla, and the meat on the inside was cold (refrigerator cold).  I figured it was a breakfast place, so I came back and ordered crepes. Tasteless crepes."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I enjoyed my visit and plan on returning soon. Decor is very modern and has a nice rustic feel. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I gave 1 star because there isnt a zero star. The veggie omelet had broccoli and onions that were so chewy they had to be microwave, the tomatoes were a color I had never seen, probably reheated in a micro too. It said it had goat cheese, there couldnt have been over a teaspoon of it in the entire omelet. The service was horrible, the server saw my empty drink as I was half way done with my meal and she just walked away. I had to call her back to get a refill (they didnt provide water) She forgot my toast, after telling me it came with it. Then she left to eat her meal, never to come check back. The server took the order of a woman next to me before going to lunch, probably 20 minutes later someone came out of the kitchen to find why nobody came to get her meal. As I went to pay the bill 2 employees were chatting as I stood there for a while, then the guy reached out his hand with out saying a word, he gave me my change and never asked how things were, he probably didnt want to hear it. Food was a bit expensive, horrible and the service was even worse. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fairly decent. I had the lunch here with my supervisors as company's treat. I loved the place."}
{"text":"We just left First Watch and we are feeling good! We started off with Morning Meditation as our drink of choice. It was quite refreshing! I had the \"Chickichanga\" which was AMAZING. The chicken, chorizo, green chilies, and eggs were all cooked to perfection. They hooked it up wth the avocado inside the Chickichanga! At first, I was a LITTLE skeptical about the \"Vera Cruz\" sauce that they topped it with but I went for it and geeze! I'm happy I didn't change my mind. Plus, the sour cream on it was a perfect addition. It came with a side of seasoned potatoes (which were not dry at ALL) and fresh fruit as well. My honey got the \"Frittata Rustica\" and although at first he wasn't too happy with the size of the omelette he later admitted that it was the perfect portion. It didn't look like your \"traditional\" omelette but the presentation was beautiful and the taste just as great. We ended our meal with a freshly Baked Muffin of the Day which was: chocolate chip. Sooooo delicious! Our waiter was so attentive and kind. Our muffin ended up being on the house since he said our food took \"a little longer than usual\". :) Overall, our experience here was worth a two thumbs up. We will definitely be coming back here when we visit again. Our friends will also be hearing about this place!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty disappointing experience here; we will not be returning. EVER.  The only positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt and attentive. The food, however, was horrible. I can't understand all of these relatively glowing reviews about the meals here. I had some sort of biscuits and gravy breakfast with sausage (can't remember what it was called). Everything was dry, tasteless, and inundated with onion. I have never had a sausage gravy with SO MUCH ONION taste before and it was nauseating. In addition, my husband had a Belgian waffle with sausage; he said the waffle tasted like \"sawdust\" and the sausage was burned.  We should have complained to our waitress, but we were feeling lazy that day, I guess. Shame on us! Anyway, we picked at our food for a bit and left pretty unhappy. Like I said, we will not be returning for a \"second chance\" at First Watch."}
{"text":"My new number one breakfast spot , chicken omelette amazing! By far best breakfast in Arrowhead"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see that there was a new breakfast place being built down the road from where I live. Sadly I was let down, I've eaten there twice now. One dining in and second was take out. The food tastes good but it may fill up a 2year old. It got even worse when I got take out to eat at home, when I got home I was very excited to eat my hash browns and when I opened the box I thought it was a joke. Maybe 1oz or 1/2cup of hash browns in there. Very disappointing, will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"We reviewed this First Watch location before and said we ate breakfast there twice, and the food was very good, but cold both times.  We went there for a third time recently and told the waiter the food had been cold on two prior visits. He explained it is corporate policy not to use heat lamps, so that apparently is the problem. He did make sure our food was warm this time, but we noticed it did not stay warm very long. Maybe the plates should be warmed ahead of time?"}
{"text":"I have been a customer there for a while.  I have never been disappointed in their service. The food is exceptional.    When you get there to eat, ask for Liz.  She will make sure your experience is a good one."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to First Watch when I'm in the mood for  a relaxed, easy-going experience for breakfast.  I always get in quickly and we get service quickly.  Plenty of space in the restaurant - bright and airy. The menu is perfect for breakfast.  Lots of healthy options.   Omelets are tasty. Love the french toast and pancakes too."}
{"text":"I went home to Cleveland to visit family and friends and was pleasantly surprised to see all the new restaurants thriving in my home town.  My Aunt organized brunch for the family at this nice little restaurant.  They are open from 7 am til about 2 or 3 pm.  My mom was not as impressed as I was, but the food was very fresh and the portions were generous.  The prices were not too much and they happily accommodated a large party such as ours including kids.  I am happy to say that there were plenty of options for everyone including diabetic family members."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch place since I lived in Palo Alto in the 1980s. Different types of dishes.  WHOLE GRAINS,which I love.  Great service.  Not cheap, but worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast in north Phoenix! Try the French toast- to die for Definately worth the wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in first watch and nursing a diet coke that hasn't been refilled in 50 minutes.  Food just came out after the aforementioned 50 minute wait and it was cold.  Had to send it back   This is the second time I've had extensive waits for service and was served cold breakfast in a month. I really want to like this place, but they won't let me. Save yourself the aggrivation and drive right on past First Watch if your looking for a good brunch spot."}
{"text":"Very non-traditional and creative menu items. First Watch bought out and took over all of the old Good Egg locations. My son had the breakfast sandwich and loved it. I had the Italian sausage and cimini mushroom potato skillet, which was very good. Terrific jam with the fresh, thick rye toast. Overall a great meal with lots of options to break out of the traditional breakfast menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast.  He had Farmhouse Hash and I had Eggs Benadict. Neither of us were impressed.  His hash was just ok tasting but was on the small side for a man. I had Eggs Benadict. The whites of the poached eggs were runny, the hollandaise was bland and it was served with a handful of greens with no dressing on a plate that was too small. But it did have a lot of ham. I'll go elsewhere for breakfast but will give lunch a try at First Watch. Decor was fantastic and service was great."}
{"text":"In a neighborhood with lots of breakfast eateries, this is the best. I had their farmers omelet and it was stuff full of veggies and goat cheese. My husband had the biscuits and gravy _ some of the best Ive tasted"}
{"text":"We ate at this location for the first time on New Years Day when it was still the Good Egg. It was so good so we came back the following weekend to find that it was now First Watch. Initially disappointed we stayed for breakfast and have returned many times since! I love everything about this place -- friendly staff, cute decor and EGG-cellent food! :) We've even taken out of town guests and they enjoyed it just as much. My go-to is the veggie market skillet (to die for!) but I had a waffle this morning and it was delicious! We've tried other FW locations but this is my favorite :) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Acapulco Express omelette: chorizo, avocado, green chilies. English muffin not toasted, hash browns not seasoned, omelette flat. Coffee was spectacular, however."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning. Seated quicklyfor being a bigger party. Food came out fast and delicious well be returning."}
{"text":"Every weekend I come to First Watch and the service is always outstanding. I usually have one of two regular waitresses and they are always so nice and cheerful. The food is always good and quickly served. If you want a decent breakfast in a nice happy environment then go here."}
{"text":"The service here was wonderful.  The food was up to par and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here twice for breakfast and it was excellent both times.  I would recommend trying one of their drinks, like the cucumber mint or kale tonic. They are very refreshing.  The waitresses are super nice.  The portions are pretty large too, so it's a good value for your money."}
{"text":"We went on our lunch hour at 11:30 on 6/07/16- to beat the rush.  Food was good but the service was horrible.  Took our order and came out.  No one came back to see if everything OK or to refill our drinks we had to ask the busboy.  It took forever to get our checks, she left them on the wrong table, then to actually cash out.  All in all our 1 hour lunch turned into 1.25 hours.  The place wasn't all that busy either.  We won't be going back for lunch.  We also ordered a take out at the end of our meal and that took about 1/2 hour."}
{"text":"Love First Watch! The food was delish and our service by Milinda was outstanding. Thank you"}
{"text":"I first want to start out by saying I love First Watch. I was always reluctant to try it but after the first time I met my soon to be mom in law there for lunch I was hooked. Before I seriously started watching my weight I would usually get the ham and cheese to the fifth degree and the tomato soup combo. *HOLY CHEESY FOODGASM IN MY MOUTH* it is to die for. Although it isn't printed on the menu anymore you can still ask for it and they will make it. Now when we go I order the Power Wrap (which is on the lighter side menu) I never knew egg whites, spinach, turkey, and Swiss cheese topped with salsa could be so damn good. Their mango iced tea is awesome as well. As for the establishment it's self it is always clean. The staff is typically pretty friendly and accommodating. I almost want to give them 5 stars but I do believe some improvements could be made to better some of their menu items. So I'll give it 4 stars... Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good food, not located on 61 and Thomas, the address is 3rd and Thomas. Key West Crepegg, is really good."}
{"text":"Phoenix has done it again with another good favorite breakfast spots. The kale tonic is really refreshing minus the obnoxious \"LA\" price."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast several times at this restaurant. The food and service is always excellent. This is our favorite First Watch."}
{"text":"Food and service great. Prices a little higher than a typical chain but food quality made up for that easily."}
{"text":"My first time here! My husband is a long-time lover of the First Watch in Lawrence, KS.  This location did not disappoint! We used the app No Wait, and they were able to seat our party of 5 + a baby immediately. Service was excellent! But can we talk about the food?! I had the Elevated Egg Sandwich; I cannot describe how amazing this was. I regret not taking a photo, but I was literally 75% into it when the thought even hit me. Great food all the way around the table.. waffles looked great and crispy, bacon was perfect (I stole some off my hubby's plate) and good coffee.  We will totally be back.  Especially since this app just made Saturday morning breakfast with a family freaking possible!!!"}
{"text":"Good fresh healthy food, fast friendly service.  Will eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place really has a nice vibe. It's a \"go after church\" type of place (nice, but also laid back).   Very good /professional service.  Nice relatively healthful choices. free coffee if you need to wait for a seat (we usually wait no more than 15 minutes) Clean, comfy atmosphere. Fair prices. Most importantly: my kids like the food.  I look forward to it about twice a month."}
{"text":"I really love this place! They have the best Waffles in town and the Kale Tonics are amazing ! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that they don't offer Hash browns anymore. They only offer potatoes which we are not huge fans of. Please bring back the Hash browns!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for breakfast.  There is almost never a wait for a table, even on Saturday morning.  The food and service is reliable.  There are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options (which we all sometimes need and want for breakfast).  One of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant years ago.  As it is downtown, it was awfully out of my way to go again.  But, I always thought of it fondly.  Now, that I am only minutes from downtown - I think I will be getting here more often.  I'm almost glad that there are several poor reviews on yelp because it secures my ability to wander in and get a table whenever I please! :)"}
{"text":"The lady next to us had a \"I'd like to speak to your manger\" type hair cut.  The iced coffee was disappointing. It was coffee with ice cubes in it. I was expecting some sort of coffee popsicle. Still good?   The dress code was not posted on the website. I think it would be helpful if they did that. I wore a tuxedo just to be safe. Luckily no one had a problem with it.   Edit: I went back today and got clarification on the iced coffee. The waitress said that a coffee popsicle \"doesn't exist\" and I should \"go invent that because it sounds neat.\""}
{"text":"We love this location! Great service and delicious food. Everything on the menu is delicious. We always leave feeling satisfied with the service. Very clean and large parking lot!"}
{"text":"GREAT service, consistent and top quality food. Ate here twice in a span of days because it was really a well-prepared breakfast.  The menu features some hearty food for a \"guys\" breakfast and lots of healthy alternatives for health-conscious women. Very well-rounded menu but not so many choices that the restaurant loses focus on the food.  Biscuits and gravy was excellent, and was just the right portion size. my over-medium eggs were perfect both times I ordered - a plus for me. I left full but not uncomfotably stuffed. Great staff, very attentive and friendly. Super clean dining area."}
{"text":"While passing through Arizona we stopped for breakfast. we ordered oatmeal to potatoes with eggs, so yummy!! Everything tasted fresh and healthy! Portions were perfect; not too much and not too little.   Staff were friendly and the owner or manager was sweet and made me feel very welcome. Great business and great people."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at First Watch. The staff is very friendly and nice. The food is very delicious. I order the works omelet and my sister order their waffle. And the waffle was light and crispy just the way it should be. I really enjoy the breakfast here. It not your typical breakfast diner type. It is a bit more healthier."}
{"text":"Great service. Really nice design as well. We had the lemon ricotta pancakes and elevated egg sandwich. Both were awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent service, beautiful environment, high quality and delicious food!  The avocado toast and healthy options were very tasty!  Dana Park is a great location for this freshly renovated breakfast establishment."}
{"text":"BEWARE !!!!  This place is nothing compared to The Good Egg that was here at one time.  The service was super slow, the black board had a special smoked salmon and cucumber toast, tried to ordered it they ran out of it, how does a restaurant run out of their special...and if so, then remove it from the board that shows specials...The people beside us order pancakes and they ran out of batter for pancakes so he had to settle for French toast, not the same.  So, anyways so my husband had the traditional breakfast eggs were cold, toast was cold, bacon was microwaved and potatoes were steaming hot, you figure that one out.  I got the egg sandwich which was supposed to be on some fancy bun, it was a  hamburger bun, microwave bacon on  my sandwich, the arugula you couldn't even taste, and we paid almost $10 for a breakfast sandwich, oh forget my potatoes were cold.  I will guarantee you, we will never visit this breakfast place again,   they are supposed to be all about freshness then, don't use microwave bacon that test like jerky, huge plates so they take half of the little tables they have.  We have better service and food at Village Inn on Signal Butte, so people beware of this place.  It is a rip off, terrible food, terrible service and very slow over all, we waited for check for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! When I say we I mean all 5 of us!!! The tweens, the baby and the two adults! Fun for all and if you get a chance to sit outside... do it!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast or lunch find. A new spot, three weeks old, here at 32nd and Camelback. We walked by last week and I'm glad I returned for lunch. Was torn between the Chef Salad or the Chorizo Omelette. Went with the omelette and it was terrific. Only thing I wished for was an espresso which they did not have."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever.  We went in at 2:25 realizing they were closing at 2:30.  We made sure it was still ok to come in.  Manager said SURE.    Waitress looked perturbed the entire time.  Food lukewarm, coffee horrible, what happened to service with a smile.  Oh and BTW waitress was sweeping entire time.  Would NEVER go back.  Stick to Michael's AM in the valley."}
{"text":"I always come here. The food is always consistently good. The iced coffee is delicious. Sometimes the waiters can be rude that is why I did not give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, just go to eat n park. Nothing super healthy about this place and not worth the price. Multigrain pancakes? Is that what makes this place so special? Or that it has low fat organic yogurt? I found my eggs to be cold and waitress a bit rude."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast spot when I'm in town for work (which is often). Quick service, good coffee, and the food is always consistently great. Im picky about how my eggs are cooked and they never overcook them."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Rosemary is so nice. The wait staff is pretty good too! But the food is what keeps me going. Yum! They let our service dog inside with was so nice. Thank you for that! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time to this First Watch since they bought out the Good Egg. It was great. Food was delicious. Really liked their menu selections. Have to say that I found it a big improvement over the Good Egg."}
{"text":"Very good! My prosciutto & fig toast was excellent & Debbie was a nice friendly waitress. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I also love that they bring a pot of coffee to every table. The only complaint that I had was the service was a little slow in the beginning but the food was brought out pretty quick! It is a very cute place and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, medocre food. Our service was dreadful and I wouldn't eat here again if it was free.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"I almost wanna give this place 1 star so that no one goes and I won't have to wait on line!  It's great from start to finish.  The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  The food is always hot and yummy, with good size portions and reasonable prices.  And now I see that management actually reads these posts and answers, too?  Y'all have your ducks (and chickens and turkeys...) in a row!  Good on you and we will be back"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times. It does get really busy but I go on an off hour. So far it has been great. The two things I like the most about it is the interior of the restaurant and the sweet breakfast food options. The inside of First Watch is really pretty with earthy tones and the seating is set up so that is doesn't feel cramped. There are also a lot of booth options. They also have one of my favorite pancakes, they are crispy around the edges and denser on the inside than most, and they have a lot of French toast and pancake options. I would totally recommend them, they are great. Their coffee is also awesome, and the service is really good."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal and the service is always on point. Also want to give a shoutout to Angie for being an amazing server. She is always recommending new items and creative ideas for my order. Would definitely recommend this restaurant! A++"}
{"text":"I went for brunch with a friend and we loved the food. The avocado toast was amazing! Great service and wonderful atmosphere! We were able to check in online before, which made it easy to be seated. :-) The only thing that could have made it better would be mimosas. No alcohol served at brunch."}
{"text":"Good for my kids who don't eat vegan but not I. This is from their company one year ago and still nothing. No non dairy milk options if ridiculous. So is not having a meat alternative. First Watch really needs to get with the times.  4/30/14 Your suggestions to add more options for vegetarians and dairy-free diners have been duly noted. I will pass this information on to our culinary team. We recognize the opportunity to provide more vegetarian and vegan options for our guests. ."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the coffee is putrid. Service is generally OK with occasional mistakes. Usually about a 20 min. wait and the waiting area is always a trainwreck as is doubles as where the line forms to pay. Considering this place is a national chain it certainly could be worse. I've also been to one outside of D.C. and it was pretty much exactly the same."}
{"text":"I really like First Watch.  This location is very clean, the staff super friendly, and we were seated immediately upon arriving at 11am on a Easter Sunday.  The good egg??  Please.  Sure, it's not the world's best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to (I'm from Europe, come on...), but it definitely ranks above any of the other little chain restaurants in AZ.   In an ordinary world, I would give this Restaurant 2, or 3 stars, but we live in the desert where Originality and Menu rarely walk hand in hand.  With that said, at least I know I can depend on First Watch to deliver their dishes in a friendly, fresh, fast and (if you so choose) healthy manner.   * try the Yogurt Fruit Crepe.  * I've never noticed 'just old people' at this restaurant.  I see families and couples.  Unless you consider me old at 28, in that case, sure.  Old."}
{"text":"It was solid food and overall good atmosphere. We ordered a to go order though and they didn't give us what we ordered. They only gave us a third of what we ordered and I had to call to find a solution which ended up being a free entree if I ever end up there again which was a little disappointing because I would have just rather had them negate what I paid for and didn't receive; but the manager told me we'd have to come back in to reimburse my card, which I've worked at plenty of restaurants that are able to negate a pending transaction.. So I got ripped off in the end which never feels great. I don't know how restaurants that are not fast food places get the one thing wrong that their supposed to do right which is give people what they paid for."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having a rough day, but multiple tables have been open for 30 minutes and they are having trouble seating people. Also having trouble bussing tables, bringing out food, and checking people out at the cash register. No one seems to have a defined role, but they are all doing everything. Maybe that adds to the chaos. It gets frustrating to see 8 open tables for 30 minutes with NO ONE getting seated at them. I am chalking it up to it being new, but this place is a hot mess disaster."}
{"text":"Eat your breakfast or lunch anytime. Offerings average $7.50 or so.  Free wi-fi & newspaper. Indie, folksy music if you happen to enjoy that.  Lots of healthy choices, personal pot of coffee ($2.29) excepted - bye bye nap!  Substitute their whole grain wheat bread (yum) for the English muffin. Suggestion to First Watch: offer something other than ordinary Smucker's jams to complement the fresh fare. Great food and service."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for some 10 years.  The transition from the Good Egg to First Watch was a bit bumpy but we hung in there as hick-ups can be expected with new staff and menus.  But it is not getting better, it is getting worse.  I have no clue what First Watch management is doing to this place, they paid good $$ to acquire the Good Egg restaurants yet the food and service is getting worse.  Is it really that difficult to make pancakes that are not liquid in the middle?  Omelette mediocre at best.  Service persons forget to put in orders and food comes out at different times for a table of 4.  Giving up...."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast tucked inside the Scottsdale Promanade. Like the fact that they have healthy choices on the menu. The \"Tri-Athlete\" omelette comes just the way I would order it....egg whites and veggies, no cheese, fruit, and a dry english muffin. If your feeling really hungry, add an order of the banana granola pancakes - they are awesome.  Service is always great...get there early, especially on the weekend. By 8:30AM they generally have a wait. Good food that is healthy and a far better value than the Good Egg."}
{"text":"Greatest breakfast spot ever!! Have to get our annual fix when we visit from CA for spring training. Three days in a row & everything's delicious! Healthy options, unique options, & everything's amazing. Staff's awesome too. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Just had a most excellent breakfast! Trifecta- 2 eggs, pancake (waffle was also an option) with real maple syrup, and not just a tiny side dish of it- I got a small bottle! Fresh squeezed OJ, awesome. Coffee could be a bit better, but it's decent."}
{"text":"Refreshing variety. Great place for brunch. Food is creative and delicious. Service is great."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the Peninsula area. My friends and I ate breakfast here on our way out of town after camping at heritage farms over the weekend and it was the bomb dot com. Our server was incredible!! I had the eggs  Florentine and the coffee was so good."}
{"text":"So glad that first watch opened another location. I love having brunch here. I especially like the Avocado Sea Salt Toast.   Every meal I have had at settlers ridge as well as this location have been very consistent. I especially like the decor at this location. Like the community tables."}
{"text":"Another incredible breakfast. I look forward to hitting fresh watch after my workouts on the weekend. The restaurant never lets me done. Great healthy food & great service.   I do however miss the seasonal guacamole toast and eggs!!! I could eat this every day of the week when in season!!!"}
{"text":"Great bacon!  Really good food, good portions, and great service... and the bacon!  They have a pretty nice breakfast and lunch assortment and fantastic bacon.  The prices are decent for the portion size.  I'm gonna have to read through this review to see if I've mentioned the BACON.  Anyways, when you go, be sure to get ya some bacon... enjoy."}
{"text":"Best hungover breakfast ever! Lived in the valley my whole life and can't believe ive never been here! Lots of great healthy options, very yummy, and good atmosphere/staff(thanks Christiana)"}
{"text":"Returned for brunch. The service was great. The food was good, including the coffee. Much better on this visit."}
{"text":"OMG! I love breakfast and this one knocked me on my A$$!!! Ellen was awesome and the Bacado is THE best!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious!!! Staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. The only thing I didn't like was the acoustics - it was difficult to have a conversation because it was kinda loud."}
{"text":"Stone & Barrel down the street wins hands down. Been here THREE separate times, can see why the place has few customers. Takes forever to be seated, then wait & wait for even a glass of water. Wait some more finally get a menu delivered; then wait some more; order coffee; you guessed it wait some more. Finally get to order...still waiting on my coffee. Simple eggs & bacon order finally comes not the way I ordered; begged for my COFFEE; finally get it...yet it's cold. Can't take it anymore I leave to pay my check; give cashier a $50 bill; takes 3 attempts to get the proper change back. Stone & Barrel here I come!"}
{"text":"Will never eat here again. I gave first watch 2 chances. The first time my breakfast came out cold-the eggs, potatoes, biscuits... everything was cold. The next time I went, I ordered the biscuits & gravy. I DO NOT recommend. Flavorless and watered down. The customer next to me also ordered the biscuits and gravy and instantly returned it. Worse biscuits and gravy I have ever had."}
{"text":"First visit today. Waitress was awesome. Very friendly. Food I swear was delivered right after I ordered. Hot & fresh & delicious! Will definitely be back! I had breakfast tacos. Delicious  Very clean as well."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed everything about First Watch. Staring with the on-line wait list, which was really  convenient because of their popularity. The staff was very enjoyable and attentive. The food was excellent. We returned to enjoy the food and staff again during our week stay in Phoenix for Spring training. We will add this to our must go to place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, loved the way they portrayed their look. I got the avocado toast  and it was very good. The toast is a little thick and a bit dry, however, served with the over easy eggs was perfect . I would definitely like to come back here again and try something new."}
{"text":"if you have kids make sure you think twice before going here.  kids are fussy sometimes and parents always try..but for them to come over and say if we can shut our kid up is kind of rude.  my kid was not even making any noise when the hostess came over."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast spot!!!! The breakfast quinoa bowl is my go to and my wife loves the Avocado toast.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food wasn't bad. It just wasn't tasty enough that I will go here again.  I went on a weekday, so they weren't that busy. My omelet came fairly quickly, but when I started eating, it was just warm - not hot. As a result, by the time I finished eating, it was cold. Also, the menu said it came with sour cream, but the sour cream was about a teaspoon on the top of the omelet, so I would say it fell more into the category of a garnish, instead of an ingredient. Last, they were also very sparing of the cheese. With very little cheese to hold the ingredients of the omelet together, eating it was an exercise in spearing the individual items of the omelet with my fork.   First and last time."}
{"text":"This place is probably going to be my forever breakfast place! I had elevated egg sandwich and the drink called Day Glow. I loved them both, wish took a picture hopefully next time :)"}
{"text":"First Watch sent me a coupon so I could give them another try after my last review. That was a nice gesture. The service was excellent. Our food did arrive in a timely manner. They were out of potatoes! Really?? I ordered an English muffin and received toast. The waitress did offer to take the toast back and get me the muffin, but I decided to try the toast which looked good and it was. A very hearty flavorful bread was used. The food did come hot this time. I expect a better omelet from a breakfast place. It was flat. So, I'm upping my review from a 2 to a 3 star. Sorry First Watch. You still need to do better. I do thank you for the coupon."}
{"text":"I was torn whether to do 3 or 4 stars. The restaurant is very nice. The service was excellent.  My eggs and potatoes were just OK. The omelet was more flat than fluffy, the potatoes could have been cooked longer and my granddaughters bacon was just this side of burned. The waffles were nice and the kids were given fresh fruit with their meals. All the employees were very nice and the waitress was attentive.  The restaurant doesn't smell greasy which has turned me off at other breakfast places. Maybe they need to spend a little more and get better chefs."}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch several times but not for quite a while. We arrived with 3 adults a baby and a toddler. After waiting for about 45 minutes for our food while people that arrived after us being served, I finally said somthing. Shortly after that our food arrived. My omelet was flat and everything on my plate was cold. I sent it back. Other than decent coffee and nice staff there isnt much to say. They did cover the check for us though."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say that my I enjoyed my breakfast. However, the Bacado (Bacon +Avocado) omelette was a bacon omelette with a sliver of avocado on top. I kept expecting to find more avocado inside the omelette, but I never did. Just a single very thin slice on top. Again, it was good, but basically a bacon omelette with an avocado garnish."}
{"text":"Generous 3 stars... I've been eating at first watch for over 15 years including the original in Florida. I don't know if the company will actually read these reviews but they need to get their act together over here on Happy Valley. Half empty restaurant with a 30 minute wait on a Saturday morning makes no sense. If it was full I would get it completely ( I'm not that customer ).Food is ALWAYS inconsistent. Come on First Watch, you are better then this!"}
{"text":"I do believe I'll be making this great place a weekend habit!! The moment we walked in I noticed the fresh concept and fun decor which I loved! The staff was friendly, the menu options of tasty goodness amazing! I ordered the tri athlete(one of the many healthier options offered) and I was able to sub the English muffin out for a green mix salad. My meal was full of flavor and beautifully presented. My son had the banana crunch pancakes. My fork \"accidentally\" found it's way over to his plate after I saw his 2 enormous delicious looking pancakes! If you like banana bread you have to order this! Sooooooo good!! We split the honeydew fresh pressed juice because I just had to know how that tasted. Loved it! They have 2 more flavors that I will try another time. I already can't wait to take out of town guest here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, best breakfast I have had in awhile!  Are at snooze in Scottsdale this week, I will be coming here many times over!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what was going on here this morning, but I can tell you I have eaten at this brand many times and had a good to very good experience... Today, uh not so much. Although my food was fine, my server and the rest of the kitchen staff seemed very unhappy and inattentive. After I finished my food some other unhappy persons asked if I was OK. Far different atmosphere from what I have been used to in my \"First Watch\" breakfast experience. My suggestion would be to find another location!"}
{"text":"It was good,my daughter ordered  a (humongous)  pancake that was advertised on the menu,and I told her it would be HUGE & upon  arrival  it was only covering about 1/2 of the plate. We were a little  disappointed, rest was OK. If you say BIG make it big."}
{"text":"I recently rediscovered First Watch and my taste buds have been completely satisfied each time I go!  My favorite is definitely the Elevated Egg Sandwich, so filling & delicious!  I've yet to have anything that wasn't super yummy! Everyone is always super friendly and attentive. We got great service from the awesome Ellen today, she even let us taste samples of the daily tonics. Thumbs up to the Morning Meditation!"}
{"text":"Kind and familiar faces all around. Wonderful, wonderful food (thanks for the nutritional information). It's affordable and I love it."}
{"text":"A great place! It was recommended by Yelp for brunch. Excellent recommendation. The service was excellent, food came out fast and was delicious. The menu was extensive with originals. Not just the standard breakfast items. Lots of healthy choices along with a few decadent ones. Made it very hard to choose!  I will definitely come back here next time I visit Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"We came to this part of Phoenix because I need treatment at the Mayo Clinic. My wife wanted an omelette and I suggested a nearby Denny's. Fortunately we found this place instead. Both my wife and daughter started with a Day-Glo smoothie which looked and tasted terrific. I had the Avocado Smash accompanied by basted eggs. I love basted eggs and most places don't even know what they are. My wife didn't actually have an omelette after all, but that is another and old old story. She had a crepe and a piece of French toast separately and we (transplanted Vermonters) found out that we could get real maple syrup (from VT) for only $1.39 extra. Again, most places don't even know what real maple syrup is. While we are here. WE WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"When we first moved here almost 2 years ago, First Watch was our go to spot.  Over the fall and winter,  things have declined to the point that we have decided to stop going.  Why?  If you order crisp potatoes, I guarantee you will get at least 15% burnt black potatoes.  I will attach pictures if I can. I ordered a sausage and mushroom breakfast and there were ZERO sausages in it!   I even showed the manager and he credited me the meal and said he would talk to the chef. Didn't help. Next Neal, burnt again!  Bye bye first watch!"}
{"text":"This place is an excellent place to eat and the prices are great. Servers are exceptionally friendly and polite. 5 star!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened!!?  I've been a good egg customer ever since this store opened.  Now it 100% first watch and its really gone down hill.  Menu went from good ol fashion breakfast to trendy health food in a second flat.   i mean, side salad for breakfast?  c'mon. but that's not the main issue.... Service and food quality has been getting worse every time weve come here.  The last visit, we sat outside and there was creamer sitting in the sun.  I opened it to put in my coffee and it was all curdled.  I waited 15 minutes before i got up and tracked down our waitress.  Then they brought me new coffee which tasted like it was sitting in a hot plate for 2 years, and there was a film on the top.  I gave up on the coffee... i drank the water.  My wife's meal had burnt toast and my potatoes were literally raw.  it had a little char on the outsite but wasnt actually cooked.  It had a crunch like i was biting into an apple.  after the food was dropped off, we never saw our waitress again until i tracked her down (again) for the check.  we had wanted to have a side of something and maybe a water refill, mid-meal... but we gave up on that as well. really sad to see my favorite breakfast place go down the tubes"}
{"text":"the food was amazing the service was great coffee eas really good the manager answered all our questions and was very nice. i will definitelybe back soon and will recommend first watch to everyone thank you to all the staff who helped us two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Decent spot with reasonable prices for a quick breakfast, brunch or lunch. I tried the Power Wrap for lunch.  It was fresh and filling. Egg whites, turkey, spinach, mushrooms and Swiss cheese in a tortilla wrap.  Loved the fresh fruit on the side and fresh brewed coffee refills."}
{"text":"We went there this morning  and were greeted by a very nice lady. They have  lemon infused water and cofee out side while we waited. We love that. We were seated in Keith's  section    what a great server. He was very attentive and had great suggestion on good dishes.He and the greeter both suggested the avacodo toast and Belgium  waffles so yummy. A must try along with the kale tonic. We will definitely be back and suggest it to our friends."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service and we had awesome food. I tried the cherry chicken quinoa bowl and green tea...yum!!"}
{"text":"This was the third and last time we have gone to this establishment.  We have gone back a few times because it is within walking distance from where we live and my family loves breakfast spots so we were real excited to have a spot so close. Unfortunately it's disorganized as soon as you walk in, each time we have gone they have the host/greeter in a different spot and each time there always seemed to be some confusion about what was going on causing an unnecessary wait.  Once seated you can look forward to small tables loaded with lots of unnecessary junk. Oversized plates with sparse uninspired offerings that sound better on paper than in reality.  Last but not least is the check which will most likely be double that of other comparable breakfast style restaurants. In my opinion there are better places to spend your time and money unless of course your in the market for disappointment."}
{"text":"Pretty decent brunch place in the Glendale area. Not too many brunch places like this on this side of town. Prices are reasonable. Another yelper mentioned that this place is expensive. It is when you're comparing it to The Place and Black Bear, but when you're comparing the type of food you're getting to other restaurants of similar caliber, the prices are really not bad! Service is a little slow but decent. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The ONLY food in Cuyahoga Falls unless you cook yourself.  Healthy, locally grown food, great menu, attentive staff bends over backwards to please.  Love the Common Table and have met really nice foodies here.  Takes the stigma out of dining alone in a small town.  I've been here about six times since it opened.  Everything has been spectacular.  Don't waste your money anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants. If you are looking for HEALTHY food look no further. Amazing flavors great service. You HAVE to try this place. You won't be disappointed and you will leave full but at the same time portions aren't huge. Just right and all organic.."}
{"text":"The service was fine but I went there when it was pretty slow. Great food and menu! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and excelent service.  Highly recomend this First Watch to anyone.  Only complaint is that there is not one where we live."}
{"text":"Delishious!  I hand the Gruyere and ham omelet with potatoes and wheat toast and everything was fantastic. The toast was a thick slice which I love and the potatoes had onion in them. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This location has terrible service and food quality. We got rotten fruit and a dish that was missing an ingredient. When we mentioned it to the manager he looked through the dish missing the ingredient (tomatoe), he found ONE piece that was the size of and eraser and said that's how it comes. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service is the worse I have had in a very long time. Our waitress never ever came back to our table after taking our order. For refills we had to wave down then manager and a random server put our bill on our table as soon as we got our food, when we wanted to order more. When we expressed our disappointment to the manager in our service he could care less. Very disappointed in a place that has potential."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service here! Ordered the Chorizo Omelette, a Frittata and a Banana Granola pancake. My favorite was the pancake! It was crunchy and gooey at the same time.. yum! We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"A great place for a family and friends to go for brunch. Be warned that wait times for a seat and then for food can be long on a weekend. Our last visit involved a one hour delay between our entry into the restaurant and getting our food. We still had a good visit and will return. If you've never been to a FirstWatch, think Denny's breakfast, just much classier."}
{"text":"Just tried first watch for the first time and I will never go back. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre ar best. I ordered the farmers sandwich. ..the egg and bacon were overcooked...the country potatoes were mushy and bland. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict, so little hollandaise sauce that it was barely present  and the salad had no dressing. We waited 1/2 an hour for our bill."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and found it to be tasty and a good value.  I chose an albacore sandwich (tuna salad) and the pecan dijon salad for the 1/2 and 1/2 for $7+.  The salad was more like a warm compote made of chopped pecans, chicken, crunchy veg and a dijon cream dressing.   Friend chose an egg white veggie omelet and was able to make up a meal to fit her stringent diet."}
{"text":"The service was very poor. Waited 15 minutes for server to come after sitting down then another 30 minutes for food to come out 3 of the 4 meals were cold.  We were to hungry to send it back. The place was bought out by big corporation and they lost it. Will never go back. No attempt was made to rectify the issue"}
{"text":"First Watch, formerly known as The Good Egg, has been and continues to be my favorite breakfast place for the past 10 years. The rebranding into First Watch was surprisingly successful and has, as a result, made the food better than ever. The atmosphere is nice and quiet with eloquent decor. The staff, especially Greg my favorite server, are helpful, friendly and attentive. I would recommend First Watch highly to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast tacos without cheese and it's delicious! I didnt want the beans that came with it as a side, the server offered fruits or potatoes instead. That was nice! Some servers won't do that. The atmosphere is very relaxing, the place looks polished and everyone was very friendly. It was a great time overall!"}
{"text":"We love to take our family here for a special breakfast out.  The food is fresh and what we would want to cook for ourselves.  Our kids love the crepes, french toast, pancakes, etc. just for them.  Great place for people who are picky or want the old standbys, as well as those who have a more adventurous breakfast spirit.  Every menu item we try has been good, every time."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and it was very prompt after order. We had a trainee and he still did a great job. It's local to us so it's convenient to finally have a good breakfast spot you can count on. I heard originally there were issues but seems as though they are all worked out!"}
{"text":"OMG! The avocado toast is absolutely addictive!  Thick slices of whole grain bread, smeared with thick spread of avocado and light touches of flavor cannot be beat!  I must have it at least twice a month! Lemon juice adds an extra dimension, and get the soft scrambled eggs for best combo! The ham and cheese sandwich - croque madame if you please - blew me away! A rich sandwich for sure but loaded with flavor and herbs. Gruyere cheese and dijonnaise made it superb. Add the Kale Tonic -  Even if you don't like kale you will never know it is there.  This drink is refreshing and light and satisfying with the cucumber and apple flavors predominant.  The restaurant is VERY busy at lunch so go breakfast or late lunch.  The servers are very friendly and helpful and the restroom is kept clean even at the busiest time.    The menu is quite extensive and even though I have only tasted a few of the goodies, I have to say that it is a menu for all tastes.  If you want bacon and potatoes, it's there!  If you want vegan it's there and if you want vegetarian it's there!  All very fresh and mostly original."}
{"text":"I have been to three locations of this establishment and have been prettty pleased with my visits. I always opt for  breakfast here... The Acapulco express omelette is excellent..chorizo, avocado, green chilies and onions, melted cheeses, sour cream and their fresh made salsa.  I also love their french toast, which along with pancakes and waffles are made from scratch. The Floridian french toast used to be Arizona french toast and had the most delectible prickly pear butter with it, but it's newer incarnation is covered in berries and kiwi and is tasty nonetheless. I have never had bad service here. I've mostly received 25% tip worthy attentiveness.  I like how there seems to be delightful little bowls of fruit on the side with most entrees. (And not just crappy melons and grapes) Also, the coffee isn't bad and they have the courtesy to leave a fresh caraffe full so I am never caffeine deprived when leaving. All in all its a solid joint for breakfast in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I think I hit this place on an off day. The food was so-so as was the service.   I ordered one pancake and a side of potatoes. The pancake was dense and the potatoes were barely warm. I wasn't able to finish the pancake nor my potatoes. My daughter opted for an early lunch and she had the sandwich and a salad. She pawned the salad off on me, but it was completely  sopped with dressing (oil) that I couldn't eat that either.   I left to visit the ladies room and when I returned, the server had left the bill on the table with my children. WTH?"}
{"text":"Such good pumpkin pancakes I can't wait to be back here. Just so you know, you pay at the register when you're leaving-just like IHOP or Biscuits Cafe. I do not recommend their mixed non-alcoholic special drinks, those were gross unfortunately. The atmosphere here is bright and casual. Unlike a breakfast place like IHOP where you're in private booths, probably why families with screaming kids like it there I just realized-no one can tell which booth it's emanating from, this place has a big open room where you are in closer proximity to each table next to you. There's bright windows and dark decor, so it's like an in-between fanciness between the sad IHOP and corporate mega star Cheesecake. This is definitely similar to Biscuits Cafe but instead of focusing on more southern or huge menus, this focuses on more healthy or seasonal food options with a smaller menu."}
{"text":"WTF ??  A breakfast place that does not serve buttermilk pancakes ???  What a joke !!   You could hear the screaming from the kitchen throughout the entire meal.  They replaced the Good Egg which was FAR better.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Thank goodness they took over Good Egg... if you want UNHEALTHY food, go somewhere else. NO Chicken Fried Steak and FAT LOADED Dishes. THIS IS A HEALTHY and some of the BEST FOOD around!!  I absolutely LOVE the TRI-ATHLETE Omelet and the MARKET VEG is so YUMMY and good for you, that you'll feel so energetic that you'll want to run around the block!! So different from those heavy sauces, fat laden, typical, run of the mill breakfast places, that make you take a NAP afterward. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT HIGHLY ENOUGH!! Completely ignore any review that talks longingly about \"The Good Egg\" and missing those types of breakfasts... go to Denny's for your fill of CRAP FOOD.  I have been to this location and the Dana Park location in Mesa and both offer EXCELLENT FOOD, Superb SERVICE at an EXCELLENT PRICE!!  LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was amazed. Reasonable wait for a Sunday morning. Very friendly staff. Our waitress Natalie was amazing. She made it easy for us to order our food even with exceptions and substitutions. Natalie was very attentive and made sure our meals, drinks, etc were ok. Great place for a Sunday breakfast/brunch - will definitely return & ask for Natalie again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before when it was The Good Egg but am LOVING the First Watch changes. The manager came over to greet me personally and my server (Desmond) was polite, knowledgeable of the new menu and offered an excellent suggestion to my normal favorite. I tried the healthy egg white omelette w/spinach, feta cheese and sli"}
{"text":"The food is very good. I had a fritada rustica with potatoes.  My only complaint is the pricing for the type of food it is,  its a little high."}
{"text":"deliciousss food! coffee was average at best. one of the items we ordered for breakfast wasn't ready to be served so they let us pick something else free of charge. they also charge for maple syrup, which is a little off, but overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"This was not my first time at this First Watch but I've never felt the need to write a review until now. This Mayfield location has revamped it's look and updated the menu as well. My husband and I stopped in for brunch and were blown away by the BLTE-it sounds basic but is far from it! The artisan bread, the fresh greens and combination of cheese and bacon were by far the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! Not greasy at all and huge! I also tried the new root down juice they have-I chose the kale tonic, it was fresh and delicious! I really like the changes they've made and will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on the good reviews. Awesome food, organic and gluten-free items. And the service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Server completely got our order wrong and then it took as long to get the correct order as it did to get the first order. My kids and I were done eating before my wife even got her meal. The kids were restless from sitting so long so I took the kids outside. My wife spoke to the manager and the server hadn't even informed him of the situation. My wife finally just took her meal to go and ate it cold at home. They didn't charge us for our meals so there's that. IF, we go back we will be sure not to sit in this servers section."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Eggs preparation was on point and presentation was up to par. The place is clean, tidy, wonderful ambiance with open layout inviting plenty of daylight into the dining area.   The hostesses and servers were attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Today's (10/14/17) chef isn't the best....dried poached eggs on my Eggs Benedict, food was barely warm, hollandaise sauce was runny and translucent, so yes, take it back and just bring me the elevated egg sandwich which was just ok since I was looking forward to Eggs Benedict, and for whatever reason the top brioche bun was larger than the bottom making for a sloppy breakfast. Yes, now I remember why we haven't been back for a while! Park Central and Scottsdale get it right the first time!"}
{"text":"I loved the relaxed atmosphere and the food was delicious  makes any morning bfast feel like Sunday brunch. avacado toast with eggs a must. Millionaire bacon was good but hold the maple syrup if sensitive to sugar.  The market has and works omlette also wonderful if looking for a blg bfast, enough to share especially if get side of toast."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast yesterday for the first time. After reading past poor reviews since First Watch bought the previous AZ chain a few years ago I had no interest in coming here. What a pleasant surprise. Chris, our waitress is excellent. She was very attentive to us checking on us frequently to make sure everything was right with our order, refilling our coffee etc. Our food was really good. I ordered the classic tri-fecta breakfast. My husband ordered a hash dish with italian sausage. we also bought a loaf of sprouted bread to take home.  We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Came here for bunch with a friend. The food was good, nothing spectacular. The service was great though. Fast, efficient, friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. No Wait made the experience seamless.  Enjoyed the Salmon Eggs Benedict. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews.   Short line this AM, quickly seated. Promptly served cold decaf (in thermos pot). Wife ordered benny with HARD eggs, emphasized hard several times as soft turns her stomach. Arrived soft - no one bothered to check. They offer a remake, of course, so now we get to enjoy going out to watch each other eat - together.   My steak and eggs, ordered med-rare comes out blue rare and tough. Egg yolk is broken. Potatoes are cooked to death and hard. Toast and coffee was fine.   Waitress comes back with remade benny, wife tells her my steak is rare, she asks if I want it remade. I put it on the side plate and tell her she can take it to the kitchen to toss it out. She seems offended by my attitude. Can't include my inside voice thoughts here.  She returns a couple of minutes later and tells us the manager comps the bill. Never saw or heard from the manager. Never saw her again.  In my experience, there's a lack of standards here or this many mistakes wouldn't have happened in a single visit. It's an egg place, you'd think they'd have that part figured out.  The manager never bothered to make an appearance, perhaps of the view that your best course of action is to buy off the unhappy customers and hope they don't come back.   You win.   The lesson here is that if you dine here, and your food doesn't live up to the menu, complain a bit and you'll get to eat (sort of) for free!   Probably not as bad as this experience, but there's lots of 'at least as good' options in the area."}
{"text":"We are glad they opened a location nearby.  It is good, fresh tasting food.  I can't say it's \"healthy,\" but it has many healthier choices on their menu than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Great if you don't have any diet restrictions. But, for me, not a single Gluten Free option is a deal breaker. My hubby loved his."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff are always friendly. Be careful of the pancakes, they are like a pound each and are addictive."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a First Watch and it was delicious! It was a Saturday morning and very busy, but we were seated quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. My husband had the \"Traditional\" and devoured it all. I ordered one chocolate chip pancake that was light and fluffy, the \"Millionaire's bacon\" that was sweet and spicy, and a small fruit cup, which while fresh and sweet, was a little pricy at $3.99 for the tiny ramekin in which it came. Overall though we enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers don't want to go to First Watch anymore because they think it's too expensive.  They're right.  It no longer is a $ restaurant, it's a $$ restaurant.  You can't have a meal and a drink in there for less than $10.  That's for the cheapest choices.  Get something more expensive, or get a side, or a la carte, and you are easily in the $15+ range - for breakfast.  Get real, First Watch.  So for that kind of money I expect the best food and service and even some ambiance.  You'll get none of the above.  As others here say, things used to be better, and they are going downhill.  I have my theories which I will offer soon.  On a Tues at 10 am, the place maybe 50% full, I waited 10 mins after being seated to get a coffee.  The waitress kept disappearing for extended periods, making brief darting appearances into the dining room like a mouse carefully foraging at night.  The other tables were experiencing the same neglectful treatment, and people kept having to re-ask for water, coffee, juice, etc.    My food arrived, a $9 skillet, and it was bleh.  The potatoes were cold, the mushrooms were almost uncooked, and the ham was in tiny cubes, less than 5 mm in size, and stingy in portion.  The dish didn't taste seasoned, and it didn't taste cooked so much as microwaved.  The eggs were cooked well though.    Something that totally ticks me off about many breakfast places that First Watch does, is to not provide any combo breakfasts that include pancakes.  The only way to get them is as a head explodingly overpriced side - $3.39 for one pancake.  This is clearly in ripoff territory, and that's all that should be said about it, ripoff.  For $3.39, you might expect real maple syrup, but you will get synthetic syrup and margarine.  My pancake made of dollars was good, but again, when you pay this much money, your expectations are justifiably raised, and they weren't met.    My 3 coffee creamers were gone, and I couldn't get anybody's attention to get some more.  At one point my waitress went to another table near mine.  She looked at me and I looked at her to get her attention, and she just turned around and walked the other direction.  During my stay, the waitress was at my table 3x - once to seat me, once to take my order, and a 3rd time to bring my food.  I never saw her otherwise.  After I'd eaten, I still didn't have my check, so I walked up to the cashier. I encountered another waitress who was sniffing and rubbing her nose - not the most waitress-y thing to do in sight of your customers.  I was asked repeatedly how the food and service were, and I said it wasn't good.  They immediately tried to discount my bill (I refused).  But at the same time they wouldn't listen to me as I tried to explain what the specific shortcomings were, they just kept trying to give me freebies.  I cut the waitress off and said, \"I want you to listen to why I didn't like my meal, not to offer me comps.\"    Note that another reviewer mentioned that one of the waitresses was sweating.  I noticed another talking nonstop, and another one snuffling.  Make of it what you will.    Suggestions: --Reduce prices by at least 15% --Combo breakfasts that include a range of choices, including pancakes.  The menu is too rigid. --Reduce pancake prices by half.  Make them even cheaper if purchased as a side to another meal. --Quick beverage service. --More comfortable seating. --A policy to have wait staff checking on customers throughout the meal. --Random drug testing for waitstaff.  I think it would solve a lot of problems."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast this Mother's Day and sat outside for the first time to take advantage of the last bit of cool-ish weather. Breakfast was delicious as always and they even gave me a little box of chocolates. -oh and love the kid options!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service! Great new location. The decor is a HUGE upgrade from the other locations. Love the avacado toast...This is my new Sunday staple."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! I had the avocado hash! Fresh and delicious! My kids had chocolate chip pancakes...again hot fresh and delish! We love the fresh brewed coffee as well as the friendly service. We will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I lucked our way here, based on 2 minutes of Yelp searching for a quick bite to eat on the drive from the Phoenix airport to Sedona. We couldn't have been happier that we found First Watch.  This First Watch was conveniently located off the highway for us, but inside was very unrushed, comfortable and homey but still cool and decorated with a rustic feel--very unlike how you'd imagine a highway-side location to feel. The food was packed with attractive healthy options, and we both truly enjoyed our meals--one 2-fer superfood kale salad and havarti and roast beef sandwich, and a power quinoa bowl with \"basted\" eggs (resembling an egg over easy, but cooked without oil or butter).  The service was extremely friendly, and the whole experience made us very appreciative of having had a chance to pass by. We'd definitely stop in again if we're headed the same way again, and would recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here today, none of us had ever been.  The food was terrible, they skimp on all their ingredients.  I ordered the killer Cajun omelette, there was the portions of the food were extremely small, and all the ingredients in the omlette were all on one side of the omlette.  As my father was paying the bill the hostess asked how our meals were, and my dad told her...not very good.  This girl said nothing after!!  Nothing!  If you want below average food and service....this is your place!  If you are looking for a good breakfast then there are many better places in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast location. Wonderful service. Highly recommend! Pancakes perfect!  Eggs done exactly as ordered. Bacon done to perfection. Bread used for toast is out of this world. No complaints."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday, only one waitress and no one greeted us at the door when we arrived. We waited a few more minutes to be seated and waited some more while at the table to get our coffee orders in, and then 10 min passed and the coffee arrived. Not impressed with the wait times, on a non busy morning, I can only imagine how bad it must be when it's busy! The coffee was watered down, the food was bleh..they over cooked my pancake and it was dry..the other meal with ham was also dry. Never eaten here, but we won't return. Hate the wooden benches, the chairs are uncomfortable as well. You need to re-think these torture devices, or at the least give out cushions. The atmosphere looks good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant!  It seems to be a very popular place.  Only open until 3, it serves breakfast and lunch all day.  Their fresh-squeezed juices are delicious, as is everything else on their menu.  The times are all very health-conscious and organic, meaning that they are also a little more pricey, but everything is worth every penny. Be sure to ask for Victoria when you go, she's always on top of her game."}
{"text":"It's about time I wrote a review on this place. I'm not sure what took me so long. LOVE IT. Me and my husband ALWAYS go out for breakfast on Sunday morning since we started dating. Every single week. This place has become our Sunday tradition because it's so good. And this is coming from people that go to breakfast A LOT. I think for about 6 months now we haven't gone anywhere else. First things first, they have really good coffee. I'm not a coffee snob or anything but this is just very tasty. Their breakfasts are awesome, I always get either the breakfast tacos or the Chickichanga.  This is the only place I've ever been that uses chicken in some breakfast meals. Why isn't that ingredient used more?  Hubby usually gets one of those or an omelet and they're SO good.  They have this energy drink of blended fruits and veggies called Day Glow that we love. And to top it all off, you can use the NoWait app to reserve a spot in line from home then just show and be seated even when it's super crowded. I LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Expect to pay a bit more than most places, but the choices are healthy. You really can't go wrong. Nice staff, kid friendly. Only open during the day, so don't make dinner plans to go here :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was terrible! Potatoes were cold and butter didn't even melt on the waffle so that was cold too. Don't bother going!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I am never disappointed with anything I order here. The food is fresh and full of flavor. The staff is great. I recommended the tomato soup, one of the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"First watch acquired The Good Egg and now completely changed the menu.  I respect that the company has to push their image they want. But being a loyal customer for 6 years every weekend.  They have now lost my business.  No basic buttermilk pancakes or flavored ice tea.   The \"multigrain pancakes\" the last three weekends had be sent back as they were undercooked and raw batter.   Pity as they didn't seem to care what the local patrons wanted. I completed a survey last weekend and asked to be contacted as well.  They never have."}
{"text":"The pot roast hash is the bomb! Comfortable place, better for breakfast, lunch menu is on the small side, but still worth a try. Service is competent, maybe a little relaxed.Like that they bring bottle of water to the table, & your own pot of coffee."}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to First Watch Restaurants since I was a child, I'm 35 now.  We have always loved their food and the people.  As an adult, I go to the First Watch on Thomas Rd and I love the updated look and the food.  This morning my sister invited me out to breakfast and we were both so excited to see that the Good Egg on Ray Rd was now a First Watch.  Happily, I accepted and we went with her two children (daughter who is almost one and a son who is three).   The food and wait staff were wonderful; however our experience was marred by the manager.  If looks could kill!  He was unpleasant to be around and was quite frankly, a curmudgeon.  My nephew and niece are children and while I do not condone bad behavior at restaurants by children, both of them were far from disruptive.  My niece was loud but not crying.  She's learning to talk, she's learning to hear her own voice.  My nephew is three and while he did not stay seated the whole time we were there, he was NOT disruptive.  He walked near the bathroom but did NOT go in and out of it OR disturb other guests. He did NOT yell or throw food or whine. He giggled and laughed.  My sister and I completely understand that some guests might not want to sit next to toddlers and one couple was reseated.  The manger did handle that appropriately.  However, the rest of our time there he would walk past our table, which was near the restroom, just to see what my nephew was doing.  Then he would walk past us  again and give my nephew and us a look mimicking \"shaking my head.\"  As we left, there was couch and just like any toddler, my nephew leaped onto it.  He did NOT stand on it or jump on it.  He was happy and oblivious to the dirty stares given by this manager.  However, we were not oblivious to those stares and as he walked pasted us with a surly look on his face, I stated, \" You don't have to look at us like that.\"  To which he did not respond or even attempt to address.  Listen, I've been a waitress and a hostess in the past.  And I have worked for high-end restaurants to your local \"mom and pop\" diner and I have seriously never encountered a manager this unhappy and rude.  My sister and her husband take their children to restaurants all the time and the kids have behaved similarly to today and she has never been made to feel like a bad mother in all her experiences at a restaurant.  Needless to say, we will not be going back to First Watch on Ray Rd. as long as that manager is still employed there.  I have NEVER written a Yelp review before but he, for lack of a better term, poked the bear. He's the manager of a breakfast place.  You are to be happy and cheerful.  He unfortunately lacks the tact and understanding needed for a managerial position.  I would steer clear of this place if you have children. Try U.S. Egg down the road, they are a lot more kid friendly and happy!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in town, the most reasonable prices and the service is always good. They have the greatest avocado toast!!"}
{"text":"This location of First Watch has been extremely disappointing since it changed over from the Good Egg. I have been here twice to get to go orders, and the first time I went I ordered a create-your-own omelette with spinach and kalamata olives. I was told that they didn't have the olives anymore, but got no explanation why (I.e. That the restaurant had changed hands). I had a frequent customer card filled for a free meal and they almost didn't take it. I was told that they wouldn't be accepting the cards in the future, and again no explanation why was given.   Today I called to try to place a to go order for Father's Day. When I called in the person who answered yelled to the staff \"who can take a to go order\" a couple of times, then put me on hold for 2-3 minutes.  At that point I gave up. About an hour later I called again to try to place the order, and the phone just rang for the 8 minutes it took me to drive to the restaurant ( no one ever answered). I placed the to go order in person, paid for it, and waited about 20 minutes, then asked someone to check on my order. I brought it home, and the Traditional meal that I'd ordered for my husband had a tiny tablespoon of eggs (was supposed to be 2 scrambled eggs), no English muffin, the wrong sausages, and a tiny scoop of potatoes. Totally disappointing meal for his Father's Day, he wouldn't even eat it. So sad to see this once great, reliable restaurant go downhill so fast. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty boring food with not a lot of flavor.  I had an omelette that had very little filling.  The service is extremely friendly, though.  Good for kids."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more from First Watch after my mother raved about this place. My boyfriend and I decided to get brunch around 1pm on a Tuesday. We walked in and the restaurant was fairly dead. No one greeted us and we then stood around at the front for five minutes, along with another lady, before being addressed. No one said \"hello be right with you\" and no one apologized for keeping us waiting. I work at a high traffic brunch spot and we ALWAYS find time to acknowledge guests who walk into the restaurant.   We were taken to our seats by a very spacey, awkward server. He seemed flustered, not in an overwhelmed way, but just completely unsure. We asked to sit outside and after being seated the guy says \"your server will be right with you.\" Moments after he returns and says \"looks like ill be taking care of you, the other server didn't want the table.\" It was so uncomfortable and just a weird thing to say.   He was extremely slow on getting our drinks and by the time we ordered food, we had already been at the restaurant for 20minutes!! I placed my order, asking if it were possible to receive one pancake instead of a full order. Again, our server seemed confused, but said it was doable. I then also ordered a 1/2 ham & gruyere sandwich 1/2 cobb salad combo. I asked for no blue cheese in the salad. After the server went to put our order in, he runs outside to tell me that blue cheese doesn't come in my salad, but instead feta does.   When my food comes out, the server had rang us up for TWO pancakes and the wrong salad. He wasn't the one who delivered our food and never came by to check on us. Other tables were given condiment baskets, we were not. I was so hungry i just ate the salad given to me. I dont like black beans or avocado, so it was disappointing that i had to pick my way through that.   The server finally returned, drops our check and walks away. Never came back. I had to go inside to ask for a box. When i went to check out, I mentioned to the girl taking the payment that majority of my order was wrong. She had no sympathy or concern, and her reply was \"oh he's training\". IF HE'S TRAINING, WHY IS HE SERVING ALONE.   My \"one\" pancake costed the same amount for the 1/2 and 1/2 combo which was just totally unacceptable. The original price was $9 and only $2 was deducted to get one pancake??  Im really disappointed in this experience for several reasons. I bust my butt to give excellent customer service when I serve, so what i received today was just embarrassing. These servers are the reason that customers don't take waiters seriously and treat us like garbage. From working in the food industry I know that its not an easy job, so I try to be patient when things aren't great, but this was unreasonable.   Management should have apologized and either fixed the error or discounted my ticket for food i didn't even order. Not to mention, Management just needs to be present as a whole! Not once did I see a manager. But i saw two servers sitting in a booth chatting. Someone should also be training better. This was totally unacceptable and overpriced.   The food was good so i gave this place 2 stars, but the experience was horrendous.   Oh yeah, and i got bird crap all over the back of my arm and hand because no one wiped down their outside chairs!!"}
{"text":"After a loss in the family, my sister and I were staying across the street from this spot at the Home2 Suites and ended up eating here practically every morning.  We started out going to Totin's, but the portions were out of control and the food was too greasy.  We both live in Los Angeles, which is a breakfast/brunch haven, and First Watch would definitely hold its own in La La Land.  We were able to get a table very easily on weekday mornings and on the weekend you can get on the waitlist ahead of arrival through Yelp.  The wait can be long on the weekend, so I highly recommend using the Yelp waitlist function.  Once you're checked in, you can watch your progress on the app as well.  Throughout our residency eating here six days in a row, we fell in love with the Market Skillet Hash, the Elevated Egg Sandwich, and the Chickichanga.  All of the food is super fresh and the breakfast potatoes are yummy.  We also really liked all of our servers - friendly and attentive.  We will be back when we're in town for the holidays!"}
{"text":"This has become the weekend breakfast place for our family. Clean and airy with lots of natural sunlight from big windows. If you don't like kids, stay away from this place, because it is definitely family oriented and always has lots of kids. The menu features good breakfast and lunch items, and they pride themselves on food being made fresh from scratch - no deep friers, no microwaves.     Our kids usually split a big blueberry pancake, which comes with sausage or bacon and fresh fruit. My wife and I more often than not get an omelette or some sort of skillet. The greek omelette with feta cheese, spinach, and cremini mushrooms is always good. And their veggie burger for lunch is also a good option. Prices are decent, with most items in the $6-$9 range.  If there's a down side, the portions could be a little bigger. We recently went to Marie Scrambler's, which is extremely similar to FirstWatch in every way - decor, atmosphere, menu, etc. and their portions were much bigger than FirstWatch."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. I wish someone would have asked how our meal was because I would have told them the bacado should have more than 2 tiny slices of avocado. Have u ever seen how much avocado they put on the avocado toast??  When asked if salad and toast were ok with it, I asked for potatoes, as the menu said and hubby asked for fruit bc he is gluten free. When the meals came out the salad was substituted and the toast remained for both of us. That means I'm served two sets of carbs and my gluten free hubby, gluten.  Why couldn't it have been clarified what was to be substituted? Service was lackluster. The server only came by once right when we received our meals and before we could even learn what we were served. No manager or anyone for that matter came by and asked how our meal was. The cashier refused to honor our filled up good egg punch card. The whole experience was disappointing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a joke...A couple who arrived before us had been waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes. There were two emplyees \"working:\" They left frustrated with the total lack of attention. We were next! Same results...wait....wait...wait. The employees saw us but never commented or said anything about being there as soon as possible. (Those folks were better suited working in a plant nursery.) Not alot of people skills with this group!!! Finally had one employee surface and take us to a seat. Waited for 10 minutes. Finally got a coffee. Waited another 5 minutes. Still no results. Got up and left. Told one of the emplyees about my frustration and he just said \"Okay. Sorry man.\" SAve your cash and go to a place that cares...This place will probably close by next year."}
{"text":"This LOCATION deserves no stars. It was my second time going to this location. The first trip was not great but did not Think much of it at that time. But it was a bad experience again today and truly Disappointing service!! Never coming back to this location. I had been to Macedonia location many times and that place will always be my favorite and it's also not too far from this place.  So it's not about first watch but it's about who runs the place. This location is certainly run by someone who does not know the ABC of hospitality and is successful only because people have not been to other locations and don't know what they are missing by coming to this location.  Today, after waiting for 45 minutes for a table( did not feel bad at all) we waited again for another 30 minutes for the food and the server never came to check if we needed anything. I asked for whole grain toast instead of English muffin but she did not pay attention and I still got English muffin on my plate. Our food was served by another server who never got us the syrup. I then asked a third server for the syrup but she left and never came back. Meanwhile our server never showed up even though she was extremely busy coming around my table and kept chatting with other customers. After my son finished one pancake, I got up from the chair and asked a fourth server for the syrup. He was the only one who seemed to care. But which breakfast place serves pancakes without the syrup??? And then even with reminders, does not care. After we were done eating the junk (there was no flavor in that food), finally our original server showed up and asked if we needed anything. Really!!! Now she comes. But Wait!!!! The best part is coming up next.  While paying, when I wrote on my receipt, \"disappointing service\"  for table 3, the cashier got upset, did not care, snatched the receipt from me and moved on. She did not even have the courtesy to ask me about my experience or even apologize and did not even make an eye contact. It is a big deal that a customer is writing something on the receipt. Since there is no dearth of good breakfast restaurants around Solon and also plenty of better first watch locations, I will not be coming back to this first watch location EVER!! I would rather cook at home.   NEVER GIVING THEM ANY BUSINESS AGAIN."}
{"text":"First time visit to First Watch, but definitely not the last.    I was very please with the healthy choices that are offered on the menu. The choices were plentiful and the friendly waitress said we could make any substitutions since every thing was prepared fresh.  Although there were brunch and lunch menu items offered, my husband and I opted for breakfast. The \"triathlete\" omelet (egg whites ) was perfectly prepared, and served with a bowl of fresh fruit. There are so many choices on the menu, I can't wait to go back.  Oh, and did I mention that the service is 5 star!  The cleanliness and friendliness was top notch.  Our meal came to us so quick after we ordered that I had to ask how many cooks were in the kitchen.  The waitress smiled then  said three and then said that they strive to get your meal to the table with in 10 minutes from the time you order."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We came for a late breakfast around 1230 on a Sunday and waited to be seated for about 25 minutes. We were so indecisive about what to order that we both got a meal, millionaires bacon and a carrot cake pancake to split. My husband had the chickiChanga, and I had an omelette. Everything was delicious....we had to be rolled out of there! We can't wait to go back and try more. We would've given this place five stars but it did take quite a while to receive our food, but service was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The servers are great, especially Tamara.  The service is very fast.  Our favorite breakfast place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there about six weeks ago. Sat on the patio. Silverware was dirty and had to wait at least 30 minutes for our meal. Food came to the table cold! They were not busy at all. Asked for clean silverware and again that took another 10 minutes and I finally got up and got my own. Definitely would not return!"}
{"text":"I love love love First Watch. I went today for Sunday brunch to catch up with a friend. I understand that they had a heavy flow of people coming in, but for some reason I felt very rushed today. This has never happened before which is why I am disappointed :( We get the hint, you come around once or twice and ask if we are ok, that's your way of saying we need to leave. But then the waiter took our water pitcher away...Well ok then. I look at FW as a place to have coffee and pancakes and conversation. This time was different. I've been there on a Sunday before and never felt rushed out. I will probably come back, but I was definitely not happy with today's experience. You may be crowded, but we are still paying customers."}
{"text":"Food was good, not outstanding but above average. Also above average in price and below average in value. The service was awful. 20 minutes to get a bowl of soup? My wife's pancakes got cold while we waited for a clean fork and syrup.   Not inclined to return."}
{"text":"Service is bad! We were ignored for 10 minutes before anyone even came by and then it took a long time to get our food - and the order came out wrong... Skip this one!"}
{"text":"Went for a morning breakfast date and it was pretty quiet. As we were leaving the restaurant was gaining a crowd though. The Parma Scramble was amazing- super flavorful. The Chickaranga was good but a little overhyped. Our server wasn't on top of things this time, but I've had better service there before."}
{"text":"This place does what it is supposed to do: feed people decent breakfast and lunch food.  They do that marvelously.  It's a nice place and is a quaint restaurant. I get the french toast.  It's solid."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a First Watch before and was craving some place different to have breakfast so I stopped in here. The decor is awful, I mean, really awful. It's all beige and feels dark inside.   The server brought me coffee and immediately asked me if I was ready to order. I needed a few minutes, like 2 minutes. I kept looking around for her but she was nowhere to be found. At least 10 minutes go by before I even see her again, and then she comes back to take my order. I decided on a \"savory crepe.\"  My food comes out and ew. The crepe wasn't a crepe, it was like a mixture of an omelette with pancake batter or something. It was real dry and chewy and showed no actual signs of being a crepe. The turkey is not deli turkey, more like, processed cube turkey. The potatoes were gross and had no flavor. The English muffin was cold, the butter wouldn't even melt.   Needless to say, I won't be returning. It's too expensive for gross breakfast food."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new place for breakfast and this fit the bill.  There are lots of windows so the atmosphere is bright and cheery. There were lots of fresh choices and that made us happy as well.  I got a skillet with potatoes,  avocado,  onion,  tomatoes and eggs. There were also two big slices of hearty bread,  jam and a little cup of fruit.  I was thrilled with the flavors and size of the portions.  My husband got biscuits and gravy and his only issue was that they weren't as hot as he would have liked. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 or 5 times since it opened and never had a bad experience. The menu has a lot of healthy options to chose from and I love the fresh juices! The food is always prepared well and the service is always good. They get busy but we never have to wait long to be seated or to get our meals.  The only downfall is parking because the lot is small but this is definitely a spot we will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Coffee is very good and they have a great healthy food selection.  service is good and prices are too!  would recomend this as a great breakfast place to try and return to!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you want a nice healthy meal in the morning, I definitely recommend hitting this place up.  They have a friendly staff and a lot to choose from on the menu.  Only negative is be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes on the weekend for a table."}
{"text":"Genuine friendliness and accommodation, even when I arrived 10 minutes before closing time. AND good food. Will definitely stop in again, when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing special. I got a veggie scramble. Very overpriced for what you get. Service was okay. Food did not come out together since we were told the pancakes were falling apart. Small portions for the price. I miss Good Egg the food was much better when it was the Good Egg. I miss the egg crepes. Probably won't be back unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"First off I've got to say this has been one of the most excellent breakfast/lunch experiences I've ever had. They have something for everyone whether you want a traditional breakfast, a quick mid morning snack, or something you've never tried before. Don't be afraid to try a new dish here, they execute them very well with a multitude of modifications to choose from. So far the pot roast hash has been excellent and a perfect example of a dish I have never tried before. The Eggs Benedict are also very good, makes me excited to try a lot of their other meals they offer like their multi-grain pancakes and quinoa bowls.         The environment is very warm and inviting, and the servers are excellent as they always ask if you need anything else with your meal. Make sure to tip them well, they have great customer service skills and very helpful, especially when it's your first time you visit. I'm happy to say I have found my breakfast/lunch spot as a student of ASU."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast chain! What makes this particular location so amazing is their speed. I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table and that's including weekends and Sundays! The food variety is a little bit for everyone and there's no bad choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress brought water. Never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We asked for a minute to look over the menu, and 5 mins later she finally came back. It was another 20 mins before our food arrived.....cold. By then we were out of water. Employees standing around not doing talking. All that being said, the food itself was good, even if it was cold."}
{"text":"From 2 people greeting us to perfectly scrambled egg as a side, to a very good friendly waiter and very welcoming atmosphere--not to mention the Floridian French Toast- everything was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Wow, food was great, excellent quality and presentation was outstanding (watching too much food channel ). Why only 4 stars? prices are high. Staff was friendly. Definitely worth at least one visit then decide for yourself if the food matched the price. For me, there's so many other places to eat, I'll try someplace else next time."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Manager Jessica was very accommodating to our dining experience. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Your's truly puts this place to shame. Bad coffee and bland food...tastes prepackaged not fresh. Service was fast... But can't make up for bad food. Trifecta was mediocre and Eggs Benedict was horrible... Not even close to Inn on coventry's Eggs Mondo"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this restaurant.  We were looking for a good health conscious place that would have good options.  This place had both.  It had a comfortable down home country feel but sitting in the middle of the city.  The food was good and the young man that served us, made us feel right at home and thanked us for coming.  My husband and I were very satisfied and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service with delicious food.  Our last visit was more than 6 years ago.  Upon arriving, the brand new interior decoration was very uplifting and refreshing.  Completely different menu items to choose from.  Love the selections.  Have to return and try different dishes in the near future."}
{"text":"Service very slow dirty glasses on table waiting over 25 mins for half sandwich and salad not busy at all was hoping for a health breakfast or lunch making me late for work"}
{"text":"We ate here because it was across the street from St. Joseph's hospital where our baby was in intensive care. Had the Parma Hash. It was amazing!!! I love the server Tomara! She has an awesome personality. She noticed my hospital bracelet and we told her about our baby and she was sweet enough to say a prayer for him. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It has a friendly happy environment."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwich on the brioche bun and potatoes. Can't wait to try the eggs Benedict. My new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The dishes were dirty and water. Really nasty. Please wash the dishes carefully. It's dangerous to not do so due to bacteria and to think over 100+ people drink out of a cup that is not even washed well."}
{"text":"The service is amazing as well as the food. Everything I have tried so far has been perfected in taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Delish breakfast for after church. Helpful and and friendly staff. Complementary coffee is a nice addition when waiting to be seated. Would suggest getting the Avocado toast---to die for."}
{"text":"This place has great choices for healthy food. It's very neat and clean inside and the service was very quick. We had a group of 12 people and they sat us promptly and the food came just as fast. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food excellent. Only issue on the Mexican themed chickichanga there was no cilantro and none available from the kitchen.  Very good food just a little pricey."}
{"text":"This is the worst breakfast place i have ever been to!!  They changed all these over from The Good Egg to First Watch.  They should have just closed this one up like the derelict grocery store sitting next to it.    It was jam packed and I have no idea why except for it was mostly older people who must not know better and there aren't a lot of other choices in this part of town.  However I think Denny's is even better than this place.  First off, this chain has a lot of 'odd' menu choices.  I think they market it as healthy or unique but I just call it odd.  You won't find anything like a Rooty Tooty here!!  :(  So beyond that which is just my personal taste, my food was cold and the service was horrible.  Waitress only came once, never brought water, ignored us the whole time until she dropped off the bill.  The waffle was cold, the eggs were cold.  The scrambled eggs are not scrambled at all, more like 'mixed up' fried eggs.  GROSS   It was also supposed to be 'two eggs', well it looked more like half an egg.  Literally the smallest portion of eggs i have ever seen in a restaurant.  I thought maybe i got the child's menu item by mistake.  All around disgusted with this place.  Go to Butters, Butterfields, or any other place which would for sure be better than this.  CLOSE IT DOWN."}
{"text":"Just average.  Service was acceptable, though the food was not served hot and seemed too expensive for the portion/ingredients."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a tasty and healthy breakfast. The menu is exhaustive and has something for everyone. They always have outstanding specials of the day. I like the multigrain croissant egg sandwich...delicious. The chai seed power breakfast pudding bowl with fresh fruit and granola is outrageously scrumptious. This place quickly became one of my favorite spots. Only downside is the hours of operation; I wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I went in during the Childeren's Hospital fundraiser weekend and the food was phenomenal. The decor was great as well as the service.   I rated so low because while I was there with a friend for lunch we were appalled by what I'm assuming were trainers for the servers since they had just opened. We were there for a while so we got to see quite a showing. The trainers would stand with or behind our server. They would critique the server's performance while still standing at our table. It was incredibly awkward for my friend and I, as well as other customers. We didn't notice anything wrong with the service provided either. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable when we asked questions. The trainers would consistently nitpick about this or that. Not too kindly either... Honestly it was making my friend and I anxious that WE would say something wrong. I just can't support a company that treats it's employees the way we saw when they were only two days into opening... I would have rated one star for all the disrespect we saw in the hour and a half we were there, but the food really was delicious. If you do end up going: the Chickichanga, Biscuits and Gravy, and Kale Tonic are all delicious. Don't forget to tip the servers well! These people definitely deserve it!"}
{"text":"Great local eatery with a plethora of breakfast and brunch options. The restaurant is clean and the staff is extremely helpful. A big shout out to the server Ian for truly making my brunch a memorable experience. I will definitely be returning time and time again."}
{"text":"This is is the second time I have been to this restaurant with my Mother and had a terrible experience. The first  time the food was cold so we decided to give them a 2nd try and yesterday we went and when we were seated the waitress brought us water. The glass water container had something floating in it. So we asked for another one. Then we ordered our food and after waiting at least 40 minutes and the waitress never returning to our table I stopped her on the way to the kitchen and asked her where our food was and she said \" I don't know I'll let them know\" Really? So I walked up to the kitchen and the two waitresses were frantically looking for our order. I asked them what happened and they said they lost our order. I told them forget it as I had an appointment for my Mother.  They offered us to go drinks. We were drinking water. We have never been disappointed with the service or food at the Scottsdale and Thunderbird location and will not be returning back to this location again. Jackie"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a friend today and had a wonderful experience. Angie our server was attentive and made sure all our needs were met. I ordered the trifecta and requested extra crispy bacon and Angie made sure my order was correct. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just moved into offices nearby, and very happy to find this gem less than a block away. Even in 115 degree heat Saturday morning, a 20 minute wait!  Was worth it. Expert service, and awesome menu and food. Everything seems to taste a little better there!  Will be back often. Kale based smoothie to start was excellent. Will be going back and trying their lunch this week. 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"The avocado toast and multi grain pancakes stole the show!!! This place is adorable and has fantastic food that doesn't even feel or taste like it's healthy for you! The staff was fast and super friendly and even though we had a large party we were easily accommodated. I highly recommend First Watch you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"We have consistently had good food and service for 5 years.  Last week after lunch I had a bout of Montezuma's revenge.  This week I ordered the same exact meal and beverage.  Went home and the same problem occurred.  1 hour later my husband was hit with same problem.  The only food item we both ordered was egg.    So going forward eggs are out for us when we visit First Watch. I did call the restaurant and was told perhaps I was allergic to wheat, since I had toast."}
{"text":"I was visiting Ohio last weekend, from New York State. When we found this place we were very excited to check it out! The place was clean and welcoming. The service was spot on and our food was amazing! We tried all three freshly made juices, which were wonderful. I had the chickichaunga and my boyfriend had the beef brisket skillet special. Everything was delicious and fresh. Also, very filling. If we had one of these back home, I would be there all the time. Next time we are in Ohio, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a common lunch place for my friend and I. Decent menu with different options. I go with the you pick two. Today I had italian wedding soup that was very good and half a turkey club. I would get both again. I have had the tomato basil soup before and it wasn't bad!  Prices aren't bad I paid $10 for soup and half a sandwich. Staff is friendly, however today our server forgot a few things that we asked for twice.   The place can get busy so sometimes you will have to wait."}
{"text":"Poor quality food for the price.  Our food came out cold on a morning that they were not busy.  The staff seems uncaring and cold as well.  I like First Watch as we have been to several in other cities, but this one is a poor example of that franchise."}
{"text":"Extremely disorganized hostess station. Seating everyone out or order. Kitchen was extremely backed up even though restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Second time here, the food is great and service is friendly and attentive. The only issue with this place would have to be the parking lot, it doesn't fit more than 10 cars and the set up is poorly designed so it's also hard to park. Perfect place if you are able to walk here since it is close to mill."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time so far but I definitely will be returning. Went with fiance on Friday morning around 9 AM and the place was near full. Very friendly staff and very reasonable price for breakfast. I'm a big coffee fan and they bring a water pitcher and a coffee thermos/pitcher to each individual table. They also have Cholula hot sauce on every table which is by far my favorite, especially for breakfast.  Service: Very friendly and efficient. No problems and did not witness anyone else in the restaurant having any issues.  Food: I have only had the Chickichanga which was excellent. Very flavorful and filling. The side of potatoes was also very well done. Nothing standard or cookie cutter about their flavors.  Hygiene: Tables were very clean and organized. The condiments were full and there were no drips all over the bottles like you see at dinners. Kitchen in the back is open and also appeared very clean. Cooking staff seemed to really enjoy their job.  Accessibility: Located in Crocker Park so parking is free and easy.  Only reason I did not give 5 starts is because I have only been there once and I need a place to stand the test of time before I go for the full five starts. However after a few more visits I see this place making the list.  IF YOU HAVENT BEEN....CHECK IT OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are bad reviews on this place! The food was super good and quick to get to our seats. My mom got the breakfast sandwich and I got the Floridian french toast. Both were very good.  Their coffee was also super tasty! The staff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was really quaint. Not too loud either. Overall very great experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food, waitress took water pitcher when half full and never returned with more. Hostess at register when paid upon leaving was extremely rude. Very overrated place."}
{"text":"This place has some guy running the front who is slow as molasses. It's a pain to get seated even when nobody is waiting and takes forever to pay. It's great that they hire the developmentally disabled, but please find them a job where they can function."}
{"text":"The Traditional Breakfast was served cold.  I'm fine with the \"clean\" and nutritious sales pitch, but only if the food tastes good.  This did not.  Sawdust bread, cold unseasoned potatoes."}
{"text":"Let me say first, I love First Watch and frequent the one on Happy Valley quite often. The Avocado Toast is my go too! Today I stopped at this location....wow, not what I'm used too. Food was good, service beyond bad. I have never left $0 tip, until today. The girl that sat me was friendly, downhill after that. It was after the lunch rush so nit a lot of folks there. It took more than ten minutes for someone to come to the table, he took my order, brought me coffee(after a wait), then he never came back. Someone else brought my food, never checked on me again. I sat for quite awhile waiting for my check, then finally went to the register, since my \"waiter\" was chatting with coworkers. He literally said, oops you caught us gossiping about coworkers. Wow.  Next time, I will make the drive to Happy Valley location."}
{"text":"I've come to this location twice and sat down for a significant time, without receiving any service at all. I typically go to the other location on frank loyd wright, where I always get amazing service. I hope with all the servers they had at this location, they could make time for everyone they sit down. I would hate to think I wasn't served for other reasons."}
{"text":"Always loved this location when it was The Good Egg. Since it became First Watch, we have been very disappointed.  The food is hit and miss, and so are the portions. Sometimes you actually get two eggs, sometimes not.  The breakfast potatoes were hard and lukewarm the last two visits. The service is usually good, but the older manager is awful.  He doesn't greet you, nor does he really want to help you. The waiter forgot to ring our coupon and the manager yelled at him in front of us. Very awkward. He was unable to credit my account, and said we could use the coupon the next visit even after the expiration. Not so.  Bring back The Good Egg!!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't even stay to eat here. My review is based solely on service. Upon arriving me and my friend entered trying to get seated. There was no clear hostess station so my friend walked to the cashier and said \"excuse me\". The cashier was an older lady with glasses. She was working on someone's bill. She didn't even acknowledge him, didn't even look up or anything. We waited a minute and he asked \"how long is the wait\". She put her finger up and said I'll be with you in a second. Still didn't even look up but then pointed us to the hostess and said she could help us. Mind you, the hostess saw us walk in, saw us ask the cashier about the wait l, and didn't acknowledge us either."}
{"text":"There is no better breakfast to be served in Phoenix. The menu has most of the old standbys as well as novel breakfast items. Service is fine, the portions are fresh, and the servings quite generous.       The atmosphere is American Diner, but unless you're trying to impress a business associate this should not be an issue - you can always go over to the Biltmore, spend twice as much, and eat the same food in smaller quantities.       I-17 on/off is easy, parking is more than adequate, and the neighborhood is all office buildings and motels.       Bottom line: First Watch is a safe choice for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here almost every Saturday. The wait staff are all friendly and recognize us. The service is fast, precise, and friendly. They talk to you just enough and leave you be once you're satisfied. I love the food and they are very accommodating for substitutions. I haven't tried everything because I've found the Farmhouse skillet is my favorite and I have a hard time trying anything else! But I have had the avocado toast as well and it's delicious (hard to mess up). They have simple ingredients, not a huge menu, and great coffee and juice. It's a really relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The menu pictures do not match what is served. Very disappointing. We ordered breakfast tacos and got scrabble eggs on open face corn tortilla with no topping on it. The egged were ok but presentation sucked."}
{"text":"So glad this changed from The Good Egg - I wasn't a fan...First Watch is my go-to for their healthy breakfast options. My favorite is the Triathlete Omelette with a side of fruit. Of course I have to coax whomever I'm with to share a banana granola pancake as well - they're excellent. Service was great. Welcome to the neighborhood First Watch, we'll be back."}
{"text":"We live near the lake but go to First Watch as a treat.. I think the food is excellent.  I have a suggestion to the owners- teach your waitresses to have an upbeat attitude.  The couple of times we have come for lunch, they seem so laid back and in no hurry and really need some coaching on being upbeat and personable. I lay this at the feet of the person who hires them."}
{"text":"We love First Watch! They do get extremely busy on the weekends and there can be a wait for seating, its not McDonalds folks! I'll admit that sometimes the food is better than others, but its always hot and fresh. Thy also have a good selection of healthy options too.  I love the dinnerware they use there does anyone know what brand they are??"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot hands down. This place is always very clean, mornings are usually busy but no one seems to mind the short wait. The service gets two thumbs up and their food is so delicious, fresh healthy breakfast choices NEVER A GREASY PLATE. Mhmm"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot for the entire family. Hands down my kids favorite place to eat. Food has been the same consistent delicious quality for over 12 years that we've eaten here at the new location and others."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places by my new house! I moved into the area and have grown to love their service, food quality, and atmosphere. Their chocolate chip pancakes are the best & they have great coffee. 10/10 breakfast!!"}
{"text":"The food is good here. The service is usually really good too. There are so many options but not much in the way of vegan options which is surprising since they seem to value fresh products. There is a breakfast that I piece together when we go there but it would be so nice if they just put a few vegan items on the menu. We will definitely keep going but that's my one piece of feedback to make them even better."}
{"text":"Food was good. I Like eating there and tried something different.  It appeared that the Eggs for the Eggs Benedict didn't go as well as the cook intended....so the eggs were partial eggs. Loved the Potatoes!  Will go back to my usual.  Breakfast Tacos are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I had the coconut milk and chia seed pudding power bowl. It was excellent and very filling. Very nice atmosphere. I like that we are seated and waited on rather than standing in line to order. Maybe an odd quirk but, I also love that coffee is served in a glass mug rather than paper or styrofoam! My new favorite breakfast spot on Mill!"}
{"text":"We hosted a business meeting at this location in their back room. When I stopped by yesterday to view the space they were completely flexible on room set up and suggested an arrangement that was perfect for our group. Today, Alan, the manager and our 2 servers, Carlos and Shelby, took the most excellent care of us. When we arrived, the room was completely set with coffee thermos' and water already on the tables. They promptly greeted us and took our orders. The kitchen rocked it out in no time and then our servers professionally delivered all the food. This could have been problematic given that some of our people had moved chairs yet Carlos and Shelby didn't miss a beat. Everyone loved their meal and our meeting was a huge success! Thank you to everyone who gave us such a phenomenal experience!"}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast many times.  Lunch only a few.  Great American food with speedy service and fair prices.   Only four stars because of the wait on the weekends which actually shows how good this place really is. Never been during the week but it would be a regular lunch destination if I worked downtown."}
{"text":"Not sure this is a good bet...there is something called a wait list where you can sign in from home and get seated BEFORE people who have already been waiting for 30 minutes!! Next time won't use the waitlist...I just won't go!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was great! I ordered hot tea, soup, potatoes and a veggie burger. Yum! Everyone was nice to me, especially the host Blake."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were tasty, but the service was horrible. We had a 15 minute wait for a table. While waiting, we noticed that at least 6 tables were empty. When we were seated, it took 10 minutes for our server to arrive at our table to take our orders. She promised to be \"right back\" with our drinks. After 10 minutes, she dropped off a small carafe of water (without ice), and we used the two baby-size glasses on the table to pour our water. We noticed that all the other tables that had water were in tall glasses with ice and lemon wedges, so we wondered about that. It took a full 45 minutes until the first of our two simple sandwiches arrived, the second arriving 2 minutes later. During this long wait the server never returned to the table (but breezed by at least a dozen times) to refill drinks. I had to flag her down to ask for a refill of our small carafe. With so many eateries that serve great food and provide real service, we decided that we would not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Blink and you'll miss this location. Humble signage and modest exterior do not give away the delishish homemade, organic yumminess inside this amazing establishment. After I visited, I called my husband to tell him proudly, \"I found our new breakfast spot\". Something we take very seriously in our house.  I was seated right away on the patio, I was in a hurry for lunch and I ordered half a salad and half sandwhich. Truth be told the mexican lime chicken salad was overdressed and very sour. The sandwhich was perfectly Parisian with ham, cheese and brioche melty-crispy goodness. The service was attentive and quick. Will take all my out of town guests here for breakfast because I spied every other diner enjoying big portions of brunch items my stomach was jealous of."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer mentioned Ihop and Denny's.  Right on.  Might as well mention LePeep and other bland, vanilla, overcrowded \"restaurants\" too.  All I will say is this: Until you've had a waitress dripping with sweat (Dripping!) deliver your food, you can't complain.  So, I guess we CAN complain.  Grow up...Go someplace real."}
{"text":"As a Carefree resident since 2003, I used to enjoy going to The Good Egg, now taken over by First Watch.  Friendly staff from before are all gone, service is horrible, staff seem to disappear with a promise to return, if you can afford to wait.  Biggest surprise...no hash browns for breakfast!  How can a breakfast and brunch place not have hash browns?  Yes, they have some potatoes but it isn't the same."}
{"text":"No wait, very clean, courteous staff. I started off with a Day Glow juice. Very good!  Had the market veggie omelette. I love the fresh vegetables that are ruff cut so you know what you are eating and large enough to to taste and enjoy each flavor. Pan cooked omelette not flat see through sheet of egg. Which I like a fluffy whole eggs. Very accommodating to my allergy needs.  I love the healthy whole food theme. We need more of this type of cooking!! Thank you for keep things real and not processed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food was really good. We go on our lunch hour. Service is a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Great menu.  I had the butternut squash and mushroom frittata and my BF had the pumpkin spice pancake special with eggs and sausage. A perfect pairing of Fall ingredients"}
{"text":"OMGSH!  THE (absolutely!) worst, most overpriced, C-O-L-D, super-small portions breakfast E-V-E-R!!  I'm Diabetic, so I requested sugar free syrup for my Waffle and he plopped this really cute, WARM bottle of syrup in front of me and I was THRILLED!  My friend then asked if that was the sugar free (??) and we disappointed to hear \"Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  I'll be right back\".  Here he comes with a cold, right off the shelf cheap plastic bottle of Smuckers you see EVERYWHERE. (I HATE that &%#@!)... and it was COLD.  Another big thrill.  Their great tasting syrup is served WARM, my Smuckers sugar free in a plastic bottle, COLD.  Then the waffle arrived with powdered sugar ALL OVER IT!!!  SWEET!  Yeah... diabet syrup on a sugar coated waffle.  Make sense to you??  My scrambled eggs were slightly cooler than room temp, as were the over-easy eggs my friends had.  My BACON!!!  I little broken section and one medium sized scrap... cold, hard and greasy to boot.  I had been looking forward to a high protein burst, so I ordered a side of Turkey sausage.  It arrived \"cold\".  Not \"cold\" as in left on a plate for a few too many minutes... C-O-L-D as in REFRIGERATED!!!!!!!!!!  My friend suggested I ask them to nuke it.  I said \"No.  I ordered a side of sausage (for like $4.59) and sausage that comes complete with grill marks and pan sear marks COMES HOT... not \"nuked\"!  They can throw it out after they take it off my stinkin bill!\"  My entire plate was either slightly below room temp or C-O-L-D.  My friends eggs were cold as well (as I already mentioned) and the \"Carrot Cake Pancake\" they ordered to share as a side was simply a buttermilk type pancake with a few shreds of carrots sprinkled over it as it cooked and a few raisins over it to complete a \"Carrot Cake pancake\"?!  We were all expecting something QUITE different.  Two tables on either side of us complained about cold eggs and burnt toast (and the guy held the toast up for everyone to see!) so I know we weren't the only ones to get cold food.  UNBELIEVABLE!  WHO SERVES REFRIGERATOR TEMP SAUSAGE AND CHARGES $4.50 FOR IT??????????  Our bill for three breakfasts and ONE (O-N-E!) coffee??  FORTY TWO DOLLARS PLUS TIP!!! You won't print this anyway, so it's just an exercise in frustration.  Once things digest, it'll all be over as will any further trips for bad, cold, small portion breakfasts from First Watch.  I'll warn those who show an interest!!!  NOT!  $42.00 bucks??  R-e-a-l-l-y."}
{"text":"First time here, I tried the avocado toast, it was very very good and fresh. Also the millionaires bacon was a great addition. Will definitely be coming here for more."}
{"text":"Had been going here since it was Good Egg and it's still great. Service is always exceptional and the food is consistently good. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"This place is super cute...great menu, very good coffee, friendly staff! Couldn't ask for much more from a breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Literally LOVE this place! My fav place the best service everyone is so sweet here! food is BOMB! Coffee BOMB!"}
{"text":"Had the Parm hash, with a Pecan Pancake. Hash was amazing, and was a large plate. Pancake was decent, but overall great breakfast spot. Great service."}
{"text":"Food was great, but server didn't great us luckily another waitress saw and got us drinks, then about five minutes later he came took the order and next time we saw him Is when he dropped off the check. Will be back just wish we sat in that girls area."}
{"text":"If I could give a 1/2 star I would. Donot wase your hard earned money.  Ate there this am two omelets at our table.  Neither had but a tablespoon of ingredients and was cold.  Potatoes cold. Bread highly buttered and the butter could not melt as toast was cold.  The only thing hot was the water for tea.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"Keeps getting worse and worse.  Used to order on the regular and today I remembered why I don't anymore.  1. The place smells super old. Don't know how to describe it, and I have a TERRIBLE sense of smell.  2. Ordered takeout, arrived and no one attended me for 7 minutes.  3. Finally, someone came but they couldn't figure out the system.  4. Then, they called for a manager and they couldn't figure out the system.  5. After 10 minutes, they finally figured it out.  6. Get back to the office and realize they completely messed up my order, but don't have time to back.  Not worth it, Scottsdale has too many great food places for this service!"}
{"text":"A hopeful four stars... Excellent food, just foodie enough for me but with \"normal\" options for husband and kids. I loved my chicken chimichanga burrito thing for breakfast- great flavor. Husband's pancakes were fluffy and delicious. And the ambiance is trendy and clean, very pleasant. A little higher on the price range than a diner or something, but I felt like the quality made it worth it.  But the service missed the boat on a few counts. They didn't bring syrup with the pancakes, then the server didn't come check on us for a long time, then took another five minutes to bring the requested syrup and butter. All told, the rest of the table was done eating before my husband got his syrup and got to eat his pancakes.  Second thing was that when he asked if he could add a second pancake to the Trifecta breakfast plate, the server said \"uh, yeah, sure, there'd just be, you know, an extra charge.\" Well we didn't nail down the cost and we should have, because the way they rang it up, it cost us 3.99  more! On the menu the difference between the single pancake plate and the two pancake plate was only a buck or two, so this was a rotten deal.   Overall, yes, I'm sure we will be back because it's convenient and the menu had many yummy looking options (as did the other tables I couldn't help rubbernecking). Maybe the service will get better."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and amazing. Inside was nice and clean as well as the restroom. Not only was our server amazing, so were the others. Also very accommodating if you have young children. I highly suggest the croquet special! This is my new spot!"}
{"text":"first visit here, pleasantly surprised. We rarely dine out as this area is lacking in good restaurants. It was a Sunday about noon and there was no wait. The server appeared immediately and checked on us frequently. We both ordered the Triathlete, a healthy egg white omelet with vegetables, salsa on the side, a fruit cup and a piece of whole grain toast. Good food, great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife really takes  other YELP reviews seriously.. so when she saw 5 stars galore, she knew we had to check this place out.  She's a  huge lover of  poached eggs, and Benedict   So I thought I would try a salmon Benedict, too. And it did not disappoint. She had the Benedict Florentine, would she really enjoyed. Flavored creams are always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Love the  breakfasts here. The staff is very friendly and even helped me when I had lost a piece of jewelry!"}
{"text":"Waffle was soggy and undercooked. I ordered the waffle special and will not order that again. Bacon was burnt but a new order was OK. Bacon was not crisp but favorable according to my husband. They do not have much on menu for vegetarians. Also they tend to season with pepper in a lot of items."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! The hostess was rude when we entered and asked how long the wait was. We were sat outside on a dirty table with plastic bins to hold the cream and sugar. The same kind you could buy at a dollar store. The bins were broken and covered in old coffee and sugar that they were attracting flies. The food was not cooked properly. I ordered the the bacon and onion hash. Something I typically order and the potatoes were not cooked fully. My wife had the eggs Benedict and her eggs were not cooked properly. Then my wife went to the front counter to pay since we could not find our waitress to get our check. After the hostess swiped her card she then threw the bill at her and walked off. I couldn't believe it! Absolutely disgusting and ignorant behavior! First Watch is better than that."}
{"text":"Took me a little while to find, its not a stand alone building, rather hidden in with other stores and depending on the entrance you drive through the marquee may be hidden. Just watch for the patio seating and you'll find it faster than me. Enter by Cantina Laredo.   They were quick to welcome me and have me seated. Everyone was very friendly.  Food didn't take too long to get out.  I had a plain pancake, it wasn't anything special. I would recommend one of the other options.   Just a heads up, the pancakes are large. At about 8 inches in diameter, one pancake here is equivalent to two or so at other chain restaurants. If you want 4 pancakes, just order 2 here.   Overall it was a good breakfast, but nothing standout."}
{"text":"So happy they opened one in chandler!! This place is great for breakfast  I haven't tried their lunch yet but if it's anything like the breakfast I bet it's good. Excellent service and staff, the interior is perfect and cozy. The fresh juice is so delicious and tasty. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Don't forget the pancakes"}
{"text":"I had the trifecta it was delicious...I added a banana granola crunch pancake mmmm good! Try the day glow for an energizing drink. Treat yourself to the chicken salad melt, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was fine, because it was a busy Sunday morning. The food tasted fresh and it had great flavor. I had the egg sandwich and the fruit on the side was great. Fruit salad is usually honeydew/cantaloupe, but this one had strawberries, blackberries, and pineapple. I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This would be my second time visiting the First Watch Café. The first time I stopped in real quick and had avocado toast, which was good albeit simple. The fresh squeezed orange juice was good and a pretty good value. The visit made me want to come back and try a few other things when I had more time.  So today was the day. I took a later lunch since I worked through the normal hours. I got here about 130pm and the place was pretty empty (the place is bigger than it looks from the outside). I was seated immediately and the waiter pounced with coffee ready. As he poured the coffee I ordered a juice called \"Surprise and Shine\" which is watermelon, cucumber, lime, carrot and beet. The waiter said it tastes like water melon with earthiness. Sure, why not .. who doesn't need dirt every now and then! Maybe it will be like when I was a kid and dropped my watermelon in the dirt but ate it anyways! Juice came in a few minutes and then I ordered up what I use as my yardstick for all breakfast places.. Eggs Benedict. Although they had the ham version with tomatoes, but I ordered without so it was more of the classic dish.  So here are my reviews of the items:  Coffee - I like my coffee like my women ... dark and bitter. The coffee passed that requirement and seemed above quality versus normal diner coffees. The waiter left a container of it on the table for quick refills.  Juice - I didn't really taste much of the watermelon. The beet flavor basically came out first with a hint of the cucumber and then the aftertaste was the earthiness ... or again dirt. I really am not sure if I liked it or not. The initial taste was great but then the dirty taste was off putting. I know some people love that taste (my wife for example) but it left me perplexed. Anyways, it was a good enough portion and I drank it all ... and it is good for me right?  Eggs Benedict - Instead of the Canadian bacon it had normal sammich meat ham, which still went well with the meal, but I thought I would mention that. The poached eggs were done perfectly to my liking, yolk nice and running and the egg firm, not hard or gooey. The Hollandaise sauce was very good. It had a nice buttery flavor, but it didn't make me feel as if my heart would stop. I only wish there would have been a bit more on top, but then maybe the meal wouldn't have been so light. The English muffin was a normal toasted English muffin. Nothing good or bad about that, and truthfully I would rather go with the classic then have them make something up ala Meat and Potatoes (which is still my least favorite restaurant ever.)  Side - The meal came with a side of potatoes. They were pretty simple, cubed, salt and pepper and a few onions and weren't soggy or crispy. They weren't my favorite potatoes, but they fit with the dish and didn't try to steal the show.  I would recommend this place, especially if you are into juices and lighter breakfast meals versus the local diners that try to give you a heart attack. Keep in mind they close at 230pm and only serve breakfast and lunch. Wait staff was friendly and efficient and the place was clean. The silverware was also nice ... you know heavier metal versus the flimsy stuff you get at some places."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in town. It is conveniently located in Crocker Park and is a popular kid-friendly restaurant.  Very busy on the weekends, reservations recommended."}
{"text":"After hearing their commercials for a couple of months, I decided to give them a try.   Food: SO fresh!! Apparently their catch phrase is, \"yeah, it's fresh,\" and I must say they lived up to that expectation during my visit. I ordered a seasonal frittata. It was excellent! I loved the assortment of squashes, mushrooms, and other vegetables. I also ordered a fresh green juice which was refreshing and chock full of vitamins.  Service: They get BUSY!! So be sure you have ample time to wait around before you go. While the wait was not long, it might be bothersome to the youngsters (and their parents!) So plan accordingly. My server was very friendly and attentive. Be sure to have some cash on you as bills are paid at the front of the establishment.   Ambience: Super cute, very modern/hipster vibe without being too snotty.  I liked that the water arrived in old glass milk bottles. It definitely added to the experience!  Final point: Don't go expecting a late lunch as the place closes at 2:30.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thank-you for building in my neighborhood! We have always loved your food. Now we are regulars, as we have been at other locations. I have tried a good portion of the breakfast menu and there are many good choices. As others have stated, the avocado toast is really worth a try.  Waffle and pancakes, especially the specialties are tasty and fluffy. Bring back the egg in toast! Fun dish... The service is excellent. See Erin! She is very professional and accommodating."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is fast and friendly.  This was my first time at this location. And I was NOT disappointed, for a healthy change of pace, this diner is the best."}
{"text":"Our first visit--loved it and we'll be back.  The food was prepared exactly as ordered.  We love having a coffee pot on the table.  Overall, a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the Mesa area great food good service and wonderful Vibe I had the lemon pancakes they were cooked perfect I've been multiple times with the same results I highly recommend this place Don't forget the fresh squeezed OJ"}
{"text":"I volunteer for Foothills Caring Corps, an organization that helps over 1500 elderly locally to stay independent. Among other essential programs, we run a social program, and pick our neighbors up in our vans to transport them to fun excursions. Volunteers drive the vans, and there are assistants helping the elderly on an off , and in and out of their home and destination venue. We had avoided our First Watch locally for a year or so due to poor customer service, but decided to give it a try again. We spoke to the local assistant manager Brittany to make sure the reservation for 30 was ok, and were assured it would all go ahead as planned. . We had also spoken to Jennifer, a District Manager, and assured. Today I was HORRIFIED to hear from Amber, another assistant manager, that the reservation was no longer to be possible. This call happened as the 5 vans were picking up our neighbors for their much-anticipated breakfast with friends. These folks don't get out a lot, and our van program is a huge highlight in their week. Needless to say, a LOT of calls had to be made, a LOT of people were inconvenienced and the reputation of First Watch has sunk to a new low. I was not part of the disappointed group on their way to breakfast, but I am part of the volunteer group who were having a meeting when this fiasco was announced. I eagerly anticipate an apology for the Foothills Caring Corps, and until they receive one, I shall be vehement in spreading this negative news as far and as fast as I am able. I am appalled that any customer should be treated in this despicable fashion."}
{"text":"This is alcohol free zone but their juices are out of this place, I had kale tonic drink and it was delicious. I had veggie omelette with potatoes, tastes great and light. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the breakfast we ordered \"to go\" today. A side of fruit salad was literally a condiment size plastic side container filled with 5 slivers of fruit. It came with his \"chickichanga\" which was mediocre at best. My avocado toast was also disappointing as they did not package the eggs separately so when it was handled the yolk got all over my toast. I wasn't aware it came with eggs, which I HATE, so this actually ruined my entire meal. At most restaurants the person taking orders would have asked me how I wanted/like my eggs, which would have prompted me to inform him I don't like them at all to have avoided this problem completely. We likely will not be dining (in or out) here again after this major fail."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Only open for breakfast and lunch. Food taste fresh, good customer service.  This is one of my go-to breakfast places to take people from out of town."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great! It is always busy, so plan ahead on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad breakfast here. They have an awesome menu especially if you are trying to eat healthy + all the usual breakfast suspects."}
{"text":"the avocado toast and kale juice are amazing. best pancakes in town. they know how to poach an egg medium. service is always great, people are always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"First off, this place is a great location to most Hotels on Scottsdale Ave.   Negatives:  Upon arrival, the owner was not friendly.  The waitress that waited on me by the name of Kori was not friendly, and she did not know the menu when asked what she would suggest.   Upon receiving my food, the soup that I ordered was wrong and not hot.  And before I could take my first bite of my food the waitress dropped off the bill and never returned to see how I was doing.   Over all a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the biscuits and gravy and received something that looked like a hamburger bun with dinner gravy on top of it. Needless to say it is clear Firstwatch needs to research what \"biscuits and gravy\" truly entails. Sent my plate back and got the power wrap knowing that it's simple ingredients could not be up for interpretation. I also ordered the Nutella French toast which was made on a ciabatta bun... Once again I was let down by a dry soggy piece of bread with fruit sprinkled atop and an insufficient amount of Nutella. Wouldn't recommend eating here if you have any standard of breakfast foods -- would honestly rather eat at ihop or Denny's"}
{"text":"My family has been a few times and really liked the food so I decided to check it out as well. I;however, had the opposite experience. I ordered a ham & cheese omelet with onion, bell pepper, ham and cheese with a side of bacon. The omlet was so soggy and broke apart very easily. The potatoes were barely cooked and just a white mess in the plate. The bacon was cold and burnt in one end. I asked for extra jelly and the waitress never came back with it. When she did finally remember, I had already used some of my daughters so I didn't need it anymore. She apologized for not bringing the Jelly and I asked her for another Diet Coke? Guess what. That never came either. Finally we just got up to pay at the front. I was never asked if everything was okay. I was prepared to give my feedback but I guess they didn't really care to know. $44.00 I'll never get back. I would have given this 1 star but I really like the new modern atmosphere, the 12 grain toast and orange juice.  After receiving a nice note and gift card from the manager. We gave First Watch another try. My son enjoyed his meal and my omelet was so much better this time. Again, I really like the new atmosphere here. It's really nice to have the management care about the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast and lunch options. Most of which are on the healthy side. Friendly staff, quick service. Nice rotating seasonal specials."}
{"text":"Five for the banana pancake, but one or less for the turkey sausage.  FW under a previous regime used to have great chicken apple sausages, but these are dried up little awful things."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  And they had a table with a 110v with USB charge port built in !! Bonus ..  ;).  My waffle and eggs were perfect. I had the grapefruit juice for a drink and it was fresh squeezed.  Highly recommended.   The only down side , which isn't bad really,  is that I wish they would open earlier. Oh yeah , the Wifi didn't work when I tried it ( at least the open wifi labeled \" first watch open \" ). The prices are reasonable , good food overall ,  and they offer a a nice , bright , clean and open setting.   They also have a nice patio for casual outside dining.  Check it out ..."}
{"text":"This is our 5th visit and each time we try a new dish and everytime we are surprised how delicious and appealing they prepare it. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Remodeled, redesigned, completely new company...cage free, organic, gluten free...it is everything you wanted and more! What's more you ask???? Delicious food and amazing service. If you haven't been here yet...you have to try it."}
{"text":"The menu choices always look and sound so much better than they actually are. I feel They are a bit pricey for what you get and the service isn't stellar. Food is often like warm and no one really checks back if you need drink refills, etc. Every time I go, I'm a bit disappointed. It's not a bad place and it has great menu items and the food isn't bad - but it just doesn't live up to my expectations, thus the disappokntment"}
{"text":"As a Business Traveler, I am always looking for a great breakfast place. I am so sick of the middle of the road hotel free breakfasts. I usually do a search on my phone for \"Diners Near Me\" or \"Breakfast Near Me\". Well on this trip I was staying in Phoenix and did my typical search and First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy came up. As we all do we look at reviews and the menu. I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  The minute you walk in you feel the great friendly atmosphere. You are fine being a party of one without having to sit at the counter, like its a holiday and you have to sit at the kids table. The decor pulls you right in, the aroma is next and the friendly staff really make you feel welcome.  So if you are staying at the Spring Hill Suites, The Towne Place suites or even the Sheraton, do yourself a favor and walk a 1/4 mile up Frontage side of Black Canyon and have a great breakfast at First Watch.  BTW, try the Millionaire's Bacon. Let's call it dessert after your breakfast. Order it and you'll know why."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service. I ordered the Bacado Omelette and hubs ordered the Traditional Breakfast, we split a 2 stack plain pancake. Tasted homemade! Great atmosphere and value!"}
{"text":"I like FW...their food is pretty good, and I love that? they give you your own pot of coffee. Service isn't always as fast as I think it should? be. Will go back."}
{"text":"Good food, nice people but darn they are so expensive.  Eggs and bacon and tea, 2 servings of waffles coffee and tea 42 bucks."}
{"text":"At good places you wait. There is free coffee. The herbal hot tea  has many great selections for you to choose.. The Floridian French Toast was tasty . The seasoned potatoes were good and not greasy. Rae was an excellent server. The parking lot was filled. Not a problem. The beet, carrot, and kale drinks will be tried next time. Thumbs up here."}
{"text":"Why don't I think of First Watch more often? It would seem that this great breakfast place would be on my radar . . . it provides the quickie delicious breakfast without sacrificing service. I have been here at least a half-dozen times and I am never disappointed!    It was a fairly busy mid-morning on Sunday, but wait time was less then ten minutes. The actual size is much bigger than it looks from the outside.   Their omelets are a good size and they make them soft when I remember to ask. They made my husband's hard, as he always asks. The potatoes with sauteed onion are seasoned perfectly, and they both came with an English muffin - yum! Our server was friendly and very efficient -- we were in a hurry to get to Scottsdale Fashion Square!"}
{"text":"I've been a Good Egg regular for years. I saw the transition to First Watch happen slowly. The servers have always been friendly and efficient even thought the kitchen was a bit slow at times. I know right now they are getting a rash of complaints from regulars about the changes to the menu, so cut them some slack.   The decor change was okay as it was a bit outdated. The first big change was when the new manager came aboard. Prior to him there were a few who rotated, but all were friendly, mostly female, and greeted you with a smile when you arrived.  The new manager is an older man, short on customer service skills.   The menu changed gradually. A small group of us went one Saturday and our friend ordered biscuits and gravy, her favorite. She said it looked different and didn't taste good and mentioned this to our server, who suggested she tell the manager. She left most of it on her plate. She did mention it to the manager on her way out and he told her there was nothing he could do about that but if it made her feel better it was healthier for her.   On a later visit I ordered the Bacado omelet, that survived the transition to the new menu and was told it was served with fresh greens. My server was kind enough to let me know I could sub the traditional potatoes. When it was served without the side of salsa, I was told they didn't have salsa any more. Other small changes, like water without ice, removing the variety of jams for toast and serving their choice of jam in a small dish were other annoyances. Recently I stopped in early one morning on my way to work and found they had changed their opening time from 6:30 to 7:00 so I went elsewhere.   These folks have been in the business a long time and I'm certain they knew there would be a loss of some regulars when they finished the conversion to the First Watch menu. I don't go out for breakfast to eat healthy, I go out for comfort food. If I want healthy I'll have oatmeal, yogurt and fruit in my own kitchen. For most people breakfast is a treat and a break from cooking. As another reviewer said, it seems First Watch is catering to more of a yuppie crowd and leaving some of their regular customers behind. They may get enough new customers to replace those who go elsewhere, but I won't be among them."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious, fresh food. They have an extensive menu of healthy items, fresh juices from their juice bar, breakfast and lunch items. As other reviewers have said, their pancakes are HUGE and my bf and I split a nummy pecan one. We tried the tomato basil soup, chicken quinoa salad, breakfast combo with two eggs, turkey sausage and pancake. My friend got a healthy wrap and enjoyed it. The menu is affordable. Breakfast for the 3 of us was $33 plus tip.  The staff were wonderful and the food came out very quickly. Expect to wait on the weekends for a table.  Cons: I would have ordered a mimosa or bloody mary but alas, they don't have any alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Sara Jane is AMAZING. One of the best servers I've ever had! She was not only attentive and got my friends and I everything we wanted in a timely manner but she was also very kind and fun. Her up beat spirit definitely brightened my day! I have a hard time bringing my business to corporate restaurants due to the dull and robotic atmosphere that they often bring. Local places often give the kind of service and food I prefer but this experience at first watch was amazing! I will definitely be coming back in and telling my friends! Thanks Sara Jane!"}
{"text":"So, it's been over a year since my last review. First Watch is still an establishment with very good food and very good service however, the reduced portion sizes are still a regular occurrence. It is difficult to comprehend why the cheapest item to make (the rustic potatoes) are the item that seem to be served in the smallest portion. I have left still hungry and mildly perturbed a couple times in the past two months. I am a medium husky kind of guy and I used to rave about the food and how filling it was but, I no longer have such joy. I have only continued to patronize here due to influence from friends and family that enjoy the healthier option of food. The service is still very good but, a friendly reminder \"don't try to fix what wasn't broken\" . Quality and service are what brings people back, quantity helps as well!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed to see the good egg gone. New menu has no options for traditional breakfast. If you want only new age new fangled food go here. 26.00 two egg breakfast for two. Host asked several times how it was so i told him ok. He prodded some more so i said i liked it better before. He said we are getting a lot of that. Nuff said."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! . . the waitress was RUDE, the food TOOK FOREVER and was cold and when we asked for the manager, \"Larry\", he basically told us \"too bad and so sad\"!!!  Larry was BEYOND a JERK, to say the least . . DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!!!  Too many other GREAT places in the area to grab GREAT food, no reason to waste your $$ in a place that doesn't care about their customers, the quality of the food, or the attitude of their servers!!!"}
{"text":"The plates are big and a lot of food, I would go there again. It looks remodeled inside. The waiters and waitresses  are nice also."}
{"text":"Awesome find!  Power breakfast bowl is he bomb!  Quinoa sausage cage free eggs peppers mushrooms. Yummy.  Kids chocolate pancakes were huge and delish.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"I revisited this restaurant with my mom.  We both chose the Traditional Breakfast.  I had it with bacon and my mom had turkey sausage.  We both had coffee.  The Breakfast was good. I also wanted to try a slice of their french toast. The waiter told me that it would cost an additional 2.49 for one slice.  I passed since i could get an entire loaf for the same price. There was ample food so it was filling. The cost was $22 both of us which I thought was a bit pricey.  We did have a gift card. I would go again and try lunch."}
{"text":"This is a very good place and from the length of time we had to wait, others think so too.   We all ordered something different and everyone enjoyed the meal.    Also, two of us had the coffee and said it was good.  Not the wimpy stuff so many places pass off as coffee.   We are happy that some restaurants are trying hard to provide healthy food and not the run of the mill.   The server wasn't especially attentive but it was a very busy time.   He did finally bring water after we asked for it, but that's the only negative thing I can say about the place.  They have outdoor seating.  We certainly will encourage others to try it."}
{"text":"Checked in with the app and still were told there was a 30 minutes wait when we arrived. An hour and half later we still didn't have a table. Every time we checked they said \"30 more minutes\". Incredibly poor communication and no apologies. Obviously won't be recommending this spot."}
{"text":"Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The \"Bacado\". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service. Delicious."}
{"text":"The most undercooked potatoes I've ever had. They were still hard. And the ones that weren't were so squishy and gross. Not to mention the menu doesn't say the potatoes have onions. They do. Potatoes are my favorite part of breakfast and this was a big let down."}
{"text":"it's a healthy breakfast all day looking joint.  Remind me of sunrise cafe in Vegas.   very friendly service and prompt.  Definitely a good spot to go."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waited forever for food. Multiple errors in order and  burger was a hockey puck. Waitress had an attitude.  Asked to see manager.  He said \"we are having a bad day\", but never offered to comp anything.  We had to ask for comp. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food here at First Watch is quite good. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the service we've had here thus far. From the moment we sat down, our server really seemed less than enthusiastic to actually help us. She didn't introduce herself, dropped off our water, then walked away and barely said a word to us the whole time we were there. It got to the point where I was the one saying thank you to her for her service, just to see if she would even acknowledge us.  Needless to say, we didn't leave a very good tip. As someone who enjoys eating at different restaurants, there is a certain level of professionalism and customer service that I expect. A simple, \"Good morning and thanks for coming in\" from our waitress, Desma, would have been appreciated. Instead, it was almost as if she was upset that we were eating there to begin with. Good food.....poor service."}
{"text":"I got the farmers biscuit. This thing tamed an eight year craving I'd had for a great biscuit. I had a few extra sides and a cold brew coffee. My wife got a salad and some of their fusion drinks. All were well beyond our expectations.   I've been back since and it is consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since the switch from Good Egg. Other than the new interior there isn't much to say for it. The manager seemed grumpy. The waitress was slow  as molasses. We were desperate for drink refills. The food was cold by the time she ambled  out to serve us. Cold eggs are gross. How hard is it to serve hot eggs? I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I typically love First Watch and have had exceptional experiences, since 2000 when I started eating there. The location in Hilton Plaza however has let me down the last 2 visits. The food is pretty good, although my bacon was cold and limp the last visit. The biggest problem is the customer service. This restaurant seems to be chronically understaffed. Even with almost half the tables empty, our wait times were over 15 minutes. When I asked the hostess whether they were still understaffed, she acted as if I had grown a second head. I told her that in our previous visit we noticed and were informed that they were understaffed and it looked to be the situation this time.  Honesty, she had the personality of a rock and unless she was simply having a bad day, which could have been the situation, she should not be in customer service. I feel that I need to add that both times, the server was very good, even though they were running their butts off.  Based on my last two experiences, this last one was on my birthday, I may or may not be back. This is my closest location, but it may be prudent for me to travel to a different location. I do understand that this location was previously a different restaurant, The Good Egg, so maybe they inherited bad staffing. I don't know. That being said, I patronized The Good Egg when it was there once and my experience was good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy food that tastes pretty good, this is the place.  Staff is very nice and outgoing.  Kale smoothie was so good I got one to go."}
{"text":"Today we were lucky enough to be one of the first guests to try out this little gem! I have to say I am a breakfast snob, and am tough to impress, however, they succeeded with flying colors. The service was impeccable even considering it was a soft open training day. The chickichanga breakfast burrito was amazing. The coffee was fragrant and bold. I applaud these guys on a great start. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok I was very excited that a First Watch was opening near me.  We went several times and each time something was very wrong. Either the food was cold, very long waits but nothing matches this. I found something chewy in my food that turned out to be scraps of plastic. But then, cutting into it further revealed a four inch strip of plastic, like the pull top of a plastic bag.  I almost vomited right at the table. The manager never came over to my table, although we walked out right then. Since they have been around for some time  they cannot use true excuse of \"settling in\".   Do not go here or if you do inspect your food for debris!!!"}
{"text":"I received a mailer with a Buy one get one Free entree for First Watch and was completely impressed. So impressed, I went back the next day for brunch and order the exact same thing. YUMMY - my new favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Crusing around looking for a bathroom and something to eat... (cause and effect at it's worst) my mom didn't want to wait around for Original Hamburger Works to open, which sucks for me cuz I could just TASTE that burger!! :( oh well... we wound up going to First Watch... At first I was disappointed and then I was worried becuase that lil parking lot was FULL on a saturday late morning!   We came into their very busy foyer and got seated very quickly... which surprised me becuase I was like.... \"ummm what about the other 20 people waiting for a table?\" But whatev' all's fair love and good tables at resturants.   It took a LOOONG time for someone to even come up to us and ask for our drink order, but when we did - our waitress Sissy said she was brand spakin' new and was getting used to the ropes. I gotta admit, she was cool... she was patient and was willing to go ask the kitchen if the chicken salad had any onions in it... and it didn't btw - (yay!). So props for her on that. She even kept my mom's chickery spiced coffee aflowing and even got us some splenda for our drinks. I also  have to mention that nothing on that menu is over $10! Score!    Our food came and we were starved! I tore into my chicken salad and it was goooood... creamy, slightly sweet, nutty and chicken-y. I was in love. I wish it came with two pieces of toast instead of one, but I guess it's okay. The fruit salad was good, but I wish it were more seasonal... the maranated salad was okay too... a little too sweet for my taste. The potatos I had screamed onion powder! I tried to power through it but the taste was too strong. I couldn't finish it. My mom loved her spinach and tomato omlette and can't wait to try it again.   Over all, we had a good time in the multi colored dining room in the middle of downtown... I left happy and not bogged down by a huge meal, which was nice. *sigh* brunch... it's what's missing from my day.   To my yelpers: I say go. Atleast once. Go when you want what I call clean food... something nice that will sit well in your stomach and is a nice polite way to start the day... sooo not a good spot to nurse your hangover! lol! and don't worry about the loaded parking lot, just try it anyway and see what happens. you never know, you just might get seated right away like we were! :)"}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and effective and the food was really good. But it's definitely not going to fill you up. I got the quinoa bowl and paid I think $10.31 and I could have eaten three of them easy. But I made the mistake last time of ordering two entrees for $23 and didn't feel full. So next time I go there I will eat an appetizer at home before I go."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this specific First Watch location, but not our first to the restaurant chain. We have always received good service and the food has without fail been prepared with excellence. This specific location is nice because there is an outside patio seating area, as we do like to sit outside when the weather is nice, as it often is here in sunny Arizona! If you've never visited First Watch, I will tell you that they have a very healthy, and tasty menu, in addition to the usual staples you might expect. I do recommend them as a very positive dining experience!"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast earlier. Place was pretty busy...seated quickly and was surprised to see our food come out within 5 minutes of ordering. Food was hot and my kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes. Fresh squeezed orange juice was also refreshing. Would definitely recommend anyone to pay a visit."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Went once on a Sunday around 12p and we'll be back.  Service was fantastic and friendly.  Food was solid. We got an omelette, a quinoa power bowl, the kid's crepe, and a single blueberry pancake. All yummy."}
{"text":"The menu has a good variety but would love more vegetarian/vegan options. Staff has been friendly every time I went. Once I had a meal with fruit that had spoiled, but they fixed it and were very polite. Every other time I went everything was delicious. It's not very high quality, but it's a nice family spot for brunch. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I am so excited we found a delicious place near our home.  They have an amazing staff, and high quality of food.  Their menu will satisfy all taste buds.  Our first trip included the chocolate chip pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and a breakfast sandwich. Yum!  This is a local spot that I look forward to visiting regularly."}
{"text":"There aren't very many good breakfast places in Tempe, which makes the wait a little longer on the weekends for most of the popular destinations. This make First Watch is a nice addition, not only for providing more options, but for providing another good one. Although it is a chain, it beats more of the others. It is not the best breakfast in the area, but that is by a small margin. This place have some dedicated parking which is nice being so close to Mill Ave. It is another favorite in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and brunch spot. Well done decor creates a welcoming ambiance. Service is alright and food is very good with many healthy and unique options."}
{"text":"The ambiance is fine.  They seem to be going for this kind of retro industrial look that does not really work fort me, but it's open and bright.  The food is tolerable, but the real disappointment is the fresh juice bar.  I tried a beet juice concoction, and it actually tasted pretty good, what little there was of it.  It must have been two thirds ice. I asked the waitress about it because I felt so jipped and she explained that that was how they were instructed to make it."}
{"text":"This is a great place! The atmosphere is nice and dare I say, market hash is better then snooze's hash blends."}
{"text":"Tell the Chef to STOP OVER SALTING THE FOOD!! Potatoes and peanut butter bread sucks. There is a reason there is table salt at the tables."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Fulton Ranch location and it was a fantastic experience.  Great food & great service at reasonable prices...the ultimate recipe for success.  I had the roast beef sandwich with havarti cheese on parmesan crusted bread that was out-of-this-world fantastic.  My wife had the smoked brisket hash which she raved about, too.  This chain is a winner. Goodbye Good Egg - Hello First Watch!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant change from run of the mill breakfast places!  Creative, fresh and fun.  I had a lemon ricotta pancake that was big, fluffy and delicious.  Also got the brisket hash skillet which was on special and also delicious.  Everything was lightly salted and cooked well.  I liked that I left without feeling like I drank a cup of bacon grease. This is a good place to take your family!  It is clean and bright and the crowd is a bit more refined, no Dennys slobby whisky tango people stinking the place up.  Love it, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere..interesting menu that also has healthy options. The avocado toast is good..it's healthy so I can't say too much but it WAS good and my basted eggs were delicious. Coffee is amazingggg!! Service impeccable! I will return."}
{"text":"First Watch is consistently a great place to eat. The options are healthy AND delicious---a rare combo at other places. Always enjoy their fresh juices, especially the Spring Hydrate-so refreshing! 25 minute wait on Sunday afternoon, but they take your phone number and send you a text when your table's ready. Friendly and fast service. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I liked the egg sandwich I got but it was on such a small plate, I had no room to maneuver anything around which is kind of annoying. Service was fast and efficient - I would go back again. I like that you can pay at the counter when you're done."}
{"text":"We loved our visit at First Watch. Food is really good and healthy. The staff was so wonderful. Our interaction was with Nate who seated us and Amber who waited on us at our table. Nate was so friendly and helpful. He must be a real blessing to have as an employee. His enthusiasm and personality is extraordinary. We would come to the restaurant just because of Nate but fortunately we do not have to do that because everyone is so friendly. We also enjoyed having Amber wait on us and see was just a little bundle of joy. We will be back. We also like being able to put our name on the waiting list for a table using your mobile app."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it's usually great the food is great but the service is very disappointing. our waiter was very rude she rolled her eyes multiple times and took our drinks slammed them on the table. we talked to the manager and finally got a coffee. we ordered when we first ordered 3 employees where rude especially the hostess that ignored my family."}
{"text":"Good breakfast for the health conscious person.    They're remodeling inside and it looks fresh and new.    Eli, our server was fantastic!    I had the farmhouse skillet (eggs, avocado and bacon over home potatoes) and it was delicious.    Hubby had eggs with biscuits and gravy.   Great place!"}
{"text":"The food is ok.  It is all natural, but that does not mean low calorie.  It is also kinda of pricey."}
{"text":"I work nearby and go here all the time (at least once a week). The servers are really friendly, I love the breakfast & lunch options, and the food is always fresh. During peak times there is a wait, both to be seated and sometimes for your food, but nothing out of the ordinary. Probably not worth making a trip for but if you're in the area it's a solid option!"}
{"text":"Met a friend at First Watch in Scottsdale and loved the new design of the restaurant. I've visited First Watch at several locations in the Kansas City area and preferred the more modern look.  As always I had the avocado toast and scrambled eggs and it has always been consistently delicious in every location.  My friend had eggs, hash browns  and bacon and apparently loved it, as he ate every bite."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had a grilled roast beef sandwich and tomato soup. Sandwich was good except for the cheese on it wasn't melted at all. Soup was excellent."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day breakfast, because there was no wait, like there was at most restaurants on Mother's Day.  The service was great, and the food was wonderful!  My mom and I got the Belgian waffle with strawberry compote, strawberries and whipped cream on it, and it was to-die-for!  Lightly crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside.  Yummy!!  My daughter got the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were amazing, and my sister got Greek yogurt with chia seeds and assorted berries on top, which was also very yummy!  I can't wait to go back and try something different!  Everything was amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is always a good option and I've been here for breakfast, brunch and lunch. The service is always fast and everyone is always very friendly. I love their egg white omelets and their sandwiches are very large and come with fruit, their side salad and the First Watch Potatoes so you get an ample amount of food and the prices are really quite good considering you really do get two meals out of their portions. Their menu is pretty diverse and has some interesting options on it and they will make substitutions as you need or request. I also love that their nutrition information is on their website so you can make a better choice if you want, or just splurge.   It can get busy on weekends but it's a very nice little place to enjoy some good food at good prices and with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here for a healthy robust breakfast from time to time. I order one walnut oatmeal pancake with blueberries and an egg...you have to ask for the pure maple syrup though.  I really like that you can have decent coffee while you wait in line. The service is decent, just like the coffee. My 6 year old boy likes it too. Its kind of like a healthier, cleaned-up version of a west-coast IHOP :)"}
{"text":"This was the second visit to a First Watch, two different locations. Both visits have been totally pleasing. Wife had a different pancake dish each time and I had Biscuits and Turkey Gravy both times and we shared. Everything was good both visits and although two visits really aren't enough to effectively judge consistency, so far so good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I (and baby)  went here and really liked it. Great breakfast and they were accommodating with my baby. On par with pricing as far as breakfast places are concerned"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the pumpkin pancakes with sausage patty eggs applesauce and like always excellent service"}
{"text":"Bacado omelet was just ok. Service was certainly not the best. Had to flag down my waitress for hot coffee to many times."}
{"text":"The perfect place for breakfast/brunch, as the food and service are always great. Registered online and got in immediately when we arrived.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a Fantastic Restaurant! We spent Mother's Day here for breakfast. Because of the App, we were seated with less than 10 mins wait. Our server (Jordan) was Excellent. Management did a Great Job."}
{"text":"These guys need to better manage their seating process. Lots of waiting around when plenty of clean tables that are the right size are staring at us, and no one is being sat in them, yet many people on their wait list. Frustrating."}
{"text":"Just returned from breakfast at First Watch.  I admit I do miss the warm and cozy decor of the Good Egg.  New decor is the latest thing, but I prefer the ambiance of the Good Egg.  Well, change happens.  I ordered coffee and first pot was somewhat stale.  I mentioned this to the waitress, and she promptly brought a fresh pot of good coffee.  So that issue was resolved well.  I ordered a bacon omelet.  The omelets arrive with a salad, not potatoes.  This idea is fine and healthier, the greens are fresh.  However dressing used is vinaigrette and it has too much vinegar and is too sour to be enjoyed.  The real problem was with the eggs.  They were tough and rubbery.  Overcooked eggs should never be served in a breakfast place.  I did not finish that omelet.  I am tired of paying good money for simple meals, and then the food served is not properly cooked and not enjoyable!"}
{"text":"It was a Sumday morning and my wife and decided to try a new breakfast place and we were glad we did. Probably the place I've been to in long time and nearby where live in the Val Vista area. Wow ..what nice place. The environment was fresh and peaceful. The coffee was smooth not bitter at all.  I had the Chile Chorizo Omelette.  I was really expecting to be very spicy but it wasn't..just extremely flavorful.  I really don't remember what my wife had she going on and on about how she like it. The service was superb as well from the moment we got there and all the way til the end. The manager....I think her name was Linda but she circled the area through out the restaurant  ensuring that everyone had a great experience. All thumbs up from us. We will definitely be back and spread the word."}
{"text":"We have been two other first watch locations. This new one opened up at Carefree highway. I must say that I was not too pleased with the service. Everybody was really friendly however if you needed a refill you had to wait until the server may swing by and you had to ask her. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere is nice. We would go back again we just hope to have a little bit better service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food.  I had the avocado toast and my daughter had the turkey and avocado eggs Benedict  it and both were 10s!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience eating here. It's a really cute restaurant and very welcoming. I ordered the AM Superfoods Bowl and it was delicious. Very tasty and filling! It had coconut milk, chia seeds, bananas, berries, blackberry preserves and was topped with their own house made granola. It was very filling, I can't wait to go back and order this again. Also, it came with a side of peanut butter toast that was very good as well. Go try this place, yummm!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service, but the omelette was disappointing.  They did not use fresh cracked eggs.  Seemed like Pre-cooked egg part or even maybe some kind of artificial Egg pattie.  The ingredients were not mixed into the omelette.  They just sat inside the egg product.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It was recommended by a friend and they talked so highly about it, we came the next day. The lemon ricotta pancakes and avocado toast was absolutely delicious. Eric was a friendly server that loves the food himself so he was great for making personal recommendations for newbies. This is one of my new favorite places in all of Phoenix for breakfrast/brunch."}
{"text":"I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about but personally I love healthy and delicious food plus a good ambiance is always icing on the cake.  It's hard to really find good hearty breakfast around town, most places are far from Peoria. Servers are always pleasant and place is super clean.  General manager always greets you with a smile.  I look forward to this place all the time.  This place is always busy so if you plan on coming expect to wait a good 20 to 30 minutes. It's worth it! My favorite drink is the kale tonic no ice, pictures you see is what you will get."}
{"text":"Ok, after a response from the owner - reconsidered the amount of stars re rated it to 3 now. only due to the owern's response with reference to the bad service, an her great offer to correct the issue."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's relaxing yet fun. The staff is friendly, the food is amazing, and the iced coffee is some of the best I've ever had. I had the turkey sausage and gravy over biscuits and cleaned my plate. It was delicious! The prices are reasonable too. I'll definitly be coming back."}
{"text":"Been there twice for breakfast and I have enjoyed it. Stay away from the avocado because it is brown but everything else is fresh and light."}
{"text":"despite its crappy name (who names a restaurant First Watch?  It sounds like a homeland security issue) First Watch has some good eats for the first half of your day.  They're only open until 2 pm, so you know that the food they are offering has been well thought out for breakfast food.  They offer lunch foods as well, but if you're going to a restaurant specializing in good breakfast foods, why pass up that opportunity?  Apparently this place is always packed, especially on the weekends.  Despite the longer wait for brunch, the wait staff is efficient and attentive.  Our waitress was actually really cool, and probably the best server i've had in a long time.  the coffee is good (they even offer free coffee while you wait for a table), the service prompt, and my omelette with avacado and salsa was huge and filling.  they don't offer any \"brunch specials\" like a full time restaurant, since they only do breakfast and lunch.  but i do think they said they have daily specials..none of which include the big breakfast for cheap including an alcoholic beverage.  that must be a new york thing, which i'm sadly missing.  then again, an alcoholic beverage with brunch is a different type of brunch.  brunch here is like \"hey bubba, why don't you bring on down some more of those fresh eggs for makin' some tasty treats?\"  instead of \"you know what i heard about the lastest production of sven: the musical? ...pass me another mimosa...\"  different all together. apples and oranges.  though i like all kinds of fruit. um... too many places to take that.  so what i'm saying is..despite how this is an orange when i would like to have another apple, the orange was filling, satisfying, and enjoyable.  wow.  i have no idea how i pulled that one together.  but can you see all the places that could have gone???"}
{"text":"We had a mixup with our name being placed at the bottom of the wait list. The staff quickly corrected it and sat us.  The patio is clean, shaded and dog friendly!  The food was great and the potions were sizable and worth the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh, organic food served QUICK! Good choices and easy alterations to cater to my food allergies, and the staff is really friendly. My new breakfast go-to."}
{"text":"I work right next to this place and am here at least twice a week. They never disappoint and the staff is awesome.   I have been going here for over a year, but I felt the need to write a review today because I went with a huge group of coworkers and we all wanted seperate checks. Whenever I had done that anywhere else you can feel the tension from your waitress and even if they keep a smile you know deep down that they hate you for making that simple request that already knew was coming. Our waitress on the other hand brought it up right away since it was pretty clear and made it no big deal.   She must have heard us complaining about going back to work because she offered to go cups without us needing to ask. She also noticed that one of my coworkers barely touched his food and didn't want it to go. She was concerned and asked him if there was something wrong with it. He had no complaints, his eye were just bigger than his stomach and the meal wouldn't make good leftovers, but he enjoyed what ate and was happy with it. She didn't press any further, but showed that she was observant and cared about our dining experience.  I wish I got a copy of my receipt so I could remember her name because she deserves recognition, but she is short, thin, with a brown pixie cut and glasses."}
{"text":"Loved this! Came with my family and was blown away by the selection and quality. Service was excellent and atmosphere is great. Absolutely zero complaints. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot, and I come almost every weekend. The food is consistently good and the servers are friendly and prompt. However, things have declined over the last month. You have to wait a long time to get checked in and one of the people that check you acts like she's really bothered to have to do it or to seat you at all. I'm thinking of finding a new favorite weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"Delicious eggs benedict classic, with mixed greens on the side.  The hollandaise was yummy, with just the right amount of sauce(not drowning in it).  The eggs were poached just right.  The lemony/citrus sauce on the mixed greens was a little tart.  If I go again, I will ask for plain mixed greens to complement my eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Slow service and cold eggs is the order of the day at first watch.  I used to like this chain years ago but this location blows! Too many great breakfast places in Scottsdale for this location to survive.  That would explain the 15 minute wait on a Saturday morning when other places wait are longer than an hour."}
{"text":"Just returned from my first visit and will definitely return. We were greeted warmly at the door and shown to our table with menus immediately. I started with a Day Glow (a juice blend of carrot, orange, lemon and organic ginger). Delicious! Since I'm not an egg eater, I opted for a grilled ham, Gruyere and Dijon sandwich served with a mixed greens salad. Perfect! My husband couldn't decide which egg option he wanted, but settled on a turkey omelet, which he enjoyed. The omelets and frittatas sounded wonderful, and the breads are delicious. A great option from a traditional breakfast /brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, and enjoyable atmosphere! We got the lemon ricotta pancakes, the croissant frittata sandwich and an omelette and all were equally delicious!"}
{"text":"I received a 'buy one, get one free' coupon in the mail today from this restaurant. My dining experience the last time I was there was so abysmal, that even a free meal won't get me to go back-ever."}
{"text":"Great food! Always delicious and filling. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Let's be real - food tasted fine, but everything that should have plated hot to warm, was tepid. Serving size was a bit on the hungry side - yea, too small, esp for the $$. Service was slow, refills had to be asked for. The answer for improvement has to be in the kitchen. Warming lamps?  Staffing?"}
{"text":"First the short version: +top caliber fresh cuisine close to home +consistently great servers who give knowlegeable advice about menu selections, are attentive about checking in, offering prompt refills and ensuring fun A+ attention to all diners (they're all great but Greg is one of our favorites!) +a relaxing, casual, upbeat ambiance with indoor/outdoor options available including a community dining table.  If you want more, just go on over now.  You won't be dissappointed.     First Watch Arrowhead has been a favorite of our family's for the last couple of years. We had patronized this location when it used to be called The  Good Egg and were so excited to see the restaurant evolve into First Watch! We appreciate the variety, and freshness of the menu items as well as the changing, creative new seasonal combinations that are featured on the chalkboard each time we stop in.  The First Watch's healthy menu is highly appealing to all 4 different generations in our family and we have unique favorites, yet they constantly changing as we try out the new selections.        We came today to celebrate my husband's birthday and had a terrific waitress named Cierra.  We also were impressed with their change to Project Sunrise coffee grown by enterprising female coffee farmers in Guile, Columbia.  Delish!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Great healthy choices that taste better than we could have imagined.  Fast friendly service with great coffee and a clean atmosphere"}
{"text":"Heading for a late breakfast on Friday morning, we drove to the favorite place, the Good Egg, only to find out that it had changed to the First Watch. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  We had the Works and the Healthy Turkey omelettes.  Both were very tasty.  If you are looking for those big 3-egg omelettes, this is not the place, but you will get fresh, healthy food. We also had the Day Glow and Kale Tonic juice drinks.  Very refreshing. The service was great and our server was friendly.   We would come back again."}
{"text":"Great food. Healthy choices and quality food.  Try it out. Staff it's nice and they serve you well."}
{"text":"Very excellent breakfast! Liked the AM Superfoods Bowl a whole bunch! Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"Wow. This breakfast place used to be the good egg and they changed it. First Watch was beautifully decorated and the staff was incredibly friendly. The food was amazing. My wife and I started off with their freshly made juices. I had the ginger root and my wife had the glo which tasted like an orange side with carrots. Sounds funky but was delicious. We then had their raspberry walnut fresh baked muffin, butternut squash bisque, Floridian style French toast, and the elevated egg sandwich. These were all A++. This place is a must and I can't wait to bring my family."}
{"text":"Really bad service! Waited 15-20 minutes before someone came to our table to see what we wanted to drink. 45+ minutes before we got our food; that we ordered the same time when we ordered drinks. Once food was delivered our waitress walked away and we had no silverware! Couldn't find a waiter in sight so had to walk to the hostess to get some. Waiters must all hang out in the kitchen because you didn't really see them walking around checking on customers."}
{"text":"Finally, a healthy, tasty option in the area! The Market Hash was super fresh veggies with eggs and an English muffin with tasty strawberry jam. My mother got the muesli with yogurt and it was also very good. Everything was good and felt very healthy and energizing! I'll totally be back for brunch that makes you ready to start the day instead of ready for a nap."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I only made a yelp account just so I could leave this review haha. Went there today with my girlfriend and don't plan on going back. I got the tri athlete omelette. It was watery and filled with raw onions. The \"toast\" that it was served with was soggy and just not good. My girlfriend got the avocado toast which she was super excited for because she loves avocado toast. It was really upsetting. It was served with chives and parsley on top. My brother has been an executive chef in LA for 12 years and said that's not okay... haha! Plus my girlfriend is allergic to chives. So it would've been nice for it to say that on the menu that it was topped with it. Anyway, maybe we just went on a bad day but we don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I have been to this First Watch, and it did not disappoint. I went around 11 a.m. on a Saturday, so prime brunching time. However, we did not have to wait long at all - maybe 5 minutes for a booth. Our service was excellent, and our waitress was so attentive. We sat in the back corner in a booth, which I was grateful for because the tables near the front seemed to be getting the draft from the front door anytime anyone walked in. I ordered an iced tea, and my parents both ordered hot teas. They loved that they each had their own insulted coffee/tea thermos thing (not sure the correct word for it) to keep the water hot (not all restaurants give those). I had one of the special, the Huevos Rancheros Tostadas, which was so freaking amazing. If you have the chance to get it before the seasonal menu changes, I highly recommend it. Overall, it was a filling breakfast with my wonderful parents :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, clean establishment. I'd recommend it for breakfast, but go in knowing it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I usually like First Watch, but this location seems to be cutting corners when it comes to the freshness of their food. Both times I've been, my side order of fruit was rotting to the point it was smelling bad. I ordered a sandwich for lunch, and the bread was so dry it was either old and expired or it had been sitting out all day. It was supposed to be fresh bread, not toasted, and it was literally crumbling in my hands as I picked up my sandwich. I'm very discouraged because typically First Watch has good food, but I think this location is more concerned with saving money than serving quality. Sad"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a long weekend and just stumbled upon first watch for a breakfast spot.  Absolutely superb. Great fuel before a long day of hiking!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast options. A lot of healthier items to choose from. Not sure why the lower reviews but remember most of society is idiotic."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to go back today. We were pleasantly surprised. My husband had the traditional breakfast. The home style  potatoes were really good and the portion sizes were just right. I had the Monterey sandwich. The bread was a little dry, but overall was very good. The salad that came with it was very tasty. This experience was much better than the last time. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is easily our favorite brunch place. Before moving to NC we went to a First Watch in IN quite a bit. After our second visit to the Matthews location, it's clear that their wait system has flaws. We were quoted 30 minutes and waited over 45. The manager (can only assume he was a manager) was overheard telling one of the hostesses \"don't use the word 'hour' because people leave when they hear it.\" But that's what the wait was for many. Honesty goes a long way. Such a bummer for our favorite weekend place to lose a few points with us. The food is great, they just need to figure out how to successfully handle busy hours."}
{"text":"I was greeted and asked to wait not once, twice but three times by two employees. (I brushed my teeth, took a shower and had clean clothes on.) After waiting for five minutes I was shown to a table clear on the other side of the restaurant.   I had told the person I didn't need a menu, I usually get the same thing and was told Jared would be with me shortly.  (I frequented this establishment weekly). After being seated where no wait service was I noticed a woman being seated and was asked by the same person whom seated me if she would like something to drink.  Really?  Here I had been waiting for now 15 minutes and no one bothered to ask if I would have liked a drink?  OR how about helping me to feel welcome and comfortable? I had to leave.  How was I to expect a pleasant breakfast and start the day out on a positive note?"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went in for the first time and had lunch today and are loving this new option. The food and drinks were fresh and delicious! I had the kale, Fuji Apple, cucumber, and lemon drink and boy was it a pleasant surprise to love it so much that I will make this a regular energy drink for me when working. The sandwich was perfectly yummy and my butternut squash would have been if there would not have been sour cream and onion in it. Hubby had pumpkin spice pancake and we both fell in love with it!!!!! This place deserves a high rating on food!!!!! The people were friendly and the food did take longer than my lunch allows but we will just order ahead of time and be seated to eat and back to work on time in the future. You must try this place. The 2 sided menu offers a lot and it's healthy."}
{"text":"We were sat immediately upon arrival. Our waitress did pass our table a few times without greeting us or so much to say she would be right with us.   I got the Parma hash - it was pretty good. It had potatoes, turkey sausage, onions, tomatoe, all with a sunny side egg on top. It came with a small compote of fruit and an English muffin.   Our waitress was friendly and fun.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"This place was nice. It looks like they redid it. All the food was cooked good and as expected. Granted I didn't like my meal at all, but that was just my preference. I got the egg sandwich with avocado and brioche bun; it was prepared well, but it would've helped if I liked the stuff on it. Others got traditional breakfast. The bacon was good. I'd go back, but definitely not get the sandwich again."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm really impressed! I was having a tough day and was in between supply pick-ups for work when I decided to eat a quick meal at First Watch since I was in the neighborhood. The office I work for has used this location for special breakfast meetings for departments and sub-departments, so I was familiar with their food and service. I like how they've redecorated their restaurant.   However, today, I mentioned to the waitress that I was having a \"bad\" day. She said similar and that her birthday was \"tomorrow.\" I quickly ate my meal so I could hit the road and, when I asked her for the bill, she told me she paid for it! I was so surprised. I've heard of people paying it forward, but I've never had anyone pay my bill! Isn't that nice???   Thank you, Jontay! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, too!"}
{"text":"Dropping a star.  My grandma likes it, so I had to go there again.  It's basically a Denny's with higher prices and prides itself on tricking you into thinking it's a farm to table restaurant.  It's not.  There are many better places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Can food taste any more boring?  I guess it can.  At another First Watch location."}
{"text":"Just a really nice place for breakfast and the military discount makes it even better."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and there are so many choices! The BLT eggs benedict was so tasty! I really enjoyed the Kale tonic juice as well! Server was ok but no complaints of the food or portions. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Waitress was terrible.  Food was cold.  Sent back the first plate for being cold.  My husband was done with his breakfast by the time my second plate came out COLD. Very disappointing, had high expectations."}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee is delicious, Morning meditation is awesome. Fruit, yogurt and granola bowl was delicious. The ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this location for First Watch. For starters it has been here as long as I can remember. Secondly , I love the food! It is always fresh and hot. The service is wonderful as well. 3 of us came for lunch recently. About 1:20pm. Close to closing ,as they only serve Breakfast and Lunch here. Even though ,they seated us in a section they had already closed,(because, my friend wanted to seat there). I thought that was very nice of them. Our service was great and so was our food. Remember if you sign up on line at their website , they will give you coupons via email. Even a free meal for your Birthday. Parking can at times be a little tricky but, you should always be able to find something. Restrooms are always clean."}
{"text":"1st time visitor, I am a big fan!  The wait for a table when we arrived was 45 min.  but we happened to snag a couple of seats at the community table.  Such a great idea!  We spoke to some wonderful people while we waited for our food.  Million dollar bacon was worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious-Avocado toast, pumpkin pancake breakfast, carrot ginger chai juice, farmers biscuit sandwich, millionaires bacon...their seasonal menu is our go-to to order off of! Cant go wrong with anything you get"}
{"text":"My first time here today. I am excited about the new location going in next to Starbucks up at Portage Crossing. At first glance, this made an impression on me.  From the very organized and CLEAN condiments...including a nice dish of creamers to sugar in the raw--- everything was in order--- as all restaurants should aspire to be.  The waitress was kind of impersonable, which was fine.  But very sufficient.   Our food arrived very quickly considering they were at about 70%  Capacity to my observations.   I got the Florentine eggs benedict. It was very well presented and fresh. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly and actually  if I had to complain about anything, I thought the eggs were EXTREMELY tiny. I mean these were very very small eggs.  I would personally do a quick toss on the grill with the spinach,....... and maybe season it some....but that's just me. Perhaps idk the true tradition of this dish. I personally  think it would be more cohesive with a wilted spinach rather than raw. And definitely could have used a bit more hollandaise......as you can see in my pic. The ratio of egg&hollandaise to English muffin/spinach is quite different.  (Aka....they skimped on the good stuff) Seasoning goes as long way as well.   I also got a blueberry pancake and it was cooked perfectly. Again, the only observation I can see....is it appeared as if it wasn't made with a milk/buttermilk base.....and I can only tell that because of my culinary experience. I could be wrong . But I'm almost certain they use some water or possibly dry milk/water mixture in there somewhere.  It was a really nice experience. And to the  average Joe eating breakfast here...anyone would be impressed.   Only with my personal experience of food costs....I do agree with alot of the other yelpers  stating that the prices are on the high end of things. Not saying this is a bad thing.   I'm just making a statement.    I know how much a case of eggs cost from USFoods.... They are definitely making a profit here. $31 for 2 breakfasts. 1 coffee and 1 OJ is kinda steep..... But----  I will try something else upon a return visit or ask them to cook it and dress it to my specifications.....and see how much better it is------ however, i am excited about getting our own on this side of town!!!!!"}
{"text":"I still stand behind my review of this and the Fairlawn location.... Portions are small... my daughter brought me a Eggs Florentine for lunch.  If i weren't so hungry,  i would have taken a pic...  The eggs were barely the size of a silver dollar!!! I know. I know....freerange, organic...blah blah.... For $12... this prob had a food cost of $1.50 maximum............spinach,  2 slices of tomato,  1/3 of a half an avocado....hollandaise...   I wont go back...i know what theyre pulling here... no thank you.   You all keep paying the high prices...im done."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place with meals from the hearty to light and healthy. If you don't arrive early, expect to wait. This is a must go to when we are in town. One of the only places with breakfast specials. Guarantee you will not be disappointed regardless of whether you want a Southwest breakfast or light yogurt with fruit."}
{"text":"We tried to dine there. There was supposed to be was an hour wait. Gross underestimate, after more than an hour, we were told it would be at least another 30 minutes. With limited outdoor wait seating, the wait in the heat was too long, so we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice cosy breakfast and lunch place.  Very clean and pleasant to dine in.  Food is yummy; healthy options as well."}
{"text":"Had the lunch 2fer combo, turkey sandwich and pecan salad. Both were amazing. I added on a cup of tomato bisque that I used for dipping the sandwich in. Delish!   (:"}
{"text":"Two words... Never again!   I got an avocado chop to go today and it was hands down the worst salad. Not because of the ingredients but due to the soggy lettuce and stale tortilla strips. It's pretty obvious that a salad to go should have dressing on the side.  Was excited to give this place a try but definitely won't be back. Giving 2 stars only due to it being semi inexpensive."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I return to this restaurant. I have been several times and every time the service is horrible! I don't understand how an employee can think it's OK to not come check on you at all when you receive  your food and you're waiting for something to eat such as hot sauce and your server isn't even around to ask so you have to ask a random server. On top of that I went to pay my bill and there was a short line and someone was helping people and she helps 2 people I'm next in line and she walks away and starts cleaning tables leaving me in line standing there. The service is mediocre and I wish they never got rid of the Good Egg."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, great service!! I can't wait to come back. Second trip to this location and can't wait to come back!  Highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes and the BLTE.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday and miss The Good Egg - food was not good at all.  I would give it 'no' stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The food is to die for. Leave your wife at home, this is a place you bring your mom to.  She will love the food, but she will love you even more.  I recommend the Bacado or the Breakfast Tacos."}
{"text":"Fresh food made with the best ingredients. Always good service and food. Sometimes the wait can be like 10to15 minutes but it's totally worth it. Best breakfast in the northwest valley"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here a few times and it is always good. Everything tastes freshly made. They have really good oatmeal...I know that might sound strange but it comes with brown sugar and a 'wittle pitcher of milk, and there's cranberries, bananas and walnuts in the oatmeal. Ymm...trust me, this is coming from an eggs and sausage kind of guy. I tried one of their breakfast crepes once and it was different, but good. As a treat, we let my daughter have the chocolate chip pancake. Beware...your kid will want that every time. This is one of my standby breakfast spots because I always know what I'll get. Not five stars yet because I have not tried their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot in Tempe. Every time we come in we ask for Junior who provides impeccable service every time. The food is always fresh and you can tell it is not processed like some of the other breakfast restaurants such as IHOP. If you ever come to this location I would be sure and ask for Junior as he makes sure we are taken good care of. Additionally, the managers Hector and Jessica are always out interacting with guests which makes my family and I  feel like valued customers. Thanks for the amazing hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast this morning was delicious! The food is always fresh with lots of healthy choices, and the staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Unique spot here...has the feel of a cafe that would be inside of a mega church. Avocado, bacon and tomato hash ($10) was absolutely on point. Served piping hot and exploding with flavor.  Described as (Two eggs* any style atop a hash of fresh, seasoned potatoes, avocado, bacon and tomatoes with melted Cheddar and Monterey Jack) and it did not disappoint.  The key west crepeggs ($10) were described as: A thin crepe layered with eggs, turkey, avocado, bacon, tomatoes and Monterey Jack. Topped with sour cream and served with an English muffin, a side of housemade salsa and fresh, seasoned potatoes. Normally that doesn't sound like something I'd go for...however...when the dish came out it looked delicious...(the wife concurred)  This place has a distinct subtle style that finds it way into every facet of the dining experience...even down to the ikea-esque Classic milk delivery type bottles the water is served in."}
{"text":"End up here every time I'm in town (about a dozen or so times a year). The place has an open yet cozy feel. The younger servers are very friendly.  I am a coffee person but others in the group have gotten their morning tonics or juices and love the fresh ingredients.  The menu has a good selection and I try something new every time without being disappointed yet. Last time we failed to make a special request until the order had been in a bit but our waitress ran in to get it taken care of so all three orders came out together and hot (cold food is a major pet peeve)."}
{"text":"I, hubby and mini-me went there the other day. Not too bad of a wait time.  We weren't ready to order drinks or food and felt like we were punished for it. They weren't super busy yet. So I'm not sure what took so long take/get our order. They have good options for a kids meal. I shared with both my mini-me and husband since I wasn't that hungry. The eggs were good. My husband got an omelet called the Works Ham. It had bacon, sausage, house-roasted Crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Topped with all-natural sour cream. I wasn't a big fan. Eggs tasted dry and I didn't like the sour cream. Nice place to try but good luck waiting for water. Lol. Eventually, towards the end, our server was nice and helpful, then again, I was told I wear my emotions on my face lol, not sure if she picked up on my expressions.   *I'm waiting to come back to try other items on their menu before I change my ratings."}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth visit.  Today I must have ordered the wrong thing - Flavorless French Toast and crispy fat - served as bacon.  My breakfast was over $20 and should have been amazing, so disappointed.  I was happy with the service but the quality of food does not warrant the price.  Even if it was cheaper I wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, server was really nice but 40 minute wait for food to be served. The people next to me had 2 kids that became very crabby waiting 40 minutes for their meal also. I would return to give them a 2nd chance but that is too long of a wait for your food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Ohio. The staff is friendly and knows their menu. The menu has great variety---they have clean, somewhat healthy and whimisical options. But, you have to try the bacon cheddar pancake!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went there on Sunday.  Given, it was not busy, but the service was fast.  The food was fast. I guess the other reviewers were there at a busier time.  The food was great! I had a green juice and fruit/granola/yogurt bowl and my boyfriend had a roast beef sandwich.  He said it was one of the best roast beef sandwiches he's ever had. I am vegetarian and he is a meat eater, so it satisfies both of us."}
{"text":"The service was not very good. People got seated before my husband and I even though we were there first. It looks like Joanna Gaines puked all over. I got a chicken pecan salad that just made me sick to my stomach because it was smothered in what I can only describe as \"sticky goo dressing\". Additionally, the server asked how our food was afterward and I said it wasn't great and she just said \"OK\" and walked away. Wait...what? The sandwich my husband got was good which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars"}
{"text":"Well after coming here for over the past few years this will most likely be our last visit. We have tried another location with same results...cold food. I just do not understand how when you get the food it is no longer hot. I feel the quality of their food has gone down hill. I wish they would let me make their chicken salad because it is not good at all. They would sell out everyday if they tried mine. Waited over 25 minutes for breakfast today and everything was cold; toast didnt even melt the butter. This is the 4th time our food has been cold. The server stated they would pick up our check but that is not the goal here. I just want hot breakfast food, with everything i ask for. The owners need to have a meeting because quality is certainly falling short."}
{"text":"Worst eggs at a breakfast joint! I miss when it was the good egg. First watch is trying to do this \"hip\" new way of scrambling an egg which is them cracking the egg in the pan and moving it around a bit. It's not good and I've tried it more than once hoping it was a bad day! The service was great but the food was mediocre. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a yay I'm a fan because   1. their pancake selection is pretty great (cranberry nut, chocolate chip, banana, carrot cake, etc.)  2. they have STRONG coffee (I like that) and flavored creamer along with the regular half n half  3. the prices are not incredibly expensive (but it's also not $5.99 cheap status like Denny's -- YUCK)  The location kind of sucks because if you pass it, you're on a one way street and you have to either get creative in backtracking, or make a reeeeaaaaally bug circle back to the restuarant.  The waitress was not overly friendly, and didn't really joke around with us, which kind of sucks when you're in a diner-style place like that because that interaction really adds to the experience.  Will I go back? Probably yes. Do I recommend it? After The Place on Bell, yes. BAM"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place that makes a wonderful eggs benedict since recently relocating to Arizona from Maryland. I'd heard about how amazing this place was under the previous name so I decided to give it a try. However, I was quickly disappointed. The server was decent, but very quiet and not the most friendly. It seemed like he was just doing to bare minimum to get a tip, and whenever he stopped by the table he'd leave rather quickly - sometimes before we were even done talking. I'd gone with my boyfriend, and I of course ordered the classic eggs benedict while he ordered biscuits and gravy. But sadly since this appears to be more of a \"healthy and green\" restaurant, they seemed to focus more on making their food as healthy and fat free as possible, rather than flavorful and tasty. I'm sure it would be nicer for someone who is more into that lifestyle, but it just wasn't for us - we prefer our food to taste good, rather than worry about counting calories when we go out to eat. The food was rather bland and unsatisfying, and we left still feeling a bit hungry... not exactly what you'd want after paying for meal at a restaurant. We probably won't be back, and the search for an amazing eggs benedict continues."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful. We waited for over an hour and a half for our food to be served. The server tried to be nice and kept assuring us, \"you're food is the very next one.\" I watched 4 or 5 other tables get served their food after that statement was made to us. Food finally arrived and I could only muster 2 bites before I sent my food back. My works omelet tasted like fish and there's no fish in it. In a previous life I was an Italian cook and a sushi chef, so I'm appalled at how this place can even still be open. The other locations are much better. Go to the one on rural and ray instead! They have great customer service and their food turns out awesome every time. Maybe the manager of this location should talk with the one on rural to learn a thing or two."}
{"text":"We went for Fathers Day breakfast and everything was wonderful!!!!!!! The restaurant is very cute, polite staff, and our server was Brian and he was great!!! They had a Fathers Day menu so I'm not sure if this stuff is normally on the menu, but I ordered a Kale Tonic fresh juice that was absolutely delicious, and I ordered an Elevated Egg Sandwich that was perfect, and a chocolate chip pancake on the side!!!! All of our food was delicious and we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, my companion chose to try First Watch since it was a stone's throw from our hotel. We were not disappointed. The specialty juice drinks are delicious  (we sampled all 3) and the menu is rife with delectable descriptions of the food that hardly do the food justice. From tomato basil soup and half sandwiches to pancakes and stone-cut oatmeal we were taken with First Watch and due to the phenomenal service I expect it to be our \"First\" choice every time we visit!"}
{"text":"Arrived to a packed house on a Saturday, we were seated promptly on the \"porch\" which had opened garage doors for a more outside vibe. We ordered iced coffees and were served within 5 minutes.   Food came out fast as well! Service was great and food was really good!"}
{"text":"Really miss the Good Egg. It's way to fancy of a breakfast.  Didn't eat 3/4 of the items on my plate.  It took 35 mins to get our food. Avocado was completely brown. When it was the Good Egg it was like eating a home cooked meal. Now I feel it was like eating at an upscale restaurant.  Not impressed...."}
{"text":"You got lucky to stumble across this place. Excellent healthy breakfast options. I had the butternut squash and quinoa bowl and it was amazing! I wish we had one of these in Alaska."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Food was good. Service was AWFUL! There were four of us. Took awhile to get our food. When we did get our food only two of us got our meal. Then 5 minutes later the third person got their meal. I don't think the forth would have received her food at all if we had not flagged someone down to ask about it. When it did come the runner was VERY rude. We never saw our waitress after we ordered until it was time to get our check. It was busy and it is a new place. So hopefully they will work things out. But there is no excuse for rudeness."}
{"text":"Great space for chatting over a yummy breakfast. They have wonderful coffee and the avocado toast was delicious.  Service was great and unobtrusive.    I've eaten at other First Watches and they are always good."}
{"text":"This was our first time at First Watch. The focus is on fresh, ethical food. My husband and I shared the chickachanga and turkey sausage and biscuit breakfasts. They were flavorful and perfect portions. The price is higher as they serve healthier, cleaner food items."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix on7/1-7/4/16 and for 3 days in a row we came and ate here. The food was delicious and the service was great! If you are in the Phoenix area check out a First Watch, you won't be disappointed. Everything we tried was good!!!! Pancakes, waffles, bacon, skillet meals, chickichanga was awesome, everything that had avacado was awesome! Oh and the fresh juices was so refreshing for the hot weather outside. Loved it and will eat there again when visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, Arcadia atmosphere without the Arcadia wait.  At least for now.  I'm sure as good as this place is, it won't be long before its 1-2 hours to get in for breakfast.  Highly recommend the Chickichanga, absolutely delicious.  Their kale drink is really good too. It's a hidden away quiet place that's great for kids too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ate here fairly frequently when it was a good egg. It has recently changed completely to a First Watch and I have to say that the service is the only thing that is good here. The food went from okay to bad. Everything we used to get also went up in price. Maybe our waitresses just never charged us for substitutions we used to get before, I don't know, but it costs more and the food is much worse. We won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Could not dislike this place anymore than I do now. Have tried to come here twice to eat...1 they wouldn't honor the coupon they sent us in the mail and the 2nd time they won't allow dogs anywhere near their tables on the outside patio. There are very few, if any breakfast spots in Scottsdale that do not allow dogs on a patio since it is such a dog friendly city. Bad management and will never eat there again. Will never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"After being told our wait would only be 10 minutes. We were told it would be another 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes of waiting. I understand that the restaurant business is a tough business that can unexpectedly become busy but it's unexceptionable to leave 4 tables dirty and empty without cleaning them to seat your customers. Embarrassing. Edit: after going to the host stand 20 minutes after my aunt was told there were parties ahead of us.  I was then told there were 5 parties ahead of us? I don't know how that's possible after watching 3 tables get sit. I will never be back here. There are a lot of other establishments I would support before waiting for your extremely average breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff were pleasant and eager to make sure guests were happy. I had a frittata and customized it a bit to my taste with different veggie choices. It was well seasoned and delish. The fruit was tasty as was the toast. Prices are reasonable and in line with other restaurants in the area. There were many unique choices on the menu. I am looking forward to returning and trying the ciabata french toast with nutella."}
{"text":"The new decor is very bright and sunny. The First Watch menu offers some new dishes when compared with the more traditional Good Egg menu. Much more variety! My husband loved the Chilaquiles and really liked the new juice menu. I always have a great experience here when I bring the family for breakfast."}
{"text":"This location has a totally different and updated menu It's really great food Fresh and local This is not the old one notch above Denny's First watch Our server Erin was so charming and delightful ! And funny coffee was excellent I had the ham and gruyere cheese omelet made with egg white yummy !"}
{"text":"I came here with my mini. She loves their chocolate chip pancakes. However at this particular location, she was asking if there were chocolate chips in them. There were, but at the other location off 83rd Ave I believe, her pancakes are better.   I didn't really enjoy my carrot cake pancake. I love carrot cake and this recipe had almost no flavor. It could have used more sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla. I don't like things super sweet but there was almost no sugar in the recipe. The carrots themselves don't provide enough sweetness.   I didn't want to send it back because our waitress, don't know her name, was not that nice. She was friendlier to the older couple behind us. When a younger couple of friends came in, she treated them the same as us.   However, the millionaire's bacon is quite yummy. It was a bit greasy, but it has brown sugar I believe, cayenne, black pepper and maple syrup. It was sweet, spicy & savory. If you like bacon, treat yourself."}
{"text":"I went in to get breakfast to go. The staff was very friendly. I asked how one of their specialty drinks was, and they let me sample it. I bought two elevated egg sandwiches and kids chocolate chip pancake. The elevated egg sandwich was very good. It had mayo, which normally I don't get on sandwiches because people don't know what \"go easy on the mayo\" means. However, it was delicious. The it has crispy bacon, egg, avocado & gruyere cheese on a brioche bun with arugula. The arugula added a slight peppery flavor, which was complemented by the creamy avocado, and bacon goodness. The bun was rich but not dense and was just lovely. I can't wait to eat it again. The potatoes really lacked flavor. They weren't salted, which is fine by me because I don't like tons of salt. But I did need to load them up with pepper, and dip them in ketchup & sriracha. They were with sautéed onions. They weren't as crunchy as I would have liked.  Melon cooler: very sweet, but the flavors are subtly complex behind the sweetness. It would be amazing with some vodka. I would definitely drink this again. It's made with honeydew, which not many drinks I've found are made with. If you like honeydew, you'll LOVE this drink. It was $3.99 when I went.   Kids chocolate chip pancake: It comes with either bacon or sausage and a drink.  It's very large, fluffy pancake. It's basically how you would want a good pancake to taste, the batter isn't overly sweet, but is just barely sweet. The chocolate was good quality and my daughter loved it. She loved the sausage the most.   The atmosphere was warm & friendly with very cute decor. My daughter wanted to sit down and eat there.   Overall, this place is very good. We will be back sometime, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I put in my table request about 45 minutes before my suggested arrival. Upon arrival, the manager said, \"I'll be honest with you, we have like 5 tables that have more people that take precedence over your spot in line.\" So, I left.  Here's a note to First Watch, customer service goes a long way and your manager was rude and condescending.  I will not be going back to First Watch and will be sure to let everyone I know about my experience."}
{"text":"Such poor service. I don't mind the wait to be seated but the attitude of the millennial hostess is poor bordering on rude. She says 10 more minutes but 15 minutes later we continue to look at an open table outside; actually 2 open tables. And more attitude when we ask what is happening with the outside open tables. I would not recommend this First Watch location. Have never waited so long and with such poor interactions. Food was good. If service team was properly trained would offer a better experience.  Thanks to Rebecca L for the follow up after my post describing my poor experience at First Watch. The follow up from the customer service team was both appreciated and very professional. We will definitely give First Watch another try and again thank you for acknowledging my experience."}
{"text":"The Phoenix location is up the street from our church so this is typically our Sunday brunch. The prices are great for the delicious and filling meals. Our servers are always beyond friendly.. we always look forward to trying the new dishes on the seasonal menus!"}
{"text":"Super Seed Protien Pancakes are delicious and loved they had gluten free options on their menu also. Atmosphere is a rustic farm look. I'll be back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"I had not gone there since it was The Good Egg! It was so much better! I liked the decor and the good was great. Between the 4 of us we tried several things.  ALL delicious.  Blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy,  egg white omelette, avocado toast, and bacon. The only thing I didn't like was the COLD bacon. I understand they cook it earlier in the day but always throw it on the griddle before serving it. This is my opinion. Service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! 1st time and I enjoyed their fresh n light meals. My gf order the Belgian Waffles with a side of eggs n turkey sasagues and I order their Bacado Omelet with a side of potatoes and English Muffin. The Waiter's are very kind and knowledgeable plus they clearly state all option (very flexible&multiple choices). Definitely coming back and hoping to share with family and friends ;)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! They have a great selection of of healthy, sweet, and savory options. The only way this place could be better is if they had mimosas!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible!! I got the AM Superfood Bowl and everything was perfect. The only reason I'm giving this review 4/5 stars is because we requested to sit outside and the hostess sat groups of people before us (who put in reservations after us), and we were not able to get an outdoor table. Our waitress was wonderful- the hostess was not."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast grub, but a more expensive than it's ambience or location justifies.  Probably not worth waiting in the Sunday brunch line for this place...  Service was minimal with the check plopped on the table halfway through the meal and the staff attempting to take the plates before we were done eating.  It was a busy time, of course, but we were seated for less than 30 minutes and felt rushed out.  I'd have preferred Waffle House."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant are VERY rude. I gave this place 3 chances just to be fair, but they failed all three times.  The food is okay, but over priced."}
{"text":"Went here with my fellow classmates for some brunch in between classes. It was my first time there and I had never heard of this restaurant before, but I am so glad that I stopped in for a bite to eat! Our server was very accommodating of our short break and made sure to get our orders out as fast as possible. All of the orders were accurate and they were brought out within 10 minutes. The food is extremely fresh and it is clear that this establishment cares about the health of their customers. Each of the dishes on their menu were healthy options and alternatives as opposed to going somewhere such as Denny's or IHOP and getting low-grade food. I will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Over priced pretentious white people food. Staff has an attitude problem(particularly the 3 stupid girls at the front desk). The food takes way to long. It's often crowded and full of jackass people. You feel like you're eating in Europe...that might be fine for pretentious morons, but I can't stand Europeans, all I wanted to do was enjoy a fresh breakfast, but noooooooo, not here.  I've eaten here several times...there is one very good waiter, and things used to be different...the used to be good...since the renovation, the place has gone to shit."}
{"text":"Great place excellent breakfast and lunch.  The demand shows.. they def need a larger or an additional location!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot, EVERY TIME!!  And, the service is in point.... Morning meditation and pork belly grits, here I come!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We were on an early morning walk to get coffee at Portage Crossing. We stopped to appreciate the new store front of First Watch and they invited us in for breakfast!  We couldn't believe it! They were having a friends and family event and just invited us in!  I've noticed First Watch in other locations but never have been inside.  The food was delightful.  I had the farm stand breakfast tacos, my daughter had French toast, bacon, and a fruit cup, and my Lady had Lemon Curd Ricotta Pancakes. They even had yogurt for the baby. We had coffee, water, and OJ.  It was a lovely breakfast and the service was friendly and attentive. They have high chairs and slings available for the little bitty  ones. Sarah was our server and she was outstanding.  We will absolutely return soon."}
{"text":"Good food for the price.  Suggest downloading app to be on wait list cause it can get busy. Multigrain bread is fabulous."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Our waitress had zero personality and then when we waited and waited and waited... you get the idea! The food was classic first watch and was good but this location was a zero star for service."}
{"text":"First Watch in Matthews is new and we are looking forward to eating there often.  We've been twice for breakfast and the food was delicious and well priced.  Service was excellent.  Plenty of parking and the restaurant decor is relaxing and spotless.  The lunch menu also looks delicious ...looking forward to trying that soon!"}
{"text":"Love that the Yelp app lets you know how long the wait is and that you can get on the wait list without having to be there in person.    It was 9:30 am on a Sunday and we were driving around looking for a place to eat.  Initially we thought we'd try out a brunch place that doesn't have a location in Tucson for something different.  As soon as we drove up to this place though we saw a horde of people waiting outside.  Nope - not worth it.  We were hungry!  Searched on Yelp and saw this First Watch location had a 14-20 min wait so I got on the wait list online right then in the car.  When we got to the restaurant I checked in with the hostess and got a text 10 min later that our table was ready.  What a painless way to get a table for Sunday breakfast!  The place was packed, but service was quick and our orders were well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice spot to grab some hearty breakfast. The service is friendly and really attentive to your needs. T needed some gluten free options and, while not extensive, our server was able to get something for her that looked pretty tasty. I had \"The Works\" omelette, with the potatoes added. Quite good and I'd definitely have it again. Coffee seemed better than. average for a chain establishment. The decor is really nice and even when crowded the noise level is not overwhelming. All in all, a good place to grab a nice weekend meal, catch up with friends and enjoy the morning."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, this place disappointed me because it claimed to be healthy yet gourmet but really was just boring. The avocado toast is on sliced storebought bread. The multigrain pancake was nothing to remember. The house coffee is watered down. Maybe we ordered the wrong items but it really was a forgettable experience."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stop by First Watch pretty frequently before work. I love it here! The atmosphere is incredible, I've never seen a waitress without a smile on her face, and the menu is great! I do agree with previous reviews about it being a little overpriced, but I also feel like you get a generous amount of food. I like to rotate between the Healthy Turkey & the Farmhouse Hash. I have never had a problem with either dish! Also, there's something about the coffee there that is to DIE for. It's amazing! I love stopping here because the wait is short, the staff is well trained, and the food comes out quick & hot!"}
{"text":"Checkout yesterday was incredibly slow. What happened to the nice gentleman that usually staffed the desk??"}
{"text":"Wonderful and really fresh food. They have a great take on breakfast with really delightful flavors. Definitely give them a chance and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The line was too long at another breakfast eatery so we decided to try this place.  The decor was nice and no wait.  The server I had was lackluster and on automatic.  My husband ordered a pot of decaf coffee and it was lukewarm amd lacking in flavor.  He judges a place by their coffee so this was a strike against them. My food, the Bacado, was nice eith lots of bacon.   I liked the option of having some greens instead of potatos.  My husbands biscuits and gravy was cold like his coffee.  Strike 2.  Lukewarm service and food means we will not return."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and my experience was good. The restaurant looks great - clean lines and really well-decorated interior. Coffee was good and there was some interesting variety on the breakfast menu. My frittata was fine but somewhat bland. As a toast aficionado, though, I can say their toast options are all delicious. I will definitely go back and try more of the breakfast options."}
{"text":"Elevated Egg Sandwich is a must!  4 stars because service was inconsistent, but we were well taken care of overall.  We'd return when visiting next year!"}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos rock! Served with seasoned black beans, they are the perfect cure for a Mexican breakfast craving. Plus, if you ask, you get a complimentary iced tea to go (if you ordered tea with your meal). Service is always spot on."}
{"text":"I've never experienced this before and maybe it was a miscommunication but my baby and I went there for breakfast and sat for 20 minutes. We waited and waited and waited and waited and never got served. Other people got served but we didn't. We weren't waiting for anyone and left. Still shaking my head. Wow."}
{"text":"The new wake up call juice was amazing! The flavor in everything was amazing too. Very delicious food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Love love this place!! Their food and drinks were not only delicious but also healthy and wholesome.  They have a great selection on the menu And they all sound delish! We love coming here !"}
{"text":"Great food that is not of your regular breakfast selections!  I tried the Bacon & Onion hash.  Awesome!  Not the usual bacon and eggs.  Coffee is very good as well.  Place was packed, although we were seated very quickly.  My associate had the Chickenchanga... Looked awesome, he was pleased.  A return visit is definitely in order.  Serving staff were quick and courteous."}
{"text":"Why go here?: So you wake up one morning and you think to yourself, hey I'm hungry and in an area with a huge variety of unique, one-of-a-kind places to eat, why not go and try a place with a sunshine in the logo, right? And that's where I've gotta stop you, my friend. I too was lured to First Watch with the thought that if they only do breakfast, they must know a thing or two about waking up and feeling good, perhaps with a special variety of coffees and smoothies. But I was sorely disappointed. The moment I walked into the dining room I immediately noted the lack-luster, mess-hall feel of the place, with a noisy open kitchen, and a sprawling impersonal dining room. Then, there was the let down of no special breakfast beverages. All this I could have let slide with good food or a hint of personality, but there was nothing. The food was alright (although grossly overpriced), and the service was fine, but I couldn't help thinking, why? Why wake up and choose to come here? Something about the whole experience leaves a taste in my mouth like a happy meal toy; plastic, overpriced, no-sharp-edges type-place, almost as though the owners wanted to be sure you realize that \"this isn't one of those dirty, greasy-spoons; it's a chain\". Perhaps that appeals to some people, but certainly not to me. Why, why in a city with so many great, breakfast places with warmth, character, good food and low prices, would someone choose to eat in a place that aims to be so average."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this First Watch location for over 12 years because we love the management and staff.   They give great service to everyone that comes through the door, but we feel we have a special bond with the crew, which makes us keep coming back.    The First Watch food is exceptional, but we come for the welcoming environment.  They know my order (everyone on the team), have my drink without asking and spend a few minutes to see how we are doing.    Great place to be a regular"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for breakfast! Great quality, local ingredients, delicious food and diverse menu. At first I was concerned because there were few vegan options. But my waitress accommodated my dietary needs and gave me several options for modified menu items. Food was delicious and service was wonderful. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We tried this place this morning. Hubbie had a coupon and was close to home. No Bueno! We were seated quickly and the staff was friendly. Waitress was efficient and the food came quickly. The food was Meh at best. I can say I always order bacon extra crispy and they actually listened to that request not many do. I had the Ricotta pancake with lemon curd (out of a jar I'm quite sure) the strawberries marinated at least that was the description( fresh cut that's it). The pancake was heavy and dry. The hubby had the farmhouse skillet. It comes with bacon and avocado in a potato medley both were scant. The potatoes were cooked but almost warm.  The new deco was cute but lots of paint missing around the booths and the seats were filthy. The floor where I sat was very sticky. The outdoor furniture was downright tacky and old left from the last place that was there it seems.  Needs some major TLC. Will we return? No."}
{"text":"Returned for Birthday lunch.  Meal was a disaster.  Crab & asparagus omelette was ordered. Crab was brown and from a can.  Tomatoes were from a jar, asparagus was tough and a day old. cheese was tasteless and meal was sent back. Field greens had oil and no seasoning.  Gave it one star because multi grain bread and jam was good. Also turkey club with bacon and cheese on sour dough was tasteless. Sour dough was white bread. Clam chowder did not have fresh clams in it.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is usually pretty mediocre compared to other brunch/breakfast places in the Phoenix are. The only time I visit here is when it is convenient, because I'm in the area. This past visit however was actually disgusting. I ordered one of their specials, huevos rancheros tostadas, but I got it without the chorizo since I am a vegetarian. I actually felt sick after eating it. The amount of \"crema\" on it was repulsive, it's literally all I could taste even after trying to scrape most of it off. The only beans were in a slaw on the side, which was actually pretty tastey, but this means the meal was just tostadas, eggs, a small amount of smashed avocado, all drenched in the crema. Definitely not a meal that should be allowed to be called huevos rancheros. I feel like I just ate a bowl of sour cream. I ended up eating it, because I was so hungry I did not want to wait for more mediocre food. I understand this is a special, but in my opinion it should be removed from the menu immediately, it was that bad.  Also, as a side note, I wanted coffee, but they only have 2% milk. I asked if they had almond milk, and our waitress said 2% was all they had. They do not even offer skim. I find this odd for a restaurant that is supposed to have healthier options offered."}
{"text":"I was kind of reluctant to try First Watch because it was a chain.   Let me start by saying I am vegetarian and I must say they have some really nice options for us.  I have had a few different items including the avocado toast and the veggie skillet, both were very tasty.  Overall, I would say that the food is pretty good.  Service has been good at this location and I have been back several times with no issues to speak of.   Go ahead and give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. It has become our go to breakfast spot in Gilbert. Some of our favorites include the Elevated Egg Sandwich, AM Superfoods and the Market Hash. Our server, Ellen, was very nice and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"I dont make it out this way often at all....luckily I live fairly close to another watch so i can frequent more.  I can usually be found here trying to get seated before lunch time after Sunday services...most of the time I am in just under the stroke of noon!  I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and brunch!  All options are fantastic and I dont feel you can go wrong with anything the menu has to offer.  It caters to one and all from the meat lover to the meat haters and everything in between!  Almost all of the servers are super friendly and very willing to offer their opinions and takes on the dishes.  Each time we have gone the wait has been well worth it...try to stick to the menu because I found out when I change it up with add ons or trying to go outside the box it could be quite costly...oof! There are a few locations about the valley, they were once connected with another restaurant known as the good egg, but now they have seperated so if you knew them when they were connected they no longer share items of the same menu so be prepared to look for something new if the fave is now off the menu!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so critical and not picky here but I really like this spot! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day too!! I don't live in town anymore so I try to make it to First Watch at least once with my folks every time I come here to visit.   The breakfast sandwich with avocado, bacon, cheese, and egg is #brunchgoals and everything else that I've tried has been pretty good. I can't ask for more really. Even their drip coffee is pretty decent.   Can't diss it till ya try it!"}
{"text":"Very nice - the food and service was superb!  Was glad to see it open up in Tempe.  The pot roast hash is awesome.... if only it were a regular menu item.  The staff is very accommodating to our dietary requirements.  The only reason for not giving it five stars is because the parking is limited and they do not accept AARP discounts.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place when it was The Good Egg. For a Friday morning at 9, this place was a mess. Took 10 min for a server to even come by, took way to long for our orders to come out and then one of them was wrong. Time to find a new stop as we head up north."}
{"text":"I still can't get over how delicious this meal was! My mom and I had a nice brunch here. This was maybe her second time here and my first.   My mom ordered 2 For You with half a sandwich and a salad with a Morning Meditation juice, which by the way, is so tasty!   I ordered the Elevated Egg Sandwich and substituted the seasoned potatoes for fresh fruit with a Kale Tonic juice. First and foremost, I appreciate that First Watch has a variety of fruit that they give you... unlike other breakfast/brunch places that I have been to where they only have cantaloupe, melon, and pineapples. Mind you, I HATE anything melon.  I've never been a green juice kind of person, but the Kale Tonic seemed to have caught my eye, so I gave it a shot. The sandwich was too good that I really don't know how to describe how good it was lol.  My first time experience exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be coming here again and taking my fiancé!!!"}
{"text":"the service was great, but pricey and mediocre food.  I prefer village inn or dennys"}
{"text":"Contemporary, healthy looking food. Went with eggs benedict florentine, presentation exception, eggs cooked well. coffee is good, tried out the healthy meditation drink, but have mixed reservations about value at $4.00 price. The parking situation is hard to understand, but they have meters and parking deck. The location itself is part of a new complex loaded with apartments and stores."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with breakfast from First Watch.  It's one of my favorite places.  It's one of the favorite breakfast places for everyone I take to try them out.  Can't go wrong!  I frequently dine at the Arcadia location because I live so close.  Over the weekend I tried this new location in Gilbert.  We got there around 10ish on Sunday morning.  There was a 20-30 minute wait.  We put our name on the list, they took our number and said they'd text when our table is ready.  We walked over to Natural Grocers to kill some time.  After about 20 minutes we walked back to First Watch to check on our table.  It wasn't ready yet but there's a community table in the front of the restaurant that's open seating.  When asked if we'd like to sit there, we took them up on their offer.   I can't remember our server's name but she was awesome.  My boyfriend has never been to First Watch and had no idea what to order because of the various options.  This is a good thing!  I talked him into getting a waffle (mainly because I love them and wanted a bite ). Along with 2 scrambled eggs and turkey link sausages.  I ordered the skillet that featured, eggs, bacon, onions, cheddar cheese, and red peppers instead of tomatoes, with a side of fruit and toast.  Every time I visit I try something different.  Every single time and I've never been disappointed.  If I get lunch I'm for certainly getting an Iced Green Tea.  The coffee is crazy good and really fresh.  We finished our meals with a meditation tonic drink to go (I believe that's the name).  It's a beat, ginger, orange and guava drink ... I think :)"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food was amazing. We were quickly seated but took a while for the server to greet us. I had the salmon Benedict with the potatoes. The menu is very healthy so first option is salad but I passed for the carbs...it was worth it. The only thing that could make this place better is if they had mimosas."}
{"text":"I usually go to another location and order the \"Chickichanga\" basically a breakfast enchilada with chorizo and white meat chicken very filling and savory.  This time was to the location near my house where IF I could give the service 25+ stars I would in a second the hostess was warm and inviting our server was on point very warm, professional and friendly.  A+ for the seasoned potatoes, A- for the side order of breakfast turkey sausage it had a good flavor and temperature (the right amount of seasoning) my ham and Gruyere cheese omelette was okay, filled with lots and lots of ham which would be great but it seemed to be the sliced deli meat type that you buy from the deli meat section and pull back the plastic seal.  To be quite honest it was an abundant portion but quite dry.  The eggs themselves seemed a bit rubbery, I know they use top notch cage free eggs I just think the omelette sat around too long and not in front of me.  A+++++ for the service the food was just okay.  I will be back to order something else for sure."}
{"text":"I wish this location was closer to my house! My Mother and I were going to brunch and I tried to check in on the app when we left her house and it said no wait, so 10 minutes later we got right into a booth (granted it continued to fill up immediately after our arrival) our server was fantastic super friendly and helpful. He recommended the morning meditation juice so we gave it a try, Orange, lemon, ginger, agave nectar and beet and something else I forget. It was very fresh and delicious. My Mother always gets the steel cut oatmeal our server asked if she ever tried the granola with Greek yogurt she said no so he brought her a sample of it to see if she wanted it for her next visit. I got the bacado omelette, I'm usually not a fan of bacon but I wanted to try it. Bacon was crisp torn into small pieces, Monterrey jack cheese sour cream and avocado. When it arrived it had a small piece of avocado on top and I thought \"great there's my tiny avocado portion\" to my surprise it was actually filled with it so much that I couldn't eat it all. Eggs and home fries were very good I have had some issues with these two staples at other locations but not here. Really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"It's Sunday brunch day. The day the fiancé and I start off our lazy Sunday by finding a new breakfast spot to try. We didn't feel like driving far today so we searched and found First Watch. It's located in the Promenade shopping plaza so it's pretty easy to find and we arrived shortly after 10am when there was only a few minutes wait for a table. By the time we left at 11ish the waiting area was much fuller than when we had arrived. Just a note if you don't feel like waiting too long.   The first perk of this place is the complimentary coffee in the waiting area. A nice touch while you're waiting and saves you from having to pick up star bucks on the way or ordering coffee at your table.   The second perk is the variety of menu choices and the fresh taste of the food. We each ordered an egg plate and added one pancake to share so we'd have something sweet with our breakfasts. The eggs and even the potatoes taste light and fresh. Not overly greasy. Portion sizes are appropriate so that you feel satisfied but not ridiculously stuffed. The banana crunch pancake was good but we didn't think it was worth the $4 for one pancake.   Overall, a decent place with good food and good service."}
{"text":"I am so happy I didn't go to Bob Evans. This was just real good food in a nice setting"}
{"text":"I'd give five stars if First Watch would have a gluten free option for bread. Gluten free for Pancakes and Crepes would be nice too! Gluten free can actually taste better than wheat when done right. (Elevate Coffee down the street offers great gluten free crepes.) How I'd LOVE to order the Smoked Salmon & Cucumber toast! Instead, I had the Smoked Salmon Frittata. PLEASE GIVE US A GLUTEN FREE BREAD OPTION!!!   And JOHNNY is a great waiter! He knows the menu choices so well! JOHNNY GETS FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"The server PJ is excellent you need to request her.  Great food and service.  Plates are weird."}
{"text":"Great place!! Thank you fellow YELPERS  for the recommendation.   Server brings a glass  milk bottle of water to the table.   Flavored creams are a  nice touch.  Great benedicts!!  I had the Florentine, and my husband had the  salmon benedict.   Rustic , yet modern setting..   Really good."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch chain in Ohio. I love their seasonal menus that change and the fact that they have fresh juices/ healthy choices. This location is great, busy all of the time, but it's big enough that you aren't made to wait for too long like the macedonia location. Only issue I've had here has been with winter this year the restaurant always feels too cold. I'm always finding myself ordering coffee in order to get warm. I love their Morning meditation/Day Glow juices. I love many food options: avocado toast, garden omelet, the potato skillet dishes..the list goes on!"}
{"text":"I live fairly close so i can frequent often...I can usually be found here trying to get seated before lunch time after Sunday services...most of the time I am in just under the stroke of noon!

{"text":"This place was something I was pretty excited about trying given their seemingly healthy menu. However, three tables were served before us, our waitress was never anywhere to be found, and we stuck at a table next to a woman who was smacking her lips while on her phone the entire time.   Food was good though."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite brunch spots.  Everything, freakin' everything is soooooo good.  The hash dishes, the omelets and the pancakes.  They have awesome brunch drinks as well.  I can't think of my favorite cocktail but it features bullet bourbon and as peach vodka.  Yes .... Bourbon and vodka!  There's usually a wait, once you dine here you'll see why.  There's such a variety of pancakes to try ... red velvet, cinna-bon flavored, smore's kind ... sooooo many!"}
{"text":"I can not believe how much this place made our vacation. Very comfortable atmosphere. The food is now a part of my dreams. Shared the pumpkin pancake and the market hash between me and my wife. Also had morning meditation drink and loved it. My wife was making me jealous as she was moaning while she was eating!"}
{"text":"Love this!! Morning meditation drink is great! The lox is good every time has been a good experience. The first time I visited was the one in VA and this is exactly the same! Great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I had been craving a stack of light fluffy pancakes for awhile. My family decided this would be the place to try but I was confounded to find that all they had was MULTI GRAIN pancakes! WTH! Any nutritionist half up to date knows NOBODY can digest that crap! I even looked at their other offerings to find that they put wheat germ on the other stuff! YUCK! Indigestible and gross!  To the few who are caught up in the 'whole grain trend' that humanity spent 6 thousand of years perfecting the arts of AVOIDING-you can have your SAWDUST pancakes! GROSS!"}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast spot. Everything I have tried has been good! Super clean inside and friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute in general. Although the actual booths and built in seating styles seemed to not match the rest of the decor. My guess is that they did not renovate the interior except for the walls when moving in. (I was told it used to be a different breakfast place)  I was coming for brunch with my family on a Sunday afternoon. I pulled up my yelp app to get directions and good thing I did because the app told me there was a 30 minute wait but I could reserve my spot online (thanks yelp!!). I checked us in and it gave me around 20 minutes to get there and check in with the hostess. After checking in person we only waited about 5 minutes.  They left a jug of water and a coffee cup at our table. Nice touch! I loved that. I got a triathlete omelet (it was called something along those lines) and it was delicious. I totally forgot to take a picture because of how hungry I was and how delicious it looked!!  At the time that I went it was definitely an older crowd. Most of the restaurant was guests of over 60 years old.  Overall it was delicious food, decent service, plenty of menu options, a bit mixed in the ambiance, but busy. I expect to be coming back one day with my mother."}
{"text":"Omg! This place was amazing!  My boyfriend suggested it and I had never heard of it before. I didn't have my phone on me either so I had no idea what I was in for.   We came for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There seemed to be a lot of people waiting but the hostess said the wait was only 15 minutes so we decided it should be worth it. The wait time was accurate and they had plenty of space to wait around at outside and inside. Inside there was complimentary coffee and water along with newspapers and menus which made the 15 minutes feel like 5. The couches were super comfy too so that probably helped!  The place itself was darling. It had a very charming ambiance that was fluid throughout. I got a superfood a.m. bowl that consisted of a chia seed pudding topped with tons of fruits and a side of peanut butter toast. I've never had chia seed pudding and was worried I wouldn't like, but it was AHHmazing.   I will *totally* be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"Is this a heath food place?  Menu is incredibly confused and pretentious.  Breakfast should be simple and not overly complicated.  Not everyone likes avocado or whole grain artisan toast.  We literally looked at everything on the menu and nothing sounded good.  Waitress took way to long to return and take our order.  So we did what I haven't done in years, and walked out not eating anything.  Based on the reviews I've read on here, looks like we made the right choice."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed in this new location. I have a strict diet and for being so healthy they are not accommodating. I can't have onions, asked if in potatoes they said no, wrong. Asked for another option than bread bc no gluten, she agreed to fruit but brought bread. When I said I can't eat this (we had a full conversation when I ordered) she didn't take it back or bring fruit. Not to mention waited forever to get helped, no refills. I used to go to other location but think this experience has me over it!"}
{"text":"Really loved the food. Atmosphere, and service.  This is a great place for conscious eating-- great local food that you can tell is made with a real attention to its purpose.  I had a classic breakfast, which is anything but ordinary.  The potatoes are outstanding!!  Best bread toast ever, and a homemade jam.  If how you can at and what you eat matters, this is the perfect place. This was a truly enjoyable breakfast and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The gluten sensitive options are kind of limited but what I had was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here and we absolutely love it!!!!! Everything on the menu looked so good it took up 30mins to figure out what to get. I want to go back every day till we try everything on the menu!!! I got the morning power bowl and IT. WAS. AMAZING!!!!!! I could actually eat that every day too. It you like healthy brunch food, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Avacado Toast is marvelous . It comes with 2 eggs anyway you want. I so enjoyed my breakfast with coffee. The service is excellent.  This could turn into our Sunday breakfast place."}
{"text":"Recently, my friend & I come to eat breakfast here at least once a week. We absolutely love it here because of the insanely great service and the insanely great food served.   The service is always so friendly and welcoming. Mind you, that this location does get busy, when you walk in you are greeted and welcomed like family. Each server I have ever gotten has been so helpful and impressive. They are great at friendly conversation while handling multiple tables at a time. Not once, has my beverage ever been empty.  The food that comes out of their kitchen never fails to satisfy anyone. If you need a home cooked meal, then come here because that's exactly what they'll give you. Aside from the food being tasty and savory, it will not make you feel sluggish and slow. Unlike most places, First Watch actually cares about what they serve you, only giving out fresh, organic foods. Once you finish, the food actually energizes you and does not weigh you down. It's amazing!   I love everyone at First Watch and if I could I would give y'all 6 stars. Keep up the great work, and thanks for making the environment so enjoyable :]"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious cafe/diner type of breakfast/lunch place with good prices, then go to First Watch in midtown Phoenix.  The food and coffee and is fantastic, I've never had a bad meal their. Probably one of my favorite places to go for Eggs Benedict. Every server I've ever had there has been on point, and smiling. I thought it was surprisingly cheap for how good the food was. Lots of variety and choices on the menu.   Easy access and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"\"Definitely an acquired taste to eat here\". Says the server himself, and I agree! I ordered the biscuits and gravy and even though I do not care for hot sauce; I had to dowse the entire plate with it due to its lack of flavor. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, sorry."}
{"text":"Looked at the menu and was impressed however the food was served  only slightly warm. When we asked for the pancake to be heated, came back hard and  crunchy on one side. Yuck! The waiter was apathetic at best. This was a gift card, so not much out of pocket which was a good thing!  Pretty sure we won't try again!"}
{"text":"I'm a snowbird and truly disappointed to see that my favorite egg place the good egg.was taken over by first watch.  The food was average at best and the staff plain with the manager hovering over everyone to make sure they were positive and up beat.  It went from packed and fun to slow and old."}
{"text":"Ohhh what not to say about a First Watch!! Love, love it. We always go out of our way to find a First Watch when traveling. Their breakfasts are fresh and fast. Try the avocado toast. Wonderful!! Great go to place."}
{"text":"Very well done. This location is way better than the Rocky River location.  Cute interior, fantastic menu with lots of healthier options, and hello, BRIOCHE bread. My fave.  Repeat after me:  BREE-yo-shuh.  The Croque Madame is great, but it arrived a tad on the colder side (thus the 4-star review). Warm that baby up a few extra degrees and I'm in.  I usually order the Elevated Egg Sandwich---it is my favorite.  Attentive service."}
{"text":"Crowded on wknds. Be prepared to stand in line for bkfst.  Otherwise food was good - nothing exceptional.  Service variable.  Inexpensive."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Service, was not very good.  I saw the server pick up someones toast with his bare hands to see what was underneath it, and put it back down and served the plate to the customer, gross!"}
{"text":"The host needs to learn \"cooth\", she needs to be trained better.  The AC wasn't on, we had to ask for them to turn it on, people were fanning themselves, the server was nice, BUT we asked for water ... she brought it, but no glasses to drink out of it with lol.  Four orders, and they brought only one order out ... finally got the other orders.  Food was just ok. My bananas were brown.  No one came back to ck on us ... someone needed more water, someone needed dressing for salad.  Bad management. I won't be back and won't suggest anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Super friendly service and awesome food. The iced coffee is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. I was really impressed with this place and I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly cheerful & glad to see you. Food is fast fresh & delicious whether it's to go or you eat there. Coffee is sometimes a tad too bitter, and they don't have Dr. Pepper....What?!?. Free plentiful parking."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the power quinoa breakfast bowl. Awsome service by staff. Only wished the kept a veteran discount they had in the past."}
{"text":"Meh. Came here for breakfast today and all I can say it was substance. Nothing memorable even for breakfast food. Even though the restaurant appeared to be clean there is still room for improvement. We sat in a booth and the window ledge was thick of dust, food and dead flies plus I had to get fresh silverware due to dry caked on food. Yuk!  Our food came and my husband ordered the smoked brisket hash. The hash was served  in a skillet and it was watery. I had the waffle and it was pretty basic. I've had better. I also ordered sausage links and when our server put the plate on the table both links rolled off the plate and across the table and almost onto to the floor until I stopped them. His comment was \" wow they can roll\". Really? No apology or replacement? After seeing the window ledge and the silverware I wasn't too sure about the table so I chose not to even try it. Sorry but I won't go back."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Sunday around noon. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant has updated, modern decor. The restaurant had the A/C on since it was to be 90 degrees today but I was super cold as we were seated directly under a vent. The server was polite and quickly placed our order for the lemon blueberry quinoa pancakes with a side of turkey sausage and Chickichanga. Our food arrived and while the pancakes were tasty, there wasnt much lemon taste in the cream topping. I had grains of quinoa in each bite and the blueberries were certainly present. The turkey sausage casings were peeling and they were all undercooked with a bit of pink inside. The chickichanga had a delicious sauce but little flavor of the chorizo. The chicken was juicy and the potatoes had good seasoning. After sharing with the server that the sausage was undercooked, she removed them from the bill since I was almost finished with the rest of my meal. The staff were polite but not overly friendly. I was pleased to use a birthday coupon from their e-club but not sure this place stacks up compared to other local breakfast options."}
{"text":"Sorry I have to massively disagree with the positive reviews. The food is just lousy. I would rather eat at home and I am really great cook.  Every location, all 4 times I tried it. Dry breakfast potatoes and I was not impressed with anything I ordered. There is NO need to rise early to beat the crowd...  Save your dollars from this over hyped, Yuppified( I AM a DIWK type yuppie) gathering place and head over to Bob Evans, George's in Cleveland, Joe's in Rocky River, The re opened Big Egg in the Detroit Shoreway, The Cafe at the WSM, The Coffee Pot in Lakewood, Two Dad's Diner, Lucky's Cafe in Tremont,  The Original Pancake House,Cracker Barrel or Waffle House ANYWHERE!  honestly, I have NO idea how this place survives..."}
{"text":"For the longest time I stopped going here because I felt like a lot of things went down hill- the service, the food quality, etc but I recently came back to try after a couple month hiatus. I was pleasantly surprised. They seemed to have fixed a lot of their issues and the food and service have been consistently meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks. For starters the carrot chai drink is delicious and perfect in the morning. I got the pumpkin pancake breakfast. So delicious. Never have I gotten a pancake so fluffy. And to finish it off I got the millionaires Bacon. Holy crap it was so good. I was surprised at how fast we got our food Cuz it looked really busy. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Just realized I've never given a review for this place. But I've gone here plenty of times. We generally would make a visit here on Saturday or Sunday. 5 or 6 of us. Every one liked First Watch. when trying to decide we're to go for a mid or late morning breakfast. First Watch usually won out. They have  varied menu. With lots to choose from.including lots of healthy choices too. The coffee. Hmm I wasn't always loving their coffee.  Never had a bad visit. Wait staff always friendly from hostess to manager. Really a pleasant experience.  Busy every day but weekends are busiest. Parking is easy they have own private car park.  Easy to get to. Even if you don't have a car. Take the Light Rail to Thomas and Central. Walk West on Thomas Rd. Which is the avenues First Watch is on the south  side of the street. Perhaps a 5 minute walk from Central Ave."}
{"text":"Great service! Went to breakfast with family. The food and staff were friendly and our food amazing. I had the chicken salad melt. You MUST try it!!! Loved the fact that the tables were NOT packed in and noisy like most breakfast places. Nice and pleasant change."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes, as I've been going to the First Watch in Phoenix for years and love their food and service.... but this location was a huge disappointment. I will attribute most of my negative experience to the terrible service by our waitress Rachel, however, I wasn't impressed with the food either. I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs. The \"scrambled\" eggs were runny and still had the yolk. I would have sent them back, but our waitress disappeared for 30+ minutes and never came back to check on us after the food was brought out. I eventually went to the front desk to ask for our check. A different waitress (Jessica - she was great!!) quickly delivered our check and apologized for the poor service. With all that said, I think I'd rather drive an extra 15 miles to the Phoenix location for better service."}
{"text":"Great Consistent Quality Breakfast... No matter the day and time it's worth the time. Great service and very clean.. Got to love a Fresh Squeezed orange juice.."}
{"text":"Okay, okay. The is by far our favorite breakfast place now! Easy parking, no wait time for a table, attentive and quick service, AND the food is amazing! We had the millionaire bacon, shrimp and grits, and the avocado toast (OJ and the Glo juice). Everything is amazing. Just buy it all and leave super happy!"}
{"text":"Came in with my mother and sister for a quick brunch. We received a table right away and our waiter was nice and very attentive. Every time we visit First Watch, we know what we're getting. The quality of food and service is consistent. You can never go wrong coming here. They update their tasty season specials regularly including drinks. It's a pleasure coming here."}
{"text":"I would eat here for breakfast every day if I could afford it. Fresh ingredients, creative recipes, and great service. We have been waiting 20 years for a breakfast place like this in South Chandler. So happy that First Watch is here."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for breakfast last week. We got there around 9 am and was seated right away. The place is not huge, but they make the most of the space as far as seating goes. They have a nice variety of breakfast and lunch options. They also have a nice variety of coffee, tea, and juices. My mom and I decided on the same thing. We got the eggs Benedict Florentine- which is cibotta bread, poached eggs, spinach, tomatoes, and hollandaise sauce. They offered eggs Benedict three different ways which I thought was cool. Our meal came with either dressed greens or breakfast potatoes. We both went with the potatoes. Our meal came out quickly and the portions were a good size. The table beside us got pancakes, and they were as big as the plate! I'll definitely be back to try some other menu options! This is a great little cozy breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a long layover in Phoenix, this place was great! Eggs Benedict was delicious and everything else was too. The service was also great, would definitely come here again if I'm lucky enough to be in the area!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC menu. Everything was fresh and well-made. Perfect portions and reasonable pricing. Went to the new Market District location."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great fun! They told us it would be a 25-30 min wait and we seated in less time. Had the salmon frittata, power wrap, and açaí squeeze. All very delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been several times, good food, but pretty much bad service. It's very hit and miss. They need to hire people that aren't just teenagers."}
{"text":"Service was slow, we had to ask multiple times for water.  Food was decent but not overly impressive.  There was a nice variety of healthy veggie options."}
{"text":"We have been to 3 different locations, all of the experiences sucked. At the 83rd street location, It took over 30 minutes to get a table (and there were plenty if open tables), food took over and hour and 20 minutes to get, and then when we got it, the food was cold and we had to send it back. Major issues here, and avoid this place if you don't have 2 hours to kill. It took 40 minutes to just get water as our drinks. Ugh, this place has gone to crap!! We arrived at 11:35 and we are just leaving now at 1:37, and we ate in less than 15 min. Not a manager in sight to complain to. Multiple tables threatening to get up and leave. Our family has been going to the good egg for over 15 years and sad to say we won't be going back! And customer service, don't bother replying cause obviously management doesn't give two rats butts about speed and service after the multiple complaints on this site!"}
{"text":"Wow the breakfast of pork belly and grits. OMG  Pulled the description from their website:  Bob's Red Mill® Cheddar Parmesan cheese grits topped with thick-cut braised pork belly bacon, two poached cage-free eggs, pickled peppers and fresh herbs. Served with lemon dressed organic mixed greens and artisan ciabatta toast. The pork belly is melt in your mouth awesomeness. The grits had a light cheese taste. The poached eggs were done perfectly. Coupled with the red peppers, the spoon full was a breakfast symphony in your mouth. The greens and toast were very fresh! This is a seasonal dish but I hope it stays forever! This is my first time here and will be back!"}
{"text":"I will not be coming back here. I came in with my son and prob stood there waiting for a table while the cashier completely ignored me. Even after seeing me she went and out her reciepts away while not saying anything to me. When I asked for a menu she seemed annoyed and kind of just pointed rather than getting it for me. As we sat down she didn't smile or anything. Then when we ordered we thought we had a nice server but instead he was so eager to help the table behind us who came in after rather than ask us if we needed anything . My son is almost 3 and when I asked for more napkins he gave me 2. Ok that's really going to help with a messy toddler. Finally at the end my son got up and went to the backyard door. A server came by and was rude to my son and kept asking where I was. I was sitting right there and trying to get my stuff and our leftovers cleaned up.  I will definitely not go there and will tell my mom friends how they ignored me and my son. And if they had been  nice and helpful they would have gotten a great tip as I usually over tip VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy breakfast and lunch options. I left feeling full but not gross full. If you're looking for your typical breakfast hole in the wall diner  you might not like this place. A little more expensive and there's a good chance your eggs will come with a side of greens. If you enjoy eating healthy you'll love the menu. Very clean, good seating, and great service."}
{"text":"I wanted everything on the menu but settled for the lemon ricotta pancakes. What a treat! Service was fantastic the coffee was good I would totally come here time after time!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a First Watch and I hope it won't be the last. I was in the Akron Area after working overnight in a filthy warehouse. I was very aware that my clothes were pretty dirty and I wasn't exactly morning fresh either but I was hungry so I asked my phone where I could breakfast nearby. Dismissing fast foods, I settled on a place I had never been: First Watch. I drove over and parked. Through the window, I could see many well dressed business types and other neatly attired and clean people in a bright, clean, restaurant so I was even more aware of my appearance. I have to say it served as a good test for customer service, I probably looked one step above a murderous hobo but the hostess smiled and seated me immediately. The server showed up right away also and coffee came quickly after that. I had already seen the special \"Chilaquiles\" and decided to get it.  I'm kind of fussy about those sort of classic breakfast dishes you find in better breakfast places. Things like eggs benedict, huevos rancheros, chilaquiles, quiche lorraine - if you call something by it's classic name, in my book, you better make with the classic presentation, don't do weird stuff unless you are very clear about it in the menu.  Morning Watch did a really good job with the Chilaquiles. The chips were tasty, the eggs were perfect - there was sliced chicken breast which is a little departure from the classic but it was good. The use of Feta Cheese was also a departure, but all of these items were specified in the menu, so there's no complaint there. Everything came together very, very well over this green salsa that was good enough that I asked the server if they made it in the restaurant (they don't; she said I could actually buy it at GFS...and I might).   The side of beans was good also. Beans are the kind of food that you either say \"GROSS!\" or \"Hey, not bad\". I've never jumped out of my chair proclaiming the wonder of some beans. The crema in the beans was a nice touch and what I can say about these beans is that they didn't have that sort of mealy texture or really dirtish taste you get from old or leftover beans. They were, I suppose, humble (as beans are, I would say) but virtuous. Two steps above \"Hey! Not bad!\" but no one reading this review is going to race to their local First Watch for the beans.  Long story short: I really enjoyed my breakfast, I felt like I got better service than I expected, the price for my chilaquiles and coffee came to $13 including tip and I would definitely recommend First Watch."}
{"text":"Have eaten breakfast there several times since it became First Watch.  Each time is a little more disappointing.  Today was last time.   Had Tifecta breakfast with eggs, pancake and one sausage.  Portions are small for what you get vs what you pay.  Substantially worse than other nearby restaurants.  Service is average at best.  Good example of large national chain restaurant, very average.  Took what was a great place and made it average.   Can't substitute for much or significant up charges.  I suggest local, Two Brothers or Heart and Soul Cafe.  If you want a chain go to Denny's or IHOP, about the same."}
{"text":"Ok, this was my second visit. I wanted to give it a couple visits before a review. A 3 Star rating to me is \"good\". This is certainly, good. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Classic. The Hollandaise was a little heavy on the lemon, but overall the dish was pleasing. The fact that they use the ciabatta instead of an English muffin... creative and tasty. The greens on the side with a vinaigrette was nice and light and again...good. No Rye Toast available, which isn't a deal breaker... nonetheless a small bummer. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place hand down! Make sure to beat the church crowd and you are good to go. It can get a little crowded. My favorite is the Eggs Benedict and it hasn't failed me yet."}
{"text":"First Watch is my go to breakfast and lunch spot. I would recommend the Millionaires bacon, waffles, Baja turkey burger and avocado toast."}
{"text":"First time for me for lunch.  Loved the Monterey Turkey sandwich on sourdough!!  So fresh and loaded with goodies!   Love the decor too.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here a handful of times, always refreshing and consistent with expectations. They have a variety of items that can suit any diet. And, when you're all done eating you won't feel \"stuffed\" like other breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Great healthy food and even better service. I was in town for the weekend and LOVED this place. I liked it so much that I ordered a sandwich and salad to go for my lunch.   The pic is my breakfast of protein packed mini pancakes with almond butter. Yum yum yummmm"}
{"text":"Extensive menu for a breakfast & lunch place!  So many healthy choices :). Service was fast and friendly.  I ride my bike often and really appreciate that they have a bike rack in the shade.  There is also a patio that is on the East side of the building so it's not so hot."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Staff very friendly About bad reviews (as a business owner myself) there are just some people you cant make happy, even if its free   Try this place, I did and we loved it!  Spencer"}
{"text":"Healthy food. Relative small portion to gasoline alley. One of places offer fresh juice. Seasonal food always good. This is place we visit most than rest of breakfast places"}
{"text":"Had a bad breakfast they put green scallions on my eggs and could not eat them or scrape them off"}
{"text":"Come here probably close to once a week. Their food is consistently good and the staff is friendly. Try the avocado toast :)"}
{"text":"Adorable decor & feel...and they leave a coffee canister AT the table!   Their Pumpkin Spice (seasonal) pancakes were totally amazing! As well as the chicken apple sausage.  We ordered a side of potatoes and they were seasoned and delicious! We didn't have a wait at 9:30am on a weekday."}
{"text":"I love eating here, artisan bread is fresh & delicious  Go to place for a great way to start the day"}
{"text":"Was really surprised how good the food was, I had heard it was a little expensive, but not by much and it was worth it. Would definitely go again. I got a veggie sandwich and the bread and ingredients were sooo good. Loved the fact that everything is natural plus no microwaves and deep fryers."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place. Enjoy the avocado toast. Wow!  And the Floridian French Toast (though our version had unripe kiwis it was still really tasty).  Nice, thorough and efficient wait staff.  A new entry in our top breakfast haunts."}
{"text":"Ooh how we LOVE First Watch each and every location. We yearned for this place to be more accessible as we've been to First Watch several times in Atlanta, GA - Arizona - Katy, TX, Orlando, FL and more. We just LOVE the atmosphere, food and service and haven't been disappointed in any of the many locations.  This past Saturday we got to check out our now local First Watch which is exciting. The experience was as expected which was superb.  We approached and immediate noticed all the people waiting around outside, I was almost discouraged because we were so hungry and knew it would be a wait. The earth and stars lined up and said STAY but unveiling a parking space at the door. We pulled in and my husband went toward the door and was greeted by a young lady outside with an iPad in which he put our name on the list for a 20 min wait. The ground out front was full of colors and writing and there was a gray pail with plenty of sidewalk chalk. Our toddler was excited (this is a plus above all other location we've visited as you have to keep your children entertained on your own while waiting) and got his art on while we waited.  Upon being notified via Yelp that our table was ready (They Have the NoWait App, so get on the list in advance. We found that out once we arrived) we entered and the floor plan is nice and open and clean. We were seated and immediately greeted by our server Tequila (she worked previously at the Raleigh location). We ordered and our food did take a little while but we were busy planning out our next stops after leaving there so it was okay. Our food came out perfect and just like we ordered, hot, fresh and tasty. We devoured our food and as we completed a item someone was there to clean it up. We look forward to returning in the near future."}
{"text":"So excited to have a First Watch nearby!  I used to go to breakfast at First Watch all the time when I lived in Orlando.  Their menu is completely different from my last First Watch visit, though -- for the better!      We arrived a little after 9 a.m. this past Sunday and there was already a line.  I checked in with the hostess and learned that we could have joined the waitlist on the First Watch app.  Good to know!  Next time, we'll definitely do that.  The 45 minute wait ended up being only 30 minutes, so that wasn't too bad.  And they offered complimentary coffee while we waited.    Let me just note that a LOT of their breakfast items have mushrooms in them.  I, myself, am not a fan of eating fungus, so I usually ask them to leave them out and/or substitute something else, like greenery (e.g., spinach, kale).  I ordered the Inspired Italian omelette this time around (and, even though it didn't start with mushrooms, I added spinach anyway).  It was delicious, but I think I liked even better the Skillet Hash I had previously.  I look forward to trying one of their Eggs Benedict options next time, or perhaps going back to one of the Skillet Hashes.  The toast that comes with many of the breakfast entrees is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  It's so flavorful.  It's a whole grain artisan bread, and I even saw a woman walking out with a loaf!    The decor inside is awesome.  It has a fresh, modern farm vibe.  The layout, though, in this particular location leaves something to be desired.  They have a small waiting area when you walk inside the door, near the check-in stand.  Then you can walk a little further around the corner and there's a large waiting area where the cashier stand is (and exit door).  It seemed to us that First Watch could somehow condense these two areas and provide more seating to accommodate the crowds.  Plus, someone was always running over from the host stand area to the cashier area.  Maybe combine these two as well?  It all felt a bit odd and offered nothing but too much wasted space.    First Watch is an awesome addition to the Matthews area, which already has two of my favorite breakfast places -- Metro Diner and Stacks Kitchen."}
{"text":"service is poor, but breakfast is usually pretty tasty. Today I got a salad though, and all of the tomatoes were rotten... so gross. Left a bad taste in my mouth, no apologies or any discount on bill- after waiting 20 minutes for my replacement on a friday afternoon at 11 am. just disgusting"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to First Watch.  We were promptly seated and our orders were taken quickly after.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was cheerfully decorated and had a \"fresh\" feel about it, as did the menu.  They seemed to have an emphasis on the healthier side of breakfast which appealed to me.    Overall, I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito. My only gripe was that the home fries were slightly dry, but everything else definitely made up for that.  I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I've dined 4 times at different First Watch locations.  The menu items I had were tasty, although some are in my opinion overpriced.  Additionally, one time my food was cold - cold cooked eggs are not very appealing to me. The last time I was there with my partner who specifically said he was there for breakfast (not lunch), even though it was around 11:30am and he ordered the salmon Benedict egg \"breakfast\" which turned out to be 2 poached eggs on a half slice of some kind of roll (which was fine), and a very basic/plain small side \"salad\" of mixed greens.  We expected hash browns and/or fruit.  He left the greens on his plate.  I ordered 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 \"chopped\" salad.  The sandwich was on white (maybe sourdough?) bread which I never eat, but I suppose that was my own fault since I assumed it would be the nice multigrain bread they serve with breakfast/eggs, although they could have given me a choice.  The salad was not \"chopped\" at all and had unexpected tortilla chip strips...'not great. Since we'd already had enough coffee earlier we only had water plus one orange juice - with a tip we spent abut $30 - yikes!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I'm actually pretty patient and understanding - they seemed busy so we were sitting outside where there was one table finishing and another table that was sat down at the same time as yes apparently their server was attentive whereas ours was nowhere in sight. We were already to order and we still hadn't been brought any water or even asked if we want d anything to drink. I'm very pregnant and I have a toddler with me and I figure water is pretty easy - especially since at this restaurant they give you a carafe at your table. That's all I needed - water and to take my order. I went inside told the hostess we still hadn't had any water she said ok I'll take care of that for you. Still nothing as the table next to us continued to have their server attend to their orders. I go inside again and the hostess is like has he come out there - obviously not, and water is a pretty basic service. And she rolls her eyes at me. Look - I get it, you're busy and maybe you're having an off day - I could deal with slow service but this was ridiculous. Don't sit your customers if you can't provide them all with equal service. Btw - second time I've been here, first time service was fine but food wasn't anything special. This time I know better than to give them my business. I warn you now - it's not worth it because you'll start your day off with either mediocre food or poor service."}
{"text":"I am going to say.....we are eating here again soon. The staff and service was spot on!   The menu is diverse and fresh. We both had the cucumber mint refresher. A must! Coffee was great!   The food was amazing. My husband had the Smoke Salmon Benedict with potatoes. He practically licked the plate clean.   I had the Avocado Toast with Basted eggs. I feel the protein boost already! I had to have the one of their lemon ricotta pancakes and it was because g and filling. So worth it! Look for a FirstWatch near you!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Service was subpar. Asked for water; got it after 15 minutes, food not as described on menu, distracted waitress, has to wait for check as well."}
{"text":"Food was incredible.  Sounds weird,  but this place has the best toast. We actually tried to find the bakery online to buy some. The place was clean and well run.  Smooth service.  Nice space.  We had breakfast and it was simply some of the best breakfast food we have had."}
{"text":"Third time we've been here... Every time I've tried something new and it has been delicious! Today I had the pesto chicken quinoa bowl and it may be one of the best healthy breakfasts ever!!! Had the Elevated Egg Sandwich before and it's really tasty too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, didn't give it 5 stars because they don't have espresso coffee machines, which is strange for an upscale breakfast and lunch place."}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip pancakes ever! They also have a delicious iced coffee! Their staff is always friendly (: Went in this morning and requested to sit in the back to get some last minute studying as I ate and they were so accommodating, the food wait is reasonable. I eat here at least once a week, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice place conveniently located off of cedar. The food is good but could be better. Stopped in for brunch. Little pricier than most places. Lots of choices to choose from. The service was lightning quick. Definitely will recommend and come back."}
{"text":"The service  is very  very  very  slow.... it did irritate me a but once I got my food I was verry  HAPPY the food was DELICIOUS! I was impressed at the recipes I knew I wanted to try something  new and this is the place to go for a  creative  healthy  dish. I did wait atleast 30 minutes  for my food the waiters  tend to  forget orders  if you  dont remind them. Expect to wait 25-40 minutes for your  food."}
{"text":"Best food and service from my waitress Kayla place was super friendly and greeted by (come to find out was the manager) right when I walked in. Great prices for fresh tasty food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch a couple of times over the past few years.  Each time I have been, the food is very good.  I love the multigrain toast they serve.  Today, I got to try the seasonal pumpkin pancake and it was very good.  Although I have not yet had the chance to try them, my friend tells me that the lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious.  I plan on trying these next time I return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First visit today at First Watch Macedonia.  I was impressed considering it's a chain restaurant.    The service was great.  Ordered 'The Traditional'.  The food was really good.  Four strips of bacon - cooked perfectly.  Didn't like the breakfast potatoes - too much onion.  Would prefer plain hash browns.  But there are substitutes.  Eggs were not really over easy though.  More like over medium and medium hard (each one was different).  Sourdough toast was well buttered.  Coffee pot left on table.  Overall a good breakfast.  The only downside is the price.  A bit higher than your typical breakfast restaurant.  $9.99 for breakfast.  You can get the same meal at other places for $5.99.    Would certainly recommend this location if you don't mind paying a little more."}
{"text":"Great fresh healthy food. The place is beautiful and the staff is polite. We had a couple of their juices and some frittatas and they were all really good. Definitely recommend the juices and anything in the menu it all looks great . we will make a goal to come here again."}
{"text":"Great Experience! Great Food! Great Service! The Tri-Fecta! We forgot today was a holiday so we had to wait for a table but they offered to text us when our table was ready.  So we sat and waited.  I had to decide between the lemon ricotta pancakes and the Barbacoa Benedict...the pancakes won despite the fact that I usually get a Benedict of some kind.  I will be back to try the Barbacoa.  We sat out side despite the warmth of the morning.  It was more relaxed out there.  We sipped our Morning Meditations and the food came out within a reasonable amount of time despite the business.  It was great time.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Depressing. We came here all the time while visiting family and LOVED IT. Now that it has changed to the new menu and name, it just isn't the same. My in laws used to come here several times a week and have decided they need a new place as well.   They have removed all of our favorites from the menu and replaced them with healthier options which would be awesome, but they fail at making them work. Raw pancakes, under cooked bacon, brown avocado...  Disappointed"}
{"text":"A client recently bought me a gift card to this neighborhood cafe and what a treat! My husband had the pumpkin pancakes and I had the smoked salmon frittata, both were great (especially loved the warm syrup bottle).  The Carrot, Ginger, Chai juice was Fall fantastic with a little cinnamon stick for flair!  Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this establishment for over two years and I have a great experience every single time.   The service is almost always amazing. All servers are super attentive and hospitable. And I love that they always have a kettle of coffee when they first come to your table because I am a girl that needs her coffee.   The menu is expansive and has something that everyone would love to eat. When I feel like eating right, I get either the Healthy Turkey omelet or the Tri-Athlete omelet. Both are cooked with egg whites and filled with delicious, high quality meats, cheeses, and veggies. They are super filling without the guilt. When I feel like not counting calories, I get the chocolate chip pancakes. These pancakes are massive. We're talking almost a full 12 inches in diameter!  And you get two of them (I don't think I'm brave enough to get 3). They are so fluffy and delicious and worth every single calorie I'm sure they're loaded with.   If you haven't tried First Watch, I suggest you try it. Though it is very busy on the weekends, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here.. really cool different concept. Amazing food and service. Courtney was awesome! Thx"}
{"text":"Food Is good if you ever get service, management should all be fired,  rude waitress she says several called in today, waited 25 min to sit because, No one waits on people, another 20 min to get coffee and water. There is a reason people call in at the same time, this starts at the top. Besides where is a manager, need to make themselves present they should be working, waiting on tables, bussing doing something. Must be one of the ones that called in. It was not much better 2 weeks ago when we came. Don't think we will pick this place again for our Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to breakfast places but unfortunately things have changed over the last 9 months. Not sure what has happened but food quality and taste has gone down hill since opening. The last two times we have been there it took them 3 times to get my order correct for eggs (yes, eggs!). Both times by the time I got my eggs, everyone else was done eating and i had already eaten the rest of my food. This most recent time, i ordered the avocado toast and they actually served it to me with brown avocado. We decided we won't be back - as there are too many other wonderful breakfast places around."}
{"text":"First time visiting the one on Central Avenue. The Croque Madame was utterly out of this world. Such a large portion with a savory blend of meat, cheese, eggs and sauce.  The person with me had the Shrimp and Grits.  He was not disappointed.  Service was quick and the server was on the mark. Definitely,  one of my new favorite breakfast places."}
{"text":"This is the second time at this location.  The first was, well, the first strike.  This second trip is heading down the path to being a second strike too.  The saving grace to my last trip was the wait-staff.    First trip:  1.  Water bottle at the table had food debris floating in it. 2.  The glass was visibly dirty 3.  The breakfast tacos were WAY over cooked to the point the corn tortillas were crispy (not fried, just dry) and the egg and meat was crusted and dry. 4. The tacos were sent back and French toast was brought as a replacement...absolutely nothing worth writing home about, but the meal was comped on account of the crunchy breakfast tacos.  Second trip:  1. Wait staff was again stellar.   2. Water at the table again had floating food (I hope) particles. 3.  Ordered the trifecta, chose waffle and over light eggs.   Waffle was awesome!  Eggs were over medium/hard.  Overall, after two trips and having the 'dirty' water both times and the less than awesome food, and having great experiences with the staff, I rated my experiences 3 stars."}
{"text":"Met my friends here, they waited for about 10 min before me and we waited another 20-25 min. People seemed to be called and called but not us. Finally the guy asked us our name and got us a table (I think we got skipped or something, not entirely sure).   Our waitress was nice and attentive. We all ordered different dishes and were all happy. I've been to First Watch (different locations) MANY times and it's always good. This is the first time I tried the granola bowl- it has homemade granola, vanilla Greek yogurt, and fruit, and it was very good!  Overall happy with the food and service. Hopefully next time there's less of a wait or I use the app. Unfortunately I checked Yelp and it said no wait, so it was inaccurate."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as always, I have been here at least 20 times and the food is typically very good. I got avocado toast with scrambled eggs, which were cooked perfectly. The bread they use is thick and delicious, I want to buy this for my house! The avocado was fresh and seasoned with sea salt- yum! Our waitress was friendly, we have had her several times before. The only complaints I have are their coffee and restrooms.   1. Coffee is not particularly good, and often comes to the table not too hot. Also, the waitresses don't seem to replenish the coffee or milk on the side which is kind of annoying. For how good the food is, I would expect better coffee.  2. Bathrooms have been pretty nasty the last couple of times I have been in, I'm not sure what's going on with that. Toilet paper all over the floor, and cleaning supplies left out.   Overall I will come back because I love the food. Hopefully the bathrooms are cleaner and the coffee service is better."}
{"text":"Don't worry, they didn't forget the syrup this time. They just forgot the toast in my to go order...and a few times before that, the jam, which luckily I checked myself and caught before I left.... Can you guys please start checking your to go orders before bagging them, especially if you guys are slow that morning. Still come nearly every Friday and love the food, just...the little things."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here and keep coming back. I love the bottomless pot of coffee you get when you order and all of the different egg dishes."}
{"text":"Wow probably the best breakfast I've had in a long time. Had the Eggs Benedict Florentine style and fell in love! My first time here and I will definitely come back! Prices are pretty reasonable for a nicer breakfast place that serve fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss.   Sometimes good sometimes bad. Chef inconsistent.  Long wait today for food. Food cold. Nothing worse than cold waffles and pancakes.   Staff nice though not quick on refills of drinks."}
{"text":"First rate breakfast joint in Scottsdale. We have been here 50+ times and I have yet to get bad service or a bad meal. Everything on the menu is very fresh unlike most places. The yogurt is fantastic mixed with fresh fruit, pancakes are great and they are one of the few that can do oatmeal correctly.   Add to your list of places to get breakfast if you have not been here yet."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I've tried a few of their breakfast platters and they've been great every time I go. I like that I can take my food to go!"}
{"text":"I was looking for Breakfast Burrito and could not find a place around Mayfield for it. I ended up going to this place and got a chikkichanga which was delicious and a pretty close match of what I was looking for. Good Service too. I am satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food.  Creative menu.   Great vibe and decor  The one big drawback...you've GOT to make espresso and cappuccino and great coffee.   Just providing drip coffee from the lowest bidder cheapens the whole experience.    As an example, my incredible breakfast sandwich and pan-cooked potatoes were a culinary delight, but the drip coffee I washed them down with was totally from Denny's....it brought the entire experience to a crashing halt.    So, make better coffee and get an espresso machine and you'll get 4-5 stars...."}
{"text":"First time going here and WOW! Food and service was amazing! We loved everything we ordered. Fresh and very delicious. We happened to find this place close to our hotel and read the reviews which were great but being there and experiencing it for yourself is much doesn't do the pictures/reviews justice. Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Needed to add salt to everything for flavor. Service was horrible! Took 10 minutes for waitress take our drink order. Took another 10 minutes to get drinks. We had to ask the cashier for our ticket as we didn't see our server after that.  Don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is the worst service ordered over the phone they said 15 mins, I arrive there they tell me Oh they messed up on the first order but it will be out quickly 25 minutes later I ask if my food is ready needless to say its just sitting then they still forgot the drink I ordered first and last time. Made me miss my kids track race as well, can't get that back never again don't know if it was just bad service or racism, but no apology or even tried to discount anything."}
{"text":"First time at this location and wasn't disappointed!   The waitress was AMAZING! Sensitive to allergy needs and incredibly helpful. She was a doll!  The food did not disappoint. My veggie omelet was YUM! The salad and toast perfect accompaniments. Even the coffee was hot and delicious. I had to wait for a fresh pot to brew, but the wait was well worth it.  The only negative? The hostess seemed to have attitude. We asked to sit outside and from her reaction, that was clearly not where she wanted us. We blew it off but the moment was noted...and unnecessary."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it.   The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a \"Good Day Sunshine\" breakfast vibe.  We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has \"The Healthier Side\" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch.   The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal.   The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out.   Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better.   If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger."}
{"text":"This place is TOO PRICEY for the amount of food served.  I'm giving 3 starts because of the cost and server and manager's lack of manners.  Although I do realize the food is deemed healthier, it is still expensive for what you get.  My 12 year-old son ordered a glass of apple juice that cost $3.49, one pancake, and an order of potatoes, with the total cost of $12.00!  He was put off because they didn't have french fries but he managed to scarf down the pancake.  However, the potatoes he received were less appetizing to him because some of them were burned.  But they tasted good to me.  He was so unimpressed that during the meal he asked me, \"Where are we going for lunch?\"    My omelette was quite tasty though a little watery, and the bread was really good, as was the salad.  It would have been better to have cooked vegetables instead of a salad but that may be a personal preference.  But my meal was good overall and it felt like I had eaten healthy.  It was my birthday, and I let the server know because I had a coupon for the free birthday meal, but she DIDN'T WISH ME a Happy Birthday!  The service was o.k. but not great.  When we presented the coupon to the manager, my son told him it was my birthday, but he just looked at us and shook his head, with NO BIRTHDAY WISH either.  I have NEVER had anyone at any restaurant establishment ignore a person's birthday!!!  Especially since I had a BIRTHDAY COUPON!  Even my son found it odd and commented on it!  If we do return to another First Watch, it will be when we have a coupon, and I'll try another location!"}
{"text":"First Watch... it seems trendy, it's at Crocker Park, it's packed on weekends, its food is just ok.  I want to love First Watch - it seems like the ''in'' thing to do - it's not super expensively priced but it seems like it would be the selection of those with more ''discerning'' tastes. But the taste? It comes up bland a lot of times. I've been to this location and the one out by Whole Foods on the east side. That location would probably get an extra star - their food comes out piping hot and seems to haven been salted for flavor (what an idea!). This location? Not so much. My food is always lukewarm at best and nothing tastes that good. I've had their special - the Huevos Rancheros - and it's ingredients are delightful, but I could make a better dish at home.   I must mention that yesterday morning we got a free entrée for the boyfriend's birthday (just join the Sun eClub online for your very own). And the food was again - just ok. He had muesli pancakes (a new addition to the menu) and I had the Bacado Omelet with egg whites. When I went to log calories after that meal I was pleasantly surprised that nutritional info was available on First Watch's website but then I was abruptly slapped in the face by the 75, yes SEVENTY-FIVE grams of fat just in the omelet I consumed. Be careful what you order.  Some final tips -  1. If you must wait on a Saturday or Sunday morning, grab a coffee at the front  (its complimentary, a nice touch) and snag one of the cushy arm chairs (it makes the wait seem way shorter). 2. If you choose wisely (read: not the Bacado omelet), you can get a healthy breakfast, brunch, or lunch here. 3. Parking is available around the corner by The Gap & Coach or you can snag a spot in the parking garage directly to the right of the building. 4. Join the Sun eClub (a free meal awaits you)."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and we were impressed. Super friendly, comfortable breakfast spot. It was a little long to get our food but you can't rush perfection. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Joint. Ever!!! Their food has such a homemade taste to it. It's always fresh and if there is ever a problem (which there almost never is), they fix it immediately. I always have Michelle as my waitress. Her and the rest of the staff are always so nice. If you haven't tried it, you need to!"}
{"text":"Had such a great first experience here! Ordered the fresh green juice and it was AMAZING (coming from someone who has worked at a juice bar) and also the avocado toast which was delicious and had SO much avocado. Our server was Junior, he was fantastic. He gave great recommendations and was very friendly and accommodating. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off so glad we got in on a Sunday. We visited Newport News, Va twice and never got in!! So happy we saw this on Yelp. Well the waitress is very perky this morning and the coffee is very rich without a burnt roasted taste, yummy. BF ordered Chiliquiles, and me eggs Bene with ham n mater. Wellllll these are my thoughts. The classics: not so great. My Bene muffin was cold and soggy although there was plenty of ham... And hardly any Holidaise to speak of. Wa wa waaaaa. Won't order that again. Fruit was a nice touch tho. The Mexican dish : the eggs were undercooked for sunny side up and the verde sauce not enuf. He is used to having it with red sauce tho. Soooo the classics sucked. So again we eat all around the country and I give their food a 5 out of 10. If we try them again we will order one of their specialtys. Everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves. It's also very loud in here so a conversation is tough."}
{"text":"I too was skeptical bc, you know, chain, strip mall. But man! I'm so glad I came here!  Ambiance is cheerful and very clean. Service was efficient and just the right amount of friendly.  I ordered fresh oj, the elevated egg sandwich ( perfect) and an order of millionaire bacon to go (which I promptly ate most of bc it was SO good!  I don't live here but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and Instagram worthy. Love the pressed juices they have. I brought some friends from out of state to visit and they love the brunch options."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!! The food was so fresh and so delicious! Lots of healthy, unique options that are reasonably priced. And the staff was lovely...very nice and friendly. Two big thumbs up"}
{"text":"First Watch is a health food restaurant.  So if you are eating healthy looking for smaller portion sizes and organic foods this is a great restaurant for you. If you're looking for homemade fresh breads, Bakery, buttermilk pancakes and large breakfast portions this is not the restaurant for you. The staff was pretty friendly the wait was about 25 minutes. Food was good but not what I expected."}
{"text":"First Watch offers the standard American breakfasts.  It's good stuff.  What I noticed about this restaurant is the consumer service.  Albert's customer service skills are second to none.  Dude asked me what my name was, shook my hand and referred to me by my first name every time he came by to see how I was doing.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So. Good. Fresh ingredients and fast service. Butternut Squash soup has a touch of nutmeg and very smooth. Very cute decor. Would absolutely eat here again!"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here recently on a weekday. It was our first time at this location. We have eaten at the Promenade location many times and have rarely had a poor experience, other than the service can be a bit \"spotty\" when they are busy.  There were only two other parties in the restaurant when we arrived. Nonetheless, they tried to seat us all the way in the back in the corner booth near the bathrooms...  The main problem was with the temperature of the food. It was only lukewarm. The omelets were barely warm, the potatoes were barely warm and the toast was barely warm. In retrospect, we should have sent everything back, but we didn't want to \"make waves.\" So, we ate barely warm food. Also, our food was not exactly what we ordered. Not sure if this was the server's fault or the kitchen's fault. The service was o.k. Given that there were so few people in the restaurant, the service should have been more than just o.k. Our server was friendly, just not as attentive as we would have liked. The food itself was tasty, although we thought the portions (other than the toast) were somewhat on the small side. Additionally, there wasn't any salad on the plates. Also, the place was freezing cold!  We chose to try this location because it was convenient, and we have had good experiences at the Promenade location. However, I think it is safe to say we won't be coming back to this location, as the overall experience was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ate lunch on a Saturday and not a bad wait. Had soup and sandwich, both were seasoned and constructed beautifully. Breakfast menu was still in play and looked awesome. Very good value"}
{"text":"I ate here with a coworker yesterday.  I was heartbroken to find out the strawberry drink they had is not on the menu anymore.  I ordered the club minus the tomato and avocado.  The food was really good.  I got the home fries too.  Great place to eat if you are in the limbo between lunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"I love coming to First Watch, it is my favorite breakfast joint. I always get 2 eggs sunny side up, toast, hasbrowns and bacon. The bacon is to die for. The meal is consistently good and never disappoints. Download the app and never have to wait in line again as they get busy af!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, plentiful food, nice atmosphere, enjoyable ending to our trip to Phoenix. They were not cheap with their ingredients: swisshroom omelet was pretty good (probably better if I'd substituted egg whites for NO additional charge) & came with potatoes & English muffin; lunch combo with half Cobb salad (super fresh) & clam chowder soup & a glass each of their green juice & carrot juice, which were both a little sweeter than most juices but I'm sure it was to accommodate the masses."}
{"text":"We were felt welcome from the second we walked in. Our waitress was super friendly,  and the service was prompt and the food was delish. They have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location. Friendly staff, and a really bright, welcoming atmosphere. The menu options sounded fantastic. Unfortunately we had a bit of a wait (about 35-40 minutes), which is to be expected at a breakfast house on a Sunday morning. However, they weren't that busy, and there were empty tables on the patio they weren't seating.   My dad's Benedict came out cold, but he didn't say anything. I asked for a bite, and when I commented on the temperature, he said, \"I didn't want to have to wait any longer.\" Poor guy. My omelette was ok, but not great. The meat inside was a little tough.   I will probably be back again to sample some other options (the lemon ricotta pancakes sound interesting!), but today was underwhelming. This place seems to have a loyal following, so this may have just been a one-off.   Bonus: they offer complimentary coffee while you wait for a table"}
{"text":"Cute little place with delicious brunch options! I get the quinoa power breakfast bowl and it hands down my favorite meal to start the day. We also tried some of the multi grain chocolate chip pancakes and those we the actual BOMB! Only complaint I have is that they don't have sriracha. My boyfriend gets it to go for us on our lunch breaks and it's my favorite since I always have a bottle of sriracha at home. Cholula is there, which isn't half bad. Friendly service and pretty location!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the chickenchanga with a kale tonic. So delicious. Many healthy options for those looking to eat this way. Loved every thing about First Watch."}
{"text":"Wait was long due to the fact that even though we checked in with the yelp  app. The person we talked to didn't know how to properly log us in so we sat and waited........until I got tired of waiting and asked someone else about how long the wait was going to be. The food was ok. The waitress was sweet and helpful. Everyone was helpful but I won't go back.  The loud music was literally on top of us and the cost was a lot for not a lot. And like a reviewer stated, my husband was still hungry and ate the rest of my tasteless pancakes. Good effort  but they need to work on the kinks"}
{"text":"I frequent this location of First Watch almost on a weekly basis and overall, I have good food and good service. Be aware that if you want to go on a weekend morning, you are probably going to have to wait for a table since it isn't a very big restaurant. There are a lot of great servers but I've had a few experiences where my order was wrong, drinks were empty, or I felt forgotten about. The seasonal dishes are usually pretty tasty but I wish they would add some of the popular seasonal menu items to the permanent menu. There aren't very many brunch places up in the Cave Creek/carefree area and I would recommend first watch over other places I've tried."}
{"text":"I come here once a week.  I get an omelet and either a Kale Tonic or a Day Glow.  Very heathy food."}
{"text":"The food and the service was absolutely amazing.  I had the Avocado Toast and my daughter had the Tostadas and we split an order of blueberry pancakes. I will definitely be back... hopefully every weekend."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but very expensive for what you get.  Went with family to First Watch who has moved into the old The Good Egg location at the corner of N Scottsdale Road and Carefree Hwy. We were nicely greeted and quickly seated. We expected the place to be super busy on a late Sunday morning just after church. We were surprised that the place really wasn't all that busy at all.  The restaurant was clean and in good repair. We didn't utilize the restrooms so no report to share on that front.  We ordered pumpkin pancakes and the fig & prosciutto toast. Each entree was about $11.50 each. When the food arrived we found the portions to be on the small side for the price. The pumpkin pancake entree was ONE pancake, one small sausage link split in half and two eggs that were supposed to be basted but in fact were just poached. The pancake was crumbly, falling apart and didn't seem to have anything in it to make it rise. It ready didn't taste like pumpkin either. It wasn't bad just not good either.  The fig and prosciutto toast was two basted/poached eggs and one piece of thick stale toast with three small pieces of prosciutto about a teaspoon of lemon ricotta and some arugula dressed with balsamic vinegar - no figs that we could find.  Breakfast for two with two cups of coffee was $30. The food was luke warm and quite unremarkable.  The service was good and the waitress was nice but all that said, I don't think we will go back. There are just too many choices in breakfast joints that offer food that taste like something. What can I say? I love a well seasoned meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bright, open space - great for groups and kids. We came early on a Saturday and avoided the super long line that was there when we left.   Our group of 6 go all kinds of things, but I'll focus on my Floridian French toast. The fruit was fresh, the brioche bread perfectly cinnamon and the (side of) sausage plump in it's skin. Everything was high quality and well curated. We would go again.  Word of caution: The portions of the carbs are HUGE. One pancake or one piece of French toast is plenty. And the turkey sausage gravy doesn't really have meat in it. It's a meaty flavor, though.   Tip: there's a farmers market on Saturdays right around the corner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to take my daughter. She loves the chocolate chip pancakes. I like that they give to the carafe for coffee. I usually just get the potatoes, which are nice and crispy. Sometimes it gets really packed, so go early. Usually, 8:30-9 am means little or no wait time."}
{"text":"Always a great option for breakfast with several really good healthy choices. I eat here often!"}
{"text":"Tried to grab breakfast with my 4yr old son. Waiting area was packed was told 30min. Watched the waiting room empty and refill. My son was getting antsy and it had been 30 min, seeing several empty tables I asked if it would be much longer. They informed me it would be 30 more minutes.   I told them I had already waited 30 and had seen several people seated before me that came in after me. They attempted to tell I hadn't been there that long even though I had a text they sent me at check in proving I had.   Upon asking for a manager things didn't improve. I then learned that there is an app for check ins that had created the issue and as a result caused the additional wait and left them with several empty tables so that they could ensure they serviced those using the app.  I'm all for technology when applied in a manner that doesn't disrupt. Clearly this business is looking to end walk in business or feels that those whom prefer apps are more in line with their business model.   My business will be taken somewhere that I don't have to complain to receive service."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for breakfast. No greeters at the door after five minutes the couple ahead of us left, we should have too! I ordered the skillet with eggs over easy - got broken egg over cooked and half of the onions and spuds burnt black! Wife had good pancakes. Would have sent mine back but did not want to wait another half hour and not sure it would have been any better!"}
{"text":"We again tried First Watch on FLW...for the fifth time.  We went to The Good Egg almost weekly for several years before it was taken over by First Watch.  We are NOT impressed.  They have many \"interesting\" and \"different\" items on the menu, of which we have tried several.  They're OK...but...we would like to see \"good old bacon and eggs\" and the \"Sun Devil omelette\" and other more \"traditional\" items also included.  We would go there more often if they had more traditional breakfasts.  First Watch is categorized as \"TRADITIONAL\" but they do NOT serve \"traditional\" food.  They reduced the number of tables both inside and outside, which results in longer waits...not so great."}
{"text":"After driving past countless times, my children and I had breakfast here this morning.  We were quickly seated despite it being a Sunday and had a fantastic breakfast.  Clearly the menu caters to the health conscious with plenty of room for those seeking a more traditional breakfast.  The Morning Meditation juice was incredible and shouldn't be missed (a single serving would be good to share with another).  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places!!  Great service, hot and fast food.  French toast and any egg dish is good."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  I have eaten here a few times and the food has been fantastic.  I have tried various things on the menu and it all has been very good.  This trip I had the granola bowl and the blue berry muffin.  The meal was excellent and yummy too.  I like their lemonade that they serve too.  It is fresh and delightful.  I have thought about taking one home and mixing some vodka with it too.  A good sangria would be a nice touch to some of their meals too.  I like this place and think everyone should try it."}
{"text":"The decor is very bright and sunny. The First Watch menu offers some new dishes when compared with the more traditional Good Egg menu. Much more variety! My husband loved the Chilaquiles and really liked the new juice menu. I always have a great experience here when I bring the family for breakfast."}
{"text":"Many years ago, First Watch had the feel of a 'healthy' alternative to Denny's/IHOP and the others, but they have updated their decor, and their menu offerings, both seasonal and regular, just get better and better.  The service is wonderful, especially the carafe of coffee on the table.  The price is equal to the quality and is comparable to most breakfast places.  This is one place that is as close to a guarantee for breakfast or brunch as you are going to get..."}
{"text":"It was my first time at First Watch and I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu! My friend and I came here for lunch. We were really tempted to order off of the breakfast menu, but decided to go with their sandwiches. I had the Monterey Club, which was piled high with turkey, bacon, and avocado and my friend had to the Roast Beef and Havarti. Both sandwiches came with a side of mixed greens or the soup. They also had a lunch special that was 1/2 a a sandwich plus a salad or soup, which caught my eye at first. Everything was so delicious and our waitresses were really nice. I can't wait to go back and have their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and food is bland. Booths are uncomfortable to sit in. It was better when it was the Good Egg."}
{"text":"I love first watch! Great food! I enjoy almost everything on the menu. I can't think of anything I dislike. Healthier or seemingly healthier take on breakfast and lunch. Honestly, inlets, frittatas all good. The turkey sandwich is my favorite. It is delish. Turkey is real turkey not pressed. The staff is typically pretty on top of it and nice. It gets crowded so use the No Wait app.   If you have never eaten here try it. If you have then you will like this location. All good!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times thru the years. Always good. Never had an issue with the quality of the food or the service. All First Watches are similar. This one is very good."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch while in the area.  Very nice little place.  Great options for breakfast or lunch.  Service was pleasant.  Food was great."}
{"text":"Such a great experience!   I ordered the special of the month, the Pumpkin Pancake Breakfast as fall approaches! The chicken apple sausage was to die for! I also ordered one of their fresh squeezed juices, the Morning Meditation. It was made from beets, lemons, oranges, turmeric, ginger and agave.   I went alone and my sever was Kori. She was fantastic! Food was delicious and was made in under 10 minutes! The experience was perfect.   The manager Alan came by to make sure everything was going spectacular. We sat and had a good conversation about the area. Also he was telling me about the \"No Kid Hungry Program\". If you order the Pumpkin Pancake Breakfast, First Watch donates $0.10 to the foundation. Super sweet!   Very clean and lit up. It felt like I was eating at mom's house so it was comforting!  Overall it was more than perfect, and I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"A nice breakfast place.  The staff is friendly, the atmosphere follows their culinary path.  The food is fresh, much healthier than most other breakfast places, but has great taste and variety.  If you are a big eater, you might not leave full, but you will leave happy."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for breakfast!! Great food and amazing service!! I recommend the breakfast tacos with potatoes!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, yummy food.  I don't know that it deserves 4 or 5 stars but it was good.  I had the pancakes which was OK - I've had better.  The bacon wasn't crispy like I like it.  I make better scrambled eggs.  The hubs had the breakfast version of the monte cristo and that was pretty delicious.  He felt guilty eating it afterwards but that's what makes it so good, eh?"}
{"text":"Just another boring chain but when in the burbs looking for something healthy, which is near impossible, First Watch will do but don't expect service any better than Denny's - scratch that, you'd be more appreciated. there."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 15 times since it first opened and the food has always been fresh. I have had varying levels of service, but overall, I usually have a decent experience. I normally try to stay away from chain restaurants, but I love brunch and breakfast and there are not many restaurants like that around Macedonia. I enjoy their seasonal menu and I typically order something from that, but their chickichanga is one of my favorite dishes and I always end up going back to that. I occasionally have their juices and I feel that while they are on the pricey side, they are priced fairly compared to other restaurants. I like their flavor combinations and my favorite is morning meditation."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here...  That staff is friendly and personable.. food is great, fast and consistent.. make sure to say hello to Ray at the front.. great people.. I usually do breakfast but they have a good strawberry salad for lunch too."}
{"text":"The service was reeeaaalllyyy not good. Our server seemed like she hated every part of her job. When we sat down, she was at our table right behind us but didn't even introduce herself. She just said, \"Can I get you some water or coffee or something?\" We said water, she brought it to the table (all of this happening in, I'm not kidding, 45 seconds) and asked us if we were ready to order. Considering we had just sat down 45 seconds ago, we said we would need another minute.  She came back precisely one minute later. We were ready. We both wanted the Traditional breakfast - 2 eggs, a side of bacon or sausage, toast, and potatoes. However, we both asked if we could substitute the toast and potatoes for just additional meat, and we also said that an up-charge would be fine. She acted like this melted her brain. She told us that she couldn't substitute them but she could just get us extra sides of the meat. We said fine.  When she brought our food, my boyfriend's order did not include the extra side of bacon he ordered. She said, \"well when you don't want the toast or potatoes they put tomato slices on your plate instead. But I can go get you the side of bacon...\" ummm yes please?  When she brought it back she slammed it on our table and said nothing and walked away. When we got the check, not only had she not just done an up-charge for us not having potatoes and toast, but she charged us the full price for the meal as if we DID have those things ($9.49) PLUS full charge for the extra sides of meat ($3.49 each, and we got 1 each). So, if you're doing the math at home, that's approximately $13.00 for 2 eggs and 2 pieces of sausage before tax. Oh, and some tomato slices.  I still don't know her name, so I don't even know who to tell you to avoid, which is why I'm saying to avoid this place all together. The food was definitely not good enough to sit through this kind of service and pay a total of $40 for 2 people to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. We sat at the counter, which is a nice table. We get our pot of coffee, so drink away!"}
{"text":"Only open till 2:30 so even though they serve some sandwiches they close early. Hey some people even like breakfast for dinner!  Everything was ripe and fresh when served. Lots of healthy choices too! Portions were not small at all. I asked for egg white only on my breakfast sandwich and it was no problem or upcharge. The line looked long when we arrived after a late church service. But they text you when a table is ready. We were told 15-20 minutes and that is about how long we waited. We will be back! I think I'll treat myself to lemon pancakes next."}
{"text":"Had the Quinoa Chicken pesto and eggs, was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.... great place for a nice breakfast, staff was friendly food and fresh juices were fantastic. Will definitely be coming back here when we are in the area."}
{"text":"*this is my own personal opinion and may not relect your experience*  Sucked.   My wife is gluten intolerant, menu was extremely difficult to navigate. Ok, so food allergies are a pain in the ass.. I get it.. So on to me.   Food was lukewarm. Got an omlette that had the appearance of a premake pie crust, one uniform color.. To their credit, at least it was egg colored. Potatoes we cold. Coffee sucked.   Service was just ok.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went there with my daughter and her two friends this morning for the first time.  It was just OK.  The coffee and bacon was great.  The food was just average for the high price I paid.  Breakfast for 4 people ran me $61.  Solon needs a simple diner in town!"}
{"text":"We started with the juices. My boyfriend loved the Morning Meditation. The seasonal strawberry basil smash was also tasty, though it was basically lemonade. The waiter was cool and gave us a sample of the Kale Tonic, which was also more citrus-y. They give you an adorable glass jug of water but it's just tap so, gross haha.   I had the giant Pumpkin Pancake and it was yummy. More like dessert but that's how I like my pancakes. The chicken sausage was weird and the eggs were cold so the yolks weren't really runny. Sourdough toast with fruit preserves was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Millionaire's bacon - sweet & peppery served with a drizzle of their tasty syrup Cheesey grits - No flavor other than the melted cheese on top. It was more like a corn cake than the runny version of grits I've tried once before. Weird. Not a fan, even with salt. Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich - really interesting, the sweet spiced apple butter is a nice compliment to the savory sausage and the biscuit was great, not too dry. Potatoes on the side are good when they're still hot and crispy.   My only complaint is the food was cold by the time I tried a bite of everything. It was really cold in the restaurant so maybe that's why, but cold eggs and toast and bacon are disappointing."}
{"text":"A wonderful breakfast spot. Healthy choices yes but plenty of \"less healthy\" ones if that is what you want. I had the avacado toast with basted eggs and my wife had the bacon and onion hash. We split a kale juice which was surprisingly delicious. Great strong fresh coffee and friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Went for lunch with a friend. We were seated without wait. The restaurant was quite busy, but they were able to accommodate us timely. Food was all fresh. Avocado toast was delicious. Highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  This past weekend the boy and I were in Arizona for a wedding. We knew nothing about Scottsdale except that it was boilig HOT! We stayed across the street at the sleep inn and woke up Saturday morning for breakfast. After looking up some places for breakfast we decided on this one...Man did we make a wise decision!  This place was busy so we knew it would be good. We got there at 11, so most of the morning crowd had already left.  We were greeted by friendly smiles and excellent service. Our waitress was so nice and super helpful, actually everyone was, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The food: Such a unique menu! I had the chikichanga which is basically a southwestern twist on a breakfast burrito. It has grilled chicken, avocado, egg and some sort of magical sauce that is like nothing I had ever had before! The tortilla is also grilled to a perfect crisp. It came with a small cup of fruit and some home fries, also like nothing you have had before, they are bright red (maybe paprika?). The fruit cup was VERY small, but our waitress said she would get me more fruit if I wanted it.  Mark had the french toast on sourdough and a scrambled egg which he seemed to enjoy since it was completely gone before I had hakf of my food.  Now the service...Superior to most! Since we were from out of town and Scottsdale from what we gathered was a bit small we had no idea what to do, except hide from the sun and brutal heat. We asked our waitress and she was able to give a few suggestions, but when she ran out of ideas she brought someone else over to give us a few more. It was great. She also kept coming back AFTER we had finished to refill our drinks and told us we could hang out as long as we wanted to, no rush.  This place gets an A+ in my book. I was happy to leave AZ, but wouldnt be too upset to take this place with me."}
{"text":"I loved The Good Egg but it was definitely in need of a face lift so I was excited to see the transition to First Watch. I went there today and it seems like they're still working out the bugs. Food was good, no issues there. But it was incredibly hot in the restaurant! With out seeing a thermostat I'm guessing it was 80+. In Arizona. In the summer. Second they announce everywhere they have wifi, so I took my laptop to get some work done. I own a business close by and often will work at Starbucks or Paradise Bakery to get out of the office. While First Watch does have wifi, it's definitely not a \"come and hang\" vibe. My server brought my bill with my meal and immediately asked if I wanted a to go cup for my coffee. With the pushy atmosphere and ridiculous temperature I left as soon as possible and walked over to Starbucks to finish my work. Bummed as I was excited for a new spot."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Had the Chocolate chip pancake it was delicious. It can get crowded at times but they do offer you coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat breakfest  or lunch."}
{"text":"Had an excellent first experience at First Watch! Started out with the million dollar bacon, that was melt in your mouth awesomeness! Enjoyed all the food, including the biscuits & gravy, as well as the avocado toast. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my boyfriend this morning and it was also our first time here! I was very impressed with the food, everything tasted fresh. I got the BLT benedict with avocado and my eggs were poached perfectly, which is hard to get at restaurants usually. My only suggestion would be to sub out the mixed greens for breakfast potatos which I wish the server would of suggested or asked but service was good!  My boyfriend got the breakfast tacos and subbed out the beans for potatos and his was very good, the chicken had good flavor and the pico was delicious!  Not to mention the potatos are well flavored and one of my favorite parts. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! I really like their specials & they have great coffee! Service is friendly and pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've called them (multiple times within a few minutes) to place a to go order with no answer. I love their food but how am I supposed to eat it if two out of four times nobody answers the phone?"}
{"text":"Another satisfied visit for breakfast  I can't think of a better place to eat in will be back next weekend for my birthday meal"}
{"text":"Once again a very enjoyable experience food was extremely good the staff very polite the Pot roast hash skillet was extremely good to bad this was the last weekend for it"}
{"text":"Very clean. Good, natural food choices for a good price & very tasty. The employees were friendly and diligent. Id go back."}
{"text":"My friends & I came to grab a bite here while we were on a trip and LOVED it. The environment, the food, the service was all phenomenal and we will definitely come back when in Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"We made a trip to First Watch on the way to the airport to take our daughter so she could catch a flight to Texas.  I know what you are thinking...\"why would anyone want to go to Texas on purpose?\".  She really does have a good reason, so off we went.  We walked in and they seated us right away.  Our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  She introduced herself as \"Lindsay\", and I am sure she is not the \"Milkoholic Lindsay\" from the E-Trade commercial.  She did a great job for us.  Our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty.  Lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks.   We will be returning for another visit.     The valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast...!"}
{"text":"I got the fresh squeezed orange juice and The Works omelette with seasoned potatoes and toast. Everything was fresh and tasted great! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I haven't even ate yet and I was so impressed by the service I received when I placed my order that I wanted to just drop in and leave a review.  Cory was the one that made this stop for breakfast a place I want to come to more often.  I can't wait to try the food it looks amazing.  I got the chickenchanga and I hear it's one of the best things on the menu.  I was even offered a drink while I wait for my breakfast I ordered to go.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My co worker and I were driving around Phoenix looking for an Ihop and stumbled upon First Watch.  Good thing we did because it was well worth the breakfast stop considering their reasonable prices, good variety, free pitcher of coffee at our table, and very friendly service.  I had something called a Crepegg which is a thin sweet crepe combined with fluffy whipped eggs.  It kind of tastes like an omelet but not really since it has the crepe batter in it.  But my Key West Crepe was very satisfying with avocado, bacon, smoked turkey, tomatoes, and monterey jack cheese.  I did also want to try the banana crunch with granola pancake but you can only eat so much in one sitting!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good like avocado toast and chickichanga, but for the $ the portions suck. One tablespoon of potatoes w ith an $ 11.00 omelette or a drop of salad and Not both. No toast with non omlet eggs like chikichanga. They can afford better helpings for the price! Food is still quite good and fast!"}
{"text":"A fantastic Sunday morning brunch unlike many places in the Pittsburgh area. I've been to Pamela's and other brunch locations, but most seem unappetizing after eating at First Watch.  Something I really liked was First Watch's use of NoWait, the app that let's you get in line before you get there. I wasn't aware of the feature when we went, so we killed 20 - 25 minutes in Barnes and Nobles while we waited. The NoWait feature could've been better advertised, like on their window for easier visibility.   The service was fantastic, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food selection was incredible, it was healthy and didn't make you sigh like you typically do when healthy options are on the menu. The avocado toast, while $4 per half slice, is a must! I've never tasted something so wonderful on toast before. I got the turkey burger, which was extremely flavorful with it's sauces. My partner got the veggie burger with a fruit bowl which he said was excellent.   Their soups all contained dairy, something I was hoping to avoid. It would have been nice to have at least one side soup option that didn't have any dairy as I had to resort to getting \"greens\", which was a pile of dry spinach.   Overall it was a great experience. For the two of us it was around $33, which is typical for a nice Sunday brunch. Although it was just the two of us, it seemed like a great location to have a group of friends and bring your kids. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"\"Good egg\"transformation to \"first watch\" gives me mixed feelings.  The good egg had a great menu with many options.  Not the case anymore.  Food in my opinion, even though healthier now, is flavorless and mixed together in a odd way (ex omelet with side salad ) the menu items are also over priced.  The atmosphere updates are beautiful, very rustic modern approach, makes the changes very impressive when you walk in.  The staff as usual still very friendly, but it is a restaurant soooooo maybe revisit the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent spot with healthy options on the menu. Service is also great. One of my favorites for breakfast."}
{"text":"Over priced breakfast. The good egg was much better. The coffee was better too, loved the flavored coffee."}
{"text":"Today's wait was about 25 minutes because we didn't reserve online. However if you're in the same boat they have benches outside, couch and chairs inside and some water and coffee to start while waiting.   The Elevated Egg Sandwich: smashed in avocado, melted gruyere cheese, Egg over hard (but was supposed to be over easy but I preferred over hard) a couple pieces of bacon, mayo, arugula salad all in between the brioche bread. I was expecting the brioche bread to be soft and fluffy but this one was not-  however still edible. This usually comes with seasoned potatoes but I requested fruit instead which came with a melody of pineapples pieces, honey dew dices, grapes, strawberry cuts and two blackberries. Fruit was a bit on the unfresh side for my taste.   SoCal Burrito (special of the season): vegetarian fed chicken, oozing mozzarella cheese, black beans,  avocado, pico requested on the side and a side of fruit but requested seasoned potatoes. We basically switched out sides!   Morning Glow: fresh oranges, beet, turmeric, agave honey and organic ginger  Today's brunch was pretty good  and the service by our server was superb. Owner/manager and hostess did a duo teamwork job in getting everyone seated for a busy time. Nicely done. Until next time.....  Oh btw- my go to dish is usually the pesto chicken quinoa power bowl. My fave."}
{"text":"There is usually a wait of 5-30 minutes every time I went, but I love this place for breakfast. Customer service is good. Prices are reasonable and food quality is good!"}
{"text":"Second visit today. Very disappointed in service, a lot of employees running around but nobody seemed to be in charge of having tables cleared and getting people seated. After sitting down unwrapped silverware and 2 forks had dried food on them, the water glasses had glue from stickers on bottom of glasses. Food kept coming out one person at a time, some members in party were almost finished by time last person got their food. Food is good but service needs improvements"}
{"text":"Super friendly and nice service with lots of healthy (-ish, let's be honest we ordered the Monte Cristo French Toast) breakfast and lunch options. We split the Market Hash (yum!), the Monte Cristo French Toast (perfect balance of salty and sweet), and I got a Kale Tonic (which my love took a hard pass on and I quite enjoyed). Wish it was closer to where we live as we would come here all the time!"}
{"text":"First Watch, the bathroom. CLEAN! Great service from host, love the menu of choices. About to enjoy my multigrain pancakes, with sausage, eggs and potatoes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for breakfast! I always get their sausage quinoa bowl and it is to the T! From Florida to PA, all their restaurants are amaaazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today by chance. Got the avocado toast with fresh tomatoes and roasted mushrooms instead of eggs and the morning meditation juice. I love all the healthy options! The toast was delicious, very generous with the amount of avocado. It was a little too salty for my taste, but still great. And the juice was fantastic! Cute spot to have a quick breakfast, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We dined at First watch today. There were 4 adults and one child. First we asked them to sweep under our table. It was gross with food and silverware. That was never done. Just was looked at like we were crazy. When I ordered my salad I asked for a few toppings in the side. The waitress response was \"Are you serious!\" There was something wrong with everyone's meal; old crusted cheese, no bacon on a sandwich, cold eggs, stale bread etc. we asked for the manager...he blamed his staff. We were busy and are short staffed. Blah blah blah. Don't make excuses, just make it right. He did comp our meal, which was nice, but I don't think we will be back. I was shocked at the staff...they need to go back for some more training."}
{"text":"Every time I meet someone from Phoenix I ask if they've been to first watch. Its phenomenal breakfast stands out in my mind more than anything else from the trip (not a lot of competition).   Their french toast is incredible. They have some delicious pancakes with blueberries and everything is fresh and a healthier version (whole wheat as opposed to white flour caked in maple syrup).   If I ever go back to Phoenix, I'm going back to First Watch."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the Decour the friendliness of their staff and most importantly the quality of the food and choices. I would highly recommend a visit to this place if you are in town."}
{"text":"I've been eating at First Watch restaurants since they first came to Arizona and I can tell you that this location is by far the WORST for managing their wait list.....now that you can put your name on the wait list thru the app those who just walk in get the short end of the stick...I've never waited so long anywhere and I'll not be back to this location, there are plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"I first tried first watch in Scottsdale and the service there was amazing. However this location is 5 minutes away from my house and is beyond amazing. The service is spectacular and the taste of the food is one I can only get here. All servers make me feel comfortable and joke around while being professional. The environment is quiet and relaxing.   I highly recommend everything on this menu especially any of the hash skillets as well as the Belgian waffle.   I'm glad I have a great place that never fails right by my home. I can't wait to continue to have lunch & brunch here."}
{"text":"The Belgian Waffle was light, airy, and crispy. I enjoyed everything we ate included the elevated egg sandwich. Nothing was super unique though. I liked that they had a pretty juice drink called the morning meditation. If they had some more \"craft\" non-alcoholic morning juice cocktails then I'd be tempted to comeback and try them. Overall, it was a pleasant, cute place to eat with good service. There was a couch by the host stand for us to sit at while we waited for a friend which was helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent. I love the variety healthy breakfast options.... Because they were all so good. I had the scrambled egg whites with turkey patty tomato and English muffin. My fiancé ordered the egg white scramble.. Both entrees were delicious. For me the portion was just right. For him, it was not enough... He ordered two blueberry pancakes and that did it.   They juice here, so I ordered the kale tonic- yum! And 100% natural. Our server was great too.   But the best part is they have coffee available as you wait for your table.   Overall- a good dining experience. Left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Always a winner! There has never ever been a time I've had something I'm not completely satisfied with off of the extensive menu. I'm one of those people who doesn't order the same thing twice if I can help it. The menu at First Watch keeps me coming back because there is so much to choose from. They have items from healthy quinoa and juicing to bacon cheddar  pancakes! I like the 1/2 market veggie sandwich with a cup of soup or fantastic un-boring salad. I'm not a vegetarian, but I would certainly contemplate it if all the food tasted as good as that sandwich. Service is another thing...it's always spot on excellent. I believe they like their jobs because the longevity of the waitstaff is astounding. Even after having a baby, two of the women returned. I like the way they all help each other out by delivering food, refilling drink glasses and doing the register at the end. The restroom is always clean even during the busy times at lunch. Go to First Watch and you'll be able to just close your eyes, point to something on the menu and be surprised at how good it tastes, whatever it is you randomly chose to order! Go and have some food fun!"}
{"text":"I was not terribly impressed by my visit.  The wait for a table was not long however, after ordering our food the wait was over 40 minutes. We ordered sandwiches,  soup, and salad.  When I  got my club sandwich, after the first couple of bites, I realised the bacon was missing! I was afraid to complain as we had to be on our way soon and couldn't chance another 40 minute wait for a sandwich. I appreciate the concept and organic food but I left overall disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast/brunch places go, First Watch is pretty run-of-the-mill. Their menu is fairly standard, their tables are close together (read: no romantic ambiance), and the wait times are pretty high for what you end up getting.   Here's what I can remember about the experience: we waited a long time to get in, we were four inches from the next table, we had to flag down our server multiple times for various things like ordering, refills, and the check, and the price was so-so.   I don't remember what I got. Probably a benedict? That should tell you how memorable the food is. I guess if you're in the area it's an alright option, but it won't be a standout experience. At least the parking's plentiful."}
{"text":"First Watch restaurant review So so Potatoes with onions are good and would be great if a bit more crispy.  Bland Chorizo tastes like Turkey. Bread would be great if it was real butter instead of Margarine. Fresh juices are tasty. Preserves are delicious. And why would you take a southern comfort food like biscuits and cover it with turkey sausage gravy- yuck!"}
{"text":"First Watch has been a favorite spot of mine for healthy food options for many years. They are friendly, personable and they have good food and service! That's hard to find sometimes. The waitress remembered me even after several months, refreshing!! They are also clean and that's a definite plus! Just simply a great place to eat for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive and friendly staff ... Only complaint, first watch potatoes are nothing fresh or flavorful."}
{"text":"First watch is incredible. They have a fresh seasonal menu and your food is always made when it's ordered. I usually get they're Florentine Benedict with greens instead of potatoes and it's absolutely delicious. The greens have a delightful lemon flavor that goes well with the Florentine Benedict. They also have a fresh juice bar for a healthy morning dose of vitamins. I particularly like their morning meditation juice which has the amazing flavors of orange, lemon, turmeric, organic ginger, agave nectar and beet."}
{"text":"Great service and food!! Highly recommend this place. Lindsay took great care of us, even offered coffee to go!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast after a barre3 workout and this definitely hit the spot. Food was bomb. We ordered the Chickichanga and the Farm Stand Breakfast Tacos. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, clean restaurant, and the manager is super nice!  He made sure I caught my plane on time! Anyway, try the Floridian French Toast or the Banana Granola Pancakes... Yum!"}
{"text":"Avocado toast is delicious. Best that I've ever tried ANYWHERE. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so cozy and comfortable. And their decor is awesome."}
{"text":"We loved the decor of First Watch. Everyone was super friendly and worked together during a busy breakfast time. I ordered the BLT eggs Benedict and hubby ordered ricotta cheese pancakes. Both were yummy. We loved the extra coffee in the carafe and extra water. No need to flag down a waitress for more. Keep up the good work! We will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch! This location seems smaller than others, so check Nowait beforehand. Heads up though if you are planning to do work here, the WIFI DOES NOT WORK."}
{"text":"On our way to another breakfast location, we found First Watch. With only one car in front, we figured a quick breakfast would be nice. Walking in I almost turned around with the sight of the manager sitting eating his own breakfast,  glancing over at us standing and continued to take a few more bites. About ready to turn around and leave, he got up and without any acknowledgement or welcome, grabbed menus and sat us down grumbling our writers name which we couldn't hear. Thank goodness our waiter was friendly. We got drinks and our order taken quickly. As we waited, it was hard not to watch this \"manager.\" After eating, he left his food for the other workers to clean and sat in eye shot a little office with the door wide open to see him just doing nothing. Truly needs something else to do besides eating and resting or at least hide it better from paying customers.....such a distraction. Food was pretty delicious. We had the Avocado Toast with two eggs and French Toast.  However, chocolate muffin I ordered as a side  tasted as if from Costco a few days earlier (pretty dry and the top just peeled off.) and the side of fruit was not too fresh tasting either. But again, that Avocado Toast....YUMMY! Overall, we might go back because it was so good and waiter was super nice.  However, whomever was the opening manager - he really needs to be told to smile and eat before the place opens or go on break; so proper, friendly customer service as experienced from the other workers can be the highlight of the visit."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with First Watch! The parking lot appearing not too busy on a Saturday morning, we figured we would stop in to see how this new restaurant was compared to its previous long lasting restaurant . Nice atmosphere and decor. The reasonably priced selection and quantity of food choices was fantastic; making it difficult to choose but almost guarantees a second visit!    Food came fairly quickly! Everything but the potatoes tasted AMAZING! Beyond words good!  (Potatoes were cold....not sure why such an awkward quality/temperature difference between main food and this side.)   As previously stated by other reviewers, the  waitress did bring bill immediately after receiving food along with the offer to fix my remaining  coffee to go offer. I personally didn't mind too much but I could defintely see how this can be interpreted this as pushy or rushed for some. I get the typical  \"training\" as previously explained but just hold off a bit more....wait for customers to eat a few bites first to avoid this to be a distraction from the fabulous food experience.) What I did find interesting was our waitress at that point disappeared....I guess her job was done as we never saw her again. So, no water refill (cute glass bottle the water came in was empty) or recheck on the coffee to go offer (change my mind - but oh well!).   With that said, the \"main\" food (not potatoes) makes this place 100% revisit worthy!!!! Just fantastic!!!! My rating is totally stomach driven! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite breakfast in carefree.  Lots of healthy and tasty options. Good prices.  I had the avocado toast. Very fresh. We shared an order of cinnamon chip pancakes.  Waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Wonderfully healthy options and they were super helpful in providing vegan options..."}
{"text":"The food is good but service was unexpectedly slow on a Sunday morning, a day where you would expect there to be more staff members to accommodate a larger breakfast demand. Wait time was accurate and they offer text alert/mobile app reservations."}
{"text":"had the salmon 'fritatta', it was flat with chunks of salmon instead of flaked throughout. The eggs were way overcooked. Sent it back, got the scrambled eggs with waffle. The waffle was delicious, the syrup warmed. The eggs looked and tasted like they were poached and then scrambled. They were disgusting. Bacon tough, sausage good. Won't be back, ever, to any of them. It's a chain, why should I think it would be different elsewhere?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this breakfast restaurant... Avocado toast!   I heard this location was not so good but it's close to home so we wanted to try it ourselves.,.  Sooo yummy!  And the service could not have been any better!    There are so few breakfast restaurants with health choices and this places has a ton to choose from!..  I want to eat here every day!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The service was delightful, our waitress was attentive and all smiles, the food was simple but delicious and filling. There were many options and everything was fresh, even the Orange juice that they make onsite! I highly recommend stopping in for lunch or breakfast. The price was on point and there were many healthy and tasty options. Great for any day. Ask for Hannah, she was delightful :)"}
{"text":"I visited First Watch this morning with my family, including a 3 year old granddaughter.  We were greeted immediately and seated in a comfy booth.  From that point forward, we were essentially ignored for 20 mintues until we stopped a food runner who took pity on us.  She came back to take our order, then we had another wait for coffee.  The food came out at a reasonable time.  We finally saw our waitress who quickly apologized for our earlier wait. Then she disappeared and we never saw her again. Finally, part of the family left and I went to the cashier pay station to request our bill and pay.  The menu is great, the food was good, but, frankly, the very poor service wasn't worth it.  I won't go back until I see many reviews saying that service has improved."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and inexpensive! Not very often do you find those three words in the same sentence. Love this place for lunch. They have great lunch specials and the staff is super friendly and fast. They have a great half and half special for $8 and everything is wonderful. Their butternut squash soup is awesome. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't say that I'm a huge fan of First Watch. While it's a good place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch, it's typically not my first choice. By the looks of the menu and the overall vibe of the place, you'd think they're trying to take a healthy approach to breakfast..until you look at the calories of each menu item. I don't typically count calories so that doesn't bug me too much. However, I've eaten here a few times and have not been blown away by any of my experiences. The food is just ok to me."}
{"text":"Simply a great place to eat! Good food and nice atmosphere. Went with a fairly large group and was treated very well. Had a great place to sit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots! We go here every Saturday after baseball practice. Haven't had a dish I didn't like and they have the best coffee."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning for the first time and upon arrival I was impressed.  The restaurant is open and bright and there was free coffee in the lobby, definitely a kind of place that I want to start my morning.  After being seated, a coffee pot and water pitcher were brought to the table.  I really like this as I tend to drink water faster than it can be refilled and it prevented me from drinking too many cups of coffee, which tends to happen when someone else is pouring.    The food was good as well.  I ordered the greek fetish omelet.  It was overall tasty, but I felt like they skimped on the filling.  I like a full omelet and this was far from it.  The english muffin was normal and the side potatoes were good, but nothing remarkable.  My Aunt had the chikichanga and she loved it.  I would probably try one of their more specialty items if I came back again."}
{"text":"Just amazing.  Millionaires bacon totally worth it.  Our waitress was super helpful.  Defiantly visit this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I'm giving this place a four stars only because I've been three times, but my goodness, the food and service were great those three times! I will change this review (for better or worse) once I have gone a few more times, but I definitely recommend! Great spot for bringing guests and absolutely adorable. Also most items on the menu were vegetarian or could be made vegetarian friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the atmosphere and service is lacking. We went for breakfast and did not have to wait long. Our coffee and water were brought quickly, but when we asked for another minute to look at the menu our waitress forgot about us. Over 10 minutes passed without her coming near our table or glancing in our direction. I finally had to flag down a different waitress for assistance. And it was hot in there. We barely touched our coffees because we were too warm already. This isn't a place to chat since it is pretty loud as well.  My pancakes were good and crispy and the seasoned potatoes were cooked well. Maybe takeout is the way to go here."}
{"text":"I will never eat pancakes from another place! First Watch pancakes (and all of their food, really) are the best. My favorite are the Banana Granola crunch or carrot cake pancakes. But only order one- they are enormous! The rest of the food and their artisan toast is better than any other breakfast or brunch place around. You can't go wrong here. Their severs are all friendly and there is little turnover, so if you visit regularly, they start to know your orders. Great food, great value, and great service!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and filling delicious selection's.  I highly recommend this place for anyone who really value the taste of home cooked breakfast. Yummy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to First Watch's various Phoenix locations for years.  I've consistently had positive dining experiences each time.   I brought my family to the Scottsdale Promenade location on a busy Saturday morning for breakfast.  We were seated by a friendly host after a short wait (we were told 15 minutes and were seated in 10 minutes).  The server was attentive and friendly.  The food (as always) is fresh, served quickly and delicious.  The First Watch Potatoes are delicious.  Besides traditional eggs, pancakes and omelettes, there are a variety of dining options (wraps, salads, sandwiches) for brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"So I ordered a Togo order for a Bracado. A bacon omelette that looked really good. It's 7:40ish on a Saturday in a relatively normal capacity with many open booths. I ordered and took a seat at the very comfy couch in the waiting room. The seats available looked nice enough but I chose the couch as I had the pick of the whole place. No other Togo orders or waiters. I start to browse Facebook and Imgur just losing myself in time. More people arrive and take seats and another Togo patron arrives to get his order. I keep browsing until I notice the other Togo patron now has his 2 bags of food and 4 drinks and is being escorted to his car with his treasure of delicacies. I look at the time and notice that it's now 8:15 and no omelette. I ask the young man on his way in about my order and he scurries to check on it. He returns a few minutes later and says \"just a minute\". I go back to browsing and sure enough 5 minutes later I receive my prize.   A 12$ omelette that has almost no filling, a few scraps of Avarado and a side of sour cream. All for just 30-40 minutes wait. Yea I could have also had a side of bread or potatoes (for extra). No wonder they have a comfy couch, with that wait time.   Save your money, go to jack in a box across the way. I live across the street and I'll gladly drive across town for the competitor, Snooze, tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great diner ambiance and a relatively sophisticated diner menu with seasonal additions - loved it!"}
{"text":"Very good service and meal on a busy Sunday morning! We would visit the Good Egg from time to time and it was......ok, but now we will visit this location more with the great menu and a typical North Scottsdale pricing!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on recommendation of a colleague. I found the environment a little sterile or stark. Wait staff was ok, but all were young people who seemed disconnected or disinterested. I guess I was looking for a little more private, local owner feel. Food was non-descript neither great nor bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"We are visiting here from Minneapolis and few people recommended this place.  We had an amazing breakfast.  To add to the fun, our waitress was fun and quirky and fast.  Also, the food came out literally after 8 min of us ordering....no joke.   If you are in Phoenix,  def. try this place if you are big on breakfast :-)"}
{"text":"Soooo good. Had the breakfast tacos and their million dollar bacon. This place hits the spot."}
{"text":"A good place, but perhaps a little... confused.  We had never been to a First Watch before, so were excited to try this one out. Our hostess took great pains to tell us how this location was focusing on using fresh, local ingredients in everything. She then set down a pot of coffee for us and let us look over the menu.  We poured the coffee and realized the only creamer we could get wasn't fresh or local, but was little pre-packaged creamer cups on the table. Being a fan of local coffee roasters, when she came back I asked where the coffee beans came from and she said it was their own brand and packaged out of state. She made a point of telling me I could buy some when I left.  So the first two things the fresh and local focused place did was offer us fake creamer and out of state roasted beans. We were getting nervous.  Fortunately things picked up from there. I tried the avocado toast, which was fantastic. No skimping on the avocado here, and it was lightly seasoned to let the natural taste shine through. My wife had a skilled, which was also really well done and tasty.  They have a nice section of their menu focusing on healthy and lighter fair, which I'm looking forward to trying on future visits.  We could tell the staff was new, but they were trying hard and I'm sure they will work out the kinks shortly. The place is cute and decorated well, and their patio looks promising when it cools down a bit.  I was surprised when I was asked to name a tip amount at the register rather than being able to write it on the receipt like most places, but perhaps that is how all the First Watches do it.  So I think my concern came from the way they set expectations. If they hadn't been touting fresh and local so much I probably wouldn't have wondered about it. The coffee was good no matter where it came from, but I do think the creamer-cups were a bit cheesy.  We'll definitely be back, but we'll pay less attention to their branding and focus on finding more dishes we like as much as the ones we had today."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't the same ol same ol and so we settled for First Watch. This location used to be a U.S. egg I believe. I had been to the First Watch location out in Tuscon and was pleased with the quality ans was happy to learn that there was now a location near me. First Watch is known for their fresh and health conscious food and is only open for breakfast and lunch. After we were seated I ordered a coffee and my son an apple juice. The coffee was great and they leave the pot so you dont have to wait to get it refilled. I ordered off the seasonal spring menu, having the Croque Madame and my son ordered the eggs Benedict. Bothe were delicious and had  more of a savory taste to them. The one issue I had was that it seemed that my dish had a little too much dijon mustard on it. The dijon is supposed to give it just a hint to elevate the taste of the dish. The amount on mine over powered the bite. Other wise it was a great breakfast and a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I got the Breakfast Sandwich and it was very delicious and presentable. My server was a very kind and sweet old lady. I recommend that you dine in :)"}
{"text":"I would've given it 5 stars however, it wasn't a mind blowing experience. It is very clean & beautiful. Our waiter was smiling at 8:30am & pleasant. I ordered the classic Eggs Benedict with a side of turkey sausage. I loved that the meal was fresh & organic! I've had better turkey sausage though. They were a little soggy. I would return here again & bring some people!"}
{"text":"Excellent friendly staff, fast food.  Loving eating here, I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.  Sometimes the wait sucks, but that's why it is at Crocker Park, to walk around."}
{"text":"It's bland old white people food, if you like that sort of thing ;) Sort of like a more pricey version of Denny's."}
{"text":"Really awesome breakfast! We had the triathlete omelette, the bacado omelette and split a waffle. Everything was great! The coffee was hot and fresh, the food was perfectly prepared and the staff was top notch. Definitely recommend a stop at First Watch!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Sunday morning around 9:30-10 and there was about a 20 minute wait. No big deal for a Sunday morning, so we waited, sat in their comfy oversized seats and looked over the menu.The place is wide open, modern decor and has plenty of seating inside and out.  After we were seated, service was friendly and fast. We ordered a chile chorizo frittata w/ potatoes and a side of biscuits & gravy to share. The food did take a little bit to get to the table but, the place was very busy and we were in no hurry so - no worries.   Overall, the food was great! No complaints. Came out hot, cooked just right and ingredients were fresh and yummy. One knock on the biscuits were a touch dry but, the plentiful turkey-sausage gravy made up for it! Check came fast and easy to pay on way out.  One note - After we were seated the wait to get in ballooned very quickly - almost to a comical point when it became tough to even leave the place with so many bodies inside and out! Still, that is a great problem to have for them and must say something about the food. So, in short - wait times may change in an instant!"}
{"text":"We've always liked First Watch and were excited to see them come to N. Peoria, but things have changed.   Wait staff was OK. Interior and seating fine.  I have always had the Eggs Benedict and it's always been the best, but not anymore. Hollandaise sauce was tasteless and potatoes are just so-so. We also had an omelette and it was nothing special."}
{"text":"We had such a lovely breakfast here on Black Friday. It was our first time at this location and our waitress, Le'Ausha was wonderful! Not only was she attentive and so welcoming, she really went the extra mile to talk about the menu and make her suggestions of things we should also consider trying on future visits. It was really nice!!! The food is so good! We each had a different item and not a single one of us left hungry! My daughter had the breakfast tacos and when it arrived she thought t was not going to be enough to she had one whole one left over. She loved the chorizo sprinkles and is a fan of most all things avocado. My sister had the Trifecta with bacon. She loves that she has found a place that will make her bacon as crispy as she likes it (2 steps from burned). I myself, chose the works omelette but omitted the tomatoes and onions. It was absolutely perfect. The mushrooms were not overdone and very flavorful. I loved the amount of meat and cheese and left full. It not feeling fat. It was a healthy full and I really like that. This is defiantly a keeper spot for us!"}
{"text":"Visited Tempe location.  Same great tasting food and service as I enjoyed in California.  Always looked forward to breakfast here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Smiling welcome when you enter the door. Atmosphere is incredible and the food was perfect! Love finding new spots."}
{"text":"It seems ghetto from the outside but once you go inside, you'll instantly change your mind. The inside looks nice and well maintained. Every morning is somewhat packed as the location is surrounded by hotels and corp buildings. I ordered one chocolate chip pancake (one is enough because the serving is fairly large), and the oatmeal. Both were good. However my S.O. ordered the avocado toast and the strawberry smash. I gotta admit, I liked that order better. The avocado has a citrus~y flavor which is interesting in a good way. The strawberry smash is highly recommended. I wanted to change my fresh squeezed OJ to that drink. Staff is accommodating too. I'd give this place an 8/10."}
{"text":"I went to 'First Watch' Monday, Sept 12 at 11:30 a.m.  After standing at an empty hostess station for almost 5 minutes, with employees looking at me and continue walking by, a young man finally approached.  I requested a server by name, 'Lori'.  He wasn't sure if she was working (how can that be when she had been there at least 5 hours?) Anyway, he seated me in a section that would 'be hers if she is here'.  Lori was working.  I give Lori 5 stars on Service, and the food 4 Stars.  The reason for the 1 star is as follows:  The hostess stand was to the left of my table.  I was dining with a friend.  The hostess was unaware I requested Lori.  She asked if I would like her to process my check and 'put the tip in an envelope'. (the tip was a $10 cash tip.)  I said yes.  Talking with Lori's boyfriend yesterday, I learned Lori thought my friend and I had stiffed her.  Definitely NOT.  People, if you are tipping in cash, please hand it to your server, as it is apparent an employee is helping him/herself to the contents of the 'envelopes'.  There were numerous employees in and out of the hostess station, so it is anyone's guess who helped themselves to the tip."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one morning and it was yummy! I had a potato skillet (can't remember the name) and my mom had french toast. The food was made fresh and tasted great.    I've dined at other First Watch locations and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Service really sucked. Only thing that helped them out was their food was pretty good. Unique options like avocado toast and juices that most other places don't have. If you can, avoid getting Greg as your server at all costs. We sat down and the glasses on our table were already used/still dirty, he tried to tell me I was wrong till I showed him the glass with full lipstick stain on it. Shut him up real quick. Three tables sat and got their food before he even came back to get our order. He brought us new glasses of water and still another had lipstick on the side. Don't blame your dishwasher to cover your ass, just apologize. I have an allergy to eggs, and tried to ask what I can substitute (most places will sub any side except protein like bacon, which is always fine with me). He was not understanding at all, didn't try to help me find an alternative and made me feel like it was my fault. I wish good egg was still th"}
{"text":"First time I've seen the \"get on the waiting\" list link on Yelp, what a cool option!!!  I called ahead to see how long the wait was at this restaurant and then clicked the get on the waiting list link.  It told me we had 8 parties ahead of us and was pretty close to the time she quoted over the phone.  We got there within the 10 minutes allowed and there were now only 4 parties wait.  The App Kept track (as I did) for each group seated and just as promised we were seated on time in order, epoch!!!!  Now for the review ....The service was phenomenal,  so so busy but we never felt rushed or ignored.  Our every request was fulfilled with a quick response and a smile.  The food is always good and this is my absolute favorite pot of coffee in northern Ohio.  Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Best breakfast eats we've found so far in the NEO suburbs of Solon/Chagrin Falls.  Wholesome, flavorful and a varied menus that supports both the millennial as well as old school palate.  Superseed high protein pancakes with a rasher of million dollar glazed bacon on the side, paired with responsibly sourced excellent coffee and my daynis off"}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying out first watch and it won't be my last watch ;). I will definitely be returning. I love breakfast and this place rocker my socks off.  Upon walking in the hostess immediately greeted us with a smile and added our name to the wait. We were sat within the timeframe given which can be hard to come by at some restaurants. I had the Italian hash skillet and oh my gosh I can't wait to have it again. Our server was busy but took great care of us. If you like juice get the fresh squeezed orange juice, it was soooo good. For the portions and quality the prices were definitely on par as well.   First watch! Good job! I'll definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late breakfast and I don't have many complaints. We tried one of their juices from their juice bar which had an interesting flavor to it. Overall the food was pretty good. It wasn't anything over the top but it was good. Since they say they are good for brunch I wish they would serve mimosas or bloody marys. Either way everything was good and you can tell that the fruit and vegetables are very fresh. Gotta love the fresh produce!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  We used to come when it was the egg place (Good Egg?).  They changed the decor to be more hip and added a lot of healthy options as well as fresh juices.  We're fans!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I frequent the Solon first watch a couple times a month on Saturday or Sunday mornings. They have such a great menu with great healthy options! Never had a bad meal! The price is great as well, you really get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff and superb food!   The avocado toast is a 5 thumbs up from my youngest kid!  Enjoyed the protein bowl and the eggs were cooked perfect!  Can't wait to bring the whole family back!"}
{"text":"These seasoned potatoes... Let me tell you. The seasoning must be crushed heaven and magic flakes."}
{"text":"3rd time here. They were very busy, (9 am Sat morning) so we waited about 15 minutes. After being rushed to a table that was still damp from being wiped down, I immediately noted that the silverware and glasses were horribly water spotted and dirty with fingerprints. The coffee mugs were far worse with sticky syrup and lipstick smudges. When the server finally showed up, I pointed it out, and she took our drink order and then hastily grabbed them and later came back with cleaner(?) glasses and mugs. The water glass smelled of the chemical used in the dishwasher. We weren't ready to order, which appeared to irritate the server even more. She left and returned about 10 minutes later, which was simply way too long to wait.  I ordered an advertised special and my wife ordered a standard menu item with some changes. When they arrived, I noted mine did not look like the advertised item and was missing some ingredients. I had to wait about 8 minutes before I could flag down our server, who had yet to come by to ask if everything was to our liking. When she did finally show up after waving at her, I asked if my order was supposed to include additional ingredients and she immediately left and brought back the missing part. No apology was given, nor was there any suggestion to replace with a fresh and warm meal or the offer to remove it from our ticket. However, she did blame it on the person who brought the meal out. I requested that she remove it from our ticket, which she did. There was never an apology given.   The cashier asked rotely how our meal was but did not wait for, nor seemed interested in a reply. It is quite evident that the restaurant management and staff were unprepared for increased business (first day of the month - after a payday - and a direct mailer had been sent out... really?) and EVERY employee there (wait and kitchen) were poorly trained by management and ill-prepared to handle the increased business properly and professionally.  In my previous experiences, the food has been exceptional, prepared and served correctly. That is the reason for the two stars. If I were a first-time customer, I would have given a one-star rating.       I hope they get their act together as I do like the quality of their food. We will see....."}
{"text":"Been here waiting a bit, not too sure if I like the idea of checking in ahead of time, guess it makes sense, but when you physically check in, and people walk in and get seated before you, it's a little off-putting. The wait list keeps saying there is only 3 parties ahead of us, but I swear they have seated more than that ahead of us already. Just gonna wait it out for now."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Clean, friendly service, fresh food, unique combinations, calorie count listed on menu. Good coffee. Nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices for quality of food."}
{"text":"Joneen is awesome! Very nice and always smiling. My wife and I have been going to this location for years but now can only visit maybe once a month. She's great with our kids and accommodating every time. Ray the manager is incredible also, seems like he knows everybody by name. Great place and the food is good too"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast menu.  We had the breakfast sandwich on brioche bun. Delicious. And carrot cake pancake. Lots of other fun choices. Great spot."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing every time I go! I've had multiple different items here and it's always delicious. JJ always provides great service and is very kind!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food looked good tasted wonderful. I found this place via YELP and was not disappointed. Next time I am in Phoenix I will definitely be stopping by.  The house potatoes were especially flavorful. I ordered bacon avocado Omelet daughter ordered elevate egg with avocado on a bun. She loved it too."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. Egg white omelette was great. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. Toast is AMAZING."}
{"text":"The food is bland, boring and overpriced.  Looks better than it tastes. The open floor seating concept is unappealing"}
{"text":"It's a close by place for me to have lunch/brunch. You get lots of good options - healthy and yummy! If Phoenix weather allows you to sit outside, on a lazy Sunday, the patio sitting with sprinklers makes Sunday brunch just wow! I like the freshly brewed coffee with hazelnut milk and Italian wedding soup! Their frittata rustica is also really good! The only negative I would say is the slow service. It could be really really slow! Other than that, I love this place!!"}
{"text":"We sat down, it was not busy, plenty of wait staff on. We sat and watched three tables that came in after us get taken care of and not one waiter or waitress even said I'll be right with you. We got up to leave. Then a waiter asked if we were taken care of. We asked for a manager. Marcus, the manager offered us free breakfast, we declined. We did not want a free meal. We are not complainers. We went to another restaurant (which was already busy) and within seconds of sitting down someone got us drinks."}
{"text":"The place has gone downhill.  It smells is dirty and food not as fresh as it used to be."}
{"text":"Another wonderful breakfast at the downtown First Watch. Father's day morning with the family and the service was excellent. The Works omelet was perfectly cooked to order, sans onions; and when we asked for the blueberries to come on-the-side of our blueberry pancake, they never even blinked! Oh, and the new style potato side, very tasty - we couldn't get enough. In a word, YUM."}
{"text":"After my last review of First Watch I received a very nice email asking me to try the place again so I did and was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the exact same breakfast and it was delicious.  The cheese was melted inside the omelet, the avocados were fresh, they remembered the pico de gallo and the eggs weren't rubber.  My husband's meal was very good as well so we were happy.  I wanted to come back onto Yelp and give a new review and thank First Watch for asking me back.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time at First Watch. At 75 years I have sampled many a breakfast. Their Farmland Scramble was the best I ever eaten. Now my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"OMG! One of my best ever restaurant breakfasts! Bacado omelet! Quality everything including the server. Nice atmosphere, clean & comfortable. Definitely a do-over!!"}
{"text":"Was impressed as soon as I walked in: the lobby and restaurant are super clean, and there's a warmth about the place (think \"Cracker Barrel\" but fresher, lighter, and not cluttered).  Menu is very impressive, clean eating options, and full allergen info on the website.  Had the chicken salad spinach salad (fresh and yummy) and the kale tonic on the spring menu (tastes awesome, close your eyes if you need to!). Service was super fast and prices extremely affordable.  I'm from out of town, wish I had one in my backyard!"}
{"text":"Had the chickichanga and it was awesome. The potatoes were great too. We have been here twice this week. Love the app that tells your place in line when they are on a wait. Our service has been a little rushed, otherwise good experience overall"}
{"text":"This is one of the many national and in-state chains which are all very popular.  They are generally busy for reason; healthy, generous, and beautifully prepared and brunch portions for a decent price.  From quinoa power bowls to egg and meat bowls and unique gourmet pancakes, French toast, and Belgian waffles to unique omelets to mixed juices.  This place reminds me of upscale resort food."}
{"text":"Do not bother. Service was hostile when asking about simple breakfast options, like pancakes and eggs. Then over easy came out well done, the potatoes were tasteless, the muffin came at the time we received our check. I would not give it one star if zero stars was an option. We will never go back; it was that bad."}
{"text":"We stop here frequently for a quick breakfast or lunch. Service is always very friendly and quick and unobtrusive, indoors or out.  There's a lot of good stuff on the menu, including some creative and unique options, so I never have trouble finding something tasty. The glaring omission, though, is a good-ole-fashioned egg sandwich... very odd not to see it here.  Sometimes the waitress will get the kitchen to make one for us, but sometimes we have to assemble something ourselves. Overall, tasty and reasonably priced breakfast fares."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our first visit to First Watch this past Sunday and didn't have a positive experience that would encourage us to return.  It was a Sunday afternoon so the 30 minute wait to be seated was expected; however everything that followed was not.  Our waitress stopped by and took our drink order and returned 10 minutes later with our drinks to take our food order.  After ordering we did not see our waitress for refills or updates on our food status.  We sat waiting for 30 minutes before I spotted another server carrying our food out and proceed to take it from table to table trying to find the rightful owner.  After about 4 minutes and multiple table stops it finally made it to us.  My husband had ordered the works omelet without onions; however the omelet he received both had onions and was cold.  I had ordered the  1/2 sandwich and  1/2 salad and while my sandwich was quiet good it was impossible for me to enjoy my salad due to the tiny plate it had been served on.  The cobb salad should have either been tossed before serving or needs to be served on a plate or in a bowl that you can enjoy it without half the salad falling onto the table.    All in all we saw our waitress twice the entire time we were seated and only ever received 1 refill of our iced teas.  After our food was delivered she did stop in to see how it was at which point my husband pointed out the onion issue but after waiting 30 minutes for food we opted not to send it back as it was certain to take another long delay.   This information was sent to management after our experience and after 5 days haven't received a reply.  To me this does not point to an establishment that is looking for feedback when things don't go right and as such we will not be returning."}
{"text":"It would of been great, if it wouldn't been for the cockroach on the table and a stale orange-cranberry muffin served. I should have taken picture. Until today, I've had great experiences there. Oh, the waitress was trying TOOO hard to please, this could be annoying."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to eat for breakfast is the traditional style breakfast and this restaurant served up a beautiful and delicious plate of exactly that! Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch before but this was my first time at this location. I was afraid that since we were going on a weekend that it would be a long wait but we only waited about 10 minutes before being seated. We ordered the turkey sausage biscuits and gravy and the farmer's biscuit sandwich off the seasonal menu and it did not disappoint. The biscuits and gravy comes with two fluffy biscuits, eggs, and seasoned potatoes. The gravy was delicious and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly.  The biscuit sandwich had sausage, argula, and egg and apple butter on it, too bad it's seasonal but we'll be back to get it before it's gone!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting First Watch and still  loved it ! The pancakes are so good!!! They bring you a whole pot of coffee so you don't have to wait for refills.  Love all the healthy options!  Will go back again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"As far as chain breakfast spots go, this isn't half bad. I'd pick it over the Good Egg for décor alone, which is much less country kitchen and more...well...this location looks kind of strange. It's like walking into an 80s after-school soda fountain shaped like a Der Wienerschnitzel. The food? Not mind-blowing, but well above average, too. The eggs are cooked just right, and I happen to think the fresh veggies in the omelettes are about as crisp and tasty as you're going to find. The coffee is on par with Denny's, so take that for what it's worth. I'll take this over an IHOP any day, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our service the last two times I have visited this place for breakfast. Yesterday we waited an hour in half for our food and there were only 4 of us. Watching everyone else get their food. Terrible service and management.  Plus they didn't get our orders right. One of my friends complained and got a coupon for a free meal. What about the rest of us?  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the Traditional breakfast- eggs over easy, bacon, toast and potatoes.  Very good- bacon was crispy (like I like it) eggs, bread and potatoes were all delicious. Great place for a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"There are better places to eat breakfast where they don't over charge you and for that matter where they post prices... this place does not have prices posted online . I found that very odd.... the food is mediocre, service was below average, restaurant was empty, one of the tell tale signs of mediocrity. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I ever had. We used to love coming here as The Good Egg. It is not a large restaurant and 50% of the tables were empty but we were required to wait 15 minutes. The server rushed us in ordering. I ordered an omelet with veggies. I did not notice there was goat cheese on it. I hate goat cheese. It tastes like dirty feet to me, but that was my error. The portions were skimpy.  The broccoli in my omelet was so undercooked as to be inedible. The prices were very high. The food was served cold. When we left we counted 35 people total waiting inside and outside the restaurant with 7 empty tables inside the restaurant and several on the patio area.  We will never come back.  Why is this place so popular?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, or for brunch. We ordered the skillet with only veggies and split it. It came with potatoes and a variety of vegetables and since there were two of us we asked that the two eggs that come with the skillet be cooked separately since we like our eggs cooked differently. They brought out one skillet with two plates for the eggs. Also one of us has a dairy allergy and they brought the cheese on the side. It was the perfect portion for each of us, not too much not too little, especially if you are trying to watch your weight - you won't have any leftovers. The interior is really nice and roomy with plenty of natural lighting which makes for a very nice dining experience especially on a nice day out."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast, and at first sight the interior was very spacious like a modern/country restaurant. We ordered the chicken chimichanga which comes with a hollandaise sauce smothered on top of a scrambled egg omelette stuffed with cheese, a sausage type of meat, avocado on the side, a dollop of sour cream on top and country potatoes seasoned perfectly. You also get a small fruit in the side. We also got the skillet which consisted of sausage, potatoes, eggs. It usually comes with cheese but since one of us has a dairy allergy, we got the cheese on the side and I put it on my potatoes. They also have some fresh juice drinks- very interesting mixes. I didn't try them but will next time. I got a coffee. Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE this place as an easy go to brunch spot. Their menu is very affordable and they have numerous options for diners with dietary restrictions. Dined here with some vegan friends and they all enjoyed delicious meals. Food is definitely a step up from a run of the mill diner, but is definitely still casual enough to bring the whole family at any time of the day. If you're looking for something fun to try they have a selection of fresh juices that change with the season!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is charming, food is mediocre, prices on the high side and staff unhappy to see you!"}
{"text":"Phew! No line on a Saturday morning?! Is this breakfast heaven? OK, so maybe the big golf event thing down the road snatched up all the people? It was empty(at 11 a.m.! On a Saturday!) Fine by me, since I DGAF about sports and I do GAF about breakfast foods.  The S.O. and I moved up here in August from Tucson. We were excited to see Good Egg because we have them in Tucson and we were fans. We were able to visit a couple times as Good Egg, now we came in to try as First Watch. Unless it was a money thing, I don't really see the need for a new name/ menu. We liked GE, and the food.  The menu is similar, a few new changes and the prices are similar. One of the new additions are fresh juices like kale ginger and pear. I tried kale once, I don't want it in my juice.  The service has been consistently good. Our server was very nice and attentive. I like that they offer flavored coffee creamer at the table. Also, the coffee is great and they leave the carafe at your table so you don't have to wait for a top off.  I ordered biscuits and sausage gravy. Tasty and large portions (served with 2 eggs and taters). The gravy was a bit more like a creamy meat sauce. Think of the consistency of marinara meat sauce. Its mostly meat, in a sauce. The gravy was mostly meat, in a creamy pan gravy. No complaints, at all, but I was expecting a creamy gravy peppered with turkey sausage. Delicious, just different than what was in my head. Ended up taking half home for leftovers! The trusty S.O. got some kind of eggs, pancake and bacon. He cleaned his plate before I was done eating, which is rare for him! So it must have been great, for I heard nary a peep from him til he was done. Good job babe.  So, with the new name and menu came a few changes. Nothing too drastic and the prices are just about the same. They still have great service and big smiles. The coffee is still excellent (I always ask for a to-go cup, for the road). I'm glad the changes didn't kill the chill vibes. Great job, FW."}
{"text":"First Watch is one of those places that you won't mind waiting for a table because the food is THAT GOOD. It's one of my go-to places for breakfast and lunch because of the variety on the menu and of how reliably delicious it is. The wait isn't even that bad because they serve coffee just inside the door! (And it's some of my favorite coffee around too let me just mention)."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but portions are a bit small for the price. Friendly staff. VERY limited parking. We joined the waitlist via Yelp before driving over, and got a table as soon as we checked in...use this feature if you can! We were there pretty early on a Monday and it was already packed."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place.  The staff and service is outstanding. The food is amazing!! I've yet to have anything I didn't like - such great combinations of flavors and interesting twists on old favorites. And their coffee is the best! We've been coming here a couple times a month since they opened about a year ago. A favorite for our whole family."}
{"text":"The BEST customer service I've ever had! Every single employee I talked with was so kind and wanted to make sure I was taken care of. I came just a few minutes before closing to take out an order (which having been in the food industry before, it's usually super annoying when you're trying to close the place down) but they were SO nice and everybody treated me like a friend. I had the \"chikichanga\" which was absolutely delicious. Perfect portion size, and I felt great afterwards. Not the usual stuff-yourself-gross feeling, I felt good! Such a good and chill environment, very spacious with cute decor, and healthy food! A little more pricey than other chain places, but absolutely worth a little extra. (And I'm a cheapskate usually). I will definitely be coming more often. :)"}
{"text":"My family needed someplace for breakfast yesterday morning on our way to the airport and google maps indicated that First Watch was close and well-reviewed. We were a little nervous about finding a decent restaurant in that part of Phoenix (let's be honest - in just about any part of Phoenix), so we were tremendously pleased when we found this place. The atmosphere was good, the restaurant clean, the staff friendly and attentive, and the food was surprisingly healthy and delicious.  We all enjoyed our meals and they got us out in plenty of time to catch our flights. If I found myself near a First Watch again I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very health-conscious restaurant. There were quite a few combinations in foods/drinks that I was a bit skeptical about, but if you like kale or avocado, this is the place for you! Food was excellent and potatoes were seasoned perfectly! Very attentive staff! Parking was a bit difficult, but worth it. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were fans of First Watch when we lived in Kansas City so we were very excited to learn one was opening up near our home.  We tried it out today and it did not disappoint. The service was great, everyone was very friendly, and the restaurant itself is very cute. The food way very tasty and satisfying. We had the breakfast tacos and the avocado toast and they were both very flavorful. We were also able to try the new fresh juices they offer and they were delicious! Ice cold and fresh - perfect compliment to our meals.  We look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"First time here. Love the ambiance and food was super! I had Florentine eggs Benedict that was cooked perfectly! My husband had a ham and cheese omelet that was creamy light and he reported delicious! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the staff! Nate did a great job with managing a crazy-busy New Year's Eve crowd. Food is, as always, awesome... Keep up the phenomenal work!"}
{"text":"Update: Went back to First Watch after the bad experience and they redeemed themselves! Alex was super nice and super sweet!!! My veggie sandwich was delicious this time and was not burned...thank you!!"}
{"text":"This was the go-to place for our staff brunches. I've had almost half the menu here, and it's not bad. It's nothing that will knock your socks off, but it's an acceptable brunch place that can appease anyone in your party. I appreciate the healthy options that they have as well. My favorite hangover food is one of their skillets with poached eggs. It really doesn't get better than that. Add a cup of coffee and it's as if last night never happened.  Be warned though-the lines are insanely long. Be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes for brunch on Saturday and Sunday during peak hours.   Also, I agree with another reviewer. The home fries are always bland, and I have to load them with salt/pepper/salsa. Sometimes they're even dry/cold. Sadness."}
{"text":"Went to this place this morning after hearing about it on TV. Loved the decor very warm and inviting. Was greeted on walking in,  I  had my service dog with me and they made sure to seat me where she was comfortable also. Every thing very fresh. The coffee was so good we picked up a bag of grounds to brew at home. We will go back for breakfast and I am looking forword to trying the lunch one day. THIS IS A MUST GO TO FOR A HEATHLY MEAL."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at the First Watch. There were many healthy breakfast options to select. Our waitress was very friendly and service was smooth. I got the kale tonic juice for 4.99 and the tri-athlete omelet for 8.29 (came with pico de gallo). Overall, I had a great breakfast. Prices were affordable. The juice is actually refreshing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A nice place for breakfast,  love the avocado toast and green juice. The fresh squeezed  juice  is amazing!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I had lunch here today.  I normally go to the Crocker Park location for breakfast on the weekends, but since this one opened up right down the street from my office I suggested we give it a try.  My go-to item is their breakfast burrito (yum!) but I thought I would order one of their sandwiches for the first time today.  I got the Green Hamlet wrap; ham, Havarti, lettuce, tomatoes, green apple slices and honey dijon dressing.  I thought it was decent, but didn't blow me away.  My coworker on the other hand thought it was amazing.  To each their own.  But what really impressed me was how they went above and beyond in the service aspect after we left the restaurant.  As we were on the way back to the office, my cell phone rang with my boyfriend's number showing up.  I thought he was butt dialing me from the front seat so I answered with a laugh.  But it wasn't his butt calling me, it was actually the hostess from First Watch!  He had left his phone on the table and she remembered my name from the credit card receipt so she looked me up in his contacts to let us know.  Now some may think this was an invasion of privacy, but I saw it as an employee going the extra mile.  If she hadn't of called I guarantee we would have been back in the office parking lot before he realized it was missing and freaked out.  So kudos to her!"}
{"text":"Holy Moses! This place is so good! I liked this place so much the first time we went, I had to try it again before flying back home. DELICIOUS! The avocado toast is amazing and their power bowl is just as good. The portion sizes are great, I was filled up without feeling uncomfortable. Delectable fruit, good coffee and an unbelievable price for such great food. The employees were very friendly and sweet. Michael A is a sweetheart. :) Definitely try this place out! You won't be disappointed. While the climate in Arizona wasn't to my liking, I would visit again just to eat here."}
{"text":"First Watch is a local chain that serves up average breakfast food. This place isn't terrible, but it is also not remarkable in any way.  The booths are made of slotted wood, and for some reason they haven't been updated in years, resulting in sub-par seating that will leave horizontal lines on anyone wearing shorts.  The food is ok, not exciting or great, just ok. The coffee is bad, it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water. Additionally they don't have fresh half&half, they have the little individual cups similar to Circle K.  For this visit, the HUGE downfall was the service. I won't describe this person because I don't want any harm coming to her job, but if our server wasn't on meth, then I don't like cupcakes (HINT- I love cupcakes). The server was jittery, confused and racing around unnecessarily. Making things more annoying, the booth near us apparently had some of the servers friends dining, and they were so loud, I thought I was at a club. When we were seated the server yelled over to us asking us for a drink order. For the next ten minutes she sat with her pals and cackled about something they were watching on a smart phone.  It was sketchy too because they started talking pretty loudly about sex acts, and other things that aren't the best fit when there are tables of kids within five feet. I have a great sense of humor, but 11:00am on a Saturday isn't the best time to get cheeky at breakfast. In a different restaurant, they might politely ask the people who are yelling loudly and having inappropriate conversations to dial it down, but here the server was sitting with them, and was part of it.  Interestingly, all the other staff we encountered were very nice and appropriate, but our server was SO poor, that it just couldn't save the outing. Our food was brought to us by a lovely server who we wished would have been ours from the start. After our food was brought out, our server never stopped by again. It was funny however, that she had to walk by our table five times to go back and sit with her friends, and cackle some more- but couldn't stop to see if we needed more water (yes) Luckily my dining pal has a sense of humor and just rolled her eyes, but I would be livid if I brought my Mom, etc. there.  In closing, I cannot recommend this place for a meal. It's not terrible, but with the economy being so sketchy, it's nice to spend money somewhere that is comfortable and where you're not ignored, or served by someone who likely cannot pass a drug test."}
{"text":"So happy First Watch came to Mesa, AZ.  Love their breakfast and brunch-y menu.  I recommend the avocado toast to everyone. What I would like to see in the future: Gluten-free toast, a bottled spring water for the table and a few special coffee's - i.e. lattes. Other than that, I made this my go-to place! love it."}
{"text":"We have been to First Watch at 61 W. Thomas several times and have always enjoyed.  We decided to try the one on Central because of the large patio.  We were greeted by a friendly welcoming host and waited around 45 minutes for the table which was expected time-frame for a Sunday brunch.  By the time we ordered, we were hungry.  Husband had the Smoked Salmon Frittata and I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.   When the food came, It was cold.  Not just luke warm, but \"cold.\" They had no problem sending it back to make it again and the second time around, my eggs came back raw.  While waiting, we picked at Hubbie's Frittada which was very thin and served with one very small piece of toast and a tiny salad.  The food was less than mediocre and I have to say, we both left unsatisfied.  Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very clean and nice. Well lit and good clean cafe.  Menu is diverse  Taste was a bit on the disappointing side. This is a solid 3 star place, its been rated four stars. The menu execution drags it down.  Service was very good Atmosphere is very pleasant  Food-was kind of average or below average.  Its a diner in disguise, nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place has become our favorite local breakfast spot. Food has been great every time."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The best part about eating here is that it caters to all types of eaters, you get eat yummy healthy food or splurge a little. Either way you will be happy."}
{"text":"Was forced here again due to nothing in the area. The Belguim waffle was horrendous..one of the worst waffles ever, nothing like a real dense Belgium waffle.  Same miserable old waitress with no personality and screw this corporate bully chain. Bring back the old place. Nasty food here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best First Watch's in the valley! Always quick and friendly service. Usually order the chickichanga or the parma hash and it never disappoints! Some of the other locations do not cook it as good as this location. A go-to breakfast joint."}
{"text":"The service here is always great and it's one of the nicest locations, food is also really fast never a wait. we got the the chickichanga which is DELICIOUS as always. we also tried the barbacoa benedict which is a seasonal item. it was also very good. it the eggs were over-cooked and not runny how I like them. I would specify how you like your eggs when ordering the benedicts. other than that it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations in the valley and it's always a hit or miss. Some are decent, some are below par, then occasionally you get the rare gem where everything is just perfect!! I've eaten here on multiple occasions and their avocado toast is to die for. The chickichanga is also one of my favorites along with a lot of their other breakfast items. The food is always freshly prepared and delicious and their juices are freshly squeezed as well. it's packed on sundays so use their no wait app if you plan to come for brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"This place is pure awesomeness!! Today was my first visit and i am definitely adding it on my list for breakfast and lunch places. Very healthy menu options, wide variety of food, and very high food quality. Definitely the place to go to!!"}
{"text":"I love first watch i always go to the location on Ray rd because it is the closest to my house. This time i went to the one on Dobson because it is close to my work. How lucky to have one close enough to my work to be able to go during my lunch break. First watch never fails to amaze me! This place has a very wide offering of menu items and they are all good. I also love their chocolate mint they offer on our way out"}
{"text":"I love first watch this place has an amazing selection of food and is not just like the regular breakfast places where you can either eat eggs or pancakes. First watch has healthy options that are delicious and nutritious. Every time i go i can't wait for my next visit to try something different on the menu because they have so many things i want to try!!"}
{"text":"My servers name is Amanda. She was amazing anything we asked she brought it to us within 5 minutes. I wasn't sure which drink to order so she brought all 3 drinks so that I can try. We then ordered and got our order maybe 30 minutes max now that's fast! Loved the whole old look to it. will be going there more often."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love it (it's so close to our house!), but our experience wasn't great, especially compared to some really awesome breakfast joints around here. Our waitress greeted us kindly enough - this place feels like an Albuquerque Flying Start - a compliment. We ordered, only slightly veering from the \"as-is\" dish. Literally got one slightly different dish, one slightly more different dish, and one totally different one. Food was just ok. When we asked our barely there server, she TOLD us what we ordered. We were hardly comfortable sending it back, so we didn't. Not sure how she could know what we asked for since the service tab was not legible to any of us. The gentleman that settled our bill asked how our food was, but I gotta say...he didn't care. We will stick with our usual spot. :/ 3 stars for fresh fruit, clean bathroom and quick seating."}
{"text":"Omg. This place is a gem.  The waiter could not have been better if he tried.  Even gave me a cup of coffee for the road.  I asked him for a recommendation.  He basically said everything is great. I agree it was.  I got the avocado toast and suggest you get it as well.  I would gladly go there again"}
{"text":"Well... It wasn't as good as it appeared.. I ordered eggs over easy with the pumpkin pancake(I forgot what they called it on the menu). Pancake was crumbly and didn't hold together very well and the eggs had a surprising amount of oil on them. I also ordered a carrot, Apple ginger juice which I dare say.. The ingredients came out of a container(pre made??) and Im wondering if there was any ginger in it at all.. In short, it didn't seem like much care was put into the preparation and I guess the servers could care less about what they're serving.   Although the greeting upon entry was very welcoming, everything else was at best meh..  I recommend somewhere else.. And read these reviews.. They help.  That's where I went wrong."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast chains around. The coffee and water is great and plentiful. Today I got a ham and gruyere sandwich with added bacon, it was excellant, as well as potatoes which were succulently cooked with onions. VERY flavorful.  Only downside this visit was that my chocolate chip pancake was not hot, and the chocolate chips were few and sparsely applied."}
{"text":"We are big foodies and love trying new places, even if it means driving out of our way. We tried this place based on the reviews and were underwhelmed.  As individuals who work in the service industry, customer service is huge.  Our hostess was less than friendly and we waited quite a while to be greeted by our waitress.  It didn't bother us until other patrons seated after us were greeted by their waiter.  The restaurant was relatively empty so there was no excuse for this.  When she finally did greet us her demeanor was just ok.  Fine I'm not picky; but in a restaurant we want to at least feel \"liked\" by our server.  You have a good product, as the food was good (better than some in the area).  But some positive energy would do your establishment some good.  Highly doubt we'd be back as other competitors have the up on your customer service."}
{"text":"This place is just great! And across the street from my house #bonus    If anything, we need more parking spots!"}
{"text":"First watch is a great choice for breakfast and lunch!! I had a traditional meal this time dippy eggs, toast and potatoes and the portion are small which is good but they have so Many healthy options it's honestly great! Also you can sit outside as my friend and I did this morning and it was such a great lunch!! Our server was strange and perhaps he was nervous or maybe new but other than that fast service and great food! Highly recommend for someone that loves eatting on the healthier side or just wants a good meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Has a patio to enjoy the outdoors. Staff is always friendly. They offer free coffee and infused water while you wait. The menu is extensive with plenty of healthy options as well. Parking is easy. The only complaint is that the wait is sometimes really long, and food can take a long time, but thats because it's popular."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here traveling from Phoenix to Sedona and so glad we did. As others have stated the service and food is amazing. Both of us could not resist the avocado toast and it's truly the best breakfast ever. Topped it off with the Kale juice. So delish!"}
{"text":"DIRTY dishes! Unfortunately the glasses and silverware were VERY dirty both times I've been. Greasy fingerprints on the silverware doesn't make for an appetizing experience! Someone with dirty hands is handling the clean dishes. Otherwise the food is good and service is great, but dirty dishes can't be overlooked!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place east of Cleveland. Lot's of parking. Short waits. Friendly staff. Have a scrambler or the works. It's really good there."}
{"text":"Very good waffle. It's light and fluffy and worth a visit. We had simple breakfast of fried eggs and toast but it was fast and yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free french toast. Great service and the avocado toast was awesome. Really recommend for a healthy brunch option. Has juice i didn't try but there is a juice bar that looked great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the other low rating reviews have to do with people coming in on the wrong day or with the wrong crew? If that's happening I sure hope it gets corrected. I came here personally and LOVED it. The food was fantastic. The avocado toast was done up perfectly, the coffee was fresh and brewed to perfection. Sure we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated but it was pretty quick and there was a great ambiance to the place. I am definitely picky when I go out to eat and have never eaten at a first watch before, but this one impressed me and I can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"Super healthy breakfast foods.  Super tasty too. You can get all of the omelets with your choice of egg whites only, low cholesterol eggs, or just plain old chickeny eggs, free of charge! You can also choose from their specially titled \"healthy choices,\" but to me, everything seems pretty darn good!   After a night out about the town, this is definitely a place to go to resume your healthy side. Give your skin some nice moisture and boost up on Vitamin C by soaking up their freshly squeezed orange juice (only 3.39!). It is absolutely sweet and tangy. You can also cure any hangovers with their delicious Sunrise coffee...a whole pot of it if it pleases you for just a few dollars.   I got the Florentine eggs benedict and blueberry pancakes and oh man....SOOO flipping delicious. I didn't think I would be a huge fan of multigrain pancakes because sometimes things taste just TOO healthy. I want to be healthy, but eat food that makes me feel good. These pancakes, smoothered with the delicious blueberry sauce, fits the bill. Just a warning though, they make you pay for the syrup separately ($1.29) if you want the good maple syrup.   The waitress was super friendly and the service was quick. You have to wait a little because the tiny place is PACKED. But its not a bad wait and there's always the shops around if you need to run a few errands before sitting down for a nice breakfast!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about this place we had to try it out. We went in for a late breakfast at 1:30 hoping they wouldn't be busy and luckily they weren't. Less than half the restaurant was occupied however, it took someone 5 minutes to seat us. Our waitress looked disheveled with stains all over her shirt and wasn't very pleasant. After being seated it took her about 15 minutes to take our food order. She apologized for it taking so long. Our food took about a half hour to come out and at this point the restaurant was closing soon. The portion sizes were very small. They claim their pancakes are huge but they weren't anything impressive. Our waitress dropped the check and said they were closing soon. We felt very rushed. Overall there are MUCH better places to eat breakfast in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love first watch - but a restaurant of this level should have at least one gluten free breakfast or lunch option - i.e. bread for sandwiches, or a pancake or french toast options."}
{"text":"First time in on Sunday. Looked for reviews first and was given the option to let the restaurant know I was on the way! Coooool! Checked in when I got there and all along was able to follow the status of where I was in line for a table up until I was seated using yelp. Also got texts along the way!  Had a nice hostess and server. Iced coffee with cream and sugar was delicious! I had an omelette can't remember the name but it came with eggs cheese ham bacon tomato and mushrooms which I subbed for spinach. Added breakfast potatoes. Tried the $5 bacon. Pic attached. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast and lunch place for healthy food and we can't live without the kale tonics!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I love their healthy options! Feel like you get good quality food for what you pay and good portions. Never had issues with the service there. The only downside is it's usually crowded and sometimes parking is hard to find depending on when you go. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed breakfast at First Watch they are formerly the Good Egg. The food is consistently good hot and fresh lots of great choices. There is usually a pretty long wait and the waiting area is somewhat cramped with people trying to check in and also paying there tickets after meal all in the same area there can sometimes be lines and some congestion. There is not a lot of seating, that area should really open up more, but the food is worth it. The service can be inconsistent depending on how crowded they are, but everyone is usually very friendly. The décor is a modern farmhouse look, nicely done."}
{"text":"I really like First Watch. I like the avocado toast which seems to have an entire avocado on it, I am not complaining at all! Order a side of bacon and you are good to go. The fresh juices, especially the Morning Meditation which has orange juice, lemon, turmeric and ginger topped with beet juice mixed with agave and it is dang tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to go! Amazing service, wonderful group of people, and great food!! Highly recommend giving it a shot"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the best service in AZ so far. I'm new to AZ and I had not been wowed until I tried Avocado Toast... Damn delicious!  I've been there four times and I have yet to try anything else but I do love how friendly the service is and it's a super cute restaurant to boot."}
{"text":"We came here twice for breakfast on our three day vacation it was so good!  Had we noticed it earlier, it might have been 3 days in a row. From the basic coffee to the meal, they're food is so good and they take their time to ensure the presentation is great as well!"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! The place was packed and we still were seated immediately. Our waitress was so sweet and very quick with everything.   The food was also delicious. Many options on the menu and so much flavor in each dish that we ordered. I had the Floridian French toast- Amazing! My daughter had a chocolate chip pancake which was also amazing! Very fluffy and it came with bacon. I ordered sausage links as extra and I liked them but my brother and father didn't. My father liked the sausage patties better. The link was much softer. Bacon was perfect. Brother had biscuits and gravy, and usually I don't care for that dish but his were yummy.   Overall, excellent."}
{"text":"Did they spend all of the money on the new building and forget how to make breakfast?   For a \"high end\" breakfast joint this place falls very  short: 1) Omelette was offered with egg whites (for no extra charge, awesome!) but came out at room temperature.  2) My friend had to send back his food twice, it was wrong even the second time... not the level of service that was expected... 3) Potatoes were dry, also were about room temperature.   Honestly, I think this place focuses on cutesy decorating rather than a good breakfast. I got an average/ below average breakfast and paid top dollar. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"First Watch is like brunch to training wheels on me. It's good the first couple times for a pretty consistant, filling breakfast. BUT then you find another place that slowly knocks it down your breakfast list. That my friends is what happened to me and First Watch.   About 2 years ago, I'd visit often. The service was good, the food quick and fresh and the prices were right. But it lacked something. It took me awhile to figure it out and once I started visiting the local mom and pop brunch spots, I know. My dates with First Watch were dwindling.  Now, it;s not to say First Watch isn't good because it is. if you're looking for a typical breakfast menu with some odd variations, this might be your place.   TIP: Crowded on the weekend! They don't take reservations but if you call, they will put your name on the waiting list."}
{"text":"decent sit down breakfast.  average but in agrees with the price.  my mushroom and cheese omelet was just ok and the potatoes were a little salty and dry.  but everybody else's food looked great, like the skillets and pancakes!  their coffee is impressively strong and the pot stays on your table, definitely a plus and service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Came with a large group for a work event. I feel like these massive groups typically lead to a decline in service and food quality due to the influx of orders, but that was not the case for our party of 15+ here at First Watch!   Our group debated the old name of this chain (we landed on The Good Egg). The staff were efficient, friendly, and on pointe. All of our orders came out correct and delicious! I split an order of \"millionaire's bacon\" with a few colleagues and secretly wished I didn't have to share that candied bacon goodness.   My brunch choice was a soup and sandwich combo, opting for the seasonal squash soup. I would order this again, but my friends' breakfast plates made me jealous so I will probably get a waffle or omelet next time.   Definitely a trustworthy option for real food, great service, and outstanding bacon."}
{"text":"It was like having sex, but without all of the tears afterwards. The bacon was next level good!everyone is nice! Saw someone I knew, so that was awkward. So yeah, 10/10 would definitely eat my problems away there again."}
{"text":"On vacation in Phoenix.  Had breakfast here this afternoon.  We ordered the Frittata Rustica, an order of the millionaire's bacon and the Tri-Fecta.  The service was excellent, attentive and very personable & friendly.   The food was also excellent and definitely will return tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great food. I go here frequently and have never had one issue! Love it and recommend them to all my friends for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"We've never been to this location, and overall, it was fine. They were busy at 11:00 on a Sunday, but we got seated within 10 minutes, just as they had predicted. Service was fine, but not stellar. The coffee was a tad harsh, and I had to ask for water.    Our breakfasts were OK: I had the Trifecta, the idea of which I wish I would see more often on menus. It was a Belgian waffle, 2 eggs, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage. My bacon was pretty over-done, and my over-easy eggs were slightly under-done. Think of me what you will for the next comment, but the cooks at Cracker Barrel *always* get the eggs and bacon right. The waffle was neither the best nor the worst I have ever had. Hubby had the bacon and avocado omelette, which he liked well enough. He was glad for the salsa, which he said made the dull potatoes more palatable.  I don't think we'd ever make this First Watch a destination breakfast, but if we find ourselves hungry at the Promenade again, we might give it another chance."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the veggie burger but they said they couldn't make it without mushrooms. They claim everything is made there from scratch but that obviously isn't the case. The waiter said the veggie burgers are premade and that there was no way to make one without mushrooms. I guess false advertising is the way this restaurant gets it's name out there. I got three pumpkin spice pancakes with butter and whip cream. They only put enough butter on top for one pancake. I asked for more butter and didn't get it until my pancakes were cold. I had to ask twice for the butter since it turned out the waiter forgot I even asked him for it. He brought an even tinier version of butter so I decided to just stop asking for more stuff cause it seemed like it was just making my experience here worse everytime I asked for something else. The pancakes were okay. They tasted good but but the 2nd and 3rd pancakes were just too cold to enjoy. I don't think I'll be coming back. Hopefully they'll have better service here in the future for the sake of others."}
{"text":"Average chain breakfast at best. Nothing new or interesting on the menu that isn't found at hundreds of other places.  Sprinkling herbs on the food doesn't make up for average ingredients in the mix."}
{"text":"This is near my downtown condo, which is convenient since I can eat here multiple times a week without tiring of it.  Free newspapers, great service and friendly staff who remembers their \"regular\" customers, breakfast all day and huge glasses of iced tea - adds up to a very enjoyable, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Trust me, I am usually very positive on my reviews, as you may have seen in the past, but this really bothered me. We came here for our first time on Sunday, June 3rd for brunch, after church.  Our waitress was great but I was very disappointed in my food. To start, the food portions were small, my 2 scrambled eggs were about the size of 2 teaspoons full, I got 1 regular sausage link and 1 multigrain pancake. (sausage and pancake was delicious!) But how can they mess up 2 regular scrambled eggs? First time my plate was brought out, looked like it was a soft cooked egg that was smashed up in a pan, bright yellow and white with bright green seasoning on top! I took a bite, even though it surely didn't look like any scrambled egg I've ever had and was shocked when I bit into eggshells! I asked waitress politely for another one; no problem. The second time, instead of regular scrambled eggs, usually an even light yellow color, it came back looking the exact same as the one I returned, only it was fresh off the grill. Again, it was bright yellow, white and the bright green seasoning on it. It was another 2 soft fried eggs that was broken up to \"appear\" as it was scrambled! I was quite disappointed as I was excited to try out a new place to eat in Matthews. The atmosphere was great, the waitress was great but $10 for this?"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The staff took care of our softball team of 15 with no problem. The food was delicious. We had the pancakes and hash with eggs and toast."}
{"text":"Called in an order for pickup on a busy Sunday morning. All food was prepared as ordered and was ready in 20 minutes. Food was still hot when I picked it up and tasted great when I got it home. The chickichanga is awesome as is the waffle a la carte!"}
{"text":"We frequented this restaurant prior to its conversion to First Watch and it was always  good. This is our second visit to this First Watch this summer and it will be our last. Both times we waited inordinately long time for our meals (both times the restaurant was barely busy) and both times our food was barely warm or two of four meals were cold. This AM my wife's french toast arrived warm to the touch (the syrup was hotter than the french toast) but each bite was cold when she began eating it. She did not feel anything would be gained by sending it back. My waffle was barely warm when it arrived but was cold by the time I finished it. Even worse, the sausage link that accompanied the waffle from the first bite was cold in the middle. I'm sure had the food been warmer or even HOT it would have been delicious. It appears the kitchen crew either cannot coordinate an order with different prep times so everything is ready at once and hot off the grill, or the holding spot for prepared food lacks sufficient heat to keep the orders ready or the wait staff is negligent in collecting their orders. If any one of these people fail to do their job adequately the customer is the one who gets a lukewarm verging on cold breakfast. Our score - two visits - four cold meals. While our review only applies to this location we have been to other First Watch (Formerly The Egg & I) and they were acceptable but after this visit it is doubtful we will visit any First Watch in the future."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here twice in a week with my coworkers. Because it was a holiday week, there wasn't any wait for a table both times. I have walked by during lunch where there is a pretty decent wait, so keep that in mind if you are on a time crunch. The first visit I had their \"traditional\" with scrambled eggs, bacon, seasoned potatoes extra crispy, and an english muffin. When the food arrived, it came with toast by mistake, but the server immediately brought out the english muffin, so no issue there. The staff has always been courteous and friendly. The eggs were good, light and fluffy, the bacon was nice and crispy, and the english muffin was what you would expect in an english muffin and came pre-buttered, so if you order one and don't want butter make sure to ask ahead of time. The potatoes were not super extra crispy, but again, that seems to be the case with most places. Even only slightly crispy, the potatoes were tasty. Overall I have had good consistent meals at this location since it opened.  The second lunch I had the elevated egg sandwich. This is a simple goto sandwich I have had before. They were accommodating of my changes, which was no mayo, and for the egg to be over hard instead of over easy. This time the potatoes were extra crispy and were still delicious. A simple lunch that hit the spot before a long holiday weekend. The only real issue with First Watch is that it is pretty expensive for what you get, but it is still a nice treat for a lunch every now and again."}
{"text":"Delish breakfast! Here from out of town and was so pleased with our decision to eat here! Cute, clean and friendly staff! Food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to standard breakfast chains, in that it has healthier choices.  I ordered the avocado toast, & it was delicious.  Crushed avocado mixed with a little salt & olive oil is served almost an inch thick on very good whole grain/seed bread.  Two eggs come with it as well.  The eggs served are \"cage-free\" however that doesn't tell us much since \"cage free\" can mean that a chicken has a few minutes outside a day. The fact that this chain is trying to do better counts. They serve several fresh made juice/veg drinks too.  Many dishes are served along side of  fresh salad greens.  The service wasn't the best, and my over easy eggs came with totally hard yolks, but this First Watch is a new location, so hopefully that will improve.  There is self-serve coffee available while waiting, since often there is a wait."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this a.m. because all the other breakfast places had lines.  We used to like the menu when First Watch started in business.  We were less than impressed as the company has grown.  Sliced ham on the Eggs Benedict vs Canadian bacon was a change that we didn't like....more salty than Canadian Bacon.  The Coffee was not great coffee.  Of all places to have good coffee should be at a breakfast place!  And last of all, service was mediocre.  Server was busy flitting all around but not near our table so that we could remind him of the coffee order we placed 10 minutes prior!  Chances are, we won't rush back. Change is good when it's positive!"}
{"text":"First watch is our go to breakfast place for many reasons.   First, the food is always amazing. Just amazing. Tasty.  In addition to having your traditions non healthy options, they have plenty of healthy options that you don't find at other places.   Second, the service is always fantastic.   Third, the setting is very relaxing, tastefully designed, and reminds both my husband and I of fabulous village style cafes from La Jolla ca.   Fourth, this location is generally a ton less busy than the other locations such as the promenade location.   I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for lunch, it came highly recommend. Our waiter was THE BEST! I'm just sorry I didn't get his name. I ordered the eggs Benedict (it's my favorite). I was a little disappointed. The sauce was a bit too lemony.   My friend got the avocado toast and loved it.   They have a kale tonic drink that is amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food, our waiter, Kyle, was awesome. Country, but a little more upscale.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I did not like it at all...just kidding  Every time we come here, we are pleasantly surprised with the new items on the menu and the quality of the food & service. We love this place! (not kidding this time)."}
{"text":"Great healthy options. Really easy to put yourself on the wait list via yelp before you go over there."}
{"text":"Good news.... The food seemed better than when it was The Good Egg! Bad news.... Dirty silverware & glass, so we set those on the dirty tables around us. They ONLY clean a table when it is needed for customers. Otherwise the tables sit dirty. Weird idea... & gross to sit among!"}
{"text":"This was one of the few places open for breakfast/brunch near us when we were in North PHX a few weekends ago. The food overall was very fresh. I ordered a green juice (can't remember everything that was in it), it tasted good but there was so much ice in the drink that I had to scoop most of it out to truly enjoy the drink. I ordered french toast + eggs. Good flavor but not life changing. The eggs were good as well. I enjoyed the service/experience, but I would have to come back to try other items on the menu before making a final judgement."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible services. Ever single staff member had an attitude. We had to get up and go ask for silverware, glasses, and syrup.  The glasses were dirty with lipstick marks. All four meals came out cold. When asked to speak to the manager, he never came. They sent someone else about 5-10 minutes later.  Never cleared our plates. Go somewhere else. Very disappointed that we don't have a good breakfast place near us now."}
{"text":"Despite the less than stellar reviews, we tried this place because there simply aren't a lot of restaurant options in our area.   I was pleasantly surprised!    Loved the daily house-made tonics and my breakfast was delicious.  Service was good too!  I like this much more than The Good Egg (which I find to be mediocre at best)."}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta pancakes with strawberries was so delicious and lemony! Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"First visit to First Watch was most enjoyable. The most frustrating part of breakfast was deciding what to choose from the menu!  Everything chosen by our party of nine was excellent. From  omelettes, to pancakes to \"sunny side up\" eggs, all were prepared to perfection. Fresh fruit was served with each meal. One in our party raved over the Baconator omelette as the best ever eaten. Would recommend First Watch to all of our friends."}
{"text":"Sunday morning the wait was 1 hour but it was worth it.  Great coffee and everything was super fresh!  Our girls are very picky and liked the grilled cheese and kids pancake.  Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the low ratings about First Watch.  We have been here dozens of times and the food and service have always been top notch.  It is consistently great.  I will continue to support this great breakfast and lunch spot.  Special recognition to the servers-everyone is so friendly, positive and laid back."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE First Watch since there is one next to both my house and my work. Today I ordered to-go for my birthday breakfast...lemon ricotta pancakes with a few containers of syrup on the side and the biscuits and turkey gravy with two eggs over easy. Not only did it take 30 minutes for it to be made, but my entire order was wrong. I was given 3 containers of peanut butter instead if syrup...and just eggs with a dry biscuit....no gravy at all! Very upset and I would have gone all the way back but I was too hungry. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We just finished eating here and it was the best experience we have had for a restraunt. I had the BLTE with there soup of the day and it was fantastic. My husband had chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The bacon tasted great it did not have that rubber taste that most places do. We both had the seasoned potatoes that we loved. Our waitress was friendly and courteous. She was on top of our drinks and always asked if we needed anything.  The one slight complaint was the crackers for the soup tasted old."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I will round up.   While waiting, they have a bar in the front where you can get a cup of water or coffee (+ different flavor creamer). That's a nice addition to have since breakfast/brunch restaurants usually have long wait times. The front of the restaurant had chairs and seating for customers waiting, however their register is in the middle of the room so it's a little bit of awkward spacing when there are a lot of waiting parties.   The food took almost as long as the wait time to be seated which is about half an hour - give or take. I was in the mood for a pancake and the carrot cake caught my eye. It was my mistake because I didn't expect there to be so many raisins (which I found overpowering), however, I brought it home and my brother loved it. Up to preference: if you love or don't mind raisins or walnuts, carrot cake is the way to go!   I also ordered the million dollar bacon - good but I've had better, and the roasted potatoes - again, up to preference it'd like them a little more roasted as they were mushy like a baked potato consistency.   My boyfriend ordered the Triathlete, which is an egg white omelette with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and green chili and he really enjoyed it.   All in all, First Watch seems to be a nice place for brunch and I would come back to try other entrees on their menu."}
{"text":"This is new to Macedonia, and my friends had gone to some of the other locations and told me I had to go. The place is way bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside. It is very cute, the service was great, the food was tasty, and the coffee was good. I will be going again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for brunch! Today I had the heirloom tomato and Burrata toast. It was amazing! Eggs are served basted topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and herbs. My son loves his brioche French toast. Our server today was Stacy and she's always great  I have to say I wish last year's seasonal  salmon cucumber toast came back :-)"}
{"text":"Rodrigo was amazing!! Went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our breakfast. Great food. Great service. We will be back for sure. Next on the agenda is to call corporate to let them what a Rockstar they have in Rodrigo!"}
{"text":"Hey...I kinda really liked this breakfast joint. Nice selection to fill you bell hole. And good service. What else can u ask for at 8am in the morning and it's 90 deg. Outside. ..( maybe an igloo and a klondike bar??)  Peace"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast here. Since my wife is a Vegetarian, breakfast places can be challenging, finding things that are different to eat is tough. It can't always be fruit, eggs and cheese!  The menu here was awesome! Plenty of Vegetarian friendly options! After reviewing the menu, as of this writing, it looks like they are going for low fat, no grease, and limited red meat dishes. They also have enough options for meat eaters too.  My wife had the Vegetarian omelette which came with a green salad and homemade, multi-grain artisan toast. She really enjoyed the omelette.  I had the turkey sausage biscuits and gravy with two eggs. The turkey sausage biscuits and gravy tasted good, but I wish they would've had more gravy and turkey sausage - it was barely enough to cover the biscuits. I should've said something at the time but I was lazy. When the waiter asked how things were, I did mention it.  The restaurant is clean, bright, well decorated and the people were extremely helpful and friendly. The prices and portions were decent.  I will return, and would recommend this establishment to family and friends.  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast before court and have no complaints. The service was friendly, efficient and good-natured. The food was tasty and priced well. They are definitely geared toward a younger, health conscious patron offering various health drinks etc.  I would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Love the fresh look and the food is out of this world. Been there twice in the last week with my parents. Would have rated 5but the help needs to refresh their service skills. Very delayed for refills and I felt it was a bother to them that we were there to eat. Hopefully just a bad week and it's better next time."}
{"text":"First Watch is my first review of the year! My husband raved about this breakfast place. He went on and on about the skillets. During this summer on a weekend, we tried getting brunch there, but sadly, it was too crowded. We walked away, literally to the Outback next door. Today, we succeeded. We arrived at 8:30 am and was pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately. We ordered two Skillet Hash (Parma). We split it among four people.   My skillet was perfect. The eggs over hard was cooked perfectly without being too dry. The highlight was the golden brown, sauteed Crimini mushrooms. I also liked the buttered multi-grain toasts that came with delicious strawberry preserves. My husband's skillet wasn't as nicely presents. His skillet potatoes were underdone, a couple of my potatoes were also underdone. His eggs over easy was a little too runny for him. We enjoyed our little cup of fresh fruit that came with the meal.  For the price of $10.99, I enjoyed the spread, and the portions were more than generous. We did not leave hungry. I hope to be back again. By the time our meal was done, there was a line waiting to be seated. It was an auspicious beginning to the new year!"}
{"text":"I ordered their traditional Eggs Benedict.  The meal was very disappointing.  The chibatta bread was very tough.  The holandaise sauce was watery and was probably made from an instant.  The processed ham was not of high standard.  The potatoes were bland and under cooked,  The meal was served on a plate that barely fit the meal.  The plate was so small that trying to cut the food caused spillage on to the table surface.  I recommend that you try some place else for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time there. Waitress was very nice.  However, the food was mediocre, the presentation was not good, my eggs looked like they had been run over by a truck, and one of the orders was wrong so we had to wait for him to get his correct order, long wait.  We had finished eating by the time his order arrived. We even had to ask who I believe was the floor manager to check on the order. The sausage was tasteless. Was really hoping this was going to be great, but no such luck. Sorry.  Everyone was very gracious and wanted to please."}
{"text":"First time coming in this morning! Definitely will come back! Rustic, earthy, bistro type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our family has visited this site & the 1 in the Scottsdale Promenade. Each is unique, style wise; the Tempe location has a community table & really big booths & sadly needs more parking (we all had to park across the street in another lot but, it's ok. Needed to walk a little aft eating). The Scottsdale site is located in a shopping center, so parking is not an issue but the booths are smaller,  needing 2 tables together to fit the 8 of us. Service is excellent at both & the food delicious.  The bacon is so good, I literally have to fight off my grandchildren to keep them from stealing mine. Our daughter loves the Avocado Toast!  There's something for everyone,  from the cage free eggs to the  healthy menu to the vegetarian to the traditional bacon & eggs with toast. The jelly is made in house & delicious.  A bit more pricey than the chain restaurants but, definitely worth it."}

{"text":"Omelette was good. Potatoes were good. Sandwich was like something that you could make at home. The side salad was just leaves and no dressing. Asked for regular mustard and they don't have it.  Asked for salad dressing and there's only 1 kind. Service was good and staff was polite.  I get the whole sources from local growers approach, and using natural and organic ingredients. We came in from out of town and based on the pictures thought it would be like a normal breakfast cafe. If you're looking for more of the American/ comfort food/ hearty breakfast, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Only went here once for breakfast but the food was actually very good! Very good eggs and potatoes. I wasn't the biggest fan of their multigrain toast but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vegas. I had the BLTE and that was great! The new morning meditation was good as well. My gf had the AM Superfood Bowl and that was just phenomenal! We really need this place in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Food is great and so are the servers. Woman at the front with white hair extremely rude. My wife and I stood at the front for at least 2 minutes and she just stared to the left and would not acknowledge us. Not sure if she was having an absence seizure or just hated her job. Saw her do it to others as well. She is your first point of contact, should not happen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I just found this place and will surely be coming back!  I had the Benedict florentine and it was just how I like it. Interesting twist putting it on a ciabatta instead of English muffin. Was delicious!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about it I would say was the hostess when she greeted me as soon as I came through the door but the food was not up to par I ordered French toast a lot of spots in the French toast was still wet so I left over half of it on my plate I asked for over medium well eggs I got over easy extremely runny I was so upset I couldn't finish my chocolate milk, that I ordered and paid $15 still the cashier asked me how it was I told him it was not good and he still charged me I had no compensation I will not return to that restaurant...  the same Hostess did notice I was in a time crunch since I am a driver she tried to offer me something different but I had to leave it was too late kudos to the hostess she was extremely nice but I still will not return just because the food was not up to par and the cashier, he didn't even smile and he was no help....  : (...."}
{"text":"My first impression of first watch was how open and vivacious the space it. The staff are attentive and give great customer service, which I'm a stickler of. The wait times was none on a Saturday around noon! The food was affordable and very quick. I'm not taking away from the quality considering those qualities. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to enjoy great brunch food. They are accommodating to all ages and have a diverse menu catering to everyone's appetites. If your average spots are postino, snooze am, or something along those lines then you'll really love this place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast place when we have breakfast w/Mom. They have many choices to choose from (lots of healthy alternatives). Great tasting food, antentive servers, nice atmosphere (outside seating available for when weather permits) and many locations through out the valley to choose from. Come check it out for yourself !"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast this morning. I ordered smoked salmon & roasted vegetable frittata & morning meditation to drink. Food was good and served quickly. I have been to several different locations and have not had any problems at any of them. I enjoy their healthier menu options and recommend you STOP by and give them a try."}
{"text":"9/25/16: This was our first time to this location. Positives: 1. Seated within 10mins of waiting. 2. Great service from waiter.   It took 20-30 minutes to get our food after ordering and food came out cold.   The cashier took care of the bill, which  was a positive as that was not was I was going for just wanted to voice my concerns so management could improve. Thank You!  I know this location just opened so willing to go back in a few months to give them another try."}
{"text":"Food is really great but the service and kitchen are slooooow. I've been twice and both times we waited at least 20 minutes for our food. If you are going to have a huge restaurant you need a well staffed kitchen and enough waitstaff! Check it out but just make sure you don't have any immediate plans after."}
{"text":"Great healthy choices and that's about it.  The wait is forever no matter what yelp says.  They have their own app too which doesn't help or save any time waiting.  Had to clean my own greasy chair off after waiting 60 minutes.  Lesson?  Get the takeout IF you must eat here ... or just cook your own undercooked eggs to get a similar effect.  #notworththewaitever"}
{"text":"Overcooked and overpriced and over easy eggs were fried solid. Pancakes were dry as sawdust. Breakfast chicken sausage was tasty but plain home fries nothing special. To top it off a glass of milk was $3.29! Stick to Stacks for better food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Quick service, great food always fresh. Highly recommend.  My favorite is the potato dishes and their avocado toast is delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in this weekend to try out First Watch and found the beautiful place to be friendly and a very interesting menu. I had to try the fresh juices and just loved them! I also experimented with the smoked salmon frittata and was amazed at how good this was. I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Tasty and healthy-ish.  I had an egg white omelette and my son had blueberry-lemon pancakes.  Coffee was served in a generous carafe at the table.  Water was cool and also served in a carafe at the table.  Service was good, perhaps due to the lightly-attended 7:30  AM on a Friday time that we picked to eat."}
{"text":"One of our local favorite breakfast places. Everything on the menu is delicious. They have a Nutella French toast on special right now, definitely try! Kids menu is only under $6, and decent portions. They've recently remodeled and inside looks great. Friendly and great service and there is outdoor patio seating. Come early, it fills up."}
{"text":"Ample seating and great food options. Accommodating for children with kids menu, high chairs, and crayons. Easy parking and ok waiting area. Expect a small wait in the mornings. This place takes breakfast/brunch with a healthier twist. Highly recommend the Floridian French toast."}
{"text":"I really liked this place when it was good egg. The menu was classic and they use to bring out Cheerios and banana slices for my daughter complementary while we waited for our food. While its upgrade and the inside looks nice, they've changed menu and don't offer comp snack for kids. Slightly disappointed in the eggs Benedict since it's changed to a more healthier type. But the service has remained good as it was before."}
{"text":"So I haven't been here in a few years, but I met a friend for brunch. They have remodeled the inside and it looks nice - kinda rustic. We were seated quickly, and coffee and water was brought right away. The coffee is ok, nothing special. Individual pots are brought to each table, and while that's a good idea, our coffee pot had a giant greasy handprint on it so I was leery of how often they are cleaned. We ordered and food was quickly delivered. I got the BLT eggs Benedict and my friend had the veggie omelette. Both were good and filling, and included greens on the side. A nice breakfast all in all, minus the dirty coffee pot. Go early on weekends to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. The decor and atmosphere are very nice. Pancakes were very good and the Chickichanga was spicy and also very good.  We had a small issue with our order and but as the manager came over, unsolicited, just to check on us and once he was told he quickly and professionally took care of the issue. I wish more managers showed they cared about customers as much as this one. Will definately return for the good atmosphere, food, and courteous management."}
{"text":"Great restaurant layout, very clean.  Friendly staff and very good service with recommendations on menu were on point. Lots of heathy options. Portions are perfect, not too big not too petite. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Initially, the restaurant has a very hipster/country vibe. Their interior is made up of metal and locally recycled wood.   Their menu is very extensive. I only browsed the breakfast menu but they have everything from simple to things you wouldn't think of putting together.   I opted for one of the eggs Benedict. It's was great but the meat on it was more overpowering than the hollandaise sauce.   The girlfriend has avocado toast and it was amazing. It came with huge chunks of avacado and was seasoned perfectly on thick break.   This is a great addition to Toledo."}
{"text":"Chickichanga.  Get it.   Good service, but this place is usually packed!  So plan on waiting a 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!  I had Floridian Pancakes, and they were like heaven. The kale tonic is so legit. This place is on point."}
{"text":"The food was above mediocre... ok, maybe more than that. It was decent... the service was slow, and the cost isn't worth \"decent\" tasting food. I was not impressed after hearing how amazing and delicious this place is."}
{"text":"Tried them twice, they can't cook an egg to save a life. Wait time is always long, food came out cold.  Bummer too because it's so close to home and really the only breakfast place close by.  I really wanted them to be better."}
{"text":"Best coffee around even my husband who hates coffee enjoys it! Try the avocado toast so yum but we've never had a bad meal there"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that the website and menu really sold us, my party determined that this restaurant was pretty much like Ihop. Nothing that we ordered particularly stood out to us. Plus, we felt really uncomfortable in the environment. It wasn't the warm and inviting ambiance that we were expecting. The waitress was very understanding that I did not like my strawberry lemonade (too sweet) and promptly removed it but she still charged me for it. Overall, I was not impressed and probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place in Matthews! I had a delicious omelet and last time I had the eggs Benedict. Both were fantastic! Can't wait to go back again!  I ate half of my omelet before I remembered a photo! Sorry it was so good! ?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great place for brunch.   GET THE AM SUPERFOOD BOWL. It has coconut pudding chia, fruit, granola, and preserves. It is so so amazing and a great dish to share as a starter.   I also recommend the avocado toast (great bread) and the chicken pesto power protein bowl. It comes with chicken, roasted tomatoes, quinoa, kale, and some herbs on top. Super good for lunch!   Cold brew is also 10/10.   Much love for first watch."}
{"text":"Lovely place to come, I can even have breakfast at lunch hours!! So perfect. My morning sunrise drink really makes me smile. I know I'm drinking something so nornishing."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Avoid this place at all cost. Sat there while tables seated after me were served their food first. Server was a blonde girl, never got her name because she didn't introduce herself or offer any courtesy.  After waiting 40 minutes for my food I got a rubbery previously frozen turkey burger, without the avocado I asked for on the side, and the blandest white clam chowder I've ever had.   I ate a quarter of my burger and the same amount of soup.   My girlfriend's plate of potatoes, bacon, and eggs came out cold.. How can you mess that up at a breakfast spot? The plate must have been sitting in the window for a while.   No one asked us how the food tasted, if we wanted to go boxes or anything. It was not busy (Thursday  12:30pm 01/04/18)  Instead, the waitress swiped my card for thirty dollars and dropped the check without asking us how it was, have a nice day, thank you, or anything.    Overpriced. Seriously.. this is not how you do business. Whoever was managing on 01/04/18 needs to be trained. No teamwork, no service. You will waste your money if you go here."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say!!!! I had one of the best meals ever here! I had the vegetable sandwich on grain bread. The taste was fab!!!!! The line was long but moved along pretty quickly. It was worth the wait!  I have not tried the breakfast items but what I saw on other plates was impressive! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I try to eat locally whenever possible but sometimes you just need a sure thing.  First Watch never disappoints.  The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with marinated berries and lemon curd were exactly what I wanted.  That and a smooth cup of rich coffee that was never empty.  Great service as usual."}
{"text":"The food was good, enjoyed the new menu. However, the new manager (an older man), was very grumpy and didn't seem to care about his customers or wait staff. He was very brusk and rude when seating us. He was equally cranky to the poor server when we were seated! Wasn't impressed with his lack of professional behavior!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and the food was EXCELLENT! I had a half sandwich (club) with a half salad (chicken and avocado) Highly recommend! Good service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious and great portions. Obviously very fresh even when we showed up at 130pm. Waitress was sweet and the outdoor seating was clean and comfortable. Now we're all happily stuffed and can't wait to come back soon!  Biscuits in biscuits and gravy were big and fluffy  Crepes were stuffed full of fresh fruit and the granola aide was delicious. It also came with a fresh muffin of the day. I got poppy seed and started feeding the cute birds around me with it til I realized it was too good to not eat myself! Bacon portions were great...4 large crispy pieces and the home fries were plentiful and fresh with a perfect amount of onion.  Side salad looked and tasted wonderful and the benedicts are fresh looking and wonderful and not too difficult to cut into their wonderful English muffins.  Sandwiches are a great size and delicious.   I'm going to be thinking about this breakfast all day!!"}
{"text":"Brunch with Brooke:   Pulling up to first watch it was moderately busy but they got us seated fairly fast. Options were inside out side or first available. Looking into the menu everything was $10 a plate I got a egg sammy with avocado, bacon x potatoes on the side a iced coffee. Brooke got biscuits with turkey sausage, gravy with eggs x potatoes on the side a coke. WITH a muffin of the day (blueberry). No complaints everything was delicious. Atmosphere was great we sat outside and enjoyed people watching. Bathrooms had a good vibe very clean with up beat but calm music. 3 days later we got the check."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is consistently delicious. The staff is super friendly.  You can tell they have great team work and they genuinely like their job.  It's great being in that atmosphere I will always go to this First Watch even if it's a little more of a drive."}
{"text":"best toast I have ever tasted in my life, the sausage links are so juicy, and the potatoes are crispy and evenly cooked, I have yet to finish my food but wow I'm amazed at how awesome the food tastes!!!! I recommend \"The Traditional Breakfast.\" The place itself is aesthetically pleasing and super relaxed place to eat, if I could give it 10 stars i would"}
{"text":"Most excellent food. Vegan & vegetarian choices.  Seasonal specials are the bomb!  Kids love the skillet potatoes, cinnamon bun waffles, veggie burgers"}
{"text":"First Watch is always a reliable place to hit after a night of binging or a moderate bout of dysentery, as you can always expect the food to be bland but healthful.  Barely anything on the menu is slathered in grease, which is a nice change from some of FW's competitors.  I'm not totally slamming the place: I actually like the combos they offer in terms of the sweet-savory equilibrium that's so important to me when breakfast is concerned.  The retirement home-style pastels are soothing, too.  You might expect Dorothy, Rose, and Blanche to sit down in the booth next to you at any moment.  A big FW plus is that generous seating ensures that there are barely any times when you have to wait to be seated for breakfast or lunch.  So if you can't get a seat at nearby Matt's Big Breakfast or the Park Central Good Egg, consider this egg joint."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service is good, and really healthy choices on the menu, super clean real friendly, definitely a must visit! Small portion but will fill ya up, big jug of coffee and water so you don't have to keep asking, really nice place"}
{"text":"If you are a healthy eater in the clean either they offer a great variety of juices and healthy eating foods on the menu highly recommend this place the staff is always friendly and quickly to serve you"}
{"text":"Wow, very impressed with the quality and portion with the pricing. I always worry when restaurants do not post their prices online and breakfast places can be super expensive, but this place was very very good. Kids Menu-for $6 after tax my son got the chocolate chip pancake. It's huge! And it comes with 2 bacon. Wife got the French toast. It's huge and delicious! I got the Bacado. No upgrade price for egg whites, tons of avocado and bacon in the omelet. I repeat a lot of avocado. My guess is probably half an avocado in the omelet, plus toast and seasoned potatoes, only $11. Same pricing for an omelet at ihop or Denny's give or take a buck or two. Our waitress Lauren was really good too. Keep up the good work! This is my new breakfast place!  Only negative was price for coffee. Make sure you drink 2-3 cups to get your money's worth, it was about $3 after tax."}
{"text":"I understand that it's a Saturday morning and it can take a while to be seated. We waited 45 min to be seated, ok. We finally get seated and we are warned that it can take a while for our food to come out. We think, well considering it usually takes about 15-20 for food to come out it can't be all that much longer, maybe 30 min? We were so wrong. It took over an hour to get our food, and it only came out after we complained to the manager. When the food finally came out, they brought all but one meal, which then took ANOTHER 20 min to be brought out. By the time I got my food, everyone was done. Even after this long wait the food was mediocre and hardly even warm. Also, the turkey sausage was god awful. They comped our food after the first complaint, then offered a coupon for he second complaint. Which I did not take because, why would we go back?? It was a good waste of our Saturday morning. Nothing like taking almost 3 hours to eat breakfast with two kids under the age of 5. BTW all of this happened even though they were \"fully staffed.\" Never again."}
{"text":"We ordered food for a staff meeting and specifically broke it down by name to make it easier for distribution.  When we picked up the food they had assigned numbers instead of names and didnt correlate any of it.  The gentleman that took the order on the phone was nice but the women during pick up were mean and absolutely had no customer service and could not understand their own receipt.  Every order was wrong the food was awful."}
{"text":"My family and I were frequent visitors previously when it was the Good Egg. We hadn't been in a while, so we decided to visit. What a disappointment! The menu changed, our favorite servers are gone and after waiting 15 min for a table, being seated and being ignored... We finally grabbed a server, who explained how backed up the kitchen was and our food would be a long time. Wow, we hadn't even ordered yet! So, next door to Burger Fi we went. If I could give less then one star I would have, we waited for zero service."}
{"text":"Stopped in just to check out the food cause the menu looked great. Was excited to see a large sign on the door for free WiFi and went back out to my car to grab my computer. After being sat in a booth by the hostess I pulled out my computer to find the WiFi doesn't work. No big deal was really just hungry to begin with. After about 15 minutes of sitting, no one came over or acknowledged me,  I watched a table that came in after me get drinks, and multiple servers were standing at the hostess station at any point in time because the place wasn't busy. I politely gave my menu back to the hostess and left. Really unfortunate because I wanted to try the menu but not at the cost of feeling invisible."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with two of my friends this afternoon and we had such a wonderful experience. The line we encountered when we first walked in seemed a little daunting, but the hostess assured us that the wait would be less than 20 minutes. We wandered outside to wait for our table and we stumbled upon a small seating area outside in the shade. There was a fountain and flowers--it was the prefect place to wait.  As soon as we were called back in, our bubbly, personable waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I would highly recommend the iced tea, as it wasn't sweet but it had a bold taste.   Next, week ordered our food. It came out within minutes, and it was oh so delicious! All three of us ordered the Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash off of the summer special menu (without chorizo). It was delicious! The corn was roasted to perfection and the creamy Cotija cheese was a great complement. The potatoes and and scallions in the base layer of the dish provided a savory aspect, while also making the dish significantly more filling.  To summarize, if you're looking for a decently-priced, delicious brunch with impeccable service in Phoenix, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"If this isn't a five star breakfast,  I don't know what is. The food is first rate, plentiful and creative.  They even bring large ice waters and an additional carafe to your table. That's money in Tempe."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always wonderful. This place is great. Usually a long wait for a table, but well worth it and you can always go to Trader Joe's across the way and do some quick shipping during the wait. Multitasking is a plus when at Crocker..."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Very attentive waitress who gave us the freedom to work and talk and order later.  The coffee was fresh, hot and extra caffeinated just the way you need it at a morning working breakfast.  Menu was extensive but I was told to order the eggs Benedict.  I selected Florentine with side salad.  It arrived and looked really good and at 620 calories (menu has calorie count per item) I was ready to dig in.  The hollandaise sauce was good but cold.  The poached eggs were a bit chilly too but the toast was warm so I just dug in.  We were going to tell the waitress but didn't.  We thought we overstayed our visit and we were hungry (and over caffeinated).  I will  return but Next time I will eat first and work later!"}
{"text":"They had good orange juice. I liked the chocolate chip pancake. They were nice."}
{"text":"There is always a wait but no complaints. This place is worth the wait.. such a great variety and the food OMG. I can'tsay enough good things about this place. Very well prepared and, full of great flavors. Love the food and fresh fruit drunks.  Will go back many times"}
{"text":"First off LOVE that I can add ourselves to the wait list from YELP! Place is clean, cute and great service which is always a plus. Now let's talk about the good organic food which is fresh cooked to order. Kids meals were huge for the price and came with fresh squeezed Orange juice which was great I got the biscuits and gravy which was a large portion and ordered the millionaire bacon which was sweet and yummy! Little pricey for a normal breakfast but service and food made it worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I go out to breakfast every Saturday. It's our little family tradition.   We were so disappointed at this restaurant. I ordered the Florentine Benedict and the hollandaise was bitter and split.   My husband ordered scrambled eggs but they brought him poached eggs the were chopped up. Even my son hardly touched his food, and he a human garbage disposal.   We ended up having to eat at home after. 0/10 will not return."}
{"text":"Breakfast yesterday before spring training baseball. Treated my wife's cousins who loved the quinoa salad and biscuits and turkey sausage gravy."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place. I ordered the BLT eggs Benedict which was absolutely delicious! The salad it came with was so fresh and had a refreshing, light lemon vinaigrette which was clearer made in house. The hollandaise sauce had a light and lemony flavor that complimented the salad perfectly. My husband ordered the BLTE sandwich and while I didn't try it, he loved it! The grain artisan bread looked great and it was a healthier breakfast sandwich option. For kids, they have a great selection. The two things that knocked them down from 5 stars to 4 is that it is pricier than our favorite breakfast spot downtown and they don't serve alcohol. Overall though, service was great and the food was good!"}
{"text":"Love first watch and the healthy(er,ish) items you can find there. This place is a nice reprieve from the fat laden mom and pop places which has a way of sticking around after the meal if you know what I mean. Large menu with plenty of options even for picky eaters."}
{"text":"This was our first time here:  First off, service is amazing. Eli was our server and I was impressed by his fun and welcoming nature. He gets 5 stars for sure!   The menu has a perfect assortment of options. Food was fresh and came out in a very reasonable amount of time. We enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes, chickichanga, and the works omelette. Both had coffee and bill was $33.   Decor was modern country, very cute and not cluttered like many restaurants with similar motif. We didn't know the place was here, glad we got the mailer with coupon!"}
{"text":"So thankful for First Watch because I can go out for breakfast and not feel like I'm giving myself health problems.  My favorites:  hot coffee, kale tonic, and the avocado toast with basted eggs.  I order it every time!  My wife loves the quinoa bowls, but thinks the portion is a little too much.  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot - we had the steel cut oatmeal and Avocado toast and side of bacon. Everything was very good and the coffee was top notch.  Service was quick and friendly! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast!  Healthy, delicious food and friendly wait staff. You HAVE to try the Farm Stand Tacos...yum"}
{"text":"This is my 5th visit here and I have consistently received delicious meals. Service has always been friendly and prompt as well. I highly recommend the Farm Stand Tacos for breakfast! !"}
{"text":"This First Watch was overall very good! In my experience, I joined the waitlist on a Sunday morning. We were seated within 10 minutes of actually being in the restaurant. The waitlist feature was very helpful because many people who walked in were being told the wait was 45 minutes but mine was way shorter. The food did take a long time but that was expected. In conclusion, this First Watch is a very strong choice for a morning breakfast with the fam!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place for lunch. Healthy, clean, variety of options, and fresh and delicious.  I work in Sun City and I feel my lunch options are often very limited. I drive down to First Watch in Glendale and all my food troubles have disappeared :)   The vibe is very fresh, cozy, and open. Reminds me of brunch in San Diego.  The iced tea and coffee are always so good!!!  Once I find a menu item I enjoy, it takes a lot for me to venture away from it.  I've tried several of thier options, but have remained loyal to the Power Wrap the past five or six times I've been. They do not upcharge for egg whites or sub of a side which is very nice.  I'm cutting off one-star because this place really is horrible with to-go orders. I've ordered to-go three times, and all three times there has been a glitch. It's really annoying.  Last time they just completely forgot my soup, and I was pretty disappointed.  Another time they gave wrong soup. And the first time they put in mushrooms, which I cannot stand and asked to leave out.  That was the worst because I was really hungry and they were built in the omlete wrap, unable to be picked out.  Its frustrating.  When I'm dining in, the service and food is 5 stars, when I'm picking up its a 2.  I have a favorite waiter there, tall built guy with glasses, he is so super nice!! I told him about the mushroom snafu, and he comped my whole meal. It was so super nice. I haven't told him about the soup issues though because I feel like I've learned my lesson by now and will just dine in when I have the time to escape from work for a little bit."}
{"text":"We all had great breakfasts!  Eggs Bennie with smoked salmon; the elevated egg sandwich; and a frittata.  Delicious!   Going Avocado Toast next time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I've heard about this place and how good they were. So, I had to see for myself.   I ordered the power wrap. It was delicious. I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms in the wrap, but I'm just not a fan of them things anyways. The salsa tasted fresh and it was delicious on the wrap.   I also got to sample their day glow juice and make tonic. Both were really good. The kale tonic was sweeter than I would like but it was still good.   The person o went with got the biscuits and gravy and that was WOW. Bomb. Them potatoes too, legit."}
{"text":"I went at 1 on a Friday.  No wait!  I love the atmosphere and the trendy decor.  I had the Floridian Fresh toast.  It was wonderful!  The French toast was a bit crispy around the edges, which was perfect.  All of our food was prepared as we had asked and our service was great!    The menu is more California style with the avocado and wheat grains.  But if you don't enjoy that, don't let it deter you from going.  You'll find something you like!"}
{"text":"For being someone that typically prefers a local joint over a chain this place gets high marks for service and menu creativity. Let's face it, eastsiders have a pretty limited range of choices when it comes to breakfast joints (or any other restaurants for that matter), so I am happy to add a great breakfast place to my repertoire. There was 3 different menu items that I had a hard time choosing between for brunch, I settled on the Chickenchanga per the servers recommendation and boy was that thing deee-licious! The salsa verde that was served alongside it was excellent and I'd be happy topping just about anything in that sauce. The service was good, on par with what one would expect. I really enjoyed the oversized booths, there was enough room to spread out, something you typically don't find in breakfast joints. All in all, I can't wait to return to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to spend some quite time with Loved ones! Excellent service by Chantelle! Excellent food! Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love it here! I've had great service every time I've come - which is quite a lot - and have thoroughly enjoyed every meal! I love the iced coffee (note: it comes pre sweetened) and my can't miss sides are their muffins and breakfast potatoes - both of which are fresh and taste just like my mom's!  So grateful to have this place local for a quick lunch or late breakfast away from the office!"}
{"text":"Great location for a great breakfast spot.  We arrived early on Sunday before the church crowd showed up so we were seated right away.  The Bocado and coffee are always great and a fantastic way to start the day off."}
{"text":"I got a mushroom and I believe green chili omelette. What they did was cook up some egg whites, then pour a can of mushrooms in the middle along with the mushroom juice/water from the can. It was one of the grossest breakfast experiences of my life. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Dirty dishes, slow service, and food was nothing to write home about.  Home fries were dry and flavorless.  My omelet was basically an egg taco and tasted kinda fishy.   I ordered cold brew coffee and they brought me watered down hot coffee that obviously wasn't cold brew.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"With all the hype, I was expecting more. My wife and I decided to have a nice Sunday brunch at this \"hot and new\" place. There were a number of people waiting outside to be seated so that is usually a good sign. We noticed the patio was available so when we saw the hostess she said 20-30 min even though the patio was nearly empty and there were a number of tables empty inside. We did not start with a warm welcome.   Food was OK, had the salmon Benedict and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. Both were underwhelming however it did taste fresh.   Will give another shot but not holding my breath."}
{"text":"Let me just start that I love the decor and the atmosphere that I feel when I come here. The food is also decently sized, and they have a lot of healthier alternatives. Staff is also really friendly. What I don't enjoy about First Watch here is that it takes FOREVER to get your food. Literally, you'd have to wait at least 20 minutes after the waitress takes your order to actually get your food. If First Watch actually fixes this issue, then I would come here every weekend."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. Expected it to be like the good egg which is the chain they are replacing but it was much much better! Service: 5 stars, everyone was extremely nice, helpful and quick.  Menu: 4 stars, they had a great selection, something for everyone. Including seasonal choices and a \"lighter side\" menu. Although I found it a tad odd most breakfast choices came with a side salad Food: 4 stars, everything we got tasted great. However I was adventurous and tried the salad that came with my breakfast and it just a spring mix with hardly any dressing. Overall this place really hit the spot and would definitely come back for a quick, simple breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch several times for lunch. Their menu has options for differents tastes. The entrees are delicious and reasonably priced! The waiters are very friendly and the decor is simple but pretty."}
{"text":"This place is shot out, pretty sure our server hadn't slept in about 2 days. Food was pretty good but the used syringe outside in the parking lot and the tin foil in the bathroom just killed it for me."}
{"text":"The food was good, and they didn't rush us out even though they were about to close.  Great place for breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"Hit this place on a  Saturday morning. It was busy but we were seated pretty fast. I ordered a simple breakfast of bacon and eggs, whole my son had an omelet. The order came in good time,  it we both thought our eggs were a bit dry. My bacon was over cooked and one piece was burnt.  The potatoes were really good and the toast was good. Service good, price fair, food okay. Happy"}
{"text":"I had breakfast there this morning and it was fantastic! Arrived about 10 and it was packed about 25 minute wait. Our server was very friendly and was attentive just enough not overly attentive. Coffee was great and tried the meditation drink, which interesting. I had the breakfast tacos, my husband had the chickichanga and we split a lemon berry pancake. It was all amazing, very much worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am not typically a fan of chain restaurants, however this one is a welcomed change to the choices we have in Bridgeville, PA.  I have been looking forward the opening of First Watch in Bridgeville. It did not disappoint.  To start, Aileen was my server and she was sweet, bubbly and very informative.  I had ordered the Chickichanga with a side of pico.  It was fantastic.  The avocado was plentiful (which isn't always the case in some restaurants).  I had a Kale Tonic and tea to drink.  Both were excellent.  The tea came with many choices of tea, a pot of hot water, lemon and honey.  The Kale Tonic was delicious and I am told that everything in it is whole and natural (no flavors from a pump bottle).  I look forward to coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"Just in town for a wedding and decided to visit this place. Our waiter Natalie was awesome. We tried some fresh pressed juices, Bacardi omelet, elevated egg sandwich, power quinoa, Greek yogurt bowl, and a orange cranberry muffin. All good were fresh and delicious. Pricing was just right too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was in great walking distance to JCU and conveniently located. The food was fresh and made well. My favorite was the walnut salad. This salad was amazing. If you like great tasting food and want the best breakfast, brunch, or lunch of your life, try this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service and they are very unorganized. We went here on a Saturday am, there were plenty of tables open and the hostess was very stressed out and put us on a wait then when others came in she got even more into stress(crisis) and finally seated us. There was a lot of staff working so I'm not sure why. Food was ok, but nothing special. We each got 1 breakfast mean, no drinks and our bill was $25... With tip, we got out of there with a $30 bill...."}
{"text":"I know with all the health tends out there that is menu is appealing to many, but not to me. Just a basic breakfast is all I ask for."}
{"text":"Yes indeed it is no longer The Good Egg. I'm kinda disappointed with everything. How they run the restaurant, the service, and the food was not that great. I walked in and was greeted in a very rudely tone. There was 2 hostesses and neither of them communicated with each other well. One wanted me to sit at the bar where I refused, and the other wanted me to share a table with another group since I was alone. I refused and asked to wait for an open table to sit alone. After 15 minutes rambling around they finally seated me with this very rude waitress. I was very obligated to leave cause I waited quite awhile and I was hungry for some breakfast. Order their skillet and the food came out cold and potatoes tasted stale. Its like their food was sat out for awhile and they just threw some cheese, potatoes, ham, and drizzle some oil to fake that its a skillet. I wanted to let the waitress know but she drop the food off without saying anything and I never saw her again until I was done eating. Seriously? What is wrong with this place. Very upset and I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Great filling breakfast, many choices, higher priced but yummy. Be sure to tell waitstaff any substitutions ahead of time or they give you guff. Fast service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Really fresh ingredients, no extra charge for egg whites, or sharing. Free newspaper if you ask for it. Home made breads and muffins are delicious! Service was prompt and very friendly. So many great looking items on the menu, I had a really hard time choosing! Can't wait to get back to Phoenix to eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a breakfast place my folks use to take us to back in New York called the Pancake House in Greenlawn, NY.  The food is delicious, and geared towards a healthy lifestyle. You can find all protein breakfasts too all veggie meals. They are very accommodating and polite. Sometimes there is a wait on Sunday morning because of the church going crowds."}
{"text":"I have been a First-Watch regular for 9 years. If you like a hearty breakfast with a stron lean towards healthy then this is yr place!  Highly recommended the avocado-toast and the juice drinks. Delicious!  On weekends: expect there to be a wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Menu is extensive .  Service is friendly. We stopped on our way to airport to fly back home. Great end to a fantastic vacation."}
{"text":"You can always count on yelp! Need to find a breakfast spot where we can make a quick stop and this place came up on yelp search. A large selection of freshly made healthy food as well as meat and potatoes selections :-) for very satisfying portion of breakfast for three, we spent less than $50. I wish seat was more comfortable but that is the only small complain I have. Everything else was solid 5 stars. Oh... and the best pancakes I had in Phoenix!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In search of a non-Panera lunch, we gave this place a try on a whim. From the looks of the plates all around me, First Watch does more business as a breakfast place, which might partially explain why our lunch orders were so-so. Or, in my case, came out wrong--a sandwich that was supposed to be turkey came out ham. (Our service, though, was otherwise good.)  The real reason we won't be returning: boredom. The interior of the restaurant is sterile and plain, and for $10 a person before tip, the lunch food is only a smidge up from food made more easily at home. And with the Market District cafe right across the street...you get the idea."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. The ambiance is casual and inviting, the staff has never been anything but friendly, quick and helpful. Food is overall health conscious and after going there for two years (especially after the gym) I have never had anything sub-par. They make substitutions easily, I have always ordered the Bacado omelet but substituted turkey sausage and gotten it with egg whites. My current favorite is the avocado toast, generous avocado on whole grain toast, with a side of over easy eggs with herbs. Perfect for post-workout fuel. I highly recommend First Watch!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for lunch. Why haven't I tried it earlier? Well, the name and logo turned us off. One of us thought it was a security company, and another thought it was a religious reading room. Yeah...we never noticed the fork.  Very clean, nice atmosphere. Lots of healthful options on the menu.   I had the Santa Fe salad. It was filled with fresh ingredients, and very tasty.   My friend had the quinoa with cherries. Looked incredible. She was very happy with it. Too much to finish, and she took the rest home.  The breakfast options looked good; I may try those next.    No one tried to sell us a security system, or make us read any tracts. Go figure."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast and lunches. Nice thing, especially if you want things a little different than everybody else does them."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant for breakfast. Found one in Florida too and their food is consistently wonderful! Staff is friendly. Food is so fresh and reasonably priced. Will return in future!"}
{"text":"Usually great food.  Lately been very inconsistent.  Food came out cold this morning.  Toast was so cold the butter wouldnt melt, same with my pancake.  Eggs were cold as well.  BUT the bacon was hot and it was good....even though it came out 10 minutes after the rest of my breakfast.  Tramonto  location needs to get their act together again....been very disappointed lately.  Oh...last time I was there, one of the waitresses grabbed a full jug of water for one of her tables from the bus boy who had literally just cleared that same jug from a table with other dirty dishes.  Not sure what is going on over there.  Hope they see this and take it to heart!"}
{"text":"Place was quiet at 6.30 but got hopping by 7.30. Staff was friendly  and attentive.  They have an extensive  menu. Food was good and noise level  was low"}
{"text":"First visit with some friends. Parking sucks but wait wasnt very long to get seated. I ordered a Monterey club sandwich with a side of fruit. Was pretty decent. Will probrably return to try other items."}
{"text":"Our server, Mercedes, was super helpful and attentive towards all of our dining needs. The food was great, service was even better. 10/10 we're gonna dine again."}
{"text":"Good visit to First Watch. Staff was friendly and kind. I got there a little early. So I enjoyed a coffee while I waited for a friend. Their traditional breakfast is always a classic choice. Your choice of meat and style of eggs. Their bacon is always a good choice and artisan bread is super yummy. Their service is quick and good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This location used to be a Good Egg, which was pricey but much better. Now the menu is ok the service is mediocre and the food quality to price is very bad.  We went about 2 months ago and went back today because we had a coupon BOGO entree. Coupon or not we won't be back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I received a $20 voucher from First Watch to try this location again. We went back on a Monday morning and were immediately greeted at the door and sat at a booth. Our server came back promptly with our drinks and was attentive throughout our meal. My boyfriend ordered the Elevated Egg Sandwich which was amazing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were seasoned well. I ordered the seasonal Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash and the seasonal Rainbow Toast. The hash was flavorful and a good portion, but the corn was pretty much nonexistent in it. I enjoyed it but it definitely needed more of the corn that it was named after. The rainbow toast was a wonderful idea that was poorly executed. The brioche bread was slightly burned and the mango was small frozen pieces. Why have a seasonal special if you're not going to use fresh fruit that's in season? All in all this was a far better experience than the first, and we'll be back. My advice is to just stick to regular menu items and don't try the specials."}
{"text":"The pork belly bacon and grits is fantastic. Very well made and very tasty. Bread was great too. Complimentary coffee is always good to offer:). Friendly staff and homely vibe."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really bad slow service and rude employees....well my friend you are in luck!!!.First Watch cafe is the place for you. If you dont care waiting forever for your order to come to your table specially when the coversation with your friend is interesting First Watch cafe is your place. The food's good and prices are reasonable and portions are just right. Unfortunately, the staff makes it not worth it . You have been warned!!Have breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Always very busy. Get there early. Pretty unusual food for breakfast and very nice presentations. A bit pricey. But you know that going in."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'll be back!! Deliciousness!! Millionaire Bacon and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and now I'm fat and happy!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a while!!! Super fresh and great portions! Excellent service and great atmosphere to wake up with! Next time I stop by I have to try the juice bar!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Eventhough its a chain, I don't think it feels like one. Nice folks millenial food on the menu, but its all goos. I had the french toast, very nicely done! Loved it."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot I have tried about half of the menu because we like to eat breakfast out. Everything so far has been delicious especially the blue berry pancakes."}
{"text":"Slow inattentive service. Poor quality food. This place is Eat N Park sans the folksy charm."}
{"text":"What a fantastic breakfast spot! Never had bad service, never had a bad meal. Huge fan of the power wrap, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a big brunch fan but needed to feed family in for thanksgiving a nice breakfast. Couldn't have been more pleased. Didn't know it was a chain, but I am glad it's in the neighborhood now. My father had the salmon frittata and raved about that and the nice yeasty ciabatta toast he got with it. I wanted something light and got their soup of then day - perfect after the gorge fest that is thanksgiving. So nice. Servers were awesome. And watching the crew in the kitchen work well together from our seats nearby, who showed great professionalism, was also nice to see. So happy this new place is nearby."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to First Watch I feel like I'm going to a little diner.  The service is great and the food is great too.  They have a great selection of egg white omelets that you can choose from.    My favorite thing about First watch is that they leave you the whole pot of coffee at your table.  :)  The turkey sausage and egg white omelet is really good.    While if you are in the area and when some breakfast.  You should come here.  It is definitely better then Ihop or Denny's."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at First Watch today and it's always great food -- I got the lemon ricotta pancakes which I've never had but they were really great. However, big shout out to Cory who was our server this morning. He was on top of the service, pleasant and there to answer any menu questions, bring us what we needed! Great personality and he even brought me a to-go iced tea without me asking! Three things I look for when dining -- good service, good food, and good ambiance. I can live with mediocre food and ambiance some times but if the service isn't good, then I will never return to a restaurant! Great job First Watch, on ALL three of my requirements! And thanks Cory for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place I usually come once or twice a week. I've never had a bad experience until today...  our server was just rude, she looked like she was having a terrible day and you could just tell in her face. I'm not expecting for her to be super smiley with us but she wasn't even checking up on us. We wanted to order more stuff and when she finally came around she had our check!!I'm just a  disappointed with that girl, I didn't get her name but she had two braids. I will definitely stay away from this place from now on.. I just don't understand how people can be so rude..."}
{"text":"Absolutely magical! Good to average service! Excellent vibes very chill and original, and welcoming. I got the matcha pancakes on special delicious! All the good my family and I ordered was perfect! All organic and fresh but not to pricey for quality food! Nothing but good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and excellent service. Miss the old menu items but the food really is great. The check in system hat let's you see your place in line is efficient and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to other FirstWatch restaurants and have had great food and service. This location was unfriendly to say the least and the food was nowhere near the quality I have had at other locations. I ordered the bacon and onion hash with scrambled eggs really well done. My food came out with the eggs still wet and the rest of my food was burnt. I took the eggs off the rest of the food prompting the waitress to come back asking about our meal. They took the plate with eggs back (including my English muffin and fruit) and literally put the same eggs back in a pan and BURNT them. They brought the burnt eggs back to the table but never brought back my English muffin or fruit. When I asked them to take the burnt eggs away because the smell was overwhelming they were rude and didn't say a word. I asked to only pay for the part of the meal I was able to eat, since I couldn't eat the eggs and was never given the fruit or English muffin. The waitress was beyond rude and only removed $2 from my $10 meal. As I was paying, another waitress was nice enough to remove my meal from the check. It was hard not to notice the waitresses and cook staff talking about me and staring at me from the kitchen. I will not be returning to this FirstWatch location. Do yourself a favor and drive to the University Heights location."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes before the server spoke to us. Then waited 30 more minutes for eggs and bacon that wasn't cooked all the way. Everyone seems to think bussing is not their problem because plates sat the entire time we were there so birds attacked the plates and shat everywhere (we sat outside). Would not recommend, would not go back."}
{"text":"I have gone to a few First Watch restaurants, but this one is my favorite!  The food is excellent!  I love the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!  Other favorites are the Bacado Omelet, and the Farmhouse Hash. Their toast is amazing!  Thick, artisanal bread with fresh preserves.  I'm usually full and end up taking the toast home.    The customer service at this location is amazing!  They have been able to make any substitutions that I have asked for.  I usually get the Day Glow juice (now removed from the menu), but the Morning Meditation juice always sounded interesting but I was afraid of the one of the ingredients (beet juice).  My friend felt the same way so we asked if there was anyway we could try as small sample.  They came out with a fairly large size samples (3 to 4 full sips).  And that is how the Morning Mediation became my new favorite juice."}
{"text":"First watch has the years to prove their excellence.Everything they make is perfectly prepared and you don't have to wait long at all."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast there EVERY WEEKDAY.  The food, service, personal attention makes this the best stop of the day.  Food is very consistent and priced right.  Eggs always perfect.  Coffee served in thermos pot.  Time from order placed to food served is almost immediate.  Have never had anything but great experience.  John, Stacy, and all the crew will pamper you. LKcowboy"}
{"text":"Excellent! The Lemon Ricotta pancakes and million dollar bacon were awesome! I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation of my daughter. If the 20 minute wait on a Tuesday morning is any indication it must be good.  Can only imagine the mad House this place must be on a weekend."}
{"text":"Outstanding service today.  I am visiting my cousin and she suggested this place after our morning walk.  The hostess was pleasant and seated us promptly.  Our server came and took our drink order.  She was courteous and answered our questions about the various menu items.  I had hot chocolate, cheese grits, and a large chicken chickenmanga.  My cousin  had the Belgian waffle, a side of scrambled eggs, and tea.  The food was the perfect temperature and it was delicious. A very nice interior and a small four table patio outside.  A large menu made choosing what we wanted difficult.  Loved the fact that calories were listed on the menu as well.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great variety in menu. Place has a very positive energy with the decor and etc. there are plenty of healthy options in menu to choose from. We loved this place for brunch and will be returning again for sure."}
{"text":"I didn't really \"get it.\"  Strange decor, lots of large/group tables which eats up much needed space for small parties.  Food was good, but I thought portions were a bit small for the price.  If I'm in the area again, I may stop in, but I'm not going out of my way for a meal."}
{"text":"Our server was super helpful and kind. But between the time we ordered our food and got our meal we watched two other tables get seated, order their food, finish their, food clear their tables, and get the bill.  Our order wasn't complicated. Two of us ordered the same thing and the third was a child's pancake meal.  Upon leaving the restaurant, I noticed the sidewalk sandwich board had a note that made light of servers in cages.  It was tastless at best, but in a city with a history of trafficking victims and child abuse victims kept in cages, it was gross.  Actually, on second thought . . . Jokes about slavery are ALWAYS a very bad idea for a business."}
{"text":"what A JOY TO FIND THIS RESTAURANT IN Scottsdale AFTER MANY OTHER DISAPPOINTING MEALS AT OTHER RESTAURANTS IN TOWN.  My husband ordered the traditional breakfast and I had the Pecan Chicken Salad, which was delicious. Portions were large and tasty.  The waitress was attentive and suggested items for us to try.  Very good prices compared to many others in this expensive town.  I heartily recommend this cafe for breakfast or brunch, and know you won't be disappointed,  We ate here 3 out of 5 days for brunch and it was always good food.r"}
{"text":"Good food & service. Usually crazy busy on the weekends!! A must here for us is their lemon ricotta pancakes, they taste better than they sound I promise!! I also like that they have complimentary coffee & ice water while you wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I've been to the University Heights location a few times but I've only dined at the Mayfield Heights location once, the day after Thanksgiving.  The decor is very rustic -- lots of wood -- and very homey looking.  I don't know if all the locations have changed to this type of decor but we really liked it!  There were four of us and everyone really enjoyed our food.  The waitress was very attentive on an extremely busy day.  It's nice to know that there is such a nice breakfast/brunch/lunch spot close to home and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Best food and service..ever!! Love this place!! Their food is so unique and so delicious. I wish they were open for dinner too!"}
{"text":"This is a decent breakfast place and the price was fair compared to many competitors. My wife had the bacavacado omelet which I spelled wrong. She says it was great. My Florida French toast had fruit on it which was ok. It was mostly bread and didn't work for me. Our waiter had too many table so service wasn't great. My wife liked him. We would go again."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of breakfast chain restaurants but First Watch is very close to where I live, and I've heard good things about their other locations so I decided to give it a try. I've been here twice so far and have learned that their menu varies from their other restaurants which makes it seem less corporate and more local. Each time I've visited the wait was around 5 -10 minutes, not too bad for a Saturday and Sunday. They offer a large array of breakfast and lunch options, and specials that are seasonal. I tried the avocado toast on my first visit and my husband had the chikichangas. On my second visit I had the veg'd out omelet and my husband had the turkey burger. We both enjoyed our food at each of our visits, my dishes were simple yet tasted delicious and fresh. It's nice to have a casual and reasonably priced option in the Biltmore area because there are very few around. They also have healthy options, so when my husband wants to indulge (which is most of the time) and I'm trying to stay disciplined this places offers something for both of us. First Watch stands out among the other breakfast chain restaurants, I will definitely be adding this into my rotation."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and reasonably priced.. The Belgian Waffle was one of the best I have ever had, we had a great waiter very attentive n quick with all request. Will b back again.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to this First Watch every Saturday and have yet to have a bad experience. We have had nothing but great service since coming here the past 3 months and the good is just delicious.  I want to give a shout out to Kim and Jon who go out of their way to say hello to us and make us feel welcome each time we come in.   Like I said, the food is great! While we have tried almost everything on the menu, my boyfriend loves the breakfast tacos and no matter what I always come back to the lemon ricotta pancakes.   I have recommended First Watch to people looking for a great new breakfast cafe and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our Tuesday morning breakfast. Charming place and friendly staff. It was unfortunate that the hostess was our server AND the cashier also. She did a great job holding it all together but they could have used more people to run the place.  Our pancakes and French toast were delightful. I'm thrilled to have some healthy menu items (even if I didn't choose them today). I was disappointed about the $4.29 up-sell for the bacon that 'sounded' like it was included. I felt like she sort of took advantage of the kids by asking. Overall, I'm glad to have a small business to support. They've made a good start to being an integral part of the community. Thanks for being there. I look forward to to visiting again."}
{"text":"We are from Florida and love First Watch, but there are a lot of things that need to be ironed out. I know it's still new and hopefully this review will help. Our waitress needs more experience to start. Brought us the wrong drinks at first and then the second time I had asked both times for no ice and it came out with ice so i just drank it. The sweet tea was unsweet and the waitress kept saying it was sweet tea. The kids meal was suppose to come with fresh fruit and bacon and she forgot the bacon.  When we asked for the bacon, the waitress charged us for a \"side\" of bacon. The register cannot fix these errors making it difficult as they had to hunt our waitress down during a busy rush to fix the charge. In addition to all this, the potatoes were burned for both of our meals. Unfortunately, there was never a manager coming around to see how things were and every table around us was having similar experiences.  We are hopeful that things will improve as we really do enjoy First Watch. Just an FYI for management, every time a drink was brought (remembering we got the wrong drinks and refills etc, the waitress kept giving us new straws which we had so many on the table at the end and this can really eat into budgets for restaurants)."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, trendy options and friendly staff. My favorite is their Morning Meditation, cold brew and avocado toast. My hubby loved the Roast Beef & Havarti sandwich. One bad thing about this location is they are always slammed with customers. Its crowded, loud and always has a line out the door."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast this morning at first watch cafe. I've driven by this restaurant many times and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! The menu has a large variety of food to chose from. I had the chickichanga which is 2 eggs chicken breast, chorizo, onion, green pepper in a flour tortilla. I got it with country potatoes and fresh fruit. The food was excellent and service was great. I look forward to going back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The menu was extremely impressive. They had lots to choose from and most were unique in a way. The prices were average and surprisingly the salmon options were not extremely expensive like other breakfast places. I got a Florentine Benedict and it had tossed greens on the side. Unfortunately, the egg was extremely over cooked, it did not ooze over like an average Benedict. I was poking at the egg for a while and I thought it was a chunk of cream cheese because it was so over cooked. There was very little hollandaise sauce on it as well. This made the bread underneath hard to cut. Little hollandaise and not a properly poached egg makes the entire plate dry. Not the best Benedict I've had. On the brighter side the atmosphere is lovely, and clean! The waiter was great! Maybe I'll try something new next time...."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast/brunch place! We got the egg benedicts with salmon and biscuits and gravy. My favorite part about egg benedicts is the hollandaise sauce; unfortunately I was quite deceived with this one: it wasn't as flavorful and creamy as I expected. The biscuits and gravy however were amazing!! I really enjoyed the fact that the gravy is made with Turkey sausage, and it really tasted amazing! The service was also very friendly.  Will definitely go back to this place but might look for something else than egg benedicts next time, since a lot of things on the menu sounded great!"}
{"text":"I've repeatedly tried to like this place since they changed their name from Good Egg and also changed their menu. Went there this morning and had the Power Wrap. Service was slow and food was extremely dry. Most items on the menu seem to be over a thousand calories and just don't appeal to me. Omelettes and traditional breakfast seems to have been purposely left off the menu. Since the place was virtually empty, I have to presume that others are agreeing with my evaluation of the First Watch experience. I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what this place was until my friend came to visit from Florida. I'm happy he invited me out for breakfast. They have a very healthy menu which is what I liked most."}
{"text":"i just found out about a site that gives complete food inspection reports in cuyhoga county= cuy. cty. board of health.  i used to eat here but never again.  they are dirty!  they had 4 critical violations, equal to a \"d\" rating.  i am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hubs and I went here for brunch this past Saturday. Love the new get in line app portion on yelp - it was really convenient, but slightly confusing that you get in line on the app but aren't added to the real list til you get there. Hubby got the Trifecta and loved it. He also got a plain hot coffee - said it was good but nothing to write home about. I got the traditional Eggs Benedict with potatoes and an extra side of hollandaise. The benny was a large portion and delicious. Hollandaise was really lemony and not as rich as I'd like, but the flavors still balanced really well together with the potatoes. Sweet & Creamy iced coffee was amazing and just how Iike it :D"}
{"text":"Good service, very good food, clean, amiable atmosphere. Kids loved the millionaire's bacon. Good coffee"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  I love all of the traditional (with a spin) & non - traditional options.  Best coffee I have tasted at a restaurant by far.   Decor is awesome as well.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in the door, you could tell this was a place that was going to feel like home. The people were awesome and friendly. The service was superb and the food amazing.   I came for a business lunch meeting and the atmosphere is such that you can eat and have a conversation at the same time. The salad was fresh and tasted amazing.   I cannot wait to go back and while this location is not in my normal area, it is one that I will keep in mind for all my meetings when I am in this area.   Thank you for the great meal and a place that meetings can occur outside of my stuffy office!!"}
{"text":"I could not be happier with the changeover- Loved it when it was Good Egg- But now, it's taking breakfast up a notch! There are tons of what I call \"overly\" healthy options which I am sure the trendy hipsters and fu fu people will love, but within that, there are also amazing well put together breakfast and lunch combos with unique and delicious ingredients that will blow you away! My wife and I split a Lemon Pancake thing that was outrageously good, and also a Chile Chorizo Omelet which blew us away! Both were very good and unlike most other restaurants that try to infuse new flavors by soaking or drenching them, both of these plates were not overdone in the least bit; every flavor came roaring out of the gates, with a delicate touch, yet confident flavor profile. SUPER DELISH is all I can say.  The Decor was super cool, and was hip and trendy without being overdone or cheesy. The Service was all smiles all the way.. Loved, Loved our waitress, Anna; I could see the kindness in her eyes! We appreciated it!  BTW, You need to order a half glass of the Morning Meditation! It was super delicious and very much \"Overly\" good for you! Can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Little restaurant tucked into a strip mall. People were friendly and service was good. Place if relatively clean. It's a good environment to take the kids. I ordered the pumpkin pancake special. Food was good and fresh. My only complaint is the portion size of the special. I got one thin pancake maybe ten inches across, one very thin chicken sausage patty, and two very small eggs. Really a shame they have it listed as a special especially when they are charging $10. They will also upgrade your syrup to maple syrup for an additional dollar something. Food was good but the value is not there. Shame."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here with my kids.  The food is fresh, the service has always been great, and their seasonal specials are always spot on tasty.  The menu has something for everyone, from the health nuts to the gluttonous (yes Million Dollar Bacon, it's all you).  We never leave dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great people, great service, great super healthy food. I recommend them to anyone looking for healthy clean food and with diverse options."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is great and out quickly. Coffee is always hot & tasty! This is our go-to breakfast spot! Plus you can sub almost anything, including egg whites, for no extra charge. They're very accommodating, especially for those of us who have to eat gluten free. So happy we found First Watch!"}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood but didn't even know it existed, probably because it was mostly hidden from view by I-17 and its fences. So it was good that Rand H. invited me to join him and Mike C. here for weekday brunch.  This place has friendly service, a sunny interior with a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable, if slightly cramped, booths and tables. I ordered \"The Works\" which is an omelet with ham, bacon, sausage, crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with cheddar and monterey jack. topped with sour cream, and chose a mixed green salad as a side. The omelet was good and was a moderate-size portion; it would still qualify as a light lunch. The mixed green salad was nothing special. The coffee was delicious and was refilled in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to bring friends to for a nice leisurely breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My new go to for a healthy weekend breakfast or brunch! The avocado toast did not disappoint and they pile on the avocado. Great service with friendly staff. Can't beat that combination!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to have First Watch close to home. Everything is very fresh. Their house made juices are are unique."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place to take family when they're in town. Great service in a welcoming environment. Every new thing i try from here is great, even their special juices!"}
{"text":"My party of four decided to grab a quick lunch and since First Watch was close by, we elected to pay it a visit. Our server was friendly, if relaxed....the place wasn't busy, so the relaxed service wasn't a problem. The husband and I both ordered the half sandwich/soup or salad combo (veggie sandwich for both of us, butternut squash soup for him, tomato basil soup for me). Both were good, the sandwich especially so. Price for the combo was just under $8. My first minor complaint was that the bowl of soup was pretty small, more like a cup, and the sandwich half was moderate in size. Perhaps I was hungry? My second minor complaint/observation was that our server initially gave us the incorrect bill. Not a big deal in the long run, but small details do contribute to the overall experience....and overall, I'd come here again and give First Watch a second chance. After all, that sandwich half was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"By far the best place for breakfast/brunch. The food is great. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"Literally so good! I had the \"Baconado\" omelet and it was delish! Fresh pico de gallo with jalapeños and all fresh ingredients. My boyfriend got the elevated egg sandwich- he ate it in about 2 minutes  great service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Ordered To-Go for an office party of five and it was ready in under fifteen minutes.   The glow juice was so fresh and veggie-concentrated. At only $3.99 it was a steal as compared to most juice shops.   I had the market hash. It was delicious! The potatoes were a little mushy which was a nice change from your standard hash. I really enjoyed the flavors. It came with the hash, two eggs, and one large piece of toast with jam and butter.   The tomato soup was delicious! Very creamy and fortunately vegetarian.   My coworkers all got the egg sandwich and were extremely happy with them. The bacon was huge!   Overall very happy with the service and food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here--great food, great service, kid friendly (but not obnoxious for kid-free families). We love the family atmosphere and convenient location. There's usually a wait but never very long."}
{"text":"Every time I visit my family in Ohio, I go to First Watch.   I am a vegetarian, and the kitchen is very accommodating to my dietary needs. Not only do they have many options for ovo-lacto vegetarians, but also will remove meat from most dishes without an up-charge.   I usually get the Pesto Chicken Quinoa bowl without the chicken. This was actually the dish that introduced me to the grain and began my love affair with this iron rich grain. I also recommend the Market Hash, which I got today, containing mixed vegetables and breakfast potatoes topped with eggs cooked to order.  The servers are very friendly.  My aunt wanted her muffin warmed.  The server asked if she wanted it warmed on the grill with or without butter. The muffin was returned toasty warm and buttered promptly, and the manager checked on the taste of the muffin.   I highly recommend this place. It's one of my favorite breakfast restaurants, and I would come more often of I lived in the area."}
{"text":"So fantastic!! I was planning on taking a picture of the food but there was no time it just looked and smelled too fantastic... it truly tasted that way as well. Lovely calm atmosphere with relaxing music. Awesome place for a date not too expensive and looks trendy. If you go remember to get a glass of orange juice it's fresh squeezed and I guarantee it'll be the best decision you make that day!"}
{"text":"This is your typical brunch place. They have quite a few breakfast and lunch items to select from. I got the pumpkin pancake and the works omelet. Both were about the same price (under $9), but the works was way more worth it than the pumpkin pancake. The pancake dish came with only 1 slice of pancake and some eggs, while the works had pretty much every typical breakfast items in it (sausage, bacon, mushrooms, etc). Definitely recommend trying the works omelet!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I have been at first watch in the last month, it is my new favorite breakfast place in Gilbert.  I've tried three different breakfast entrées and each one has been wonderful. The service has been excellent, and even when there's a wait, it has not been very long."}
{"text":"I came and had the brisket skillet and man let me say thank you. Haha I love bbq and breakfast so it was the best combination I've ever had.  my daughter had the chocolate chip pancake, and it tasted exactly like a chocolate chip cookie! I liked it more than she did! My hub got biscuits and gravy, and I'd get fat off of that too! I'd go here everyday for breakfast! Its definitely my top 3 places for breakfast now!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the florentine eggs Benedict. I like how they served it with fresh greens as opposed to potatoes. Service was spot on, Alex our server was attentive without lingering. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Went for an early breakfast today. Power quinoa bowl was delicious! Wife enjoyed the traditional breakfast which was scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. Coffee was good as well. Great restaurant and would like to try one of the fresh juices next time"}
{"text":"The appearance is nice and cozy. The menu is simple with few choices. I was excited to try the Power quinoa bowl, wife orders salmon eggs Benedict and kiddo got French toast. The wait seemed a little long after ordering, long enough to finish all the coffee and water while waiting. The food came out and looked amazing! And that's when 2 stars fell! After getting our food we were completely ignored. French toast had no syrup, drinks were empty, no napkins and no service to help. I do know that some old lady fell in the parking lot but it seemed as though every employee was more concerned about what was going on outside the restaurant. Twice I tried to flag someone down but to no avail. Finally someone came to our table only to give us a check.  I felt like we didn't exist, we miss the good egg and unfortunately due to first impressions not sure if I'll go back.   PS I did power thru the whole quinoa bowl and felt empowered after doing so!"}
{"text":"Polite, happy greeter Open, clean space-industrial country Nice benches & table/chairs Food excellent-all fresh & high quality Table had the following: biscuits Avocado toast Biscuits & sausage gravy  Frittata  Eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"The menu had an amazing selection of healthy delicious options!! It was difficult to choose only one from such great selections!! The food was healthy, good & beautifully presented.  The kids meals were the perfect portion size for my hungry kiddos.  The service was really friendly & great.  We highly roccomend others to come here & we will be back as well."}
{"text":"Solid good food, reasonable prices. Now that The Good Egg is merging into First Watch all my dreams are coming true! This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Phoenix. I always enjoy their hot coffee with lactose free cream. One of the few breakfast places that offers that. The bacon is absolutely delicious, I recommend getting it crispy. But one of my favorite dishes quinoa bowl. It has incredible flavor and is actually good for you. It's not often you can have a big breakfast actually feel good about it, with this dish you can.  Pancakes and eggs are always delicious, and the granola banana pancakes with peanut butter are to die for. My only caution is that you will get a lot of food. So don't order everything on the menu or you won't have room to eat it. :)"}
{"text":"Love it here! The staff is always friendly and they know exactly what we like! Thats a plus ! We enjoy the cofee and french vanilla creamer, wich is no charge for extra cream. Other breakfast places charged us in the past wich is annoying."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this location 2 stars is because the food is ok, but this review has nothing to do with the food.   I call ahead to restaurants before I come because I know some have a no dog policy. When I called to make sure I could bring my dog I was told \"no problem\". I said \"great, see you soon\". Well, when I arrive to ask to sit outside, I am told that I have to leave my dog on the outside of the gate! Apparently tying him to the fence is fine, but god forbid he lay nicely underneath the table. To top it off, I was NOT told on the phone that he would have to be on the outside! I would NEVER have wasted my time going all the way down there to eat breakfast if I was told that beforehand. Next time tell your servers, host/hostesses and managers to be very clear about what kind of dog policy you have! I won't be back to this location and know I will make sure I tell everyone I know that your staff knows nothing about what your restaurant policies are."}
{"text":"First watch was awesome! Hubby and I went on Mother's day and even though it was packed we were seated pretty quickly.  Great customer service and the food was really delicious.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Super clean restaurant, love the decor and atmosphere. This used to be the Good Egg, and the remodeling was well done. I had the Millionaire's Bacon and organic coffee- and both were delicious! I will come back here again. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit to First Watch in the last month. The service on the first trip was somewhat slow but not at all on this visit.  We had Jasmine as our waitress and she was friendly and very attentive. The food has been great on both visits--this is definitely a place one could label as serving the breakfast for champions. Great pancakes, creative egg's Benedict choices and wonderful toasted breads. I had poached eggs and a toasted piece of thick bakery quality bread topped with burrata and tomatoes. Excellent meal with top-notch service. The addition of placing extra coffee pots on tables and water containers reducing the need to chase down wait staff and makes so much sense!"}
{"text":"Really good fresh breakfast but, can be kind of expensive for a breakfast with the family.  We only occasionally visit because of the price. But, their coffee is fantastic stop in every other week to buy a bag."}
{"text":"I am starting to like this place better and better.  It is nothing \"inspired\", but they are competent.  Service is good, but nothing to write home about.  I actually found a new dish that was a little on the \"new wave\" or \"on trend\".  I had the avocado toast with two over medium eggs.  It was good.  The avocado would have used a little inspiration, maybe a bit of cumin, onion and cilantro (that is how I make it at home).  It was just mashed avocado, so I had to add pepper, salt and hot sauce.  Overall, it was good.  My husband decided to have a pick 2 choice, so he had 1/2 a sandwich and 1/2 salad.  He was not so thrilled with his choice.  I love that they send you coupons in the mail every so often so one of the meals can be free. Maybe next time I will take a picture before wolfing down my meal."}
{"text":"Loved it! We had a party of 12 and they were attentive and friendly throughout the meal, even offering us drinks to go. The food was delicious!  We were all very impressed with the service and quality of the food."}
{"text":"This was our first time there, and we really enjoyed it. It was Mother's Day, and busy but our wait was only about 10 minutes for the community table, since there were only two of us . The banana granola pancakes were delicious, no need for syrup. I loved the turkey sausage, and fresh squeezed orange juice. I cannot wait to try lunch next time."}
{"text":"This is a Breakfast ,Lunch place that used to be beyond Great! We really loved coming here many years ago. The same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in. Food was wonderful and so was the service.  Then things started to change. The food was not as good, They changed the menu up.  Then the staff started to change. When you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company. The service and food really went downhill. So we stopped coming here.  Well, lately I have been back 2x's. Things are better. They are trying. But, it is still not the same. However, service is fast again, and they do check on you all the time. Food is working it self back up the hill. Maybe they should fo more organic or something. It is still a good place, just not what it was."}
{"text":"We had Breakfast here while waiting for my Mother-in-law to have surgery. Service was excellent very attentive waitress. The food came very quickly. Nice presentation done to perfection. The Coffee was very good, and I'm a coffee snob . I did not see any indication of the less than very good ratings. Perhaps just caught a bad day . I would recommend for the breakfast meal price was good value."}
{"text":"Loved the Power Wrap!!!  Loaded with Swiss cheese, mushrooms, spinach and eggs!  Fresh fruit on the side tops it off!"}
{"text":"Interesting parking area for this place. They have parallel parking and parking in the back. It's kinda a small area for 2 restaurants to share. First watch is delicious! Their iced coffee is so good! So many good choices! Definitely recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch! Also they have a patio so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"What a refreshing place to enjoy breakfast! I was impressed with the varied menu with some healthy options. A friend and I shared a pot of coffee (the flavored creamers at the table were a nice touch) and each ordered a breakfast item. I had the SoCal breakfast burrito which was full of flavorful chicken, quinoa, egg whites, cheese, avocado, black beans, and kale. The green salsa that came on the side was delicious and it also included cup of fruit in which every piece was ripe and fresh! No bland honeydew or soggy grapes! My friend enjoyed the bacon avocado omelette with potatoes and said it was awesome. We both loved the food, service, and atmosphere. There are so many more items that I look forward to trying!   One thing we noted was that when we left, we felt full, but not overstuffed and uncomfortable like when eating greasier breakfast fare elsewhere. I look forward to trying some of the fresh pressed juices, too."}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff: check. Good food: check. Entire pot of coffee: check. Huge bowl of creamers given when you ask for more: check. A name that sounds vaguely like a castle along The Wall: check."}
{"text":"The French toast might be the best I've ever tried. No syrup needed. The breakfast tacos were good, and of course most menu items come with avacado, which is always a good thing"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week. We happen to get there not realizing they were about to close in 30 minutes. However the waitress said us anyway and was beyond helpful and sweet the entire time never felt rushed. The food was amazing!The entire staff with nice very attentive. I tried a little of what my whole family ordered and every dish was perfect. Will definitely be coming back here again soon"}
{"text":"First Off... This place Rocks!!! Order the Chicken Chimichurri or Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash! You will not regret it! Delicious fare and Britney the manager was awesome!!! Weekends are busy, so rise and shine and get to first watch on your next visit to Carefree, Arizona!!! Oh, yeah, and it's on Carefree Highway... So, Slipaway, Slipaway on Me!"}
{"text":"This is was my first time here and I really enjoyed it! I would definitely come back. The environment was really neat and farmhouse look. Pretty big space too"}
{"text":"It's a great place for breakfast solid 3 stars. It's nice to have someplace new in the area! The waitress wasn't overly nice, and really rushed us expecting us to have our order ready as soon as we sat down. Came back 2 minutes later waiting for us to place the order. Not sure why since the place wasn't very busy at all. The food was great! We ordered the million dollar bacon which was basically just bacon with syrup on it lol too pricy for what it was, but it was pretty yummy! I had the lemon pancakes with ricotta cheese and strawberries! It was so good! I'm still craving it now. See photos for more information."}
{"text":"I ate here three days in a row. I have had a variety of their menu options. Their pancakes are delicious but not as good as some places such as \"The Original House of Pancakes.\" Their pancakes are something different and come with a variety of fillings (blueberry, etc). The syrup jar is brought to your table warm, yes warm, so it flows easier and their is not sharp contrast with the temperature of the pancakes. They pancakes and toast come with a jam cup (like ones used for ketchup).The toast here is awesome and I highly recommend it. They have a dish call avocado toast that is quite filling with it but I enjoyed it most on the side with butter and jam. They have a bacon speciality you can get with standard breakfast orders or order it on the side. The eggs and potatoes are good but not great, although I have not had a full omelet. They have a juice bar so oj, grapefruit, apple, and other juices are offered at 3 to 5 dollars.  The location is surrounded by hotels whom I assume are their main customers. Parking looks bad but if you are staying at a hotel it isn't a bother.   Cons are that like most places that are good it gets busy and crowded.   The service is five star in friendliness and I must recommend Lee-ann (forgive the spelling she didn't have a name tag).  The ambiance is kid friendly with a but of rustic charm.   Price - as breakfast places go it is on par with the better and higher end with most stuff between $8 to $12 per person total.  Quality is also high end with their juices, pancakes, and bacon. Delicious.    This is a great place to stop if you are passing through Phoenix and want a high quality breakfast. I will eat here again if it is convenient."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several of these restaurants and it is always excellent.   It's on the healthier option side but done let that deter you.   The pancakes and avocado toast is yum!!!"}
{"text":"I've taken my family to First Watch before, and enjoyed the food but had less than stellar service. I have no plans to return after this morning. The waitress seemed angry, and I know it was busy, but I don't need to feel your resentment that you are irritated by my request for milk for my coffee, as I don't like the creamers you offer. After ordering, we had no refill on coffee, no one to ask for water. My son requested no pecans, and had to send that back. No apology- just a irritated \"I'll get another\".  When asked how my meal was when I was paying the bill, I explained I understood it was busy, but our service ruined the meal. They had the opportunity to say, hey sorry, but it was obviously the woman I spoke to could really care less.  Disappointed and I will be taking my business elsewhere.  If it means anything, I have never written a negative review in my 48 years. So, this means something."}
{"text":"Faboulous food and service, the eggs Benedict was delicious. I think we found our next breakfast, lunch spot."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Phoenix, so I was looking for a good breakfast place to eat at. I saw that the First Watch had great reviews on Yelp. I go there on. Sunday morning around 9:30am, and we were seated right away. I ordered the Bacado (bacon and avacado omelette), my four year old son ordered the kid's meal pancakes, and my husband ordered the fruit and yogurt parfait. All of us loved our meals. My husband said the granola was delicious because it was homemade, so we purchased a bag of granola from them.   Excellent customer service too! I love going to a restaurant with good customer service!   Thank you First Watch for the great experience!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Easy to find. The waitress was very helpful, kind, full of energy and great customer service which was great.    I didn't know what I felt like eating so she was kind enough to tell me what the most ordered as well as best tasting meals where. She was very descriptive. Food arrived within 10-15 mins and everything was fresh and wonderful. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for my first visit. Turns out it's located in Terravita Market Place, my old stomping grounds. I'm seated next to a party of twelve ladies who are having the time of their life...talking, LAUGHING, drinking coffee, etc.   My blueberry muffin was AWESOME. Unfortunately I didn't have time to order a full breakfast...  TERRIFIC PLACE...I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've heard so many rave reviews of this place that's it's difficult to clear them from my brain.  I just wasn't that wowed by First Watch I guess.  THE UP-SIDE:  The food is decent.  There is absolutely nothing unique or interesting about it.  It's standard diner breakfast stuff.  The staff seems pleasant and the place is big, with lots of room to stretch out and breathe.    THE DOWN-SIDE:  Ok, I'm biased.  They advertise having a \"gluten-free menu.\"  They don't.    What they have is a crummy xeroxed listing of what is and isn't gluten-free on their regular menu.  I'm not a dumb man, but I found the process of comparing the list with every item to be monotonous and confusing.  And, while this place is big on breakfast, they do NOT offer gluten-free bread.  So, cut out french toast, toast, and all the sandwiches that you might order.  This isn't a gluten-free menu - it's a lame attempt to say, \"Hey!  You can eat gluten-free here, if you're willing to do all the work to figure it out and have almost no choices!\"  Ultimately, I went with sausage, an OJ, and a fruit parfait.  It wasn't satisfying at all.  It tasted good, but no great shakes whatsoever.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  First Watch is a decent place.  It's very popular, which - given their decidedly average offerings - is a bit confusing.  So, it's not a bad place to eat with the fam, but don't expect anything to justify the hype."}
{"text":"Ehh. Your typical new yuppie place with ehh food and ehh service so they get a lucky 3 stars. Probably more of a 2 star restaurant than 3 but I'm in a giving mood today. We've yet to have stellar or even close to stellar service here. The yuppie suburbanites love these upscale overpriced mediocre places. Fancy menus and all to dazzle the money throwing BMW driving burbers."}
{"text":"Fun place for breakfast if you want to avoid the long lines and the wait time at snooze.  A lot of healthy options for breakfast and the bushes are fairly big so if you want to start the morning on the light side you could just split a portion with someone.  The avocado sandwich or the avocado toast and the power wrap a run of my favorites.  Parking is a bit of an issue here and sometimes they could end up costing you a ticket so searching for parking is the major issue when coming to this location"}
{"text":"Love the morning meditation juice and the lemon pancakes! My husband had the crab omlete. And we shared. The staff was friendly. Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"5 stars for our awesome waitress Ellen.  She was very sweet,  and attentive.  4 stars for the food because it was really good,  but my food  was not cooked the way I asked.  3 stars for low staff, and long wait to be seated/pay"}
{"text":"Yet another favorite of mine! It was The Good Egg prior and it's now First Watch. Very relaxing atmosphere with a staff that's warm & friendly. They have a variety of selections on the menu in which are priced fair and taste great. Great place to go with family, friends as or even by yourself!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was horrible. Pancakes were dry and fell apart when you cut into them. Need a glass of water with every bite."}
{"text":"Awesomely good and well prepared food.  Came here on a whim and dragged my wife, who was skeptical, along with me.  We were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  And the service was on point as well!   Thanks for a great 7 year Anniversary Breakfast."}
{"text":"i mean, it's just average. lots of old people. lots of regulars.  i wish i could give 5 stars solely for our waitress. in fact, i'm going to write the manager to tell them about our awesome waitress. seriously, who cares about the food. i want to be her bff4l, she was so damn nice. apparently everyone loves her bc the regular oldies were hugging her and she knew them all by name. i have NEVER had such a great waitress. for sure, the best, ever.   the food was neither here nor there...just typical breakfast stuff... but i would go back just to hang out with my new bff4l. i wish i knew her name, but if you go here just ask for the blonde girl that everyone loves, you will love her too. and you will also want to be her bff4l."}
{"text":"Creative menu delivered with enthusiasm  We were a party of 5 with a spry 97 year old, and they accommodated our request for a round table that required them to clean a recently used table. Victoria was our server and I can not say enough about her. We had lots of what could be termed irritating requests like extra plates, more butter, warm syrup, new coffees because our got cool and she filled them quickly and happily. I particularly like the check which is broken down by each of our group, so it is understandable and checkable. As far as the food, the waffles, bacon, pancakes, Chicken Chimichurri Hash with 2 eggs basted (a hard request for many cooks) Lemon Ricotta Pancakes all were done exactly as the menu explained them and in a relatively fast delivery time. Victoria did everything like it was no effort....a real GEM BTW I am a restaurant consultant and easily find fault...congrats First Watch"}
{"text":"Great selection of food for the family. The chocolate pancakes for the kids are huge! My daughters love them. I personally get either the salmon eggs benedict or the parma skillet. Employees are cheerful and helpful."}
{"text":"WARNING: This restaurant remarkably brings together the rare combination of disrespectful and rude service with sub-par food.  One waitress in particular at this establishment was extremely rude to my wife and I.  Without boring you with the details I can affirmatively state that never in my life had I been disrespected by waitstaff, let alone to the extent this woman disrespected my entire family.  The lone saving grace is that her behavior occurred prior to ordering food and so we were able to leave before we spent money.  Moreover, I had been to this restaurant in the past on a number of occasions and always found the food to be underwhelming and overpriced.  Needless to say, we will NOT be going back here especially where there are great options nearby such as Eggstacy, Butters, and Hash Kitchen.  You can thank me in advance for choosing to spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was so much better as the good egg. Food is cold. This is the second time my food was cold. Waitress was nice. But the older staff went out of their way to help. Always asked if you wanted a coffee to go not now. Go back to your old ways quick."}
{"text":"Great food. No alcohol so that might deter some people who are looking to get their morning drink on. Also the wait time can be a tad bit long but well worth it. My advice - Use Yelp to check in and get some one knocked off your wait time. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Weekends typically mean a mountain bike ride or road bike ride depending on the day (one of each).  After a couple of hours on a bike, I'm usually not in the mood to cook and weekends are kind of made for brunch anyway!  The P(rincess) and I used to drive down to the First Watch around Dunlap and I-17 but it was kind of a haul so we didn't make it but a couple of times a year. That all changed with the opening of this location minutes from home.  Hearty food without the heaviness you'll find at a Dennys or Waffle House (although those are fine restaurants in what they offer).  I've never had a bad meal at First Watch, the service is quick, efficient, and pleasant.  What to try?  I typically go back and forth between the chickichanga (sic) or the everything omelet. The sides are the wonderful house potatoes or the dressed greens with the lemon dressing (trying hard to duplicate it at home- and getting close :).  They also do a nice job with seasonal offerings. Earlier this summer it was shrimp and grits and while I'm embarrassed to admit it, I'd never had grits.  Loved the meal! (Had it twice).  Their toast is something special too, definitely worth asking for!  They also use a Yelp app that will use SMS texting to let you know when your table is ready, so you can enjoy the free coffee on the patio while chatting with the other customers.  Love the food and the vibe here, glad it's close to home!"}
{"text":"I've given this place too many chances and it falls short each time. I've noticed each time we go, every person who orders has to make some sort of substitution to the menu... that's because their menu choices are just slightly bizarre. And every time we go, someone, if not multiple people at my table, have their orders come out wrong. They allow you to do greens or potatoes, for example, and this morning, 2 of the 5 people at our table received the wrong side. Another reviewer said it perfectly about the coffee too... it totally tastes like something from Denny's or Ihop, but you'll pay a lot more for it at First watch. Finally, we have to ask for water, we have to ask for water refills, I needed to ask 3 times for an extra plate for my child (we informed the waitress when ordering that we were sharing), etc.  To sum it up...I think this place tries to dress up an otherwise blah experience."}
{"text":"First Watch blew it. After previously accommodating gluten free allergy requests, the waiter in the Tempe restaurant told me they no longer will provide a gluten free tortilla substitute for bread. They have eliminated the corn tortilla. What is the advantage to mixing wheat and corn flour for the tortilla used for some items.  On to Matt's Big Breakfast down the street, or N-Counter on Mill or Snooze on College.  They all get it."}
{"text":"It's only three months after my positive review and First Watch has decided sensitivity to its patrons' food allergies is no longer a priority. They now mix wheat flour with gluten free corn flour which they have acknowledged will set off many peoples food allergies. What are you thinking First Watch?"}
{"text":"If you have a food allergy, this is not the place for you. On Saturday, January 21st, I ordered a Bacado omelette at the Mesa restaurant. Since I have a gluten allergy, I requested a gluten free substitute for the toast, preferably a corn taco. Seemed like a reasonable request, however the waitress advised me the taco would cost $2.00 extra. She confirmed this with Eric in the kitchen. I substituted the free fruit cup which I had no intention of eating. What's the matter with First Watch? Apparently only healthy people are welcome."}
{"text":"Deserves five stars so I'm adding in my two cents. It was a bit crowded but isn't that a good sign of a great place to eat? The vibe was awesome, along with the decor. Customer service was also on point. Not only was our server in a great mood and super helpful, but if we needed something when she was busy with another table, anyone who could was happy to help. Food was also delicious. I ordered one of their healthier burritos and enjoyed it. It was a little overloaded with cheese for a healthy burrito but if I had read the menu thoroughly I would of been more prepped. Great variety on the menu and seriously delicious food."}
{"text":"I live in an area that doesn't have First Watch. I used to live in Florida and eat First Watch all the time 16 years ago. What happened to the Turkey Dill? Lol. Maybe you got rid of it 13 years ago?  Anyway... Service was great, place was clean, and my breakfast dish was fresh and tasty. My only disappointment was the pancake. It's pretty bad.  It didn't taste good.  But! Good news! You don't have to order the pancakes. Get the French Toast! I will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Croque madame and chickichanga were our breakfast choices.  The croque was two layers brioche with ham and gruyere in between topped with sunny side up eggs and bechamel.    Sounded great... but the bechamel had the consistency and flavor of elementary school library paste (of course I tasted it as a child), the eggs were oddly over-and under-cooked at the same time (grill too hot with no cover to steam yolks?) and the bread to other ratio was way too high.     The chickichanga (a tortilla with eggs, chicken, chorizo, avocado and cheese rolled inside) was supposed to be topped with Vera Cruz sauce.  The yellow tasteless liquid on top had none of the ingredients expected in a Vera Cruz sauce and something tasted moldy inside.      Maybe we just made bad menu choices...  but we will never know because there are way too many other great choices in town...  Service was friendly and good so 2 stars not 1."}
{"text":"First watch has changed the game for good! The new menu is out of this world! The food seems like it's about 10X better then the good egg. My food is always so delicious is seems illegal! It is definitely addictive,so make sure you can ford a habit when you try it for the first time. Once you start ,you can't stop it! They cook my food especially the way I like,they actually specialize in specific orders!! It so perfect because they know me,I've had them re cook a couple plates and they did it no question asked. I can be a bit of a stickler when it comes to my food. They are OCD about the specific orders ,believe me. The food is clean is all organic,vegan approved! They do have stuff for that red meet lover to. All the staff is so cool,in a earthy way. The place has a thanksgiving dinner atmosphere with a Christmas sent thru out the dinner. I will be visiting often and recommend ing to everyone! Thanks again so much!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat quality food at an affordable price! Very tentative waitress with a upbeat personality! This place is clean and well maintained. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to have a great breakfast."}
{"text":"2nd time here. It's really good. Everything tastes fresh. I love their omelettes & potatoes. Their iced cappuccino is really good. Their waffles are amazing. They are a breakfast & lunch (brunch) place. Feels like a healthy place to eat and it tastes super good. Definitely will still be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here! I was blown away by the service ( I wish I remembered her name - she's 29 with 2 kids - short blonde hair!) and food! Best breakfast I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought for sure I'd be ordering avocado toast if it was a menu item...and it was...but so many other things sounded fantastic, too! The server helped me narrow it down and was very helpful about the menu overall. I ended up ordering the Farmhouse Skillet that included fresh tomatoes, onions, avocado, and crispy potatoes with eggs. It was served with a side of fruit & toast. The coffee was rich and served at a great temperature, the setting was awesome, and the Lenny Kravitz music was a bonus for this lady! They split my plate in 2 for me in the kitchen so I could easily keep my calories in check and take half home. Super fresh and tasty ingredients and the quality was obvious. Great meal!"}
{"text":"I met my mother and father for breakfast on Mother's Day.  I would have preferred Maria's Scrambler, but this was my \"mothers\" day, so I succumbed.  I ordered eggs benedict.  The server was pleasant and breakfast was served in a timely manner considering how crowded it was.  When I went to cut into my food, I encountered a black hair, not a short one, but a LONG one.  My appetite was immediately ruined but I considered eating the breakfast anyway hoping I could get past the hair, as I was starving.  This time I put on my glasses to get a better look.  As I went to cut into the food again, I encountered a second black hair, this one even longer than the first, that was it, I was done.  I alerted the server and asked her why their cooks did not wear hair nets and how this could possibly happen.  She informed me that they \"tie\" their hair back and wear hats, well not good enough if I'm finding two long hairs in my food.  What, did this girl do, comb her hair whilst standing over my food?  Disgusting.  I then just ordered the safest thing I could think of that didn't entail sauces and I could visibly see the food.  She was kind enough to remove the price of the meal from the bill but still charged for my drink.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to First Watch for breakfast, lunch or dinner, ever.  Thanks for the hair."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast.  Eggs came out cold.  Chef made a lame excuse, and when our hot eggs came out, there was a hair in our food.  Clearly, whoever is running/managing this place these days is not interested in creating an amazing breakfast experience.  After all, how do you really screw up eggs?  When we told the person at checkout about our experience, his comment was, \"that's not fun\".  This restaurant is very close to our home, but I'm sorry to say that we won't be back."}
{"text":"Walk in and feel at home in the farmhouse modern atmosphere.  Start with a nice big cup of freshly brewed coffee and some refreshing water poured from a mason jar.  The biscuits and gravy with turkey sausage was bursting with pepper flavor and was incredibly creamy.  The biscuit was flaky and perfectly cooked. My BLT eggs Benedict had the perfect amount of hollandaise sauce, and with just a hint more bacon could have been PERFECT. The kids meals are very generous and come with a drink.  Prices are just a touch high but not too bad.  Overall a wonderful place with a welcoming atmosphere that I would visit again."}
{"text":"This place is busy enough, so it must be doing something right. That thing may not be the waffles or pancakes, however. My sister sent her Belgian waffle back because it was too greasy and she couldn't eat it. They brought a pancake instead, but she didn't like that either.  I ordered the Avacado toast which was satisfying. Great multigrain bread and a huge portion of avocado. It was served with two eggs. My mom liked her omelet. My partner also had a waffle. He finished his but says it was nothing like a Belgian waffle. I'd say go, but steer clear of the pancakes and waffles."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our first experience at First Watch Matthews!! We didn't realize how long of a wait it would be on a rainy Saturday morning and were a bit bummed when we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Luckily, our wait time was only 25 minutes long! We loved the design of the restaurant, the fact that all your food is so fresh with no heat lamps, and the impeccable service. Very impressed with the menu and everything we ordered was delicious! Took advantage of the Sun-E-Club to get buy one get one free entrees. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time at First Watch exceeded my expectations. Had to wait a bit before getting seated, which was no big deal for two reasons 1. When places have a wait or a line, you KNOW it's good and 2. I had great company to pass the time. Score!   Once we got seated, Cassie came over and was absolutely phenomenal! She recommended a bunch of items on the menu, and although all the items sounded mouth-wateringly delicious and amazing, I opted to get The Elevated Egg Sammy -- with a side of Pumpkin Pancakes. Super yum!   Food came out fairly quickly (although I'm not sure how long it really was -- I was too caught up in great conversation), and Cassie was so incredibly on point, coming to check on us, refilling water, letting us know our food was almost ready. ***Special \"Thanks\" to Cassie, btw! She definitely made the experience so much better, such a beautiful girl with an amazing personality, kind, caring, and she went above and beyond and truly took care of us... Thank you again, Cassie! You rock!!!***  Now on to the food: the presentation made the food so appetizing! I love that the chefs here actually take pride in the way they send the food out, not just slap things on a plate. My Elevated Egg Sammy -- wow! I pretty much inhaled it. The flavor was absolutely mouth-watering and satisfying bite after bite. And the country-style potatoes... goodness, they tasted like grandma just made you the most amazing, tasty home-made potatoes on an old-school cast iron skillet (let's face it guys, grandmas are the BEST cooks ever!) I highly recommend getting this breakfast sandwich; you won't be sorry, and your tastebuds will jump for joy with excitement.  The Pumpkin Pancakes... Simply decadent! I ordered two (you can choose one, two, or three) light and pillow-like fluffy pancakes. They had the perfect amount of pumpkin flavor, not too overbearing or in your face pumpkiny-ness. Super yummy! I ate half of them (can you tell I was hungry) and then brought the rest home... Cuz pancakes for dinner? Yes, please!   Overall I had an incredible experience at First Watch; wasn't too fond of the place it was before, though. But now that I know how amazing, fresh, and yummy the food is here, I'll be back to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I went with a friend and we both loved our meals. I got the ham cheese and tomato melt with seasoned potatoes and my friend had the Lemon picatta pancakes. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for a quick bite to eat. I've driven past this location several times, but today was my first time actually trying it out.  First and foremost, the staff here is so lovely! Even though it was quite busy when we arrived, our waitress was so patient and calm. She took the time to go through some of the most popular menu items.  I ordered the parm skillet hash and geez. So. Much. Food. I couldn't finish all of it and had to get a box. It was delicious! I loved the way the dish was presented, I loved how the potatoes we cooked and seasoned. And whatever they put on the toast... yum!  Im definitely going to have to come back. They've got tons of things I want to try. I'm especially excited to try out all their seasonal drinks!  As for parking, definitely not an issue!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Lemon Blueberry Quinoa Pancakes! Seriously this is the best breakfast I have had for a very long time. Our server, Joanne was incredibly attentive and happy.  Great food, super service and love the new urban decor"}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but First Watch is one of the exceptions.  I've been to both the Robinson and Bridgeville locations, and what stood out at the Bridgeville location was the level of service we received.  Four of us enjoyed breakfast there on Saturday, February 11, 2017.  I wish I recalled the name of our server, because he was great.  A couple people in our group requested alterations to their orders, and he was sure to make sure that they were exactly what was requested when they arrived at our table.  He also did not rush us and was the perfect level of attentive (especially given that the restaurant was so busy).  The restaurant also offers healthy options, which was great.  They don't take reservations and can get quite busy, so be sure to check in in advance through the No Wait app."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fruity Chicken Salad and my husband got the special.  He was happy with his meal, I wasn't so much.    Don't get me wrong- it was good- just not what I expected.  I was expecting a salad with some fruit thrown in.  What I got was fruit with a couple of spinach leaves under it.  I didn't even use the dressing... there was not point.  My husbands meal looked awesome though.  I think I'll come here again and try something else- probably breakfast."}
{"text":"Their avocado toast is to die for! Service was amazing and super friendly. Highly suggest this place if you are wanting a good healthy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great service and great breakfast.  Highly recommended!  I had the farmhouse hash and my wife had the breakfast tacos.  Both made from scratch and extremely delicious.   The decor was very cool and waitress very friendly.  Go here for fresh homemade meals."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch or heck, even brunch! Especially brunch... for a lunch treat, get the Monterrey Club - you will not be upset that you joined that club!"}
{"text":"First Watch is really the best spot in the area for breakfast.  I've never had a wait on a weekday. The service is quick-- actually, it's instantaneous! There's never a wait for more coffee as they give you your own thermos of quality coffee! I've not been adventuresome with the menu, sticking always to their reliable \"Traditional\" breakfast, going with the sausage links. If you too rebel against the all-too commonplace and tasteless Sysco \"sausage\" patties, you'll love these delicious sausages. They cook them perfectly at First Watch. You'll have plenty of room in their booths whether you're dining alone with your work-papers all spread out, or sitting with others. Noise level is perfect for having a meeting over a meal. First Watch servers are first-rate pros, a perfect balance of down-to-business attention accompanied by a friendly smile but without the overlay of fake and distracting, cutesy chitchat.  Everything in the place is clean; the whole operation is well-organized and everything I've ordered has been delicious. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I always use Yelp when traveling to find great places to eat. This place lived up to its review. Great service. Loved the call ahead option which I highly recommend because the place is very busy. I had the veggie omelette which was delicious. I have to say though I think my favorite thing was the multi grain bread with the strawberry preserves."}
{"text":"Pretty average. I had the pot roast hash with eggs and it was nothing more than pot roast without the carrots and 2 eggs on top.  Wife had the Tri athlete. Sorta dry, nothing special.   Multi grain bread was delicious, coffee was just ok. Service was slow.   I'm gonna look for a good old fashioned Greek diner next time."}
{"text":"This specific location has a great ambience for bigger gatherings. Love the outdoor patio as well just sucks that we are in the Arizona heat. The food was great! The way this place made their scrambled eggs was completely different than most breakfast places. However, I felt the customer service from the waiters/waitresses was very bland and just not that good. Yea it was the typical \"how are you\" and \"what can I get you?\". Nothing to special about the service when I went. I think the design and decor of the place made it great."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my parents and it was a very enjoyable experience. I really liked this cool little breakfast place and will definitely be coming back! It was really delicious with a ton of healthy options! In a world filled with chain breakfast places, this is really a shining star and a great place to start the morning. Our waitress was wonderful, she even pointed out a better bang for our buck option on the menu we had overlooked. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mediocre review for a mediocre meal. Womp Womp Womp  Alright its not all bad. The restaurant is quite large, its always buzzing with happy families and their menu is extensive. My 3 stars are for very slow service and a meal lacking any flavor. I ordered the \"tri-athlete\" breakfast: egg white veggie omelet (usually with salsa on top), side of cottage cheese and a toasted english muffin. Despite what some people may think, there is no reason why healthy meals can't be packed with flavor. Yes, even without the bacon (gasp!).  The omelet was cooked decently but it didn't have any seasoning to it. Basically I struggle to rave about because I can replicate and exceed it at home. Now, my friends enjoyed their breakfast- especially the pumpkin pancakes (a specialty during the Fall only). Our server took enough time to come and refill coffee and take our orders that we often had to hunt her down so we could finish our breakfast in under 2 hours.   I'm sorry this review lacks wittiness, charm or good writing. Its mediocre, kinda like First Watch. Yikes."}
{"text":"This is where the Good Egg used to be.    Walked in and it had the currently hip breakfast place look and feel (which is fine, because I kind of like it).  The community table just a little ways inside looked like a good place to grab a bite and maybe strike up a conversation with some new folks.  I ordered the classic Eggs Benedict - came with a salad.  That was new.  It was lunchtime, so I figured I'd be good and eat my greens.  The salad was very (a little too) lightly dressed.  The part that had dressing was pretty tasty.    The Eggs Benedict was really good, too.  My office compadre got one of the skillets - he said it was really good also. We'd just made coffee (V60 pourover!) before we left the office, so I can't report on the coffee.  Service was very good.  All in all, well worth coming back and trying some other menu items sometime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice to this same location. The first time I wasn't impressed and would probably give it three stars at the time. I came again last week and ordered the market hash... oh my god it is the best thing ever. SO SO FLAVORFUL. MUST HAVE... GO...NOW!   Anyway, they have a decent menu, something for everyone. Whether you are a health nut or someone who just does not give a _____, you will find something you like.   Service here is great, they can get busy but they do not neglect you. Everyone is friendly. Prices are fair and portions are filling."}
{"text":"Loved the Rainbow Toast - it was amazing with the Diced Mango.  The place was packed on a Tuesday morning and the service was awesome.  There are a lot of menu options"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Our server Brie, was fun knowledgeable and prompt. Atmosphere was fun, industrial meets country shiek. Food yummy. Try the tasty juices."}
{"text":"WiFi. NEVER WORKS!! If your planning on studying, going over documents , or anything while enjoying your meal... GOOD LUCK WITH THAT"}
{"text":"This place was very busy but was WORTH the wait!  The food was excellent.  I got the veggie omelette and everything was fresh.  Was that roasted peppers I saw?  What?  The grits were amazing!  I suggest to call ahead to get in line and beat the crowds.  I will be back to try lunch.  Highly recommend First Watch!"}
{"text":"Look I'll be honest, my first impressions of this place were positive. But the food prices + poor temperature food + lack of portion size + under seasoned  soggy potatoes + non-crispy sausage took my 4 star impression and chopped it in half. I was really hoping this place would be a steal for me, but I was wrong."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 7 years now and I love it. It's not that great decor but the food is great and they offer brunch until 3. I love the hash I think it's a amazing. Otherwise they have a big menu and it's all good. The food comes out fast too so if you're looking for a quick dine in then you gotta come here ."}
{"text":"I ordered the pumpkin oatmeal with a side of bacon. I appreciated that the server was able to do some minor modifications to my meal (biscuit instead of muffin). The biscuit was soft and tasty, the bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sadly, there was so much spice in the pumpkin oatmeal that it was inedible.  2 for the oatmeal, 5 for the biscuit and bacon... we will average it at 3. I'd be willing to try eating here again    Second trip my husband had the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were good but not as good as we anticipated. The bacon egg sandwich was good but made wrong. Unfortunately, the service was severely lacking. My food didn't arrive until my husband was almost finished with his pancakes (I told him to eat so it would not get cold), there wasn't any refills on tea or checking in to see how we were doing.   We won't seek this restaurant out again, but would agree to meet a friend there if they requested it."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious with plenty of options for healthy eating and not so healthy if that's your way :) the kids meals are huge and tasty and always come with a big bowl of fruit. I love that they take the time for the kid's food as well as the parents, it's always such an afterthought at other restaurants.  Prices are reasonable and the fresh juice is amazing!  My only complaint is the both seating always has a broken support in it and is not comfortable at all!"}
{"text":"Kitchen was super fast. Service a little slow but it was a busy Saturday morning. Love it- best chain in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very healthy options and wonderful juice selection. Overall a great experience. A little pricey but totally worth it. Avocado toast was amazing my eggs were cooked perfectly. Love this place!!! $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Go there just about every Sunday morning for breakfast. Quality food and nice servers. Get there early or prepare to wait awhile."}
{"text":"Food was excellent- avocado  toast was loaded with avocados and the portion size is large! Service is so good and they really are service oriented!"}
{"text":"I've never had such consistently bad service anywhere but here. The wait staff always takes 10-20 minutes just to acknowledge my table. My food has definitely sat in the kitchen longer than necessary and comes out cold every time. Today we sat outside and as usual no one acknowledged us for 15 MINUTES! People were bussing tables around us...no acknowledgement. Waitress helps another table...no acknowledgement. We decided to leave and as we're walking out the waiter servicing that area asked how everything was. Seriously!? We mentioned that no came over and his response was \"well I can help you now.\"  Wow! Never giving this place another chance!"}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta pancakes are wonderful. Just a hint of lemon. Waffles are light and airy."}
{"text":"I know this is a late post...  My sister and I took my mom here for Mother's Day because she wanted to go somewhere close to her house...I felt that I would have received better service going across the street to Denny's.   The waitress forced me to order a dish that I did not want. My mom had ordered French toast and she wanted the fruit on the side. The waitress brought out a waffle with the fruit on the side. When we sent it back, the French toast came out with the fruit on top instead of on the side like we asked. After having so many issues, the manager did not even come to our table to acknowledge or apologize for the issues that came up causing us to send a dish back.   By the end of our breakfast, we concluded that we probably would have had a better experience at Denny's. It is safe to say we will never come back to First Watch, I am definitely sad that The Good Egg is no more."}
{"text":"The cranberry location is better. My food came out cold the last time I was there and the food isn't prepared as well. I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened because I really love the cranberry location."}
{"text":"I like them best for those potatoes, don't go close to closing they'll give burned hard potatoes that were reheated, for breakfast or lunch those potatoes are on point! My favorite location is the one near the US Airways center"}
{"text":"Great place to have a nice breakfast, brunch or lunch. What's even better is there are healthy options like steel cut oats as well as splurging in Belgium waffles. We opted for salad as we were for lunch very clean and pleasant place."}
{"text":"I ordered the superfood kale salad with chicken. Server brought out our food and placed a salad with mixed greens in front of me. I thought there might have been a mix up or something but was told that the superfood kale salad is actually a mixed green salad with some bits of kale mixed in. Enter my big frown. I picked through my salad and managed to find a few tiny tendrils of kale. I dunno, I guess with a name like \"superfood kale salad\" I kinda expected to be eating kale. Crazy. To our server's credit, she immediately offered to bring out a bowl with more kale or to remake the entire salad with only kale. I appreciate our server's quick response and wanting to make me happy.  The salad was tasty, but come on, the restaurant really needs to call the salad what it is"}
{"text":"We come in for breakfast quite a bit here as it's one of our favorite spots! Service is always really friendly and great but today we had a new server, Kayla, who was absolutely amazing!!!! She was so attentive and sweet and funny. She did above and beyond, especially because we did come in with some pretty modified orders! Only thing - too much kale in the Fritatta Rustica but we love the food and service here so much! Thank you Kayla for being so great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good good. Better than the standard Denny's breakfast everyone else serves."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! Absolutely different with any other restaurant. Love the food quality and if you want a bigger portion for the normal price this is the place to go. Check it out one of these days if you are hunting a good breakfast/brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"It was just OK. The skillet was pretty small for the price compared to other breakfast places, and the orange juice had a strong (and gross) aftertaste that reminded me of the wheat grass shots from Jamba Juice. I asked for an English muffin with my skillet but the whole grain toast was packed inside my to go bag instead.   I probably won't be back unless the whole office decides to try the lunch menu.   The servers were pleasant though. :)"}
{"text":"We have gone for breakfast after soccer games several times but this was our first trying out this place. Food is excellent and I think this will be our after soccer breakfast spot from now on. It's right next to the soccer fields at snedigar and it's got a great feel to it and the food and service are great."}
{"text":"Originally I was very disappointed in First Watch so the manager reached out and asking if I would please consider them again. It was so much better this time. Our server Jorden was beyond amazing. The food was excellent and served promptly and hot. Our waiter explained that a big group came at the same time and it might be a few minutes. However she was so attentive to us we did not notice a wait. She was that way with all her tables. She appeared to really enjoy her job. My friend had menu questions and she was so knowledgeable.  I saw the person who waited on us before. That was possibly have been a huge part of the problem. I noticed she rarely had a genuine smile or perk in her step. She was just 'doing her job' would I go back. I say yes. Thank you management for reaching out."}
{"text":"Ordered a Croque Madame off the seasonal menu, such a disappointment!  That's a first, but that's how it goes sometimes. This sandwich needs help.  The bread, while nicely toasted, was way to thick for the ingredients.  First Watch has wonderful ham, which could barely be found, or tasted.  The gruyere cheese was all but invisible, and could not be tasted.  The béchamel sauce was so skimpy I was obliged to ask for more, and I am not a sauce person.  The additional béchamel did help a bit.  The best part of this sandwich was 2 perfectly prepared over easy eggs.  Additionally, this sandwich comes with no accompaniment of any sort, no fruit, mixed greens or potatoes, just very thick bread and a jumble of ingredients.  Service, as usual, was good - hence the 2 star rating."}
{"text":"I came to this place with an open mind but left kinda disappointed.  I like my breakfast to taste fresh and healthy and I don't feel like I got that here. I got a spinach wrap and it was just okay! I wasn't in love, I didn't finish it. I got a kale juice which was good, just wish they would have asked if I wanted it with ice... I got more ice then I did juice."}
{"text":"We didn't catch the name of our server but she was extremely kind and did her job very well. The food was amazing as usual, I had never been to this location before but it was so cozy and nice!! A+"}
{"text":"Service still under par. Never got a drink refill. Ok last try and this time the service was even worse. It took 45 min to get our foof and another 30 min waiting on the check. We are done with this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars only because my server was slow. My family members loved the food. My muffin was cold which I did ask to be warmed up. The coffee was really good. Other than that when I do eat it's nice to get water at the beginning of my meal and not at the end.   Visiting from Henderson,NV"}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit after they became First Watch from the Good Egg. I like the fact that they have an app that allows you to get on the wait list before you get there (really helped us on a Sunday after church). Upon arrival, there was a line with a 17 min wait but due to the fact we pre registered we were seated right away.   We had a very polite young man by the name of Ian as our waiter. Water and drinks were brought within minutes. We asked questions about the trifecta and the traditional. Ian advised which was better since we both love waffles.  We ordered the trifecta, one with ham and the other with bacon. Two different eggs servings.  We were served within 10 minutes even though the place was very busy.   Pro's:  Both servings of eggs done just right. Waffle is very good with the spiced butter. Ham had a small hickory flavor, good!  Nice portion. Not too big and not too small.   Con's:  Syrup could have been warmer. Watch your timer on poached eggs. Bacon was a little too salty. Water glasses too small and no ice when served.   Will be back to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Out of all the times I've been AZ (not to mention living there) I'd never even heard of this place or been taken here (yay for visiting and parents wanting to feed you)!  Everything is fresh and healthy and being that was I going for vegetarian at the time I had plenty of options. After a pain-staking decision I went for the Veg'd Out. AMAZING. I practically licked my plate. (Luckily my parents raised me better than that. In public at least).   The service was friendly and most efficient and the food was delicious; definitely an improvement over the usual breakfast places I generally get dragged to!   Bonus points for the humorous menu..I'm such a sucker for menu's with a sense of humor."}
{"text":"Kianna is the best server!! Had the sausage and mushroom hash with kale tonic. Very good"}
{"text":"We saw it across from our room at the Dobson Ranch Ramada.  We walked across the street into a little piece of heaven!  Greeted kindly upon entering, taken to our table right away.  Server was excellent!  Coffee is absolutely superb!  Wonderful menu options.  I had \"The Works\" omelette!  Awesome is all I can say!  A nice find with a few more locations in the Valley!  Try them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We go here every few weeks.  Always a wait 20 minutes avg before getting a table.  We love the food and atmosphere. Decorated so cool.  Good hot food.  Great choices. Healthy picks of fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables.  Love the healthy drinks. It's loud which bothers some people but it's an active and bustling place.  I highly recommend it.  Take your out of town guest and they'll definitely be impressed."}
{"text":"The food is so good and fresh. We got the avacado toast and bacado. Everything was as good as homemade. Service was fast and no wait even on a Saturday morning at 9:30."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego. I find it hard to find something that serves a good breakfast in Sun City West. Found this place on yelp. Very pleased and would return."}
{"text":"Has a wide variety on the menu but all pretty mediocre food. If you want something fast and are hungry, go here but not if you want a nice brunch experience. I got the salmon eggs Benedict and the salmon didn't taste that fresh and neither did the avocado. Not good sides either. Friendly service though."}
{"text":"Loved our Sunday brunch here. As someone who counts macros and tries to eat very clean, this restaurant was very accommodating and the menu had fantastic healthy options. Everything tasted great and the service was also wonderful. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place looks incredible they completely remodeled. I thought I walked into the wrong place this morning. Service was very friendly as always. Food looks and tastes amazing. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First let me say, we used to eat at this location when it was the Good Egg all the time, so we thought we would give the new place a try,  I wanted the biscuits and gravy, until I saw \"Carrot Cake Pancakes\" on the menu and decided to give them a whirl.  The waiter brought out our food and said, I have good news and bad news, the bad news was, they screwed up my order, the good news was, I was going to get the banana, granola pancakes they made for free and would still receive the pancakes I ordered shortly after.  No down side there.  The banana granola pancakes were pretty good.  Then my choice came out.  It was a pancake, it had shredded carrots and, raisons and nuts in it, but was nothing like the Carrot Cake pancakes I have become accustomed to elsewhere, which actually taste more like carrot cake with a drizzle of cream cheese frosting...these pancakes just had butter.  Now I am sure they are going for \"healthy\" versions of stuff, but don't get my hopes up for a pancake that tastes like Carrot Cake, if I am really getting a regular pancake with some shredded carrots in it.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I go, I will certainly go for the biscuits and gravy and see how that goes...though I see they use turkey instead of pork sausage for those...so they might end up being bland as well.  Time will tell.  Other than that, the place is very homey, service was great, prices not too bad.   I do wish somebody in town would specialize in gourmet pancakes (red velvet, carrot cake, spice cake, cinnamon swirl, german chocolate) etc.etc.etc. other than IHOP who occasionally tries out some new flavors."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow... So the outside of this place was interesting but when you walk in its a whole other world! It's a rustic feel inside with the AC at about 70... We sat down and were greeted with a lovely waitress. It was our first time there so she helped up decide. And wow I was not disappointed I actually was happy because I got the French toast I wanted with 2 eggs and Bacon. It made my morning. The coffee is good. The food amazing! Would definitely come back to try something new!"}
{"text":"The food is healthy and great tasting! Love the menu! However, they need to seriously improve their wait time from 1 hr+ down to 20-30 min. Especially when they have lots if tables available. Also, they need to pay more attention when the customer asks for gluten free items and actually bring the correct items. It would be really nice to see a manager on a Sunday, during the busiest time to help hustle. At least sit as many customers as possible, apologize for the wait, and offer coffee!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times since it is under new ownership. Always found Good Egg consistently good, not great, but consistent. Everything here is still consistent except mostly bad. The service is consistently slow, was taken 10 minutes on three visits to get something to drink. Do they understand they're in the breakfast business? Diners in the old days would bring you coffee before your butt even hit the seat here its sitiing wondering where is my coffee.finally the coffee comes but not much sooner than the entree,  which would obviously has been laying around for that 10 or 15 minutes that you've been waiting for your coffee. The service staff is unprofessional not trained and Clueless. There needs to be some adult supervision .  They're also needs to be food Runners because your service help doesn't understand the concept of getting hot food out to the table in a timely matter. I know it's a complicated business but this seems to be a simple  method of getting people their food when it's hot . Yes you get a nice smile. But that's it. Last visit my meal came out stone cold room temperature. When I finally got the attention of my waitress and told her that I was not happy with my food she asked me what I would like to do. G what do I have to draw you a picture I want a hot freaking meal. Do you really have to ask? Then I had to feel like having justify why I wanted a hot meal. So she took it back and a few minutes later I got a replacement meal that was barely warmer then the first one barely edible in my disgust I ate it and got the hell out of there never to return again. You people are an example of having to be at the right location maybe we'll get some competition at which time you will last five minutes. The food's pretty good when you finally get it if you like wait 10 or 15 minutes for breakfast.  . ."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time on sat morning and it was soo good we went back on Sunday morning I love their food its so healthful compared to other breakfast spots in the area and the prices are comparable!"}
{"text":"Took our grandson to breakfast at First Watch yesterday.  He had the Florida French Toast  Looks so pretty when served. He loved it. My husband always gets the Skillet Hash-farmhouse.  I like,to try different items each time I go. Fried potatoes on my plate were a bit spicy but very good.  I had ordered iced tea. When we were ready to leave our waitress brought me a \"to go\" iced tea without me having to ask for it. Very nice!"}
{"text":"First Watch offers some menu items you won't find at your typical \"Dennys\" style eatery.  Sure they have traditional breakfast items but check out there other healthy and tasty choices.  Avocado toast is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Trumps ;) all other brecky in Tempe. Service has always been great and the space has a cool comfy vibe. Check it out"}
{"text":"Food is almost edible and nothing special. Service was atrocious. Our waiter took three trips back and forth to our table just to get us coffee... yes we need cups to drink that! Had a sprint salad as the side for my eggs Benedict and could t eat most of it because the lettuce had gone bad! Really should have asked for a refund. No flavor in any sauces. SKIP IT!!"}
{"text":"First time here, and will definitely be returning for breakfast! Belgian waffle was amazing. My husband had the bacon avo omelette with toast and fresh jam- delicious!  Great dining room, new decor with a farmhouse feel and great service."}
{"text":"First watch has really great tasting food, but I am time and time again discouraged by the high prices. I ordered the pecan cinnamon waffles one time, and although very tasty- I was left unsatisfied. The portions are small and with a side of coffee my meal total came to about $13. Not incredibly expensive I admit, but more than I was willing to pay for such a meager portions. I did however like the atmosphere of First Watch. I think it's a great place to have brunch (at a cost), and could seat a lot of people at a time."}
{"text":"After working a 18 hour shift me and my co-workers were looking for a spot that sold breakfast all day long. A few people we talked to recommended this place. I really enjoyed the neighborhood feel this place give off as well as the healthy choices they offer on there menu. I had there eggs Benedict which were pretty good. My co-workers really enjoyed there plates as well and ranted about the blueberry panckaes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our simple lunch.  The food is fresh and staff were friendly.  There's tons to choose from for breakfast or lunch.  This is a great location for a small or large group."}
{"text":"First off our server Tasha was wonderful. The food is amazing and I highly recommend the Frittata Rustica with side potatoes. Instead of kale in the meal, I substitute spinach and it was amazing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot, hands down!!  So we decided to try this location. Everything was absolutely fantastic from food to service, except the restaurant was absolutely freezing!!!! To the point another table went and set outside. I had to admit it was tempting. We ate extremely fast to get into the warmth.   If you want a healthy breakfast with different options available, this is your place!!! They even have multiple lunch items. Coffee and specialty drinks are great!"}
{"text":"This place!! I love it! It is so cute! The derive is great I love the food I got the traditional breakfast their potatoes are amazing! Like to die for! So good their sausage links are great too and I love the seed bread they have I haven't tried anything I didn't like and their orange juice is so fresh I definitely will be coming here at least once a week you should definitely try it out!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits ? Who would of thought this would be good ? First watch did , and they nailed it ! This breakfast is a real eye opener ."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and very accommodating to larger parties.  I had the Triathlete and it was more than enough, very flavorful, and great option for a person being mindful of calories.  Love that we had hot coffee right at the table the whole time versus the server allowing the carafe to get cold. Our server was very nice and we will definitely be back soon--I am really wanting to try the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"Most favorite breakfast spot to travel to just for the Avocado Toast with lightly basted eggs! Yum yum!  I like the ambience early on a Saturday morning. They never disappointed us for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best breakfast place in chandler. I love how creative it is while still being healthy and tasting good. I even enjoyed fresh green juice with my so cal burrito. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean!! I have already been back twice since my first experience a week ago!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant replaced the Good Egg in Scottsdale on FLW and Via Linda in the Safeway shopping center.   I will say it is pretty pricey for breakfast/brunch. It's basic food with some sort of healthy/organic-ish spin. It may just be the way the food descriptions are written, because the eggs etc. do come with a pretty good dose of grease.   I usually like oatmeal, filling and pretty healthy depending on how you dress it, but this too with all the frills is just south of $10.00.   I'm never that excited about going here; however, on my last visit ( awhile ago) Shrimp and Grits was one of the featured dishes on the menu. It was outstanding!!!   The grits were not too dry and not too creamy cheese grits, sautéed green and red peppers and onions, spicy andouille sausage a more than a few plump sweet shrimp. I took home the leftovers from the large portion dish and had them for dinner....still delicious. This being from the daughter of a Southern Gentlemen with more than her fair share of eating and cooking traditional Southern Food.  I miss the old crew of servers from the Good Egg (which by the way are across the street at Vito's) who were exceptional. The servers are not as attentive and friendly and have somewhat something to be desired, but for a neighborhood breakfast/ brunch spot it's OK"}
{"text":"Service with snark, how hard is it to scramble eggs?  My eggs were more fried than scrambled."}
{"text":"Same good egg feel, same good egg faces, but NOT the same good egg taste. Not sure if the cafe is trying to make a move towards healthier food but it wasn't as flavorful as before. And way over priced!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. To everyone who says the food is lacking flavor, your taste buds have been destroyed by modern additives to food. The food is AMAZING for anyone who like to eat clean and healthy. Im definetly coming back."}
{"text":"A politically correct restaurant. Fresh food and tasty. Be prepared for a higher than \"normal\" bill. Basic breakfast with small oj and coffee. $42 for 2."}
{"text":"love breakfast. It is my favorite meal of the day. First Watch has terrific pancakes and eggs. If  I am in the mood for breakfast First Watch is always my first choice."}
{"text":"Very healthy, filling brunch options. The coffee is amazing. Pancakes are delicious, Millionaires Bacon is yummy. At first glance you may think it is pricey but you are getting quality food! Seriously....even their juices are prepared morning of!!! They have remodeled and it looks so inviting"}
{"text":"Simple and light but filling meals. Great atmosphere for a meal by yourself or with friends or family. The chocolate chip pancakes that my son got was delicious. I wish they offered it on the regular menu. The price is also decent. For a buck or two more per plate than somewhere like iHop, the difference in quality is worth so much more. Our service was also good. Decent timing and when we asked for water, we got it right away. I'd recommend this place to others and I will go back myself too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  From the service to the food, I can't say enough (about breakfast.  They have a full lunch menu, as well.)  The menu is full of creative, hearty and interesting meals.  I went with the Pork Belly and Grits (Don't forget to look at the big chalk board as it has some items that are not on the menu, where I found the grits)  Holy moly, the grits were cooked perfectly, not too cheesy, just enough and the compliment of the pork belly, with flavor and texture was awesomeness.   Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing.  I will definitely go back  To note:   1.  Coffee pots are on tables which can satisfy any coffee lovers cravings at your own pace. 2.  There is a BOGO coupon online at their website if you sign up for the First Watch club.  HINT:  Do it a day before, not the day of.  Mine arrived almost 24 hours AFTER breakfast.  OH well, technology."}
{"text":"This is my kind of restaurant.  From the full pitcher of water with lemon slices to the end of the meal.  I had the smoked salmon special, it was excellent.  The dressed greens were so good.  Just plain greens with dressing and it was so good. The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this place and have been here three times. The first time, awesome! Ham and gruyere melt - delicious. Kale tonic - wonderful. Even good and efficient service. The second time, after being seated, it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server and the food wasn't quite as memorable. This morning, my third visit, was not good. That same, perfect temperature sandwich with the melted cheese was cold, cheese not melted and the ham seemed dry. My friend had the roast beef sandwich which was too greasy to eat and she sent it back. The servers seemed overworked and distracted and the manager seemed to be irritated with whatever was going on. The place was busy but I was disappointed.  I'm sad to say I'll miss that sandwich.."}
{"text":"The place was clean, service was friendly and brisk, and the food was amazing. Our food came 3 minutes after we ordered. I had the chorizo omelet with home fries. It was just delicious.  The portions were just right for me and I'm a pretty good eater. I highly recommend First Watch. I will be back."}
{"text":"Beware... you'll pay the same price at any other breakfast joint but you'll receive half the portions here. My plate literally had one egg, one pancake and one sausage link....... these are the same portions my 2 year old gets with her kids meals when we go out. However, the restaurant was nice and so was the staff. Their OJ was good but the food was very mediocre in taste. We will not be going back ever. It doesn't feel good leaving over $30 later and still hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I love coming here. Super fresh and authentic food.  Trust me and try the oatmeal....delicious!!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the the dishes, smoked salmon fritter for moi & the Market Skillet for my significant other.   Actually I don't like the term significant other. So imma change it. Lets call her...BMF (Bad Motha Fff--shut cho mouth!)  The smoke fritter, I inhaled that thing. something noticeably odd about the texture of the salmon but the flavors are there so...as they say, The same in the winter that big spawning ground in the sky.   Actually nobody says that.   Yeah.  Anyways, My wife's dish, likewise, met a similar demise. And it was good. Service was pleasant and spot on.  But... there were those damn greens again. Not as bad as the first three or four times but enough where you notice.   I dunno, man. I understand that everybody has off days. So maybe I'm just managing to find the days First Watch is being chased by clouds, I don't know.   So, i'd like to think Rebecca L. from First Watch Customer Service for reaching out to me after the initial less than stellar experience.   We greatly appreciate the fact that they're active in listening to their feedback and taking customers concerns head on. Allowing these details--however minor--to go without attention is why restaurants close.   I don't wish them any ill and I don't see them closing soon, but I think this is where we part ways.   Thanks again, Rebecca and First Watch, and as they say: So long, and thanks for all the fish."}
{"text":"Service over the last couple of visits has been horrible. Empty tables, but we were told an hour wait. It appeared the waiters were busing their own tables, which makes zero sense. Food has also suffered in quality. Sad. Had so much potential."}
{"text":"We were staying with friends for a few days. Ate hear on our way out.  Yummy,  creative and fresh dishes. Kids menu was a great price $5.79! Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at First Watch was about 10 years ago. Shame on me.  It's not that the food is not good, or anything like that, but there are so many choices in the valley.  Well here we are after a morning at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Yelps app said no wait so we drove here on purpose and the app was wrong.  We waited about 25 minutes, then finally got seated.  There is limited seating out front and from what I could tell limited parking. We were seated outside on the patio, we weren't asked if that is what we wanted.  The patio is covered, and nice, but you have people with their dogs sitting next to you (I do love dogs), but one of our table mates on the patio had a barking dog and my quite relaxing meal was interrupted. The other thing that bothered me is that the people waiting to be seated are staring at you. Okay the food and the service are the reasons why this restaurant got 3 stars and not 1.  Our waitress was very nice, answered all of our questions and provided fast timely service.  The food was very good, but I have had better at other restaurants in the area. I think the damper that kind of pushed me over the edge was the fact that we were not given a choice of where to sit. If was a few weeks ago it would have been too hot to sit outside in the heat.  I really think the people who do the seat planning should be asking  their customers where they would like to sit, like they do a million places all over AZ.  Will we be back.  not to this location."}
{"text":"Oh my wonderful! Creative and unusual dishes that make breakfast interesting again. The avocado toast was a perfect \"appetizer\" to share when ravenous, or for a light breakfast. This will be my new regular breakfast spot after long night shifts."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  So fresh and filling!  Many choices for everyone.  My favorite is the healthy turkey egg white omelette with Monterey Jack cheese with fried potatoes on the side.  Their grain bread with strawberry preserves is delicious! I really love their iced coffee too!  Definitely worth going even if you have to wait to be seated for an hour!"}
{"text":"Good basic breakfast food. Wait staff was friendly. Allowed me to get a side of only the fruit I liked. No wait time to be seated on a Wednesday morning. There was a tv that had CNN on. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Didnt Like wat I ordered its the the French Toast Monte cristo I dont Like My French toast with  meat inside"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because I was seated as soon as I walked in.   Then it was as over, I waited  what I thought was an acceptable amount out of time for my server to come and bring me coffee and water. Never happened, I guess they were all to busy discussing why there was nobody in the place, so I got up and left.  I scrolled back through some of the other yelp reviews and discovered this is an ongoing issue, I guess they were right."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious! Food was very fresh! Definately will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent service, perhaps they were busy the day we went, we like our drinks refilled at least once during our visit.  Food is good, great quality and some organic options. The variety they have to offer is just not our cup of tea.  I would still suggest giving it a try as it's a nice little restaurant and really the food we ordered was quite tasty."}
{"text":"First time visit to this location, second visit to a First watch resturaunt. I have to say they are consistent, great food and spotty service. The atmosphere in this location is pretty bland to the other one we were in.    We ordered the Pork Belly & Grits, smoked salmon frittata, biscuit & Gravy and the super food kale salad. All the food was great from the flavors to the texture and seasonings very delightful. The dishes presentation was nice and the food did arrive quickly, but the server for some reason could not remember to refill our drinks but was quick to give us the bill to pay and leave. As much as their service needs work we will return because of the food."}
{"text":"Food was good (8 out of 10). Service was reasonably attentive and friendly (8.5 out of 10). Atmosphere was pretty normal for a breakfast place, nothing earth shattering, but decent (7 out of 10). Bathrooms were really dirty/old (4 out of 10). Manager was very friendly and seemed to care about the business, I'd give him a 9 out of 10. Food was a bit pricey for the portion size (7 out of 10), although I didn't leave hungry. Overall I'd give First Watch a 7 out of 10.  Would I go back? Yes, if there were nothing else to pique my interest to try and to review, that was close by, I'd go again to see if it's different from this experience (not that it was a bad experience). Would I run back if there were other places close by that I had not been? Not right away. But, If I wanted a good standby restaurant with decent food, a decent atmosphere, good service where I wasn't expecting to be blown away, ya, I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"the portions sizes look bigger on tv, the commercials.  not sure if the menu said 2 caged free eggs because my plate looks like one scrambled egg. I couldn't look because the food runner took my menu from me. I asked the server if the Belgium waffle was a pretty good size and she said yes. it's not a big waffle at all. Small and thin. I will leave this place still hungry. kinda disappointed.  not the place to come for breakfast if you are hungry and have a big appetite.  you can get more food at IHOP for the same price and taste the same."}
{"text":"Super popular brunch places that don't take reservations make me NUTS. However, the food at First Watch is so amazing, it's worth the frustration. My absolutely favorite dish is the lemon pancakes, but those are reserved for days when I don't care about life expectancy (don't ever look up the calorie content). First Watch also offers a great Lighter Side if that's more your speed. A personal favorite is the Tri-Athlete omelette. Not only is it delicious and filling, but it makes me feel like an Olympian just for ordering it. First Watch also offers a bevy of pretty cool beverages, only a couple of which I have tried. Someday I swear I will delve more into their robust menu, but when you find things you love it's hard to deviate. Though First Watch is a chain, everything feels homemade and I really couldn't love it more; that is, unless they accepted reservations. Service can sometimes be spotty so remember to set aside a good chunk of time for your visit. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! I came around 10:30 on a Sunday with a party of 3, and the wait was about 5 minutes. Our timing was good though, because a bunch of people showed up right after us and I heard the wait time grow to about 20 minutes. We were seated pretty quickly, and I was impressed by the wide variety of options on the menu. The prices looked very reasonable, but perhaps that's because I'm used to Bay Area prices. We placed our orders for the breakfast tacos, sunrise granola bowl, and the tri-athlete. I got the granola bowl, which came with a chocolate chip muffin that was delicious! It was light and airy and almost tasted more like sponge cake filled with chocolate. It also had patches of sugar crystals on the top, which was awesome. The yogurt/granola/fruit combo was filling, although I wish I had eaten it more quickly because the granola got soggy at the end. The other people liked their food too. An elderly couple sat down next to us and I was pleased to hear the waitress ask, \"the usual for you two?\" What great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Had the chickachanga and it was perfect. My bride had eggs with the avacado toast and she loved it. Friendly fast service in a pleasant environment. Oh, and the root juice was awesome too! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has expensive crappy food. They want to portray a liberal hipster vibe but there is a lot of trump here. Owned by a church??"}
{"text":"This is a \"Meh\" for First Watch in general. Nothing personal against this location. After couple of my friends raved about it, I gave brunch here a shot one Sunday morning and I couldn't figure out what everyone else saw in the place. In interest of full disclaimer, I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast but even then I can usually find a sandwich or something of the sort that just hits the spot. The food here was mediocre, making me wonder why I didn't just cook at home or go somewhere else for something cheaper.   As for this specific location - it is right by PF changs in Summit mall area, good surrounding, plenty of sunlight if you're by the window, if you're more deeper in the restaurant you pretty much feel like you're in a glorified diner."}
{"text":"After traveling across the country my boyfriend and I discovered first watch, we had a fantastic first experience, great service, fresh, well prepared food for a great price. (I ordered the elevated egg sandwich and my boyfriend the chicken avocado chop salad). We continued to go to any location we came across while traveling. Ordering the same thing each time but having the same great experience. So while staying in Phoenix we were pleased to have a go to breakfast spot.   We did not have a repeat experience here. Wish I could tell you my servers name but we never got it, She poured my coffee and left a practically empty pot of coffee with me. We had to ask for water with lemon and then re-ask for lemons later on when she forgot them. We ordered the exact same thing of course, excited for our favorites . They came out looking familiar but slightly sad.  The lettuce in the salad was limp and you could barely find any chicken in it. The egg on my sandwich was fried to a crisp and seemed to have settled because by the time I had cut into it the yoke looked hard boiled. My arugula looked as if it had been dressed long before being place on my sandwich, the lemon which I usually love had wilted the oversaturated leaves. Lastly I switch out my potatoes for a side of fruit and even my fruit selection was poor and very little.    This location has fallen below the bar."}
{"text":"I completely agree with them winning for their amazing customer service. They are so friendly you just want to stay for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Oh and you can order pancakes all day! Ridiculously close to our hotel and easy to find. The food and coffee were delicious and well priced. When we come back we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Docked 2 stars due to wait times and parking:  The wait here was excruciating...we made a Yelp reservation to hold our spot in line on the drive over (said we preferred outdoor seating, but it didn't matter to us, really), and checked in within the time it told us to.   Not sure what happened in their system though.... Yelp said we had 3 parties ahead of us, then 2, then 1, but then it went back up to 2... then stayed at 1 for a while, even though we saw at least 3 parties go through. We figured the system was pushing us bask since we \"requested\" outdoor seating, but we could also clearly see an empty seat on the patio with the menus ready and everything...This whole time we are sitting in the waiting area watching all these people go ahead of us. It was SO frustrating to sit there hungry as heck. After ~45 min of waiting, a waiter came up and asked us if we were on the list because he noticed we had been waiting for quite awhile. After that he seated us, and the meal was pretty good. Very filling.   Overall, the place was a nice sit down place. The parking lot was atrocious, and I would just suggest putting your name down when you get there in person because the Yelp thing obviously didn't work. Maybe try a different location, especially on the weekend, since this one is so busy with college students."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed with First Watch.  I've been to this location on a few occasions but only for breakfast.  The food has always been fresh and delicious.  I've never had to wait long if at all for a table.  Service can be slower at first but once a server makes contact they check in frequently to see if there's anything you need.    I like that they have healthier options including mixed greens with breakfast.  I asked for the mixed greens instead of the potatoes that usually came with the omelet I ordered and I wasn't even charged extra.  I also like the fact that they will give you coffee to go.  It's good to always have a place like this close to home."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict and they were a delight. Our waitress was alright, she seemed like a nice person at first but then she said she would get us more coffee and she never came back, so that just shows the type of person she is."}
{"text":"Consistently good breakfast food. Prices are average, and service is generally very good. Usually crowded on the weekends. They serve breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is all-day, but they're only open until 2:30pm."}
{"text":"First Watch cornered this new location and their menu is yummy! First impression on a late Thursday morning is Assume a Seat Yourself. Rolled silverware is left across the table, in lieu of near guest. Booths not fully cleaned. Egg overcooked within grilled sourdough bread. Beau's eats were traditional eggs and bacon.  Multigrain toast and sourdough could both be improved with a local bakery.  Cashier walks away before we sign off on the check... there was a thank you there somewhere."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. We've needed a new option in the area and this is a great place for bfast or lunch. I love the vibe and the service was good. The food was even better. Had the chickenchangma and it was 5 star. My wife has bacon and avocado omelette which was good as well but not as good as mine. Definitely a return visit is in order."}
{"text":"Really good place to go for a breakfast with friends. I went only a couple of times and each time I like to try something  new. Eggs benedict was awesome!"}
{"text":"Food here is really tasty. Love the avocado toast, lemon ricotta pancakes, bacon and chickichanga. Server was sweet"}
{"text":"First time in today. At first entering the restaurant the atmosphere is very nice. We were quick to get seated which is abnormal as they are usually super busy. After being seated it took about ten minutes for our server to greet us. The coffee they brought to our table was luke warm at best. Not even an apology from our server. After ordering the food to our suprise it came out rather quickly. The food itself was fairly good, not overly amazing as it sounds on most of the reviews. We ordered the millionare's bacon I have to say nothing millionare about it. The bacon was very thinly sliced and undercooked and super sweet. I thought it would have been thick cut, seasond well with brown sugar and black pepper to offset the sweetness and perfectly cooked. After you finish eating you have to pay at the hostess station which in my mind is not the best setup. It gets very congested in the lobby with people waiting to get seated and people waiting to pay. Overall not the experience we were expecting."}
{"text":"Randomly walked in here while I was visiting Tempe . Just looking for something to eat after my girlfriend ditched me to go to work. My server Johnnie recommended the açaí squeeze to drink and that drink is so tasty woke my taste buds right up. Then my boy johnnie recommended the chicken chimichurri hash, holy shit!!! I wish I could eat this hash everyday, like this was some next level breakfast food. Big shouts out to Johnnie for taking care of me and giving me the heads up on what was the bombdiggity choices for food and drink. For sure , for sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast/lunch cafe. Menu has a great variety that everyone can find something to eat. Also a very healthy menu, with lots of yummy options. Our server was very pleasant and offered her favorites on the menu when we could not decide. The omlete I had was very tasty along with fruit and toast. For sure would be back!"}
{"text":"First time going here and I will definitely come back next time I am in Arizona. The worst part was that they only have 10 locations all in Arizona , (coming soon to Tennessee and Florida) however it is worth the trip!  They have fantastic service, staff and food!! They offer delicious breakfast creations both sweet and savory as well as yummy lunch options. And the prices are reasonable for the food you'll get, good portion meals from about $8-$12. They also have water and coffee waiting for you as soon as you're seated. On this trip I tried the following menu items that I highly recommend: AVOCADO TOAST:  This is a definite must try when you go, and proably something I'd get every visit. I have had homemade avocado toast before, but nothing like this. There toast is the perfect ratio of smashed avocado to thick cut whole grain toast and that drizzle of lemon and dash of salt, put it all together and it's magic in your mouth.  ELEVATED EGG SANDWHICH: A delicious upgrade on the classic egg sandwich. This sandwich contains cage-free eggs (cooked how you wish, I ordered it with scrambled and it was amazing), crispy bacon, Gruyere cheese, avocado, mayo and lemon dressed arugula on a brioche bun. Served with a side of potatoes. I would definitely get again.  LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES:  Due to all of the food we ordered, we decided to have wisdom and only order one, and it was the wrong choice. We should've ordered more. It contained lemon custard and fresh strawberries served on a ricotta pancake and every bit left me wanting more.  CHICKEN SALAD MELT & BUTTERNUT SQUASH BISQUE: For all those who like a more savory option, I recommend this item. Their chicken salad is made with rasians, apple, celery and a whole lot of love on grilled artisan whole grain toast topped with fresh tomato. The side bisque was amazing, creamy, sweet and delicious. MAPLE BACON:  We ordered a side of bacon drizzled with maple syrup and although it was the least satisfying thing I tried, it was still great. So if you want sweet and savory all in one this is for you.  Kids meals a good size portions and just as delicious. (Try the Grilled Cheese and fresh fruit)"}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we never made it past the host stand. It's Mother's Day, a very busy day for restaurants and we fully expected a long wait. My spouse called the day before to check on call ahead seating and was told to call approximately 90 minutes before our expected arrival time to get a place in line. The morning of we called back and were informed that they don't take call aheads but to download their app to reserve a spot. This was easy enough to do and the app displayed a 12:20pm seating time. We arrived a few minutes before that and checked in at the host stand where we told that it would \"pretty close\" to the app time.  After waiting for 10 minutes we checked with a different staff member and were told no, it's going to be another 45 minutes.  While waiting we tried refreshing the app but no changes to exit time were posted."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with wonderful food choices.  Service seems top knotch!  Avacado toast is GREAT."}
{"text":"If I could leave a half star I would. After a 30 minute wait, the restaurant only partially full we got seated. It took almost 10 full minutes for someone to come to our table. The server was nice but awful. She came to the table once after how long we waited to take our order, bring back drinks and to check on us once after the runner brought the food. And then of course to bring the check. The food came out quicker than it should, which was unsettling. The French toast was soggy and doughy, almost like it was under cooked. It tasted like it came out of the freezer, not like fresh bread.  The omelette I had was tasteless, the veggies were not seasoned at all. It looked sloppy and thrown in eggs.  I dont know how this place has 4 stars, this is one of the worst breakfast places I've ever been to. Not to mention the price they charge doesnt match what you get. For the 3 of us to eat it was 60 dollars. That's ridiculous. I will never go back. Dont waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"I've got a couple of things to say about the establishment... I ordered the bacon and onion hash with added mushrooms. About 40% of the plate now being digested, I felt really sick, I mean wanting to throw up when I looked at my food. My stomach felt like someone throwing up while watching a King tuna getting beat with a spiked club. I couldn't do anything except feel like there's spoiled fermented oatmeal slushing in my stomach... Our waiter was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting, but I don't think I could step back in the place again without feeling like a chain reaction of vomit churning in my stomach. If I was a security guard I know I couldn't take \"First Watch\", because I've got a H\"anus\" crime being committed in my colon!"}
{"text":"The food was really great and fresh. I like that they have a lot of different options and healthy options compared to most breakfast places. Our server was really nice. My one complaint is that the hostess was a bit rude. She didn't ever say \"excuse me\" she instead chose \"watch out\" and \"coming through\". I know dealing with people is hard, but it's not hard to be kind."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good, I have the market skillet. I used yelp to check in before hand and saved our place in line - that was a bonus!!"}
{"text":"I go to first watch any chance I can get! This weekend all of my family were in town so I took them here and they were blown away. Can never get enough of this place! The service is impeccable and the food is just as good. ALWAYS try their new juices which never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Came Sunday morning. Packed, was told they would text me when the seat was ready but no text came after waiting 25 minutes. I went up to the counter and they said they texted me 6 minutes ago however they did seat me right away. There were glasses already on the table and they looked used. I didn't trust the dirty glasses so I didn't bother drinking either water or coffee. The prices are steep and the portions are modest. I didn't care for the hospital-like trays that the food came in and didn't understand the side of greens that came with my omelette. Speaking of which I got the chorizo chili? Omelette and it should have been called the grilled onion omelette as that was 50% of the filling. And I'm an onion guy so, phew, anyways, I didn't care for the line to pay too. Nothing stinks like waiting in a line for a seat and then waiting in a line to pay your bill. 3 stars because service was decent, food didn't kill me. Recommendations: clean the glasses, bigger portions or cheaper meals, ditch the hospital trays, less onion in the chorizo omelette, the pancake meal should come with 2 pancakes and more than 1 nub of sausage. The side to the omelette should be something other than the green floss on the side(salad?)"}
{"text":"I thought this spot was ok. I heard good things from others but maybe the word of mouth was a bit too overhyped. My girlfriend and I went for Sunday breakfast, she had the special bacon and a carrot cake pancake; I had a dish on the lighter side, egg whites, English muffin and a side of fruit. The bacon was as good as I would have hoped, the carrot  cake pancake was awesome! (You have to like carrot cake though) otherwise it's very overwhelming. The service was great, from the hostesses, the manager and our server.  Expect a wait if you go on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This was another great Yelp find. Delicious breakfast & brunch foods with lots of healthy options. They have good coffee, which is a lot for me to say because I'm picky. They have fresh juices that looked good, but I was too full to try. The portions were good, not ridiculous big but not small. Close to the ASU campus and easy to find. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Yummy as always.  I had the Turkey Chive Crepe Eggs.  It was great.  I wish they still had the California Delight on the menu.  That was my favorite.  This is the location nearest my work and I was surprised to get 1) a parking spot and 2) a table with no wait.  It is right across from St. Joe's and it is always packed.  But apparently 12:40 is the time to go.  Darn, I gave away the secret."}
{"text":"On an early morning house hunting Trip I had noticed first watch and knew it had a reputation of healthy fare.  So we decided to check it out.  Our service was solid, the waitress brought us a thermos of coffee which was unexpected but totally awesome.  I ordered the breakfast tacos and the lady the chocolate chip pancake.  Although I sort of wonder if they're using quail eggs because the two eggs she received with her gigantic pancake were small.  What gets First Watch to the fourth star is our waitress, she was grinding the whole time.  I would have to say the food, although delicious was only three star worthy.  She had the chocolate chip pancake, right?  Well, to her chagrin, although she loves blueberries, there were blueberries in the pancake.  How do you do that.  So really.  You had a shot for four, but struck out with a 3-3 count."}
{"text":"This was the first time we've been to a First Watch and found the service, food, and cleanliness deplorable. Do not go. The waitress acted like she was doing us a favor when she finally got around to taking our order and the bathrooms were both filthy. My husband had to use toilet paper to dry his hands and there was a vacuum in the hallway covered with barf. So disgusting. Do not go there."}
{"text":"We met with former colleagues for breakfast. Service was not very attentive and slow. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I come here once a month with my girlfriends and it is always great. The food is delicious, no matter what you get in the menu. And my favorite part is that unlike many other breakfast joints, they are not pushing us to leave, we take our sweet time and they are fine with it.  Additionally, we are usually a 8-15 ppl group and they handle our order just fine. Great food, clean and friendly, great service, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fantastic! From the friendly server to the excellent food, you will not be disappointed you came. My party of there's ordered different breakfast and divided them between us. That's what you have to do because the food is soo good, you want to eat the entire menu.  Don't forget the specialty juices. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"This place use to be The Good Egg and we would come here almost every Sunday and always enjoyed our breakfast. We came in last Sunday and noticed everything has changed and it was now called First Watch. We were optimistic but not for very long. It seemed like they spent all of their efforts on decorating the place and forgot about producing quality food.  I ordered my usual, the traditional breakfast which is simply two eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. Pretty dang hard to screw up such a simply breakfast right? WRONG. My eggs seemed more like 1/2 an egg, not two eggs, and they weren't even cooked all the way through. They were watery and had zero flavor. Then my bacon was hard as a rock like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 3 hours. On top of that a couple pieces had hair on them, nice touch! I decide to try out my potatoes so i take a bite and they were room temperature and not even cooked. They tasted like they were cooked days ago and just sat around until someone ordered them and then microwaved for 30 seconds and thrown on my plate. Zero flavor, soft, and cold potatoes are not my idea of breakfast potatoes. Last but not least i went to eat my English muffin. Weirdly enough it wasn't even toasted, it was a raw English muffin with a shit ton of butter thrown on top of it, seriously?  If you haven't figured this out yet this was the worst breakfast i have ever had in my life. This is also my first Yelp. I have never used this platform before but my breakfast was so terrible i created an account just to spread the word that this place really needs to revisit their food. Stay away from First Watch if want a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Cold food, juice hard sell by indifferent server. Too many good breakfast places to waste $ here."}
{"text":"Every single thing that I've ordered is beyond delicious. Service is always wonderful, too!"}
{"text":"The funny thing is I've lived in Arizona almost exactly 20 years and this is only my second time eating at this location (formerly Good Egg).  The food was delicious (I had the Power Breakfast Bowl with Quinoa which is a word I will never learn how to properly pronounce).  The service by Jenny and Katie was outstanding and since I now live around the corner I will be back!  Before the 20 years that much is certain."}
{"text":"Drive by here a ton and finally went in. Family-friendly, awesome selection of food, farm to table food & decor. Friendly servers. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, fresh food. Excellent, superfast service. Nice decor. All-around awesome. I got the tri-athlete omelette and husband got the breakfast tacos and they were both yum. Feeling full and satisfied, not gross and in need of a nap."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying if you're dining in, this place is great.  However, if you're picking up food to go, you're in for a surprise.  I work across the street and I've ordered pick up twice, both times an eggs Benedict's.  Both times my bene comes completely disheveled.  When it's fallen apart and off the bread all the hollandaise soaks into the to go box and hardens up.  The poached eggs end up breaking and the egg yolk soaks into the to box as well.  I've attached a picture for reference.  The box was upright and put in normal, so I'm not sure how it ended up looking like this.  The first time this Happened i wrote it off, but the fact that it happened again is upsetting.  I will not be ordering pickup from this location ever again"}
{"text":"The food here has always been amazing. And so had the service until this morning. Our server was Angie. She took our order. Someone else brought our food out. She dropped off the check right when we got our food and was never seen again. We all had empty drinks and were waiting for her to come so we could get refills but she never came. Of course we will be back but hopefully better service next time."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Had the American breakfast. It was good. Turkey sausage was good. Someone got the pancake and it was huge. They said it was good. Someone else got the waffle, said it was good. Someone also got the avocado toast and said it was really good. Service was great."}
{"text":"We are a couple of baby boomers that have discovered the joy and quite frankly cost savings of cooking and eating at home. We don't venture out much....especially for breakfast. Our daughter and son-in-law spontaneously invited us out for breakfast and we ended up at First Watch. Not remembering that I had been there before under the former franchise, I was immediately taken by the bright, natural light and warmth of the hardwood floors and contemporary farmhouse decor that welcomed us. We were seated immediately and warmly greeted by our server, Seth, within moments of our seating. The menu selection was unique, but not bougee, was prepared with fresh ingredients (I had the tri-athlete omelette) and was served swiftly by a team of 2 servers; everyone's meal was served at the same time. The tables and chairs are oversized, comfy and spaced so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other diners. In addition to the great service and  fresh, delicious food I really appreciated the absence of  noise pollution of this place. I didn't have to strain to hear our groups table conversation or be annoyed with other diners conversations. I really loved everything about  First Watch..good food, great service, peaceful ambience for a good value! We  plan to make it our regular go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Visited First Watch while in Pittsburgh- it was one of the closest brunch places near our hotel and decided to pay a visit. What a nice and pleasant surprise- walking in you see a big open space with lots of seating. At first glance on their site I was expecting a faster pace eatery with fast service. It was nice to walk-in to a sit down restaurant.   I'm not from the area, but it appears First Watch is new to the area and might be part of a chain? Either way this did not matter, as the staff was on point with their service and flexible with us when our group grew from 2 to 7.   I ordered the smoked salmon on toast with capers and avocado- it was delicious! The toast appears thick on their photo- I was afraid it would be too dense, but it was the perfect combo of soft and thickness. My bf had the biscuits and gravy and was very happy. They have a large menu with many options and also serve a variety of fresh green and healthy juices.   Overall our table was happy with the experience at First Watch and we received lots of kudos for finding the place. Thank you First Watch!"}
{"text":"I love First Watch! My best friend and I come here every week and we are always extremely satisfied with the service! The food is amazing! Everything is so fresh and made well! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well first off, First Watch is consistently good.  I ordered the biscuits and turkey gravy which were very tasty. (The gravy is light brown not white)  The over easy eggs were prepared properly.  My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake which he loved. They also have healthy menu options but are most known for their omelettes.  Definitely a longstanding favorite."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, not bad portions for such a health oriented place, and DELICIOUS food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Their million dollar bacon, French toast, and hash was SO good. Highly recommend. 10/10"}
{"text":"What a sweet place.  My friend brought me here on the way to a wedding and it was a great choice for a low-key but not boring/unhealthy brunch.    We were seated immediately and looked over the menu.  Pretty extensive, with lots of healthy choices, as well as options for vegetarians.  Not too pricy, either.  I got a salad.  It wasn't the hugest portion ever, but it wasn't tiny.  I wish it had been bigger, though, and served with the bread that the menu said it came with.  Our waiter had disappeared so I couldn't ask for the bread, but when he returned and I asked, he did bring it out.  Unfortunately, it was this measly little piece that was pre-buttered (I wouldn't have put butter on).  The salad had lots of things on it--chicken, avocado, nuts.  Each ingredient was good, but a little sparse.  We had plenty of water (a pitcher at our table).    All four of us left satisfied.  There were chocolatey hard candy mints on the way out.  Always a treat!  This places is restaurant-meets-fast-food.  There's something about it that feels very impersonal, but at the same time, it felt SO much better than, say, Wendy's or Burger King."}
{"text":"Fast service.  We had a large table and they did a nice job.  Seems to be a team effort. Food was out very quickly."}
{"text":"We go here every few months when we don't feel like making breakfast on the weekends. I was just here a few days ago and had my favorite dish which is the fresh fruit crepes. They are always keeping the pace moving despite being busy on the weekends. The service is always fast and pleasant. Sometimes we call and order take out and they do a speedy and quality job with our to go orders. I like the variety of healthy dishes and also traditional breakfast dishes!"}
{"text":"My new favorite entree at First Watch is the Chicken Quinoa Pesto Bowl....yum!   Perfectly cooked quinoa, with gently wilted kate, shredded carrots, sundried tomatoes, grilled chicken drizzled in a divine pesto sauce and sprinkled with feta cheese.  I could eat this everyday:-)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The food is always fresh and delicious. My current obsession is the AM Superfoods Bowl. It's a coconut chia seed pudding topped with fresh fruit, granola and fruit preserves. It comes with a side of toast with almond butter. I seriously could eat that everyday."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day so arrived when they opened at 7.  Six of us had delightful breakfast.  Blueberry pancakes, bacon, couple different hash dishes and egg sandwich.  Coffee was really good.  We all enjoyed our meal.  Was first time here for a couple of us and we are adding to our breakfast restaurant lists...service was great considering how busy they were for Mother's Day...staff very friendly and organized."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but 30 minute plus wait time for food after ordering is far too long.  The waitress wasn't overly communicative about the delay and seemed to get annoyed when we asked about the status of our food.  Bad experience like this on our first visit most likely rules out a return trip. Overall scorecard below.   Atmosphere  A+ Wait time (to get table) B Pleasantness of staff C Wait time (after ordering) F Quality of food (once it finally arrived) A-"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. I have been here a few time, servers are always friendly and the order comes very fast.   My favorite has to be Bubba's Benny!   Also, bring your dog and sit on the patio seating. They are welcome and will even get their own water bowl."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this morning after an intense hike, and my meal hit the spot! Really delicious and fresh food that didn't make me feel disgusted after like some unhealthier breakfast spots do. I tried the green juice and the hash with bacon and avocado! My husband had the chickenchanga (sp). Loved everything that I tried! I will definitely be back to try the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast because I saw a review for this place.  I must say, the highlight was the multigrain carrot cake pancake.  Wow!  Server was on the border of unfriendly, but the rest of the staff were great.1  Will try it again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I had a gift card so I decided to give the place another shot. The company seemed very prompt in addressing bad service/experiences as per their response to my initial review. I hate giving bad reviews so I took the chance to update and improve.   We arrived about around 10:30 this past Saturday and there were quite a few people. We had a party of 2, so the wait was quoted at 15-20 minutes. We waited a little less than 15. we were seated in a huge booth which seemed a little gratuitous but we were happy to be seated promptly.   The server was there almost as soon as we sat down with water and coffee and less then 5 minutes later he was back for orders. We both got the Traditional Breakfast which is meat, 2 eggs, potatoes, and an english muffin. Both our food came out hot and pretty quickly a very nice change from the last time.   I know if I come here again to order my bacon crispy because it was little flaccid. My mother ordered her sausage well done (she likes a little bit of char on the links) but they weren't. She didn't feel like sending them back. The eggs were cooked well (mine scrambled lightly, her's over medium) the potatoes were bland and had the texture of frozen potatoes. Not the best, but good enough.   While this probably is not someplace that I would go a lot--It's a chain restaurant with out a lot of atmosphere, it feels like a Bob Evans or Denny's, and the food isn't anything special--but if I was out of town I'd definitely choose First Watch over some of the other breakfast chains since they have a great selection of juices and much more healthy options."}
{"text":"Big stars for food & for my waiter... Big! The food here is good & let no one say otherwise. And that's why I'm so fustrated .. Because there's not a system in place for us the people to access that food conveniently & efficiently. So for that is the big stars down. It was so fustrating to see empty tables all around the place but a long wait time of 30 minutes. It was almost unnaceptable. There's people waiting in draws but enough table to sit half of them all the time. The explanation was actually even more dissappointing... In the busiest morning of the week they don't have enough waiters or cooks :/ So that means they don't have good management or a good system and that is just not better. Specially when you think you're dealing with a major trusted brand. Tables were left dirty for a while, and service was slow. And they know it too because right while I as standing waiting someone who waited close amount of time as we did got fully comped for their full meal for waiting. They must have been a vip of some kind or someone of their liking because there was people who no doubt waited same amount of time or more that didn't get compensated for the same issue, and that makes it even less acceptable. But all I could think about at this point is that they should actually manage the place more wisely & instead use that money on cooking and waiting staff. Something is fundamentally wrong, and the whole situation personally to me is more than just an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Great service.  Darling ambiance.  Easy parking.  Liked the morning meditation drink.  Didn't think the Benedict was the best I'd ever had.  The yolk was cooked almost all the way through.  The waiter was very kind about bringing another one but it took awhile.  Also the hollandaise sauce had a flavor I wasn't super fond of.  Will definitely be back to try something else... Maybe the toast with avocado."}
{"text":"Sure doesn't come up to Good Egg. Counted 6 tables not cleaned off. No one at register to take money, people complained. Whoever was in charge on 5/24 needs to have training or move on. Food, below average, cold and not well presented. It's close by, but Butterfields is worth the drive. They know what they're doing. Sorry. One star is generous. Dave"}
{"text":"This place manages to mess up breakfast. Their offerings seem to be pretencous versions of the standard fare one might expect, but expectations fall far short of being superior to the originals. Biscuits and gravy with turkey sausage? Bacon that looks like something you find at a Denny's? Pressed ham? Syrup served in a glass decanter, but tastes like log cabin? Breakfast potatoes that looked to be baked, lacking anything resembling a crust? I  don't understand the hype, the price or the ratings. This place is highly overrated, if your not looking for avacado toast it's probably better to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was okay at best. Portions were very small. Probably some of the worst service. Very disappointing! Hopefully downtown can get some better breakfast options."}
{"text":"We used to go here before it became \"First Watch\". They remodeled and changed their menu completely. The remodel was very nice and the decor is great... The menu became a joke though. It is like they are attempting to turn a classic breakfast into a trendy hipster menu. It sucks now. Last time we went we struggled to even find anything that sounded normal or good. Enjoy the smoked salmon and baby spinach quiche. Blahhh"}
{"text":"Wasn't real happy when First Watch bought The Good Egg. The attitude of the staff has just gone down hill. This morning the person at the host's table didn't greet us but basically just said \"And you?\" Then he huffed and dropped stuff on the table when we asked for a different table. Factor in a menu we aren't thrilled with, attitude, and the temper tantrum this morning, we are done. We are now at US Egg and were greeted with a smile and a good morning. #firstwatch #usegg #useggrules #notcomingbackfirstwatch #votedwithourwallet"}
{"text":"Food was great hot fresh!! Well worth the wait  Took my 88 year old mom with me and she is not the easiest gal to make happy she was thrilled with our lunch and the high quality of food I figure if moms happy it must be fab!!"}
{"text":"It's an improvement on Eat n Park.  They have some healthy food options, and their service is quite good.  There's outdoor seating, and the tables all have umbrellas.   I like that there are newspapers you can read and they are kept somewhat organized up front by the register.  The tables are clean, and they bring you a glass jar of water so you can refill your own glass when you like.  Unlike some other reviewers, I got very quick service, but that may due to the time of day.  There seem to be plenty of staff working, and the service was very good."}
{"text":"The decor is adorable and the food is very good!  My only complaint was we ordered ice water and they brought out  a pitcher of tape water and two glasses. Cute!  We poured the water and each took a big gulp and it tasted horrible and smelled like mold. I mentioned it to the waitress and she took it away.  I had to call her back and ask for iced tea. Then she charged us for the tea. Seems that would have been comped since the water was awful."}
{"text":"I have become obsessed with this place. The food is always yummy as well as the iced coffee! The only problem I have is the customer service. I came for lunch with my boyfriend this last weekend and our server (didn't say her name) was completely unfriendly, unsociable , and just seemed like we were the last of her worries. It took a few minutes for us to get our drinks, and once our food was dropped off our server checked on us once then immediately dropped the check off when we still had half our meal sitting Infront of us. She was also taking care of the booth behind us and did the same thing to them as well, the tables water was even empty and the gentleman had to ask another server close by for a refill! I'm a server myself so every situation stands out but my boyfriend even noticed and made a comment. Still love the food though lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this location often,but after today it's our last time. The service has really gone downhill. Today they came to take drink orders promptly, but after that it was just terrible service. I ordered the morning meditation, but I got half way through my breakfast. I told the food runner who brought our breakfast out, but 7 minutes later nothing. Our waitress came to check on us and I told her about it. No apologies just oh okay and didn't ask if we needed anything else. I still ended up waiting another 5 minutes for the juice that a different person brought out. After that we didn't see our waitress. Someone else brought us the check. It's a shame because I love the avocado toast, but the service is disappointing."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times it's not bad for the most part but could be better for the prices they charge. Service is good the freshly squeezed juice and juice combos are pretty good and a nice change out of the ordinary. Pancakes are average the food I ordered was good but nothing great. Maybe it's just me because I don't like whole grain whole wheat breads but the whole grain bread they served with my breakfast was nasty!  Fresh preserves were way to sweet for me and I like sweet stuff and am quite overweight! Couldn't eat those though. Eggs good coffee good  fresh and different menu not your day in and day out typical menu fare . Cozy & roomy. Will go back but won't make it my regular spot."}
{"text":"This was my first ( and possibly only ) time visiting the newly opened First Watch ( strange name, sounds sort of like a place for vigilantes ).  I ordered the traditional breakfast, scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast with coffee and a small orange juice. The bill was just under $16.00, pretty expensive when compared to most other breakfast places.  For an upscale eatery I was surprised by them only offering saccharin and Splenda as sugar alternatives. I think a place that professes to be a health conscious restaurant should offer stevia to their customers. The coffee cup had lipstick on it, the eggs appeared to not be beaten before the were cooked ( the whites and yolk were separated), the coffee was bland, only about a half a cup was given to me and the waitress never returned to offer more. I also think a place specializing in breakfast and lunch should offer more, for example croissants, danishes, breads.  I believe First Watch would like to consider themselves as competition to The Blue Door on State Rd in Cuyahoga Falls but there is no comparison.  If I want to pay almost $19.00 ( with underserved tip ) I'll go to The Blue Door and be certain of having a delicious breakfast. Two stars because the multi grain bread and fruit preserve spread was excellent. Also the atmosphere and decor is nice."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant! Trifecta and French toast awesome!! May have a short wait, but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you live near Robinson, or even if you dont. This place is a must try! Their breakfast food is amazing, and you dont feel terrible after you clean your place! I personally love the omelets and pancakes! Being a vegetarian, it is hard to find a breakfast place that serves more than just a typical veggie omelet- and there are SO many choices for me on this menu.  Get there early, they get busy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is fresh and the servers are super polite. If you want to avoid a long wait make sure to get the Nowait app and hold your place in line before you even get to the restaurant it'll save you tons of time."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Eggs weren't cooked and I was charged for coffee I didn't drink!  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was only here once, but I was impressed! I had the BLT eggs Benedict. It's like eating something homemade and not processed. The proportion was perfect. I can't wait to go again and see what other great things they have. I'm guessing by the huge crowd it's a great place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite First Watch in the Pittsburgh area.  The location has plenty of other great destinations nearby, without the congestion of being closer to the Ross Park Mall.  The food here is fresh, with plenty of options for specific dieters (Vegetarian, vegan, paleo, keto, etc.).  I've never had anything at First Watch I did not like.   Be sure to use the nowait or first watch app to get in line before you arrive. I've seen many unhappy customers receive the news they will have to wait, while other people seemingly just walk in and are seated. On the l=plus side, they have complimentary coffee for people who are waiting, so there is that.  I will say the service at this location has always been... terse. Always friendly, but very quick to move, to produce a receipt, etc.   When I plan for a day of shopping in the area, I always start at First Watch to get a great meal before running around."}
{"text":"I love First Watch. This location is never crowded when I go. I don't even need to use the No Wait app (but you should still check the wait time beforehand).   There is a gender neutral bathroom!! Yes!   Also, there is a cute sitting area that features two garage doors and appears that it could let in the nice weather (if this wasn't Pittsburgh).  I like to sit in the high back green booth-sofa things. It just makes me feel regal.   This location is full of babies. Every time I come here there are 2-5 babies in carriers. Most of them a good and quiet (must be from the soothing pancake smell).   I'm easy (like my eggs) and I get the same thing EVERY TIME: Tri-fecta with seasonal pancake (small upcharge FYI). House coffee is great and hot and fresh. The iced coffee is creamy and sweet.   I've never had the same waitstaff, but everyone is generally sweet. On a weird note- last time I visited (today) the waitress kept addressing myself and my uncle as \"Ladies and gentleman\". It was very awkward, as I am not a lady and there were only two people in my party. No harm done though, so 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Usually frequent the Robinson location, but can't go wrong with either. Great place for breakfast. Try the avocado toast and the bacon! I think my wife gets the avocado toast for us twice a week."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for brunch. The customer service is always excellent and there has not been anything on the menu that I did not like."}
{"text":"Happy to have a good breakfast/brunch spot in Matthews! I was introduced to this chain in Pittsburgh and the location in Matthews is very cute!"}
{"text":"Loved the \"2 for you \"choices available today for lunch. I had the very delicious Butternut Squash soup . It was creamy and perfectly seasoned. I was able to pair that with the Sweet Honey Pecan  Salad had  Organic mixed greens, romaine, all-natural chicken breast, bacon, toasted pecans, avocado, tomatoes and carrots with Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Drizzled with warm honey Dijon dressing. Super yummy and can't wait to go back! Our server was sweet and offered a sample of the soup before ordering."}
{"text":"Had a girl's day out today and we've  been wanting to try this place and are glad we did. We both had the avacado and toast and it was great. I highly recommend this place. It's our new weekly hangout."}
{"text":"Bit of a wait, but well worth it. The carrot cake pancakes were delicious as was their hash skillet. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Each time we return, the service is lovely. My food has always been great and to my expectation.   I finally experienced lunch here, we had the roast beef sandwich that's grilled with cheese on theme  bread, I can't recall the name, but it was great! There is another turkey sandwich that had arugula and artichoke spread. So good. Service is quick. Food is good."}
{"text":"I really liked this place at first. But the past two times we have been in, the food has not been good. The food comes out cold and my brothers toast was drenched in butter to the point he couldn't even eat any of it. The service is also not the best. I've had only one serve who was really nice (can't remember his name, I wish I could) but other than that the rest are very short and non engaging. Didn't even say their names before the just walk up and say \"coffee\". Literally maybe heard 3 words from our server the whole breakfast. He seemed annoyed and like we were a bother to him. Disappointing. Maybe we need to come in on a busier day so that the food could be better and warmer? But overall I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended so I read reviews. So many reviews said \"slow service\" or \"wrong order\" but I thought, surely they've fixed that. NOPE The service was ok but when we asked for water, the waitress plopped down a small glass carafe filled with water and no ice. I looked at her and she just walked away. I took it and filled our tiny glasses. Water was cool but no NO ice at all. She never returned when we drank it all, nor did she ask if we wanted more. We ordered and food came. My husband's omelet was small and the eggs very dry. Home fries were burnt and lacked flavor. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and whatever they brought me was definitely NOT it. We searched the menu and the \"thing\" in front of me was nowhere to be found. It said wrapped in a tortilla but it was wrapped in a very eggy, burnt crepe that tasted like burnt egg and flour. I could barely cut it. The chicken was good. My home fries were burnt and raw, it was pretty mixed. The \"chimi\" thing I was eating had a wanna be hollandaise on it, which was also not on the menu. I'm on a very specific diet and ended up eating something I didn't order because I was starving. We are crossing First Watch off our list for good. Yuck."}
{"text":"This place had a nice, sunny atmosphere, like you are eating in a chic farmhouse. Coffee was great, and they give you a pitcher for the table with a huge bowl of creamers, so you don't have to try and catch a waiter if running low.  They do the same thing with water, you get a big decanter.  I ordered a quinoa power bowl with italian sausage, kale, mushrooms, and two eggs on top.  It was awesome, exactly the kind of food I love.  The portion was generous and I was full, but still felt good about what I ate.  My mom had the pesto chicken quinoa bowl and loved hers too.    Service was friendly, and this is the kind of place you want to have a leisurely, healthy, and delicious meal."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. But the attitude seems to be \"how dare you like us?\" - the wait staff is mostly friendly, but the hostess and manager we talked to were distinctly of the attitude that we probably shouldn't be bothering therm."}
{"text":"We had just arrived into town & we were hungry! After reading the reviews, we decide to try first watch!!! We have 2 10year olds & a 13 years olds & we ALL loved our breakfast from the whole grain bread (delicious) to the wonderful pancakes!!! A must!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I am always disappointed when breakfast food is underwhelming. I had the barbacoa eggs benedict and coffee. The meal itself was bland, the coffee was delicious though. Maybe I came on a bad day, I'll give First Watch the benefit of the doubt and will try again."}
{"text":"After going to First Watch (FW) in Fla. I recently found a FW in AZ. My wife and I were excited to go today and FW did not disappoint. I had the Quinoa Bowl, the Belgian waffle, and a morning meditation to wash it down. The food here is tremendously fresh and hot. The waffle just melts in your mouth, yesss mister.My son had the French toast and he said it was very good as well. My wife had the Chile chorizo omelet it was good, however the omelet could have had more chorizo. The service was great the handful of workers that I spoke with was very friendly and addressed our questions with no hesitation and a friendly smile. Thumbs up for FW"}
{"text":"This was our second time at this restaurant. We were loyal Good Egg patrons for 12 years and were very sad to see them bought out. They had the best food, especially breakfast and wait staff. Their aren't too many stand alone restaurants, especially for breakfast like the Good Egg. That being said, the first time we went to First Watch, we were a little taken aback by the menu. We weren't crazy about our meal but decided to give them another try this morning at the Happy Valley location. We had our little 7 lb Bolognese dog with us so we wanted to sit outside. That and it was a beautiful morning. We waited 25 minutes to be seated. I went and looked at the patio and their were 5 empty tables. We were seated at a table in the shade and asked to be moved to another table more in the sun. The girl who sat us said \"you could at least take your menus with you\". Really? We couldn't believe it!   We looked at the menu and my husband ordered an omelet and I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Mine came with a side of hash browns. The hash browns were so salty and peppered, I couldn't eat them. I also ordered plain Grits that were orange. Maybe I'm wrong but I've never seen plain Grits be an orange color. My husbands omelette also came with salad. Salad.........really.........for breakfast? So strange! We also ordered a plate of scrambled eggs for our dog and he wouldn't touch them and he loves eggs. That should tell you something!   Then there's the coffee. OMG! It tasted like very bitter old, stale coffee. The carafe wasn't full so we figured maybe we just got the end of the pot or someone else's pot. It was literally un drinkable. We asked our waitress for a new carafe letting her know how bad it was. She brought us a new one and said \"let me know if this is not to your liking or else I'll have to make a fresh pot\". Wow! #1 she's telling us it's not fresh and #2 she didn't want to be burdened with having to make a fresh pot. The second carafe was just as bad but we didn't say anything. I also asked for creamer and she brought out a little bowl with single serve creamers and the top three were empty!   To sum up, so so Eggs Benedict on a very strange looking English Muffin, an omelet with salad for breakfast, potatoes that we're inedible, disgusting coffee.........twice, eggs our dog wouldn't touch and when our check arrived...........it was $44.00!!!!! Just a bit overpriced for not so good food, empty creamers, disgusting coffee..........twice and the girl seating us made a snide remark that we should have picked up our menus to move tables.   Side note to First Watch, please add some \"normal\" items to your menu like buttermilk pancakes, more omelet selections, not so much Kale drinks and maybe just some good coffee. We'd be happy to pay your $2.29 for coffee if it were actually good. We'd even settle for decent. It's also pretty bad when we tell the waitress that we miss The Good Egg menu and she says \"so do I\" This was our second and last time going there. There are just too many better options out there where we will spend half and get a GOOD breakfast."}
{"text":"While traveling we were dinning out at brew pubs and other heavy meal restaurants. So we needed a change, something lighter. We found First Watch on yelp and gave it a try. What a pleasant, lighter, healthier surprise. The OJ is freshly squeezed. They served juiced kale and carrots and other blended juices. I ordered the ham and cheese omelette and it came with mixed greens and multi-grain bread. Everything was good.  We found out that this is a chain restaurant that started in Florida and is moving west. I am looking forward to the time that it reaches Orange County."}
{"text":"I was sad to see the Good Egg go, but this place is an awesome improvement! You can't go wrong with the Chikichanga plate, and their juice bar is a refreshing option to have. No complaints, not too bad on the price and we were seated pretty quickly. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This will be our last visit. Though the service was good today, the food quality is now comparable to what is offered at Denny's (and that's not a compliment). And, in terms of quantity .... Denny's wins. I know this only because my kid loves Denny's. Before it was First Watch, the food quality was much better. This morning my hard, overcooked bacon seemed precooked and simply warmed up in the microwave (even thought I chipped my crown with that bacon!)....my 2 eggs seemed more like one...and they were stingy with the jelly. But they did get my pancakes right. I'm no longer interested in this overpriced, wannabe Denny's knockoff restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a nice breakfast place, yummy food and friendly staff. We were seated right away and our food was brought out pretty quick. They have a bunch of different kinds of pancakes like chocolate chip, blueberry etc and the special today was carrot cake! It really tasted like it and it was yummy with the syrup.   The menu is extensive so you can find pretty much anything you want. The oatmeal was good and so were the eggs and bacon. Solid place! The coffee was kind of expensive though at $2.95 a cup but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"I was absolutely starving so I looked around and saw chairs outside on a patio. When I walked up to First Watch I was a little confused. Their logo seems more like a diet organization than a restaurant in my opinion. Maybe the cafe needs to be a little larger.    I sat down with one of my friends and we ordered. I love breakfast and the omelette I ordered was not satisfying at all. The eggs seemed greasy and no one wants that when you order egg whites!  My friend took two bites of her pancakes and didnt want to eat anymore.   Overall, we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We found this place while we were in town for Spring Training. Not only was the food some of the best breakfast combos we've ever had, the service was second to none! Jontae was our server and she was full of smiles and sunshine! If I lived here I would come every week!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots we've ever had. Everything, even the toast, was fresh & seemed homemade. The waitress was very nice and made sure we were taken care of throughout our time there."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. The food was fresh and the healthy options were great. We tried the salmon frittata and the tri-fecta, and were really impressed. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"We have been to  First  Watch in cranberry but this was our first trip to the Robinson location. Took the family for sunday brunch. As always there was a wait but our 15 minutes went by rather quickly. A mixed crowd dining at this restaurant, all ages well represented. The food arrives quickly after ordering. My husband likes that both a thermal carafe of coffee is left n the table as is a small jug of water.  The food is always fresh. Only downfall is that it is all a little bland.  My husband had the Acapulco express omelette, quite good. Probably the tastiest thing we ordered.  I had the avocado, bacon and tomato skillet. It was dry. I expected a gooey cheesy mixture. There was barely any avocado. My oldest eggs benedict. Okay but not very flavorful. Or youngest had wo chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon.. She loved it.    $50 for a family of four. Pricey.  Food is good but not spectacular. Good service, quick friendly and efficient.  Better than \"eat and park\" but would go to \"Pamela's\" if given the choice."}
{"text":"Smaller dishes, but much lighter, healthier, and more refreshing than many other brunch spots."}
{"text":"An old friend, and former employee, called me earlier in the week. He finally was able to find my correct contact information, and he wanted to catch up and to update me on how his life had progressed since we last saw each other - and he was still in my employ.  You'll notice that I often refer to former employees as friends, because ultimately that is who they are to me. I was simply their boss, but I was also a person dedicated to their ultimate success, as they helped me achieve my goals to further the companies that I have worked in. We were a team, and we were friend. Although I was also formal in my dealings, they never doubted my sincerity and candor regarding their careers. Except for a few I have had to fire over the years, the over 100 employees that I have had through various firms, have mostly stayed in touch.   This particular friend was a notable hire because of the many years that I have been doing interviews, he was my worst interviewee. At that time, he was working for a local television station, and he was completely unqualified for the position that I had posted.  He came in well dressed, but nervous. He sweated through the whole interview, had the worst answers, and the crumpled tissue he brought in to wipe the pouring sweat was now shredded into little pieces on the conference table.   But, I gave him an opportunity. And he turned out to be just great at his job!  Fast forward 16 years later, and my friend is now a C-Level executive at one of this state's agencies, and he is one of the highest non-elected officials. Although, he informs me that his bosses change with every new governor.  I ask him the ultimate question that I always ask, \"are you happy with the path you have chosen?\"  And everyone that I have asked so far that is my friend have always emphatically answered - Yes!   And they proceed to reminisce about our times working together, and their gratitude. I quickly dismiss this conversation, as I always attribute their success to their own efforts - period! I simply opened a door for them.  Now, on to how we wound up eating here.  I asked him where he wanted to eat, and he directed me to First Watch.  We were promptly greeted when we arrived, and our server, Christine was just a bundle of energy. She was just so cheerful and accommodating to our various needs and requests - just simply spot on!  My friend ordered the Skillet Hash, and I had the Smoked Salmon & Roasted Vegetable Frittata.  Apparently, my friend is a regular and he is familiar with this delightful dish. He had nothing but good things to say about it.  My Frittata was just wonderful. Not spectacular, but it made for a nice healthy and nutritious meal.   We were there longer than the average patron; he being the boss and I being on medical leave for the week, and yet throughout our entire stay, we were well cared for by Christine and her supporting staff.  We had a wonderful experience just catching up, talking about politics (yuck), technology (YAS!! What's the matter, too millennially urban for you?)  and how both our families have grown over the years.   If you are ever on this part of town, although you may have many dining options, I would strongly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places to go to in the area. I have never eaten something that I didn't like here. My one recommendation is that if you're going on a weekend, to perhaps call ahead because it can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this location unless you have plenty of time to waste.  I went to rest room complete with hand washing and my wife still had not been seated - this with no one in front of us when we entered!!!!  Then sat at the table for about 10 minutes with no one apparently interested in serving our table!!!!!'"}
{"text":"Your taste buds will praise you!!! First Watch has definitely set the bar up way high!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was efficient and friendly.   The fresh juice (day-glow, fresh carrot and orange juice) was terrific.  I had the breakfast special - salmon and cucumber on toast with two eggs - and loved it!  This is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I like going here for lunch every now and then.  The place isnt always super packed, which I like and the service is always quick and the people are always nice! I love the No.5 asian salad and the tomato soup!  This is a good place when you want good decent food and nice people helping you!"}
{"text":"I took my dad here for breakfast when he came into town for the morning. I actually took him here based solely on the location because it was close to my house.  The food is ok, I had the \"traditional\" breakfast with scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and potatoes.  The egg were just ok, didnt really have flavor and were kind of dry, I wonder do they add milk to their eggs?"}
{"text":"Well I was so disappointed.. I would come here for I found to be the best Oatmeal! And seriously this all I would eat. Well my last picture shows his it has changed from one of my pics from last year. It was blah, no taste, the texture of this new oatmeal was very bland! They instead if A English muffin you have a choice of a muffin. I choose the  blueberry and it tasted like a generic from a single package from a box... Yuck! So sad and I won't be going back anymore- UNLESS. They go back to the original oatmeal.."}
{"text":"Horrible experience  I will say it was Mother's Day so I gave them an extra star .  We waited an hour and a half while plenty of accommodations could have been made for our party of 12. They sat multiple people before us that came in way after us. They could have pushed those tables to seat us. Instead they separated my family to two table that were not near us. They also brought the wrong food and didn't give us our juices.  Not the best Mother's Day :-("}
{"text":"Maybe it was dish I tried (Veggie Egg white omelette) but the food was bland and the veggies were mushy.  Lack of salt.  Even the potatoes were not good.  Service was ok.  This was my second time trying First Watch and I don't think I'll be back.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Save your money don't come to this place. Food is tasteless very underwhelming. They use cheap ingredients. I feel nauseas after eating there. If your going to come bring hot sauce so you don't taste the terrible food. Also very long wait time so if your on your lunch forget it."}
{"text":"Tremendous. Fresh. Friendly. Creative. Went 2 days in a row. Croque Madame best thing I've had for breakfast in a long long time. My 5 year old raved about the quick service. Seriously. And my wife couldn't get enough of the chicken salad melt. Great job."}
{"text":"My waiter Rick was the best, very friendly, very calm, and tentative. Thanks Rick, I've been here often and you are by far the best.  Oh, and the food was awesome as always."}
{"text":"We got in pretty much right away. The waitress was very pleasant and funny.  The table area was not the cleanest. The floor was a bit dirty and the glasses were filthy. That aside the food is very good. I had the breakfast tacos and they were great. If the place had been cleaner it would have been 4 stars."}
{"text":"Really like the 2 piece lunch combo option (you can do soup, sandwich or salad).  Breakfast is good.  Service works for if you only have an hour for lunch"}
{"text":"my brother in law and i decided to check out dwntn phx and ended up at fw I  have been to the fw  on thomas before and found it very good. as we walked in the front of the house all welcomed us for coming in and were seated service was very good I had the eggs benidict which was good ,not the best i'v ever had but decent the bro in law biscits and gravy w/eggs the gravy was very good .....yes i had to taste it total bill 20 bucks or so well worth the money and checking out the booming new scene of dt phx"}
{"text":"Excellent meal, quality food. Definitely one of the better breakfast joints in the Burgh.  The wait was about 20-30 minutes on a sunday morning, which should be expected. The food came out quickly, and the server greeted us with coffee in hand.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the \"The Good Egg\" the predecessor of this restaurant. It was a good mix of breakfast favorites with healthy options and with a southwest spin. First Watch picks up where TGE left off and offers even more healthy options.   I do however miss a few of the breakfast skillets (southwest) that used to be in the TGE menu, but since I am getting older, maybe it's a good thing they have gone more towards the healthier side.   The Dobson location only real issue is parking at times. My wife and have learned when to go and when not to bother. The courtesy coffee for the people waiting is always a plus when need to get your coffee on but you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"We got a coupon  in the mail and wanted to give this place a try.  The menu looked good but after sitting there for 20 minutes with no one coming to our table without even getting is coffee or water we left"}
{"text":"Definitely happy to see many gluten-free choices as well as healthier options like quinoa. The food is fresh and delish, however... last time we went our server was just miserable. When I ask someone if they can please take our order I do not need an attitude-sprinkled lecture on how busy you are and that you got three tables at the same time. I dont need to hear that you took everyone else's order and need to put those through before you can come back and take ours because youre overwhelmed and we shouldnt have called her over cause shell be with us in a few. Stinky attitude literally ruined a lovely saturday omelette breakfast. Most likely wont be coming back - there are tons of good places with pleasant staff who wont make you regret trying to feed your hungry kid."}
{"text":"Very good, quality food. BLT Benedict is fantastic. Great service. A solid option in our community."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service and amazing food! I've been to this location twice and I can't wait to come back. I still taste the French Toast.  One item I wish they offered are hash browns!!! I love hash browns so much lol but they're seasoned potatoes will suffice!!!"}
{"text":"I like their burrito vera cruz. My boyfriend loves their blueberry pancakes.  Yeah, First Watch is usually full of old people, but it's nice to take a break from the tragically hip 20-somethings that never learned quite how to use their 'indoor voices.'  They make any and all crazy substitutions you want. Their staff has always been friendly at every location we've gone to.   I think this location is moving to Kierland, and the downtown Phoenix location is closed on weekends right now (lightrail construction)."}
{"text":"First Watch, this will be the \"Last Watch\" for me. Your food is good, I love breakfast, I had breakfast at my wedding.  But please someone explain to me how the following is real:  2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, $10.21!!!!!  I'm not an old man thinking it's still 1980, so pardon my shock.   Anyone else think this is crazy? Click the funny button if you agre"}
{"text":"Im not a big \"breakfast\" person. But this place is amazing!! They have the best pancakes! I could eat here every weekend! Also awesome service!"}
{"text":"It was ok I guess. I had the huevos rancheros, hubby had the traditional breakfast.  For me - the beans tasted like canned beans, the tortilla tasted store bought like mission tortillas & the chorizo was a tablespoon so more beans than anything. My over-easy eggs, sliced avocados & potatoes were probably the only thing fresh. Oh, and the pico de gallo was pretty good. So overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get & $. If you're starving it'll fill you up. Most likely won't visit again. Husband said it was bland but did the job (after adding salt, pepper & hot sauce) since he was starving.  Apart from the food, the service surpassed the food! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast based on reviews and I will definatly be back. Everything was fresh with lots of healthy options. Get one of the hash skillets!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I go here each time she is back in town! We love the trendy, modern-rustic vibe and the service at any of their locations is great.   My best friend always orders the pancakes. I've had them many times and they are always delicious! Personally, I like to mix it up and order something from their seasonal menu. I love that they get new options in every few months or so.   Their fresh squeezed juices are also to die for! They have great flavor and they're also good for you. I love their menu because they have a wide variety of options, from sweet to savory and from simple to complex. There's something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was nice though we did wait a bit to get served after sitting, in their defense it was busy. If I was on a tight time line it would have been too long for me from the time I sat to being cashed out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love it here! Love the coffee and the servers are always kind and attentive. Weekends are usually fairly busy & have a wait time around brunch but if you get there before 9:30-10am we usually get seated immediately. Food comes out quick. Favorites: avo toast, am superfoods bowl, farmhouse skillet hash, and millionaires bacon!"}
{"text":"WOW! What an amazing change from the Good Egg. Simply Outstanding. The Good Egg was a horrible breakfast spot....horrible. So needless to say I was a little stand offish when First Watch started popping up.  I am so glad I went in. AWESOME menu, I love it's not your typical breakfast menu.....I took the time to read every item......SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM! Great food presentation, great atmosphere. My waitress was friendly and chatty, but I went up to pay the bill, the manager seemed a bit stand offish as I decided to compliment the restaurant to him. It was like.....\"keep moving guy, yeah yeah, I know it's great.\" My suggestion......It's a hip new place to eat breakfast.......get a hip new staff. I'd like to see some people with tattoo's serving."}
{"text":"Our first visit to First Watch and we could not have been more thrilled. The menu is diverse and the food quality is high. The coffee is delicious and I highly recommend the Morning Meditation. The Morning Meditation is a fresh juice combination of oranges, lemons, beets with agave syrup with organic ginger and turmeric. It is very refreshing. The breakfast tacos are also delicious. An also must order item is the million dollar bacon. Amazing. We had great service and the staff is friendly and welcoming. We had to wait about 45 minutes on a Sunday morning but discovered the restaurant has an app that allows customers to actually go online and save their place in line without coming into the restaurant. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, really. Nothing special, I definitely felt like I was at the IHOP. Food's good, but nothing to write home about. I was rather pleased with my crepeggs (although I couldn't tell you the difference between that and an omelet) - filled up with bacon and avocado. The chickichanga was pretty delicious. The potatoes were absolutely bland and unimpressive. The belgian waffle was actually the winner - I don't think I've ever been impressed by a belgian waffle, but this one was great. Then again, it says something that the most impressive thing on the menu was a waffle..."}
{"text":"There aren't many healthy breakfast or lunch options in Macedonia so First Watch is a nice addition to the area. The menu serves only breakfast and lunch and most menu items are low carb, organic and healthier for you.   The Benedict's are full of flavor and the avocado toast is a must for all of you basic chicks. I've also had the power wrap before which is bland on flavor, but add some hot sauce and pico to it for an extra kick.  Plus, all dishes are served with a side of fruit, a lightly dressed salad or baked potato wedges.       So if you're looking to indulge in your meal, First Watch isn't the place, but if you want a light meal that won't leave you regretting your decision- this is your place. Feel good about what you eat."}
{"text":"The food is good but the waiting app is a joke. It said 25-30 min but it was more like an hour. We won't come back since we don't like starving."}
{"text":"At here 3 days in a row when in Scottsdale for a golf trip. Good food and service was very fast. Good coffee, had gluten free options and very reasonable price. Would recommend to anyone looking for quick good affordable breakfast."}
{"text":"Not that good fow-fow type menu .Hard to find 2 eggs ,sausage or bacon and potatoes stuff on the menu .So anyway very small eggs ,sausages dried out and potatoes Bad . Asked if there was a veterans discount only because I heard the owners were X firemen and policemen from New York City was surprised the answer no. this might sting them but I rather do Denny's wh Cracker Barrel"}
{"text":"This is my first at this location. If you're dinning I'm on a weekend, I would recommend you checking in and putting yourself on the waiting list on yelp especially if you're coming in the morning for breakfast/brunch. Accordingly to yelp, the wait time before I left my house in Tempe said that the wait time was 35-45 minutes and by the time I checked in once I arrived which was 20 mins before I got there AND I was seated less than five mins. As I checked in, there was other people checking in who didn't check themselves in on yelp had to wait 50 mins for a table. I was greeted once I arrived. Our waitress was friendly and placed our order correctly. The food was great. Not to mention, the restaurant was clean and well kept with their tables. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My first time visiting First Watch, nice cozy place. Service was pretty good. Food was very good,  especially the potatos, out of this world."}
{"text":"It's delicious, cute, and fresh! The employees are great! The food comes fast! This is my second time coming here and I'm very happy!"}
{"text":"I come to the First Watch on Dobson every month or so, and I've become a creature of habit when ordering. I love the Ham and Gruyere Cheese Omelet, and the Bacado omelet! The Avocado Toast is filling and tasty. I also enjoy the half sandwich and salad for lunch. I recommend asking for the multigrain bread as a substitute, as it's waaaay better than the regular bread they use.  The salmon frittata is disgusting, don't do it. Just trust me on this one.   I've just tried the Wake Up Call drink and it is my new favorite! The coffee is fresh and rich. No bitter taste (I drink my coffee black).  Service is friendly, but this place is always packed, so be patient if they don't check on you as much as you'd like. Sundays there is always a wait. This place has a great atmosphere for breakfast and lunch, and the decor is modern and rustic at the same time. Overall, First Watch is a safe choice. Try it!"}
{"text":"Hot progressive indie rock music brings energy to First Watch My waitress was kinda hip and friendly. Like the experience. Shelby - of course that's her name. And the food, healthy and delicious. Yes! Yes! My only experience is breakfast, but my omelette, stone ground wheat toast and salad was tasty. Add pico de gallo. Strong flavorful coffee, just the way I like it. Go here now!"}
{"text":"Love the franchise, but can no longer visit this location. Which is a shame because I live and work within the community and have for over five years. Service in general has gone down hill, we've left after waiting for 20 minutes for anyone to speak to us after we've been seated. Lemon with water isn't an option regardless of how often you've asked for the lemon. Plus, when you order a dish with avocado as a prominent feature, they serve you crap avocado. Not just a small quantity, but also poor quality. Do yourself a favor and go visit the other locations."}
{"text":"Surprised at the location that this place serves some delicious food. Kind, fast service, clean, cozy environment, and many unique choices on the menu for breakfast and brunch. Gets busy on the weekends, but the turn around is pretty fast which means you can get seated pretty quick. Been there twice and both visits were good experiences. Average ticket is about $10-$12 and the portions are plenty. Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"I love the avocado toast here. It's served with 2 eggs. It's very filling and is a dish you can share. The kids chocolate chip Pancake is also pretty big and looks tasty.  The Benedict with ham is huge.  The coffee is good and hot.  Helpful service.  I will return when I am in the area again"}
{"text":"First Watch is a family favorite!  The seasonal tostada plate was surprisingly delicious.  I wasn't sure about the feta cheese but it actually worked quite well!  But my ultimate favorite is the avocado toast plate with the basted eggs.  This was our second time having Jimmy as our server and the first time he was being trained.  He has come a long way and gaining confidence on serving.   Great service today!"}
{"text":"Avocado toast and turmeric lemonade were really good. Taking off one star because the House Potatoes were over seasoned"}
{"text":"For a chain breakfast spot, I was pleasantly surprised.  They now carry cold brew which wasn't the strongest I've had but actually pretty good! I was able to drink this with no milk whatsoever. It almost had a sweet-ish taste to it. I'm incredibly hard to please in the cold brew area so hats off to first watch.   For breakfast I chose the avocado toast with 2 eggs. I do wish the eggs were cooked a slight bit more. They were almost too yolky which is hard to do. It was like a cracked the egg raw when the gold broke open. It was tasty, but I'd probably ask for no oil next time.   2 members of the party chose the salmon frittata and the salmon Benedict. Both enjoyed their dishes.   We also shared a chocolate chip pancake. they are pretty big so sharing is recommended. They make them with a multigrain batter which I didn't even notice, (one member \"noticed\" but I highly doubt she did.. picky). I thought the pancake was great and not overwhelmed with chocolate.   Decent prices for the food as well. I wish there were some of these near home!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Breakfast with a buddy and the kids. Very busy place so call ahead on weekends. Polite and gracious service. Decent selection of food for all types of diets."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to dislike this place but I was wrong!  It's cheap but very fresh/good quality food with a variety of other options for those who really are not that into breakfast food.  I came against my will (secretly whining like a big baby on the inside) but left thinking it could be a new regular lunch spot. I had a half sandwich and salad combo which was great! They don't skimp on toppings and the food was very flavorful considering that I expected it to be a health food joint.  Give it a try! Nikki likes it :)"}
{"text":"I had great expectations, the menu was exciting, some natural selections, juices, cage free eggs, etc.  It was my first visit to First Watch.    I ordered the Avocado Toast and an egg.  The thick brown bread was cold.  The avocado real cold.  I expected this to be warm.  The egg had light and dark yellow highlights and was not fluffy.  It just laid there.  There was no garnish or other color. ( I would have included a pico de gallo or a little fruit for a pop of color and flavor.)  It could have been much better for almost $10. I actually, was still hungry.    My friend had a breakfast burrito, it was \"healthy\" with quinoa, corn, pepper strips, black beans, egg whites, and had no real taste.  He kept salting it.    The coffee was fresh, dark and aromatic...we enjoyed that.  I would love to come back, but...."}
{"text":"Needed somewhere to eat breakfast in between appointments & I'm pleasantly surprised. We were warmly greeted & seated right away. The decor is modern but simple & unobtrusive. Service was awesome & we were attended to often. We had the classic breakfast with Belgian Waffle & it was delicious. Fresh ingredients and cooked to exact specifications (I don't dig limp bacon or browned eggs!) I didn't get to take any pics because we chomped it down so fast but let me just say the presentation was lovely, a more upscale plate & silverware setting than your average Joe place like um, rhymes with Benny's, etc. I especially loved my iced coffee, what a welcome change from the usual burnt, bitter tasting leftover coffee from last night. A little more pricey than I'd like & the portion wasn't that big FOR the price hence 4 Stars but I would come back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for breakfast. Great service, great food, fair prices, and free WiFi.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere. Large menu! The traditional and trifecta are my favorite thing to order for breakfast ! Even with a wait they turn tables quick. Awesome service !"}
{"text":"Just left after having breakfast on a Sunday morning. Love the interior and that it's not too crowded as far as the tables go. The staff was all friendly but overall it wasn't an outstanding experience. My chorizo omelette was basically an onion omelette. I could barely taste the sausage as there wasn't much of it and although I took out a pile of onions, there were still more than plenty in there. It's all I could taste. My son had some turkey sausage that looked good when it came and I wanted to order a piece for myself, but since we never saw our waitress again after bringing our food, I couldn't. She finally showed back up with our check after we'd all been finished for a while and set it on the table and *then* asked if we needed anything else. I told her I'd wanted to order some sausage but that we'd all been done for a while now and she just smiled and said \"oh I'm sorry\" and walked away... also failing to let us know that you pay at the register so we sat there a while longer waiting for her to come back and take our card until we figured it out (this was our first time so we just assumed the server took it.) I know they just recently opened and this is probably kind of a one-off situation so I hope the service gets better. We'll go back and try again."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was great! The service was fine. The wait was the worst. The wait to get seated & the wait for food. We had looked at the menu before we got seated so that when our server came we would know what we wanted. The food took 42 mins (yes I timed it) and the wait (even after checking in on here & being on time) was about 20 mins long. For sure check in ahead and then add 15-20 mins after that. I had the avocado toast, biscuits & gravy, and two different omelettes (was with a friend) and we LOVED it! The juice was okay. Not the best, I ended up giving it to my friend but the food made up for it. Definitely going to come again!"}
{"text":"If you were a Good Egg regular before it turned to First Watch, then you remember the menu and the great quality of the food. Sadly this place doesn't even come close to being as good as The Good Egg was. Our food took forever to come out and the skillet breakfast I ordered was a greasy mess. The poached eggs looked like robins eggs (puny). There is a completely new and different menu and while everything sounds good on paper, what ends up on your table is not that appetizing. Save your money and check out TC Eggington's Alma and the 60.  There was a very long wait there (which is why we even went to First Watch) but now we know why (FW was dead).... we miss THE GOOD EGG!"}
{"text":"Yum! Every time! Yum! They always have great service and great food! The kale tonic and the traditional breakfast is the best!"}
{"text":"We love First Watch !! Great food love how busy it is!we have never ever order something we didn't like. We try to go every Sunday after church ."}
{"text":"Today my daughters and I went to first watch for lunch . When we first walked In   \" it was not a warm welcome  \"  we waited about 15 minutes. Which was fine. When we were seated it wasn't a warm greeting! The waitress didn't even tell us her name. So I have no idea who she is. She seemed put out to help us, rushing us. It seems like she just wanted us to hurry up and leave. She brought our bill really fast with out even asking us if we needed any thing else! The food was just ok. We asked someone else for a to go box and some more water ... just a weird lunch !! I can't even remember how the food was.  It just was not at very good experience ! Sad !"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time!!   Quinoa bowl was terrific!   Avocado on toast was amazing.    This is the place to go to.   Now, if they only had this in Anaheim Hills."}
{"text":"First time to First Watch.  I tried the smoked brisket hash.  It was OK, but not great.  First problem:  it was not hash, it was a \"skillet\" of potatoes, slices of brisket, and grilled onions.  Second problem:  the poached eggs were over done with completely set yolks so the overall dish was a bit dry.  Good flavors, but dry and not a hash. Coffee was very good.  The atmosphere was very nice, but the AC was cranked up way to high leaving the dining area much like a walk-in cooler.  It was cold enough that it impacted our experience.  Service was attentive without being intrusive.  Value for money was ok, but not great.  I will likely come back from time to time, but it won't be high on the list for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped here after my workout and ordered a cold brew. Wow, this was the best cold brew I have ever had! Drinking it I felt like I was stranded in a desert and that was the only thing available. Ice cold thirst quenching cold brew. Highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Bad management? I went there with my mother to have breakfast. We have never been to a first watch and I decided to go there, because it seemed to portrait that there are healthier options available. When we arrived, it was very busy. The only open tables still had dirty dishes on them, which is completely fine. We waited until the hostess cleaned the table and were seated. I asked the waitress if they have a gluten free menu or options and she said that they did not. My mother has celiac and I am sensitive to dairy. I was disappointed that they didn't have one, but that was ok. My mother ordered eggs with smoked salmon and avovado and one of the veggie/fruit juices. I had the works omelette and ordered it with no cheese and no sour cream. Then we waited....and waited....and waited. My mom asked 'Should we ask when our food will be ready?' I said no. Then I noticed that there was only our waitress plus another waiter and the hostess. Are they understaffed? After my mother probably asked five times if we should ask when our food will be done, we finally got our food. Her food looked good, mine did not. It had cheese and sour cream on it. I told the waitress and she had another one made. Then I asked her if my mom is still getting her veggie/fruit juice or not. I mean it's been only 30-40 minutes. I spent the next 10 minutes watching my mom eat her food while I awkwardly and embarrassed for choosing this place just sat there. There was no 'sorry about that' or anything like that from the waitress. I still tipped her over 20%, probably not her fault...but on the way out my mother was like 'Let's never go here again'."}
{"text":"Best food in the world! The prices are good the quality of the food is good the service is good could not find anything to complain about which is good. Wouldn't change a thing definitely coming back for seconds maybe even thirds and maybe even later today!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as always BUT the wait once we were seated was horrendous!  It's Sunday morning so we expected a wait to be seated.  It was about 40 minutes, pretty typical.  Once we were seated it was 35 minutes until our food arrived.  The table behind us placed their order about five minutes before us.  They had completed their meal and left ten minutes before our food even arrived.  We will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited First Watch this past weekend & we liked it.  There was of course a line like all breakfast places on weekend mornings.  The restaurant seemed country cute.  The food was good. My sister got eggs, bacon and yummy chocolate chip pancakes.   I got a butternut squash and mushroom omelet with a salad.  It was good but, not something I crave.  I will be back because that pancake was delicious!!  Sadly, this place doesn't have lattes or mimosas."}
{"text":"Great place! Food was excellent, big portions and the service was great. I really like the decor as well, very laid back and comfy. I have been to one of their other locations in Denver and it was great as well."}
{"text":"First Watch was so so good!  Everything on the menu looked delicious, I ended up ordering an omelet, the chia bowl, a fresh juice, and a side of bacon.  Ate way too much, enjoyed every bite!  There were 5 of us, so I also tried a bite of everyone else's dish.  Every order was so yummy!  This will become the new girls brunch meeting place!!! 5 star!"}
{"text":"This place is okay, I will pretty much only go if the Snooze in Kierland down the street has too long of a wait. The serving sizes here I noticed are kind of small compared to some other brunch places. The food is good, but not great, and just not quite as fresh as Snooze it seems. I have only had egg dishes though and cannot speak for the sweeter side of the menu like the pancakes and the waffles which do look good. Not quite 4-stars, but, would go back again if my first choice was a little too crowded."}
{"text":"Wow. Disappointing doesn't begin to adequately describe our experience here since The Good Egg became the newest First Watch in Central Phoenix. In addition to opening later (why on earth would a breakfast restaurant shift to LATER hours?), the service was very poor. After our party of three finished the first round of coffee, we had to ask for another pot; we were then told the coffee was brewing and would be a few minutes. A breakfast restaurant without COFFEE?! It is important to note the male server (we had two) was very pleasant, attentive, and courteous; however, the female server was apathetic at best. She brought my friends' meals out, and then told me it would be a while on my waffle, as it had to be \"put back in\" since they \"burned the first one.\" (Servers - before you get all up in arms, I realize this issue was not her fault, and to the credit of the restaurant, the waffle was comped.) I know they're just getting transitioned over from The Good Egg to First Watch, but it's not as though this is the first First Watch. I think you can - and should have - done better, folks."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst breakfast experiences I have had for a long time. I hate leaving critical reviews but this place earned it.  The food and service was the slowest i have experienced in years. I watched multiple guests have to chase down their server for help.   The food was tasty, but the experience was awful. I cannot recommend this joint unless you have tons of time to waste."}
{"text":"A large variety of delicious food options to choose from. It made me indecisive! Cute atmosphere as well. I'm sure I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here all the time after night call for the \"Trifecta\"--Gigantic chocolate chip pancake, scrambled eggs, and I substitute potatoes for the meat option. Also tried the cinnamon roll waffles recently--a new seasonal addition, which was delicious!  The coffee is great and staff are very friendly and professional. This is my staple brunch spot."}
{"text":"A great addition to McCandless Crossing. A very large menu, so if you have a hard time making up your mind at a restaurant like I do, allow some extra time.  They seem to always have some kind of interesting special items. Really great bread. My husband always gets the skillet hash and loves that.  My favorite item is the Farm house tacos which are small soft tacos with eggs, chorizo, salsa and avacado. They usually come with chicken, but I usually get them without since I'm not a fan. Always great service. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for breakfast options and this is one for the rotation.  It's a hearty breakfast without the guilt, as most options are lean and whole food based.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were excellent and my husband enjoyed the carrot cake pancakes with chicken sausage. Service was promt and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and came to this place for breakfast....absolutely delicious!!! I'm a waffle fanatic, and they are now my favorite waffle spot ever."}
{"text":"This is the kind of breakfast/brunch/lunch place that every town in America needs....but not every town has. Lucky bastards in Phoenix have a First Watch every few miles. Top drawer omelettes, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches, juices and coffee. And a wait staf that seems to really like the place where they work.....a palpably nice vibe. You'd be hard pressed to find a nicer way to start your day. You walk out a shinier happier person."}
{"text":"We really love the food here and We understand there is a wait on the weekends especially.  But it really is not necessary to wait 40 mins after we ordered to get our food.  About 2/3 through that waiting the waitress gave us an update and said we had 2 or 3 orders ahead of us maybe and it would be awhile longer.  People who ordered after us had food before us and there were people who were seated prior to us just getting food as we were leaving.  Not the first we have had this experience.   We returned yesterday and we had Cheyenne for our waitress. It was entirely different experience. Cheyenne was attentive and we received our food in record time. Due to Cheyenne we have increased our review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had no idea where to eat breakfast this morning as this is our first time in Arizona. We googled brunch places and this location came up! I read great reviews about the kale tonic so I had to try! The service was great, the environment was awesome and that kale tonic was fantastic! If you have not been here you HAVE to try it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast place to try and came across First Watch.  Nice atmosphere and friendly host and server. I had the Avocado Toast which is multi grain toast with mashed avocado and 2 perfectly cooked fried eggs. I hate when you order eggs and the whites are not cooked. My friend had the Bacado omelet and a Melon cooler. She was very pleased with her breakfast. I forgot to mention they have a juice bar.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"4 out of 5, Being my first time there. My experience wasn't bad. I found this place on yelp. Read a few of the reviews and decided to get breakfast here. The great thing about this place is it offers a lot of good healthier foods. After a 10/15 minute wait time with it being moderately busy we got seated. I ordered The Works omelette, with egg whites and my girl got the cob salad. The food was good the coffee was good and it seemed to be pretty quick.  The only real down fall to me is the space available it's a little tight depending on where you at seated, but over all not a bad experience at all I'm sure we will return. There is a few things on the menu I wanted to try and will be back to see. Thanks for you business and being a healthier choice!"}
{"text":"A group of us stayed at the nearby Courtyard Marriott for a couple of months and decided to try first watch for brunch one day and was not disappointed.  The breakfast and sandwich menu items are home style cooked, full of flavour and exactly the right size.  If you like breakfast items, try the Parma Hash or the multigrain pancakes. Probably the best pancakes I've tasted anywhere!  Staff are friendly, helpful and courteous. We ended up going there on a bi-weekly basis it was that good."}
{"text":"I went to first watch with 4 friends for breakfast. It was so good we came back next morning. We are not from Tempe, we were staying at a hotel near by. Rachel our waitress was very nice, we had great service. Coffee and kale juice were really good too. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bacado omelet and a side of Millionaire bacon. The restaurant was cold, so I also ordered a hot chocolate. When I say the restaurant was cold, I don't mean 68 degrees. I mean it was so cold that my hot chocolate was cold by the time my food came out. I started eating. The food was very good but it was cold after I'd eaten one slice of bacon and 2-3 bites of my omelet. I didn't finish  because my food got cold so fast it was no longer good. I had to leave the restaurant to stand outside in the August (Tempe) heat to warm up. I've heard restaurants make the place extra cool so patrons resist lingering longer, but this was beyond ridiculous. What a waste of good food and hard earned money. If you eat here, order cold food and bring a zero degree parka!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to First Watch for years; it's my go-to spot for breakfast/brunch.  The menu is big, with lots of healthy options, but also indulgent ones (pumpkin pancakes!).  They have great specials that are always changing.  Today they had a bunch of delicious sounding Thanksgiving specials; I ordered a quinoa bowl with butternut squash, dried cranberries, goat cheese, and pecans.  They were super accommodating:  I asked to get it without chicken (I'm a vegetarian), and our waitress told me the quinoa is usually cooked with chicken stock, and asked if I'd like it cooked with water instead.  I was very impressed!  Service is great as well.  It's often quite busy on weekends (we had a 20 minute wait), but they have complimentary coffee while you wait so I don't mind at all.  The staff is always friendly but efficient.  The food comes really fast.  The prices are good too (but maybe I just think that because I like in new york now..)  I'm sure I'll still be coming back for years to come!"}
{"text":"This place has fresh, healthy breakfast, brunch, and lunch options. It's clean, and the staff always seems happy. Fresh juices, lots of options on food! No booze though . . ."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, always looks like a really long wait. Come to find, there's a wait because the service is terrible. We were told 20 min wait for a table, but an hour later we got cold food. Waitress took 20 minutes to get drinks, then disappeared during the 40+ minutes we waited for food. Food was okay, but cold. When we complained, no remedy was offered. In fact, we asked for the manager and the waitress would not send him over. For a place that serves $9+ per breakfast, I'd expect at least okay service. This was awful. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good prices, nice service, you can even get $2 off your next visit by answering the survey on your bill, and pretty healthy choices.  So whats the problem.  I guess I'm just used to bigger portions (yeah I know, bad me) with my food.  Hubs reuben was a bit small and was dry.  Reubens are supposed to be sloppy and my bacon and eggs were just good.  I suppose you could say the portions are what we should be eating to be healthier anyway although I did see someone with a nice sized pancake on their plate.  A lot of their food because it is \"healthier\" has ingredients in it that I don't like or am allergic to.  It happens.  But if you are in the area and need something good and light for breakfast then this isn't such a bad joint."}
{"text":"Have been to First Watch in Va and Pa before so was  hoping the quality was the same out here in Az. The look and service was the same a the food was pretty good. Food portions were well, fresh and crisp with excellent options and they are always accommodating and flexible with optiThey have a covered outdoor seating area with a cool mist which is supper nice!  I would definitely visit again.   Came back a second time the very next day and received subpar service..it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to even come to our table. My party of 5 ordered coffee and water. She brought back one coffee carafe that only fills 3 cups. Food order was wrong, didn't check on us and just seemed like she just didn't want to work today. Fortunately the food was good and when we told the manager he adjusted the bill. Appreciate he wanted to address it and made the adjustment to our bill."}
{"text":"Congrats on the new restaurant concept, making breakfast inedible!  Was the good egg for years,  they recently remodeled and rebranded.  I've always kind of viewed the good egg along the same lines as Dennys.  They are average but consistent and decent value you can count on.  First watch is none of that and much less.     The new concept is to take breakfast items,  complicate it,  add entirely to many additional elements,  and make it Frenchy fancy for no reason.    Went in with the wife yesterday to try it out and there was nothing simple, nothing traditional breakfast.  Gone is the chicken fried steak, regular egg breakfasts,  or simply breakfast.  Now every breakfast item had stuff in it I could not pronounce and didn't know what it was.  Instead of mushrooms they had some sort of odd type of mushroom they had roasted til it was dry and hard.  They smothered everything in funky sauce.  Horrible.  Considering how many absolutely wonderful breakfast places are in the area,  I will not be back to first watch again."}
{"text":"While the food is average the price for what you receive is far below average. I love avocado toast also when I found out they have it on the menu I was thrilled. For $10 you receive one piece of toast (cut in two pieces) topped with avocado and one egg. Definitely not worth $10. Since I won't order that anymore I decided to try lunch to go today. It didn't get any better. I ordered soup and salad combo. When I got it back to my office I found a less than half full cup of soup and tiny salad. The salad didn't even have all the ingredients that were stated on the menu. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today at 1:45pm.  Fairly busy.  Nice day.  My wife and I both ordered the AB&J waffle.  Mine with turkey links.  Listed with strawberries, maple butter, and strawberry topping.  Had very little of all three items.  Maybe one strawberry cut up,  not enough maple butter to taste it, ,and a drizzle of topping.  Did ask for more topping and we both got it.  Thought $9.00 each for a waffle with not much else on it was to much to charge.  Have been their multiple times and never have run into a poor meal before.  It did take a good while to get the order out to us as well.  Meal tasted fine when it all came together."}
{"text":"Was treated by a super friendly host named Laura! (I believe) Our waitress was pleasant & attentive. My farmhouse skillet hash was super yummy. Very pleased every time. Don't ever let me down!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here. I love the staff and the juice and coffee. But the best item on the menu is the AVOCADO TOAST OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Each time I have gone the food has been delicious and makes you feel good cause it's healthy. Always busy, but we put our name on the waitlist via yelp and got in less than the quoted 10 minutes. Also the   N Scottsdale rd location is very spacious so it was easy maneuvering my stroller."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent!! Our first time..we were welcomed warmly and had a wonderful server. Food was amazing. The strawberry, lemon and basil juice cooler was the best. Decor was nice were great and all was clean!  APLUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving First Watxh 4 stars because i have enjoyed this place for over 20 years. I have been ordering the same dish, the over lightly the entire time....until they removed it from the menu. This has been a huge disappointment.  I believe they need to bring it back with the poppy seed dressing and the sprouts. This is a delicious meal. I am happy to see the improvement on the potatoes and the bread vs. English muffin. Bread and jam are great too. Potatoes should be listed as an option on the breakfast dishes that have a salad. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict today and will never order that again. The plate that it came on was too small and there was too much ham and not enough hollandaise sauce. My husband ordered the seasonal briskit skillet and loved it. The changes to the interior are very nice but will not be happy until the over lightly makes a return. Everyone i have ever brought to First Watch has loved that dish as much as I have. Please bringbit back! Also we had a great waitress today. Good experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to first watch for over 20 years and love it. We went to this location on fathers day and it was great. I had the heirloom tomato toast, its new and i loved it. Iced coffee was also very good. I miss the over lightly crepe that has been taken off the menu. Please please bring it back...poppyseed dressing with the sprouts on top. That was the best crepe ever and everyone i ever brought there has loved it. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I wonder if it helps to mention that we ate here twice over the 4th of July weekend for brunch?  Service was fantastic both times.  The food is just as delicious as it is varied.  The Lumberjack is perfect for someone with a big hunger to fill.  The quinoa bowls perfectly yummy - a great departure from the usual brunch fare.  I applaud them for the presentation, quality, price, and service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The service was worth 4 stars but the kitchen was 2 stars. Come on, it's breakfast food, not rocket science. When breakfast potatoes are plated at only room temperature, they'll be cold moments after getting to the table. The wait staff brought another order, only slightly warmer. The medium sized pancakes were silver dollar sized, which the wait staff noticed on delivery and told us they would make right, and they did. The bacado omelet was missing the pico de gallo, which the waitress got but not until after the omelet had started to get cold. The waitress made everything right, but the kitchen needs to know their dishes. We were told the \"big\" manager wasn't in and that's why the kitchen was having issues. When I went to pay, the cashier asked me how everything was, so I told him the truth. He apologized and took the omelet off the bill, while commenting that it's Monday and it had been a rough weekend...??? Again, they eventually made everything right, but it was just too much of a struggle for just breakfast."}
{"text":"The service is really great. The food is different and tasty. Be sure to get there early in the morning or you will have to wait 45 minutes to an hour. It shows that they are popular but can be hard to wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The food here is not \"boring\". I think the first reviewer was a little harsh.  This is a decent breakfast, brunch, & lunch place.  The omelets are tasty. I thought I remember them being bigger than the omelet from my last visit. Hmm oh well. They get your order right when you customize & add/subtract ingredients.  After having the potatoes at Scramble I fear First Watch's will never compare though.  The Floridian French Toast is really good! You get 2 or 3 pieces of sourdough bread with wheat germ, sliced banana, sliced kiwi, & berries. YUM! It's tasty & it at least feels healthy because of the fruit lol  Last time I was here I got the mango iced tea. Pretty good. I liked it."}
{"text":"Seated quick, greeted quick, food served quick, attentive service.... Menu is fresh and fun. Three stars are for lack of integrity to brand concept. I ordered a fresh kale juice and waitress comes back from kitchen saying they are out and proceeded to say that they make 3 glasses a day and when they are gone they are gone. When a restaurant serves a large number of people every day their should be a certain percentage of those items available. Further, one can juice and it will keep incredibly fresh for a week!! Educate yourselves folks. It's either fresh and juiced per glass or at the least do up a big batch. Serve your customers. Also, Greens that came with omelet were mostly wilted, clearly not fresh and absolutely lacked flavor. I asked for green chilies and jalapeños added to breakfast and they were there but had to really search. Lastly, individual packaged creamers may be more cost effective but lack the freshness and if First Watch did a little research they would find these items are not fresh at all. I will be back but hope I can see some improvement."}
{"text":"First Watch guarantees me 3 items---great breakfast, free wifi and great prices. Service is unpredictable, but this trip was successful. My com-padres from work were all disappointed in how bad breakfast was at the Hyatt House, so they asked me to pick a spot to eat where we had wifi.   I knew this was the spot, but could remember the name. Google was unsuccessful so I used Yelp to locate Breakfast + N Scottdale. (Note---try not to do this on the iphone in traffic on the Pima Freeway).   Anyhow, Yelp got us there and every was was happy with the results. First Watch continues to deliver consistently good food in this location."}
{"text":"The surgeon I'm rotating with this month took the team to First Watch for breakfast/brunch on a rare slow day, and it was a great meal!  Service is good.  They've recently remodeled for a rustic vibe, so it's quite pretty inside, if a little dark.  The menu has a lot of variety on it, including a lot of healthy options you don't find at your typical breakfast diner.  That said, if you want to get all of your calories in one sitting at the best meal of the day \"Parks and Rec\" style, that's totally an option.  I had the frittata rustica, and it was delicious!  I'm ordinarily suspicious of kale, but it wasn't overwhelming in this dish, and the rest of the vegetables were great.  At 610 calories for a filling meal, it wasn't too much of a diet-wrecker, either. Other things ordered included the Parma hash, the power quinoa chicken pesto bowl, and the roast beef sandwich.  Everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  The plain old black coffee is surprisingly fresh tasting, and comes with magically unlimited refills for the caffeine addicts of the world.  Some of their pancake options sounded intriguing, so I wouldn't say no to a repeat visit."}
{"text":"First, let me say that the service and staff have always been great with no complaints from us at the North Valley Parkway location since it first opened as The Good Egg many years ago.  The food was great and consistent and would have previously given it 4 stars. The Good Egg then began a transition to First Watch and the food suffered in menu selection and quality, which can be a bit expected, but nonetheless disappointing.  It temporarily regained it's consistency and quality, but now looks like they are going through the final transition since they have dropped the The Good Egg part and have become solely First Watch, at least according to the menu. After getting back to where they were, it seems that they are struggling again. Today had the Chickichanga. Not sure why this is considered a breakfast entrée aside from the breakfast potatoes which were bland. Didn't really have much egg as far as I could tell and couldn't quite place the taste until my wife said it reminded her of chicken casserole... Bingo!  Which brings me to my wife's breakfast. The Bacado used to come with potatoes and toast and some great jam. Today's came with a side salad???  Since when does breakfast come with salad? And no more great jam, I guess. The Bacado should have come with my potatoes and my chicken casserole should have been sold as a lunch item with my wife's salad, at least in my opinion. Giving it 2 stars for now taking into consideration another transition. We will probably be back but will stick with the basic things like eggs, toast, and bacon until the quality and consistency returns... Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"First time here, and had a good experience. The menu is sure to have something for everyone, including those with allergies to eggs and tomatoes (present in almost all standard breakfast items), vegetarians, and kids. See pictures of the menu in this review.  Service was good and the ambiance was nice, and not loud and crazy like at most other major brunch places. My wife said it reminded her of The Good Egg, only better. :-)"}
{"text":"This place took over The Good Egg all over the valley, and it was an upgrade. There are lots of healthy options, and a few of your usual fat/carb heavy duty American breakfast options. Decor is trendy/hipster, straight out of a FoodTV show. Wait time on a Saturday morning was about 15 minutes. Portions were just right, and food tasted great. Awesome for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"my wife and I came for breakfast on a Saturday before 9, there was no wait, but the place was starting to get full. The service  was excellent. My wife had the Acapulco express, which she said could have had more chorizo. I had the traditional eggs Benedict, which was excellent. We split a side of potatoes which lacked some flavor. Overall I was impressed, I was worried this place was all about oatmeal's and eggs, but it had some great combinations for breakfast. 4/5 for lack of meat and a flavorless potatoe side."}
{"text":"All time favorite place for breakfast. I love how they give you a whole pitcher of water and coffee for the table. I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far; elevated egg sandwich, farmhouse skillet, bacado omlete (boyfriends favorite), inspired Italian omlete, and, my personal favorite, the BLT eggs benedict. I like to get something new every time I go and have yet to be disappointed! The Yelp app is also helpful to see how busy they might be (weekends can have a long wait) and get yourself on the waitlist before you get there for a shorter wait ! I prefer the Portage crossing location to the Fairlawn, it's much larger."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast spot! I ordered the chicken avocado chop salad. Delicious! I also got one banana granola crunch pancake! It was amazing. Bits granola and cranberries mixed into the batter and bananas pressed into the pancake while cooking! My girlfriend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon. No complaints service was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. So happy they opened here. Consistently great food and friendly service"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow and they brought my friend strawberry jelly after we specified no strawberries due to allergies.  Food was otherwise unique and delicious. Power breakfast bowl was top notch and my friend loved the banana granola pancakes. Kale Juice was also very yummy and tastes similar to Apple cider. Everything was organic and local which is awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Ordered that Works with a side of potatoes and my friend ordered the trifecta it was so good. Also we got the Kale Tonic, it was so refreshing on too of all that, the service was great too."}
{"text":"This cafe used to be The Good Egg and the food was great.  Once it changed to First Watch I went there once with my family and we will not return.  Food is terrible.  I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Eggs Benedict was on point! Tasted very fresh! Staff was very nice and welcoming! This place is a must for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Fast and friendly service, amazing food. Definitely coming back. This is one of the few places i would recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. It's always the same. Fantastic. I have gotten everything on the menu. It's all great. I don't love the biscuits and gravy here but everything else is great. Service is good and the employees are friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Good place for a large group, business meeting or just you and a friend."}
{"text":"First visit today - lots of interesting items on the menu.   We were quoted 30 mins but were sat around 25.  We sat on the wall opposite the host stand so we could take it all in.  Server came by shortly after we sat.   I ordered the seasonal kale juice - really good, lots of green flavor - apple, kale, celery!  It was good but seemed a little pricey considering the ratio of ice to juice seemed lopsided.  I ordered the smoked salmon and roasted veggie frittata.  It was good but for the price I expected more than one piece of salmon.   Made me wish I had ordered the seasonal dish of shrimp and grits.  The beau had the lemon ricotta pancakes - they were great.  That lemon curd was good enough to eat on its own.  He ordered a side of pork sausage - very tasty, not overly spiced.    i also ordered a coffee with my meal.  What was nice was they leave a small pot on your table so that you aren't at the mercy of your server.  That was good considering I had to ask for regular cream when she brought out the pot (she grabbed 4 from the empty table to our left) but never brought out any more.  We were almost finished with our meal before she came by to ask how it was, and at that point I wasn't interested in coffee anymore.    I meant to ask if there was call ahead seating, as several groups of two or  three seemed to be sat within five minutes of parking.  We were waiting outside so I was keeping track of everyone who came in.  The host did not ask us a preference (inside, out or first available) but several outside tables were sat & eating long before we were.      There were enough items on the menu that we will probably give them one more shot."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a mid morning breakfast at the brand new First Watch in Tempe.  Very clean, modern and bright décore with parking on site.  Our server, Justin, was courteous, friendly and attentive without being a bother.  We first ordered coffee (They provide a hot carafe for the table)   I was in the mood for something sweet so opted for the Belgium Waffle.  It came with strawberry preserves, powdered sugar and butter.  Regular maple syrup was also provided.  It was excellent, very light and done perfectly.  My buddy had the Eggs Benedict which certainly disappeared in short order. Great food, service, and pleasant ambiance.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food I had the chorizo omelet, service was fantastic, the only down I would say is the atmosphere is a little sterile, at least when we were there but could've just been the time of the day, Great food"}
{"text":"Good breakfast selections. The employees are super friendly, a nice place to come in the morning. They need to work on the coffee though, a bit chewy."}
{"text":"We came in and ordered breakfast. My husband ordered some sort of chorizo omlette, and I ordered the bacado omlette. I must say, I NEVER complain, but I had to tell our waitress about our food. First off, it took forever before we got our food; my husband and I were joking that they were waiting for the chicken to lay the eggs. When we did finally get our food, the omlettes looked dry. upon finally tasting our meals, yes, they were as dry as our Sonoran Desert. Next, our food must have been sitting in the kitchen for awhile as the omlettes, potatoes and toast were all cold. Upon getting into our omlettes, I had a few morsels of bacon, and my husband only had about 5 crumbs of chorizo. There was \"supposed\" to be two types of cheese in my husband's omlette, but there wasn't any. This was by far the worst breakfast I have EVER had anywhere in my lifetime. Our waitress was mediocre. I kept waiting for her to check on how our food was, but she didn't come back until it was time to give us the check. I did give a 2 star rating only because we were comped for our entire meal. I honestly don't know if I'll ever come back here again, which is such a shame because \"The Good Egg\" at The Boulders use to be our favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I figured this would be a great place to grab breakfast. I was rather disappointed. I love that you can get on the waitlist remotely. And once there we only had to wait about five minutes. And I realize that it's a Sunday, where breakfast houses are extremely busy. But upon sitting down, the seats were dirty, the table was dirty, salt and pepper shaker had jams and sticky stuff all over them, my coffee cup had something sticky on it, and my spoon was dirty. I've managed a few restaurants in my day, and I understand the dishwashers don't always work right. But if someone's taking the time to wrap silverware in a napkin, you'd think that they would notice a dirty utensil. We ordered, and our drinks were brought out. The coffee is decent. But my husbands orange juice smelled and tasted like burnt rubber. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said that's our orange juice. We then waited over 40 minutes for our food to be delivered to our table. The sausages were not cooked all the way through. My husbands eggs were crispy, when he asked for over medium. And my bacon avocado omelette, which is supposed to have cheese, had none. Pretty disappointed in our first trip to this restaurant. Not sure I'll give it a second go, even though it's super close to my home."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing (as noted by others). The menu is very diverse with many creatively healthy options. I had their SoCal Breakfast Burrito, and it was unlike any combination of ingredients I have ever had before. I tried so hard to take my time to savor each bite, but I just could not resist indulging. I washed it down with their MORNING MEDITATION , and once again it was a tasty, unique blend of juices unlike anything I have experienced before. Our server was also very prompt and friendly. We will be back next time we are in Tempe!!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast, and First Watch does it right.  I had a hard time deciding because there were so many healthy options, along side heartier food.  Service was good.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was the food great? Yes. Was the service up to par? Certainly. However, I have waited less time at the BMV on the last day of the month. They aren't serving edible gold nuggets people.....is a 2 hour wait really worth breakfast food? I am definitely not convinced. My mortgage payment just increased for the HELOC I had to take out for the bowl of oatmeal and omelet I purchased ($18 for both). If you are gonna charge that much, I better get a foot massage....or at least a fortune cookie. Overall, it was yummy food and good service. But the wait and the cost make it undesirable. No bueno from here on out!"}
{"text":"Good food. All eggs served are cage free. The decor was modern rustic. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Definitely not worth the hour wait (for a party of two) to be seated and another 30 minutes before our food came out. Service is lacking. They're super slow. It also takes ten minutes just to get your check. Also, nothing special about the food. My advice:  Go to Toast instead."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and all around experience here. I was seated quickly because I used the Yelp Waitlist feature. I would recommend this as it was very busy. I had the fresh pear cider, avocado toast, and a side of dressed greens. Everything was great and I ate every bite. The food was fresh and the portions were good. It is definitely a $$ breakfast spot. My breakfast was $20 for one person. You could do it for less, but there was a lot I wanted to try. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eli was my server he did and exceptional job! Very attentive in anything I asked! I definitely recommend this place if you want amazing food and good service! And no waiting"}
{"text":"Awesome stuff - great food, freshly made and friendly staff! In a strip center - worth pulling in."}
{"text":"Overall nothing special. Food was nothing fantastic especially for the prices. If I wanted to pay that much I could go to Blue Door and get better food. The whole give them your phone number and they will text you when your table is ready didn't work, and when the hostess approached me and asked me my name, she asked me in this bitchy way if I had checked my phone, well wouldn't you know there was no missed call or text! The waitress forgot to give us a pitcher of water like everyone else and then acted almost surprised when we asked for water: \"Oh! You want water?\" Lastly a 35 minute waiting time turned into 50. I doubt I'll be back anytime soon. Girlfriend said French toast was good"}
{"text":"Food tasted good, however the portion sizes are extremely small. City like atmosphere makes it a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Now i truly love this place.  Great food, clean food and great service.  Definitely a 10 every time i have been here. I love the different variations of food, and OMG You have to try their juices.  There is reason you find these in typically your nicer areas, but their prices are good.  a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little breakfast places. Our server was right on top of everything in the food's fantastic every time I come here. Who doesn't love a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  First of all, it is inviting to walk into.  Second, the food is natural, on the healthier side, and DELICIOUS!!  a definite go to for breakfast.  Their fresh juices are also amazing and fell good going down."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, but sadly it was the last time I go to First Watch. The service wasn't good. I feel like I shouldn't have to stare at my empty plate while my server walks back and forth past my table. She gave us our check and didn't bother to check on us at all afterwards. She didn't give us our coffee and water until I reminded her in the beginning, and again just didn't give good service. I expect better service at a place that seems more premium than other breakfast spots, therefore, I'll spend my money elsewhere and save with better service. I had an issue at the Bridgeville location with rude staff, the manager tried to reach out to me but failed to provide a way to contact her."}
{"text":"Coffee and food was good, although I would not order the chorizo corn tacos again. Unfortunately, the staff was rude and stared at me when they clearly don't know the situation my family is going through. I caught our waitress talking to coworkers, they were all taking turns staring at our table after she took our order. It made for a completely uncomfortable dining experience the rest of the meal and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Have been to multiple other locations before. This location used to be The Good Egg. Food is always good to great. Ciabatta French Toast with Nutella Drizzle was great.   Service was good except asked for specifically plain waffle with nothing on it for daughter and was served waffle with powdered sugar and butter on it. If asking for something particular there is probably a good reason.   Overall is recommended to visit. But suggested to listen to your customers when they ask for specific requests."}
{"text":"Second time is the charm! That's because this was my second visit to First Watch. Following a morning hike in the area, my hiking buddy and I stopped by for breakfast a couple weeks ago. The wait was longer than we would've liked so we left. Today (also following a hike) we stopped by again. But this time, we used an app to get on their waiting list, so we were seated fairly quickly.  My buddy lives nearby and he recommended First Watch from previous experience. He made a great call! Plus, I could tell I wanted to come back after the failed first visit. Any place that consistently has wait times like this must be good.  First Watch has a great atmosphere that feels perfect for their menu. And there is a nice patio which several people were enjoying, despite it being over 90 degrees outside. Plus, the employees are very friendly and we received some really good service from our waitress. As if that wasn't enough, the kitchen was really hopping today!  There are lots of breakfast joints in the valley. This one really stands out because our food was hot and fresh and the prices are reasonable. Even though I don't live in the area, I'd get on that app and drive up to Happy Valley Road. It's worth the drive and the wait!"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal!! Went to lunch here today with 2 coworkers. Service was good but it was a little strange that all 3 of our dishes came out at separate times. I was waiting about 5-8 mins before I could even touch mine bc we were waiting for the last to arrive. I had been to a first watch before in TN and this one didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my maiden voyage to First Watch this past Sunday. My wife and I were here early before 9am so there weren't the crowds that I have read about in past reviews.  I had \"The Traditional\" which consists of two eggs scrambled with 4 turkey sausage links plus an English muffin and fresh seasoned country potatoes. This was a filling breakfast and just the right amount of food. I really enjoyed the Turkey Sausage Links plus they gave you 4 of them instead of the standard 2 you get from most places.  The service was perfect, not overbearing, not too little. And what is really cool is that other servers will pick up the ball and refill your drink or answer questions, etc. Prices seem reasonable as well, so it looks like I have found a good \"go to\" breakfast place."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not merely the most important meal of the day, it is also Step One in the All-Purpose Hangover Cure.  Nothing beats a head and heart full o' pain like a cholesterol breakfast, a few gallons of caffeine, some not-quite-challenging conversation, followed by a long nap (with or without romance) and pre-installation of tomorrow's hangover.  First time there, we waited about fifteen minutes to be seated.  Everyone working there was way beyond pleasant.  There's a coffee station before you even get IN the door, which is a nice pre-emptive strike.  Once inside, you'll think you're not attached to an ungodly shopping mall.   Here's where we deduct stars:Just a bit crowded.  Just a bit smallish portions.  Just a bit bland.  We were able to bump into another couple and shared a table, which got us seated a bit more quickly.  She and I had the hash special, he and my wife had the seriously hot cheese and chorizo.  Had I only experienced the hash, and not heard reports about the other plate, I wouldn't even write a review.  Sure, it was a special, so perhaps they hadn't thought it out completely.  They did, though, have time enough to write every single stinking ingredient on the huge blackboard.  (I considered editing the writing to include \"May not appeal to diners who want to taste something other than the tines of their fork.\")  I tried my level best to hear the conversation of the friend sitting just opposite me, but was stunned when he told me he had received approval for a one hundred seventy foot wind turbine in his back yard.  Oh, wait.  At your FACTORY, in THAT back yard.  That's very different, then.  (Yeah, it's noisy.)  Free wi-fi.  Adorable waitresses.  I'll try something different next time and repost."}
{"text":"What a great little addition to an otherwise vast sea of unhealthy chain restaurant options. First Watch has a great breakfast/lunch menu with a focus on quality, seasonal ingredients. While I'm sure many of the menu items are high calorie, nothing on the menu is patently unhealthy. They also do fresh veg/fruit juices. I love the kale tonic. I've been here twice so far and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The service is also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"BKFST w/Sedona Such happy memories right UP to hot cocoa and REAL whipped cream. Since my G-Daughter's were little ones, we went to Sunday breakfast, G-Daughter's are now...22 & 26 respectively.This is how to keep memories alive!! Makes my heart chuckle (:"}
{"text":"Very interesting place. I had the salmon eggs Benedict and it was served with salad greens. The quality was excellent. My wife had the bacado omelet. This was an omelet with bacon and avocado. This was very good as well. We each had mixed fruit and vegetable juice. My preference is the kale/cucumber juice. My wife had the Day Glow juice, which was primarily orange juice. It was good as well.   We arrived around 9:30 and they were not very busy. By the time we left, they were quite busy. Get here early.  The staff was friendly and our waitress was very prompt. This place is more expensive than a Dennys or similar place, but the food is much better. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Our food was cold, bacon over cooked and also cold, enough salt to choke a person in their potatoes. Could have had better breakfast, and service at IHOP. Called ahead fifteen minutes before we arrived, they didn't have our name down. Ended up waiting 15 minutes. Server never came by after someone else brought our food out except to drop the check. Cute place- just terrible service and food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Kids said their chocolate chip pancakes were better than mom's."}
{"text":"Breakfast for linner...that after hour lunch but not quite dinner. I love their omelets that allow me to be somewhat healthy but still satisfied. Watch out for some of their sandwiches which sound delish but are well over 800 calories a piece.  If you look at their menu online they serve it all througout the day unitl close which is 2:30pm.  This was definitely an upgrade from the fatburger place!"}
{"text":"came into town for a seminar held at a local hotel & resort. last day checked out of hotel and wanted to still catch breakfast somewhere. yelped and found first watch. great find! our meal was tasty good and service was quick. check it out next time in scottsdale, az."}
{"text":"Nice sized parking lot. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love getting brunch with friends here. I've never had bad service or food. It's close to home and it's extremely affordable!"}
{"text":"They have nice breakfast selections. Go from the French toast it is unique. The juice selection is good as well. I found the pricing is very fair and the people are quite nice both the customers and the servers. I think this is part of a city wide chain."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Checked in online with yelp and was stated 14-24 minutes.  When arrived 18 minutes later, we were told it would be another 10-15 minutes. They had difficulty with getting us on the list and stated that this time starts when we arrive.  What is the point of checking in ahead of time?"}
{"text":"Really great service!  Loved the atmosphere & the Avocado Toast was good - interesting take"}
{"text":"Great Blueberry Pancakes!! Cane here for breakfast yesterday on a whim and fell in love! Nice ambience, great menu, great wait staff! Blueberry pancakes were to die for, tasted like a muffin and served with delicious preserves. Pork sausage was so tasty too  as left me wanting to order more. Great price too for large portions! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Really Good! I usually go to the location in Fairlawn at Summit Mall, but decided to meet friends at this location instead. We got there at 10:45am and there was a 25 min wait, luckily I used the waitlist on Yelp so we only waited 10 min. The service was fast, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was fun! The restaurant was extremely busy, but is a great place for groups to meet and hang out. I got a pancake special with chia seeds, almond butter and preserves...FANTASTIC! One friend got the Floridian French Toast, the other got the Trifecta...both loved their meals! Gotta love this chain, so many food choices and great service!"}
{"text":"With most breakfast places serving processed food or with cheapest possible ingredients, it is a big blessing to find a restaurant serving fresh foods. I really like their AM Breakfast Bowl."}
{"text":"The thing that impressed me the most was how un-greasy the breakfast was. Especially the potatoes. It was very refreshing to eat breakfast out and for once to not leave feeling disgusted for starting my day off that way. Despite the general lack of grease, the food still tasted very good and the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed. They can get kind of crowded on Sunday morning, but it's still not as hectic as other restaurants in the area. Especially the undeserving-ly over-crowded and noisy Cadillac Ranch down the road (I hate you, Cadilla Ranch)."}
{"text":"First watch is the best breakfast \"chain\" restaurant out there. In a breakfast chain market crowded with mediocrity (Bob Evans, Denny's, IHOP) -- this one shines. Sit here and you don't feel down on your luck and sorry for yourself.  Reasons? Fast service and attentive service. The only chain that serves thick-cut bacon that's always crispy. Everything is served hot. The place looks fresh and clean. Fluffy pancakes, delicious french toast, waffles and omelets. The sausage is substantial and delicious. I also sense good energy, and a bright \"cheery\" vibe.  Downsides? The coffee is just \"alright\", plus I wish they had real cream that I could pour instead of those annoying half-n-half plastic pouch cups that make me feel like I'm at the office.  First Watch restaurants can get mobbed at times. However, unlike the Avon and University Circle locations, this Solon branch is very much less crowded. Truth be told, each time I've been here, I never had to wait to be seated.  At the end of the day, I'm a fan and a regular as we've always left satisfied."}
{"text":"Super yummy,  fresh food! You already know if you've had their food before! I've eaten at the location in Pikesville MD before.  Exactly the same here in AZ! All of us were very satisfied with the flavors, not heavily salted food."}
{"text":"While staying at my Brother in-laws, I was looking for a healthy place to get take out on a Saturday early afternoon. My yelp app hit the nail on the head again when it directed me to First Watch. When I arrived, the restaurant was full with a few people waiting for tables, usually a good sign. The inside was plain, nothing particularly fancy or interesting but, everything was bright and clean. Just what I would hope to see at this type of establishment. I then looked over the menu. What an awesome selection of healthy breakfast and lunch options! It is rare that I find kale and quinoa on a restaurant menu in Pittsburgh, especially for breakfast and lunch. I opted to go with the fruit crepes which came topped with low fat strawberry yogurt, a side of granola and their muffin of the day. (Quite a lot of food!) I believe the muffin was lemon poppy seed but can't say for sure as hubs devoured it before I got a nibble in. The crepes were light and delicate. They were filled with strawberries and bananas but also topped with a few pieces of mellon, pineapple and grapes. I sprinkled the side of granola on top the strawberry yogurt and dug in. Yum, yum, yum. The crunch from the granola was the perfect added touch. Overall, a great value for a delicious meal. I hope to get the opportunity to return very soon."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious! Staff was friendly. Good prices too! A gem... We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's a cute interior. That's about it. Food is mediocre at best. Little pricey, small portions and mass produced. They need to take a lesson from Butters down the street. But this is a chain so of course it's going to be \"no care no qualify\""}
{"text":"I love the food here at First Watch! Everything is made fresh to order and their pressed juices are delightful!   Despite my delicious meal, my experience at the First Watch in Solon was a disappointing one. We did not receive service until 20 minutes after we have sat down. Our server finally came over to greet us and asked what we would like to drink. She seemed very rushed, from table to table and was not very tentative. The decor is also not the most modern and hip, as many First Watch offers a fresh, bright look within.   Heads up: if you are to come here for a meal, expect service to be slow and you better not be in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices! I love First Watch for a brunch spot without the guilt! They have plenty of healthy options but also some for those who want to indulge! You can tell they use fresh, quality ingredients in everything they make! I recommend the a.m. superfoods bowl... amazing! Pro tip- download their app so that toy can check wait times and put yourself in line while you wait at home or anywhere you please! They will give you an estimate of when your table will be ready so you can plan our your arrival! Also, sign up for their rewards program via email, you will receive coupons and a free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Place is great food is Food is fucking amazing. You gotta try it out. I promise you'll love it."}
{"text":"I was told there was a change of owners since we've been there last within a year or less. So they don't honor free coffees for the resort referral any more--disappointed.  The coffee is delicious with several creamer options and sweeteners. Great selection of meals. The restaurant is beautiful. It seems more open than before.   The must have meal is the Avocado Toast with eggs. My husband loves it.  I usually get an Eggs Benedict, but today the Hollandaise sauce was horrible. If this is the new taste, don't waste your money. The sauce tasted like a watery chicken broth-like substance--awful and ruined the meal. I didn't complain about it there, you know what happens when you complain on-site. LOL I just ate around it, but be warned. It's not the delicious egg yolk, buttery, lite lemony fluff hollandaise sauce that makes an Eggs Benedict. Used to be, but not any more.   The waitress was nice, but I felt rushed when she brought the ticket to the table while we were still eating."}
{"text":"This is a reliable place for bfast in the north valley. What i like most is that it is not all syrup and batter-- they have healthy options as well. My fav is getting a half checken salad sandwich and half salad. Its tge perfect place to go before or after its only open until 2) the waterpark."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, it came very quickly. I loved that they had coffee available immediately and kept the coffee at the table. I think the women's bathroom need a table by the sink for your purse I had to wedge my purse between my legs while washing my hands. I think that would be the only reason I gave them a 4 star review. I would definitely return though I thought it was one of the best breakfast in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place when ever I go the food is so good! I get the traditional breakfast and it's so satisfying and there eggs Benedict is great. Good services as well!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning. I ordered the rustica frittata and the cinnybun pancakes. Rustica frittata was exactly what I expected, yes it was delicious! The cinnybun pancakes looked and sounded interesting,  that's why I ordered it. It tastes exactly like a cinnabun and pancakes rolled into one. Great overall service! Server was awesome and food was ordered and delievered quickly. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So many things to love about this place - Breakfast until 230pm on a weekday, An \"eggs-clusive\" section on their menu, Carrot cake pancakes - You can order just one if you like as opposed to a stack, whole pots of coffee in insulated thermoses left at your table so that you can pour out a little at a time and it stays hot, free WiFi.. First watch is full of so many such thoughtful little additions that strive to make your experience as close to perfect as can be. They've a large, well lit space with a semi open kitchen at their Bridgeville location and an expansive menu with breakfast options that only dreams are made up of! Frittatas, French toast, power bowls, sandwiches, healthy options - you name it! They've several choices for the non-meat eaters as well. I settled on the avocado toast and a carrot cake multigrain pancake while the boyfriend had the morning market veggie omelette. I loved everything we ate and the bread that they serve is divine. I am definitely going back for their Floridian French toast, the veggie burger, the lemon ricotta pancakes .. oh well.. I guess I'm going back several times! Their servers are really friendly and extremely courteous. Full marks to First Watch on getting every aspect of breakfast spot on."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast they have a great menu a lot of choices service was good very good breakfast will be back"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Great decor and cute place to have breakfast/brunch. Servers are great and attentive but the food is another story. I asked for their veggie omelette and was not a big fan. The veggies they stuffed in the omelette I felt was too caramelized for taste and the potatoes were burnt. Probably won't come back but maybe they're other stuff is better"}
{"text":"I usually come early for breakfast on the weekend, once in a while during the week. The menu has healthy choices, along with traditional selections. Specials are on the board, and are pretty creative. The service is friendly, attentive and efficient. I have enjoyed all of the breakfast meals I have had there, but have not had brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Loved the Kale Tonic. Super cute decor. The food was good. I got the breakfast tacos because they're gluten-free. Seems eco-friendly and healthy. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"First experience at First Watch was excellent! We had about a 15 minute drive to get there and we were arriving at a busy time of the morning (10:15 on a Saturday), but thanks to getting in line on Yelp, we only waited about 15-20 minutes when we got there, if that.   My mom tried the complimentary coffee while we waited and it was an old batch of coffee. But don't let that fool you, the fresh coffee was amazing! We both ordered the Day Glow juice which is a blend of carrot, orange, lemon and organic ginger. Absolutely refreshing!   I ordered the farmhouse skillet hash which came with potatoes, 2 eggs, avocado, and cheese and bacon, and a side of artisan toast with all natural preserves which were so sweet and delicious. I also got a small fruit cup.   We didn't wait long for our food, and our service was perfect! So glad to know about this popular brunch location in the north hills!"}
{"text":"Had not heard of First Watch before even though it seems to be a fairly large chain of restaurants. Went there with a small group yesterday. They gave us a small room, but the way it was laid out we could not interact with the group only the small group we were seated with. The interior was very well done and inviting. The menus were very difficult to read if you are over 50. We had to pass around a pair of reading glasses. The print font is very small and without good lighting...well, I like to be able to read the descriptions of the food, after all if they go to the trouble to write them, I would like to read them. Moving on, after we all had a turn with the glasses and decided we ordered. Food arrived very quickly and was very good. A variety of items at my table, some breakfasts, some lunches . I had a Monterey Club sandwich. Nice sized sandwich with a couple of strips or Applewood bacon with the turkey. It came with a salad which was just an assortment of lettuce with some dressing, nothing special there. The breakfasts were eggs and potatoes and stuff, when asked how it was, about all I got was...it's OK. All and all, kind of a run of mill place. Not much that would nudge me to go back if I had other choices.  Update 6/12/18. I had to edit this review because I attended an Elite event that certainly changed my mind. I now understand what  First Watch is all about and I have had a sampling of the range of food they offer. First of all, Micheal, the manager explained the philosophy of the restaurant chain, with the central idea being FRESH. Where they get their food and coffee from and how it is prepared make a significant difference and I totally agree with all he said. Then there is the food. We had a 4 course sample menu and I must say each course was great. The million dollar bacon was like eating candied bacon, an unusual taste treat. The avocado toast was great, I wanted to eat more but I knew we were just starting off. The street food with tortilla was wonderful, many great ingredients blended well together.  The ham and cheese, with Dijon grilled sandwich was again wonderful. And to finish the pancakes with strawberries and lemon was a nice end.  The various juices were interesting, all different and unique tastes. All in all the representation of food on the menu was excellent and there is nothing I would change. The service was also excellent.  So, I amend my previous review and would certainly give First Watch, without reservation a 5 star review."}
{"text":"What a joint!  The food is fresh and delicious (big party, tried 5 different dishes). Savannah, our server was incredible as we threw everything but the kitchen sink at her and she still handled it like a pro! I highly recommend the AM Superfood Bowl (the coconut milk and chia seed pudding is out of this world!!!!).  I highly recommend this place.   Thank you. Love you guys!  P.S.  The coffee is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We go for breakfast here to celebrate every family birthday and Mother's Day/Father's Day celebrations. The food is fantastic! I usually order a skillet (every one I have tried is really good). The seasonal breakfasts are generally amazing as well. Pumpkin Pancakes and the Brûléed Banana Waffle is to die for! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Kids love the chocolate chip pancakes.  The market skillet is delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast. Food is fresh and delicious and the service is great. The restaurant decor is modern and very open. A great spot to try."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast + lunch joint. Of all the locations in the valley, this is my favorite because there is rarely a wait. Really enjoy the lemon custard pancakes (when I'm looking to carb overload), the breakfast tacos and the turkey burger is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying First Watch. The food was pretty good, but the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty. I mean, so salty that I physically couldn't eat them in a bite by themselves. I had to mix them with something else, in order to make them edible (and I am typically a salt person). My boyfriend is not a salt person, so he pushed them aside altogether. We arrived about 35 minutes prior to closing, so our server was more interested in getting the restaurant cleaned and ready to leave, rather than serving us. Drinks sat empty for an extended period of time and he didn't check in much, but he was friendly. I suspect that the experience might have been better, earlier in the day. Overall, a pretty good meal and we will give it another try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time this morning. We love going to new places on Saturday mornings for breakfast/brunch, and this place was no disappointment! We just happened to drive by it while we were looking for somewhere to go and decided to give it a shot. SO good! The staff was very friendly and the service was pretty quick. They did tell us it would only be 10-15 minutes when really it was more like 20-30, which was fine because I could see that it was very busy. I ordered the \"chikichanga\" and it was delicious! I'm still thinking about it. The portion was a little bit smaller than expected, but it was dreamy. I love Mexican food, so when I can have it for breakfast? I'm so there! My boyfriend got \"the works\" omelet and he loved it as well. We also shared 2 of their chocolate chip pancakes (we like food). They were good; tasted just like any old chocolate chip pancakes. Needless to say, we will definitely be back especially since it's so close and yummy."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot for brunch! We had excellent and efficient service, enjoyed the atmosphere, and most importantly, had outstanding food! I ordered a platter with a Belgian waffle, scrambled eggs, and bacon - the waffle and eggs were incredible and my friend raved about the bacon! Would definitely recommend for a nice brunch."}
{"text":"Never had an omelette with a side of salad.  Service was horrible. Multiple people walked by our empty drinks.  Overall food is average and way overpriced"}
{"text":"A great healthy breakfast close to the highway and hotels.  I like breakfast, that's duly noted in many of my reviews.  This one hit the spot.  Think 'Perkins' or 'Bob Evans' and better than 'Denny's'"}
{"text":"Wow! My new breakfast spot. Friendly faces (Kelly ), everything is fresh. Portions are good size and very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been to their downtown location and beyond pleased to see them here AND on rural /Ray Rd! This location is big. Farm tables and chairs, wooden booths and a area out side with tables, chairs. Ginormous chalk board across the back of the room with specials and drawings. I ordered the salmon and cucumber toast. It comes with 2 eggs any style. The toast was crisp, yet tender. The salmon was sockeye and not too salty and not too oily. The cucumbers were an excellent touch as it added a moist crispness to each bite. Our service was attentive however it was late in the morning and there weren't many people there. The food was fresh, tasty and put together smartly. My next visit is to the Rual/Ray location!"}
{"text":"This little gem is a great find! The food is fresh, no microwaves and super delicious. It was around lunch when I visited and the parking lot was full. Inside the place was busy but not overly busy. We were seated right away. Decor inside was nothing to really speak of but the food is the main attraction here. I had the \"not guilty your honor\" a fabulous choice. It came with a bowl of soup, today's soup was Italian wedding ball. The soup was so close to my grandmothers it was scary. Yes, it's 108 degrees outside but it was so good I had to eat every drop. The wrap was moist, fresh and super tasty. It was enough to fill me but not leaving you with that over stuffed feeling. From other dishes that were walking by and pics I've seen here, I most definitely will be back and I will tell others this IS the spot for lunch. Sadly it's too far from me to experience breakfast."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and fell in love with how perfect the Trifecta is. Definitely recommend this place. The food and service is great"}
{"text":"... we have tried a few different locations of First Watch since they decided to revamp the atmosphere for hipsters  It's safe to say we won't we stepping foot into a First Watch anymore.. this particular location got our water order then eventually came back and asked if I wanted coffee.. said no.. then she asked what I wanted to drink \"well.. I thought we said water??\" Said she would bring the water and grab our order then.. dropped the carafe of water off (w/o ice because that's cool now) and then left again.. look, we have a 17 month old.. do not make me wait to order my food because if this kid has a melt down, I'm going to put her in YOUR face..  at any rate, ordered an entree with a muffin on the side.. muffin never came, but the bill said we got a muffin.. let the cashier know and she had to track down the server.. just take the muffin off the bill. Does it look like I'm trying to smuggle a gosh darn muffin out? Unreal!  Side note, the side of fruit is two pieces of  pineapple chunks and equally small pieces of watermelon.. it's literally inside what you would give to someone asking for a side of ranch.. Gtfo!   I know I shouldn't be this steamed about a stupid muffin or bad service.. but it's the principle.. they messed up at First Watch with all this new crap and we used to go to the I-17 location every Sunday.."}
{"text":"... many moons ago, First Watch was this homey little Breakfast joint.. now, it seems a little too hipster for me. I suppose maybe I'm not good with change seeing as how we used to frequent the I-17 location every weekend and they slowly started phasing out what made them so great. We brought our little one to this location as it's closest to home and it's just not what it used to be :/"}
{"text":"You've heard of their existence for years now, although you've never actually seen one...kinda like Bigfoot. Churchgoers. Well they're here and apparently, the word is out because this place has a bevy of them on Sunday mornings...causing you to wait thirty or so minutes before claiming your table.  It'll be worth the wait however. Try the muesli pancakes with a side of bacon. After wolfing the delicious cakes, it's time to have some fun with the bacon. It'll be dry enough to crumble,  making it easy to fire through your straw. Your target?  The churchgoers. More specifically, their women...seeing how many pieces of crumbled bacon you can launch into those weird-ass bouffant hair-do's without anyone ever noticing.  Think of it as getting even for snaking your table when the hostess announced \"Smith...party of two.\"  You always weasel the Smith table.  What was THEIR problem anyway?"}
{"text":"Be careful! We ordered 2 veggie meals to share and was served turkey! When we brought it up to the server she swapped it out but we had to complain to management to have it taken off. We had to ask for napkins twice and the bill three times. I've eaten at several of these establishments on the East Coast and have never had a problem. This Scottsdale location is the WOST!!"}
{"text":"Loooooved the hours of operation...ambiance...food selection (I honestly couldn't pinpoint just one item!)...portions in relation to the prices...customer service...coffee pot and water jar at the table...clean bathrooms...Am very excited to call this my new #1 breakfast place in town. Win! Win! Win!"}
{"text":"The food was so good! The avacado toast looked amazing (will get that next time) but I got the lemon ricotta pancakes- YUMMM. Will be back- and great service"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. The menu has a good variety for breakfast and lunch. It's pretty simple as in the menu is not huge at all. The staff are friendly and everything I have had has been delish. I have been for breakfast and for lunch. Weekend and weekday. Can get busy as with any good restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been regulars at this location for the last few years or so.  We love coming here; the food is consistently fresh and the service is prompt and friendly. Today, I tried the new season special, the ancient grains protein bowl, recommended to us by our awesome waiter, Junior. He was spot on; it was fantastic! We really enjoyed chatting with him, too. Come check out this location -you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"I actually come here quite often so I'm just gonna give a general review because of the amount of times I come in. The service is decent it's not the best and not the worst. The lunch is just \"okay\" however the breakfast in my opinion is always delicious, I love it the elevated egg sandwich is great and the Bacado is also amazing if you want to try a omelette, the Croque Madame is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I will post a picture of that when I'm done with this review, so to sum everything up the feel And atmosphere of the place is really nice and Pleasant the food is great but the reason this isn't getting any 5 stars is because the service is really average."}
{"text":"We have came twice within the last two weeks and food was good. Fresh and tasty! My kids love the chocolate chip pancakes. The potatoes are my favorite! Staff is friendly and attentive. Inside is clean and very modern. They also have outside patio seating that will be nice once the temperature cools down."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.  The service is usually friendly and fast.  I really like the food, although a little pricier than most breakfasts you'll find.  However, where else are you going to get avocado toast?"}
{"text":"Quick service at opening.   Papers are available. Coffee keeps coming.   First Watch is an upscale EnP.   Order the Millionaires Bacon!"}
{"text":"The food here is very fresh and delicious and I always have great service! Today I had biscuits and gravy and the veggie sandwich! Every bite was amazing!"}
{"text":"Brunch was great. Good was very good. Greasy ingredients and great service. Very clean and quick turn around."}
{"text":"Great spot to meet someone for business or a family gathering.  Quiet and fast WiFi.  I love the food and service."}
{"text":"Three stars for service. The atmosphere was nice and very modern. The menu has a nice variety of healthy options. I went with some friends for Easter breakfast. We were very excited to try this place. The portion was very generous, but the food arrived cold. Our server seemed very disinterested in our table, and hardly smiled. That's too bad for this restaurant. I will visit again because of the food, and in the hope that our service will be better."}
{"text":"First Watch exemplifies corporate America. On a weekday morning I went there to see why people line up outside the door every weekend. The morning I went the place was more than half filled by office type people sitting with other office type people in booths along the wall. I was not in office attire and the hostess thoughtfully seated me at one of the tables located in the center. Every person entering had to pass me as did those leaving. All the servers passed me and the hostess found along side my table was the perfect place to wait for new customers to join her for their booth assignments. Two women also not office types were luckily shown to a table near me to enjoy all the activity. Could just be my imagination that there was a deliberate decision to seat us non business types in the middle of things.   Those at booths had brief cases, computers, graphs, charts, print outs and statements sprawled on the tables challenging the occupants to uncover ways to sell more and increase the corporate wealth. First Watch has a blatant drive to sell more and increase profits. The food may have originally been created by a corporate chef but was then modified by the finance, marketing, and operations staff. Corners are cut, ingredients are supplied based on low cost, and the recipes are dumbed down for mass appeal.   I had the Acapulco Express. In Cleveland we know our sausage. The chorizo in this omelet was akin to Hillshire which is as bad as sausage ever gets. The salsa, avocado and sour cream had all the taste removed rather than the calories. As a decoration were a few pieces of melon and a berry that were faithful to the lack of flavor theme.   Some have said First Watch offers a healthy breakfast. They did not do their homework. For some very mysterious reason First Watch publishes nutritional values for their items. The turkey sausage biscuits provide the following percentages of daily requirements 77% daily fat, 146% cholesterol and 98% sodium. Healthy?   Lucky I discovered breakfast at Latitude where no one wears suits or discusses company profits. I guess the lines at First Watch on weekends are office workers and their families who love their dollars increasing corporate wealth and who find nutritional info another socialistic attack to capitalism."}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Great decor, friendly and attentive staff, outstanding coffee and the breakfast was exactly what I wanted for a Saturday brunch. I'll be visiting often.   (Limited parking)"}
{"text":"How many restaurants do you know have a declaration?  A declaration that includes meals served quickly, friendly and courteous service, order anything on their menu at anytime of the day, your own pot of freshly brewed coffee, right to share entrees with no extra charge, free newspapers and Wi-Fi, and my favorite, \"to take your sweet time and enjoy.\"   First Watch The Daytime Café (16455 N Scottsdale Road, #107, Scottsdale, AZ  85254) does just this and more, complete from their declaration to you as a customer.   The menu has many a delicious entrée available for breakfast, brunch or lunch.  Fresh ingredients are prepared and created daily.   A perfect combination of various eggs, pancakes or waffles dishes for breakfast and brunch items are included on their menu.  For lunch, a choice of salads and sandwich combinations are available for your choosing.  Depending on your taste, one can order standard items (\"The Traditional\" -  two eggs, choice of meat, English muffin and potatoes), or one can order something a little more creative (\"Key West Crepe\" - crepe combined with flurry white eggs, served with potatoes and English muffin).  Their diversity in menu items is reflective in their breakfast, brunch and lunch menus.  One is never left without a choice!  A personal favorite for breakfast is \"The Tri-fecta\", which includes two eggs cooked to order, choice of thick-sliced bacon, turkey sausage, seasoned turkey patty, or sausage link, and most importantly a \"light and airy\" made to order Belgian waffle sprinkled with powdered cinnamon sugar.  What is great about this particular meal, one can substitute a pancake instead of the waffle.  Their pancakes cure one's pancake craving.  First Watch standard pancakes are large sized, buttermilk with a most delicious and filling taste.  One can always count on their eggs being cooked perfectly to one's wishes; I am never disappointed in the cooking of my eggs.  The turkey sausage links are grilled golden, juicy and provide the right amount of meat taste accompaniment.  Sound decadent?  Rest assured First Watch provides full nutritional information, as well as substitutes for low-carb, gluten-free diets and those with allergies.  Regardless of your dietary needs, First Watch soars above the rest in Scottsdale, with their defined attention to service, food, quality and preparation.  First Watch declares and always follows through on their promise to you."}
{"text":"Came with a local who raved about this place and it did not disappoint.  I wish there were some in Las Vegas.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"First Watch is my absolute favorite. You can't go wrong with the Trifecta. Appropriately priced., not a greasy diner breakfast spot (although there is a time and place for such an establishment ;)), super friendly staff (very important for the bleary eyed morning crowd) and all around great food. It doesn't get any better in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Fave place because Kale Tonic & Morning Meditation. They are well blended fresh juices with no gross after taste. I order to go now for breakfast, long wait most weekend mornings. Waffle with blueberry jam & powdered sugar"}
{"text":"The first meal I got when I visited the family: a Chickichanga. It tasted the same as it did when I last had one. Thankfully that didn't change. The hole across the street formerly known as Cedar Center was a change but that's beside the point.  This Chickichanga thing consists of a chicken and chorizo buritto covered with sauce. The sauce isn't too flavorful but is a good accompaniment to the buritto and potatoes.   Usually when we would go here, there would be a long wait. However, we got seated right away. That's probably because it was a Wednesday rather than a weekend. However, it was nice to have a fresh breakfast after spending all night on various airplanes across the country."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything I've tried so far is great. The avocado toast is my fave, love that it includes eggs! Very filling! Their chia pudding, pancakes, and skillet hash's are also all delicious! The fresh preserves are amazing and the potatoes are a necessity as a side! Service is typically very sweet, prompt, and attentive as well!"}
{"text":"This place was jumpin', even at 1:30pm on a Friday afternoon. Doesn't anyone have to work in Westlake?  I was in town for my friend's wedding and came here for some post-rehearsal brunch with the other bridesmaids.  SERVICE: Fast and friendly.  PARKING:  This place is part of Crocker Place which has a free parkade. I don't think parking is such an issue in Cleveland, but us Californians just could not get over the free parking :)  FOOD: I ordered the Bacon and Onion Hash and it was soooo good. The perfect portion.  The bacon was crispy and savoury. The potatoes were perfectly al dente with just a little give, not too much. The onions were sweet and carmelized.  All of this was brought together with a bit of cheddar, not too cheezy.  It came with a side of fruit, which was great. Loved it. It also came with an English muffin which I could have done without, but it was nice and warm. Crispy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside.  CLEANLINESS: The kitchen is open and looks very clean. The bathrooms are clean, which is always a good thing.  This place reminds me a lot of Cora's, for those familiar with it."}
{"text":"This place is packed on the weekends for a reason - its awesome. Pretty much everything on the menu is just a little better than the way most restaurants make things. Take the breakfast sandwich, for instance. Every good breakfast place has a breakfast sandwich, but how many places use brioche bread, cage-free eggs and Gruyere cheese? That was a frickin delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"I always get great service and super tasty food when I come to this First Watch location. I find the iced coffee a little overwhelmingly sweet. The Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl is so good I have a hard time ordering anything else. People besides me have figured out how good they are, so it always seems to be busy. These are my huge complaints. In other words, I highly recommend this First Watch location.  And, my friend who I took recently to this First Watch is a rather picky eater and could be best discribed as a \"meat and potatoes\" kind of guy. He wound up getting the Ham & Gruyere Melt with Tomato Basil soup and he was really happy with it and his experience at the restaurant. So, that's two recommendations. My husband loves the place, too! So, three!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. Service is great. Johnny was my server today and he was quick, took my order right away, food was out quick, tasted really good and I was on my way. Thanks."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh food. Their skillet hash plates are fantastic. They are reasonably priced and have good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great wholesome breakfast!  Love the concept of First Watch especially unique considering they close at 2:30. Perfect balance for work home life. My favorite breakfast is the Avocado on Toast.  It's so fresh and filling without making you feel guilty for breakfast.   The lemon Ricotta pancakes are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Have had same server twice.  He was great.  My issue is I look up what I want to eat on-line at restaurant websites as I usually forget to bring reading glasses.  Today I ordered the Belgian waffle with fruit compote which, on the website, looked at least 1\" high with a bowl of compote as big as a soup bowl (not that I would have eaten or wanted that much but they were also fresh berries shown on the website and the compote i was served had 2 small unknown variety berries in a dark syrup).  In reality the waffle is 1/2\" high and the compote comes in a tiny tin with maybe 1 tblsp of compote.  I even asked the waiter where the compote was as I thought the tiny serving was maple syrup.  Another issue is the same for both breakfasts I had - both  were barely more than warm.  You have to eat fast if you don't want to eat cold food. The final issue is the table in front of me was being bussed and the diners had not used either the coffee cups or water glasses left on the table.  The cleaner moved the glass/coffee cups with her bare fingers by sticking her fingers inside the items to move them to the back of the table to be used by the next diner who sat there.  I really believe that is a sanitation faux pas and if the next diner knew someones fingers had been inside their drink cups they probably would not have liked it.  Maybe some additional training is required.  I don't believe the busser even thought about what she was doing could be potentially wrong."}
{"text":"After eating here 4-5 times, I think this place is a great breakfast option in Phoenix area! The last time I went, my food was cold when it came out to me, and the presentation wasn't good either (food was hanging over the plate). That said, the other times I've eaten here, it's been delicious! The servers are really friendly too! (I'm referring to the Scottsdale location near N Scottsdale road). I highly recommend the grits if you're a grits lover! Juices are super fresh, but I wish they offered more options. I also wish they had milk alternatives for their coffee. Overall, great breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Bomb dot.com place for breakfast. Waffles are amazing, pankakes dito. I'd also recommend the hash and eggs which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this new breakfast spot on 51 and I love it!! It's a chain but it doesn't feel like it, lots of cool options for breakfast and lunch. All the items are healthy and seemingly fresh made. It's a very cool concept that I imagine will be a model for others, open for breakfast and lunch, and that's it! Do one thing very good instead of a bunch of stuff half way. The menu has lots of healthy delish options, plus fresh made juices. We sampled the carrot orange ginger and it was excellent! I had the avocado toast with egg on homemade toast, it was very good My wife had the power bowl which all fresh made with fresh fruit, and a large banana nut muffin that had to be taken home. They also leave you a carafe of coffee at the table! I know there are at least three locations on the area, the one on 51 in Brentwood, one in Bridgeville, and one in Robinson!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love breakfast and they always have the stuff. The food is good, it is cheap, and much of it is healthy for you. They also keep the coffee and soda coming. You can get work done there if you need to. The wait staff are really nice as well."}
{"text":"Awesome - new HEALTHY foods..LOCAL FARMS.... Michelle - server was awesome... Def going back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, and I'd recommend it to anyone! The food is always fresh, prepared quickly, and the staff are always eager to help and friendly. It's not unusual for me to stop by a few times a week, and in all my time going here, I've always had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Our group of eight golfers had visited a First Watch location (near Hayden) a few days prior to venturing to Carefree's First Watch. Our Hayden's breakfast was outstanding. Hot tasty food, well prepared and served with flair and a personal touch. Our group was excited to go to Carefree's First Watch because of that experience. We were really disappointed. We were not seated promptly. We were stuck at a hastily constructed table configuration where one could only enter and exit from one end. The service was slow and ill timed. The meals were cold and poorly prepared and the portion size was abysmal. When asked why there was such a difference in portion size from another First Watch , our concerns were treated in a disrespectful and dismissive manner. When expressing our dissatisfaction after I had paid, I was again treated to the same disrespect from the manager. \"Have a nice day\" said in a snarky tone as I exited is all that I remember clearly from my experience. Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"3/15/2017  Yelp Review First Watch  Phoenix AZ 3215 E Camelback Rd, Phx AZ, 85018. ~0.7mi  (602)955-3447      Everyone likes to get up on Sunday mornings or any morning to cook or go out for a nice breakfast, after all it is the most important meal of the day. I have high expectations for breakfast, it should be light and enjoyable. The environment where you eat should be relaxing and delightful. First Watch instantly comes up in my head when I think of this place, a place that is delicious and hearty. To start with their coffee is always brewed freshly and their jam taste like fresh fruit. First Watch exceeded my expectations right off the bat from eating their food to how we were treated by the workers.        It started on a Sunday morning, my family and I normally like to get breakfast after a nice church service so we decided to try a place that had recently just opened down the street from our house which was First Watch, we didn't really know what to expect but the reviews were  exceptional. When we walked in there was a big crowd, but no matter how many people came in the host made sure to greet everyone with a smile on their face. I get very impatient, especially in the mornings but the wait was only about ten minutes and they provided coffee and water while waiting. When we got seated the waiter was also very pleasant. She served us water and told us to take our time on what we wanted. I never like the waiters that make you feel like you have to rush to pick what you want to eat.        First Watch not only had friendly and welcoming workers but the physical atmosphere of the place felt very warm and comfortable. The place wasn't big but it also wasn't so small that it was uncomfortable and cluttered. They had these chairs that I sunk into, I didn't want to get up from my seat, the color of the chairs and the tables fit the napkins very well. Everything about this place was great, especially the price. There's so many places that are good but unfairly overcharge you for food. There was three of us that day. I ordered the breakfast sampler which came with meat that had a lot of flavor and it also came with eggs and a waffle or pancakes. My mom and my sister each ordered different things. First Watch provides food that anyone can eat, starting from vegan to meat lover's food. It can be healthy or it can be sweet depending on what you're feeling like. The bill at the end came out to be under 40 dollars, which is great for three people and for the amount of food that we got. This place has great quality food with reasonable pricing.        Our waiter was very kind and very patient, after all we weren't the fastest people to pick what we wanted to eat. She always came to the table but not so much that we got annoyed by it. If you want great food that comes with great service, this place is recommended. Therefore I give First Watch 5 out 5 stars. The food was tasted great and not having to wait a long time was a plus!"}
{"text":"This place has major potential . Food taste really great . Healthy . Season well . Taste like it was made with love . But the wait for it is ridiculous . There was hardly anyone here . I wanted to get up and go back in the kitchen and figure out what is going on . Plus the food came out luke warm . Management how hard can this be ? Get more cooks . Something .after I ordered I waited for 30 mins . Smh"}
{"text":"This is my top 2 favorite breakfast/ brunch places. Everything on the menu is outstanding and they clearly know what good food is supposed to taste like. Great quality and portions as well. Cathy takes great care of us every week when we come in for lunch and takes all our special orders with care and a great smile to boot!"}
{"text":"If it's about food quality, this is the place. Everything from the syrup to the corned beef is outstanding. Even the chocolate used in the chocolate chip pancakes is top quality. The waffles are light and crisp and the pancakes are made from scratch. The potatoes are cooked and seasoned perfectly. It's not trendy and unique but definitely good fare."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at First Watch to enjoy  great food, great service and atmosphere.  Healthy choices for breakfast and lunch,  the Avocado Toast with egg was delicious; the bread was full of grains and nuts with chunks of Avocado and worth it's weight in gold.  I had to sample the  Biscuits with Turkey sausage gravy and it was amazing.  Natural juice drink called \"Morning Sunshine\" was great even without  the volka. We sampled 3 of the natural juices but was completely full and satisfied."}
{"text":"To say I was unimpressed is an understatement. We were seated to wait for an inside table... while waiting two people walked in who seemed to know the waitresses. They were seated before us and another party that had been waiting. All three parties were for two people. This was the beginning of a not so great experience. We were seated and waited for our waitress. I ordered my omelette and asked for egg whites & no cheese. I also asked to sub the toast for fruit and add a side of bacon. The order came out fairly quickly with a regular egg omelette and cheese in it. The fruit \"side\" was a dipping sauce cup with fruit... and the side of bacon was two slices. To be fair, I did not say one word about it because I was hungry and didn't want to wait. The egg whites and no cheese was a preference not a allergy issue. Everything was really good taste wise and my friend enjoyed her food very much. Then the bill came... that side of bacon was noted as \"Add meat 2 @ 1.49\". I asked the waitress if that was correct and if it really was 1.49 per slice or bacon. She said \"Yes, I know crazy right? It's 1.49 per slice of bacon. I added it as an addition rather than a side so it's actually cheaper for you, a real side is over 5 dollars.\" I just nodded and said, \"Ok, just making sure...\" She then continued to say, \"Well... I hope I rang that up right, I mean I don't mind if I rang it up cheaper for you.\" I was just so disappointed and very perplexed at that point. They did ask me the classic how was everything when I went to pay, but I just could not begin to have the conversation because of how frustrated I was. As much as I want to like the place I absolutely will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here at 11 am on a Wednesday and was delightfully surprised! I live around the corner so I have been here before. I stopped coming here on the weekends because the wait is normally outrageous, but I learned today that it's a pleasant experience on weekdays!   My order:  I got \"The Traditional\".  - Two Eggs over easy: These were done perfectly. They were still hot, which is much appreciated. Nothing is worse than cold eggs over easy. - Seasoned Potatoes: These were good. I usually like my breakfast potatoes on the more well done side. These were less crispy than I would have ideally liked, but they still had some crispy edges. So I enjoyed them. - Whole grain \"artisan\" toast: I laughed at the menu when it said \"artisan\" toast, being that this is a huge chain. But it really did not disappoint. The bread really elevated it from a normal, boring breakfast to a more delicious experience! Even if you don't like whole grain, I recommend this bread. Tasty.  - Fruit: This is not part of \"The Traditional\", which normally comes with some type of meat. Our waitress was great and when I said \"no meat\", she offered this up instead. It was some melon, watermelon and pineapple. All fresh cut.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience! I don't drink coffee or anything like that, so I think my meal was 8-10$. Not that bad for a breakfast.  I will definitely return! There's nothing super unique about it but it was clean, bright, and the food was solid! I will only come on weekdays though when it is a stress-free ambiance. I also wouldn't wait more than 10/15 minutes to eat here, but I'll come back."}
{"text":"We visited this place two months ago and had a horrendous experience. The wait was over 40 minutes on a saturday morning. We were sat by the hostess and waited 10 minutes to be greeted by the server. The food we ordered took more than 30 minutes to arrive. When it finally arrived, the food was incorrect and the server seemed genuinely uninterested in her job. We had to ask the manager to step in and help with missing items. The only reason I rate this place with 2 stars is because after we had complained about our experience, the manager comped the meal. Line staff needs to be trained more, there needs to be more help on the weekends in the kitchen and also the dining room."}
{"text":"It's all about the food  This was our first visit to this First Watch, and we had a nice brunch with great service. Our server was attentive, without being intrusive and our meals were both tasty.   The restaurant was busy, however, the wait wasn't very long.  Once seated our drinks were brought quickly.   Everyone tried something different.  I ordered pancakes with warm syrup, eggs, and bacon, and it was delicious. The bacon was crispy and pancakes were light and fluffy.  All in all a great dining experience for breakfast.  We will remember First Watch as one of our favorite brunch stops."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for breakfast. I had a bacon avocado omelette, and it was awesome. Everyone who I was with loved their meals. We will be back."}
{"text":"So happy to find healthy food in AZ!  I like to eat clean and this was not that pseudo healthy type stuff. Real, good, food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I loved my first experience at First Watch! As someone trying to eat a more nutrient filled/balanced diet... First Watch is perfect. I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach, tomatoes, and feta. My fiancé ordered biscuit and turkey gravy with eggs. Can't go wrong here; the entire menu is pretty healthy. Went on a Friday morning and was in and out in about 30 or 35 minutes. Service was wonderful!    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here and it would have been really good if the window had a shade, blind or screen to block the sun from our table. I asked if we could be moved to another table, but my request was completely ignored. I had to wear my sunglasses and almost fainted from the heat. The food was tasty, service was okay considering how busy it was and I will go back and try again."}
{"text":"Look it's not the best , but I really like it . breakfasts are good, coffee good, specialty juice much better then good. That's right, try the juice."}
{"text":"I think First Watch is really overpriced for what it is. I had the traditional breakfast that came with 2 eggs, bacon, English muffin and potatoes. I always order eggs over medium and I've never had them cooked properly at first watch. I got over easy watery eggs today. The bacon was crispy and delicious though. I just think $8.50 for average breakfast food is too much."}
{"text":"Ask for Carlos. He was awesome. The pumpkin pancakes were terrific. I had had a bad experience last time and I told Carlos and he made it great. And did I mention the pumpkin  pancakes?  I almost didn't come back but so glad I did."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Healthy menu with lots of choices. Fresh juices as well. Great staff, very friendly, and the waitress Talia is a great asset to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Hooray for finding a dog-friendly patio!!  The servers were excellent, knowledgeable and kind.  There is space to wait for a table outside and the hostess is great about not forgetting you!  Coffee is perfect and the waitresses are good about refilling the carafes (take a to go cup!).  I've never had a bad experience at this chain."}
{"text":"Good food with fast, friendly service.  I like the health menu options.  You've got to try the juices! I really like the new decor too."}
{"text":"Monterey Club and chops! The sandwich was okay but the salad chops were delicious and refreshing with beans, avocado, corn, tomato and a healthy mix of greens and chicken!   The shrimp and grits were okay it came with a side of bread, shrimp and the grits were okay... the tomatos werent cut small enough though it was a ball of tomato which was kind if overwhelming to eat and under the grits they had a sort of porridge which i liked  Its more of a fancy breakfast and brunch place rather than a close to home breakfast place which made me a little disappointed but either way delicious"}
{"text":"Worst service when i came in here for lunch.  Cold food, 40min wait time, table that got there after us got their food first, waitress didnt ask how our food was, didnt say anything when taking our check... she knew what was up and didnt say anything. Great.  Im a server so if it were busy id understand but it wasnt... if shes new, management needs to step up their game and train their servers better, if shes not she gotta go ahha.  Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the North Hills. Fresh food. Fast service. And they have the No Wait app. I highly recommend the Elevated Egg Sandwich - it's delicious!! My husband, who doesn't go for the whole egg white, quinoa bowl thing, shoots for the Trifecta every time (eggs, pancake or waffle, and bacon or sausage) and never leaves hungry."}
{"text":"This was a great option for us on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The staff are very \"family\" friendly and laid back at this location.  I had \"The Works\" Omelette and Carlos had the \"Frittata Rustica\" Omelette.  The sour cream dollop given on the top of \"The Works\" was a hilariously stingy, but welcome addition to a great omellete.  The Rustica was also pretty good.  Both servings of potato and toast were a bit dry (yeah- I tried both!), but didn't take away from our enjoyment of the Omellettes.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Second visit to this location  really, really good food with a lovely design. It just feels homey and it's very clean. It brightly lit with families all around.   Today I had the French toast. It was huge, filling and good. Just right for a rainy day. What made my meal?  The perfectly brewed hot coffee. Typically breakfast places don't have great coffee to me anyway. This was different. The coffee was dark, rich, and the temperature was perfect. I had two delightful cups. 5 stars for the coffee!    Service was so good, that I hardly noticed my server. I know that sounds odd, but he was like one of the stealth stage hands you can barely see at the plays. They are moving around taking care of business and they do it so swiftly and expertly you barely notice them working. Had my check in no time and a quick smile from my server.   Check out was fast and easy. There was a big sign in the waiting area saying customers could check in with the app lessening the wait. Cool! This place is a find. Definitely putting it on the dining out rotation."}
{"text":"We LOVE First Watch and frequent the one at Summit Mall.  Unfortunately, we have not had as good of an experience at the one at Portage Crossing.  A couple of times have been average, but not the last time.  We tried checking in on the NoWait app like we normally do, but because we had a party of 9 the app said to call the restaurant directly.  We proceeded to do that and were told that we had to use the app.  Several phone calls later and we arrived to be seated about 20 minutes after getting there.  All seems good except that we were seated in a side room and the tables were already put together from a previous large party.  There were crayons all over the floor as well as jam and butter on the tables and the floor below us.  We asked for it to be cleaned up and the server asked us if we meant right then or later.  Huh???  They eventually cleaned it (about 15 minutes later).  Before cleaning it the busser told us he would get to it when he got to it.   We were about 5 minutes into our meals and a large group began filtering in and standing around our table.  Apparently there was a birthday party scheduled in the side room, and they had seated us about 20 minutes before it was to start.  Some of that party had to wait for us to finish our meal.  But how awkward for us while eating and for them since they had made reservations. We will continue to go to the Summit Mall one, but doubtful that we will go to the one at Portage Crossing again."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic here, we got a server named Sarah, my cousins new her from xoming here themselves. It seemed to be busy but qe got seated in fairly timely manner. While we were waiting for  the rest of our group to get there they brought out our coffee and water.     We had ordered the bacon app which was really good and tasty, if you dont like or cant handle spicy dont get the bacon. The majority of our table got the chicichanga, including myself, it was amazing. My wife got the Floridian(fruits) french toast with maple syrup. Grandpa got one of the traditional meals with Belgium waffles, he gobbled that up.    Overall great experience a very friendly and inviting atmosphere, definitely a repeat customer for me and the wife."}
{"text":"Spotted this place on Yelp, and it was even convenient!  Looking for breakfast after a hard session at the gym.  I liked that the menu had items other than the usual breakfast fare.   I really don't much like breakfast food because it's always the same (eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, pancakes in some combination).  They had all that here, but some variations that looked promising!  We ordered seasonal chimichurri hash, acai (drink), and artisan grain pancakes.  Syrup was extra.  Well, OK...not exactly.  They have a crap syrup that is included (the server said it was \"like Log Cabin\").  Really?  Why would a place featuring such interesting choices as chimichurri hash feature some fake syrup product??  But for $1.29 you can purchase actual maple syrup (in a small bottle you can take with you).  As you can guess, we got the actual maple syrup.  The acai was actually nice.  I'm not usually a fan, but this is a mixed beverage of some sort and it was pretty good.  My wife really liked it.  The pancakes were good.  Can't really say \"special\", but good.  It did seem they left one side cooking a tad too long as it has a slight crunch to it.  But the flavor was fine, especially with actual real syrup.  The flavor of the chimichurri was good, but not well distributed.  The chicken and chimichurri sauce were both concentrated in specific areas.  So the first few bites were just potatoes.  Then I hit the sauce more towards the middle as well as chicken which was in about 2/3 of the dish.  I just happened to start in the 1/3 where it wasn't.  They should probably make a bit more effort to get a better distribution of the ingredients so the diner gets the full flavor from start to finish.  Once I realized I stirred it up a bit on my own to spread it around better.  Not fatal, but just a lack of attention to detail, in my opinion.  Service was good and friendly with appropriate attention.  I can see coming back sometime."}
{"text":"Best avocado toast ever! Highly recommend this place. They have lots of delicious & healthy options. Their cucumber honeydew juice was really good too! Great prices!"}
{"text":"To me the food is bordering \"institutional\". It's a notch or two above Denny's. We have some 5 Star breakfast options in the area like Vincent's Bistro, and La Grande Orange. Coming soon we'll have Matt's Big Breakfast.   Quite honestly, I don't understand how a place like First Watch will survive the competition. On a positive note, the decor is quite nice and makes for a decent place to meet for a business conversation with a safe, but nothing special meal.   Sorry First Watch; I was hoping that you'd make a better addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice over a  long period of time and although we prefer  independent breakfast focused quality  businesses we had to get to the airport so we stopped here at 11:30, seemed very quiet. Our waiter was not trained or qualified to be a server. Nice person, tried his best though just isn't ready to wait tables by himself.   There are no prices on many of the beverages on the menu, huh?  Does management not realize there are no prices on most of the beverages on the menu? Menu says \"fresh squeezed Juices\" when asked if the juices are really fresh squeezed, the waiter said no. He also did not know the prices, he guessed wrong. So if it says fresh squeezed, you should be  squeezing oranges. This is a big lie from many restaurants as anyone can buy fresh squeezed juice from suppliers and its pasteurized, come clean, please !!! Charge what you have to or just say \"Juice\". The food was tasty though the pecan dressing on the salad was so heavy and flattened the greens, it should be all automatically on the side. Thats what customers want.  The bread for the turkey sandwich was stale. Store bought bread, really?, so average. This is a large restaurant and sits mostly empty during the week and its the only game in town for full service breakfast. We left at 1pm, very quiet, eery.  Did not see a manager ever, I suggest to begin straightening out these yelp reviews, you begin showing appreciation for what guests you do have, or you will be mediocre forever. Stop by and touch every table while guests are present, show appreciation, fix issues immediately and stay  visible and available. This restaurant is big and feels awkward when business is soft.  Solutions: Management needs to \"own the business\" You are open only from 7-2:30, be amazing ! Touch every table, ask good questions, be there when people leave, so there is a source to sound off, if needed Sense of urgency to maintain perfect service levels Particion dining roof off so appears to be smaller and perception is busier, successful Offer unique, high quality specials on big menu chalkboard  you have which currently has no message. Revise menu's , add prices, clean it up Comp  a unique offering such as a small pastry basket to  each table as they arrive to have with coffee and while waiting for their food, differentiate yourself and be consistent.  I do wish you well."}
{"text":"We used to love this place... but then they rebranded themselves & everything went to shit. It was such a go to spot for us that our family has given it a few chances since the change & it's just terrible. Omelettes now are just an egg folded around some food. Their basic breakfast items are nothing exciting, just basic biting bland. The soup options fave been Campbell's quality + we've tried the sandwiches to discover they are bland & less than exciting too. This place used to look pretty darn busy any day of the week; don't know why they went messing with a good thing."}
{"text":"Not impressed, food looked like it was thrown all around the plate before we got it. It also had zero taste. Overpriced as well for what we got."}
{"text":"We go for brunch every Sunday...  Normally to smaller \"home town\" diners but today we tried First Watch.   It was pretty good.   Everything about our experience their was good.  We were greater and sat right away.   Waitress was pleasant with a good balance of work and chat.  The order came out in a reasonable amount of time and correct.   In the end the food looked and tasted great.   I had the key west creppeggs.  It was a mix between an omlette and a crepe.   Tasty.  Wife and kids were also satisfied with their meal.   A little more expensive than other places we have gone to...   But still within the budget."}
{"text":"A great place to have a wonderful brunch with family and friends, especially on a sunny weekend day. The food was well-prepared and the service was great. My wife and I enjoyed our time together over a delicious fall-themed brunch, fresh-squeezed juice (I tried the Grapefruit juice and it was tasty), and slices of bacon covered by maple syrup. We will be back there very soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate breakfast at First Watch for the first time. I ordered the bacon and onion hash and it was delicious. My wife really liked her food as well.   If I were reviewing on food alone, I would definitely give them 5 stars, but the service could have been better. Our server was polite but after she brought our check she never came back to our table. All we wanted was a refill on our iced teas but we nearly had to throw something at her to get her attention.  Prices were a little on the high side for breakfast but not too bad for the area and considering the quality of the food.  The restaurant and restrooms appeared to be clean."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. All their food is pre seasoned  waiter was very sympathetic and apologized many times that the majority of their food is premade the day before and it is seasoned with their season and sauces.worst"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see First Watch in Phx.  Apparently First Watch bought out The Good Egg.   I love their breakfast. The skillet hash is my favorite. The banana oats pancakes are delicious. I'm not a fan of the Benedict's. I'm quite picky when it comes to that but that's because that's my \"go to\" breakfast option and I've had a lot of great ones. The reason I don't enjoy it is because it's on a loaf style bread, which I'm not a fan of. The staff is friendly and the pricing is not bad at all. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this place and we absolutely loved it! We are definitely coming back, it's perfect to go have breakfast or lunch, the food it's delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"We generally have good service. The food is always good and fresh. Waiters (like any restaurant) can sometimes be a little busy, but usually at least stop by and ask if everything is okay. On occasion it might taken several minutes after we are finished eating to get our check, but at least we are on a full stomach, LOL. Nice little place, always clean."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Sunday brunch.  Barrett Jackson is happening so everything is slammed. For first watch this was no problem. We were seated in 5 min. Started with million dollar bacon...sweet maple and cayenne pepper. So freaking good. The whole grain toast with my scramble was perfect. My wife had a Belgian waffle with cherry compote and warmed maple syrup. All so good. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't be FOOLED by the nice well kept appearance of the interior design and the clean, crisp look of the menu you'll be handed.  It's a cover for the sub-standard food and service.  Breakfast is the easiest to make and serve yet, my eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon were cold.  Our server didn't do the usual 5-10min follow-up to make sure I was happy with my meal...so I just sat there...when server did come back, she didn't remove my meal from the bill.  STAY AWAY from this place as this has happened to me on a number of occasions.  I won't be back...they wasted my precious time and money."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited First Watch this morning. There was a 30 minute wait but we decided to sit outside and enjoy the weather..we were seated after about 15-20 minutes. It took a while for our waitress to come greet us, but it was also nice because we had time to review the menu and order drinks and meals at the same time. I tried the kale tonic juice, it was delicious. It had kale, apple, cucumber and lemon, I believe. I ordered the avocado toast which was 2 pieces of toast with smashed avocado, sea salt and a lemon  wedge to squeeze on top. It also came with eggs, totaling 8.99. I thought that was a bit expensive, however it filled me up and was very tasty. I also ordered a side of their potatoes for 2.99 because I thought I would still be hungry. I didn't even need them because the toast and eggs were so filling! My husband had the brisket hash, which was also very good. It had potatoes, eggs, roasted onions, kale, maple bbq sauce and of course brisket. Our total for avocado toast (8.99), kale tonic (3.99), side of potatoes (2.99), and brisket hash (9.99), we paid 28.61 plus a $5 tip. Only downfall was that our waitress didn't really come to our table at all to check in and our drinks were empty for majority of the meal. She was nice though and it was very busy so I understand! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. The location is just the right amount of city and Scottsdale but doesn't have the college kids running every where.   It has such an original atmosphere and the service is fantastic. Our food was warm and so healthy. I'm no vegan but I'm okay with health but this tasted like dessert and was full of nutrition.   So thankful to have found a cute breakfast joint in the perfect area! Parking is super convenient too!!  Special thanks to Shelby and Karliy! They're great! (Please excuse any miss spelled names or words, I'm on my phone!)"}
{"text":"I guess avocado toast is a thing. This was my first experience and I love love it.  I had one of their specials a green tea pancake which was really good. I ordered fresh maple syrup which came in a tiny personalized bottle. I would rank this place as one of the top breakfast places in town. Also great service. The hostess was particularly helpful. So thanks for that."}
{"text":"Although it's not local and it's a chain, this First Watch location is a great place to eat. My fiance and I go about twice a month and not once have we had a bad experience. Keep in mind, it's a small place... BUT you can make a reservation before you leave so that when you get to the restaurant you won't be waiting very long.  All around: Good place, normal breakfast foods, and it's close to everything."}
{"text":"First time I have ever had avocado toast. I guess it's a thing and now it's one of my favorites. Really enjoyed this place and can't wait to try it again. Everyone was supper nice from the hostess to the server to the district manager I think it was who going around refilling drinks and checking on people. I also had pancakes with real maple syrup it came in a tiny bottle so good"}
{"text":"Really good with good healthy options! I had the chikichimi which was wonderful! Came with fruit to finish tha job whaaaaaaaaaattttt"}
{"text":"For as long as I am a female, I will not return to the first watch on Dobson Rd in Mesa...I have been coming her for several months my husband and I enjoy our waitress that we always seem to get she very friendly and accommodating little curly head girl name starts with a M especially when the COLD food seems to come out EVERYTIME, but my post is about the RUDE UNFRIENDLY hostess ERICA I have never been treated so bad in an establishment I am paying to be served ERICA is her name long black ponytail I will not return..I will find somewhere else to have breakfast/lunch..... and the 2 stars is for my waitress"}
{"text":"When we visit Phoenix or the Valley, this is one of our favorite breakfast spots.  We've also dined at 2 of their other locations and they are equally excellent.  The food is fresh, innovative with healthier choices available along side the classics. The service is always very good and consistent.  Their juices are all freshly squeezed and wonderfully tasty. I've never had even a slightly below average meal here.  It's always good."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of other of their locations but this one is hands down my favorite.  It has a little bit more of an edge to it ambience wise and it's always hopping especially for breakfast on the weekends.  The food is fresh and delightfully good all the time."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier with my first experience to First Watch! My fiancé and I both had incredible dishes- the brisket mash and the healthy turkey egg white omelette. The coffee was better than Starbucks and the prices are fair. So excited it opened close to home, will frequent First Watch!"}
{"text":"The food was par for the course of breakfast. The wait staff was weird and slightly unpleasant. I had a few questions about the juices and preparedness of the food and I was met with a lot of attitude. Basically most of their \"food\" is not made in house. Which for a breakfast place I was surprised. Not planning on returning unless physically forced to."}
{"text":"I'm a big first watch fan.  This is typically a very busy location on the weekends so I tend to go a little earlier than the rush (7:30/8ish). The staff is always very friendly and welcoming especially Sarah R.  My perfect weekend starts with a fresh morning meditation juice and avocado toast!  Another great thing about this location is the NOWAIT APP !! Download it add your email, how many people in your party and get in line from home. Just check in when you get there!"}
{"text":"I ate here once before and the food was ok but the service was VERY slow. I came back a 2nd time and brought the whole family thinking that the service would be better... I was so wrong. When the waitress took our order, we explained to her that my wife had celiac disease and could not have ANY gluten. She told us it was problem. 45 MINUTES  later the waitress finally brought our order. When she served my wife's plate, it had 2 large slices of toast on it. We called the waitress and told her again about my wife's severe gluten allergy and that they needed to remake her food since it had toast on it. The waitress apologized and said she would take care of it. 20 minutes later she delivered the new plate... with another 2 large slices of toast on top. This time we called the manager because we had now been waiting for well over an hour (not including the 90 minute wait to be seated) and explained once again about the gluten allergy and how it could possibly send my wife to the hospital and that they needed to be more careful. The manager apologized once again and said that he would take care of it. When the waitress brought the meal for the 3rd time... guess what??? That's right! There was 2 slices of toast on top again!!! We couldn't believe it. By this time my wife was starving and decided to remove the toast herself and proceeded to eat because her blood sugar levels were dropping fast and was getting close to passing out (not to mention she was getting a little hangry). Unfortunately for her, this was a big mistake because by the time we got home, my wife became very sick and literally could not get out of bed for 4 DAYS!!! The migraine headaches were so severe we almost had to take her to the emergency room on several occasions.   I will NEVER go back to First Watch again! The wait staff and kitchen staff are extremely careless and lazy  and DO NOT CARE if you have any food allergies or not. There are other choices."}
{"text":"I like the lunch better than the breakfast at \"First Watch\", which is a bit ironic I suppose. Perhaps it should be named Second Watch?  But on to what I do like... The \"Not Guilty Your Honor\" veggie wrap is good. It comes with a side of hummus, fruit and potatoes. Big meal! The \"Burrito Vera Cruz\" breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Vera Cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise. I've never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty! Mango iced tea is good! And they'll give you some to go if you ask!  Somethin about the potatoes just doesn't cut it for me though... And as I mentioned earlier, the breakfast just isn't my favorite. I just don't dig their omelets much.  Sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon.  Note: If you're vegan, order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese. Get a side of salsa too."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate their food but I never got any.  I went in and placed a to go order meanwhile about half the restaurant was empty and there was a large group of people waiting to be sat.  After 20 minutes I asked to have my order checked and was told they were just putting it in.  Gee do you think having somebody check on it helped my order to get placed? So I left to get food elsewhere.  I called the manager after I left and was given the excuse that there were people ahead of me and they did not forget to put the order in.... 20 minutes for food in a breakfast place?  I am sorry but that is a lie and shame on you for making excuses like that.  Your host went back to check on the pocket ticket and they realized they had screwed up, I worked in restaurants when I was younger and I know how it works.  First time customer and not likely to ever be back.  I drove over to over easy on gilbert and Warner, they were also very packed, even more so than first watch.  I placed the exact same order and had my food 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"I've been to every first watch location and this will be the only one I go to from now on. I had some of the best service here and the employees are so friendly and inviting. It felt like I was relaxing with friends.   You must try the avocado toast there! And their breakfast potatoes are amazing.   Will absolutely be back for brunch again soon!"}
{"text":"This review covers the Ancala location at Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and Via Linda Street. I felt the staffing level was inadequate for 10:00 am on a Tuesday morning. It appeared to me that there were only two servers. I ordered coffee but just could not drink it, it was much too strong, tasted burnt and was only luke warm. Perhaps it was old, another result of under staffing? My order for Eggs Benedict Florentine was okay, I enjoyed the ciabatta roll, avocado, and tomato, however I think it would have been better with steamed, or sauteed spinach rather than the raw veggie alone. While I understand the healthy choice concept here, salad with vinaigrette dressing accompanying Eggs Benedict is just a little different. Too early for tart vinegar taste. Perhaps adding some fruit, such as strawberry might add some flair to it? In summary, a very mediocre experience at a rather high price."}
{"text":"I love how they use cage free eggs & everything is locally grown at this spot! The restaurant is clean, spacious, & filled with tons of healthy options!   I ordered: -avocado toast w/ a side of scrambled eggs -kale tonic juice   One of the best avocado toast I ever had! It comes with a slice of lemon for you to squeeze over the avocado. Don't let the swerving size fool you, it's extremely filling! I couldn't finish the second slice of bread. They also give a generous amount of avocado on each slice. The kale tonic green juice was extremely refreshing! It's a must try!   Customer service was great! She was there when we needed something & she even split up out bill individually without us asking!!! That certainly made it a lot easier for us since we had a big group.   When you're done with your meal, you just take the bill to the front & pay there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and keep going back for the food but beware. The service is sub-par.  I've sat without anyone even coming to acknowledge me for 15 minutes at a time and just when I get up to leave they jump up to serve me.  There are a lot of servers standing around but they are not quick to wait on the customers.  The good news is the food arrives quickly and it's very good which is what keeps me going back. Just be prepared to be patient."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their tonics are refreshing and they really get you going in the morning. The food all local and politically correct but in the right way. Local produce, meats and eggs and not making it a big deal just part of who they are as an establishment. Their toast is hearty. Their seasonal menus also spice things up too. I go two or three times when I am in  Phoenix. Generally getting a variety of items off the menu. So far all has been exceptional.   A must go!"}
{"text":"I love the menu! So many wonderful and creative options and my mouth drools over the eggs Benedict. This is why its so sad when staffing and service issues gets in the way of this great food! I was seated at a dirty tAble with water and coffee mugs from the previous patrons. The table was unwiped/sanitized. It took a long time for our server to get around to us so we ordered drinks and food altogether. She cleared away previous patrons cups when she brought our drinks because i asked if the coffee caraffe was for us. She never brought the condiment caddy so i went and grabbed one for myself as i like cream with my coffee. Food was delivered to us by another waitress and the order was wrong. I pointed it out instantly which was a good thing because our meal was done by the time the waitress made it back to see if we liked our food. The food was really yummy. Its always such a bummer what an impact bad service has on a rare and special meal out during precious time off with my loved ones!"}
{"text":"I've started with coffee and kale tonic was amazing. Then I had the healthy turkey, I recommend this as a great healthy meal. Place was crowded but was seated right away. Parking was great and everyone greeted me upon my arrival. Overall great location in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"First time at this location and the food was awesome as usual. This is my go-to for breakfast and lunch. The pancakes and waffles are excellent and the sandwiches are really good too. So much to choose from, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this one short and sweet.  This restaurant has GOOD FOOD.    It's not what I would call fancy or gourmet but it's that kind of place that you know you and your group is not going to be disappointed.  We have been there a couple of times and there is always a wait but never too long and it is always worth it!  The HASH breakfast's are my personal favorite and everything about them tastes 100% homemade.  If you are one of those who really likes hash but asks if it's canned because you don't like the kinda salty mushed stuff with little tiny chopped potatoes,  Well you are going to LOVE this place because it is truly homemade and well portioned and full bodied with great flavor!  There is always more than enough food to go around; we are big boys and like to eat and start our vacation days with good food for breakfast and have never been disappointed here.  When ever in Phoenix I think we eat here at least once..... we always try new places because we are adventurous but First Watch is the place that comes to mind if there is any question or if you've had a bad meal you always think, I should have just eaten there....  I would also say they are the masters of comfort food!  Good food time and again that you can count on.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Came back again today for Mother's Day Brunch.  Everything was great. My Mom and family loved it. The wait wasn't long to be seated.  Lisa was an awesome server. Her beautiful friendly spirit helped to make our meal that much better. I will be back the next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning and it was amazing. The food and service were great.  We had a short wait but the host was on top of things so people weren't waiting too long. I will definitely recommend this restaurant and dine here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic !!! I had the eggs Benedict made for a very healthy breakfast the coffee was very good.. the service was great as well I will definitely be coming back loved that hey had many vegetarian options on the menu lots of healthy things as well"}
{"text":"Nice, respectable breakfast place near Encanto park.  It has a basic, chain brunch place feel, but with the friendly servers, somehow it seemed a bit more homey. Seats are basic wooden booths and the inside seems a bit cooler and darker than you'd expect for a bright Phoenix morning.   The menu is basic breakfast fare and I had a version of the Denver omelette with english muffins on the side. There was also a potato side that came with it: for the life of me, I believe it was homefries, but I'm not 100%. Obviously it wasn't too memorable, but I thought everything here was at least average.  Prices were reasonable and they dropped a coffee canteen at my table (and even refilled it when I had drank the whole thing) for easy access.   So, not a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life, but there won't be any nightmares here either......"}
{"text":"Great breakfast options!  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious. Very clean establishment great look."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Cute atmosphere. Great food and lovely coffee. Good food for the price."}
{"text":"I think carbs are evil but I took a break for this First Watch breakfast. Our party of 3 got a few different items, but I ordered an extra plate of Lemon Ricotta Pancakes to share. They are delicious. We all enjoyed them very so much. They come with lemon curd and fresh strawberries. They barely needed syrup. Our server was Roman and he was very professional and friendly. This location has plenty of parking. Overall a good experience. First Watch has interesting menu options and ingredients seem high quality and fresh."}
{"text":"Flew in from Mn daughter lives here we have home in Verrado she couldn't stop talking about this ola d so we went ok it is incredible.  Great service great food Baja Turkey Burger knocked it out of the park. Cudos to the entire team love the place, people and food. Only 4 star one in our party didn't like her meal but I ate hers also and it was great."}
{"text":"I feel like I always order the wrong thing here but I have been like four times and alwass not like my meal.  Prices are not great either.  Service is good and it is always clean."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the portion size. There are too many other good breakfast options in that area to waste time at First Watch. Nice staff, just not worth the price."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite breakfast and brunch spot! All the food is very fresh and locally made everyday. I also love the atmosphere with the rustic farm house feel.   We ordered the pot roast hash and the eggs Benedict and both dishes were amazing! The roast is to die for and the fresh fruit is delicious! We will definitely be coming back - maybe everyday"}
{"text":"Except for the annoying birds ready to pounce.... I loved the patio vibe and open-air feel while enjoying our delicious breakfast.  I had the Floridian French toast and my husband ordered the regular one.  Mine came topped with fresh kiwi, strawberry and banana slices and was scrumptious!  It was served with a side fruit compote ...that was a bit tart but tasty.  I spent extra and ordered real maple syrup!  Well worth it.  My husband's French toast was sprinkled with confectioners sugar and also had the compote on the side. He opted to forgo the syrup and just spread the compote on top.  Great meal, excellent service.  Will definitely return!  One last note - we used a BOGO mailer. They actually gave us credit for the higher of the two entrees!  Nice way to welcome new customers.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super delicious every time I go. We love to sit outside on the patio. Wait staff always very friendly and helpful. And the pricing is fair. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up. Thank you."}
{"text":"Well, after ordering our meal Sunday, it took \"48\" minutes to get our meals.  I don't believe it was the waiters fault as the meal was warm, and EVERYONE was getting their meals VERY LATE!  Additionally....$5 for 4 slices of THIN bacon?!?!  I could have bought a pound!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"First time eating at First Watch and it won't be our last! Yummy! And great service and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Wow! My buddy and I went here for a final meal before he gets married later today. It was INCREDIBLE. The service was wonderful and the food was the perfect balance of healthy and filling. I had the a chorizo pepper omelette. Delicious! I'm from out of town, but next time I'm here we are coming back."}
{"text":"If you gotta be stuck downtown, you might as well eat here.  They have some different breakfast options if you are are trying to eat junk or eat healthy.  If I am visiting the nearby hospital I will eat healthier but if I am heading downtown for an event, you know I am going comfort food all the way!  I do not like that if I am sitting there with a friend they bring me my bill and will not come back to the table to refill my water or my tea.  It feels like they are expecting you hurry and leave at times."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while and finally headed in for lunch today.   I had the 1/2 sandwich 1/2 salad combo with the ham & gruyere sammy with the chicken avocado chopped. I tend to be an optimist and tend to find the good in anything. But these were both seriously delicious!  I got my sandwich fix (sandwiches are my one of my favorite foods) while being able to feel somewhat healthy with a small side salad that wasn't over dressed.  I will definitely be going back to try more menu items"}
{"text":"I liked the food but wish they were open later  There's a long line on weekends   Personally I'd never return but mostly because it had a cold feel and was rather loud.   I'd just as soon go to a drive thru to get food"}
{"text":"Never coming back. We waited a total of one and a half hours to get seated and to get our food. Our server was not attentive at all. One of our entrees came out wrong, no follow up from the server or the manager. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Visiting from the northwest for a convention, it's always a little scary finding a place to eat breakfast.   This place did NOT disappoint!!   Party of five (used to good dining) came for breakfast, seated right away.  We were assured by John, the waiter, it would get a lot busier and by the time we left, they were right!  We ordered the avocado toast as an appetizer even though it comes as a meal in itself.  It was the best I have ever tasted.  I ordered eggs Benedict with the salmon instead of ham - it came on ciabatta which had the perfect crunch to it.  Frittata salmon was good, as well as one of the skillets, the Healthy Turkey (an omelette), and the Elevated Egg Sandwich.   Salad came with most of the meals except the Skillet and while surprising, they were lovely to have in The morning.   Sometimes you leave feeling heavy and bloated but this morning I feel ready to face the day!!  Good show, Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is very nice location and a great place to share breakfast with friends. Nice patio adjacent a very spacious dining room.   I like both the menu and the food presentations. Lots of little extras make it unique and sets them aside from other more high volume places.  Great staff and the place is spotless! Located in a very posh area of town. Grab your paper and catch up on outside world or bury your phone and the paper and just enjoy life for a change! #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere receive 4 stars. The service and the people get 1 Star. The staff was unfriendly and inattentive. We waited 5 minutes to pay. Had to flag someone down. Nobody seemed like they wanted to be there. If you can get passed the staff, the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite for a fresh and filling weekend breakfast. Everything is prepared well and to order. And it's great to have alternative meat options for people who shun red meat (think chicken and turkey sausages). The kids swear by the French toast and the husband loves the assorted omelets. Me? The basic eggs, potatoes, turkey sausage and thick slices of buttery whole grain toast. To drink? With the arrival of summer temps, don't skip the cold brew iced coffee. I just wish they were buy one get one free! (Umm. They'd both be for me.)"}
{"text":"Great food, slightly overpriced for what you get. Our service was very slow but that's because our waitress seemed to be serving half the Resturant so not entirely her fault."}
{"text":"I love this place! The restaurant is really nice and they have great healthy options, like the avocado toast which is delicious!"}
{"text":"Healthy options for eating out. Tastes amazing and has great juices as well. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley.   I've been coming here more consistently lately as my sit down breakfast spot. I feel like a get a good balanced meal, and the juices they make are delcious."}
{"text":"Great food options with great tastes. Both breakfast and lunch options are fantastic. I like the day glow and kale tonic juices. Avocado toast with eggs and bacon on top, breakfast tacos, chikachonga, the classic eggs Benedict and the roast beef and havarti sandwich (old beefeater) are good. For the sandwich, They have a horse radish sauce and they told me they got rid of the actual horse radish. I think my server was just lazy and didn't want to look for it. I like to use both. Service is generally friendly and quick too."}
{"text":"I use to go to FirstWatch once a week....and enjoyed it. The last time I went... I personally saw a girl working there who handled cash from a customer....picked up dirty dishes from a table...then went to the back and put bread in a toaster by hand...she never washed her hands or anything...and she did not use gloves of any kind...it was disgusting...I called them when I got home and of course the poor excuse of a manager never called me back.  This is a health violation...if this is what they do when the customer can see ...just think what goes on out of view of the customer.  I was sitting at a table back by the half wall that lets you look into the kitchen.  Disgusting....I use to work at a resturant...and I know many of them follow all the health guidelines...it is not that difficult...most are just common sense. If you eat there enjoy the germs..."}
{"text":"I had the Cherry chicken quinoa power bowl. It was good! Staff is friendly. Prices are reasonable. Service is fast. The decor is a little drab but that is the only semi-negative thing. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was overall great  Pros: Delicious food Great tasting coffee Clean  Cons:  Long wait  Service was less than friendly"}
{"text":"Wonderful..\"meditation juice\"  is one of the best I have had as far as healthy juice choices! Tried the chicken chopped salad...fresh and light on the dresing! All the breakfast choices looked superb. Next I want to try the avocadoi toast"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy breakfast! We come here about once a week because it is so good! The service is always friendly and the food is great. It could be a littttle less expensive but it is worth it! I recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent breakfast or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast sandwich and it was amazing. Super filling and I'm pregnant! If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would. Also got the morning meditation juice and it was just what I needed. Have been looking for anything with turmeric in it lately and this had it. We will be returning definitely."}
{"text":"We only went there for breakfast, but it was great !! We especially liked the Parma Hash, omelets and they have amazing muffins Price is average."}
{"text":"Today was not my first visit to First Watch and this isn't my first review. Kenzie was our server today and she is amazing. Typically when you take children into restaurants they are passed over. Not today. Kenzie treated my kids with the same respect and attention she treated me with. All 3 kids made comments about how kind and great she was.  I was overwhelmed by her service today and just wanted give her a big THANK YOU!!!!! So Kenzie from us to you..... we think you are pretty great!!!!"}
{"text":"First watch is my favorite breakfast spot. They serve this dish called the Bacado... it will make your day!!! The best part tho is Ellen. We go hiking Sunday mornings and then stop off for what is probably the best coffee in town and a Bacado. Ellen makes my day. She's on top of our orders, she's fast, efficient, so sweet, and she's always smiling. I just wanted to give her a shout out for being awesome and making our day a bit brighter!!!!!! Team Ellen all the way"}
{"text":"This was my first time at First Watch and can easily say I would go back.  A friend brought me here while I was in town for the weekend and I only wish there was one closer to me.  Even for being very busy, the two of us were seated very quickly.  The servers were friendly and informative and the atmosphere was all around good.  I ordered two of the specials, neither of which I can remember the names.  The juice I ordered was an orange, carrot, and ginger blend and was so refreshing I was tempted to order another to go.  The meal I ordered was the crab cake Benedict which was a hearty amount of crab on thick toast with eggs Benedict on top served with a fresh arugula salad topped with lemon juice.    My friend ordered the yogurt parfait and muffin which she said she loved.  Over all, the restaurant was cute and fresh, the food delicious, and the service good.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food at First Watch is good quality, but the taste is very bland and the food overpriced. I got the Denver Melt, the special of the day so I wouldn't end up spending $10 on breakfast.  It was $8 after tax and tip instead.  Still kinda expensive.  The english muffins were cold by the time I got them and the melt was extremely bland.  Not enough cheese and none of the extra ingredients really added any flavor.  While I personally would give it two stars, it does have its purpose. It is one of the only places I know where you can get a healthy breakfast right off the menu and if you're on the go that can be important.  For me however, I'll just stay home and make my own \"denver melt\" with warm english muffins."}
{"text":"For lunch - A non-descript soup / salad / sandwich place in a mall.   A cup of soup and a salad on a platter - I was hungry, and it was needed fuel.  It was a sit-down restaurant with the feel of cafeteria meets Little House on the Prairie meets retired matron.  It served its purpose, but I won't be going back for lunch.  Breakfast on the other hand is a different story - well done and of good quality.  This is a homey breakfast place, with a good variety and good quality.  It is surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We tried this FW location for lunch today and were very pleased. We had the lemon ricotta pancakes and the blueberry pancakes. Both were hot and very yummy. Can't wait to go back. So many things on their menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"This place was really great they accommodated our party of eight people at the last minute and the service was wonderful. Would definitely recommend if you were passing through."}
{"text":"We loved The Good Egg when it was here.  Every Saturday for 8 yrs!  Now, its a new place. The decor is very rustic, modern reclaimed. I would classify this menu as \"Artsy Fartsy\". LOL The menu was verrt similar to Good Egg,  still served the Avocado toast plate, one of my favorites! Not too impressed overall. It was just okay. A little pricey for ordinary food. The wait staff was friendly but not too attentive."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and I really enjoyed it. The juice from the juice bar was great my food was awesome and the service was very pleasant. I will return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"100% wonderful.  We had a wonderful time. The server was nice.  BUTTERNUT SQUASH & WILD MUSHROOM FRITTATAA classic frittata with house-roasted butternut squash, Crimini and Shiitake mushrooms, green onions and topped with Monterey Jack, Parmesan and fresh herbs. Served with lemon dressed mixed greens and a toasted ciabatta crisp. 9.49  We had an exchange, and they handled it smooth."}
{"text":"I've been here a good handful of times and have yet to order something I dont like. The staff is always friendly, the food is super fresh and satisfying-- and local! Plus the fresh-squeezed juices are always so crisp and light, they really lighten your mood! I also love the homey atmosphere of the restaurant; the whole place is dimly-lit and feels almost like a cabin with all the wood work.  This time I got BLT eggs benedict & pumpkin pancakes. The eggs benedict never fails, with the perfectly poached eggs, fresh slices of vine-ripened tomato and avocado, creamy hollandaise, and lemon-dressed spinach. My favorite part is the toasted sour ciabatta, and how the bacon is crispy with flecks of undrendered fat. My only complaint is how hard it is to eat, but what eggs benedict isn't? 10/10 The pumpkin pancakes, on the other hand, were kind of a let down. They were stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth good, with syrup. Fluffy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. But they definitely woulda benefitted from some more pumpkin in the batter, and topped with some candied pecans. But that's just me. 6/10"}
{"text":"My group of 8 came to First Watch for brunch on a Saturday morning around 11:30 am. There was no line when we arrived. We had to wait only briefly for them to clear some tables and move them together. A large crowd came while we were waiting.   We were seated and experienced VERY attentive service. Our server was great, very funny and friendly. We were quickly brought water and coffee, which were both left on the table for convenient refills. I was dining with some slightly difficult eaters, but he was very accommodating. The first half of our party got their food SUPER quickly but it was about 5-10 minutes before the other half got theirs- that was my only qualm.   Food-wise everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. I had the Farm Stand Breakfast Tacos. It came with three tacos full of scrambled eggs, chicken, chorizo, and cheese topped with a slice of avocado each and their house-made pico de gallo. The meal came with black beans but I subbed it for a cup of berries (you can specify if you want berries as opposed to just a regular fruit cup, not sure if it was an extra charge). I was really happy with my meal! Perfect amount of food. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of flavor in the meal. The chorizo and pico de gallo really exceeded my expectations.   Definitely one of the best experiences I've had at a chain restaurant. Service was wonderful. Food came out very quickly. Everything was very good and very well-priced. This was the perfect place for our family brunch!"}
{"text":"Great weekend breakfast place. Love the variety of the menu and option to sit outside. The pricing is fair and the coupons you can sign up for don't expire which is great. My family from out of town also likes this place when they visit. The bacon is always crispy. Love their whole grain toast. If you really do like that coffee you can buy it by the bag. My only complaint is there coffee is a little too strong for me. But overall would recommend and be back again."}
{"text":"Refused to even place a party of 7 adults and 3 children on the wait list. Extremely poor customer service, supervisor was not willing to make any accommodations."}
{"text":"What a great find while on vacation and needing a breakfast place we could take our dog to. Service (Erin) was fantastic...friendly, fast and she was so great with our kids. Great kids menu and great prices. My husband had one of the skillets and I had the bacon, avocado omelette. Both were great. Love the inside even th I ugh we sat on the patio. Great feel. Wish we had this close to home."}
{"text":"The Food and Juice were amazing super delicious, it's too bad the staff was quite short and a bit rude to my wife and I. We were sat completely out of order and had to wait for other patrons who arrived after us to finish eating before we were sat. Besides the fact our server who him self had tattoos was very off put by and made quite a spectacle amongst the rest of the staff and paraded them to our table to them make rude comments not even out of ear shot. We waited almost an hour after being seated for our food (an egg sandwich) when our food did arrive we were not very politely rushed by our server to pay so they could flip the table and seat someone I guess they would prefer to interact with or who had less body art. The real cherry on top of the situation when the server decided we were ready to leave he dropped the check and began clearing dishes I politely asked if we were able to purchase a juice to go we were answered with a sigh and a snatch of the check \"well I guess I have to adjust for you now\" and with a turn the server crop dusted our table. Yes exactly what you are thinking he passed wind directly in our direction not 12inches from our faces and snickered as he walked away. It's just a shame that we were treated as poorly as we were because of our appearance."}
{"text":"Held our monthly Club breakfast here earlier this month and arrived with a group of twenty one members. Very accommodating, excellent wait staff and all of the food was served at the same time in less than twenty minutes, most impressive! Nice sized portions, presented well and very tasty. Atmosphere is welcoming and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're expecting to visit this location and find the same great dishes, you'll be sad to see what you find.   It appears that First Watch had a bit of a makeover in the worst way. However, I'll start with the redeeming factor: juices and healthy foods are still the star on their menu. It's their execution where you'll find them lacking.   My sister, boyfriend, and I stopped here for a very late breakfast on a Friday afternoon. We were sat within a few minutes. We came here for the eggs benedict and were pretty bummed to see that they changed their \"classic\" benedict to come with ciabatta, instead of on the traditional, English muffin. Can we start by maybe someone explaining how ciabatta is \"classic\" on eggs benedict? I'm OK with the tomato, but while we're on the topic, that's not really classic, either. However, we were reassured that we could place our order with English muffins, so we ordered and waited. Our dishes came out with a mound of undressed mixed greens instead of potatoes. Weird. Nothing like delicate, bland greens being wilted by warm hollandaise sauce. I was pretty grossed out. Speaking of warm, the hollandaise was the only warm part. And it came poured over an egg so over-cooked, it looked like a hard-boiled egg. Featured underneath the hard-yolk egg was metallic-tasting, cold, ham slices atop a room temperature English muffin half. I took one bite and had to send it back.   Speaking of sending my dish back, that's actually not 100% correct. To send your dish back that would mean a server would have to stop to ask how your food was before they delivered the check. That never happened. My sister's food was fine, but my boyfriend and I just took one bite and sat there waiting... hungry. The server came back only to drop the check. She noticed two full plates of food and asked how it was. My boyfriend explained in more words that they were inedible and she said, \"I'm sorry\" and tried to give us the check anyways. My boyfriend had to tell her that we were not paying and that we didn't have time for them to try it again since she waited so long to check on us. It took him to tell her we weren't going to pay for food we didn't eat when she should be offering that in the first place.   I don't live around here anymore, but I visit a few times a year. I won't be back here to spend my money."}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought of bacon and cheddar pancakes! Had to try them and I was not disappointed. Salty and sweet - dessert and breakfast all in one.  The service was a little lacking so that reduced my review. Hubby prefers Matt's BB but wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to First Watch and it was good. I will say don't order the poached eggs as they obviously don't have a egg poaching device or know how to make them. My poached eggs came out in a ramekin and basically looked like half heated raw eggs. So, get eggs any other way but I was too hungry to complain or bother. I just ate them...the waffle was excellent, the bacon was good not great. Not sure where First Watch originated but it's obviously from the North....was disappointed no Chicken and Waffles on the menu...."}
{"text":"The chain bought Egg and I recently had an opportunity to visit their south Mesa location.  It was on a Sunday, arrival at 11:30 am.  The young man at the door with the I-pad told us it would be a 45 minute wait.  Okay.  A peek inside revealed about 8 empty tables.  But I know this is the latest trendy restaurant and we were meeting friends there, so we waited.  An hour later we were seated.  Right from the start service was bad.  Our waitress seemed frazzled and overworked.  Took a long time to get a pot of coffee, water, and a glass of milk, and then she spilled quite a bit of milk on the table.  I mopped it up with my napkin and when I later explained why I needed another napkin, she asked \"Was it that bad?\" After nearly a thirty minute wait our food finally arrived (by this time it was 1 pm and half the tables were empty).  I had the standard two-egg, meat and potatoes breakfast for $10.00.  My wife had a similar dish.  There was nothing out of the ordinary about my food.  Just two eggs, pork sausage, hash browns, and whole grain bread, the only choice.  The eggs were as good as you can get anywhere; what can you say about the sausage, except I could get just as good a product in the frozen food department of the local Fry's Market; the potatoes were okay, but nothing special, and the toasted whole grain was cold and had a dry texture.  My wife enjoyed her meal. Our companions excused our server's slowness by saying, \"Well, it is a Sunday morning.\"  Really!  You'd think a restaurant chain that only did breakfast and brunch would know that Sunday's are the busiest morning of their week and be prepared to handle the crowd.  Not here.  At times it appeared the staff was overwhelmed. Total bill, with a $3.00 tip, was nearly $35.00, including coffee, OJ, and a glass of milk.  That seems like a lot for what we got.  I can do better at Denny's and they know how to perform when it gets busy."}
{"text":"the interior is crisp and clean and well laid out. plenty of tables without feeling smushed into each other.   service was quick and attentive. the coffee was very good...strong. they leave the carafe on the table so you don't have to constantly ask for refills.   i had the crimini mushroom omelette. 3 fluffy eggs loaded with mushrooms, cheddar, and tomatoes. came with a choice side of greens or potatoes, and an english muffin. it was cooked very well and i love that someone is serving salad greens at breakfast. it's a great thing!  reasonably priced, about 8-9 bucks per meal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you have a couple hours to waste. Food just mediocre and limited in taste with a lot of filler onions, peppers etc. not the main ingredient like salmon, chorizo, sausage. Never was checked on after served, guess they are use to the negative replays or comments."}
{"text":"Took out a healthy egg white omelette with turkey, and a club sandwich. The egg white omelette was a joke. The turkey consisted of minuscule pieces. It could have been ham for all I know. The club sandwich was equally disappointing. Not my idea of what a club sandwich should look like or consist of. Bad experience for sure."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of First Watch and am very happy to have them open up a restaurant so close to home. I have dined here several times and have no complaints other than I wish they were open later. There's days when it's dinner time and I am craving First Watch but they sadly close at 2:30.   There isn't a bad thing on the menu. I have had the crepes with a muffin, the breakfast sandwich with potatoes and a turkey burger. All were extremely delicious! It is really the perfect brunch spot with so many different options to pick from. Everyone loves options! One thing I truly love about this spot is the food always tastes fresh. If you are in the mood for something healthy they have something you will enjoy or if you are looking to satisfy your waffle / pancake cravings they have those too! I met up with a friend and her daughter around 10 o'clock Saturday and there was a 45 minute wait. So the earlier you go I think the better it will be if you do not have time to wait. We didn't mind because we had a lot of catching up too do! This will always be my spot to grab brunch in the north hills area :)"}
{"text":"Love going here wish i could go everyday.  They have awesome healthy options that taste amazing. It is one of the few places you can go if you are counting your macro nutrients or even just calorie intake without breaking your calorie/macro bank.  Only down side is like every other breakfast/brunch place they close at like 2pm. But to be fair i am sure that helps with the quality.   I love the pesto chicken bowl and if i can spare the calories the chickiechanga is really good too. There seasonal options are always good too."}
{"text":"Delicious egg sandwich. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had. Coffee was good and they keep a pot at the table."}
{"text":"We typically go here for breakfast so I usually order breakfast items. I've always wanted to try the sandwiches and salads but end up ordering breakfast because it's good anytime of the day!  For this visit, I had to order my standard kale tonic since it's my favorite!!  At another location, my server let me sample another drink on the menu but after having the kale tonic, nothing compares to it in my opinion.  I also ordered off the seasonal menu this time and tried the SoCal Breakfast Burrito which was fabulous and healthy!  I've enjoyed everything I have ordered in the past which includes lemon ricotta pancakes, the Tri-Fecta and Chickichanga.  I really like this location too since there's plenty of space and I haven't had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"First watch was located right next door to the hotel I was staying in. Pricing in reasonable and the food is amazing. The French toast and hash potatoes are the best"}
{"text":"Nice, clean atmo.  Decent service.  Mixed feelings about the food itself.  This is supposed to be \"healthy\" sort of food, but for a breakfast joint I'd hope for better options for the coffee.  The familiar pink packets are on the table (can anyone say \"C\" word?) and there are mass produced artificially flavored creamer pop-tubs of creamer, like \"French Vanilla\", but nothing really \"natural\" is provided like stevia (or even \"Truvia\") or just plain old real cream that hasn't been cooked and packaged.  How about give the option to pay a little more for healthy sweetener or even real cream or soy/rice milk?  My benedict florentine was like a salad with a runny egg on it and some unusual, thin lemony salad dressing.  How about put \"Benedict\" in quotes (like I just did) if you're going to smother the thing in lemony salad dressing instead of real Hollandaise and not tell me?  I don't eat meat but my guess is that the usual nitrites are still there in the ham and bacon despite the knowledge that the \"C\" word is also associated with these.  Again, how about giving an option to pay a few dollars more so my family members, who want to opt-in on the meat, can not be fooled by brown bread thinking they are in a \"C\" free zone here with the food and drink.  Ahhh... just my two cents for those looking for authentic \"health\" food and not just some extra green and brown on their plates.  Time to take it further First Watch and really cater to the health food enthusiasts and up your game."}
{"text":"A lot of food from breakfast places tend to taste of fatigue and depressed cooks, but not here. Food tastes fresh, nice portions, and great variety on omelettes and sandwiches. Waffles and pancakes taste fresh and fluffy, and helps with the depression of being in Downtown Phoenix. The staff is always great--feels like a folksy 1950's movie because they're mostly moms who ply on the coffee and food and tell you to eat your veggies."}
{"text":"Food was great - hot when it arrived and quick coming out. Service, on the other hand, I've never encountered such a grumpy, rude waitress. She walked over and just looked at us - didn't say hello or good morning - just \"do you want water?\"   Overall, our visit was not impacted. I usually love First Watch and would absolutely recommend for a quick breakfast or lunch. Coffee is good, everything is tasty ... just hoping a manager sees this and takes the review regarding staff to heart."}
{"text":"Who serves pressed juice with ice?!?!?!?!, first watch in Pittsburgh does and they don't understand why it would be served any other way"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this new place, new to me, and I am not sorry. The brisket has is amazing. I wasn't sure when it came out with a drizzle of bbq sauce but it truly a meal worth getting. Waitress, Lori was a sweetheart. Sat at the community table so there wasn't a wait!!! I will be back for sure. Maybe lunch next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite, go-to breakfast spots. There is never a long wait for breakfast on the weekends, and service is exceptionally friendly. The menu is absolutely fantastic. They know how to take healthy food and make it hearty and satisfying. I've never been let down by an order and I usually choose something from the lighter side options. I also appreciate that all options have the amount of calories listed. My very favorite thing here are the juices. They're fresh, sweet, and simple. I can only hope that this gem of a breakfast joint doesn't get too popular!"}
{"text":"Not the freshest ingredients this time around. Service was okay.  Could of been better, I have ate at other first watch and the foods was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This was probably the best restaurant I have ever eaten breakfast at. The bread was fresh, the selections on the menu were amazing. They have everything from omelettes to pancakes and fresh pressed juices. It is very vegetarian friendly as well. I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict.....it was delicious. I highly recommend First Watch. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Short wait time! Great breakfast! Had the Eggs Benedict w/ smoked salmon. My bf had the Power Bowl. Everything was delicious! My 1yr old devoured the cheese grits."}
{"text":"For a place that emphasizes quinoa, kale and freshly juiced veggie drinks, it is shocking how few choices there are for vegans.  I saw two options -- one was some sort of wrap (although I would have needed to ask the waitress to hold the cheese) and the other was the veggie burger.  I ended up choosing the veggie burger, but I would have preferred a nice, oil-free tofu scramble.  I've started making oil-free tofu scramble at home -- it is quite simple to prepare.  Why not offer tofu as protein to sub in for most of the egg dishes?  It'd be so simple, and I guarantee you'll end up selling alot more than you think.  The vegan population is exploding!!  Let me know when you start offering a tofu scramble, and I'll immediately upgrade my review."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this First Watch is woodsy, rustic and cozy.  I ordered the veggie and goat cheese omelette, with toast and potatoes on the side. It was delicious! Also, I had it made with egg whites instead of whole eggs, and it was at no additional cost. The toast was soft on the inside and had lots of seeds, which I love.   I also got the melon juice, which is made with honeydew melon, English cucumber, agave and lemon, and it was the BEST juice I have ever had. Simple, sweet, and incredibly refreshing, especially in this summer heat. It was $3.99, which, for the size, was a good price compared to the prices of other juices at juice bars or even at the store.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have told my wife how great First Watch was.  Boy did I look like a fool.  We waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  The waitress was friendly and promptly took our order.  When our food arrived I was ready to take a bite of the omelette I ordered when I noticed that there was hair in my food.  I sent it back and the waitress started telling me stories about how her food was dropped on the floor at another restaurant and did blame me for sending it back.  I did not order anything else.  I was very surprised when NOT one person from management came to my table to apologize. I went to pay for my wife's meal and the man at the cash register never ask how out experience was.  He was kinda rude.  I will never return to a First Watch."}
{"text":"Great Food! Cozy Ambiance! Amazingly friendly staff! Sometimes a short wait on the weekend but so worth it! The coffee is delicious, and the carrot cake pancakes are great for sharing, along with one of the many great savory meals. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times went this morning and got pancakes on the first bite I found a fly trapped between my pancakes it was still alive moving ! Time for a inspection from the city I wonder what the kitchen looks like ."}
{"text":"This place is always great tasting but the staff are super accommodating and you can tell they always want the experience to be great.  The JUICE Bar drinks are super delicious too"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were looking for a place to eat and Lisa thought about First Watch. It's Just around the corner from her client's house. So Lisa wanted a salad and i was looking for something more heavier. we looked at the menu and was intrigued on how the Horseradish Valvarti cheese was going to taste with Roast beef. She had the salad with Lemon-Maple Vinagerette. HMMM!!! that tool a leap for both of us. Got to say SLAM DUNK!!!! I also go the Half salad Sweet Honey Pecan with Tomato and Basil Soup. She had the Superfood Kale Salad.  Perfect.  If you love foods the great homeade taste, try it with the slightly sweet and good Flavor from FIRST WATCH It was Awesome!! Will Return Here!!"}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast or brunch. I would give them five stars but they're only open until 2:30 pm. I like brunch in the evening also, Especially when the food is so good."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place since moving to Phoenix! They are always very accommodating and if you don't like something they are more than happy to replace it with something you enjoy! Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Everything is fresh. Enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich. Dined with my family. They enjoyed the French toast. Will return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service! Easy parking and accessible parking for and larger vehicles! Great for adults and children alike!"}
{"text":"Five stars!  Best of the Best! Amazing and special breakfast foods, fantastic service (thanks Elizabeth) and even a selection of newspapers and help yourself coffee if you are waiting (we were greeted warmly and seated immediately). We loved the banana granola crunch pancake, maybe the best ever.  I'm going for two next time!  First Watch is a relatively new brunch chain which my wife REALLY enjoyed over in Philly last month. We also checked out their location on 50 West in Bridgeville and it was terrific as well.  This is our new favorite brunch spot in all of Pittsburgh (sorry Square Cafe, First Watch has left you in the dust for us)."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here twice in the last month and extremely satisfied both times. The food is absolutely delicious and the service was wonderful both times. Our waiter, Michael, was especially great. He was super knowledgeable of the menu, and just the right amount of friendly. Thanks, Michael, for making our dining experience so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food was good standard food. The wait staff was not appropriately zoned for the restaurant. There was one employee in particular that seemed to boss the others but was not a manager the best I could tell. She openly dismissed the staff and could be hear yelling to the cook for when food was ready. The food wait time was about 45 minutes for a nearly empty restaurant. I would come back for the food itself but maybe to another chain location."}
{"text":"Great service. Good menu with some interesting twists. Excellent place to come for breakfast or brunch. Our waitress Paula was very nice and helped us find some great places to go during our vacation."}
{"text":"I gave it another shot for breakfast. I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5, because when I asked if there was gluten free bread the answer was no. The server said so many people asks for it. So, the food taste and quality is excellent. The variety is decent. The service is excellent. The coffee is good. I ask for gluten free bread. It is breakfast afterall."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far but the food was delicious (I got one of their quinoa power packed bowls, and I never eat quinoa) and the service was outstanding. Definitely recommend coming out and trying this place out!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times, and always love the food and have had good service. This last visit was truly exceptional though, and I have to shout about it. My husband and I walked in and told them we had a party of four, and were seated right away. After 15 minutes, my father shows up (he is always running late :/), and informs me he has invited his entire extended family to brunch with us, without preciously mentioning this. And now we have a party of SEVENTEEN PEOPLE!! I explain to our waitress Kim, who has already been so patient waiting for us to wait for my father, what has happened, and she calmly tries to accommodate all of us. She managed to get us three tables all fairly close together (and combined two of them just for us) to seat my entire family. That is going above and beyond in my opinion, and she continued the excellent service from there on out, regardless of what my crazy family threw at her :P Good job Kim, and as I mentioned previously, always excellent food here!!"}
{"text":"We got to try First Watch tonight as part of a special event, #FirstBiteatFirstWatch, with the No Kid Left Hungry campaign. They let us try items off their new fall menu, and we got to give donations in lieu of the check. It was so cool and a very fun experience! :)   The fall menu was really yummy. It started with a Carrot Ginger Chai that I really liked. I didn't think I would because I'm not huge on ginger or carrot juices, but it was really sweet and had cinnamon flavors, too. I thought it was a very unique and interesting start for the breakfast items.   Next we got to share an order of the Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich, Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal and Pumpkin Pancake Breakfast. The Pumpkin Pancake was definitely my favorite - I'll be coming back for that in the fall for sure! It came with warm maple syrup, chicken sausage and eggs. The pancake had a really tasty flavor that had just the right amount of pumpkin.   The Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal wasn't for me, but I don't care for oatmeal in general lol. It's cool how they put cranberries and pepitas on top! It came with an orange-cranberry muffin that was good, though.   The Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich was really tasty as well! I liked the arugula on it, and I really loved that they used mayo. On the side were breakfast potatoes and those were amazing :)   I'm really happy I got to try the sneak-peak of this menu as part of such a unique event and good cause, but I think I will for sure come back again to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service and amazing food. Loved the atmosphere. Must try the blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"A good option for a quick and healthy breakfast. At least it felt healthy - I ordered pancakes with fresh fruit, sprinkled with powdered sugar and wheatgerm and they were very good. Coffee is a bit expensive, as is the rest of the menu, but it's very fresh and delicious. Staff is friendly and attentive, and the food was served very quickly. They serve breakfast all day, as well as some wraps and sandwiches. Also opening a new restaurant in Solon sometime this winter. Yay!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fresh ingredients make this a great place for breakfast or lunch.  Coffee is brought out by the pot, per table so no wait for refills but it's a bit pricier this way. Menu concentrates on breakfast items like omelets, frittatas, pancakes, french toast. More on the healthy side. I got french toast sprinkled with powdered sugar, wheat germ, bananas and kiwi fruit. All the fruit was delicious and fresh. My friend got an omelet with salsa, potatoes, peppers, and sausage and loved it.  The menu also has sandwiches and salads if you are more in a mood for lunch, and the options are bit more expensive than Bob Evans but stand out as better quality.  Service is relatively fast, once you get a table (there was a bit of  a wait on the weekend). If you are looking for more of a healthy upscale breakfast than a greasy spoon, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Finally a multi location multi state breakfast house gets it very very right."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for breakfast on Sunday's for several years.  Always had a good experience.  Well they've remodeled, it appears so they can cram as many of us in as possible.  It is now noisy and busy and the waitresses could care less whether you eat or not.  Prices have gone up and they no longer reduce the price on a breakfast if you don't order the meat.  Meat or not you are paying for the meat.  Sad.  My family will not be back."}
{"text":"If suburban Pittsburgh can add more places like First Watch to their neighborhoods, I might not only come back at Christmas to visit my parents.  While a chain, the food was great.  First Watch is what I think of when people say, \"Let's get brunch.\"  While I love dive-y diners for certain breakfast foods, I love the brunch that is super fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Omelet ($10.29), which came with whole grain bread, the house strawberry preserves, and organic mixed greens.  It was delicious.  As one of the only people in the world who does not eat potatoes, I was so thrilled for the mixed greens.  They were lightly dressed and delicious.  The artisan bread is notable and fresh, and the strawberry preserves were quite delectable.  The omelet had a lot of ham and cheese, and the quality of everything was good.  The meal was filling, and I really enjoyed it.  Our server was terrible, but that seems to be an issue that others had as well.  She asked what we wanted to drink, dropped off our food, and dropped a check at the same time.  She never checked on our food.  Luckily, everything was good so it all worked out for us."}
{"text":"Back in October, went to First Watch (so sad about Good Egg).  Had high expectations because chain originated in my hometown and always wonderful.  It was horrible.  Bad server, cold food.  I posted my Yelp and manager contacted me and offered me a gift certificate to try again.  I accepted, but I doubted I would use it.  Thursday I did, at lunch with a friend.  Food was good and hot. I had the chile and chorizo omelette, and it was very tasty.  My friend had the beef and havarti sandwich and tomato-basil soup, and she said it was delicious.  So I would say it was a good visit, except that the experience was made superior by a wonderful young server named Austin. If we could have that lovely young man be our server on every visit, I'd go there all the time!  (Assuming quality of food remains decent).  He was warm and attentive and ever-so-patient with the those loopy ladies in the corner booth!  His attitude is what gave this review a 4th star!"}
{"text":"I sometimes reward myself for getting out of bed early on Saturdays or Sundays with a breakfast trip to First Watch--which is to say that I really don't go to First Watch all that often.  I've never waited there when there are crowds (and it does get crowded during weekend brunch times).  While the waiting area looks comfortable enough with free coffee and big couches, Brio and Cheesecake Factory are alternatives with substantially more dining space.  The dining room, while your basic diner, exudes a sunny and pleasant atmosphere.  There is free wi-fi, but you have to access it through a splash screen and login.  I think the main advantage First Watch has over the other Crocker Park brunch locales are the healthier options available.  I enjoy the Tri-Athelete Omelet, and there is also the Oatmeal if you're looking for something even lighter.  I haven't had much of the lunch/sandwich fare--if only First Watch were open for dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch restaurant, with some traditional lunch fare for the more...er, traditional.   Staying at the Biltmore close by, which shuts down brunch fare at 930am!  So glad this place is literally a 5 minute drive, and serves brunch through 230pm! Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon when your flight lands 3am in the morning and you stumble out of bed at 1230pm.   The egg hash was fantastic! Coffee is decent, nothing to write home about, but isn't over burnt like star*gag*bucks."}
{"text":"This place was great, excellent food, environment, and service. Small parking lot which makes it hard to find parking and a lot of people but the wait wasn't to bad. Even if there was a long wait it would have been well worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite location! Great service and attentive staff. Friendly and caring people! I had a problem with my breakfast and the problem was fixed right away I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"My girl waited at the host stand for 10 minutes never got acknowledged sat or spoken too! And yes it was 10 minutes because I was late and we were on the phone when she walked in the door. I would have been a first time customer but if that's how the start is going to be I could only imagine it wouldn't have gotten better from there! Also watched n older gentleman bussing tables and a server bussing tables instead of atleast saying hi I'll grab a host or something!"}
{"text":"We hav been comings here since they opens! We LOVE IT! HOWEVER, I'm not sure what has happened with the service but our last 3 visit have been the worst!! 45 min wait to get out food all 3 times.  Staff is RUDE and not accommodating at all!! We are sooo disappointed! Again, food was good if u we've get it and can stomach the staff!"}
{"text":"First time my family and I trying out this place. No long wait, place clean and felt cozy. Our breakfast was delicious and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to tell you the service and food we're beyond my expectations.  Our server Kim was amazing!  Great suggestions and took the time to explain the menu which made all the difference in the world.  This is a new concept for them, rustic fresh and natural farm to table from local suppliers.  Their pumpkin pancakes  Cherry wood  bacon and chicken apple sausage are definite must in my book"}
{"text":"Love their Breakfasts, can't pass up the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes: however there are so many delicious items to choose from. My husbands favorite is the Parma Hash, and you must try the Chia seed pudding. With great service, you can sample the fresh juices prepared daily, and my favorite is Morning Meditation."}
{"text":"Fabulous Inviting Really convenient  Sweet Pancakes and Smoothies Tasty Omelets Wickedly delicious food Avocados Tempting  Convenient location right off 79 Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. All their food is amazing always and they have such a wide diverse menu. One of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  This used to be The Good Egg, but new ownership made this space look so much more modern & beautiful, and the food is better than ever!  Great breakfast place !!"}
{"text":"Since there aren't exactly a ton of good brunch options in the suburbs outside of my own kitchen, this place is great. The food is a bit on the pricey side for the location, but there are tons of delicious options. Great for vegetarians too! Come early if you don't want to wait a long time; this place gets crowded on weekends. I only wish they were opener a little later and had mimosas. I'm tryna have a boozy brunch, ya know what I'm sayin?"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here twice now & enjoyed the food both times! Both times I went it was on a weekday & wasn't crowded. Love that they have healthy options and healthy juices! Also, egg whites are at no extra charge. The atmosphere is nice and they've done a great job with the place! Some things could be improved but they're a new restaurant and have to work the kinks out still! Definitely a new go-to restaurant for us! :)"}
{"text":"This is such a cute breakfast spot!! I'll definitely go again. The staff are very friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. My breakfast was pretty tasty, I really enjoyed it. I got the AB&J waffle with a side of eggs and bacon. I got the maple almond butter, strawberry preserves, and granola on the side because I wanted to make I sure I would like the taste of everything together first. It was a really good combo. I didn't use much of the granola though. Bacon was really good and the eggs were eggs. Im not even a big huge coffee person but the coffee was GREAT!! The only downside is it's a bit pricey for breakfast, in my opinion. The breakfast was good but I've had better for less."}
{"text":"One of my favorite experiences with a restaurant ever!! Staff was friendly and laid back. Food was AMAZING!!! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is because they forgot to put on my order and did not own up to it for one hour. Then the manager was unwilling to stop what he was doing to give me a refund."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much to blame for getting everyone I know hooked on this place! It's so cute and hidden by the freeway! Lots of healthy and delicious choices for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before, and the food is good, but the service is horrible. I have eaten at First Watch down on Thomas and 3rd Ave for years and always enjoyed their food and the service was always prompt. Yesterday, however, we sat on the patio of this half-empty First Watch on Val Vista in Mesa and waited for 10 minutes before being recognized by a server just to place our order. The coffee and water arrived promptly, but 25 minutes later I told the server that I was leaving in 5 minutes if no food arrived. 6 minutes later, as we were leaving, the server walked out with our order and asked if we'd like it \"to go?\" Are you kidding? Then they had the audacity to charge me $6 for the two coffees."}
{"text":"I love first watch, my usual is Thomas & 1st Ave!  Running errands,  find this location and I'm Hangry! Why a 20 min wait when you have lots of open unseated tables?!   Maybe I'll love it after I eat!  After eating review:  Pros:  Hostess (mel?) Exactly what you want,  very welcoming,  all the staff very nice & friendly.   I ordered the traditional. My eggs not correct,  bacon cold, didn't bring toast and than when they did, pre-made up...cold, butter not melted.   My husband and I also shared a pancake  , that came out first no syrup,  I finally got up to ask Hostess.   Our waiter was new, never a problem we all have to start somewhere,  but the whole team must be new! We had several attempts of others people's food been delivered,  ours to there table.   Our waiter took our order promptly,  and than never really came back.  Never brought water or creamer for coffee,  looking around other tables really didn't have service either.   The food took forever.   I gave my feedback to the Hostess,  super professional & sweet, offered a comp on the bacon, we are not those people, we still ate all the food, I was starving! Lol  I don't live in the area and will probably not be back,  but hopefully in a couple months they stabilize!   I still love First watch and will continue to eat there. I think the food service was purely since they are new location."}
{"text":"Long time customer,  food consistently good.  Just recently I added 1 lemon ricotta pancake to my meal.....  soooo good, definitely split worthy to try!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the Good Egg but now it's First Watch. I really like the woodsy interior , the restaurant was clean and overall had a great atmosphere! Parking was nice since we got to park right in front & it wasn't as busy for a Saturday. I ordered the BLT Eggs Benedict which came out on a long ciabatta bread. Usually Egg Benedict comes out on two English muffins or bagels so it was the first time I've seen it served on a ciabatta bread. The bread was light and crispy, not to hard. The hollandaise was light and not as salty. The only thing I didn't care for was that it came with a side salad. The salad just did not go with my breakfast and I would have rather got a side of fresh fruit instead. You can tell by the menu that this place is geared towards healthier food options . My fiancé got the BBQ brisket hash and that was delicious! It had good flavor and the potatoes, eggs and brisket with the BBQ sauce on top all worked really well together. Overall food was great, price was not to expensive, our server was attentive. The only thing I would suggest is maybe not bringing out our bill right after we get our food. I felt kinda rushed to eat my food ."}
{"text":"Although I was a fan of the Good Egg that was here before, I am pleased with first watch. I always appreciate a place with healthy options that are actually good. I also like that they have the nutrition facts on the menu, this helps a lot when trying to choose something that will be enough to fill me up but not too much. I also like how it looks now better than how it looked as the good egg. This time I got something off the seasonal menu, AB & J waffle, a waffle with almond butter, fresh strawberries, some kind of strawberry compote or something, and granola on top. It was delicious! Not too filling, just the right amount. My sister and I also shared a Kale aid juice. It was really sweet, I think it was mostly fruit. It wasn't bad though. I tried my moms potatoes and I'm kind of glad I didn't order something with potatoes because they didn't taste very good. Service was great though!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get seated!  I love the First Watch restaurants and I know they're always very busy.  No matter how busy, I've always been greeted - not at this restaurant.  There were 3 parties in line to pay and zero staff at the front of the house.  I waited for the parties to pay - there was no one else seating - when someone else came behind me to pay & the cashier told them to get in front and she'd take them next - ok but when yet another guest came up to pay and she took them too, I walked out.   Wonder how many others walk too."}
{"text":"food was good, unfortunately when i went to use the restroom, i had to wait for one of the servers to finish vaping inside so that i could use it. then, when i returned to our table, our server asked if i was ready to order when i hadn't had the chance to look at the menu due to waiting for vape man. during our meal, both the vape man and our server sat by us to eat their meals which is pretty unorthodox as far as restaurants go. then, we were given our check before we had the chance to ask for coffee that we were going to drink before we left. we came in an hour before close, so we should not have been rushed like this. only person who was nice was the older lady who asked if we needed water, while our server never did. probably won't return."}
{"text":"The Monterey Club was so delicious! I finished it before I had a chance to take a picture. The 5 star is for the food. Service was good, nothing bad nor extraordinary. We received our food in a very timely manner as well."}
{"text":"My first watch debut was with my fam on a weekday, around brunch. Very clean place and smart layout. The service from start to finish was attentive and on point. The menu has you leaning in all directions- breakfast, lunch, or brunch. I went with the million $ bacon and a chocolate chip pancake. The warm syrup is a nice touch on both the pancake and bacon. The adults enjoyed a few coffees and our toddler crushed a generous kids breakfast plate (fruit, bacon, egg, toast.) first watch left a great first impression and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of these types of trendy chains but I live nearby and wanted to try something new.  If you come before 8 am on a Saturday there is no line at all.  Our service was okay.  Everything we ordered came out cold, millionaire bacon, potatoes, pankcake, eggs - the only thing hot was the coffee.  This was still before the breakfast rush so I'm not sure why we were served cold food but it was still good.  Not good enough to visit again but worth a try."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good. Staff is always friendly. There's usually a line but I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes.  Pancakes and the chickicanga our both favorites. Be careful not all the locations have to same items. Sometimes online shows something that's not on the menu,"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. I've tried almost everything on the menu. From the omelettes to the lunch menu...the food is delicious and looks picture perfect on the plate. Steve and his crew are fabulous. My husband and I feel like we are dining  with friends when we eat there. This is and will always be a regular spot for us!!!"}
{"text":"Went to first watch with my family to give it a try.  We really liked the pancakes and the avocado toast was dank as well.  Our server Joey made great suggestions and was a really outstanding dude"}
{"text":"Used to be The Good Egg and now is first watch. Used to go every Sunday for brunch as we were Building a stash of dinner cards using the loyalty system. The waitress staff New me as \"Round Toast\" and my friend with the handle bar Mustache. When the change happened they no longer would accept the loyalty cards we had. I surrendered them, I gave them $80.00  worth they gave nothing in return. In return we have not been back for service and have not even driven in the vicinity. Those cards took effort on our part and resulted in consistent business for The Good Egg. Now the First left over."}
{"text":"The food is always good and fresh. And we've never gotten bad service. Get there early though they are normally busy!!"}
{"text":"First Watch had surprisingly good breakfast/brunch food. The surprising part for me was that the food tasted great, and was filling at the same time.  I expected something less sustaining because of the healthy, fresh ingredients.  I had the Chile Chorizo omelet,  with toast and potatoes.  Everything was really delicious. Service was spot-on, and our wait time was not long at 15 minutes, considering we went on a Saturday at noon.  The only negative was the side of \"greens.\"  I expected mustard greens, collard greens, something cooked, with some kind of spice maybe?  The side of greens is basically a small plate with lettuce on it, no spice, nothing, just sitting sad looking little lettuce sitting on a plate, for $2.49. Pass on the greens, and go for bacon or sausage instead if you want a side. Other than the greens, everyone at our table of 8 was happy with their choices. I would definitely eat at First Watch again."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! My boyfriend and I were traveling out of town and found First Watch on Yelp. Good, healthy (really healthy, not \"trying to be healthy but loaded with garbage\") food, fresh squeezed juice, and a nice wait staff. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast last weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee is there own brand and it has a great flavor. I especially like that they have a bunch of different flavored creamers.  The staff is very friendly and efficient. You can tell this is the type of place that has regulars. I also like that they have both breakfast and lunch items to choose from.  I had the Key West Crepe egg. The crepe egg is a mixture between a thin crepe and whipped eggs and it was stuffed with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and probably some other goodies. It came with hash browns and an english muffin. My husband had the traditional breakfast which is pretty much what it sounds like. Overall I would recommend First Watch because it's a great breakfast at a good price with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was fast seating and clean atmosphere. I'm giving it 4 out of five because food was basic nothing to rave about. Order the eggs Benedict and the egg was cooked fully. Other than that that's my only complaint. Would return to probably try something different."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place around! I live across the street and any place even close to here is not nearly as good. The service is great and I love how quick they are to make adjustments for any need you might have. Eggs come out perfect, especially on Thursdays recently for some reason, and I really like the atmosphere of the place. Supes chill yo."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast with my mom when she touched down from out of town. We randomly googled breakfast as we were driving around Scottsdale and this popped up with good reviews...no disappointment and great priced with quality food!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food. I got the half veggie sandwich with superfood kale salad. Vegetarians beware, superfood kale salad comes with chicken on it. They swapped it out quick and all was well. Would love to come back and try the avocado toast!"}
{"text":"My son says the best biscuits and gravy he's ever tasted. I would say the same for the French toast as well as egg, cheese and onion omelet!! Love the decor. Most friendly staff you'll find anywhere! Five stars and more!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and great tasting. The service is attentive and quick. This is by far one of the best breakfast places on this side of town."}
{"text":"I have been here of a few times for breakfast.  I especially enjoy their avocado toast..splendid! Can get busy on the weekends. Awesome juice bar that serves a great drink the Kale tonic with Kale, Fuji apple, cucumber and lemon.  Try the Millionaire's Bacon...it includes 4 thick slices of smoked bacon with brown sugar, black pepper, cayenne with a maple syrup drizzled.  Their drip coffee is strong and fresh.  Prices are good, their service is good and it is an overall clean enviroment."}
{"text":"I came with no expectations. I am blown away!!Amazing Honey Pecan Salad. The dressing was spicy mustard and so, so good. I switched the cheddar cheese for Parmesan just because I love it. It's a large portion-- excellent value. The chicken salad melt looked awesome. My friend loved it. The whole place feels warm and inviting. Brandon was our nice server and really seemed to know the menu well. You should try for lunch! I can't wait to give breakfast a try. Oh and the outside patio is lovely right now!"}
{"text":"Best lemon ricotta pancakes ever.  First time I could actually see and test the ricotta. The lemon curd with the fresh strawberries were the perfect topping.  The bar was set way to high.  I may never order them anywhere else ever again.  Too bad I'll have to wait until parents weekend to have them again.   Can't wait"}
{"text":"Second time here was even better than the first.  Their seasonal menu has barbacoa benedict which is amazing.  The meat was cooked perfectly and went perfect wth the rest of the usual eggs benedict ingredients.  My wife got the French toast and they were great as well.    Service was fast and our server was very friendly.  Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and healthy. Employees are friendly and service is great"}
{"text":"The food is always good but they need to hire a new dish washer. All our dishes were dirty and still had lipstick and old dried up food on them. Got to do better with sanitizing!"}
{"text":"Turkey gravy with biscuits is amazing. Wish they had real cream for coffee but 5 stars anyway!"}
{"text":"We had a very beautiful first time experience here!   Our server was prompt and super friendly.  I loved the menu options! And what we ordered was phenomenal and very fresh tasting. I would definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast taco's are great! Really filling. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good brunch food!! The servers are really friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Music is a bit loud but it's ok sets the tone."}
{"text":"Every time I go to first watch the food is amazing, service is sometimes not the best. This past time I went, I had Zack for a server. He was hands down the best server I have ever had. He was very knowledgeable. Greeted all of his tables fast. Got us all drinks fast. He was very kind and checked in on us frequently. He handled getting triple sat very well and professionally. I will go back and request him as my server."}
{"text":"Nice place with outdoor seating, great on a PHX spring day.  Had Shrimp and Grits special, it was very good and portion was large for the price.  My wife had Honey Pecan salad, it alao was large and with the honey dijon dressing, it was excellent.  Pleasant service that took care of us well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  We go at least once a week. The staff is wonderful and the pancakes are to die for.  The menu has specials for the season and now they have pumpkin pancakes etc. I hope this is enough to convince you to try it. Thunderbird and Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"We had my Birthday, Father's day breakfast there, it was awesome, waiter was friendly, food was great, clean restaurant, we will be back and tell our friends and family about this place. You must try this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes are AMAZING - crispy delicate edges, soft, fluffy and oozing chocolate on the inside. And did I mention huge?  The breakfast sandwich (sorry I don't remember the name) was fantastic, too. The buttery brioche was sturdy enough to keep the gooey yolk, savory pancetta, and other goodies from falling apart in your hand. Breakfast perfection, like an egg mcmuffin that grew up... and got some plastic surgery.   Our waitress was very friendly, though the host guy was kinda weird and spacey. The patio seating was worth the wait. We will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"I love first watch,just not this location...I have been to this one 3 times and the manager is always rude..this time it's packed inside and as we walk in we open the door for him since he is carrying plates and he doesn't even acknowledge us. I would think he wo"}
{"text":"I love first watch! This is my favorite location and that's good since it's also the closest! The veggie grill is so good, it's my go to here. The service is always so good here and they are so friendly! Free wifi as well. I wish the were open for dinner I'm sure it would be so good!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Cuyahoga Falls has another great place for breakfast and brunch. I've been here a handful of times and each experience has been consistent. I really like the overall design. It's open and clean with a nice balance of wood and metal. They have great lighting fixtures and an overall nice farm-to-table environment.  The menu is very nice- clean lines, not too many offerings, and filled with great options. They have seasonal items so be sure to ask if you don't see anything on the menu. Items I've had include eggs bene and the breakfast chimi, which is my go-to menu item. By boyfriend always gets pancakes or French toast. I'm savory, he's sweet. They can take care of us both!   The coffee is really good and the tea selection is ok. They don't have regular creamer, at least not when we've been there, so we've had to ask for milk and that didn't seem like something they normally do. Not sure. You can get a cup to go if you ask.   The restrooms are tricky to find because there aren't any signs, which I found to be odd. You take your check up to the register yourself.   Tip: there can be a long wait. Go early or later in the morning to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been back to this location, and it's probably the last.:  Positive:  clean, very friendly staff and a nice open design.  Negative:  expensive, bland food that tries for the hip and trendy vibe.  What The Good Egg had going for it was done away with.  We went looking for standard breakfast fare and found the menu far from it.    This is what happens when chains who don't research the area and clientele start changing things just to \"be different\".  Sometimes going with what worked before, still works."}
{"text":"We enjoyed patio seating and beautiful weather and a yummy breakfast.  The service was prompt and the food was very delicious.    I tried the seasonal pumpkin pancake.  It was huge!  And very delicious.  I typically like my pancake well  cooked and this one was a bit doughy in the middle.  The warm syrup was a nice touch and the side of bacon was delicious.  My friend got the classic breakfast and it looked very good.  All in all a good solid breakfast choice."}
{"text":"So simple and perfect. Was an awesome breakfast experience. Fast and accurate as I told our server I had to be to work soon. She was amazing. Kim was her name I think! Thank you! And will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint. I go here about once a month before an appointment in the area. I've tried a lot of their menu and have never been disappointed. I am a huge fan of their lemon ricotta pancakes and Florentine Benedict. Service is always quick, friendly, and efficient. I usually go alone and I never feel awkward about it here (even though when I worked night shift I probably looked like something from The Walking Dead!) When I try to be healthy I order the Tri-Athlete {egg whites | Crimini mushrooms |  onion | tomatoes | green chilies} or the Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl {quinoa | Italian sausage | Crimini mushrooms | tomatoes | kale | Parmesan | EVOO} and I am always pleased with how tasty everything is! I even recreate some of their dishes at home before those looooong 13 hour shifts on my feet!"}
{"text":"First time at First Watch.  Wife and I came up to visit an arboretum and this was where we had breakfast after our first night.  Not far from the Hotel.  Mary was waiting on a large group and seated us at a table.  I had the Inspired Italian omelet with potato chunks and coffee.  Wife had French Toast with melted butter, maple syrup and bacon and OJ.  The food was excellent, hot and tasty and made perfectly.  Coffee tasted great and an insulated carafe was placed on the table  so I never had to wait for a coffee refill.  Our Waitress (blond haired lady) was friendly and answered my wife's questions.  The atmosphere was a barnyard theme.  Tables were clean as was the floor.  Didn't visit the restrooms. Definitely return here in the future."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure why they call this place \"First Watch\", as I can imagine it's because somebody or something is waiting for the first signs of the sun to come up in the morning. I think maybe it's because nobody woke up at this place and/or somebody is watching for the first one to wake up?? Or maybe after the First Watch they all go back to sleep!!!  We were seated OK with awake people... But that's about where everything fell off back to Snoozeville. Our waitress was more interested in clearing tables than serving us. It all began when our water glasses were so dirty and greasy that  I mentioned it kindly to her.  She never showed up the entire service to replace them. I drank my water out of my coffee cup. My partner ordered coffee initially, she did bring us a pot of hot SOUR brew... We were going to change it out for decaf but we never saw her. I had to get up and go hunting for for the creamer since the only creamer on our table was flavored and the regular half-and-half was gone. Then, we waited 10 more minutes; and finally, asked the other waitress if she could find her, so we can place our order ... we were starving.  My partner ordered a veggie burger since it was almost lunch, and I ordered a tri-athlete breakfast; which consisted of a white omelette with pico de gallo, fruit cup and whole-grain toast. My partner's burger was OK, nothing that special. She said she would consider ordering it again, although it came with a plate of dry lettuce. My white omelette had the texture of being cooked in the microwave; In other words, it tasted like a piece of rubber with canned green Hatch chilies and a side of bottled salsa. My plate had a little water or grease on it and so my toast was wet. I was so hungry I ate it anyways instead of complaining to a waitress who never showed back up!  I guess the idea of this restaurant is awesome, but from now on for breakfast, I think I'm going to go to local places where they do care about what they serve people and how; Instead of a chain where they're just trying to get through their shift. It truly showed in this place that they were just getting the job done.  Sorry for the lack of posted pics here. But there was nothing that beautious to capture."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was good food excellent. They give you a carafe of coffee similar to a thermos with a lid. Coffee was good, but I'm one who likes to drink my coffee not sip it, so keeping it super hot isn't impressive to me as I usually remove the lid so it can cool a little. I had the blueberry pancakes. I can't eat as much as I used to so instead of the 3 stack I only got 2. They were Great! The only slight problem was, even as good as they were I couldn't finish them. They were very large. I probably should have gotten the single pancake. I didn't mention that it was filled with some of the largest blueberries I've ever eaten. Will I be Back? Most likely."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch. They have mostly indoor seating, but some tables outside too. I had the monte cristo, which wasn't the best I've ever had, but it got the job done. The service was polite and attentive. I did like that they had TV's throughout the seating area - a rare find for a breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"First time here. Overall disappointed. Food not prepared well. Potatoes partially burnt excessive amount of butter on toast. Utensils dirty with food particles on them. The waiter not friendly. I most likely will not return. I was really hoping this place would great to frequently visit."}
{"text":"We hit up First Watch this morning and my first thought was, \"boy! what a popular joint!\" The wait was quoted at 10-15 minutes but we were seated in else than ten. Service was excellent. Jenny enjoyed the waffle breakfast and I had an Acapulco Express omelette. Both were good and we cleared out plates, sipping on the coffee (caution: it's a strong brew) to wrap up our casual Saturday breakfast.  Not a lot of bells and whistles but First Watch seems to know what they're doing. Definitely a safe bet if you're looking for a dependable weekend breakfast stop."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so awesome, we ate there three times in the one week that we were in Phoenix. Everything is super fresh and the menu items are interesting with unexpected flavor pairings - we loved it all! This will definitely be our first stop on our next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"They have so many dishes on the menu I wanted to try and decided to try avocado toast the day I came in. Lots of healthy food options, it was perfect choice to take my friend out on lunch who just completed a full marathon.  It was a weekday lunch time and they were about 70% full when we walked in. After our server took our order, the next time she stopped by was after we finished eating. She forgot to bring a drink my friend ordered and my glass of water stayed empty for a long time.  Avocado toast was good, not the best I had but it had very generous portion of avocado. My friend really enjoyed his vegetable soup and roast beef sandwich. He said soup was one of better veggie soup he had and horseradish had great flavor. I am glad he enjoyed his food.  I really liked their concept of this restaurant and they had several dishes I wanted to try but I think it will be a while before I come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a two for one.   Sat on the patio since the weather was nice.   We had the chickicanga and the eggs benedict florentine.    I had the chickicanga.  It says it is wrapped in a tortilla but I was thinking it is wrapped in an egg frittata, which is fine with me.   The filling was tasty with the chicken, sausage, chilies and a bit of cheese.   The side potatoes were, well, meh.  Added some hot sauce to it from the little basket of condiments on the table.   That helped.    My companion had the eggs benedict florentine.   Actually, we took half of each home and I had the rest.   It wasn't bad.   Nothing to make it stand out.  She also ordered coffee, which they give you a pot.   I tried it.   Not bad at all.  I did like the coffee.  Our server was Jojo.  She was competent and friendly.     Would I return?   Dunno.   Probably would order something different if I did."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in Chandler.  The host was not thrilled to be there... but it was the day after a holiday.  The food was outstanding, well priced and there were plenty of healthy options.  My omelet was perfect and the sides were freshly prepared  and filling without being over the top like some breakfast establishments.  The kids menu was excellent and also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! Eat the pancakes they will make you happy. Service was great and food was crazy good. Try it! Thank you for feeding me First watch."}
{"text":"First time. ... Fanfreakingtastic!!!! 1/2 sandwich 1/2 salad. .. the Monterey Club is great but the Pecan Dijon  Salad is phenomenal!!! Open from breakfast brunch and lunch.  This is a great little spot on the frontage road heading north of Dunlap.  This is a definite must try.  Travis was a great server. Didn't try the juice bar but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the North Hills!  We've been waiting weeks if not months for this to open and it hasn't disappointed.   Use the no wait app to avoid the wait.    They provide a carafe of coffee at your table so you never have to wait for a refill, and they have three creamer options on the table.  The menu is pretty diverse from your classic eggs, meat and potatoes, to steel cut oatmeal and plenty of varieties of eggs Benedict dishes!  I tried the farmhouse hash which had fire roasted tomatoes, avocado, onions and potatoes topped with two eggs plus a side of potatoes and toast.   Needless to say, it was so much food that I couldn't clean my plate.  I also tried the seasonal cinnamon chip pancakes which were delicious.  Everything is tasty and fresh.  Great breakfast spot although it's about $10 per plate."}
{"text":"I love this place! Cool vibe, good food, excellent service. Our server was Kristie, and she was fantastic. She recommended the Chickichanga, which was dynamite."}
{"text":"Good food and an ok price. We were seated quickly. We were served promptly. The food is quality, but not quantity...not enough but it was definitely good. Would recommend to anyone visiting."}
{"text":"Oh good lord. The barbacoa eggs benedict. I mean come on. Coffee is excellent as are their other fancier drinks. The only thing I didn't care for was the Millionaire's Bacon but I am very very picky about my bacon so don't take my review too seriously on that. I just don't like bacon mixed with literally anything especially something sweet like syrup. Regardless, everything else I've eaten there is FANTASTIC. I hope they bring one to Surprise because I would eat there every chance I got."}
{"text":"Love this place no matter the location. The service was spot on to start. Our server was extremely helpful answering questions and directed us to several good items on the menu. The highlight had to be the ricotta pancake with lemon curd. The pancake was crispy on the outside, with a delicious helping of lemon curd. My wife had the juevos rancheros, which she said were nicely done the proper amount of heat. I had a veggie omelette which was chock full of goodies. Also had great coffee at FW. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The greatest most creative largest selection of benedicts of anyone out there. This place is super fabulous. Very healthy options that taste insanely great. Fabulous atmosphere, very clean and superb staff. I have yet to have anything from the menu that isn't out of this world incredibly Devine. Absolutey fabulous. Not a place compares to their creative dishes. Nothing is so overly creative to where you don't know what you're eating type of creative... It's all a creative as in their own style in presentation, seasonings and/or perhaps added fruit to a dish that one would not have ever had or seen in that dish before and it makes the flavor of that particular dish burst. They know what they are doing. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I had the salmon fritatta and it was meaty. Before, I had their power bowls and omelettes. I just like how their ingredients are fresh and tastes fresh too. The atmosphere was good and the service was nice. I'm not really a breakfast person, but I also been to a lot of breakfast places. First Watch is what comes to mind when I want to go to a breakfast place."}
{"text":"We've come in here and left a few times because the wait was out of hand. We finally got in without a wait on a very snowy Sunday. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. This place really needs to decide if it's going to have a health platform or not. It's like sort of healthy and fresh but with a side of bulk preservative food. I loved the fresh juice. I didn't enjoy that our waitress handed us our check with our food and never came back. We were already standing up to go pay when she asked if we were done. There were maybe 7 tables in the whole place of 30 tables that had people. I give this place 3 stars for the juice, wide selection, and the food was quick to come out. It's lacking in a defined genre of food, service, food flavor and while the place was near empty, they sat us right where cold air rushes when the door opens and closes."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast something a little different than the traditional stuff. I especially love their toast and house made jams. Decor is country chic and service is good. The coffee is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was delicious and the service was great! My server recommended  their fresh juice it was just what I needed. Will definitely pay this place a visit again"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place... the worst part is trying to decide what you want! The superfoods bowl is LIT, and so is the trifecta with scrambled eggs and potatoes. The new açaí juice is also super good. I mean literally we cannot get enough of this place and the struggle is real when you're trying to decide what you want. The muffins are also super good and the avocado toast is fire"}
{"text":"I'm am amazed at the service I got this time round the food looks great the waiter was so humble and beautifully kind I will definitely recommend to my friends and relatives now this experience has fixed my view on this restaurant as a unit I am highly satisfied"}
{"text":"Visited the Fulton Ranch location today. After an expected wait we were seated. Ordered the classic eggs Benedict. 30 minutes after placing our order our breakfast arrived. The eggs were over-cooked, both mine and my wife's. My plate was too small to hold the Benedict and the potatoes. When bringing this to the attention of the staff, other than providing an extra plate my comments were shrugged off. We'll not be retuning."}
{"text":"I've been to the First Watch location on Thomas a few times by now but this is the first time I've been to the location on University in Tempe.  I am happy to report that this location lived up to the very high standards set by my earlier visits.  The three of us each ordered something different and we were all very pleased with our choices.  I understand that Chef Sean has been with First Watch for five years now, and he is responsible for the inventive dishes on the menu.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly. Maybe their parking lot at this location could be a bit larger, but that's really the only \"negative\" I can think of and it's not really something within their control.  I always go for the seasonal specials (you'll see when you get there) and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town for a meeting and we were looking for a place to have a healthy breakfast. We are both eating Paleo. Decided to have breakfast here and I'm so glad we did! There are several menu options and the waitress was happy to modify things for us. The kale juice is amazing! We will definitely be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"First Watch has become my new favorite brunch place in North Scottsdale with extremely healthy options, solid coffee, and an open and lively atmosphere. The wait to get in is never super long, even on busy Saturday and Sunday mornings and the entire staff has always been incredibly polite and attentive.  For those looking for a delicious and healthy option, I highly recommend the Morning Market Veg, a veggie omelette with zucchini, crimini mushrooms, goat cheese and much more. Of course they have avocado toast, turkey omelettes, and other healthy options.  The best part of First Watch are the seasonal options, which right now include Huevos Rancheros Tostadas, Protein Pancakes and a SoCal Breakfast Burrito."}
{"text":"Amazing Florentine Benedict. I recommend that with an ice coffee and millionaire bacon."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, the food here seemed very fresh which was a nice contrast to the greasy diner fare we've been chowing down on during our recent vacation.  I got salmon benedict, the eggs were perfectly poached and runny, and the tomato really stood out and mixed well with the salmon.  Will definitely give this chain another try."}
{"text":"This place easily became my favorite breakfast spot. I love the healthier and wide range of menu items to choose from although every time I come in, I have to get at least one pancake. They're massive but too delicious to pass up! The only thing that has been slightly annoying is the service can be pretty slow. Because it's my favorite place, I go pretty often but sometimes it takes 10 minutes for a server to even greet us. But the food comes out quickly and it never disappoints. Also, the parking kind of sucks and I often have to park somewhere on Mill Ave and walk over since only a few spots are available."}
{"text":"I've been to First Watch a few of times, each time to serve only as a reminder why it's been so long since my previous visit. I'm always lured in by the promise of healthy dishes, and dazzled by the look of the place, but I'm disappointed regularly by the food. It just isn't anything to write home about. Eggs are routinely cooked incorrectly, the breads never seen fresh, the fruits are grocery store quality at best; I could go on. It just never seems to ever come together there for me.   From a marketing perspective, First Watch gets 5-stars, as it always looks and sounds good, but on the execution side, 2-stars is being generous. In the words of The Who, I won't \"get fooled again.\""}
{"text":"One of our favorite choices for breakfast. Lots of healthy alternatives. Service is always spot on. Prices are reasonable.  My wife loves their power wrap while I tend to order something heartier.  The Trifecta is among my favorites. They do a great job adjusting orders for special needs. Everything is fresh. They take the No Wait App to save time in line."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best place for breakfast . Everything is fresh and the crew is super friendly always greeting you . And doing an extra mile to please you and make of this the best experience."}
{"text":"Great place! We need more places like this around town. Good quality food at very reasonable prices and service with a smile. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, very clean and spacious. Servers all very friendly. Menu has plenty of options. Food was absolutely phenomenal both days highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is notorious for poor dishwasher. Every time we come in there is always specs of food on all of the dishware. Whenever my fiancé and I ordered, they always seem to forget the no butter request. Otherwise, the food is great and the staff are decent. The prices are OK.."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! This used to be The Good Egg, The First Watch bought the location, totally remodeled it and did an excellent job. The place has a modern hip vibe to the decor. Plus, the menu is fantastic! So much better than The Good Egg. Salad with breakfast sounds really weird to me, but the super light vinegarette totally works! The potatoes are some of the best I have ever had, perfectly spiced! And to top it all off, we have the best server, Ellen! She has such an incredibly great style, is very personable and got everything in our order correct! We have food allergies, so I certainly appreciate that, as we frequently have problems with that! We will for sure be back and will tell our friends and family about this place. I highly recommend. Just wish it was open for dinner too!"}
{"text":"My intro to FW came from a sample of a cucumber / apple juice drink offered @ my gym......my wife & I went to the Scotts. location for Sunday breakfast......a thoroughly enjoyable experience !  Susan had the Chipolte Chili omelet, while I devoured the Lemon Riciotta pancakes. The juice drinks were superb, as was our waitress ( Carley ) ; knowledgeable & friendly ( not to mention patient w /  an indecisive me ). With so many healthful  menu choices, we just have to return !"}
{"text":"For those that don't know my eating habits, I tend to stick to the things that I like. I find something and I end up pretty much sticking to it. First Watch is another one of those restaurants that has helped me to \"branch out\". I try to eat healthy for the most part and stick to their healthier part of the menu and have tried just about everything in that section and have not been disappointed. The Tri-Athlete Omelette and the Power Wrap are my favorite. Just the right amount of food to fill me up and get me going for the day.   I also enjoy the Lean Machine but, have heard some negative feedback about the \"bland\" turkey patty so be aware. My thought is that it is supposed to be healthy so I don't expect too terribly much from the patty of turkey. Especially since the rest of the meal is so perfect.   The service has always been great and the food has always come out rather speedily. One time the food came out in less than five minutes! After speaking with the owner, he let me know that they try to get the food out in under a certain amount of time. He stated the faster they get it out, they can keep from getting backed up in the kitchen. Haste does not make waste in this case at all. I always leave satisfied and look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"This place used to be a Good Egg and we didn't realize it had changed hands until we walked in the door. First Watch is a small chain (I think) but they focus on healthier and more locally-sourced fare than your average breakfast joint. There was an unsurprisingly long wait on a Sunday morning but we could have sat down at the community table. The service was friendly and prompt, especially considering the volume of people there. I could have gone for a larger portion size for the price but we were hungry to begin with so that might not be fair. I ordered something off of the specials menu with bacon and eggs and was pleased overall. I had to hunt to find something on the menu that came with potatoes since a good portion of the dishes come with greens as a side. If you want a reasonably sized, relatively health breakfast this is good, but if you really want to fill up this isn't the place to be."}
{"text":"The food was served fresh and fast. But mostly this 5 star review is for there seating system that texts you and tracks through yelp. It made the 20-30 minute wait easy to manage by running an errand while we waited for our spot in line. Kudos"}
{"text":"So first of all the guy who we picked up our to go food from was very rude and being a first timer it just made my experience that much worse! Once i opened my salad i realized they had dumped all the dressing all over the salad which turned into soup with lettuce and the dressing was warm so my salad was soggy and warm. Don't think I'll be coming back here"}
{"text":"First Watch always provides great food and first class service.  Joneen, Server, and Rodrigo, Server, are true professionals who always exceed my expectations.  There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding Joneen, Rodrigo and First Watch."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after a walmart run in west mifflin. A yelp search of healthy resturaunts in the area brought me here.  I adore the cute rustic feel to it. The menu had great healthy options. I went the pick 2 lunch option and chose the Monterey club and the chicken avocado chop. The salad was fabulous. It had chicken , avocado, black beans, corn, tomatoes, tortilla strips with a citrus vinaigrette dressing. Originally it is served with romaine but I subbed mixed green.   The salad was absolutely amazing I highly recommend it. I wasn't a huge fan of the club. I found that it has too much mayo (top and bottom bun) i didn't care for the cheese on it also.. It was too heavy for such a light sandwich if that makes sense. Loved the salad though"}
{"text":"Wow I have always wanted to try this place and I finally got to with my friend Katy. I had the pumpkin pancake breakfast with 2 medium cooked eggs with a chicken sausage patty and she had the biscuits and turkey gravy with medium cooked eggs. Yum O we will be back. Ethen was very nice and explained any thing we didn't know what that was on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is really good and servers were very friendly and caring. I enjoyed the morning meditation juice and the huevos rancheros... tasty!! Reason of only 4: Hostess/cashier - I almost left, not so welcoming"}
{"text":"I don't get to go here very often but absolutely love everything on the menu.  All very healthy selections.  I have not had their avocado toast but someone at my table did and while not a HUGE fan of avocado (I know that is blasphemous!) it is growing on me and their avocado toast has some egg mixed with it.  Going to try that next time. Food and service are bar none.  with many locations to choose you do not have a reason to go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had the Grilled Turkey sandwich. It was pretty good. Im not sure if it is supposed to be warmer or not but mine was just luke warm it seemed. Although, this sandwich being warmer would not have improved it. I think I just expected it to be warmer.  I opted for the chicken chili instead of veggies and the sweetened green tea for a beverage. The green tea is not overly sweet. I enjoyed a few glasses of it while I was here.  Price was decent. You do not get as much food as going elsewhere but the quality of the food seemed to be better. I do not think, for example, the food tastes nearly as fresh at Panera.  The waitress was attentive and smiled. She took care of the entire table very well. Dishes were cleared quickly and politely. Checks were delivered without asking (i prefer it this way as on a week day i think its safe to assume people are on a lunch break and running low on time).  Overall my experience was great with the exception of the crying child in the background. I do not fault First Watch for this but its worth noting that there were quite a few young children in here when we went. YMMV.  They have delicious chocolate mints for you to refresh yourself with on your way out. I am enjoying one right now!  -1 star because its not perfect. I cant put my finger on it, but its just not my favorite. It is likely that I would return!"}
{"text":"1st time at 1st Watch. All I can say it was perfect. Shannon was perfect and a ray of sunshine. I had the eggs, sausage and Belgian waffle. It was light and filling. I don't feel like taking a food coma nap. I will definitely have to be back here again Yummy is the word of the day, for this foodie."}
{"text":"Best place to have healthy and light food. Every time I visit, I make sure to order a new dish. To my surprise I have never found any dish lacking in taste. The customer service is really good and the waitresses make feel at home with courteous smile."}
{"text":"I've eaten there many times.  Nice people.  Good food.  They give you your own pitcher of water & carafe of coffee [very nice touches]!  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service with friendly and attentive staff.  Quiet music in the background and a wide open space creating a peaceful and fresh environment.  Great food options and decent coffee.  Beats Dennys any day haha"}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance...my bad. First time we went was months ago after they opened. Place had a refreshed look but was totally empty. Weekday morning so figured it was because they just opened. We love the FW at FLW and Scottsdale Rd, but this one was dead. Service was slow, food ok, no one looked happy to be working there. The person who looked like the manager looked out of sorts. So we got a flyer in the mail for a BOGO so I said let's try it again. My husband was not excited. I said \"Come'on. Maybe it's like their other location now that they have been up and running a while.\" But nope. The place was packed at 9am Sunday morning, we got the last booth and eagerly choose what we wanted to eat. Then we waited...and waited. Watched 3 servers come in and out of our upper deck area and bring food out, take orders, chit chat, remove plates, chit chat, bring checks, etc. For 15 min. No water in our empty glasses, no coffee order that we were dying for. One waitress seemed to only care for two tables, another one took care of the booth behind us, and third waiter cared for two other tables. We patiently watched...and waited. It appeared to me that the seven tables in our area were getting very slow service too. With three servers? Then a young couple was seated at a booth/table a few tables from us. I watched. Sure enough, the waiter went up to them to take their drink order within a minute. I lost it. I said \"Excuse me, can we order? We were here first.\" He looked up at us and said \"Just a minute after I get them.\" Instead of \"Oh sorry I'll let your waitress know.\" and go get her. I'm assuming it was the one girl who had waited on one booth next to us. So I said \"But we've been waiting 15 min!\" and he just continued to ignore us...so you know what? I'm ignoring them as a business until they go out of business. Sorry First Watch - I LOVE your food and amazing fresh juices and amazing workers and amazing happy place....but this place has none of that. We stormed out and told the next people walking in \"Don't bother!\" Two strikes...you're out!"}
{"text":"This was a great Escape from the typical breakfast places. Unique menu and very fresh ingredients. I had the Ham and Guyere omelette.  Full of flavor. My husband had the brisket hash and said the brisket was very tender and eggs were cooked just right. We also shared a Carrot Cake Pancake which was delicious. Customer service was on point. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Five close friends for lunch 3 of us sitting along a bench where our sweaters were being snagged by the rough backing one seriously to a sweater just recently purchased.   The manager's very disappointing response to our complaint was to offer her a free meal when she returned.   At this point  we advised we would not return and that is where the matter stands.   We will not recommend  your business to any of our friends. Besides that the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently after the first one opened in Cranberry Township. Now if you're a healthy eater, this place is for you. They have a lot to choose from, not just breakfast food.   FOOD: I chose the Tri-fecta, which is a Belgian waffle with 2 eggs and either bacon, turkey sausage, or sausage link. Of course I chose the bacon. What a great combination of sweet and salty! The waffle was lightly dusted with powder sugar and light to the taste, not heavy or thick tasting. The bacon was crispy and not fatty tasting. This meal was light but very filling. What a way to start the day!"}
{"text":"First watch could easily become 5 stars if the service team were trained properly. We would eat here more often if every time we came in the service wasn't so lax. The food is consistently good and timing from the kitchen is not the issue."}
{"text":"Refreshingly simple ingredients shine on this menu. I liked having healthier options, which are few and far between at a breakfast/brunch spot. The space is open, inviting, and bright. However, it does not absorb noise well, which is something to consider when bringing along grandparents or soft spoken friends/family."}
{"text":"Fantastic whole food.  Tasty and creative combos.  Best eggs!  So fresh and yummy.  I've had them scrambled, and then today I had the squash frittata from the seasonal fall menu.  It was very good.  The bread is scrumptious, and the greens are tender, fresh, and not bitter.  I like that the plate is not filled with potato.  First Watch seems to concentrate of a more balanced plate. Although there is more a look of sparsity, there is actually plenty of good, filling food that doesn't leave you with a lead stomach.  I tried one of their juice blends that had carrot, orange, lemon, and ginger.  Perfect balance.  Not too much ginger.  So refreshing! It gets a little crowded, but not too long of a wait for a table.  Waitress was very slow, so others had to help her out.  We still waited a bit too long for our food, and did received an apology for that.  Bathrooms are clean.  Atmosphere is open, clean, and comfortable.  Reminds me a little of the Good Earth that I grew up with in California.  If the First Watch offered homemade blueberry coffee cake, and some kind of outrageously powerful house blended cinnamon tea - their business would triple overnight.  Especially since so many people are moving here from being forced out of Seattle and the Bay Area.  The timing might be right.    Cons: My boyfriend and I enjoy going out to eat about 3 times a week.  He had the turkey monterey club with avocado and bacon.  He said it was \"good enough\".  But he thought the turkey was of cheap quality.  Bacon didn't have the best flavor.  I personally like that the water doesn't have ice in it.  But, it desperately needs to be filtered.  I call it \"fish tank water\" when the water tastes that bad at restaurants.  This is a big negative for both of us."}
{"text":"Solid choice for breakfast meals, even for lunch.  I thoroughly enjoyed their selection....So much so we had to order an extra dish to share so we can try more.  The shrimp and grits taste great...The grits were drier than I expected, but still quite good.  I also had one of their marketplace hash plates.  The combination of bacon, potatoes, avocadoes and other peppers worked perfectly.  Breakfast a lunch never tasted so good.  Also had the kale juice, and that was quite refreshing.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  Only drawback is that they close by 2:30 pm."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with lots of creative and healthy options outside of your traditional breakfast options. I wish they rotated the menu a bit more often though."}
{"text":"The service was great and very quick. The food was good but it wasn't hot and the portions were smaller than I thought they would be. The breakfast was good, but I've had better."}
{"text":"The waitress we had a fabulous recommendations and the food was out of this world amazing. We had the pumpkin pancake and a chickenmanga or something like that and the veggie sandwich.  I wish we had space to eat more we would have."}
{"text":"Very inviting fresh interior. Lots of reclaimed style wood and repurposed items that gave it a very clean and stylish feel. Wait staff was friendly and prompt. Had a party of four and out of our group only one of us would re-order what we received. I'll speak on my Eggs Benedict W/ Salmon. Bread was hard, possibly stale. Eggs were overcooked which left me missing that warm runny center.  The Hollandaise had a bit too much lemon in it and was thin as well. The portion was small which for the price would not have been off putting but since the dish was lacking on taste it felt like a slight. I wanted to really like this place but I can't quite move past two stars. I will most likely try this place again in the distant future and give it another shot."}
{"text":"First time here at First Watch. Enjoyed the menu selections and had a difficult time picking something. Opted for lemon ricotta pancakes with berries and lemon curd. Delicious!  Dining partners chocolate chip pancakes and chickychanga. Both were raving about their choice.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Great cor breakfast a and lunch. Sometimes a bit cold so bring a jacket or cover-up of you tend get cold easy."}
{"text":"Tried First Watch today with my wife, her mother and our 9 month old son.   Sunday morning at 9:30 am the place was busy but there are a lot of tables so we didn't have to wait to get seated. There we several other families along with couples.  I ordered chorizo omelet and my wife ordered the works omelet with a side of blueberry pancakes to share with her mom.  Pancakes are huge so usually one is enough. Omelets came with a mixed green salad which we thought was odd but I guess it's healthy. Food was good tasting. Service was good. Family friendly place."}
{"text":"A wide selection of healthy foods. Was introduced in November and going back this weekend."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for breakfast and lunch. Good coffee and always fresh and good food. It's a bit pricier than other places but for us its worth it to get fresh and healthy food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and last week and was blown away! All the food was of excellent quality and taste! I had the ricotta pancakes with the lemon curd and it was so good!"}
{"text":"This place is cute, delicious, and the service was great. There was nothing that was extremely stand out about it, but it was a nice experience. A trendy brunch place, if you're feeling that.   Best tip I can give is to call ahead if you have your heart set on eating here. If we hadn't the wait would have been an hour at 12:30pm... and they close at 2 so I don't know how that would work out."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the staff has been extremely friendly, the food has been very good, and the look of the restaurant as a whole is so cute. Definitely great for breakfast dates."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty busy on the weekends so expect a wait. We sat outside and dined al fresco while enjoying the beautiful weather. The food and coffee were really good but the service was a tad slow. It's a good brunch/breakfast alternative to the super crazy usual places. I'll be back. Too bad they don't have bloody Mary's and mimosas though!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff is very attentive and friendly. The only gripe I had when I ate here was the egg benedict. They used lunch meat ham vice Canadian Bacon or shaved ham for the meat. First time ever I've seen that.  I mentioned it to the server (who seemed to be the manager too) and his comment was \"we don't have Canadian Bacon.\" I said I know, that's why I'm suggesting it. I've never seen eggs benedict served this way.....ever. He said \"Yeah, we have a lot of customers who mention that.\"  Maybe it's just me, but if you have a lot of customers \"mentioning it\" then fix it. Responsiveness to your customers is pretty important.  Other food was fine. Not spectacular, just what I would expect."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast this morning and was seated right away. .we sat down and browsed the menu and in 20 minutes of sitting there we never even got greeted for our drink order so we left. . Very disappointing considering I really wanted to try this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch at First Watch this morning.  I had the Crocque Madam and it was EXCELLENT!  My husband enjoyed his Traditional Breakfast, too.  There was a fairly long wait (20 min), but once we were seated the waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Food is good, but the service is just awful. 8 tables with 7 wait staff and still the service made a Burger King employee seem overly willing to help."}
{"text":"Love the A.M superfoods bowl served with a slice whole grain artisan toast with almond butter sprinkled with sea salt, Yummy !! Definitely a favorite ! Cute little restaurant and great service as well...."}
{"text":"Love this place the food always is excellent no matter what I seem to order everything seems to turn out great this is my favorite place to go for breakfast. The price is very affordable too.  It is always packed but you don't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. I love the delicious fresh juices, chia pudding bowl -and every entree I've tried has been fresh and extremely tasty!  There tends to be a 45-1 hour wait in the weekends (as expected), although once inside the service is quick. During the week you'll usually be seated in 10 min or less. They offer daily specials, a family friendly atmosphere, and top notch food!"}
{"text":"If your looking for breakfast this is a great option. Was in the area from out of town and used the reviews to find this place. Does not disappoint and has several options to choose from. I went for the breakfast tacos. Delicious. Atmosphere is plea stent and restaurant is clean. Very friendly staff and would recommend this as a first option to look at."}
{"text":"We've been to First Watch before at other locations and have always enjoyed. The portion size is good, the dine-in experience is enjoyable with good staff and the taste is always on point. This was the first time we had take out from them. I got my staple: The Chickichanga and my wife got a good looking roast beef sandwich. Mine comes with home potatoes and fruit, but the 'to-go' portion of fruit was a little bit ridiculous! It looked like my 1/2 strawberry was fighting for space with the one slice of melon and sliver of pineapple. Come on First Watch, you can do better than that! If I could give a half star, it would be 3.5...but only on the taste."}
{"text":"We've been to this location about five times. They have never disappointed. The food taste fresh and they've always gotten the order right. My eggs are always cooked a perfect over-medium-just like I order (most places mess them up). The wait staff are friendly and attentive. One even gave my my pregnant wife a box of chocolates on Mother's Day.  We are usually seated right away, granted our visits have been when they first open because we are early risers. Now we are here on a busy Father's Day and we only had a ten-minute wait at 10am. The place is clean with a country, but not cliche, homey feel."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, service is good.  Lots of menu choices."}
{"text":"Good coffee and a nice menu.  They have some good healthy alternatives."}
{"text":"This is a solid 2 star restaurant... the extra star is for the Avocado Toast, and because I'm feeling generous after a positive experience visiting recently.  I've been to this location previously when it was the Good Egg, and I like it even more now.  The service was great during my latest visit, once we got our name on the list...   When I first walked in, it took awhile to get greeted, so I'm hoping that they work on that.  Once I figured out which desk (there are two) to wait at, someone approached to take my name and party size.    Side note: you can now use NoWait to put your name on the list ahead of time, so I will be doing that if and when I return!  First Watch has a decent children's menu... my kids liked their Belgian Waffles + bacon and fruit, and my parents enjoyed their meals too.  There are plenty of other breakfast / brunch restaurants in town, and this is a chain, but sometimes you gotta do it.  Decent prices, consistent service, convenient location.  There's typically a wait on weekends, so be forewarned, and use NoWait to put your name on the list ahead of time.  And yes - most of all: Avocado Toast.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - for sure above average...  Today was my first visit to a First Watch and I was pleased.  It was nice to walk right in at 11:30 on a Saturday and not have a wait at all... I met my friend (future yelper Jamie M) for brunch - First Watch was her suggestion and it worked out perfectly.  The menu reminded me of the Good Egg, but service was awesome, and food was good too.  Our waitress, Amy, kept my water glass full and let me tell you, I was thirsty today having run earlier in the morning - I guess I just needed to hydrate.  I went with one of their healthy options - an egg white omelette with veggies and salsa + an english muffin.  I substituted the fruit for cottage cheese and cleaned my plate.  Jamie had the roll-up breakfast sandwich - it looked good too.  Next time, I may take Michael C's advice an go with the \"Trifecta.\"  Go to First Watch for consistent food, great service, and a clean, bright atmosphere - yes, it's a chain and yes, it's in a stripmall, but if you look beyond that, it's perfectly fine!"}
{"text":"With my husband and son out of town, my daughter and I met a friend on Saturday for a girls' lunch... We decided to meet at this First Watch due to it's convenient location + the fact that at least one of us may be in gym clothes (ahem, that was me), and didn't want to deal with too much of a busy scene or a place that was all about seeing and being seen.  Upon entering, it was clear that there wouldn't be a much of a scene, as there were plenty of open tables.  That part was a relief, but we were a bit concerned to find several parties waiting and barely being acknowledged when half the restaurant was empty.  When we were finally acknowledged, the host / hostess were not the friendliest, approximating a 15-20 minute wait and forgetting to mention that we could have chosen to sit immediately at their \"community table.\"  We learned about that a few minutes later when another party walked in and sat right down.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait that long and we were seated at a comfy booth about 5-10 minutes later.  Service wasn't the best, as we had to wait awhile for our water / coffee / juice, but once we ordered, it all turned out fine.    One thing to know if you go here... Avocado Toast.  That is definitely the way to go.  It may be on a temporary summer menu, but my advice to FW is to keep that puppy on the menu forever.  If I come back, that is what I'll come back for!  I was also pleasantly surprised with the kids menu... my daughter had the eggs and bacon which comes with toast, fruit and a drink.    This location doesn't feel a ton like a chain, which I like.  The inside has a warm vibe, fun decor, clean bathrooms, etc... they also have a shaded patio, which a couple of brave patrons were sitting at despite the high temps in the 100s this weekend.  If they can get a strong manager in place and/or improve the service a bit, I'd consider adding this to my regular breakfast rotation for sure... especially if that avocado toast sticks around on the menu!"}
{"text":"As this location is in Cen-PHO, one may want to consider all of the other options available.    Portion size is small versus the price.  As breakfast ingredients comprise the lowest cost grocery item, I'm not a fan of paying lunch/dinner prices for basic breakfast.  If you are a light eater this may be your place.  Just remember this....if you are reading this review,  you are in the heart of good food; Central PHX...you have options!!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast. Had the Trifecta. Fresh ingredients and cooked.to perfection. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Returned and noticed marked improvement. Very happy. Our server James was most helpful and attentive. Right on the money. Food was good. Service prompt and courteous. Thank you James . Hopefully we can track tou down the next time we visit. Great employee guys. He is a keeper."}
{"text":"Best breakfast experience that I have ever had. The environment was nice and the service was super fast. My party was seated immediately and drinks were brought out extremely fast.  I had the Floridian French Toast and the fruit was fresh and the Kale Tonic drink was so refreshing and very refreshing.  Justin was our server and he was on top of everything; making sure our food was correct and bringing anything that we needed out. He is very nice and super attentive to everything related to us having great service."}
{"text":"First visit here on university near mill Ave.  great atmosphere, large booth/tables for us bigger guests (A+) Breakfast was great. Coffee and water pitchers on the table so no waiting for your waitstaff but the staff was always around to ask for anything you needs. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Having to downgrade a bit due to removing gluten free corn tortillas and replacing with wheat  version.  Sad and disappointed as I liked friends and family to be able to have anything they'd like for brunch/ breakfast instead of my gf lunch places.  I gave it a shot twice after the gf corn tortillas removed from menu.  The other 2 options are skillets and are ok.  I tried the huevos eggs but had to send back as the whites were raw and clear.  After 2nd send back we just paid for everyone else's food and left."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Quality food and affordable prices. They use real maple syrup. Coffee is above par. PJ was our waitress and she was outstanding. She made our meal even better with her impressive service. She went above and beyond. Highly recommend this chain and this location!"}
{"text":"I was so sad to see Good Egg go! I was also expecting to not like this place!   I was so wrong! Great options! The blueberry pancakes are incredible! They are browned to perfection and moist. 1 was enough to split.   I had the chorizo chili omelette.  I rarely choose this type of omelette because of how heavy they usually are (cheap cheese/ingredients) but this was perfect! It was actually pretty light! Very tastey chorizo and cheese. The sour cream is so freaking good! I attribute it to the good ingredients overall.   Everything just tasted a little more fresh and higher quality.   My wife had a turkey and bacon sandwich which looked great too.   We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This location is very consistent in terms of food quality and service.  Our kids love coming here too, which is a plus!  Love the farmhouse look and feel, which is expected from any First Watch location.  My only problem is we come here so much that even with such a large menu it starts to get boring!  Still love it though.  It would be nice if they had weekly or even monthly specials instead of the seasonal specials to help mix things up for those who frequently visit.  But that's not a location-specific comment, since I would imagine that decision is probably made at a corporate level.  I've been to another First Watch location in Texas a few times which was also great.  The company as a whole is definitely doing something right from what I can tell!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday and I ordered the avocado toast which came with eggs. Both were delicious! I also ordered the millionaire's bacon, which is extremely crispy. So if you are not a fan of crispy bacon do not order. My husband ordered OJ and blueberry pancakes. OJ was great, however the blueberry pancakes were dry. Large pancakes though, they did not skimp.  Also the syrup is watery. So it didn't help the dryness of the pancakes. Will still want to come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Best healthy brunch in town. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful. As for the food, it is always fresh, flavorful, and delicious! I am especially fond of their seasonal menus."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The healthy options paired with a trendy new earthy feel is exactly what was missing from bridgeville eateries. Will definitely recommend to a friend and I am guaranteed to be a frequent cus"}
{"text":"I had a birthday coupon for a free entrée so I decided to finally check out First Watch.  I was impressed with everything about my visit.   I came with my toddler twins (which even on the best days can be a challenge or cause glares from servers) but they grabbed me two highchairs quickly and helped us to our table.  It was definitely appreciated.   The menu had both breakfast and lunch options.  I was almost overwhelmed because basically everything sounded incredibly tasty.  I ended up ordering the chile chorizo omelet.  It was a smart choice.  I loved everything about it.  The chorizo had a great flavor with just the right amount of spice and all the ingredients were portioned appropriately.  I chose the potatoes as my side (you could also choose a salad) and they were tasty as well. My kids had the bacon and eggs.  We chose scrambled eggs and they were light and fluffy and the first thing the kids ate.  It came with a small side of fruit which was fresh and tasty.  They (surprisingly) wouldn't eat the bacon so I did.  It made me instantly glad they were boycotting that day because it was crisp and filled with flavor.  So much so that I almost ordered an extra side of bacon. The staff was extremely accommodating.  They were even helpful when my son threw his water on the ground.  They quickly brought a new cup and didn't give me any odd looks or make snarky comments about it (which I have actually had happen...).  They were attentive to our needs without being overbearing.  They also took time to explain the restaurant concept and menu to us when I told them it was our first visit. I'm not sure how often we'll be back because it is a bit out of the way for us, but I really enjoyed our meal and hope to return again soon."}
{"text":"First time there...food was FAR better than your typical breakfast dinner.  They had decent vegan options and great service.  I know it's a chain, but they could use a name change, thought it was a security shop or medical supply company."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon.  Maybe that was the problem.  We were told that the wait time was going to be 30-45.  We we're finally seated 1 hour in.  The service was horrible.  Drinks were forgotten."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been here, and I have to say.....I love, love , love this place! I tried the market skillet, and it was so amazing!! The mushrooms! The cheese! The potatoes! And any place that serves cage free eggs is a plus for me!! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I've been here quite a few times and the food has always been delicious. I went this past weekend with my brother who was in town and had terrible service. Server's name was Hunter. She was very nonchalant. Not very pleasant. And I wanted to order some more food based off of something my brother ordered and she didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. Just put the check on the table and said have a good day. Definitely need to have 1 on 1 with her about service."}
{"text":"This place is okay for a quick breakfast. The employees were very nice even though it was packed with customers. We were put at a table that I felt was too close to the door. Cold air was coming in and the crowd was too close for comfort. Luckily I sat with my back to them. I had the Via Vento omelet.  Unfortunately, I could barely taste and see the cheese. The potatoes were fine."}
{"text":"RARE was a Sunday we didn't spend here in the last year+. Previous reviews explain the steep decline of quality. We sat outside waiting for a table for close to 30 mins, able to see tables out back either empty or not cleaned to seat others. We finally get in only to witness the same cycle for new customers trying to eat (see pic). Wait staff is less than competent once you finally sit, seems no one is happy to work here anymore.  Our bacon came out half raw, brought back from kitchen only seared the 2nd time. This was the last straw. We have given this place months to get it right again, and it has not. Sad to say this place sucks now."}
{"text":"First time going and will never go back. Took forever to take our order. Ordered salad and sandwich and both orders came out incorrect and on top the bread had mold on it in plain sight. Very disappointed, we got up and left."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for breakfast on Sunday and everything was great. It was very busy but only had to wait 10min for a table. They have a nice seating room in the center with couches while you wait and can enjoy some complimentary water and coffee. They recently remodeled so I love the new modern/rustic decor.   Our server was Alexis and she was awesome. Kept checking on us to make sure we had everything and was very friendly and personable. We had my friends 1year old daughter with us and Alexis kept smiling and talking to her to make her smile.   I ordered off the healthier options and got the avocado toast with eggs (ordered mine scrambled). It was delicious and the perfect amount. The avocado spread was seasoned perfectly and the bread was so tasty. I also enjoyed a few cups of coffee that had good flavor.  Great option for breakfast. I will be back again soon!  Highly recommend and great place for families."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast spot! It is recently remodeled so it has a rustic modern look. Beautiful atmosphere and the presentation of the food is great! Makes its feel more cozy and a great spot to hang out and enjoy a hot cup of coffee and breakfast. It does tend to get busy but I have never had to wait long.   I went in today with my fiancé' s mother. She got the avocado toast and I got the protein quinoa bowl. Her toast was delicious, healthy and just the right portion. I didn't care for my protein bowl but the server asked if I would like to switch it out. I switched it out for the energy bowl which was granola, fruit, and Greek yogurt. It's was amazing! Great flavor and refreshing.  Our server was Joanne and she was amazing. Greeted us with the hot coffee and was very kind to switch out my food when I didn't like my first order without charging extra. Prompt service and very kind. Great spot for friends and family!"}
{"text":"Hip, fresh, opens earlier for their customers, friendly staff, overall comfortable and clean   Avocado toast with eggs:  Mushy fresh avocados on wheat bread with two eggs any style. Very simple and fresh. Love it and will get it again.  Kale tonic: Morning greens??? Yes please! A little sweeter than I image and hope they don't put any processed juices there because this sure didn't taste like what I make at home with fruits. But if you need your veggie intake, here ya go!  Cold brew: standard, chilled, refreshing.   Will be back again just because they're open early, they have free newspaper to read, calming music, oh so friendly staff and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Great food. Healthy choices with lots of flavor. (The goat cheese is awesome!) Not to mention their dishes are beautiful here. I will definitely go back. It's all around a great place to visit with your family, on a date or just to go by yourself and relax.  My new favorite place to grab breakfast with hubby. Not super into healthy food, but First Watch makes chocolate cake look like bird poop in comparison as far as looks and taste. ;)"}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday morning around 9-9:30. There was no wait. Our sever Jared was the best. My meal was just enough. I had the pumpkin pancake. The syrup was served in a glass bottle that had been warmed. Loved that touch. I am told the crepes were light and wonderful. My sweetie loved his potato dish. I'm a huge fan of breakfast. This place served both breakfast and lunch dishes. If ever in Phoenix again I will be back."}
{"text":"So, I never understand having to wait when there are very obviously tables available. It really irks me. Ok, wait 5-10 minutes to be seated in the same seats that were available when we walked in. There isn't a number of people waiting to be seated or anything. At least they have cold lemon water available.   I will admit the food was delightful our first trip here. It was especially delightful this time. Certainly worth the 5-10 minute wait for me! We had better seating this time as well. In the booth I felt the atmosphere was open and farm-esque.   I decided on the market skillet and a side of millionaire bacon. Admittedly, I expected a bit of a punch from the cayenne although I couldn't identify it. I like the spice much more then others though so, another person may taste it. The skillet? Awesome! The veggies were cooked great and weren't just a pile of soggy mush. The goat cheese was a perfect amount to cut with some tang. My over easy eggs yoked perfectly and I didn't have to add any salt.   Now, the Man was undecided between an omelette and a Benedict. He went with the Benedict and was not impressed with the smoked salmon. He didn't make a mention to our waiter that he found it a bit fishy for his liking so, we can't comment on how they would have handled it. I had a small taste and though it was fishy I think it may have simply been the process in which it's smoked.   My portion was large for me. I ate it all up. I would do it again in a heart beat. I'd even wait for it."}
{"text":"The pits man. my omelette was so watery and the \"vegetables\" were sparse and looked like they were canned. Our server lacked knowledge about the menu too. boo"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. Not my typical breakfast joint, but it was good. If you are looking for a hearty breakfast that is at good value, this is not your place. If you want a heathy option for breakfast at an organic, cage free, organic price, this is your place. It was good, but not a lot of food for the price you pay. A little to crunchy for my taste. All in all, if your into that style of place, it's good food. You will just pay for it."}
{"text":"As usual, First Watch has great choices and great food!  Loved the crab and asparagus omelet.  But the main reason for this review is due to our server.....Richie!  He was WONDERFUL!  We had two little ones with us and he made sure they were well taken care of the whole time we were there from fruit cups to crayons to whipped cream for our chocolate chip pancakes!  Never felt rushed and always had a smile.  It's very rare to find such a nice and attentive server these days at any restaurant.  I've had good service, but this was exceptional and deserved a great YELP review.  I sure hope the manager sees this!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Excellent service.  Great place for breakfast and brunch. The carrot cake pancakes  are amazing. Definitely try them. Only downside so far is they are closed at like 3."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place here in Chandler.  I have been to a different place in Scottsdale and I was impressed.  I am soo glad there is one closer to me."}
{"text":"The food here was incredibly fresh and oh so yummy! Clean open atmosphere. The perfect spot for an upscale breakfast. They even have a small coffee bar up front to enjoy while you wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a healthy option for breakfast. The service is always good and I never had a dish that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Today I had the opportunity to go to first watch for lunch I really enjoy their food it's a relatively busy place especially at lunch. But today was a terrible experience. I walked in to the restaurant and there was nobody at the front for about a minute. A young girl walks up and sits down a couple and I have yet to be acknowledged. Another group of people walks in and she proceeds to see them down. After sitting The second group she finally says to me I'll be right with you. After she says that to me she continues to go grab Some menus from behind the desk and sit down a few more people that were there before I was. And then a woman comes up to the front because she thought the Waitress was going to take her check and said she really had to go so the young lady proceeded to get her checked out still without getting back to me after she said she would be right with me. As I continue wait for about 7 to 8 minutes a group of three people walked in the young lady  asked them how many need to be seated? At this point I had to leave the restaurant because it was just very upsetting and unprofessional the way she was going about handling things I don't know if she forgot about me or didn't see me standing right in front of her face for 7minutes. I hope this location can get a little better organized so nobody else has a terrible experience like i did today. Thanks"}
{"text":"I just ended up joining my friends for brunch and I was amazed at how friendly everyone was. I really enjoyed being there. Everyone's food looked amazing"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for brunch, and it's no hidden secret either--there's very frequently a long waitlist on the weekends. Fortunately, they allow you to get on the waiting list before you leave the house, which is quite a nice feature to offer. Also love that they have coffee for you while waiting, giving you the feeling that they actually care about the customers from the moment they step in the door.  The rustic decor is comfortable, especially coupled with how bright it is with the large windows. The menu is pretty large, and we haven't found any clear favorites yet from coming here only a few times. There are lots of standard egg-based creations, and I really enjoyed their hashes, combining lots of different chopped up vegetables, potatoes, and meats into a tasty meal. They also have lots of things on the sweet side as well, from pancakes to waffles to fruit and yogurt bowls.  One thing I'm not sure about is why they don't have prices on some of their beverages on the menu! Makes it a little awkward when having to ask waitstaff about them."}
{"text":"Loved our breakfast/brunch here! Very clean and very welcoming. The prices are good and the presentation of food is great! We need a place like this in Colorado. The coffee is strong, perfect for our road trip back to Colorado."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh food. Loved it. Except, a ?major problem for me: dirty glasses and silverware. The water glasses placed on the table for myself and friend to drink from were visibly? dirty and literally had little food pieces on the outside. I work at a restaurant, so I know that nothing should be leaving the kitchen like that. We asked for new glasses and the same situation occurred again but i just disregarded it. When the food came, I opened my silverware and there were dried up food pieces stuck to the bottoms of my fork and knife. Additionally, our waitress visited us rather infrequently. I think we waited 20 minutes to order.   But, GREAT food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Salmon and Vegetable frittata, eggs overcooked, salmon in  clump on one side of frittata, no tomatoes, moms waffle arrived cold. First time we came here it was good, this time bad. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at First Watch 3 times in 6 weeks and really enjoy it. Great coffee, breakfasts and service. Either just two of us or a party of six we are always well cared for. Plus the Birthday gift certificates for a free entree were a fun bonus.  Highly recommended and worth a little wait if necessary."}
{"text":"Went a second time. Corporate office was responsive to the \"sweet egg\" mistake.   Food was great !"}
{"text":"First Watch is on every corner where I live, but it took a very long plane ride for me to finally try this place.  The decor makes you feel like you are in a sunny bar in the middle of the country side. This location (hopefully all) use No Wait through the Yelp app.  This location was very busy on a Saturday morning. I'd recommend putting your name down if you are in a hurry. Our party of 5 was seated in about 10 minutes.  The service was attentive and helpful. We had full waters and coffees during a very busy brunch rush. They have a very gluten free friendly menu, and it was very easy for me to order here. Friends had told me how great the \"Chickchanga\" was so I asked them to prepare it without the tortilla. It came out like a scramble, and was VERY tasty.  The scramble was very flavorful, and well prepared. Their potatoes were extremely bland, and I wouldn't waste the calories on them again. Most meals are served with fruit cup too! Hope you enjoy as much as we did."}
{"text":"Well... The food may have been a little closer to the mediocre side, but the service was great! I had what my gf always says as a \"boring breakfast\". Chocolate chip pancakes, and a side of ham and an egg. The pancake was a little dry but the ham was pretty good. Coffee was average, eggs were average. But they did have some decent things on the menu. I do like that they brought out an entire carafe of coffee, and water so I don't get stuck paying 2 bucks for a tiny cup-o-joe w/ no refill, or trying to flag someone down for one. Nice! But our server was great. She apologized for the OJ spilled all down the side of her previous to our visit. It did look bad though. lol. When I went to pay they were the guy asked me how everything was and what I had planned today. I sincerely appreciate people who enjoy their job, and make your experience enjoyable.   In short: Service, 5 stars.... Food 3 stars..."}
{"text":"I recently discovered first watch and love it. I leave feeling healthier rather than bogged down with greasy eggs and bacon. I love their healthy and organic approach. I've never had much of a wait at any location I've visited despite with other reviews say. I even went during their peak hours on a Sunday and did not wait more than 15-20 minutes for my food, which I did not mind at all. I highly recommend the cherry chicken quinoa bowl!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first ever FirstWatch experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my food. I love that they focus on healthy and organic food options. The only down side was the lack of friendliness from our server. His demeanor made it seem like we were keeping him from doing something better, as if we were inconveniencing him. Luckily the other staff members were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Tasteless thin room temp omelettes with barely enough cheese and topping to fill it."}
{"text":"Yummm! Visiting here from Georgia. Found this place on yelp and it was delicious. Very friendly servers and food amazing. Had Avocado roast and kale tonic juice. Sat outside and enjoyed the weather."}
{"text":"First time at First Watch and I loved it. I had the Farm Stand Breakfast Tacos -delicious! My husband wasn't quite sure so he stuck with the Traditional (eggs, sausage and potatoes with toast) and was satisfied. He did venture out and order the Kale Tonic. I had a taste too. We were both pleasantly surprised. Our wait time was less than ten minutes and the service was outstanding!! I look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Consistently tasty menu offerings, friendly service and to-die-for avocado toast. Happy to have the calorie counts posted on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there this morning for the first time.   Let me just say this place is amazing  very clean decorated really nice made you feel at home the food was unbelievable fresh , everything was just perfect.   And the service was flawless we had a lady that was so nice made us feel welcome. She made the entire visit awesome.  We will be back every week"}
{"text":"Came here for an early morning breakfast during a weekday. It was a pleasant surprise to see them not busy. Usually on the weekends they are packed. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict. My wife had the frittata rustica and my kids and the bacon and egg. The Benedict was was good. It had a lot of ham and the eggs were cooked perfect. It was definitely enough food for me. My kids enjoyed the bacon and egg and the frittata rustica was good. The only thing my wife said was that the kale needed to be cleaned a little better. Some of the stems were left in. Overall though, good experience."}
{"text":"We had breakfast this morning at First Watch; I   had the veggie omelet that came with salad and multi grain toast.  It was delicious. Our service was excellent."}
{"text":"So- I am 8 months pregnant with twins and was craving some truly tasty and unique brunch options to try out through DoorDash. I saw positive feedback for First Response, and having never been there before, decided to try them out. Boy was I happy I did! Generally, I am not an egg or an breakfast person... but I tried the elevated egg sandwich and it blew my mind. The combo of flavors were creamy with refreshing notes of citrus and peppery arugula to balance it out. Loved the brioche bun and crispy salty bacon...and the sandwich really stayed together for me, likely because of that delicious gruyere binder! I will definitely be back...and absolutely recommend that you try this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The inside is beautiful. Feels very warm and homey. My fiancé and I came here for breakfast recently and had mixed feelings. He is definitely the healthy one and I love carbs so I feel like we get a good review of a place. He got an omelette with toast and was very happy. He loved everything on the menu. If you are healthy this place is for you! I It was hard to find something other than salad and vegetables on the menu so I got a waffle and eggs. The food was good. The waffle was delicious but the eggs were a bit chewy. The bill came to almost $30 which is a little much for breakfast for me so we will be back as a special treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast today. This place is AMAZING!!! Staff is so friendly and attentive. The  food is fresh and delicious. JJ was our server and she is amazing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. It's much like Cracker Barrel. Everything was great until I found a black hair in my breakfast hash!"}
{"text":"Only the best brunch spot wherever I go!!!! I am the \"duke\" of my home town location in Vinings (NW Atlanta), so I was excited to see these all over the valley in Phoenix as well. This the consistent experience I'd expect, my Avocado Toast was on point, Kale Tonic was refreshing, and good coffee! Why don't more places pour the first cup and leave the pot? I am not a needy diner, but I can hit the bottom of a coffee cup quick, so this is a big help  Have never had a bad meal at any location!"}
{"text":"So I should start by saying I love breakfast. It's my favorite meal and many times I just repeat breakfast foods for lunch and dinner so I have high standards.  The logo and the atmosphere definitely make it feel like you are in a health food shop, not that there are shelves of product I think it is just the khakis and healthy disposition; really cool that they can make a breakfast place feel like something else - hope I'm not just weird and no one else gets that feeling. We were pretty happy with the way they leave the coffee pot and water pitcher on the table.  We drink coffee pretty fast and usually spend more time waiting for a refill than drinking, not the case here.  I ordered the Tri-fecta with French toast and eggs over-easy and the boyfriend got the Tri-Athlete Omelete.  I was pretty excited when it came out and I got blueberry spread stuff on the side (I'm a dipper !!) with my French toast. Overall good food, nice enough environment - I'd go back."}
{"text":"I took my family to breakfast and was extremely  impressed of how much they cared about the quality of the food, my eggs were not perfect and they made the decision to make a new plate instead of bringing it to me the way it was, i was happy yo wait a few minutes more to get the best smoked Salmon Benedict i have had.   This place is awesome, great food and great service, a rare combination!"}
{"text":"The menu here is incredible. The portions are large the ambience is good. People are friendly. Gourmet food at great prices."}
{"text":"We had family in from out of town and decided to meet here before heading to the airport.  We had 16 people in our party.  This isn't a huge restaurant so it is very impressive that they were able to take care of a party that large.  The staff did an excellent job!  The food was out of this world.  The service excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious food, a spectrum of options (healthy to indulgent). Breakfast sandwich on point. Avocado toast that inspires. (Still drinking my coffee. Please bare with my brevity here!)"}
{"text":"First time here and I was not very happy - the food portions for the price were horrible . But my reason for the 3 starts - the place was very very dirty , I can see trash on the floor. I had the trifecta and the potion off eggs was way to small . The hostess was very friendly - the seating area super dusty."}
{"text":"I went there on Thursday.  I had Eggs Benedict and it was delicious!  Excellent service and very warm, friendly atmosphere.  I really enjoyed myself and will go back again.  I've eaten at the other \"expensive\"  bfast place in CF.  Hands down. First watch was 200% better.  This was real food, not hoity toity crap that was awful."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch recently.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The service was good the whole time.  Food came out fairly quick.  We were never rushed. Really is 3.5 like the average shows.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any breakfast or lunch time food. Everything is soooo good! Freshly juiced drinks paired with my personal favorite French toast keeps me coming back time and time again. There is also a BLTE which is a BLT with egg! The decor of the restaurant is light and easy, makes you feel like everything is farm fresh. The wait to sit is worth all the yumminess First Watch has to offer!"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth and are going for a tasty brunch option just... go home (or go to Denny's). I'm not sure if First Watch knows what ricotta even is because the \"lemon ricotta\" pancakes I ordered came out with what appeared to be yellow frosting and artificial flavoring sans ricotta that was completely unappetizing. The pancakes were also very dry. Essentially what I got was a poorly made, single-layer, dry bread circle with dollar store-grade frosting. I totally get that their thing is healthy food, so why not stick to what you know best? You can't have a \"healthy\" lemon ricotta pancake- that's like trying to create a healthy doughnut.   The Nutella French toast was also on a ciabatta bun? Yes, you read that correctly.   I saw someone else write a review about the biscuits and gravy, which is what my friend ordered. I could not agree more, the gravy was watery and tasted more like Salisbury steak gravy than the traditional buttermilk gravy. I'd also like to point out the false advertising in \"biscuits\" because these were a deformed English muffin/hamburger bun combination that tasted nowhere near like a biscuit. Please don't waste your money.  Word from the wise- just play it safe and order eggs with bacon. You can't mess that up... right?"}
{"text":"The lemon pancakes are amazing!!!!! I had the most amazing server he was so sooo kind and patient. I always have a good experience when i come here!"}
{"text":"In the realm of breakfast restaurants, First Watch is able to hold it's own but doesn't impress.  We ordered the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the Classic Benedict.  The pancakes were a little much on the sweet side.  The Classic Benedict looked very appetizing, but the flavors were mulled by the pile of ham which wasn't as well prepared as the eggs that were on top.  The service was good aside from the fact of not getting told to go up front to pay and sitting for 10 mins waiting for the waitress to finally let us know.  With the destination so close to downtown Gilbert and having other locations like the Farmhouse, Liberty Market, and Snooze, we would be hard pressed to come back."}
{"text":"I went to this breakfast place after church on Sunday. I'd like the fact that you could check in with the yelp app and arrive without a really long wait. I found the kale smoothie tonic very good. I had ordered a chicken burrito breakfast and it was very healthy. I noticed a lot of the food on the menu was either Californian, and very healthy. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken me soo long to head over to Frist Watch for breakfast, but you better believe Ill become a regular real quick! Who doesn't love breakfast?  I know I do and Frist Watch is literally right down the street from me.   I started off with a glass of Morning Mediation, this is the only way to drink your oj! It is freshly squeezed orange & lemons with turmeric, organic ginger, agave nectar and some beet, but don't let the beet fool ya, this drink is what a sunrise would taste like. So fresh and yummy!  I also ordered some Million Dollar Bacon to share, these are amazing strips of bacon baked with brown sugar, black pepper and cayenne then drizzled with maple syrup. Oh soo good!  For my meal I ordered the Elote Mexican Street Corn hash, which was seasoned potatoes, roasted summer corn, chorizo and scallions topped with 2 over easy eggs and comes with warm tortillas, even though it's not 100% like Elote, this hash is pretty yummy for breakfast!  So far everything I have had at Frist Watch has not disappointed, can't wait to keep trying out their menu!"}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot! The Kale Tonic juice is the best and every meal I've ever had has been fantastic--avocado toast, sunrise fruit bowl, potatoes, chia seed power food--all amazing!! Really cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Really great food and pretty decent prices for what your getting. The only thing I have to say is their side of fruit is pathetic"}
{"text":"I like First Watch. If you have the choice though... the Cranberry location is much better. It's a little smaller and we have found the food and staff are just a little more \"on the ball\". The food is good, but I have never walked out saying \"that or this was amazing!\" I have however had the same things at the Cranberry location and loved them! I think it all depends on who is cooking?  I recommend anyone of their specialty items though, you know, the ones with the little icon next to them on the menu! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Nice little establishment located close to the I-17 they offer selections you can't find in major chains. They have a large menu for healthy options if that's what you're looking for and the wait time for food was very minimal. Excellent food, friendly staff, couldn't be more satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  They service is great, but the food is just lacking flavor.  Got the Traditional breakfast (Two fresh eggs any style with your choice of grilled ham steak, thick-sliced bacon, turkey sausage or sausage links. Served with an English muffin and fresh, seasoned potatoes).  And had the Skillet Hash - Farmhouse (Two cage-free eggs* any style atop fresh, seasoned potatoes, bacon, avocado, house-roasted onions and tomatoes, Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Served with whole grain artisan toast.).  Nice to see they have a lot of selections."}
{"text":"There is no better place than First Watch for a healthy breakfast. Their fresh pressed juices are amazing and not overly expensive. They have a good mix of healthy and indulgent on their menu which gives a nice variety for their patrons. Their eggs Benedict and wraps are excellent."}
{"text":"Such a excellent selection of food. Kim was our server she was amazing. They have fresh options and the eggs are all cage free. The place is set up very well and I like how you pay your bill at the front instead of having the server deal with it."}
{"text":"No need to describe the fresh tasting food they serve starting from the fresh squeeze juices. The waiting is a bit long but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Today was my first experience with First Watch for breakfast, and it wasn't bad.  Looking at the menu, there seems to be a good variety of items to order, and the everyone in the group I came with ordered something slightly different, all of which looked pretty good.  I got the Parma Hash, which was two eggs on a bed of hash browns cooked with sausage, mushrooms, and other goodies.  Overall it was a fairly satisfying meal.  The waitstaff were also friendly and pretty timely with their service.  I didn't have a bad experience, but at the same time I feel that there are better breakfast places to be had in Cleveland.  But not a bad place to hit up if you're going to be in the University Heights area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Staff is friendly and the restaurant  is cozy with great seating. I would  recommend  you giving it a try."}
{"text":"came here with the fam, and we all enjoyed it!  like the overall vibe/atmosphere: fresh, cozy, and hip, all at the same time.  food was delicious, wide variety to choose from. the price is right for the quality.  i shall be back !"}
{"text":"The food is very good & the decor & service are great. The prices are quite high & portions a little scimpy."}
{"text":"First Watch is good for a light breakfast as they really don't pile on the food.  The food is good though and the service is good too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them ZERO stars.   A group of us went in for lunch,  around 11:45 or so.  By 12:15, no meals had come out, so we began to ask questions. I ordered a half salad with romaine lettuce,  tomatoes and eggs-three ingredients!, and tomato basil soup.  Should have been an easy task, yes?  Not for the folks at First Watch. Couldn't get a salad with 3 ingredients right!  As the rude server  bought out bags of the wrong food,  I realize my hour for lunch is over and I've got to get back to work.  I am starving. Thank you,  First Watch  for your horrible customer service, rude servers and overall awful experience.  I'll never do that again."}
{"text":"First Watch has become my go-to brunch place in Cleveland when I want something healthy, affordable, and yummy. The place is always busy but the wait time is usually short. I love that they have free coffee at the door while you wait for your table. I appreciate the ability to pick from egg whites and cholesterol free eggs if your (healthy) heart so desires. Sometimes I consider this but it's blasphemy to pass up on an egg yolk IMHO. Don't miss their pancakes, especially the banana granola crunch! They are multigrain and huge and fabulous. Once I watched a couple next to me order two omelets and four pancakes, finished off with two bowls of homemade granola. Now they're doing it right."}
{"text":"Pancakes yum Customer Service yum (so nice!)  Thank you.  I grew up here and used Yelp to find a brunch place to take my parents to after coming back from LA for the weekend with my husband and we had the most lovely time there today.  Service with a smile, real hospitality. . .Our waitress had long, light brown hair -- don't know what her name was, but she seemed to be part of an excellent team @ FW. . ."}
{"text":"Yes, chain. Yes, suburbs. But this place has actual, quality non-gimmicky basic ingredient breakfast that is well prepared. They do have your basic overrstuffed omelet or empty carb pancakes. But they also have a set of delicious healthy options that's aren't just Quaker oats.  I had their quinoa bowl, subbed sausage for avocado for sausage.  Came with basted eggs, fresh kale, and a hint of citrus. Yes, that's right: urbanist health food. Best breakfast out I've had in a long while. If you wanna go full-on hipster, they have avocado toast. On thick harvest bread.  How ironic would it be to eat avocado toast at a suburban chain in a strip mall??? You'd be hipster of the year!!!  (FWIW, I'm not knocking the ridiculous omelettes or empty carb pancakes. I do love that stuff. But there's so much more! And you're missing out on a whole different and growing market. I just don't want mu breakfast putting me in a coma for the rest of the day.)"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait upon arriving which is expected on a Sunday brunch. My friend and I were put on the list, but did notice some parties were seated before us even though we had arrived first. So there may have been some confusion at the front desk? Besides that, staff was nice and food was great!"}
{"text":"This spot is great, a welcome addition to Tempe. The coffee was really good and full flavored, and the juice was just fresh squeezed. The breakfast tacos, beans, toast and jam were all spot on too. My server Sara was very sweet and attentive. I didn't have to ask for a thing!"}
{"text":"First Watch is awesome! Their customer service came through with a gift card  for two to eat breakfast, brunch or lunch at their restaurant because of my previous review--I had a complimentary birthday breakfast, brunch or lunch, but the hostess only took $2.00 off  my total bill when my husband and I were leaving. I mentioned this in my first review and First Watch Customer Service sent me a message to send them my contact information so they could make it right for my birthday. They did make it right and I am very appreciative of them for that. They will always have my family and my repeat business. Our waitress was fantastic! She was great at checking in with us and making sure we had  coffee and our food was delicious. She was very friendly and personable.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and fresh tossed greens. My husband ordered the works omelette with fresh fruit and sourdough toast. We ordered coffee, some of the best in Phoenix and cold water. Fresh, hot, delicious entrees for brunch. This restaurant is one of our favorites to dine at. I highly recommend First Watch."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, service is even better. Such great staff and kind hosts. Our server Ellen is always on point ensuring we love our family breakfast or brunches here."}
{"text":"Lunch today was a spur of the moment decision.  My big kid and I were in the area and we thought we'd pop into First Watch for lunch.  We walked in and immediately thought the place was crowded and there wasn't going to be a place for us to sit.  Quite the contrary, plenty of room and might I add there isn't any place like First Watch in the area.  Very chic and rustic.  The food is like nothing I've been to in Charlotte or the surrounding area either, by far, not your greasy spoon.  We were greeted by our server Kheelda.  She was very bubbly, pleasant and patient.  I had the double stacked egg sandwich and hash browns.  DELISH!  I could only eat 1/2 the sandwich.  My big kid had the choose 2.  Roast beef sandwich, he said it was the best sandwich he's had in a long time and he had the fully loaded cobb salad.    I like when you order coffee they give you a nice size kraffe for your table and a nice sized milk bottle size of water.    We will be going again...so many yummy things to try and hopefully Kheelda will be there too."}
{"text":"1st off......our server Trisha ROCKED!  Came here based on Yelp reviews......did not disappoint.  I ordered, Tomato basil soup and veggie sandwich combo... My friend kinda freaked since the menu wasn't like your typical IHOP.....she just didn't want to eat 'funny' food.......or as I call it....Fresh, farm to table cuisine.....lol    We got her a made to order omelette.   But after she tasted it she was pleased.  I will return if I have the time before going home.....It's a winner."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I risk there was one in the Northwest Arkansas area (home of Wal-Mart) and a fast growing area."}
{"text":"They have a lot of heathy breakfast options that look amazing and taste pretty good too. The only thing that I disliked were the glass water cups we got. Our cups were still dirty with lip imprints and things floating in our water."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and delicious! Can't wait to take some of my friends! The place is a lil small but it's worth the wait. Wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Over priced for pancakes and waffle and then given smuckers syrup. Small waffle and French toast you get two slices ... go to Cracker Barrel it's better and cheaper"}
{"text":"We won't be back poorly cooked scrambled eggs and bad service when we complained we received a full bill for the uneaten  food  we will not be back!"}
{"text":"I love the non standard breakfast options they have! (They do have your traditional breakfast though for you picky eaters) as well as their lunch menu! Have yet to have anything I didn't like from First Watch. Amazing food and wonderful staff! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for the first time with my sister and dad. The food was amazing and we really enjoyed it. On the other hand the service was terrible. The hostess seemed like she did not want to be here. Then the waiter barely came to check on the table and did not smile once the whole time we were there. He took 20 minutes to get water and then took another 20 minutes to actually come back to get our order. Honestly getting breakfast should not have taken this long."}
{"text":"Love this place, the service is on it.  They seat you and already have gotten your drink order started at the same time.  The atmosphere is quiet, and doesn't have the roar or move em in move em in out feeling like some places.  The food is of great quality, comes out incredibly fast and hot and not greasy, and best of all with service they act as a cohesive team.  The wait staff help each other, and also service taking care of payments, its just nice how this place runs like a well oiled machine.    Their omeletes are great and the potatoes, are made just like my german grandmother use to make.  Yum."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast stop in central Phoenix.  The pancakes are huge, the coffee is smooth and flavorful.  Service is friendly and your food is out super quick.  My breakfast faves are the various omelette sand scrambles, but my sinful guilty pleasure there is The Monte Christo.  Ask for extra preserves/jelly as it gives a great contrast in flavor.  It's probably the best Monte Christo I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service! Many different things to choose from. LOVE the different pancakes and omelets."}
{"text":"Food is okay but pricey. Wait staff very good. Depends if you want to spend more for organic or get a more plentiful breakfast."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a classic breakfast. Nice selection with seasonal choices. Had the Pumpkin Pancakes with some herbal tea."}
{"text":"This used to be The Good Egg and was purchased and remodeled. The Good Egg was decent, but nothing to write home about, so we were excited to give the new place a try.   As we walked in we were impressed with the new decor. It's kind of like urban farm meets steam punk. Very modern feel and clean.   We had a 15-20 min wait on Sunday morning, but they have a nice waiting / conversation area with very comfortable chairs and free coffee while you wait. This was a very nice touch. The staff/managers running the reception area were very nice and noticeably upbeat and enthusiastic, which is a nice change compared to most places these days. They also told us in the future that we can put our name in over the phone up to 30 min before arrival. That's a nice feature.  The menu is typical for a breakfast/brunch/lunch place. Egg dishes, pancakes, sandwiches, etc. The food matches the decor with kind of a modern farm twist on traditional dishes.   I ordered the Parma Hash (an Italian-themed egg skillet), and my wife ordered the Biscuits & Turkey Sausage Gravy with Eggs. For the kid we ordered the chocolate chip pancake with sausage.  Overall, the food was uninspired. Just like a Mexican restaurant can be judged by its salsa, a breakfast place can be judged by its breakfast potatoes. And the potatoes here are very blah. They have no color (a good breakfast potato should be browned), no flavor and seem like they are maybe just steamed in a big pot. A few of the potatoes on my plate were not cooked all the way through.   My wife complained that the biscuit was not hearty and easily disintegrated in the gravy. She also noted that the sausage gravy did not seem to have any sausage in it, or had been whipped to heavily, but noted that the gravy had good flavor.  The chocolate chip pancake seemed good and the kid enjoyed it.  The highlight of the whole meal was the toast! A thick slice of freshly made whole grain bread, lathered with melted butter. It was delicious!  I could definitely see going back here again for a light breakfast during the week, such as an egg and toast with coffee, but would never return for that traditional American breakfast we all crave on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"I am a fan already after dining here  only one time.  I previously ate at the location in Cranberry and thought I enjoyed that experience enough to be excited about visiting this First Watch today.  But I must say, this set up feels so much better and it tops the Cranberry location by far.  We were warmly greeted  upon entering and were quickly seated.  I am sure timing was on our side for getting seated right away.  I am certain  they  usually encounter  fairly large crowds on a regular basis because of their limited hours of 7:00AM to 2:30 PM Monday-Sunday.  They do suggest trying their \"Seat & Eat\" quick order option.  It's basically having  your order already recorded and once you are seated the food preparation begins.  The dining room is very open and comfortable.  The design is such that they can easily transform their tables and chairs into dining for 4 or 14 all with a twist of a table or two. Smart. From what I gathered, the rustic theme of the restaurant is centered around several of the oversized wooden beams that came from a barn that had been torn down and repurposed throughout the dining space. They have bushel basket light fixtures hanging from the ceiling which further adds to the theme as well.  But the real treat is their fresh and exciting healthy menu options.  The choices are plentiful and unique. One bite of my club sandwich and soup said it all.  They know what they are doing and they do it well!!  My friends salad was appealing and plentiful. We left feeling nourished and completely satisfied knowing that we chose right and decided we are going to make it a point to come here on a routine basis."}
{"text":"What a fantastic breakfast!  My family and I were wrapping up a quick trip into Phoenix and heading for California in the morning on a Sunday. Breakfast was essential after a long night and Yelp told me First Watch was the place to go. I am pleased to say Yelp was very very right.   I started out with coffee - they brought a whole carafe. Bonus points. No waiting for refills! We also ordered one of their house made juice concoctions (can't remember the name for the life of me) - the waittress brought us two for taking so long to deliver them (in reality it was less than 3-4 minutes?). I wasn't about to complain about free stuff!  On to breakfast.. I ordered the elevated breakfast sandwich. This was the right choice. If you eat here - have this one item if nothing else. I ordered a side of their special maple syrup covered / peppered bacon to go along with it. It was all fantastic. The sandwich really exceeded my eggspectations. :) Highly recommend.   Nitpicking: We waited a bit longer than we should've to be greeted at our table. This is the only thing I can complain about even looking for something, but I don't want to write a review that's all positive.. that's so unlike me!  Eat here, don't miss it if you're in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu, nice bright seating and friendly staff. Grab breakfast or brunch, it's all amazing!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast!  Always tons of heathy choices on the menu and something for everyone. They will even add/subtract items if you ask them to.  For example I added chicken to the triathlete breakfast.  Easily done and minimal charge!   Coffee is good and the fancy drinks are excellent also.   The wait times can be ridiculous at times but it well worth the wait for the food.  Plan ahead and leave early or use the No Wait app to get in line before you leave the house.  We had 28 parties ahead of us before we left the house and when we arrived there were only 8...15 minutes later we were in our seat."}
{"text":"Such a great-up for a breakfast!  Even the little grandchildren liked it.  I haveca hard time trying different items because I KNOW how good the lemon ricotta pancakes are!!"}
{"text":"Bring back the Good Egg!  These prices are outrageous. $5 for 1 pancake?  $8.50 for a piece of toast with some avocado smash and a couple eggs?  No way."}
{"text":"Needed a good american breakfast near the biltmore hotel.  Good selection and you can get lunch as well.  Reasonable prices ( much much better than the biltmore)  and friendly service. Was happy with my pot of coffee and my traditional breakfast plate."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and atmosphere. The smoked salmon frittata was tasty. The avocado toast looked nice with perfectly cooked eggs."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty.  I had the smoked salmon and roasted vegetable frittata and it was wonderful.  The service was quick and our waitress was attentive.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food although menu seemed a bit quirky.  Can't order just a cup or coffee (have to pay for a mini carafe) and egg dishes all had some twist.  Good breakfast although I'd you want good old egg and coffee breakfast I'd recommend Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Very consistent place for breakfast with the kids.  Pancakes are always terrific, and I like that I can order a single pancake (they're HUGE; if you're eating a stack of these, be prepared for a nap).  Servers are always super-friendly, and very attentive if the place isn't jammed.  Kids' meals are a terrific deal.   Nice that they have flavored creamers to go with the coffee.  Not as funky & flavorful as Matt's Big Breakfast, but no wait, and a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"We were so sad to see this was no longer The Good Egg.  We have tried the location on HappyValley and 83rd and both times disappointed.  Our food today at 83rd was cold and not very flavorful. My husband had the works omelet and the fillings were cold and the cheese was not melted. My potatoes were ice cold. Our server did try his best to make good.  It is also expensive.  For a good ole breakfast next time we will go to US Egg or I-Hop.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not worth the 20 minute wait for a table (even after using Yelp! wait list) then another 30 minute wait for the food that comes out cold. I ate it cause I was too hungry to send it back to warm it up in the microwave."}
{"text":"Like any other breakfast place it will be a 45-60min wait, at First Watch it was definitely worth it. This was my mothers and my first time eating at this lovely little place. The serves is awesome but the food was even better. Our server was Albert who was funny and told great story's. We got the Floridian French Toast and the elevated egg sandwich. It's was absolutely delicious! Also I had a glass of the morning meditation which is a juice of oranges, lemon, turmeric, organic ginger and beets. If only they had this healthier drink at other restaurants and coffee shops. I definitely recommend coming here and will hopefully be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is always been amazing there and they have great deal When my wife wants to go out to breakfast that is where we go  The omelettes are the best"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! I went after a long hike and it was nice and refreshing, just what I needed!"}
{"text":"Really good healthy choices for breakfast! My daughter is vegan and found lots of great entrees to choose from. We had a pot of coffee on the table within minutes, and the food was hot and fresh. Our server was really nice too! There were a lot of people there, but we were seated quickly. It was a great experience, and will make this a Sunday morning tradition!!"}
{"text":"Patio NO LONGER dog friendly- We walked there (since we live near by) for breakfast a lot and always brought our dog -- now only service dogs are permitted . . . even on the patio???"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! for the suggestion!  Im so excited to have found this little gem!  Super fresh food, exceptional service, and even perfect coffee!  We tried the breakfast tacos, which my husband highly recommends.  I chose the traditional breakfast-eggs were perfect and their breakfast potatoes were to die for!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service has always been slow...even when the restaurant is not busy. Haven't been back in months.  however, the last 2 times i have gone, the service has been much quicker so i increase from 3 stars to 4!  and downtown location is across the street from golds gym downtown so i may frequent much more."}
{"text":"Horrible service on both of my visits ! Undercooked tasteless food. Overwhelmed staff."}
{"text":"I am updating my review after speaking with the diligent customer service after my initial experience was fairly disappointing. The first time I went the waiter was sarcastic to the point where he was a bit rude. He is apparently no longer working at that establishment, which speaks to the care and customer service of First Watch. They contacted me and have followed up on my experience. Additionally, the first time the food was nothing impressive, but now I am not back a year later and I had a great experience. The waitress was very kind, let me substitute menu items without hesitation, and the food was delicious. I had the Elevated Egg Sandwich and my friend had the Farmhouse Skillet Hash. They were both very delicious and reasonably priced. The fresh juices are also very delicious."}
{"text":"Really bad service, I won't be back here. I wanted a to go box and I sat around for 30 minutes to no avail."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast experience. The ambiance here is great, the wait staff is friendly, helpful and engaging. Food was prepared very well. I had the elevated egg sandwich. It was super tasty, loved the faint taste of fresh lemon juice on the avocado mixed with the pungent tate of arugula. The bun it came on was OK, a little uninspired tho.   It's mildly pricey but a better value than some other breakfast joints we have tried."}
{"text":"Third visit today and did not disappoint!  Last 2 times I had the avocado toast , which is superb !  But I have been eyeing up other delish sounding menu items and wanted to get something different today.   I got the frittata rusticsa and it just might be my new fave!  Went with the hubs and he is totally addicted to the millionaires bacon.   I don't go out of my way to order bacon, but this is pretty darn tasty!  So tasty we ordered 2 orders,,,  one as an appetizer and one after brunch to top our meal off.   Hubby got the trifecta that comes with a waffle.   Again, not a food im in love with, but their waffles are incredible !!!!!   Can't wait for future visits to try other dishes !"}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for breakfast and or lunch and love their sandwiches and salad selections. Breakfast tacos are good too but today was disappointing. Food was tipid, biscuits and gravy not hot. Would not recommend this or the Salmon Frittata. This is a busy Sunday morning and it appears they need more servers as people are waiting and tables are empty needing cleaning. Two outdoor patios and only one being used but heat lamps are inoperative. Disappointed in this trip."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go with my family all the time. The food is great and the service is excellent.  Jojo is our favorite server! We are a picky family that asks for a lot of modifications and she gets it right!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with friends and we got right in! Love the atmosphere & our waitress was super nice. Would definitely come back and try their lunch."}
{"text":"First Watch is my first choice if there is one in the area I am visiting. Always excellent selection, pleasant wait staff, and fresh food."}
{"text":"Family and I have been here 3-4 times now over as many months.  The first time, we all really enjoyed it - decent food (portions not too big), shortish wait, ok service.  Today, we waited 15 minutes (as mentioned up front by the hostess) and then were seated in a booth.  The server came up to us and got drink orders and brought them back in a reasonable time.  And then, nothing.  I saw her bustling around for a good ten minutes - in the kitchen for most of the time, but then bringing food to one table, going to clear another table, bringing \"to go\" drinks to one leaving, etc.  She wizzed by, said \"sorry for the wait, be there soon\" and off again.    Meanwhile, at least three other tables who were seated after us were already getting their food.  She finally came back, apologized with the \"we're so slammed today\" excuse I expected, and then took our order.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and tasted nice.  No drink refills offered until we were nearly done.  And really, I don't like places that ask you first.  Just do it and let me decline if I don't want more.  After we finished, I took my ticket up to pay and the girl at the register didn't even make the smallest of small talk.  No \"how was it?\" or  even \"thanks\" after I paid.  Just mute the whole time.  At least the hostess said \"have a good day\" as I walked out.  I totally understand busy days, but you really need to have a better system as a server for ensuring you're meeting the basic unwritten time requirements for this sort of thing.  Don't worry, I didn't stiff her in the tip, I'm not a monster and I'll chalk it up to a bad day on her part."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for breakfast. Avocado toast is one of my top choices. Their seasonal stuff is good too. What's not to like, it's fresh food and it's a tidy place"}
{"text":"Went twice to this place for weekend brunches. I really love this place I wish they were open beyond 2 pm. The food is really good but what's really great is the quality of service along with the food goes a long way. I was too late to ask them to skip the cheese on my burger but they said they would redo it for me. Coffee isn't the best but goes well with the food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to First Watch and I will definitely return! This trendy cafe serves breakfast and lunch. Since breakfast is my favorite meal, I couldn't wait to check this place out.  I ordered the Trifecta. The eggs and bacon were perfectly cooked. The pancake was big, fluffy and flavorful. I also ordered coffee. They bring a carafe to the table which is the best way for coffee refills....no waiting! Plus there was a nice sized bowl loaded with creamers on the table.  They offer traditional breakfast items as well as unique offerings. There is something for everyone.  Plenty of seating, an open and well lit floor plan as well as outdoor seating.  We were seated as soon as we arrived and our server was friendly and efficient. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am giving it 5 stars!  When my husband and I drove away, I said, \"I think that was the best breakfast I ever ate!\"  We were planning to go to a competitor a mile or so away, but there was a wait and we decided to see what else was close by.  So we drove over to First Watch and neither of us had ever been there before.  Walking in, the decor is modern, yet rustic and gives an inviting atmosphere.  Our hostess and waitress were both very welcoming.  My husband ordered the Morning Market Veg Omelet with coffee and I ordered the Skillet Hash - Market and the Morning Meditation to drink (an interesting and not excessively sweet combination of orange, lemon, tumeric, ginger, agave nectar and beet!)  Hubby was impressed that he received his own full pot of coffee and it was very good coffee, not your standard diner fare.  Our breakfasts both had a load of fresh and delicious vegetables including spinach, Crimini mushrooms, shallots and red peppers - mine with delicious seasoned potatoes and topped with 2 eggs. Oh, and to add more deliciousness, there was mozzarella and herbed Goat cheese.  YUM!  Both dishes served with hearty artisan bread with crunchy seeds, toasted just right.  I left feeling very happy and satisfied.  There are so many choices that I want to go back and try, all with healthy and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"The food at First Watch is certainly an improvement over Good Egg of the last few years. However there was a menu item from Good Egg that I dearly miss. Typically each August they had the corn/bacon/onion/jalapeño/cheese pancakes served with honey - these were absolutely delicious! During the month that these were available we ate breakfast there at least four times a week. I so wish you would add these to the menu at First Watch."}
{"text":"Ok so I really missed The Good Egg, but was willing to try the replacement, First Watch. Wanted an omelet but the menu was filled with rather bizzarre combinations so I just got the traditional two egg plate. What could go wrong. First the scrambled eggs weren't even scrambed all the way, more than half of it was hard boiled. The english muffin was dripping in butter, and the replacement tasted like cardboard. Only part that was good was thr fruit. So the waitress asked me how was everything, and I told her.  she said yeah, thats why I don't eat here I don't like health food for breakfast. Wha?  I have had healthy food breakfasts that were outstanding, and why would she admit this to a customer.  I was not interested in anything else. Did assume shed take something off. Nope. Ok, no tip added then, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's too bad the decor is so outdated, because the food was very good.  Owner should look into some updating and I guarantee this place would draw a bigger crowd.  It reminds me of a chain breakfast place inside, but the food is much fresher and better tasting. Modern is the ambiance that Scottsdale people look for. You want an idea of what I'm talking about.......go look at the restaurant kale and clover."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, creative, and healthy breakfast/brunch alternative to the greasy spoon, carb-heavy breakfasts served elsewhere."}
{"text":"We found First Watch on yelp this morning looking for a new breakfast spot amd we lucked out. What a great spot.  Heather was a very good server and she took care of the kids.  My wife had the Turkey avocado benedict and she loved it,  along with a Cinnybun type pancake. I had the spinach avocado benedict and it was very tasty and fresh.  All the food was tasty and fresh!  Oh, I also had to try the lemon ricotta pancakes,  even though I could not finish them, they were a nice Italian twist and very refreshing.  I think we fpuns a new regular Sunday breakfast spot! Thanks First Watch for being on point!  UPDATE: We have been back three times now and enjoyed every time.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I happen to really like this place for breakfeast. I have been going to this location  and the other location for years and always happy with my meal. I used to get the Bubbas Benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. But now they make it with turkey sausage so I dont get it anymore. Now I get the eggs benidict. Its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it. Im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise. The waffles and french toast here are good as well. This place has burgers, salads, and sandwiches to. Prices are good. $5-10. I dont think they have anything over $10 on the menu."}
{"text":"We received a BOGO coupon for an entree in the mail, so we decided we'd try this place. I ordered the Farmer's Biscuit sandwich and hubby ordered the Chickichanga.  The apple butter tasted great on the sandwich, but there wasn't much of it on there.  The egg yolk was already broken when the sandwich was brought to the table and it was running out all over the plate.  The biscuit was a little dry and was very hard to eat because it kept breaking apart.  Our order took about 20 minutes to get to us.  I think you can get better bang for your buck at many other breakfast joints so I was glad I got a BOGO coupon to try it out."}
{"text":"Colorful menu has all kinds of dishes! I love the healthy way this place provided. Coffee is fine. Restroom is neat. Not noisy. Fresh fruit and vegetables. Clean restaurant environment."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is delicious, the staff are friendly and helpful, and its not too hard on your wallet. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the tables and seating are very close together and sometimes feels like your sitting with strangers or can't have a private conversation."}
{"text":"The breakfast has the best home fries in town, next to Harlowes in Tempe. The eggs are cooked perfect everytime. Alittle busy on Sunday mornings, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I woke up this morning with a rumbling in my tummy, so I called up a friend and we headed to First Watch. It is walking distance from my hotel. and I'm always looking for new places to send guests, especially in the downtown area!  I was really surprised with how generic the restaurant was when I walked in. I knew there were a few locations, but I didn't realize what a large chain it was until later, but I could feel it as soon as we seated. The decor left much to be desired in muted citrus tones and an unfortunate forest green.   I liked the menu and the daytime cafe theme. I had the Key West \"crepegg\"  (which is like a crepe inside of an omlet.. kind of..)and my friend had the fresh fruit crepe. The food itself lacked a pizazz I was hoping for, but was greatly improved by a generous dosing of \"First Watch Habanero Sauce\" (they have their own which I thought was cool. They seem to be very in to trademarking.) My friend was pretty disappointed that her fresh fruit crepe only had 2 kinds of fruit.  Our server was pretty lackluster as well. She actually dropped off our check in the middle of our meal and then went on break... I know this because she was eating a couple booths away from us. I had to flag down a different server anytime we needed anything until the end of our meal.  The food is reasonably priced and the portions are generous with a lot of diverse options, and can definitely cater to large groups with many palates. I probably won't be rushing back soon, I am pretty spoiled with Matt's & Palatte right in the neighborhood, I guess I'm lucky I don't have to settle when it comes to breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Cute, comfortable space. Short wait on a Sunday morning. Lots of things looked great on the menu. I had the chickichanga. Great flavor, potatoes were perfect. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Every year we head to Peoria for Padre Spring training. This is a MUST breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Wow. Simple, fresh ingredients. Really great food. Casual atmosphere. Our waitress Ivy was wonderful."}
{"text":"I got here around 2 pm for a snack and a coffee and wanted to sit on the patio, the staff was very welcoming. I then read on their window they close at 2:30 and felt bad keeping the staff there any longer. I already ordered my iced coffee (theirs is to die for, seriously so creamy, and delicious that I go out of my way to park and run in to take it to-go) then I told the staff I wanted to take it to go and get out of their hair and they were so caring and said not to worry at all and that I was more then welcome to stay. I did end up getting my coffee to go and let them close on time but the fact that they were welcoming and were not counting down seconds til the guests leave this really stood out to me! I have eaten here before this and the food was delish and they also serve cheesy grits which are not as common to find and they're my fav!"}
{"text":"First watch is an amazing breakfast and brunch place. We have one in our hometown in Alabama and decided to visits the Arizona location after passing by.   Our party of 5 was seated immediately and we were brought water to start. The hostess was very nice and very friendly. Our waitress was also very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Then we were offered other beverage options and our waiter took our order. Our food came very quickly and it was wonderful. The atmosphere is calm and casual and it is a wonderful place to sit and enjoy a healthy meal. However they do have some sweeter options like French toast and waffles.   I ordered the AM Superfoods Bowl to start and the French toast for breakfast because I just couldn't chose between the two and I knew I would share with my family. The superfoods bowl was something I wasn't sure about trying, but I'm so glad I did. It is now one of my all time breakfast meals. I even tried to make it at home - not the same haha. The fruit is super fresh and the granola and chia seeds give it the perfect added crunch. It is also served with their amazing toast covered in peanut butter/almond butter. The French toast is amazing for a sweeter option. It has a delicious taste and is cooked to perfection. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. The biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, traditional breakfast, it's all amazing. I definitely recommend First Watch!  Photos to show delicious meals!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I'd been wanting to try it. My wife had been there  before and wanted to get my perspective.  It was ok.   Anytime, you get seated and have to wait about 5 minutes for coffee, it's not a good thing. The server was preoccupied doing anything else but waiting on us. Did I mention, I had to ask for a water refill??? They place a glass water bottle on the table for your own refill but I guess he didn't notice it was empty...  The food is good but its definitely not worth waiting for; luckily we were there before 8am. I don understand waiting in line for this place.  My wife had oatmeal and fruit and I had there breakfast chicken chimichanga and they were both fine.  The million dollar bacon though... that is really good!   If I decide to go again, Not likely, I will get the million dollar bacon to go.  Higher Grounds is across the street. And most of us know how good that place is :)  #supportlocal"}
{"text":"I loooooove the options they have here. Ive been here every week since ive tried it. I liek that their portions arent tiny. Some of my faves are  the Elevated egg sandwich, Avo Toast and the pesto chx bowl"}
{"text":"Service was great. Our server was attentive and courteous. The place wasn't bustling the day we went, so others may have different experiences on the weekend. Parking was a pain but when we finally got a garage spot - which is free! - we were close to the first watch entrance at the top of the stairs.  Food was delicious. I had a bacon avocado omelette with cheese that was pretty on par with other tasty items I've had at other First Watch locations. The bf had breakfast tacos which were free, using a birthday coupon from the First Watch email list.  Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Organic and amazing. Great price too I never turn down first watch and always hit them up in my birthday for breakfast"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit this First Watch Café regularly for breakfast while we're out for our morning walk.  The food is GREAT... lots of healthy alternatives.  The coffee is outstanding.  And the staff is super friendly.  It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I love the healthy food options- I've never had a bad meal for breakfast or lunch. The wait staff in Bridgeville, Robinson, and Ross Park is personable and friendly. It is always clean, warm environment, and all around enjoyable! Farmhouse skillet hash is my usual go to... and I couldn't love it more! Give it a try- you won't be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, right by the Abele office park, across from the Children's Dr office. Open rustic bright atmosphere with grainy wooden tables with comfortable seating. Happy hostess greeted me at the door. I'm a sucker for \"water service\" (reusable chilled water at the tables) menus on nice paper, no laminate so it feels they'll probably recycle before they get nasty! Couldn't help ordering same thing two days in a row: market hash with eggs over easy! Definitely enough for a meal and some snacks! Fresh flavorful well prepared and presented. Even love their take away boxes! Recycled paper! And cups are recyclable or compostable. My kind of place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went with the family to get breakfast. It's located in Fulton Ranch area so convenience was definitely a plus. Wait staff was nice and restaurant was definitely clean (high chairs especially). Ended up order the biscuit breakfast and the Belgium waffle breakfast. This was essentially where he down turn happened. The sheer wait for food was very long...my kids were starving and so was my wife. The wait continued until we finally got our food hoping for the wait to be worth it. Sadly, it was not. For the price the amount of food was definitely lacking. My potatoes were soggy and the biscuit gravy wasn't really gravy. It was more like water mixed with sausage bits. Luckily the waffle was decent and the eggs were cooked well.   Overall, we'll likely not return as Eggs N Joe is way better and now it looks like they'll be opening really close to First Watch."}
{"text":"It's a chain, it feels very chain-y, but if you want a fast breakfast or brunch with free wifi, it'll do. I like their omelets, they're ok (a touch on the bland side, but hey -- when most of your clientele are very old or very young, what do you expect?), and they're good about filling requests such as omitting the English muffin, but the coffee is average at best. If I really want a GOOD brunch in the Lakewood/Rocky River area, I'll head over to The Shore."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out. I got my order to go. Unfortunately, I found the host/cashier to be very unfriendly. I walked in smiling and went to the cash register, the gentlemen looked at me and said \"Hey\". I was surprised but I let him know that I had a To Go order. He doesn't say anything, just walks away to grad it. Hands it to me, and let's me know my total. No additional comments, courtesy questions, nothing. I looked in my bag, and noted there was no plastic utensils so I had to ask the guy. He seemed annoyed that he'd have to go get them out of the back but then remembered there may be some at the cashier stand.   Once I got to work, I was bummed I didn't ask for ketchup for the potatoes. Oh well. Wish it would've been included or at least offered.   I ordered the chickichanga. Very good. Very fresh. Potatoes were fresh too. Even the hair I found in my food seemed to be fresh. Sigh.   Oh well. Hopefully the service and experience are better for everyone else today."}
{"text":"This location redefines healthy in its truest ways. You can see it and taste it in the food. Clean and modern feel to the layout. My favorite side was the pancakes because not to many restaurants know how to make them. The perfect pancake regardless of the flavor is one the has a slight crispness on the edges and soft but still dense for the middle. Excellent verity of each menu item. If you like a dense coffee like they make at Starbucks you'll like this one."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came in to enjoy brunch this afternoon around 2:15 pm. The host/manager who greeted us seemed very agitated that we arrived nearing the end of the shift. We ordered promptly and were conscious that we were going to expedite our meal so the staff who didn't make us feel welcome could go home. Ethan was our server and he was very polite and courteous. Ethan made us feel comfortable given the circumstances. I had asked Ethan for another order at 2:30 after we placed our first order around 2:20. He was more than happy to accommodate.   My frustration is with the host or manager whom walked up and interrupted us and advised Ethan that the grill is turned off. He must be the manager because Ethan took his word and advised us that the grill is off and he can no longer accommodate our needs. Correct me if I'm wrong but A grill is not needed to cook a few eggs and potatoes.  A Range and skillet can be used for eggs and potatoes. Lastly, I'm sure the bacon is pre cooked or prepped prior to shift.  Coming from an Owner/GM of a restaurant myself, the host/manager was very unprofessional. This is the service industry. A successful restaurant is hinged on customer service, that which was lacking here at First Watch.   I am Not discounting the Cusine. I really enjoyed the Chickenchanga and the Carrot Cake hot cakes. Very delicious.   Unfortunately, I will not return. The lack of accommodation the unwelcoming host/manager and unprofessionalism that was displayed today is what frustrates me to no end. Especially when this is perceived by a general manager of a restaurant that prides itself on customer service.   I advise all patrons to visit Matt's Big breakfast. Conveniently located across camelback, in the Safeway strip mall. MBB always makes me feel welcome and is overly accommodating even if you arrive 20 minutes prior to close!  If you hold customer service to a high standard, visit Matt's Big breakfast and NOT First Watch."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I hope it didn't hurt the hostess when they removed her personality because they did a good job of it because there was none left. The waitress was friendly when she took our order, but we did not see her again  until it was time for the bill.The food was good but the staff needs to learn some skills"}
{"text":"Really wanted this place to be great. First I wanted to start off with the good things. Decor is clean and inviting. The weight of the fork was great , silly I know but I really noticed this fact. Now to the not so good, bland omelet. Does healthy need to mean no flavor?  Ordered Chrizo pepper omelet. I expected some pop and there was none. A few small bits of Chrizo and hardly no filling in the omelet. Good whole wheat bread. Music was much too loud for a Saturday morning breakfast, it may be fitting for a late brunch or lunch but I like to relax in the AM. Service was average and I felt as if the server was not listening to what we said. When reviewing the new menu she seemed to be in a bit of a rush for us. Coffee was good but nothing outstanding. Will have to go back for a lunch to see if things are better or worse."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Everyone was friendly, the food was very good, and we did not have enough to wait to be seated. It does take a bit longer than some for the food to arrive, but this is expected in a better quality place as this is. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on our way to the Verde Canyon Railroad (highly recommended).  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and other pancakes will never measure up now. They were light and tasty with fresh strawberries and to-die-for lemon curd on top. Hubs had the Italian sausage scramble and really enjoyed it. He really liked the coffee because it was nice and strong."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to the airport after checking out the menu! It was fantastic. The avocado toast was so satisfying and they didn't slack on the Avo. Great flavors. The kale tonic was delicious too! Great service and food."}
{"text":"Do people eat breakfast at Phoenix!?  We showed up to First Watch to get some energy for our shopping extravaganza at Nordstrom Rack.  It wasn't very busy and we were seated rather quickly.  I took a look at the menu and it reminded me of J. Christopher's in Atlanta....although the food taste 10 times better!  Danielle ordered this huge biscuit with sausage and eggs and I ended up trying one of their banana and granola pancake with a side of eggs and potatoes.  The portions are really huge and well worth the price.  Not a bad place if you are just craving breakfast."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've been to other First Watch restaurants and have been totally satisfied.  However, the experience today was anything but satisfying.  We arrived and there were a couple of people ahead of us.  I put my name down and was told there would be a 10 minute wait.  The host proceeded to seat several people that had arrived after us.  25 minutes later we taken back to our seat.  10 minutes and no one had acknowledged our presence.  At the 15 minute mark someone came over and gave us water.  At the 25 minute mark, someone other than our waitress came and asked us what we wanted to order.  She took the order and disappeared.  20 minutes later, our waitress shows up and asks us if someone had taken our order.  We said someone had and so she left.  15 minutes later she comes out and tells that she didn't think the other person took our order because our order wasn't in the kitchen.  We told her that the other lady had put the order on a ticket.  She acted surprised.  She said that she'd go find it.  10 minutes later she comes out and says we need to reorder because she can't find it.  Another server overheard this and told her that our order accidentally was put in the wrong stack of tickets and that they were making our order now and we would be the next order up.  10 minutes later our food arrived.  I ordered soup and some country fried potatoes to be made extra crispy.    The soup was just a few degrees above cool.  The extra crispy potatoes some crispy potatoes, but the majority of the dish had burnt crumbs.  Our waitress came back 15 minutes later to ask how everything was.  I said, it wasn't.  She said sorry about that and left.  She came back a few minutes later to clear plates from the table.  My wife asked for a take-home box.  She said, she'd get it right away and left our bill.  10 minutes later she still hadn't come back so we wrapped my wife's food in a dirty napkin and left.  Needless to say, the tip was not a big one.  I was quite surprised that no one took ownership for our experience.  Not even a manager coming over to say, I'm sorry.  Most places after this kind of experience would have given us our breakfast free of charge.  So if you want to be treated like a piece of dirt and not treated like they're glad you came to their restaurant, this is the place for you.  I will go back to First Watch again, but not this particular location."}
{"text":"We are road tripping Brooklyn to Texas and after spending the night in Pittsburgh we are headed to Nashville. First Watch was the best. Great atmosphere fresh ingredients and tasty."}
{"text":"I had the avocado, tomato, bacon hash and it was delicious. My bf got an omelette, we can't remember what it was called. He also said his food was good. Service was just okay it took them a while to get our drinks."}

{"text":"It was ok...nothing special really, although I just had the basic eggs, bacon, english muffin, and hash browns.  The service was so-so.  Again, nothing special.  If you want an ok breakfast at an ok price, then go here."}

{"text":"Mmmhmmm - get in my belly. This place is so good. The staff and environment is great. I'm always excited to go here for a weekend breakfast. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at first watch, Thomas road, recently. My husband ordered french toast for $9.00 and was appalled that he got no meat with it. It was two barely egged pieces of bread..very disappointing. Not even potatoes, or a little fruit. Just two pieces of bread. He was mad. I got the traditional two eggs scrambled. My eggs were maybe three tablespoons of egg which at my house would have been the equivalent of one small egg. My potatoes were basically a baked potato cut up with nothing on it, completely flavorless. No crispness what so ever and dry as a bone. Today, at home, I made two breakfasts of whole wheat french toast (very easy my friends), with butter and syrup and bacon and yummy french roast quality coffee and we calculated the two breakfasts cost about a total of $5.00 (I got 18 large eggs on sale for $1.29). My point is this: if a restaurant is going to offer something that anyone can make for a fraction of the price, don't you think it would be a good idea to give them something really special, especially if your charging about $30.00 for two people, out the door? ......Ok, didn't take up offer of free food because I'm not looking for free food, I'm looking for good food and at a good value. So we just went again because we got a two for one coupon in the mail, and I had the sweet pecan chicken salad...for breakfast. It's very good. I guess you just have to know what to order. Changing my two stars to three."}
{"text":"The location is great. Lots of parking. The interior is decorated well, not the usual old grimy chickens and cow figurines that often clutter breakfast spots, but rather a clean and modern look. The food was fresh and delicious. I had the tri Athlete omelette. The vegetables were cooked properly and the fresh bread was thick and accompanied by fresh strawberry preserves.  The wait staff was very friendly and prompt. They left a bottle of water and a pot of coffee on the table for instant refills. Definitely a repeat needed!"}
{"text":"Love this for breakfast and lunch! Staff is extremely nice, cold brew is delicious and haven't found a plate we haven't loved! Farmhouse skillet is my absolute favorite but the blte sandwich is a close second! Plus who doesn't love a restaurant that leaves a pot of coffee on the table?!?!?"}
{"text":"Food is amazing & great service!!!  I came here on a saturday morning so it was very busy and we had to wait a little for a table. The wait was not bad and the servers were super nice! Although the entire restaurant was packed, there was always food coming out and our server checked on us as much as possible.  I got avocado toast on gluten free toast with two eggs, and the yogurt bowl with granola and fruit that came with a muffin of my choice! Everything tasted fantastic, this is definitely my choice of place to go for brunch."}
{"text":"My first time here with my girlfriends. The menu is full of tasty selections. I ordered the market veggie sandwich which came with soup or fresh greens. I opted for the soup of the day, which was Italian wedding. We all had different selections and all agreed that the food and service was excellent. I would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and service  Avocado toast is great and all the fresh juices. May have a small wait time on weekends but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"First Watch is a UPGRADE Breakfast, Bunch and lunch everything tastes GOOD fresh and HOT and it's not loud and uncomfortable, waitress are all nice and polite and happy serve you with smile, not like DENNY's on 7th St Camelback or IHop on Central Phoenix . Even BETTER than MATT'S BIG BREAKFAST downtown Phoenix, no hard uncomfortable chairs to sit in while your being rush.  Finally find a descent place :-) ."}
{"text":"Needs more seating room inside but besides that the place is good. Had too many people standing around waiting for a table. Since its getting closer to summer it makes sense to see why no one wanted to wait outside in the waiting area."}
{"text":"I typically love this place. I came here on a Thursday at 145pm. The place was empty, normally I'm here on a weekend morning when it's busy. All my food was ice cold when they gave it to me. It also tasted super old. Why? There wasn't anybody in here! Terrible."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything is just so freshly made and delicious! The inside is very nice and cute and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, having been here at least a dozen times before.  I even signed up to their breakfast Sun e club.  Today I went with a friend for breakfast, and could tell something was off.  One of the glasses on our table had an old lemon seed in it, no big deal, I just switched the glasses with another table and let the server know.    I ordered the traditional breakfast with poached eggs.  My expectation of a poached egg is that it's cooked on the outside and runny (or at least somewhat) on the inside.  I've had these here before and they were perfectly cooked. However these poached eggs today were solid cooked all the way through, one of them had even apparently broken in the water and there was just a hint of yoke left.    I asked our server, very nicely, if they could be remade.  After 15 minutes of waiting, and after my friend had already finished her breakfast, we were presented with the check and were informed that there would be no eggs for me, the charge was taken off the ticket, but that, per the manager, I still had to pay for the coffee that I drank!?!  I requested to speak with the manager and explained how upset I was that I could be treated that way...how does a restaurant let a customer walk away without their meal?  Without any communication on what happened, or if an alternative would work? Did they run out of eggs?  Did the stove break down?  I'll never know, but what I do know is I was made to feel like I was refused service for sending back my poorly prepared order.  The only reason I didn't give this rating 1 star is because the manager ended up comping our bill, but I still left with no eggs.  Moral of the story, if you send your food back to be remade you may not get any at all.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Good food, a carafe of coffee just for me, and wifi to work by.  I'll take it.  First watch is first class!"}
{"text":"Get there before the church crowd and you've got it made!  Even with a full lobby, we have never waited longer than 20 minutes on a Sunday morning.  We have gone most Sunday mornings since we moved to the area and always have a pleasent experience."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes to be seated Monday morning. We were taken to a table outside, and handed menus. We sat for 15 minutes with no contact. Then we stopped the host/manager? As he rushed by and told him no one had come. He rushed off mumbling. We sat for 10 more minutes and then left. On our way out, I told the host/manager? That we gave up. He said, \"oh, ok.\"  This was out first visit, and wow.... I can't believe we had this experience when there is so much competition in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yelp you didn't do me wrong..... this place really is outstanding.  We were here on a Thursday morning, and it was packed.  The food is super fresh, and well done.  The server recommended a freshly pressed juice to my husband, and he took her up on it.  It was amazeballs!  It had Orange, Ginger, Beet, Tumeric, and Lemon juices.  I don't drink a lot of sweet juices, but he pressed a sip on me, and holy moly, it was good.  I joked to him that all it needed was a shot of vodka, and you would have a master crafted cocktail.  The service was excellent, and we didn't want for anything.  I was quite happy with my omelette, although I found it a bit odd that it was served with salad greens, instead of potatoes.  My husband had huevos rancheros tostadas.   He was all about the clean plate club.   From what I gather, this is one of a small chain of breakfast and lunch restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here."}
{"text":"My go-to place when I want plenty of breakfast options & 0-little waiting time to be seated. No matter how full it looks like it is, I've only had to wait to be seated once & that took all of 5 minutes.   This is a breakfast & lunch restaurant & is not open for diner. I must confess, no matter what time I've been, I always have breakfast, so that's all I can review :D My favorite omelet is new on their menu, the Ce La Vie. It's  roasted zucchini, onions and tomatoes with herbed goat cheese. It comes with just the right amount of potatoes and an english muffin. I always switch out the muffin for wheat toast.  When I'm ravenous & I want something a little heavier, I like the bacon and onion hash.    The staff is always so friendly & our waitress always remembers us, even when she's not our waitress :)"}
{"text":"OMG. I had a good feeling about this place based off of the pictures and I was correct. The kale tonic is life.. I would literally jump on a plane to go back to AZ and get one- bring it back to Cali. You NEED to try that.  Then I had the Salmon Fritata- Idk why I thought it was a salmon lox bagel- don't judge me. I had seen a picture, saw the word salmon and ordered it. It was really good!!! Its just the right portion (about the size of my palm) and it comes with a small salad. I would avoid the bread it comes with bc the butter was very salty.  I also ordered a wheat pancake bc why not? The banana crunch with added strawberries, and I would do it again. That pancake was probably the best pancake i've ever had.  I need another one with a Kale tonic and i would be a happy camper.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Everything I've had is delicious & fresh! The chia seed pudding & waffle are my favorites. No other breakfast place can touch it in the phoenix area for an all around experience."}
{"text":"I wish we were visiting Phoenix for longer because there were several things on the menu that looked really good!  Our server Patricia was very helpful in helping me narrow down my indecision. By asking me a couple of questions about my preferences, she zeroed in on the Floridian French toast for me. My partner had the avocado toast. Both were excellent!   Great food. Great service. We'll be back when we are in Phoenix next time!"}
{"text":"Strap in for a full-immersion homestyle breakfast/brunch experience. You'll be planning your next visit before paying your bill.  There are few breakfast eateries that compare to First Watch. We have been here several times and I'm ashamed it's taken me so long to sing its praises.  Here goes.  This past Sunday, I met Ellen and Linda. Ellen was our server. She was prompt and friendly with an awesome dash of sass for fun. We had a great time with her.  This go 'round I ordered one blueberry pancake, two pieces of bacon, and a ham steak. Darcie ordered the Traditional Breakfast with eggs over easy. The pancake was golden brown deliciousness. Frankly, that pancake has been on mind since (and it's Tuesday folks). It was perfection to start, but First Watch gives you a tasty blueberry syrup chock full of blueberries... so good. The bacon is always spot on. I truly enjoyed my ham steak (I add Tobasco for a little zing). Darcie's Tradional Breakfast allowed me to steal some excellent fresh seasoned potatoes. Got the evil eye a few times... worth it. She loved the eggs with the whole grain artisan toast and all-natural preserves. She also got a crazy good pear cider with her meal.   We loved it. All of it. And we really appreciated Ellen as our First Watch ambassador of tastiness.  While paying my bill I asked for a bag of their granola To-Go as well as a brief word with the manager. That's when I met Linda. I let her know that we've be in several times and each visit has been a generous 360° helping of exceeded-expectations. Ellen was outstanding, the food was stellar, the atmosphere was great ('80's and '90's music). FW just knocked it outa the park... we were leaving Big-Sigh-&-Smile type satisfied.   The restaurant was quite busy, but Linda made our very brief conversation feel relaxed and friendly. She's a winner too.  Restaurants rarely get positive feedback. While Yelp does provide a means to let services know a user's experience, there's just nothing like telling a restaurant manager that you had a great time and why. It's a real boost to everyone there, the manager, the server(s), and the kitchen staff. Please follow suit. It'll make ya feel good too.  Thank you Ellen, Linda, and everyone else at First Watch... owners included. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this First Watch because there rarely is a wait and the food is always good. I came for breakfast this morning and I got the avocado toast and over medium eggs. Prices are inexpensive- for breakfast burrito, avocado toast and eggs and two blueberry pancakes, the bill was less than $30. The only thing I would say to improve is the service. It wasn't bad but not great. Just \"hi\", \"you want coffee?\", \"you ready to order?\" and they drop off check. I guess they can be a little more friendlier."}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning, I wanted to go somewhere where they make me breakfast and I didn't really need to \"get cute\", just \"ready\". haha. I pulled up my yelp app and found First Watch. I put my hair in a ponytail, put on some jeans and a shirt and off we go...  When I got to the parking lot, we found a spot quickly - which means: not busy, no line, yes! We walk in and yup, it wasn't busy - empty tables everywhere. We were seated right away and our waitress was nice, but curt. I ordered the market hash with overmedium eggs. The market hash included seasoned potatoes, crimini mushrooms, zucchini, onions, red peppers, spinach, melted mozzarella and goat cheese. It was so freaken yummy! Once our food got to our table, we rarely saw our waitress.   Here's the problem: in the middle of us eating, the waitress drops off our check to have us pay up front. Right after that, the service practically stopped. We had to ask her for a to-go box and she didn't even refill our water cups. Once we got up to pay, we saw a long line of people waiting to check out. It was like waiting in line to buy the new iPhone 7! I'm exaggerating, but seriously - they should do this differently especially since they had empty tables and weren't too busy.I think it wouldn't hurt to have the waitress take our check with our card, refill our cups while we wait, and drop it to us. That small two minute process right there would've given her at least another $2-3 in tip. Instead, we waited in line for at least 10 minutes and paid.   The whole dining experience took about 40 minutes. I like that it was that quick and I didn't have to wait for a table, but I don't like the fact that you feel like you are just a number and once the check is dropped, on to the next. They are big and not as busy as let's say Matt's so let's bring back the customer service.  If I could rate just the food, I give it four stars. Service was two so overall, three stars."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the food we had here for breakfast. It was so good!   I have visited the other location on Thomas and it was definitely forgettable and service was not great. We came to this location and there was a 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning but you look around the restaurant and there were at least 4 or 5 empty tables. They were definitely understaffed, which also impacts the service. When we finally got seated, it took 10 or so minutes to get water.   Since the waiter took 10 minutes, it gave us the time to look at the menu so when he dropped the water off, we told him we were ready to order. I ordered the avocado toast (recommended by Gabi M.) with overhard eggs. Hubby ordered a blueberry and carrot cake multigrain pancake.   The avocado toast was everything I expected it to be - delicious!!! Good job, First Watch, for keeping it on your menu. The pancakes weren't bad either. I actually liked the carrot cake better than the blueberry one, but Hubby liked the blueberry one better.   Our server wasn't really around for the rest of the dining experience after food was dropped off. He did drop our check and told us to pay up front, but that was it.   Our bill was rather inexpensive so I was delighted about that. Overall, service and efficiency needs to improve but the food and value are pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent food paired with great service.  The staff is accommodating and friendly and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I made my inaugural trip to First Watch a few days ago, and it did not disappoint! I went with two of my boys. They ordered from the kids menu, and I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with a side of potatoes, and the Morning Meditation drink. I have one word....amazing! The eggs were cooked to perfection. The Smoked Salmon was delicious, the tomatoes were fresh, and the bread did not become overly soggy. I could have done without the purple onions. The potatoes were a nice side compliment to the main course, and were very flavorful. Lastly, the Morning Meditation (Orange, lemon, turmeric, organic ginger, agave nectar and beet) was completely refreshing, not to mention really beautiful looking.   The only issue that I had, was that I could have eaten 3 of these meals. But really, it is nice to not be overly stuffed, and feel completely refreshed.   This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  5/5 for me!"}
{"text":"Second visit. First was good. Today, we ordered eggs benedict. The yolks were hard, the teaspoon of sauce was hardly substantial (We wondered if the cook owns the sauce) and our server did her best to school us on her New Age drivel. Wont be going back!"}
{"text":"PHOENIX, AZ: Just finished a pleasant brunch at First Watch.  The cute little cafe serves fresh breakfast/lunch fare and has some nice options.  I had the eggs Benedict with ham, tomato and added avocado.  It was a 3-4 star experience.  The toast was a little burnt and the ham was a little overpowering.  Otherwise it was good.  I also tried the sourdough French toast and it was Excellent-5 stars.  Delicious berry sauce, cinnamon accents, and fresh butter.  It was wonderful and highly recommended."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Matthews!  Loved everything about it.  Awesome food!  Awesome atmosphere!  Awesome service.  We sat outside on a tasteful patio. Great chairs and tables. I had an egg white omelet with turkey. It was so delicious.   The inside of the restaurant is such that you want to hang out for a day or two.   This is s breakfast and lunch spot.  Really good salad, sandwich, and breakfast options.  Fair pricing.  Clean as a whistle. You, whoever you are reading this, MUST GO.  I am excited about this restaurant and you will be too!   It's a WOW!"}
{"text":"Going up to 5 stars, just gets better every time we go.  Quick service, delicious food, the right amount for the price.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always good healthy food  Friendly staff They have vegetarian options too Wait time can be long book ahead at nowait app"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, facilities were clean, ingredients were fresh and healthy. This would be a place I'd frequent. My complaint is the serving sizes for the pricing. One of those needs adjusted. Other than that, good job!   Whole-grain pancakes had a great texture and nice flavor. The BLT eggs Benedict was very light on ingredients for the pricing but had great flavor. Really enjoyed our breakfast, but was hungry in a couple hours."}
{"text":"Five stars because although there was a small problem with our order regarding quality, the manager took care of everything! Hey, bad things happen sometimes, but the way that first watch handled it more than made up for it."}
{"text":"I was seated quickly and the waiter was in training. I was first skeptical and thinking our service would be slower but the new waiter was wonderful. Super nice and helpful! The iced coffee was simply delicious and I went with the eggs Benedict-florentine. Wonderful! The girls I was with got the avocado toast -now I can see what all the rage is about - and the other got the French toast. All the food was amazing, loved the atmosphere. When I visit again I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Yum! My new fave breakfast place. I was a Good Egg fan (the restaurant that was here before) but this is even better. Healthier, yummier options. Coffee is great and they've got those flavored nondairy creamers that I love. Staff was a little slow, but super friendly and helpful. My only request is that they start carrying gluten free bread!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and came here with a few family members. The service was EXCELLENT! Our server was on it and never missed a beat with our drink refills. The food was decent, not the best ever, but it was good for what it was. Wish they had a spot like this everywhere I went."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to breakfast spot but it has been inconsistent during its transition period to First Watch.  I'm updating my review after giving up on this place then giving it another try...  The menu is great, atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, and if the service was better I'd give more stars. It seems to be improving but very disorganized, the food is probably worth the snags in getting service, I'll be ordering takeout though!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and plentiful.  The menu is creative and fun. The ONLY slightly negative... the service could be a bit better.  My home fries, when I got them...... while perfectly seasoned and cooked, were clearly left to sit a a bit before being served as they were barely lukewarm."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person in the least.  I'd rather just eat some oatmeal at home.  That being said, everyone that I'm friends with seems to love breakfast.  I had a visitor in town who wanted breakfast so we decided on this place rather than attempting to wait it out at Matt's.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have a whole section of healthy choices!  Another reason that I'm not a huge fan of breakfast is because it always seems to be about a million totally unhealthy options.  First Watch calmed my fears of having a way too high in calorie breakfast.  They had a whole section of their menu that had healthy options on it!  I'm a fan of that.  I ordered the power wrap which had some great veggies, turkey and egg whites wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  The mushrooms were amazing!  It was served with a very modest side of fruit and salsa.  My dining companion used to be a regular at this place so he had a whole slew of things on the menu he had ordered previously.  He got the chickichanga and was happy with it.  I enjoy the name of some of their menu items.  Chickichanga, chickichanga, how fun!  Our service was efficient.  I asked our waitress about some of the options in the healthy stuff section on the menu and her reaction was funny.  She told me that if you like 'that kind of stuff' the power wrap was probably the way to go.  Despite the healthy section of the menu, I guess some of the staff aren't down with it.  Amusing.    Despite not being a breakfast person, it's good to know that First Watch has some options that won't leave you feeling guilty all day about breakfast indulgence."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.   Really enjoyed their fresh pressed juices.   If you are looking for a casual breakfast place with quick service I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is usually one of my favorite places for breakfast at work, food is always good, fresh.. today it was not .. it saddened me.. based off past experiences I would give this place a 5 but I know there's always one offs. This time my food was cold. Not even just warm.. but cold.. the avocados looked real old & were mushy too.. hopefully it doesn't happen again if I decide to try it again."}
{"text":"20 minutes to seat, outside very limited water misters that dont cover the patio,15 minutes for water, 20 minutes for food. Server didn't want to work and it showed. Other servers came around but ours stayed inside. One server came out to the middle of the patio and asked who had what as she didn't know what food went with what tables...sorry , this place isn't The Good Egg .. We will stick with US Egg and few miles down the road."}
{"text":"We were seated right away because of this handy app, that was pretty awesome. The coffee was good and so was the orange juice. I ordered the breakfast sandwich. It was okay, very dull in flavor. It came out on a regular hamburger bun. I was a little surprised. You guys advertise organic awesome food, yet you served a very pretty sandwich on a hamburger bun? Would have been better on an English muffin, crossiant or even a bagal. My husband order the farm breakfast. Sadly he had to put so much ketchup and salt and pepper on it because it was so bland and boring, he didn't finish his meal. It was WAY over priced for a boring flavorless meal. I don't think we'll be returning. Our server was great, very friendly, kept our drinks coming and always had a smile on her face. I doubt we'll be returning. When you guys decide to step up the organic game. Reach out, maybe we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a business meeting and found First Watch not to far from hotel. I am so glad I skipped breakfast at the hotel.  The food was delicious. I chose the multi grain pancake with blueberries along with the million $ bacon.  But what totally won me over was the morning meditation juice. It reminded me of a tequila sunrise only this was healthy. The one item I was unsure of was the beet juice and even asked if they would make it without it, but was convinced  by the waiter to try. I am so glad I did.  Never thought I would have beet juice but the mixture with orange and lemon juice, turmeric and ginger was an excellent combination. My coworker had the chicken chimmichurri hash which she indicated was excellent as well   Definitely looking forward to another business trip to Phoenix. My only question is when will they expand to Southern California!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited First Watch for the first time this week.  We had never heard of it before, but had looked on Yelp for someplace new to go for breakfast.  We had a FANTASTIC breakfast!!  We shared the Millionaire's Bacon, which was incredible - both sweet and savory at the same time.  I also tried the Strawberry Smash, which I thoroughly enjoyed.    We enjoyed sitting in the open-air area of the restaurant.  Even though it was a tad noisy from the traffic, we loved the fresh air.  The service was great and friendly.  This is my new favorite local place for breakfast, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You know. The fall special of roasted butternut squash and quinoa was delicious. I enjoyed the meal immensely. The restaurant itself was well lit, clean, organized and efficient. Soup was a tomato basil which was smooth and flavorful. The wife got a turkey sandwich with Cobb salad. Turkey sandwich was a touch soggy but far from inedible. Overall we will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Monique was our waitress and she's awesome. I had the egg tacos and loved them. My assistant had some kind of pancakes I couldn't stop eating. The place was busy, but very organized and service was great. The restaurant has a good mix of people from young to older"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal. Their food is fresh, delicious, and innovative. This is definitely a place to put on our return list."}
{"text":"The service was awesome! The waitress, Paige, was amazing! She was attentive enough without smothering us. The portions and presentation of the meals were great! The waffle was the best I've had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"Outstanding from start to finish--from reception to service and the meal itself. I've been to First Watch cafes in other cities and the Matthews store is every bit as good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Today was a busy day as a Sunday should be. Unfortunately they quoted 38 minutes for a table and it was 42 minute only because we kick and scream to get the six top that opened up available to us versus sending it to the top or poor top in that same feet they had created a false wait by having seven open tables 3 of those tables went undefeated for over 35 minutes they were worried about  \"crashing the kitchen \", If the restaurant is not capable of handling their restaurant at capacity they need to hire more kitchen staff. Nothing in. So a customer like seeing open tables going un-sat for 40 minutes. When I pulled the manager to explain the situation as to why the tables are going un-sat she got very irritated and did not want to apologize compromise or agree that all the table should be sat and no one should be standing waiting. Not manager quality. Very disappointed and this is my first watch on Val vista and baseline gets a one star today.   The server who waited on us was extremely kind and help to get our order in in a timely manner so that we could get to our events that we are going to be late for."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS MY ALL TIME FAVE BREAKFAST PLACE EVARRRRR. No for real though, I could literally order anything off the menu, I have never been like that anywhere else."}
{"text":"Used to go here when it was a good egg. Now this place is a bad egg. Horrible service, took forever to ask what we wanted after we were seated. When we were ready to leave had to go to the cashier to get take-home containers.  In terms of food. Plates were too small. Order Benedict and when i went to cut it up to eat, food fell off the plate. When I went to eat it the food was room temperature/cold.  Not worth your time or business."}
{"text":"This is a satisfactory breakfast/brunch/lunch option in downtown Phoenix.  Breakfast includes options such as omelets, pancakes, Belgian waffles and French toast.  Also something called crepegg (as you would expect, a crepe served with eggs).  There's a section on the menu called \"Healthier Side\", with stuff like a yogurt and granola parfait, smoked turkey patties and egg whites.  Lunch, as you would expect, includes burgers, BLTs and reubens.  I ordered a plate with scrambled eggs, a delicious thick slice of ham and little cubed has-brown potatoes.  The potatoes were bland and a little rubbery.  Service was pretty good.  Like the huge glasses of ice water and the fact that they leave the coffee pot at your table (coffee flavor was distinctive but not over-roasted).  The only off-note (pun somewhat intended) was the loud music blared into the dining room.  Not only was it too loud, it was of a \"genre\" that caters to an extremely small base.  And I can tell you that most of the patrons would not like the crap they were playing.  But other than that, First Watch is okay.  Not open for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me first say that other locations  are much better.  This one seems to lack in service and poor attention to detail.   Literally  3 tables seated after us were greated and placed orders.  When their food came out the waitress then came to take our order.  When food came potatoes were not cooked, sandwich had no sauce.  Try the other locations, just not this one."}
{"text":"Met some of my colleagues here for brunch on a Sunday and I didn't have to wait for seating to my surprise! It was my first time here. I was the first to arrive but they had no problem seating me while I  waited for the others. However, after we left I seen there was a wait outside. Our server was quite attentive to offer me something to drink while I waited. I ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict and it met all expectations! The avocado toast looked just as amazing! This is a great place for breakfast. Highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Our server Barbara was so sweet and on point. We did not wait for anything.  The kids meals are a nice size. They have a lot on the menu and the food is on point."}
{"text":"Decent spot for a traditional breakfast. Scrambled eggs were fluffy. Bacon was extra crispy (just the way I like it) The seasoned potatoes were on the dry side and not piping hot. The server told me the toast would be dry and it came out buttered with only enough jam for half a slice. Average service. It took over 5 minutes for a server to come by and say hello."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait about 15/20 minutes to get a seat on a weekend morning. This place is a popular breakfast spot. They have a lot of the standards, and many more healthy choices then a typical greasy spoon. The staff were all very nice, just very busy. Kid friendly with a kids menu and crayons. I did think the prices were a bit high. Not my first choice for a breakfast spot, but still a great one."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place while in NC. The service was great, food was outstanding, and ambiance was on point. Was surprised to see so many people on a Wednesday morning but no wait time and food was timely. I had the Traditional Breakfast with sausage links and multigrain bread.. food was superb. Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"You will hear me say time and time again that breakfast food is my favorite food. First Watch does not disappoint. This is extremely interesting to me considering they are a rebranding of The Good Egg, and I literally despised The Good Egg.   I've been to First Watch twice now and both experiences have been very good. The servers I've had there both times were really friendly and willing to offer suggestions when they were asked for.  My first experience, I went with my friend for brunch. I had the breakfast sandwich (the name escapes me) without the bacon and the potatoes. Yum! My friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, and he was pleasantly satisfied with them.   The second time was only a few days ago when I went with my guy and our roommate. I ordered he avocado toast (because I'm super basic and I love avocados more than anything). It's so good. The whole grain toast and the little spritz of lemon and salt on top of the avocado makes it. The juice is always fresh tasting and the atmosphere is pleasant and good for breakfast time. A good, chill way to wake up and ease into your day.   10/10 will return. Plus it's really close to home, sooooo that's a win!"}
{"text":"I think the Star rating that this establishment has speaks volumes.  This restaurant is open for breakfast and brunch. It closes by 2:30pm. The menu has a wide array of healthy food to choose from and not your ordinary breakfast food.  They specialize in their fresh fruit and vegetable drinks. My food was hot, tasty and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed breakfast at First Watch. It's a great addition to the breakfast options in the Biltmore area. We arrived at 11 AM on a Sunday morning, and the place was packed- we waited about 20 min for our table, but coffee and water are available while you wait.  We started with juices and enjoyed a green kale-based juice and another gingery one. Both were great! I had the veggie omelet, which was stuffed with mushrooms, kale, and goat cheese, and came with buttered whole wheat toast and a salad! It was so delicious: the veggies were cooked perfectly without being smushy like veggies in omelets sometimes are. My brother had the chickenchanga with potatoes, which he enjoyed. He said the potatoes were fantastic.  Our service was ok; it took a while to get food and coffee, and after our server brought our tab she never came back, so I wasn't able to get a to-go container for my leftovers.   The decor is bright and comfortable, and there are tables indoors as well as in a small patio area in the front. The vibe is low-key and family-friendly, which is nice because a lot of the breakfast places in this area are on the nicer, and pricier, side. Despite the busy-ness, the whole place was very clean! I would definitely come back to First Watch."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and I don't foresee us returning any time soon. I ordered the egg white omelet with turkey and all that was in the omelet was soggy onions. The omelet was flat and I believe they neglected to add in the turkey. The whole grain toast was nothing to rave about and it came with about 4 pieces of cut up fruit in a very small cup. For the price paid, I do not believe it was worth the value.   We are from Las Vegas where there are an abundance of good local breakfast places where you definitely get what you paid for. We are healthy eaters, but not bird eaters and the portions were small and the taste of the omelet was very bland.   It seems a hot spot for the Phoenix locals, but come to Vegas where you surely will not be disappointed! I will be more than happy to suggest some great breakfast eateries which have the same type of clean and healthy breakfasts, at a lower price but chockfull of flavor!"}
{"text":"Well I've been to First Watch countless times. But only a few times at this location. I wish I could give them a better review, but it was pretty sub par today. The wait was crazy long (Sunday brunch so I can forgive that), but we watched people get sat, order, eat and leave before we got our food. The Elevated Egg Sandwich was good, but the side of potatoes were pretty raw. My friend got the Farmhouse Hash and his potatoes were raw too, and that's a big part of that dish. My other friend ordered the same as me and had the same experience. The hubby ordered the Power Quinoa Bowl and he really liked it. This wasn't the first time the potatoes were undercooked, so I had to Yelp it today."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I order here more than any other restaurant! I also love that they allow us to order previous specials that are no longer on the daily menu! The quinoa bowl with sausage, kale and roasted tomatoes is delish!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Mom's recommendation brought me here and I wasn't impressed. Maybe it's really dependent on what you get. She really liked the French toast because it wasn't too sweet on her first visit.  This visit was with 3 of us. My wife's omelet seemed like it had been sitting - she used the word 'crusty.'  My pot roast hash was really fatty. A couple bites were just large chunks of fat. I guess it's hard to weed out, but for the mediocre amount of pot roast in it, it seemed like a rough ratio. Good flavor though, I enjoyed the good bites and veggies.  My moms waffle was nothing special, she regretted not getting the French toast again. The cherry compote with it was excellent, however. Her 'crisp' bacon came out gummy and she had to sent it back. Then it came back completely dried out. Just seemed like someone forgot about it.  Food took a long time to come out, so maybe the kitchen was under staffed?   All in all I wasn't pumped. At least the price wasn't too high. Also, they didn't charge for the bacon. She probably would have asked for a new plate if we didn't want to risk waiting a long while.   Also, this place is trying to be hip with the distressed tables and wood paneling... But there wasn't my sound absorption. Pretty loud for a breakfast spot.  Meh."}
{"text":"We are visiting from our of town.  The food is fresh and healthy.  Plenty of choices!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Ordered chicken salad with cheese melt sandwich.  Received one slice of bread chicken very very dry piled on bread, cheese over the top that was not melted. Glass of coke was $2.59 no refills.  Maybe the hot cakes or waffles are better.  Not sure that I will go back, to many other really good places to choose from."}
{"text":"Just arrived from Hawaii in the AM and was looking for a breakfast spot on the spot and First Watch pulled up on Yelp and had great reviews and was nearby the airport so we decided to try it out. Arrived right when they opened and had a lot of openings. We were seated right away and had the best server ever! His name was Junior(wears glasses) and he was just on point and on purpose with everything. Got build that friendship and trust as he served us. Gave us couple recommendations and took his word for it! Food was awesome! Tasty breakfast and also have us some samples of their fresh juice. Toast was good, eggs Benedict was good, and had a Farmers breakfast? I forgot the name but it had Farmers on it. Really awesome, breakfast spot with a nice modern yet rustic wood vibe. I highly recommend this place for breakfast! Go check it out and have Junior as your server! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Every time I have been, I have always had great dishes. I have been coming to this establishment, even when they called themselves the Good Egg. They re-did the inside and it's more accommodating to large crowds. Service is always pleasant, especially today! Loved our waitress today, she was a doll. My tip would be, come early, cause there is always a long wait."}
{"text":"I know it costs a little bit more but look around, they don't serve avocado at 9 am anywhere in 10 miles radius! It's a lovely, fresh, fast and tasty, and a bit unusual breakfast food that will satisfy you. One word for you: skillets. Sizzling crunchy fresh. Service here is fast and very blunt, your waitress is not going to tell you her autobiography and won't ask you about your accent (haircut, mood, criminal record) either, which is just the way I like it. If I come for food, give me food, chatting me up is not gonna feed me, sister. So I am incredibly grateful for the lack of interest in me from the other side of the table. I am wiling to pay extra for that any day.  And of course it is all about turnover, so just grab your skillet and get going.  I totally understand and love this place, and I think  that it loves me back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, tried the Million Dollar Bacon as suggested in other reviews and yup--it's worth it! Coffee was strong and they left us a carafe, prices were more than reasonable for the amount and quality of the food! Outdoor seating is first come first serve, also you can call ahead or put your name on the waitlist through Yelp. We had breakfast here and will definitely be coming back for more on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Soooooo soooo good. We've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and every food option I've tried so far has been amazing, especially given pricing. Service can be a hit or a miss, just in terms of sheer personality of servers, but they're pretty consistent about timely delivery. The server today was super friendly and personable, joking with my kiddo, and upped the experience just by being friendly. No one has ever been rude by any stretch, just kinda mechanic before today. But, I love the food, the cost, the efficiency and the location, and I'm not that \"man\" that thinks a smile is a requirement hence the 5 stars. I do appreciate the engagement though, and again, today the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I found this breakfast joint near our house at Arrowhead Ranch and since I walked in the first time over a year ago, I have never had a bad meal, bad service or anything bad. The food is unbelievably fresh and well plated. The prices are very fair for the quality of the meals served here. I would recommend this restaurant to every one I know. I recommend trying the Kale Tonic. Very refreshing indeed!!!"}
{"text":"I wish we had more places like this in Seattle! It's a great little breakfast/lunch/coffee place. Everything seemed pretty healthy & fresh, which is always good. I came here while in Ohio visiting family, and because we were on vacation we were able to come on a weekday mid-morning, which I think helped in terms of getting a seat rather quickly.  I ate the Greek fetish omelet, minus peppers and onions (so, spinach and feta and black olives), made with egg whites. Everything tasted great including the side of potatoes and an English muffin. They had a few seasonal specials that sounded great as well as some juices, but I was happy with my choice.  The part that I was most impressed by was one of the servers. She recognized my grandma (whether from coming here or because the server used to work somewhere else my grandma frequented, I wasn't sure) and took the time to come over and say hi and compliment her on always looking good (or something like that). Then I heard her having a conversation with the table behind us as well and it seemed like she was being very friendly and personable with them, too."}
{"text":"1st time to try First watch.  I ordered eggs Benedict Florentine.  I asked if possible to scramble my eggs.  I expressed to my server how I DONT like runny eggs not fully cooked.  I expressed to the server I like the eggs fully whipped together before cooking.  When it came out I saw the eggs were cooked on the stovetop long enough to chop them up and be able to put them on the bread & tomato.  They were covered with hollandaise sauce and when I pointed out to the server the eggs were still runny, he said it was just the hollandaise sauce.  You could CLEARLY see wet yellow yolk on the plate.  He asked if I wanted to send it back and I said no.  I have developed a healthy fear of what a server or cook may do to the food if the customer doesn't like it.  I pushed the runny eggs off to the side and ate the bread, tomato and 3 pieces of avocado.  We needed a coffee carafe refill and our server had disappeared.  I asked a different worker if he would please bring us a refill.  He gladly did."}
{"text":"First Watch fue un gran hallazgo! Mi familia es grande así que siempre batallamos para mesas, la espera y todo eso. Está vez éramos un grupo de 17 personas y una perrita así que reservamos todo el patio, digo mencionamos porque hablamos como media hora antes para que ya fueran estando listos para la hora de llegada.  Ya una vez llegado ahí todos esperamos como 5 min. La comida la sirvieron súper rápido! Ni esperamos casi nada y estaba súper rica! El café wow! Un sabor exquisito y estaba recién hecho y calientito y eso me fascinó!  El servicio fue muy atento y debo de reconocer que éramos muchos y un poco demandantes pero nos atendieron excelente ! La verdad se ha convertido en uno de mis lugares favoritos y pienso regresar cuando vuelva a andar por estos rumbos lo recomiendo totalmente y si tienes perritos tendrás que estar en el patio y a tu mascota la sentaras afuera del patio. Ese fue el único inconveniente de ahí en fuera todo estuvo muy bien !"}
{"text":"Had the pancakes, Carrot cake and  Bacon Cheddar and both tasted great!"}
{"text":"The First Watch is one of our favorite restaurants! My husband and I usually eat there about once a week. The staff is always welcoming and attentive, they know us by name, and typically have our usual drinks to us shortly after we are seated. This past weekend our server Carlos talked me into trying the new hibiscus limeade instead of drinking my usual kale tonic and I was glad I did! I recommend trying their new Salmon Benedict or anything on their summer menu- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in the door, the staff was attentive and made sure that each request was quickly taken care of. We got our food very quickly and everything tasted amazing. I had the Bacado, one of their house omelettes, and it was definitely a good choice. I liked that each omelette came with toast and a small side of mixed greens. Most of the menu items were reasonably priced and it's a great spot for breakfast or brunch, also the atmosphere feels very hip and trendy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. Love their omelettes and pancakes and pretty much everything. Feels somewhat healthier than other breakfast places too. Try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"High quality, fresh ingredients prepared with a slant to the healthy side. Very prompt and friendly service...we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this breakfast place until my dad took me this morning.  This place is great!  My dad and his wife said it was the best breakfast place in town, and I'm inclined to agree, even though I've only been to a couple of breakfast places.  I had the fruit crepes, which came with granola and their muffin of the day, while my little sister had an omelette and my girlfriend had some dish with sausage and egg.  I tried everything and it was all great, and super cheap to boot.  I think each of our dishes were like $7."}
{"text":"Amazing, healthy, affordable food. We had the quinoa power bowls and it was incredible. We are so glad we discovered this place!!"}
{"text":"Amber is great! She is the perfect example of great customer service! She always makes it fun and about us!Today we switched it up and I got the Huevos rancheros and it was YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I have wonderful memories of First Watch in St. Louis, back in my uni days. When I moved out to greater Phoenix area, I was so excited to get a First Watch coupon in the mail!!! When I finally got around to checking it out, it just brought back all the fond memories I have of great brunches, coffee, and succinct/appetizing seasonal menus while catching up with friends.  Food here did not let me down. It was aesthetically pleasing which only added to the delicious taste! My family and I pretty much got...2/3 of the seasonal menu -Drinks: Started with (unlimited!) coffee, the kale tonic (super tangy and yum if you don't like your drinks sweet), and the morning meditation (this was BEAUTIFUL, but a little sweet for my taste. I think I like a good tang) -Brunch brunch brunch: My mom got the Pot Roast Hash was a hit! - It's definitely on the heavier side if you like light breakfasts. I got the AM Superfood Bowl to balance out the pot roast hash, which was a brilliant idea. The coconut chia seed pudding below wasn't too sweet or thick, and the fruit/granola was a great addition. In addition to the multigrain bread & salted PB, delicious! I'd get this again. My dad got the Elevated Egg Sandwich, and while I thought it was kind of generic sounding, something about this was SO delicious! Definitely recommend! We all left with happy bellies for our hike!  The only thing keeping me from the 5 stars...wait times. I was lucky to have timed the NoWait via Yelp (STL is a huge fan of the NoWait app so I'm thrilled to see it here!) that we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. HOWEVER, our food took an additional 35 min to be served!!! So come around with some chatty friends because you'll be waiting a while. Other than that, service was so accommodating and friendly. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed breakfast with my husband this morning and will definitely be back! We loved the location and the early opening (6:30am) on a Sunday. The cozy patio was perfect for outside dining especially since the dining room was a bit too cold first thing in the morning.  I had the Yogurt, fruit and granola bowl and it was great. The granola was made in-house and was delicious, however the muffin served room temp was forgettable. My husband had the Frittata had he enjoyed it but did say it was a bit overcooked. The portions are generous and the service is outstanding. Our server was Lauren B and she was perfect! My husband already passed on the good review to his dad."}
{"text":"Our meal today was ok. I must say I first thought would not return, but while paying I was asked how was the food. I was honest stating it was ok. Then the cashier asked what we had and if any of it was good. Then he insisted on comping our entire meal. I'll come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Great food! So healthy they have choices of all sausage which I love! I had the breakfast tacos and banana granola pancakes  so amazing! I would definitely return to try more on the menu! Wanted to try everything!! My boyfriend got a morning juice and he loved it! Felt so cleansed. Staff was nice and gave you your space!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!!!! The Cobb salad was the perfect portion and ration of chicken and blue cheese. My kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes! The service was . Great place for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Even when watching your carbs there is so much to choose from. We have never had a bad experience here. We have eaten at 4 different locations and all of them have been great! I also love the decor. Highly recommend for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere and the food was okay. Just okay. Seems they have a little problem handling a larger group. Didn't come back and check on us, no refill on the coffee or water. Warning. Even though coffee and water are already on the table when you arrive, the coffee is an extra cost."}
{"text":"I visit the place weekly and just love the menu and staff. They are friendly, accommodating and feel like family. The menu has so many choices, many healthy ootions too, it is hard to select! Im pretty sure the patio is pet friendly though I have not participated. Ample parking in an active area. All in all a reasonably priced option for any breakfast situation."}
{"text":"I am totally in love with their fresh brewed mango iced tea, it is really good. Their food is more on the healthy side and offers some choices that are not on most breakfast/lunch spots.   I have tried their eggs benedict with turkey & avocado and it was wonderful. The turkey here tastes fresh roasted and is sliced super thin. Also had their waffle...wow!! its light, fluffy, and not too sweet. Comes with hot syrup and a fruit compote.  Service here is excellent all around, even when they are super busy. I will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant whenever we are in town. It has options for the both of us, which is very hard to find considering I am picky about health and he prefers as many calories and as much fat as possible. The staff is very friendly and the food is made quickly. We have never had a problem with how the food was made; it is always consistent. It is all very affordable, as well. If we lived in town, we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, great breakfast options and fresh juice. You can tell they care about the meals they make. Whenever I'm in town I make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Loved it! My wife and I came in after our twins pediatrician appointment. We both tried one of their fresh fruits- she tried one with kale while I tried the melon one. Both were awesome but I think the one with kale was the best. I had the parma skillet hash which was just what I was looking for while my wife had the market vegetable omelet. We were both impressed with the food quality and order time. We will definitely make our next appointment in the morning so we can come back after!"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. Clean and great customer service. Only down fall is they don't fry any food like hash browns otherwise, a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I took my 3 daughters here this morning for breakfast. They were fairly busy, but not crazy busy. We were seated right away. However it took 10 minutes for our server to greet us. We ordered right away. He brought our drink almost 10 minutes later!! However my daughter ordered water to drink and he never brought the water. Then I noticed that people who were seated 10 minutes AFTER us were getting their food!! They had a different server so that may have been the reason...It took our food 20 minutes, and it wasn't anything special. An omelette with avocado and bacon, a chocolate chip pancake, a bowl of fruit and eggs and bacon. When our food finally arrived it was bland. He also FORGOT our bread sides. After I saw him bring food to a lady that got seated 25 minutes after us, and she got her food 10 minutes after ordering, I said we never got our bread. Plus, I had asked for a side of dressing that he never brought. It was terrible. He was so disjointed and non-attentive, I did not leave a tip. It takes a lot for me to do that by the way! I always at least leave 15%, usually 25%. However there was no way with all the waiting and forgetting and just plain awful service that I would ever leave a tip! We will never be back here and I will let all of my kids friends families know not to come here. I could make better food at home and I would definitely get better service from my 11 year old!!  I miss The Good Egg!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love their egg Benedict with salmon. I am from Chicago, IL and every time I travel to Scottsdale, AZ I make a point to dine here. Also, awesome friendly service and clean kitchen make it a true gem for me."}
{"text":"Have been to many First Watch restaurants across USA and this Scottsdale location is missing the mark. Upon arrival very little greeting and the absence of a smile was noticeable. We sat for about 7 minutes with out an offer of water or coffee. In bathroom they were out of towels. Our server was non communicative. A robot could have done better. The food was ok"}
{"text":"Love first watch! Each time I'm in Phoenix (which is often), I check to see if I'm near one so I may have breakfast or minimally grab a fresh squeezed juice.  The facilities are clean and welcoming.  The staff is friendly. It is family friendly. My two year old son loves it!! He also has a great palette. Loves his veggies, waffles with maple syrup.  I would like to see green waffles and other non/low carb gluten/vegan free items. That's a request I have most places now that I've had them in the Bay."}
{"text":"We have been twice within the first weeks of opening. We went on weekday mornings so there was no wait. The service was fantastic and our food was delicious. Love the healthy options (the veg omelette was great with roasted veggies, fresh herbs and goat cheese; the bread/toast was phenomenal; great fried potatoes; eggs benedict florentine on ciabatta, avocado toast, all great)! Love the pot of fresh coffee left on the table so you don't have to wait for a refill! It's nice to finally have a quality option in the Matthews area. My new favorite spot and the only breakfast restaurant I will now go to locally!"}
{"text":"I'm adding this to my original post below and have changed my rating from two stars to four.  The management team of First Watch has been so responsive to our very bad dining experience!  I even received a call from a district manager from KS thanking me for giving them the heads up about experience.  Very impressed!!!  Took way too long to get drinks.  Server never even introduced himself.  Came to the table and said, \"What can I get you to drink?\"  We are still waiting for our breakfast as I'm typing this review.  Restaurants that don't have high expectations of their team, will not be in business very long."}
{"text":"To start, I have never been here before and I strictly came in because of their marketing free entree promotion. My girlfriend has been to a different location before and said it was good so we decided to give brunch a go.  Showing up we were immediately placed on the list which they said would take about 10 minutes and we would be texted when it was ready. This feature alone is very nice - showing they actually have a real system rather than yelling someone's name into a crowd.   When we were seated 5 minutes later we immediately talked about how nice the restaurant looked and the money they must have put into it. The ambience was casual with every table filled. Right away we were given our own pitcher of water, which naturally eases the load on a busy waiter or waitress and I definitely prefer it as I drink a ton of water.   The only comment I will have to address previous reviews is while our order was taken minutes after we sat down it did take a bit long, maybe 20 minutes or so, to receive our meals as well as more water. I'm chalking it up as our waitress took a quick break because we didn't see her for that time.   Otherwise, this place was refreshing and satisfying for brunch and I highly recommend it. Pricing was standard and fair in my opinion. The quality of the food was up there filling. I ordered the Tri-fecta which came with a waffle, choice of meat, and two eggs. The jam alone made the meal for me - absolutely delicious.   Try it out if you haven't already and utilize the option to add yourself to the waitlist on your way over if there is a line. Don't miss out on the bacon!!! Perfection.   Side note: the brown sugar dispenser is great. ;)"}
{"text":"Previously visited The Good Egg many times. This week it switched to First Watch. I had the veggie burger which was excellent. I love all the healthy options, great service, and cool decor. I'll be back again in a couple days!"}
{"text":"Yum! Tried First Watch for breakfast this morning for the first time. I love the decor, we used to go to breakfast at the place here before (which was always tasty) but I have to saw the facelift is really awesome. We got there around 9:30 on Saturday and we were able to be seated right away. Drinks came out quickly and our food did as well. So many options to choose from, with seasonal specials that all looked amazing! My daughter loved her chocolate chip pancake, I had biscuits and gravy which was amazing, and my husband had the egg sandwich which had tons of avocado on it and was really good too! I would totally get the same thing next time, except I want to try everything on their menu (which has tons of options!). If you haven't been here yet, definitely give it a try. Also, prices were really good for the ingredients they use and portion sizes. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"this place reminds me of a more refined dennys.   run of the mill breakfast spot. you wouldn't be missing out on much if you never ate here, and i only came here because the place i really wanted to get breakfast at had an hour wait.   i couldn't find any breakfast item that looked particularly appetizing, so i went with the buffalo chicken wrap. my gf ordered the choco chip pancake, and a side of scrambled eggs and ham. food came out, nothing special, taste and looks wise. my buffalo chicken wrap was overloaded with lettuce and lacked a suitable amount of chicken. the buffalo sauce was different than any i've ever had and wasn't very spicy. the bleu cheese crumbles were good though. i ordered a side of bleu cheese dressing and it came out looking like mayo. i don't know if i can ever eat bleu cheese after that. my gfs pancake was a ok nothing really stood out.  our sever was awesome though. everyone inside was very friendly. i appreciate good service."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for brunch and there was a 25 minute wait.  Recommend using NoWait - didn't realize they use that app or would've added our name to the line beforehand.  But the wait wasn't terrible - it may have been less than 25 minutes since tables were turning pretty quickly.  Ordered the Harvest Egg in a Hole and the menu description made it sound more fancier, trendier and yuppier than it actually appeared in reality.  I was expecting a rustic, thick-cut sour-dough bread with wilted kale sauteed with cremini mushrooms (aka fancy-schmancy mushrooms) and got what appeared to be white bread (I'm sure it was sour-dough but didn't really taste much of anything except the egg and sauce), with raw kale leaves that had some white mushrooms sauteed to a mush and probably three bacon bit crumbs.    The egg was runnier than I usually like but all in all it was an average meal.  The highlight of the meal was probably the juice.  I drank the Day Glow which has a gingery taste so if you don't like ginger don't get it.  And my husband had the Kale tonic.  I really liked both but drank more of the Day Glow since my husband doesn't like ginger.    I'd probably go back to try something else but not when it's so crowded on the weekend.  Overall, I thought they make the place seem trendier and tastier than it actually is.  Great job marketing!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really great hash! I appreciate that this brunch place gives you a seasonal menu outside of their regular fare.   The benches in the place are a little shallow, and I'm a big guy, so there was slight discomfort; however, the quality of service and food quickly made me forget any tweaks I would make to the seating situation.   The portions are great, and even an arugula salad was elevated and tasty. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First watch has great food but not as great service. There is only one person that runs the check in and check out counter. She also seats people and helps get tables set up. There is constantly a wait because there are empty tables sitting dirty. Ridiculous. If they would hire more employees this would not be an issue. There should be more people to clean the tables and another individual to help with check out/call in orders. Come on first watch- get it together."}
{"text":"Terrible service  Very long wait for food  Even long line to check out  This will be our last visit  Saw one table of six get there breakfast about 5 minutes between plates then  There is a huge area in middle with chairs and couches  I guess they know they don't need more tables  Food was ok Not worth the money  -received a BOGO They took the child's plate off out of 3 breakfast"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for lunch around 1pm, and were surprised that we actually had a short wait for a table.  I got a half roast beef sandwich and half sweet honey pecan salad, while my mom ordered the BLTE (bacon, lettuce, tomato and egg).  The iced tea was delicious, and the poor waitress was able to keep up with my seemingly unquenchable thirst!  When the food came, man, were the portions generous!  My roast beef sandwich on sourdough was absolutely delicious, especially when I dabbed a little of the creamy horseradish sauce on it.  The half salad was huge and even came with grilled chicken on it, which I wasn't expecting.  The dressing was sweet, but not overbeating and I loved the combination of avocado with the salad.  My mom's BLTE also left her one happy diner and we both can't wait to come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, good food and very clean place. They even have gluten free and healthy options... love the salmon eggs benedict.  Cons are that it can be very busy and a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was charming and clean. I had a taste of banana pancakes, they were delicious. I ordered the eggs Benedict. Cudos to our server for noticing the poached eggs were over cooked. He brought back another plate but those eggs were far too undercooked. I like the yoke runny but the whites were runny and that is just not acceptable. Poached eggs are basic so I'm surprised any breakfast restaurant wouldn't get these right. We were given very low quality napkins that were too thin for normal use. On a good note the water was clear cold and refreshing. They do need to improve on the coffee as it was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Belgian waffles are to die for.... We are always on a quest to find a 'great' breakfast place nearby and we enjoyed everything we ordered. I had the breakfast scramble which consisted of scrambled eggs, spinach, ooey gooey yummy cheese, ham, all on a crisp & buttery croissant.  Can't wait to try their lunch menu next!"}
{"text":"I like First Watch! Ever since they did their renovations the place is looking spiffy! It's new look makes it look hip and rejuvenated, before the place didn't really appeal to me, although the food was pretty good. Now after the facelift I'm more apt to returning to the place!"}
{"text":"Great healthy menu with good quality food and great customer service! Love the urban farm decor! My new favourite go-to breakfast place. The pesto chicken quinoa bowl is so good!"}
{"text":"For what it is, I'd say this is almost as good as it gets! Really great menu, fresh ingredients, and a friendly staff.. we had a great breakfast here! We both ordered off the specials menu, I ordered the Heirloom Tomatoes & Buratta Cheese dish, which was amazing! It's served on a grain toast with 2 basted eggs on the side, and although it looks small the ingredients make it filling and very yummy! I also ordered the Morning Meditation juice, and while my husband want a fan (not his taste), I thought it was great! We said we'd have to go back before our vacation ended because there were so many things on the menu thar we wanted to try!"}
{"text":"Talk about fresh orange juice, this place has transitioned into a very nice breakfast joint. It is remodeled with a very rustic feel. The customer service was great and the food had wonderful presentation. Keep it up First Watch, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Mmm... breakfast. This is one of the only chain restaurants we went to on our trip to Arizona, but they don't have anything quite like this in Chicago, and I'll tell you that this was one of the places that made our trip worthwhile.  First Watch has great stuff for breakfast. It's somewhat Southwestern-inspired. There were many items on the menu like what I decided on, the Bacado. It was an omelet with bacon and avocado.  Yum. The potatoes it came with had a little bit of spice. Yum. The girl had sourdough french toast. Yum!  The service was good. The food was good. It was inexpensive. We got a good breakfast with coffee and juice and were out of there into downtown Phoenix for less than $30."}
{"text":"It was incredible. My pregnant girlfriend tasted the food and started having contractions. The baby didn't want the food second hand; baby wanted to taste it. Wanted that sweet sweet noms in its mouth. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We go one time per month after walking the bridle path on Central.  Always a good bet until today. Stone cold.  Yes, the eggs Florentine.  Not even the potatoes were warm.  Well the coffee was hot.  The waitress super.  Bet it was she who forgot to bring out the plates.  Who else?  It had to be hot at some point."}
{"text":"Unplanned stop here as we were traveling through the area. I follow a vegan diet and didn't bother checking out the menu beforehand as it appeared to be a healthy spot that would offer vegan options .. my mistake! I can't believe a popular breakfast/brunch spot does not have lactose-free milk alternatives?? Basically the only item I could order off the menu was the avocado toast. They're generous on the avocado, I'll give them that. Service was subpar. They put forth no effort to accommodate. Wait was quite long."}
{"text":"It was good but not particularly impressed. Got the breakfast scramble, definitely something I could have made myself at home. Biggest complaint is their potatoes! Oh my goodness you might as well order a side of fried onions. I was pulling out huge chunks of onion and the intense flavor of onion was impossible to make with ketchup or hot sauce. And apparently they are completely unable to make a side of potatoes without onions because they're pre mixed together. They were atrocious."}
{"text":"Had to wait 12 min after being seated to have anyone see us. The restaurant staff were not even in a rush at this time.  We are very patient people, but that long to even take a drink order is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I wish First Watch would proliferate all over this great land like Starbucks, Dennys, Waffle House and IHOP. Soooooo delicious.  Freshly made everything, some organic, some veggie, free range eggs,  First Watch is breakfast nirvana.    I sauntered here one morning just to see the deal.  I sat down.  My respectful and friendly waitperson looked at me and figured out the deal, yeah, \"He wants breakfast, coffee, a nicely made juice drink and off he'll go to work,\"  And that I did.    The Nicely Made Juice Drink:  I asked what her favorite drink was and she said a combo of  just-pressed kale, carrots and ginger drink.  She figured out I wanted that, so I got it. Deeeeeelish..... my veggies for the morning zapped with a ginger jolt.  The Breakfast:  I asked her what the deal is with the smoked salmon Benedict and she said it's one of the popular dishes here.  She figured out I wanted something not so meaty but substantial.  I relished the freshness of this plate and when I cut into the egg and it sauced the rest of my plate, I reached nirvana.  Lovely breakfast, simple, fresh, high protein. Finito.   The Coffee:  Was better than standard served with half n half,   fake creamers for the hazelnut flavor lovers, and  simple syrup, take your pick.  She figured out that I wanted a togo cup.  Nice.  Happy and content, off  to work he went,  with a bit of a gait,  she predicted.    I was happy all morning. Really.   Service:   Telepathic   Visits:  2  Tip:  Super popular...... OK packed after 9am, lines and waits.   Open till about 3pm.  If you're staying at the Courtyard Marriott Phoenix North, First Watch is litrelly next door."}
{"text":"They have really good food, but their service is extremely slow. Definitely not a place that you could go during lunch break. The last two times I went, I had to wait 30-40 minutes for a couple of scrambled eggs and toast. They took care of our check since we were waiting for so long, which was really nice of them, but I still probably won't go back because of the slow service."}
{"text":"We had Easter Breakfast at the First Watch on Val Vista in Mesa.  Our server was Jennifer and she was awesome.  So friendly and engaged with us in our conversation.  Extremely attentive to our table,  I would highly recommend First Watch in Mesa and try to get a table in Jennifer's area you will not be disappointed.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"First and last time will go in for food. First server was by any means pleasant or friendly. Hate going to a place that puts coffee pot on table and water pitcher it's like they don't want to be bothered with you. Food came out cold like was in window for awhile so much so could not even consider a reorder or something else. I see others have had better experiences but I for one will stick with my usual breakfast place and not try them again. This was first ever when had an issue manager did not come to table hate to think it was because we were gay."}
{"text":"LOVE this breakfast/lunch place. I have been coming here for years. Before it was First Watch it was The Good Egg and the transformation has been incredible to watch. Amazing food, amazing service. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I tried the pumpkin pancakes (seasonal), chicken apple sausage, and eggs breakfast. All of it tasted freak'n amazing. The pumpkin pancakes were so moist. It just melted in your mouth plus with maple syrup too. It was the \"bomb!\" The chicken apple sausage was also good. It had no gristles in it like some sausages can. Place was clean and very friendly service. Please visit if you're ever in Phoenix. This place is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Moved here from Sarasota and am so glad it's out here .)   Tres COOL"}
{"text":"The service was nice. However they don't know how to poach an egg properly and I'm less than impressed with their hollandaise sauce.  These are some of the most basic brunch items. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I looooooove this place! Their chickachanga is to die for! The water tastes a bit off sometimes, but they make up for it with their menu items! Always coming back"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here Sunday morning.  What unique place.  Coffee while you wait - which wasn't really that long.  I had the chickenchanga while my wife had the Greek omelet - she liked hers, but nothing special, mine on the other hand was outstanding  -  we shared a bacon and cheddar pancake which was so good you didn't need syrup.  Too bad they aren't located in Michigan yet!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time not long ago. I can say that I'm now a fan! I can only compare this place to other chained breakfast spots unfortunately. I can say that this place seems like a healthier version of most breakfast places though. They have alot of choices from their menu. They have skillets and other items that are 'protein style' kinda. Everything seems very authentic and well prepared when I got my food. It wasn't just slapped on a plate and served to me. They actually take the time to have everything nice looking. Our server was fantastic and super nice. The overall vibe from this place was cozy and quiet. I'll be back.  Food quality: 5/5 Food price: 4/5 Customer service: 5/5 Restaurant cleanliness: 5/5"}
{"text":"Dirty....hostess pushed down garbage in can with hands...then gives you utensils. Probably not trained in food safety."}
{"text":"First Watch is the perfect place to grab a healthy breakfast and if you want to splurge they too have some amazing options for you. I love this place to have monday work meetings. Their coffee is great and its never too crowded like The good egg is."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and prompt, coffee was hot and the flavored creamers are a plus. This was our second \"First Watch\" visit on this vacation and I couldn't resist ordering the same breakfast sandwich with avocado. So delicious! Kids enjoyed their pancakes and Mr. G enjoyed his breakfast...whatever that was. The menu is fabulous with plenty of healthy options like smoothies and green drinks and even avocado toast! We left full and happy."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for breakfast whenever we are near downtown. I tend to gravitate toward my favorite dishes like the breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, bacon and yummy avocado. But this time around I chose a Chia bowl with berries and granola.  Wow! What a treat. I came back home and bought a bag of chia seeds and coconut milk so I can make my own breakfast pudding. Coffee was hot and fresh and the Strawberry Cooler was a winner.   My only complaint is that hostess stand is far from the entrance which doesn't make any sense.  We walked in and stood next to the register...which in most places...uh that's where the hostess stand is next to."}
{"text":"We typically eat breakfast on the weekends at Butters, U.S. Egg, or the Breakfast Joint. Decided to try this place out since it was new. Let me save y'all a trip....The service here is abysmal, and the food is mediocre at best. It wasn't busy/ packed - there were 6 tables total inside and 2-3 out on the patio and it wasn't packed when we left. Waitress barely came by. Never came to take our check, no one came to refill drinks, and no one came to see how the food was or whether we needed anything else.   Belgian Waffle was soggy. Our drinks sat empty as the waitress never came back after taking our order. I had to flag down another staff member to get some syrup for my already soggy waffle. Also had to ask for our juice that we initially ordered since it never came with our other beverages or our food."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. Wait time on a Sunday morning was about 30 minutes. Lots of seating for people waiting which was nice. Food was fresh and delicious. Toast was thick grain bread with fresh strawberry preserves. Side of fruit was a nice touch. Ordered the Parma Hash and loved it.  Can't wait to go back and bring friends. I was surprised by the other reviews as we had a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Had the smoked salmon Benedict which was amazing, but served with a weird side salad at breakfast which was just dry sad looking greens.  Kale cooler was fantastic.  The had Gluten free options which is a plus for me.  Atmosphere was trendy and cute.  Waitress was super busy and only had time to check on us very periodically. Ticket time was about 40 min on a Sunday at 11 AM. Overall, glad I tried it out, but maybe they should staff a little stronger on Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Overpriced food and tasteless. Soup tasted like canned soup. The potatoes were advertised as seasoned but tasted like dry, unseasoned, boiled potatoes. The Chicachonga had nothing inside and was dry and hard. The turkey club was 2 slices of hard stale sour dough bread and the ingredients were scarce. Could not find the avocado it was sliced so thin. Most club sandwiches are 3 slices and cut in wedges. The atmosphere of the place is no different than when it was the Egg place before it. Seats are wooden slats and hard on the back. The table has small glasses and cups on them when you arrive. Glasses were water spotted and mine had lipstick stain on it. I am pretty sure the water was tap water that they bring in a water spotted old type bottle without ice. The waiter put 2 ice cubes in each small glass which melted immediatedly. They promised fresh fruit on the side which consisted of 3 sour grapes, 1 blackberry and a wedge of very sour pineapple.Silverware was also water spotted and very uninviting. Most of the people were there with a 2 for 1 coupon. The service was slow. I would be very surprised if this place stays for more than a few months. Not worth it.  We won't be going back. Not even worth using a 2 for 1 coupon. I think they are trying to stay in business by sending out these coupons, but people want good quality, fresh food and clean utensils and glasses with pure water.  Bye bye!"}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh! Healthy turkey"}
{"text":"The whole gang came here for hangover cure. The food is so fresh it makes you feel clean after a dirty night out.  I got the Florentine eggs Benedict, which had fresh baby spinach, avocado and tomatoes. which was light but fulling. Felt practically back to 100% after this meal!   FYI there's no alcohol here if you're going for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is really cute but always packed when I come here the food is really good and so is the service and it always smells so good in here it's definitely a must try glad to see it in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This place is like an upgraded PaneraBread, super yummy. Just had the summer elote corn hash bowl and it left me feeling healthily full. They should expand and come to Seattle. Will definitely eat here again next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast stop, especially if you are fussy about quality of ingredients. We shared the breakfast tacos (you get 3), a side of fruit and two kale drinks. Everything was fantastic as well as their coffee. Huge servings sized to share. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We love First Watch and have been to many of them. We were excited about this one with the nice covered porch, but we were told they would not allow dogs on their outdoor porch. Our dog was to be leashed to the fence on the outside. For that, we will be going to any other First Watch from now on (all of which have allowed dogs on their porch)."}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I first discovered First Watch in Cleveland and were so happy when we discovered one so close to where we live. Haven't had a bad item on their menu yet, but our go-to is the power bowl. So happy it's on the menu now. Patio is pet friendly too."}
{"text":"We loved this place and were surprised it wasn't rated higher. They have an extensive menu with a range of healthy options and we enjoyed our meals. Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and the selection was GREAT!! They had your normal breakfast food, a good lunch selection and seasonal offerings!! The pumpkin spice pancakes were perfect and not over sweet! Applewood chicken smoked sausage and poached eggs paired perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"the hubby & i frequent this establishment quite often.... almost weekly... we love the friendly staff and the quick food delivery not to mention the yummy factor of the dishes.   so many options but we are breakfast people, even at 1:30pm. the chickichanga is a MUST if you like a little kick with your meal. my personal faves are the crepeggs. each one is a perfect combo of omelet to crepe!   oh! did i mention a free meal for your birthday if you sign up for their email club?? do it."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was a bit different than a typical breakfast place and has that \"hipster/hippie joint\" feeling. Their waffles are amazing and the staff was super friendly. I am from the South visiting family, and the staff was very Southern in their hospitality while we were  there. Always striking up conversations with us, around for refills and questions, and I tell you this is what I loved about it. It will be a return place for me the next time I am out there."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best places to eat breakfast. If you are a meat and potato kind of person though I would suggest a different place. This chain is more of a hipster place with only organic/healthy food that is on the pricey side. I love that kind of food, so I can't get enough of the place. Not for everyone but again, the food is amazing regardless!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous menu, very unique with many many healthy choices.  Really enjoyed the service, staff and food was excellent"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. It was fresh, healthy and fulfilling. The waitress was kind and the service was fast. The Meditation Juice drink was delish. I had the egg white omelette with feta, spinach, tomatoes and turkey. I loved it!!"}
{"text":"EDIT:  I went back to try again, with my three year old son.  They greeted us and let us know it was a 10 minute wait. Which is fine so we wait and then get seated and served.  The food was great, but it did take awhile to give my order and then receive it.  Overall, it was a nice lunch and I would consider coming back again, but I do think the service still has a few kinks to work out.   I went in by myself on Sunday for a lunch.  It was my first time and I see they are busy so I know it might take some time.  They say me down and said my server will be with me shortly.  The table was dirty, like they didn't bother wiping it down before seating me.  Which is kinda gross, but nothing I can't ask the server to fix one they show up.  Except they never showed up.  I sat for 10 minutes and no one came to get my drink or order or anything.  Which I understand they are busy, but it wasn't overly crowded and tables were open, servers just weren't serving.  I saw several just kind of walking around and stopping to talk to each other.  Which once again, I don't begrudge employee banter and fun, but I sat for way too long before I finally just walked out.  So I have no idea how the food is and I was excited to try a new place.  Maybe I'll try again.  But this has left a sour note in my mouth."}
{"text":"Good service good food nothing to complain I always enjoy coming here with family and friends"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and coffee. Service is consistent and great! Staff is friendly and welcoming. Thank you Alan for always providing great service."}
{"text":"There are two things that sets this place apart from other breakfast places. 1) Their pancake selection and 2) Their healthy choice options.  The pancakes are made from scratch and they offer about 10 different kinds, from traditional, to blueberry, to bacon and cheddar. Yes, you heard me right... A pancake with bacon and cheddar cheese mixed in. I was brave and tried that unique item, and wow!! It blew my taste buds away. I tried it with just butter, then with a little syrup. The flavor with the butter alone was outstanding!! These are pretty big but not as big as the restaurant hypes them up to be.  Their healthy choice options are great too. Even though I ate the cheddar bacon pancake, I did order the egg whites and turkey sausage. The serving sizes are my only complaint about this place. Many restaurants say something is 2, or 3 eggs and it comes out huge. This place looked like 2 egg whites. The turkey sausage was wonderful!"}
{"text":"What a find! Good coffee, excellent ingredients, many options, generous portions, friendly service--what's not to like?!  My triathlete's breakfast--egg white frittata with veggies, multigrain toast, pico de gallo, and fresh fruit--is the closest thing to a triathlon as I'll ever get, but it was fantastic, filling, super healthy & delicious. A lemon poppy muffin to go will be my snack later on."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have breakfast, brunch or dinner.  Food is very refreshing and light whether you have breakfast or lunch. Prices are reasonable. We will be back when in town."}
{"text":"On Thursday, September 28th at about 10 o'clock in the morning, my wife and I walked into the First Watch location at ValVista and Williamsfield in Gilbert. They said there would be about a 5 minute wait to be seated. Once we were seated we sat there for a good 25 to 30 minutes with no one walking over to our table to talk to us or even say anything like \"we will be right with you\". At least something, anything!! We kept watching waitresses walk right by us and help other the tables around us. No one brought us water or even acknowledged that we were there, we simply sat at the table talking to each other wondering why this was going on, watching everyone walk past us. I would say right about the 30 minute mark, we decided to leave because no one ever acknowledged that we were there. As we are walking out my wife told the lady at the front register \"we are leaving because no one ever came over to help us\" The only thing the lady at the register said was \"oh\". It was was like she actually said \"big deal\" or \"so what\". Very poor customer service!!  If that wasn't enough. As we were driving away we decided to call and speak to a manager. After we asked for a manager we sat on hold for another 15 minutes. After the manager finally gets on the phone. The manager said the lady who's table it was didn't know it was her table. Then how does that explain that the tables right next to us were being served and not us?! Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait! We came on what was probably the busiest day of the year...Mother's Day! We had to wait a while, but the staff remained friendly & worked hard to get a table for us as quickly as possible. Our server was crazy busy, but still remained sweet & helpful. The food was absolutely amazing, full of flavor & good portions.  I would definitely list this as one of my new favorite breakfast spots! Yummy"}
{"text":"The food is really good! Unfortunately the wait times, staff and pricing don't outweigh the positive.  We arrived today and were told a 15 meeting wait. 35 minutes later we were seated. On the way to our seats, we spotted 3 couples that came in after us.   We ordered immediately and continued to wait for the food. Two of the orders were wrong and the server only checked on as after I stared him down. $45 later and 1:30 spent....we won't go back!   Update: I was contacted by First Watch and asked to try again. We used the app this time and had a great experience with little wait. Use the app if going on the weekend. Bottom line, they reached out via phone and do care about their customers. Thank you First Watch!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious- I got the BLT eggs Benedict and it was really good, eggs were poached just right and definitely a large portion. This place has an extensive menu, it was hard to decide what to order. Overall service was prompt, price is reasonable and I'll definitely have to come back aga"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast foods!   Love their lemon ricotta pancakes, the eggs Benedict with bacon and avocado and the carafe of hot coffee on the table is so appreciated. They use really good breads: ciabatta, brioche, etc.  Very busy on weekends; even with the no-wait app, we waited a half hour. But that's because it is so good and the prices are reasonable.  Good service every single time. I've been 4X since the Bridgeville restaurant opened. Everyone was satisfied all 4 times."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat if flies weren't bad inside and outside.  I don't know what they should do but hate trying to eat and swat flies."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning and the food and service was excellent was very good.  Clean and refreshing very relaxing."}
{"text":"We went here for family Sunday Brunch with the parents. The parking lot was full and we thought we were going to have to wait to be seated. So we sent Dad to forge ahead as we parked the car. We cruised on in, and low and behold my Dad was at a table directing us to our table. I was shocked that we got seated right away, but the restaurant is big inside. So if the parking lot looks crowded, still check it out, you might be surprised. So we got all settled in and browsed the menu. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted. It was great! As a semi-vegetarian, there were tons of choices. There was also a healthy food section that I was drawn to.  My mom and I both decided to order the same thing- the tri athlete omelet. My dad got the Acapulca express omelet and husband got the bacado. We were all set to order but waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table, even to get our drinks. That was a little irritating, but it was busy so we went with it. Finally the waitress arrived and we ordered. She apologized for the wait.  We waited a little longer than normal for food to arrive but when we did, we were happy. The food was really good. I loved my healthy omelet. I thought I would miss the cheese, but when I covered it in salsa I was like \"cheese who?\" I devoured it and it was delicious. I even put it on the english muffin and had a nice breakfast sandwich. Everyone else cleaned their plates too.   would we go back? Yes we would. It was tasty and there are still many more things I want to try and I wouldnt feel too guilty about.  So check it out and dine happy!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time and I really enjoyed my meal.  I had smoke salmon frittata with Arugula on the side, it was delicious and I loved it! It was a perfect size and perfect flavor. The waitress also brought sunflower seed bread with strawberry jam and it was super delicious! Overalls food and service were excellent, I will definitely comeback. Thank you first watch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it's a great find. Luis was our server and he's awesome, as are the other employees. The menu is diverse and I had very little difficulty choosing what I wanted to eat. I had the market hash skillet which was delicious and my boyfriend had a super good omelette. We'll be back to try the waffles/pancakes very soon!"}
{"text":"First Watch is amazing. When we first walked in we loved. The decor, the vibe, everything was great. We ordered the elevated egg sandwich which was so good and the breakfast tacos were also delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and love this restaurant. Great menu options, healthy choices and I LOVE that I have the option to pay a little extra to have real maple syrup. I don't love the reservation system... folks who physically arrive at the restaurant should have priority over those who sign in on an app..."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is healthy, fresh, reasonably priced, and DELICIOUS. This place gets busy but they have a large community table for those dinning solo or with a friend. I went on a busy Sunday morning and was in and out in 30 minutes because of the community table. Waitress was friendly and helpful too! Also, the fresh juices are so refreshing and hydrating. My favorite item is the avocado toast, I could eat it everyday."}
{"text":"Look no further. This brunch restaurant has everything. From their reasonable prices to amazing food, I would 10/10 recommend. This First watch is without a doubt, as good as it gets. The waitresses aren't too bad looking either, fellas!"}
{"text":"I am not a big breakfast eater, but I could never pass on First Watch.  This place has tasty and creative sandwiches, combos, etc.  We stopped in during the week and were seated right away.  I ordered the elevated egg sandwich and my wife ordered the avocado toast.  The elevated egg sandwich has applewood bacon, fried egg, avocado, gruyere cheese, and arugula on a brioche bun. It was delicious!  The avocado toast was two thick pieces of wheat toast with avocado and two eggs.  She said it was very good.  She really likes the coffee here also."}
{"text":"I really like the Avocado Toast, but that's about it. I've tried several other things on the menu and didn't care for anything. They have an egg-white omelette that had no flavor at all, and was greasy, the service is mediocre and it's always slow getting the food and getting serviced."}
{"text":"Had coffee and the Breakfast Scramble. Their description: \"A croissant topped with scrambled eggs with spinach, ham and melted cheese, then topped with hollandaise and served with fresh fruit.\" The croissant wasn't toasted and the eggs were a little runny (which I don't like in scrambled eggs), but it was otherwise pretty tasty. The \"fresh fruit\" was just three cubes of watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe. I hate melons so I couldn't eat any of that - and the description should read \"fresh melon\" and not the much broader term \"fruit\". The home fries - cubes of pan grilled potatoes - also tasted like they had been sitting under a lamp for a bit before I got to them. The coffee was pretty good for a diner and they had different flavoured creamers which is always a bonus since I hate regular ol' half-n-half. However, the waitress was a little slow on refilling the carafe as well as bringing the requested water (which was definitely tap). It was not busy at all. $27 pre-tip for basic coffee and two breakfast plates. Yikes. Over all, this is basically a Denny's trying to be trendy. I've had better food (and service) at iHop."}
{"text":"My family and I come here every Sunday and we're never disappointed, I look forward to it all week! I particularly enjoy their waffles, (with the delicious warm syrup which they always bring before your food arrives so you have it right when you need it) and the scrambled eggs, which are always cooked to perfection! My kiddo and her dad love the bacon! Kid meals are all under $6 including a drink and come with generous sized portions. The servers are all excellent; very attentive and friendly. Also love the rustic, homey environment. Definitely my favorite breakfast place in the valley."}
{"text":"Prices too high, portions too small, wait staff horrible, food is bland. I dont understand why this place is always busy. Ive been there 4 times and was disappointed every time."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I loved the menu. I had a skillet and it was delicious. The toast was to die for. My little one even loved it even though it looked healthy. Service was okay, having not been to Arizona in about 10 years, I loved being about to eat outside, but I think our server forgot about us at one point. And she gave me a snoody comment for asking for more silverware, we were one set short unless she expected my almost 3 year old to eat with his hands...  Over all I'd go back again because the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing food, deliciously healthy,  Eli is an amazing waiter, I guarantee you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"First Watch is always consistent. I had never been to this location before. I love the outdoor seating they have. We sat inside as it has already started to become uncomfortably warm again in Phoenix. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We placed and received our order in a very timely manner. Everything was great and to our expectations. I like that First Watch has seasonal menus with different options."}
{"text":"Today we came in to eat and felt the server was extremely rude. The server tried to almost rush us out, she didn't check up on drinks. The French toast was undercooked. I felt that this experience was a bit sour due to our server. The drinks however were great but again we only had one. I may go back again and see how it is but this was not a pleasant experience in what I assume to be a good restraunt."}
{"text":"We just LOVE this place! Their healthy food options, their organic or gluten free options, everyone can eat here! The servers are mostly all so friendly, some can be annoying but hey they are still nice. The only downside is if you go in the morning for breakfast their is always ATLEAST a 15-25min wait but that's for sure a good sign!"}
{"text":"This place is Clean, Large, everyone is friendly, the food options are AMAZING and there are so many options from health conscious, gluten free, vegetarian etc... The list goes on. It can be a little pricey but your health is worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a disappointment!  The place wasn't busy but it took over 5 minutes to get seated.  Once seated 3 different servers asked me what I wanted to drink.  10 minutes later still no coffee.  I decided to leave."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday with my wife and her parents for brunch.  My wife and I had been wanting to head to a first watch since we read about the one in Cranberry and only became more excited whenever we saw that one had opened in McCandless.  I have to admit that the inside of first watch wasn't really what I was expecting.  It was full of lots of wood (possibly reclaimed) and might look more in place out in the country.  That's not to say it wasn't charming as it was but it wasn't what I had expected.  After looking at the menu for a little while I ultimately decided on the farm stand breakfast tacos.  It was a tough decision as a lot of items on the menu are healthier and sound terrific.  That's actually one of the main reasons that we had been wanting to try it.  My tacos ended up consisting of some chorizo, eggs, avocado and cheese along with some pico de gallo.  Everything on the tacos was good and overall they were a solid breakfast choice but by the time I was finished I actually wished that I had chosen another of their options.    The bottom line for me is that I will head back to first watch again in the future.  I loved that they made their breakfast menu \"fun\" while also keeping it somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"A right place for breakfast  get early here- the waiting time could be 30-45 min before you get in."}
{"text":"Many delicious and healthy breakfasts. Just wish they were open with more reasonable hours. Hard for working people to get time to go there. Staff is always great."}
{"text":"The food is freshly made with excellent ingredients.  Distinct flavor combinations enhance the meals."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food.  You can join the waitlist and get seated right away.  Outdoor patio is dog friendly and very pretty."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast! I've been wanting to try this place for breakfast and glad I did! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service is fast and friendly. The only thing that kind of upset me is when I ordered, the waitress asked if I wanted bacon with that...as if it were part of the meal. It in fact wasn't and put an extra $4.50 on my lunch bill. It would have been a great priced lunch if that $4.50 wasn't tacked on for 4 slices of bacon. Really great food though."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with a nicely decorated interior! We love how the food always tastes very fresh. I always order the Parma Skillet Hash, which comes with toast, fruit, and your choice of eggs. The birthday coupon is definitely a plus; make sure to sign up for their email club!"}
{"text":"With many options to choose from and most of them delicious, First Watch is an excellent casual breakfast, brunch and lunch restaurant. The food is always served quickly with excellent service. While the atmosphere is slightly lacking, it more than makes up for it in their delicious french toast and other entrees.  The service is also high quality. The food always comes out fast, fresh, and hot. While I'm usually wary of places that market themselves as \"all-natural\" this place showed me it's not overblown, but actually a quality eatery. If your ever in Fairlawn and want some casual breakfast, brunch, or lunch definitely check out First Watch. And don't forget to use the app! It allows you to get in line beforehand and can save you a long wait."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! Great food and service. If you ever pop into this place, ask to sit in \"Greg's\" section. Super efficient and pleasant. I'm so full."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The food's delicious! Our favorite is the Multigrain pancake. Ask for Anisa she's a sweetheart and an awesome server."}
{"text":"This place has great food,  homemade juices and coffee. My kids love it and I think that they also have excellent salads! The atmosphere is very cute and upbeat too!  The Servers all do a really great job as well!"}
{"text":"American breakfast/brunch/lunch joint. Largely the entrees are traditional w/r/t the ingredients and combinations. food is always good, kitchen is clean (reassuring), but the service has been spotty the last few times (for example, I didnt receive my drink until the meal came)."}
{"text":"The BEST brunch and so close to home in the South Hills! The rustic farm decor is adorable, and free coffee and copies of the daily newspaper are located right inside the door-perfect to pass the time if you're waiting for a table. I started with the Morning Meditation juice-a refreshing concoction of orange, beet, lemon, organic ginger, agave nectar, and turmeric. My friend enjoyed her freshly brewed iced coffee as well. We both got the Cinnamon Chip Pancake breakfast-it is a treat to DIE for! Bacon was perfectly crisp, and the service was fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Our family of 5 loved it! Loved at the fresh ingredients! Kids loved the Chocolate Chip Pancakes. I had the newest egg sandwich. It had egg, greens, bacon, and avocado on it with a side of potatoes. My hubby enjoyed a Mexican skillet. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty busy over the weekend so we usually call our order in and pick it up. The food is usually pretty good, when they can manage to get the order right. After today's visit, they are at 40% accuracy. It's the same order each time... Today I decided to call in to ask about a possible refund for the items I was missing and was hung up on (I know what you're thinking but I was calm, I didn't raise my voice once and didn't deserve to be hung up on). Called back in to speak to management and got excuses. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Food was great & plentiful. However, I need to comment on how wonderful this restaurant was for dealing with my mother in a wide wheelchair. I was visiting over Christmas week & usually take her out from the nursing home for meals. The staff at Furst Watch saw me rolling her up to the door, helped me with the doors and seated us at a table where there was plenty of room. Additionally, the bathroom was spacious & well-designed for navigating with a wheelchair. Lots of places say they are handicap accessible, but FirstbWatch deserves an award. Thanks for making, what can be a stressful outing, very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I eat here with my cowerkers at least twice a week for breakfast before work. There's never a wait, the service is great, & the food is killer. I recommend the avocado toast to EVERYONE. Also their coffee is amazing. Go here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to stop & have breakfast. I went with something clean & healthy. The veggie omelet & potatoes"}
{"text":"I see many of these low ratings for this place and cant believe it!  The service here is TOP NOTCH, and the food is CONSISTENTLY great. To chastise a place that is so busy you have to wait is insane. Ever here of the app \"No Wait\"?  Try it, and please don't hate a place because it's busy!"}
{"text":"We like FirstWatch.  For years we went to the Promenade location until this Grayhawk location opened.  It is 1.2 miles from home, service is fast snd staff is friendly.   Favorites meals: avocado toast buttermilk pancakes great coffee oatmeal chorizo and eggs large dining area the wait time on weekends is not long  I think they are trying to address the rough seatbacks of the reclaimed wood - your clothes can snag a bit."}
{"text":"My wife & I came here yesterday and, well, we will not be returning or recommending this establishment. Back when this was the Good Egg, we didn't love it, but it was a good spot since it was close and convenient to our home.   We received a Buy One Get One Free coupon in the mail since they've revamped the place into First Watch. The reason for 1 star is due to their food and service.   Our waiter had a lot of tables, but, we could hear him checking on other tables but never us (each table around us he did check on every 5-10 minutes). I'm not a picky person and I understand sometimes service can be slow if you're slammed, but to never check in after setting the food down is UNACCEPTABLE.   I ordered the chickichanga which was the most Americanized Mexican dish I've ever tasted. I think Denny's may serve a better dish. It was super creamy and lacked meat. The presentation was awesome, but that was the only good part. My wife had the chorizo omelette which matched the same description as my meal. Also, the iced coffee was way to sweet, I have no idea if they have different versions (no sugar, light milk, etc) as the server never checked back.   When I went to pay the tab another employee asked how the meal was, but I lied and said \"it was good\" as there was a line of waiting customers to be seated and I felt that would leave the host in an awkward place."}
{"text":"This place was great! Reasonably priced compared to Boston! Healthy menu options. I had one of the best Belgian waffles- light and airy! And the bacon, perfect!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice, both late in the morning on Sunday. There was not a huge wait either time to get seated, but the service was HORRENDOUS both times. The first time our waiter was nice, but clearly forgot to put our order in as several other tables around us were seated, got their food, and left way before we recieved ours. We reminded the waiter that it had been a long time at the hour mark of waiting, and that's when I believe he put our order in again, because about 15 mins later it came out piping hot. The food was delicious though, so we decided to try again. This Sunday was a longer wait, but we realized it was because they had sent out BOGO coupons, nearly everyone around us had one! Shame, I wish we did! We hoped since they were doing a huge prommotion they had staffed for it but apparently not. Again, our order took over an hour to receive, but at least this time our waiter (nice older gentleman) kept checking on us and apologized. However, this time our food came out lukewarm. We were too starved to say anything, so we just ate and left. I really wanted to love this place as it's only 2 blocks from my house, but I don't know if I want to try again because of the crazy food wait times. Restaurant is really cute though, love the decor."}
{"text":"Driving back from MD to MI and found this place via Yelp!  Such a good change after all the hotel and bar food we have been eating.  Hubby and I each ordered the elevated egg sandwich. My kids split the chocolate chip pancakes. Everything was delicious. Coffee is excellent! Waitresses was nice, and pretty quick service too. We came near closing time, and it was still fairly busy, but the bathrooms could definitely use a cleaning. If we are ever in the area again we would totally go back to try some other things off the menu."}
{"text":"We love the food at First Watch Tempe. Especially the biscuits and Turkey gravy and hash browns, both myself and my g/f order it everytime. Excellent coffee too. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I never have any complains with First Watch. The breakfast is always superb and the service is always good.  Even though it is a chain restaurant it never gives the feel that it actually is."}
{"text":"First time here and I really enjoyed my brunch at this place. Seen it driving by but never stopped by, and today, by luck my friend and I wanted to go to a place and they were super busy so I looked online and this place showed up and I'm glad it did. After waiting for about 6\"5 minutes to be seated (until a table was cleared for us outside) we got a very nice server (Tania I think was her name) who greeted us with a smile and a pot of coffee :-) we asked a few questions and my friend was really interested to get the \"morning meditation\" but was hesitant about the beet juice and turmeric mix, so I asked for a sample and Tania  was kind enough to get us a sample (with no beet juice for my friend) and one for me as well. This drink was amazing and I ended up getting one.   For brunch I ordered their power breakfast quinoa bowl with an extra egg. The dish was absolutely delicious, quinoa, Italian sausage, kale criminology mushrooms and tomatoes. The right portion of everything. Filling and tasty, and I loved it.   A place where you can find great service as Tania was super nice and sweet, amazing food and tasteful arrangements, and the location was superb. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This quaint but busy restaurant was our choice for a light breakfast on a Sunday Morning. Upon entering we were greeted with big smiles and hello's. We were seated, and our waitress came over promptly. I ordered the steel-cut oatmeal and a cup of hot chocolate. The oatmeal was cooked perfectly, and was served with fruit, pecans and a side of brown sugar and milk. My hot cocoa was delicious and topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup! YUM!  This restaurant is adorned in a country theme. They pride themselves on fresh, local, healthy menu options. The restaurant was clean, the service was friendly, and the prices were slightly above average compared to other restaurants of similar style. We will be back when we want a light breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and reviews were accurate. Busy holiday crowd. Food was delicious but service s bit off."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I got the works omlet and I think I expected it to taste more homemade rather than commercial like. The omelet seemed as tho it was pre made of made in a omlet maker  and then the insides added in after it was cooked so it just wasn't what I expected at all. Don't know if I would try anything made with eggs there again but will try some of the other stuff !"}
{"text":"Glad this location is finally open, it's an alternative to the regular breakfast places around Gilbert. So many breakfast places around, some terrible and others just ridiculously crowded for mediocre food. First Watch has good food, nice and clean new building, staffs polite and it's not super crowded yet. Easily recommended."}
{"text":"The food is pretty fresh tasting.  We have always had good service.  The servers seem happy to help and accommodate all requests.   Overall, pleasant experience."}
{"text":"While the actual breakfast items and coffee are fine - the errors in ordered items was unacceptable!  Two out of three dishes came out wrong.  Example: breakfast burrito (with eggs in it) came without eggs!  When my husband mentioned it to the server, the server offered to bring him eggs on the side!!  Not exactly how a breakfast burrito works, thank you.  Manager missed their opportunity to have us back by asking how everything was, then not removing mistake items.  Service also slow.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best avocado toast in town! Their morning meditation juice is also very yummy. great atmosphere and very clean!"}
{"text":"This morning's breakfast was the seasonal crab and asparagus omelette.  There was hardly any crab in it, the asparagus was very small and dried out plus the potatoes were under cooked.  The toast was excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit after the name change. Breakfast was perfectly prepared and promptly served. I had an off menu order... A couple scrambled eggs and crispy bacon. My iced tea was kept full as expected. I'm so glad I have a place for breakfast everyday! I can't wait to try something else :-)"}
{"text":"ATTENTION: Very, super-important notice - do not dine here if you are wanting a semi-greasy breakfast (i.e. think IHOP or Denny's). It is VERY health-conscious and \"clean\".   I believe I would have appreciated their clean menu/food preparation more if I was in the mood for something \"real\" and \"light\". But, 2 Saturdays ago, I just wasn't. You know?? I wanted some shredded, fatty cheese in my Omelette (Spanish-style) but it ended up... I dunno... very simple ingredients.   And, a side of green salad with my Omelette and wheat toast? Eeehhhh... no...:( I mean, don't get me wrong - love my non-Iceberg lettuce salads, but for breakfast/brunch? NOOOO!!!  Service was speedy, smily and genuine. Be prepared for a wait to get a table on Saturday morning also.   Final note: if you have a Yelp app and an Apple iPhone - be cautious as my directions led me south of the actual location by 1-2 miles. I dunno what happened there??"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at First Watch today for brunch.  We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  Our server Savannah, was excellent.  We made a special order that was not on the menu, but she went in the back and worked it out with the cooks to make sure all our needs were met.  The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"We've been to many first watch locations and are usually very satisfied with both the food and service. When this location finally opened, my family was so excited since it's down the street from our house. There were so many people working, we were greeted by smiling faces and a good first impression. However, our food was brought out incorrect, the portions seemed much smaller than we've ever had and our service was so-so. Our water sat empty almost the entire time we were eating and with as many people standing around providing smiles, it seems like they should at least be helpful to the servers. Then our bill comes and my husband and I were both charged for coffee without having any drinks for the table. When we told the sever, she was confused why were telling her and had to 'double check' our table. We'll give this location another shot when it's more established but today we were not super impressed."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the First Watch chain. This was my 1st visit to the Camelback location. I ordered the trifecta and coffee. Had to send the trifecta back. The pancake was dark brown and the bacon was burned to a crisp. The coffee was sooooooo bitter. The waitress at the cash register said it was \"something in the tap water\". No emotion. Not going back to that location."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were in town to visit our auntie and she recommended this great spot for tasty Brunch! Located in a strip mall as a diner style, it is not much to look at.. but once you are seated and are perusing the menu options you will be very happy with your options here. They serve healthy smoothies and fresh juice drinks as well as pretty good coffee. I liked that they left a small carafe of it as we are serious coffee drinkers (as in we need a lot of it.. not necessarily fancy about it, LOL!)  The seasonal menu right now is off the hook, don't even open the reg menu just look at the seasonal page, currently showcasing \"Millionaires Bacon\" a tasty sweet and spicy coated bacon that we shared; they also have the seasonal \"Pumpkin pancakes\" that looked great but I chose the \"Farmers Biscuit Sandwich\", it was all-natural pork sausage, an over-easy cage-free egg and Sharp Cheddar on a grilled, freshly baked biscuit topped with lemon-dressed arugula, mayo and apple butter. Served w/ seasoned potatoes. It made for a perfectly tasty hearty brunch meal! The biscuit was fluffy with a nice crunch on the bottom.The Breakfast BLTE was another 'win' for our table and I think that one is always on the menu. Both the tomato and a Squash soup was very tasty here as well! All in our party loved their meals. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"We, stopped here for breakfast our first time. Place was relatively busy, but we got seated right away. Place was clean & everyone was friendly. We had Eggs Benedict - Florentine & \"Everything\" Smoked Salmon Benedict & a side of bacon. Some of the best hollandaise sauce in Arizona, very happy  with this place. Oh also the coffee was very delicious. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Flew in to visit the in-laws and dropped in for lunch. The food was outstanding and I am a major foodie. The Kale Tonic is absolutely fantastic and the Skillet Hash is to die for. The service was fabulous and the GM Mike came out to check on us and make sure everything was great. Ive been saying for awhile that Phoenix is really starting to grow as a foodie Mecca and this only helps solidify its position. Best breakfast/lunch spot in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food; great service! Indoor and outdoor service. Every time I have been there it is almost a full house. Good healthy options too."}
{"text":"The service here is really great. I usually come to First Watch when family is in town visiting. My latest visit was right before y aunt and uncle had to catch a flight home. We let the waitress know that we were short on time and she got our order in and our food out quickly, even though the restaurant was packed. We were overall very happy with the service."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!!! Our waiter Jared was very attentive. The banana pancakes and kale juicer were bomb."}
{"text":"Great light lunch food. Healthy choices and ok prices. I really enjoyed the smoothies and muffins. Not opened for dinner for coke for breakfast or lunch. Plenty of parking so bring your friends"}
{"text":"I forgot to snap a picture of our food before we are it all up. I had avocado toast and hard boiled eggs. Hard to mess up but they added so much flavor. But besides the fold being wonderful I'm really doing this review for the service. From the time we walked in grear service. But Hannah our server was awesome. Such a sweet person but officiant and super kind. Helpful when questions on the menu as well. She knew all her stuff.. I'd go back for the food but id more so go back to see Hannah!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service, great menu options as well. This place continually does a great job. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Went here today with my mom. We usually love First Watch, however,? we went today and both got the classic eggs benedict. Both of our eggs were so hard, we got barely any ham, and our food was delivered cold. Service was great tho."}
{"text":"It's a great healthy fix for breakfast. I got the green juice and it was delicious. My SO got the carrot juice and that was equally as tasty just with a very pronounced carrot flavor. I had the quinoa bowl and my SO ordered an omelet. They were both well made packed with lots of flavor. I'd recommend anyone look for a quick healthy meal, they get busy on the weekends and service was a bit slow so I docked the a start for that but the food was good so 4 stars. I'd come back not during peak brunch time."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy. I've eaten here twice within its first week of opening. Normally healthy doesn't appeal to the masses but I can assure you their food will not be regretted. I love the kale tonic, sweet pecan salad and Monterey club."}
{"text":"Came with our softball group when in town for a PGF qualifier. Food was great, had the Bacado Omlette, very tasty. Everyone in my group was pleased with the quality, and variety. Only wish was that I had two stomachs so I could try the lemon ricotta pancakes! (Which I was told we are excellent)"}
{"text":"This place was great. The waitress was prompt and friendly.  I took a couple friends and they all enjoyed their food and had no complaints.  Very relaxed environment."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the morning meditation juice. Food was absolutely disgusting for myself and my husband. We will never return."}
{"text":"What is with the staff at this location? We walked in there were about 5 servers huddled at the register, one which sat us at our table and then went back to the huddle with the other servers. It took a good 5-7 minutes for someone to finally come out and offer us for coffee. The servers continued their chit chatting/ huddle even after we kept staring, paying no regard to their customers.  Such bad customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go yesterday. The farmhouse hash and French toast. Would have been ok and I mean just ok but the avocado was rotten. Totally inedible. Big black spots all over it. Not exactly what I would call fresh."}
{"text":"Always excited to run into a First Watch when we travel!  Great service and good food with plenty of healthy options."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was too slow. 40 minutes to get our food. This must improve or they will lose business"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch with my mother, grandmother around 10:30. They were not extremly busy but there was a rush. But I have to say the customer service is terrible, I have worked in the restaurant business for quite a few years and I must say this is sad how no one seems to have a  personality or even a smile."}
{"text":"This is a shame- as a frequenter of the downtown location we were in need of a hearty breakfast after my sons swim meet in Anthem.  I suggested this place- 20 minute wait- no big deal. We get seated, wait another 10 before the waitress, who went to a table that was seated 5 minutes AFTER us and took their order!  She see us now, and takes our order for drink/food Ok, I think, simple mistake.. We wait, and wait - table next to us gets their food... Ok it should be anytime.... We wait.. And wait- .  Now explain to me this,  how is it, that a table that is seated after us, order taken at the same time is finished with their meal before we even get our food???  (2adults/1child) Food was just \"ok\".   See attached photos- There is some obvious management/kitchen/waitstaff issues here.   Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Constantly serving delicious healthy fresh food. Best breakfast in town. Good coffee and great kale tonics! I recommend the Parma hash... I get it every time we eat breakfast here. The avocado toast is a great summer dish. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new. This place is good on so many levels. It's definitely got the trendy healthy options if that's what you're looking for. Avocado toast was something I saw being served at least three or four times while I was there. Didn't order it but it looked great. I had the market veggie sandwich - wow! So much flavor.       Hubby tried a fresh squeezed juice. Very tasty and fresh! They do have some traditional meat and potato options as well as pancakes and waffles. The decor is light and airy - and the seating is comfortable. (Oh and I noticed the table was reclaimed wood - USA made - nice touch)       My husband remarked that everything had depth of flavor - seems like they really care about their recipes and flavor. And my two year old smashed his entire chocolate chip pancake plus his bacon!       We will definitely be back! I wanted to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was very uncomfortable with the service I received at this restaurant today and because of that, I cannot recommend it. The waitress was truly surly. When I asked for a fresh cup of coffee, she sullenly replied that it would take 9 minutes. When I asked for eggs Benedict, she flippantly asked \"which kind?\" When I said the traditional with muffin Canadian bacon and egg...she said, \"we don't have that.\" Then she literally picked up the menu and threw it at me to look at the selections. I will not be back. I recommend Matts Big Breakfast across the street. The food is better and the servers are friendly, professional and helpful."}
{"text":"The food and service is good, but it is a bit pricey for the portion you get.  They do seat you right away."}
{"text":"Decor looks nice. Decent  service. Food presentation is nice. BUT Food was expensive. Portions were on the small side.  Overall 3 stars  It was just okay."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. It was just awful and we will never go back again!My son ordered off the kids' menu...the half waffle and the sausage. The sausage was raw on the inside. Yes, raw and mushy.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with soft poached eggs.  While sage tasting brown gravy isn't my idea of biscuits and gravy,  it was OK. The biscuit was nice and soft. The potatoes are more steamed..not good.  However, the eggs came in the texture of hard boiled.  After all the above, this is why we will never go back:  I asked if I could please have new soft poached eggs because these eggs were hard boiled she said, \"I guess I can order you less poached eggs\". After having watched another waitress make several faces at her customers  when she turned her back to the customers, I decided not to get into a discussion on the difference between boiled and poached and take whatever was presented to me.  After she delivered my new eggs, one of which was perfect and the other which was overdone, we never saw her again until bill time or I would've asked for the milk that was not delivered with my sons kid's meal.   DISAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"No other breakfast compares!! Service is just as amazing. Cheap, fast, delicious, friendly and clean? What more could you want from where you eat?!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot and better than some of the other FW locations I've visited.   The service is friendly and fast and the food is always delicious. My fave is the pesto chicken quinoa bowl. Very flavorful and filling, yet still fairly healthy."}
{"text":"Best breakfast / Great service  I put us on the waiting list via Yelp but people were being seated quickly anyway on a busy weekend. We initially wanted to sit outside but decided we were too hungry to wait.  Our food did not take long once we ordered. I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine which they serve on ciabatta bread. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Side of greens went perfect with it. Really well done and beautifully plated. I should've taken a photo but it looked so good I just dove in!  The restaurant itself is cute....it's a large bright room with farmer's market type decor. You can see into the kitchen. There are lots of windows on the street side and therefore lots of light. Wood elements warm up the space.    You pay the bill at the register not the table. This must speed up table turnover and allow the wait staff to concentrate on service. Smart.  I can't wait to go back!  It will be difficult to decide between ordering the benedict again or trying something else."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I have NEVER written a bad review on Yelp, ever.   My experience at this restaurant was horrendous.   Arrived at around 12pm, the lady at the front gave us a 30-40 minute wait estimate.  Gave her our number to text when the table was ready.  35 minutes later, we went back in to check; the lady said it would be another 15-20 minutes.  We went back in at 1:20pm - The lady said that she was able to sit us down immediately.  \"We texted you 30 minutes ago\"  I asked her what number she sent the text to, it was written down wrong. Completely unapologetic, she sat us down. Time was 1:25pm The food arrived at our table at 2:01. The table next to us received their food, ate it, chatted, and had left.   Omelette was luke warm, food bland.  I could not make this stuff up.   At least it was bad enough to prompt my first review on Yelp after years of using the app."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time!! It's a very fresh and kinda earthy place so if you don't like that kind of thing it might not be your cup of tea but for me (and my bf who actually usually doesn't like earthy) it was perfect!! Compliments to the chefs, they are amazing! And the ladies in the front were extremely nice as well. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have visited this restaurant dozens of times and it is always hit or miss.  Today is was terrible. It was a cool morning so outside seating was closed. They did not handle the crowd well. When we checked in we were told 15 minutes. No problem we'll wait. But then when they started seating people out of order we complained. Finally, we were seated but whoever bussed the table did a crappy job, it was filthy. The glasses were dirty and one of the coffee cups had paper stuck to the inside. We sent them all back with the server. She was obviously pissed because she just ignored us after that.  After waiting a few minutes for service we walked out.   This restaurant is sorely in need of some new management. I realize that it is hard to get good help this far north, but this crappy service cannot continue. It will eventually catch up with you."}
{"text":"I got the coconut chia seed pudding with wheat toast and almond butter and it was amazing! Very big portion with lots of fruit and totally filled me up. There was enough for 2 people there, but I ate most of it because it was so good. My mom got tomato soup and said it was delicious too, and we are picky eaters. :)"}
{"text":"My dining experience here was top notch from the second I walked in. I felt instantly welcome and right at home. The service was excellent and swift. The food was warm and cooked to perfection. I'm so happy to finally have a breakfast place so close to home."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre with absent minded server, clumsy lady that brought our food to the table, and just an overall feel that it was not a smooth running operation. Food was actually good.  Glad to see they served chilaquiles! Although nowhere near as good as those offered at authentic Mexican places... It was a good attempt. What's with the First Watch name? I felt that we were driving up to an urgent care center or some kind of a security alarm store. I think I liked the cheerful bright atmosphere better when these were Good Egg restaurants. Not the darker, pretentious, artificially hip Scottsdale environment that this one exudes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at First Watch several times.  The restaurant is always busy and you would expect at least good food or good service; but you really won't get either.    We arrived for brunch, about 11:30.  The restaurant was very busy, but they seemed to be seating people pretty quickly and we only waited about 10min.  We ordered, and waited for our food......and waited......and waited.  We watched as most of the tables around us received their food; even those seated after us.  Finally after about 25 min we received our food....cold.  It was pretty clear our food had sat for awhile before arriving at our table.  My husband had ordered the Tri-fecta, which consisted of some egg-beaters, two greasy, half cooked pieces of bacon, and a small, cold pancake.  For a man who NEVER complains about his food; he couldn't stop.  Said it was the worst breakfast he had ever had.  For me, I order a kale salad off their specials menu.  Not really sure what was so special about it, other than it cost $9 for a super small portion.  Mostly consisting of kale, some dried out, old looking carrots, and some dried cranberries.  The dressing was super bland.  Not impressed, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had sourdough french toast with kiwi, strawberries, bananas, and blueberries with a side of eggs ($1.59 for an egg? Really? I can buy a dozen for that much!)  Anyway, pricy eggs aside, it was SO DELICIOUS. I ate the entire thing, even every last crumb of fruit. I loved it. It was reasonably priced, I got unlimited tea refills, and the server was just the cutest thing I've ever seen. It was like a very very nice and quaint version of denny's in terms of layout, not a lot of trendy indie stuff or whatever, but i loved it."}
{"text":"Love love this restaurant!! Healthy,happy... loved food . Loved service vice!! Fantastic"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. Good service and original offerrings. Think about greasy spoon without the grease."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  I was in town early for a business meeting, so I stopped in here for breakfast.  I ordered the Croquet Madame from their springtime special menu, along with a Morning Meditation juice and coffee.  The service was friendly, the food was very good, and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is always top notch here, and the service is impeccable. Today I called in my lunch to-go.  After being greeted by name at the door (I've only been in three or four times), I added to the order and while I was waiting (they were lightning fast!), three customers walked in behind me to either be seated or also to pick up.  They were each greeted by name as well. Very friendly and attentive service every time!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Pleasant wait staff. Only down side is how busy it gets on weekends, but it's worth the wait. Try the avocado toast, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"300th review!   I was impressed with First Watch! I pass by it all the time but today was the first time I've tried it.  Located where the Good Egg used to be years ago in the North Thunderbird shopping center, it has nice indoor decor and atmosphere with some outside seating. We got a booth near the front and our server, Jared, was attentive and friendly. I ordered two eggs, a waffle and their seasoned potatoes. I've never had a bag egg, and the potatoes were delicious and crunchy. The Belgian waffle was light and airy as the description shares and the cherry jam on the side tasted freshly made. My friend and I appreciated the quick service of our food and check.  It was a good value for the price I paid and their lunch menu has a few veg options which is always a plus. Their avocado toast sounded delightful so I know what I'm ordering next time."}
{"text":"First Watch is serving up a breakfast that will keep you coming back!  I originally ventured to Settlers Ridge to meet a friend at Panera, but we ended up wandering over to First Watch instead. Upon arriving there was a line and I was a little discouraged, but I very quickly received a text that our table was ready!  Upon being seated our waitress gave us our own pot of coffee and water carafe, which I actually really enjoyed. I loved having coffee refills without trying to flag down the waitress on a busy Sunday morning.  Inside we ordered Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Healthy Turkey. I don't typically order juice at restaurants, but I also tacked on a Spring Hydrate juice because it sounded enticing with cucumber, pineapple, coconut water, and lemon. It was delightful and very refreshing. The Healthy Turkey was very good, but the Lemon Ricotta took the prize.  The inside of the restaurant is a little confusing because it is very plainly decorated and almost looks like a chain, but the menu itself is almost artisan!  For breakfast it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and our server was the best.... Everyone was really nice including the manager will Def eat at this place again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited First Watch three weeks before and had a great time, however, this visit (9/25, 1:15 pm) was at the opposite end of the spectrum. I am only doing this review as a result of the manager's failure to follow through. I ordered the biscuits and gravy while my wife ordered the soup and sandwich. Our meals arrived with my eggs over easy (I asked over medium - there is a difference) and the gravy was lukewarm at best. My wife received the clam chowder whereas she ordered the squash soup. They delivered the correct soup and my meal the second time around but once again, the gravy was lukewarm. I asked for the check to which the server said she would ask to consult the manager. The server came back and told us our meals were comped and apologized. I expected my meal to be comped but was disappointed the manager didn't approach us. First Watch will never know what happened and will never know what they can do make sure it doesn't happen again (i.e. turning up the temperature on the gravy or letting it sit in the microwave a little longer)."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a friend the other day.  The menu is so varied I had a tough time choosing what to eat.  I ended up trying the frittata - outstanding, I'd order it again.  My friend had an omelet which was also delicious.  You know how the coffee at some of these places sometimes tastes bitter and burnt?  Not here - it was smooth and rich and our server \"kept it coming\" as per our request.  The booths are super comfy.  My friend and I lingered for some time and no one bugged us.  The bill was totally reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.  Recommended - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always good service. They have an app if you are waiting. Also, for someone who commented on portion sizes, this isn't a diner. They aren't going to shovel a ton of eggs and bacon on your plate. All the meals I have eaten, from healthy choices to pancakes, have come just as I would expect. Their coffee while you wait is a nice perk."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to First Watch for an early lunch. This was a while back. I was quite impressed on how fresh the food is. Our server provided outstanding service. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Price is quite economical. You receive a lot food for the price. Highly recommend this restaurant for lunch. Thank you for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Friend and I stopped in for brunch. First Watch is an exceptional restaurant with very healthy fresh meal choices. Great customer service and very affordable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, but the kitchen is still working out kinks. In our four top party two of us got our entrees a full ten minutes before the third person and the fourth person waited another ten minutes for their food. This threw off the timing of the meal and made for a less than stellar experience. We addressed it with the manager who simply stated that he appreciated our feedback and reminded us that they had only been open for three weeks. The Chicken Chimichurri Bowl had next to no chicken in it. The manager said he would take care of us which we thought meant he would discount a  portion of the meal, but he did not do anything for us."}
{"text":"This is a new location I've wanted to try. I've eaten at the other locations. This by far was the worst First Watch experience I've ever had. With so many competing restaurants in the area, I would expect the customer service to at least be a consideration. In this case it's not even an afterthought. The waiter serving us was cocky and arrogant. After I asked for water, we waited almost 10 minutes and then he just dropped a bottle water on our table and left without comment. When we asked for a  breakfast burrito to be open face we were told no. When I told him I wanted a pancake and no toast, he told me I couldn't have it. I explained to him I was willing to pay for the pancake and I didn't want toast. Everything was an argument. When the pancake came, it was supposed to The whole grain. It was the whitest pancake I've ever had. There was no multi grain to it. When I told him I didn't want it to take it off my bill he became confrontational and went and got the manager. And I was told in no uncertain terms that they didn't have buttermilk pancakes. And that that was considered their multi grain. I explained to  that I didn't call it a buttermilk pancake but there was no fiber to it, t tasted terrible and I didn't want it. The waiter came back with the adjusted bill and made it clear he wasn't happy with us. I never saw him again. Bottom line, there's too many good practice breakfast joints in the area to deal with bad service mediocre food and arrogant wait staff. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I am sitting here at the restaurant. I was starving and wanted fresh breakfast food and all I can really say is, what a huge disappointment!!!!!  I order just a simple plate and everything tasted as if it was out all day  so disgusting. I was starving so I ate majority of it. I am not one to try to get a free meal but I will leave review on here and hope no one else gets such a disgusting meal. No one asked me either how my meal was or I would had told them the truth. Waitress just came and dropped off the bill. If you want breakfast food please go to the original first watch off of Thomas. They Have Better Food AND Better Service! Maybe it's my fault for coming in an hour before closing because obviously the chef doesn't care about the quality of his food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite First Watch Restaurant!  I recently took out of town visitors to have brunch there, and they did not disappoint.  Food was great, the service at door was very welcoming and best of all my avocado toast was the best of any of the other First Watch restaurant!  The five-star rating would of been the complete experience, however, the waitress may have been having a tough day."}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin pancake breakfast and it was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the chicken sausage, but maybe that just isn't my thing. The eggs were a little bland, but they were at least light and fluffy. The coffee was great! It was strong and flavorful. The service was amazing. Our waitress was very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Not only was the food fast and delicious, what I had purchased was decently priced. The staff was friendly and welcoming.... BUT I found it a little hard to find Someone when I needed them. Besides that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Holy crap! They have pancakes with BACON and CHEESE in them!  Seriously, though. This daytime only cafe serves to the health conscious and those that throw caution to the wind and eat pancakes with strips of awesome bacon in them.  They have a list of delicious, organic, fresh ingredients that they put together like a boss: for instance - Fresh Fruit Crepes: Two crepes with strawberries, bananas and pineapple covered with organic strawberry yogurt, granola and a fresh muffin.  I haven't been as happy with their mid-day fare, but with breakfast available all day, I honestly don't give it a second thought."}
{"text":"Love that they use Nowait here!  We were seated right away.  Little pricier than most places for breakfast ($3 for coffee or juice), and the food itself is good.  If you like your scrambled eggs cooked all the way, do not order them.  They were still a bit \"gooey\" when I got them.  Portion sizes are good, bacon is delicious and so is the whole grain toast."}
{"text":"First Watch almost always has a wait in Solon. Luckily, they offer free coffee and decent seating as you wait to be texted. If you can get to First Watch before or after the church crowd, you'll likely be seated right away. Set that alarm!  The food at First Watch is always fast, reliable and delicious, and i've never ordered anything I didn't care for. I love that they always have new specials, and recently added a juice bar to the menu. The French Toast Monte Cristo has become one of my favorite brunch options, and I crave it anytime i'm on the east side.   Despite being a chain, this First Watch feels cozier then most. The restaurant is very clean and comfortable, has a good free wi-fi connection, and great service. The servers are extremely attentive (many of them local students), and the noise level is moderate. I love that this location is open until 2:30pm most days. Once you're done with brunch, its all too easy to wander through the stores in Uptown Solon and create a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"3 stars for the simple fact the food wasn't bad. I've eaten at FW in Raleigh and enjoyed it. This was my first time ordering take-out. I went in and ordered my take out at the register. Normally I don't mind waiting a little while for take out if I know the food is great, but almost 30 minutes I believe is a bit long, even if dining in. Not only did it take 30 minutes (for a salad), but they didn't get my order 100% correct. I ordered the avocado chop salad, based mostly off the fact that it comes with Avocados. Yet, despite the name of the salad, they left the avocados off. That's right, not a single piece of avocado on the AVOCADO chop salad. Also, no napkins or eating utensils were provided in my to-go bag.  Pretty disappointing first time experience at this Matthews location."}
{"text":"Great place to go for brunch. There aren't many brunch places in River, so it usually gets pretty packed. But the food is always great and I'm always happy with the service."}
{"text":"They offer great and healthy food choices. It's always pretty busy so if you have the \"nowait\" app, you can see how long the wait will be and hold a spot in line before you even arrive. Pancakes are huge!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great food and a good atmosphere and service. All at a great price! The blueberry pancakes are delicious and huge as advertised. The only thing preventing a five star review is that I ordered 2 pancakes but only got one. Hoping for 5 stars next time. Frequent this place. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Root Down juice is D-Lish!  Fig Prosciutto on toast is yummy! Going for the lemon ricotta pancakes today! Cant wait to try all the menu items"}
{"text":"First watch always has good food! The avocados were a little on the un ripe side on my avocado toast. Lemon blueberry quinoa pancakes were very good! Half Hour wait to be seated , half hour wait for kitchen to prepare food.  Obviously little understaffed.the bacon was over cooked and tasted like it had been sitting in The warmer for quite a  while- disappointing for five dollar bacon. The hostesses were not very pleasant we weren't thanked for how long we had to wait and we weren't asked when we left if our food was good and as well we weren't thanked on the way out the door. At least the server was friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Well I liked it.  Very healthy stuff if you need to worry about that kind of thing.  Thankfully they serve some good traditional breakfast food, perhaps a little too formulaic and \"safe\", but a pancake and bacon dish will delight. The coffee is a bit poor, but like most US eateries, they tend to go heavy on the filter blends and less on the higher grades of beans. If it was my restaurant - the coffee would be a much higher quality.  My American colleague was underwhelmed, but then, he's been spoiled with Mexican breakfasts.  In conclusion it's ok, but nothing that would earn a Michelin star."}
{"text":"When I went weekly to the downtown location, they knew how to do it right. We went to this location and the quality and even the way things are made is just not as good. The salsa is watery, not much bacon on the bacado, and no marble rye. or Rye at all. Do they not know that we East coasters need our rye bread? I will hit downtown again to see if that remains solid..."}
{"text":"This used to be my fave place. The omelets choices were all stellar. I met two friends here last weekend and we were all disappointed. I will be very detailed here as to why in the hopes they will fix it. First of all, the bacon in/on the bacado used to be crunchy, fresh and plentiful. This time, a few soggy pieces scattered. The cheese is different, I know they know the difference but the freshly grated mix was better. And almost no avocado. This for a rather expensive omelet. My friend got the scramble and said the same, just not special. Service was also not like it used to be. It seems they have gotten tired and complacent here and need to get their fire back. Seeing I used to meet friends here every weekend, I am hoping they will have a talk with the cooks there to bring it back to its former self."}
{"text":"Food was good service was ok. Our waitress wasnt very attentive. The lady who sat us was very unfriendly and was huffing around the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  This was going to be our 1st time there. We were told it was going to be a 10-15 min wait for my husband, 2 yr old and myself. That wasn't the problem.  Another couple came in and was told same time frame.  However, 2 ladies came in few mins later and were seated right away before us. The server who seated those ladies came back and looked at me. She asked if I needed anything.  I told her that we were waiting to be seated. We decided to leave after that rude 1st encounter. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Service is great.  Prices are good.  Owner is friendly and personable.  Food is terrific."}
{"text":"A+ on the décor.  It's really a good looking spot and quite a contrast to the previous tenant, The Good Egg, which is apparently owned by the same company.  I guess they just swapped concepts for the space.    The menu is varied, there were good specials, and the coffee was very good.  That's about what I'm looking for in a breakfast spot.  I opted for the iced coffee (too sweet, I'll go unsweetened next time) and the brisket hash special (brisket was too tough came with great toast on the side).  The salmon frittata was ok but needed some seasoning.  Overall the food was good.  Glancing around the restaurant it looked like everything that came out of the kitchen looked great.    I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu and I'm glad to have this option close to home."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place that I've tried on Phoenix! So many choices on the menu and everything was so fresh. Meals are around $10. I ordered the Chicken Chimichurri Hash and loved it. The whole wheat toast was great too. Good sized glasses of juice were only $3.99. I got the one with kale, apple, cucumber, and lemon and it was delicious. I will definitely be back here and will recommend it to friends :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick breakfast spot and tried this place on a whim. Interior was very nice, clean, bright, warm and homely. Staff was friendly and quick to seat and wait on us. Menu was pretty diverse, but still had your traditional breakfast items. I had the chikichanga that came with country potatoes and a small (think oversized shot glass) fruit cup and it was delicious. Pricewise it was pretty average to maybe slightly more pricey, but they also were nearly all organic and farm fresh items= worth it. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"First Watch offers a pretty decent breakfast.  Their menu is comprised of slight variations from traditional breakfast dishes cooked well and cooked right.  I ordered their bacon and avocado skillet and found myself satisfied and not stuffed with a good blend of flavors and an ideal ratio of toppings to potatoes.  My friend ordered the Acapulco Express omelet and enjoyed that its that blend of avocado and sausage made for an ideal brunch omelet.  The food is good, the wait is quick, and the service is friendly.  An added bonus is that they do separate checks.  I plan on coming back occasionally."}
{"text":"So I normally don't review because there are very few places worth it and a bad place isn't worth my time. AVOCADO TOAST IS INSANELY GOOD. Nothing is wrong with it... from the runny egg that isn't disgusting runny, bread and fresh avocado....yasss"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. Gets very busy on weekends so try to come here on a weekday morning if you can! There is a cute outdoor seating area with nice mountain views and palm trees. Everything in this part of town is almost brand new. I have tried two things on the menu avocado toast and the Super food bowl. Both were delicious! The Super food bowl is my favorite with coconut chia seed pudding and berries. It is served with toast with almond butter and sea salt. I like that they use local ingredients when possible. Service is just ok."}
{"text":"Good quality and healthy food. Went here for breakfast. Pro: Healthy, Tasty, Comfort food elevated. Con: cost more than your neighborhood diner, but worth it. Matcha latte pancakes on spring menu. Hint of matcha tea, not overwhelming. Come with blueberries and granolas drizzled with cream and blueberry sauce. It was perfect for me, didn't need extra syrup.   Avocado toast with eggs. Nice thick spread of avocado on grain bread with olive oil and hint of lemon. Loved it. Better if the bread was toasted just a little more with olive oil.  Quinoa protein bowel. They offered a few version. This bowel had quinoa cooked with kale,  cremini mushroom, Italian mushroom, tomato, and Parmesan cheese. Come out hot with two pouched eggs. Great taste. Better if it had 1/2 cup more of the quinoa mixture.   Not an every week breakfast unless you have the money. Definitely a special or 4 times a year place to have breakfast. However what are you willing to pay for good quality and healthy food. Our total bill with coffee was 35.00 and 7.00 for tip.   Love the farm house decor. They had coffee and water while you wait. Coffee pot left at table, pour when you want hot coffee topped off.  Would recommend this place. 5 stars if portion slightly more and price 10% less."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I loved the environment, well decorated place. I am giving 2 stars due to the food and a snappy waitress.  I ordered the eggs Benedict BLT and my bread was cold and hard. It was overall too salty and sour for my taste. As for the service, the hostess and majority of the staff was super nice! My only problem was with one waitress. There was a waiter that said we were his first official order (he's new and I guess it was his first day on the job as a waiter). He was nice and made great eye contact. As he was about to take our order and took out his pad to write our order, this other lady waitress came and took over. I'm pretty sure she was only suppose to supervise him. However, she took our order and did all the talking soon after. She moved quick, but she was rude. I ordered an ice tea and did not receive it. She brought the check out to us and I asked if the ice tea was on the check because I never received it. She said she'll bring it out to me, I said I didn't need it anymore since we were done eating and she quickly snapped the check and walked off. She came back, dropped off the new check, and said \"have a nice day\". Not once did she apologize for not getting me my ice tea or made eye contact with my mom and I. After a couple of minutes later, my mom and I spotted the new waiter with his back pack going home. Hopefully, he was going home because his shift was over, not because that crazy waitress lady sent him home. I think he would make an excellent waiter. The lady waitress was too much in a rush....it wasn't even rush hour."}
{"text":"Sooo sad the good egg was taken over by this garbage. Went in today optimistic and was completely disappointed. My mom Ordered the turkey sausage biscuits and gravy. YUCK. The sauce made it taste like meat loaf it was disgusting!  I ordered the eggs benny florentine which was mediocre at best. & Our waitress didn't even ask us how the food was when she handed us our tab. Deff will not be going back here. Also expensive as hell for shitty food & service. AVOID!"}
{"text":"The potatoes are amazing!!! Had the avocado toast and it was good but my husband had the bacado omelette and it was amazing A must try"}
{"text":"First Watch is sooo good. The vibe is great, the food is bomb, and the service is generally pretty good. First Watch serves up high quality, homemade tasting food at moderately low prices. I enjoy the homey energy of their venue and the great patio at their Central/Thomas location. Try the Avocado Toast - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here based on most of the good reviews. My mom and I came here on 3/16 around 1:25 or so. First thing I noticed is that there was no air circulation in the place. It got super hot to where I had to wave a \"morning meditation\" drink menu in my face cause I was sweating(gross), which is rare for me to come across a restaurant that's hot inside and we weren't even near the windows. We had the worst experience with our waitress, I didn't even get the name- I'm sure it's on the receipt thrown away. She rarely came to check on us, maybe 3 times. The food was great besides the sausage links my mom had, they were raw in the middle and had them cook another one that was still pink. Then when we were checking out a young gentleman was trying to check us out, then our waitress interuppted him and told him to go do something else, that she would finish the transaction. I haven't had such bad service in a really long time. I'm not sure whether to go back to try again or not due to extremely poor customer service. Maybe get new waiters? I'm not sure what the deal was."}
{"text":"We really like first watch. The service is pretty slow and overall not great but the food is great! Their healthy drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for 2 at 10am and it was bit crowded. But the server notified us that it was taking a little longer than expected for our plates. The food came out sooner than expected and the food was great. Little one had a plain pancake with fruit and I had Floridian French toast that came with fruit. Everything was cooked right with the right amount of fluffiness in the bread. My big highlight was a seasonal drink they offered : Carrot/Chai Tea/Ginger juice. It was so refreshing that I am going to try to make it at the house."}
{"text":"I came here after my first choice was packed on a Sunday morning. They were able to seat me immediately at a communal table, and the waitress was great. I really enjoyed my smoked salmon frittata. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Went in with 3 friends and every single meal was delicious. Highly recommend this place. Best breakfast in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This location used to be the good egg. Wish it wouldn't have changed. Seemed like a trying to be a healthy food place. Not impressed.  Bacon was limp and didn't seem fresh, almost as though it had been delivered precooked like microwave bacon.  Multigrain pancakes were dryer than most.  Service was nice although a bit slow as was cooking time on the food. Place wasn't all that busy."}
{"text":"I've been thinking about their Floridian French Toast all day. What I enjoy about First Watch's breakfast dishes are the massive quantities of fresh fruit you get with your meal. I actually feel like I'm eating something healthy that doesn't end up sickly sweet.  I think the church crowd concern may be a little overrated. I've been at the Rocky River location the last few Sundays (at different times) and have yet to have a lengthy wait. Service can be a smidge slow, but the calm atmosphere allows you to relax and get into the \"take your time\" vibe."}
{"text":"I like First Watch for what it is:   A respectable neighborhood-based breakfast joint that's a cut above most cookie-cutter chains you'll find in the area.  We first visited a First Watch a couple of years ago. The Black Canyon location, which for some reason, has Yelp reviews that are disproportionately higher than the rest. We both liked it, but shortly forgot about it a few weeks after going.   Since then, they bought out The Good Egg and converted all of their existing locations, which has resulted in the \"brand\" becoming much more prominent throughout the city. Hell, there now seems to be one in practically every single neighborhood I've driven through.  Is it better than The Good Egg? Marginally. Is it in the same league as some of our favorite spots when you take into consideration what's available in Phoenix? Eh, I wouldn't go that far.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad, because it's not. Servers are prompt, food is fine, and the menu combines traditional breakfast items with a slight modern-flare that isn't overdone. There are a variety of healthy items on the menu, including the traditional not-so-healthy breakfast items.  I usually order scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and an English muffin. My girlfriend usually throws a granola pancake into her order. Eh, it's okay - but I have found more success with a competitor's \"Protein Pancake\" variation. Still though, it works for what it is, I guess.  Additionally, I've tried both of their Day Glow and Kale Tonic, which are good options if you're into that sort of thing.  While I wouldn't classify First Watch as anything spectacular, I see it more as a convenience on those days where we don't feel like driving out of our way for breakfast. And for that, it's just fine and dandy."}
{"text":"As mentioned in previous reviews, I love breakfast for lunch. The other day I had only 30 minutes for lunch between meetings. I was going to test my luck to see if I can order and consume an omelet within 30 minutes. I usually go to The Good Egg for breakfast for lunch but decided I would give First Watch a try.  The experience was satisfactory but not great. Server was polite enough but no personality. He did constantly fill my water which was a plus and he got my order in and food brought out quickly and efficiently.   I ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes. Omelet was okay but a bit bland. Thank God for hot sauce. The broccoli inside the omelet was raw which I found unappealing. A nice saute, steam, or roast to them would have made this omelet 10x better. The potatoes it came with were obviously previously frozen, lacked seasoning, and unevenly cooked.  The good news is that I was in and out of there in under 25 minutes.   I don't think I will return on my own to First Watch. I find the food to be tastier and the service friendlier at The Good Egg."}
{"text":"Went in today around 1:00pm.  About half filled. Serving staff polite and food was good. BUT unless you have unlimited time this is not a place to go. I'll be generous and suggest maybe they are under staffed. After I was seated - 10 min to get coffee, 20 min for the server to actually take my food order, 45 min to get my food  Lots of better alternatives in my area."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Something to satisfy everyone, even those who are into healthy food.  Atmosphere is nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Best breakfast and brunch in Phoenix. Breakfast tacos are bomb!"}
{"text":"Service was fine but the food, very forgettable! The pot roast hash was so-so n that's being kind. I decided on poached eggs; one egg was undercooked n the other egg was overcooked/deflated - I don't get it. The toast comes pre-buttered (why?) n is just way too thick."}
{"text":"Just got sat down and have asked for waffle. eggs, special bacon they offer. and a special blend juice they make. Juice and bacon are each $4 add on. All seems good and real good service. Was in at 7a opening time, and customers accumulating rapidly.  So all was very good. I had misunderstanding of bacon deal, but waitress kindly explained what and how she did this deal, which was actually better than my expectations. So all turned out great. Special blend juice was sure good, as waffle also, and I really did like the bacon. I'll be back.  Apologies to waitress for my misunderstanding. We all good here."}
{"text":"I have noticed this chain in the area but never stopped to test. I am positive impressions thus far. All was excellent and I will sure plan this again."}
{"text":"First Watch why it's a great place for breakfast. Had the feel of a neighborhood café. The food is good and the portions just right. One thing that brings us back is flexibility. They are very flexible when it comes to substitutions or special requests. Unlike other restaurants, they don't \"nickel and dime\" you  for everything. This is one of the main reasons we enjoy coming here. Plus they have a good selection of healthy breakfast. Soups are homemade and delicious... Especially the Italian wedding soup."}
{"text":"Tried the Tri-Athlete omelette and was very impressed! Hearty and tasty with thick wheat toast in the side.. made for a filling lunch! Great service and wide variety of options to choose from! Was surprisingly slow for lunchtime on a Friday though."}
{"text":"Delicious more healthful options and refreshing juices. Clean comfortable lively and relaxing atmosphere. Been here a few times. The food is consistently unique, well-crafted, more healthful than a \"greasy-spoon\", and flavorful."}
{"text":"The food is good, but this will be my last time visiting First Watch.  We waited about an hour for a table.  I wouldn't have necessarily minded the wait, but we were told the wait time would be about 20 minutes.  Because of the wait time, we had already chosen what to order.  As soon as we sat down, we ordered our food and waited another 30 minutes.  We spent two hours at First Watch -  a complete waste of my Sunday.    I can understand being busy, but this is about the third time I've visited First Watch on a Sunday and have had a similar experience. Each time, they used the same excuse of being a busy Sunday and understaffed.  If you know Sundays are busy, hire more people.      Good food, but the wait for a table and to receive food is ridiculous."}
{"text":"First Watch is always a solid and safe choice for breakfast... They have a healthy mix of breakfast indulgences and good for you options so there is something for everyone there. Their avocado toast is pretty amazing, their skillets and their regular bacon and eggs is spot on. I love that they are on the no wait app, so I can put my name in on my way into the restaurant and their service is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The food here is very good! However, it is always extremely crowded and noisey. I definitely recommend getting in line with the No Wait app (otherwise you will most likely face a long wait, no matter what day or time), and if you want to have an intimate or quiet conversation, this is not the place!"}
{"text":"If you feel like waiting an hour (after you sit down, not waiting for a table) to get your food and then have the order wrong then this is your place.  We usually go to the Fairlawn First Watch and have good service every time. Here: not so much.  Two of us went about 9:30AM this past Sunday (which is before the huge rush of people coming from church). We used the online app to get in line and when we got there we were seated promptly. Great so far. The place was full but not to the point where there were 30 people waiting for a table (which is usually the case at most First Watch's).  Well then it took our server about 7-8 minutes to even come over and get our drink order. She returned pretty quickly and took our order. Ordered normal breakfast, nothing special order. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. How long did we wait? Well a table of 7 was seated about 5 minutes after were and they got their food before the two of us! Ridiculous.  Our server came back one time a few minutes after she got our drinks and then she disappeared.    After 25 minutes, I literally had to stand up to get her attention and flat out said 'where's our food?'. She then said 'it's coming'. About 4 minutes later, someone else came to the table with our food.   And about that food: my wife's 'over medium' eggs were cooked solid (over hard), the cheese on her scramble was brown and crispy and my toast was hard as a rock. It was pretty clear to us that for whatever reason our food was sitting under the warmer for a fair amount of time.   Bonus: I ordered a blueberry pancake to go and ate it today (the next day after we were there). Shocking thing: they got that wrong too. They gave me chocolate chip instead of blueberry.   When I went to pay the cashier asked how things were. I told her that the service was incredibly slow. Her response: 'I'm sorry, it's been crazy here with it being Sunday morning'. Well I'm sorry, but you are a restaurant that is only open for breakfast and lunch. How the f do you not know how to deal with being busy?!?!?!? And as I said before, the Fairlawn location is ALWAYS packed with 20-30 people waiting for tables at any given time. Here there was maybe 4 people. That's your definition of busy? I'd hate to the service when it was really busy because this was pathetic.  Bottom line: terribly slow service and definitely not worth the wait especially for food that wasn't close to what we ordered."}
{"text":"Been here several times now that it's open and haven't been disappointed yet. Everything is new and clean obviously, and the staff is very friendly and in fast. The food has also been delicious every time my wife and I have come in. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. Also, the pricing isn't bad for what  you get.   The only con, as with everything in portage Crossing is the parking situation"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Interior nicely updated and food pleasingly plated. Everything on the menu sounds yummy. I ordered the brisket hash, which is 1 of the summer specials. I was disappointed by the large pieces of potato,onions, kale and tough tasteless brisket. Nothing was chopped or resembled hash. Will try again, but maybe order something more basic."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ, this was an awesome place to have breakfast, they have a seasonal menu, service was great and since it was a weekday wait time wasn't bad.   I ordered the special pork belly cheese grits with poached eggs, artisinal  toast, and side salad. Our waiter suggested to change the salad to the potatoes which was a good call. We also ordered a cinnamon waffle to share...    Everything was good, the grits with the pork belly and egg was Yum! Perfectly poached and seasoned, the potatoes was on point. The Cinnamon waffle wasn't overly sweet, it wasn't drenched in cinnamon syrup which is good, they gave us a cute little container of it on the side to add more if we like.   The waiter checked on us often and they were cool about us sitting there chatting way after our meal was done. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went for first time since re opening. First thing noticed was very nice decor. Then that they had new menu with higher prices. We ordered biscuits & gravy, and avocado toast, which we have had many times there in the past. All of it was barely edible, nothing like before. We were very disappointed and will. Not be going back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to First Watch this morning for breakfast and we had a wonderful dining experience, because of our server, Karissa! What a gem and rare customer service she provides her customers. She waited on us promptly, our food was warm, she was thorough in asking us what we wanted, checked in with us several times to see how every thing was and if we needed any thing, refilled my ice tea without my asking, offered to give us drink refills to take with us, and thanked us for coming in this morning. I thanked her for taking good care of us and Karissa said she looked forward to seeing us next time. I would highly recommend First Watch on Alma School in Chandler and ask for Karissa's section!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the waiting time it was about 20 to 30 minutes to be on a table on the restaurant so i decide to order to go a simple half sandwich and a half salad they lasted more than 1 hour to give me my order and when i got home the order was wrong!!! Not happy with the service, wont ever go again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place when I want to sit down to breakfast. Everything thing I've ordered is awesome but the waffles stick out in my head specifically."}
{"text":"Modern fresh take on good old comfort food. Clean, great service and a very new and enticing breakfast and lunch options. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating breakfast here very humble customer service n good food. Always alot of peeps n only a breakfast joint. Luv it! Fair prices, n pretty good portions."}
{"text":"This is a definite go to place when I'm in the area. The staff were friendly and delightful, responsive to my short time frame. The food was excellent and the Millionaire's bacon was worth the price. Almost too much food to take in and all of it tasty, well-balanced salt and spice. I didn't realize this was one of many in the Valley. The one I ate at, just north of Dunlap was superb. I'll be back"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into the Restaurant we were greeted by the Manager who was very pleasant.  We were seated immediately and had several people attend to our needs.  This has been by far one of the best places we have eaten in a long time.  Not only was everyone there very nice, the food was AMAZING!  You have to try their millionaire bacon.  It's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and good prices. Healthy and delicious choices as well. Will definitely be back when I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"went there today for breakfast, food was just ok eggs cooked wrong, and service was slow. Was much better when it was good egg. Probably will never return"}
{"text":"Best coffee, great breakfast. A little pricey for what you get. Hostesses are a hit or miss - either nice or rude. Waiters are usually attentive."}
{"text":"Just visiting area and yelped where to go for brunch. Yelp steered me right this place was very tasty and healthy!! I has the crepeseggs healthy and tasty daughter had the sourdough pancakes she thought they were perfect."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh food. The bread and strawberry jam are to die for. Highly recommend the Hash....potatoes & eggs cooked to perfection!  Friendly service and a Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Healthy!  Fast service for a Sunday.  Great atmosphere.  I had the avocado toast and eggs."}
{"text":"2/24/2017 Yelp review First Watch Tempe AZ 61 W. Thomas Road Phoenix, AZ 85013  (602) 265-2092  Since the first time I've been to First Watch I've always had good quality food and good service. I ordered the elevated egg sandwich which is served with seasoned potatoes. The bacon, avocado, mayo, and cheese were refreshing to my taste buds. All the ingredients they use are fresh and their eggs are cage-free. I enjoyed the sandwich because I feel good after eating it, it is not heavy and greasy like other places I've been to. Instead the food fills you up in a good way. The eggs were cooked over- easy so when you bite into it the yolk will dress the other ingredients perfectly. The portion of each ingredient is made so with every bite you can enjoy the pairing of egg, bacon, cheese, mayo, and arugula. The seasoned potatoes melt in your mouth because they're so light and soft. I recommend this dish to any sandwich lovers out there!   A group of four of us were seated right away which is perfect for a college student who has a tight schedule and needs something quick they had really helpful service. The pricing is a little pricier than some places but it is worth the few extra dollars. You pay for the fresh ingredients and incredible service. I ordered the elevated egg sandwich which was $9.49. They have a range of drinks to order such as; coffee, tea, soda, and they even have a fresh juice bar. When you first sit down they ask if anyone would like coffee instead of just offering you a cup they provide you with a large pot and even provide you with a bowl of different creams. Other items for breakfast/brunch range from 7.99-10.79. The presentation was appealing to the eye and you can tell the work they put into each dish. The vibrant colors of the food made it look mouth-watering and the seasoned potatoes on the side were a crisp golden brown. I also ordered an appetizer that was a little out of my comfort zone it was an AM superfoods bowl. For a breakfast appetizer, it was a little overpriced in my opinion. It was a little over six dollars. The bowl itself is very pretty and balanced with crunch and sweetness. It looks just like the picture that advertises it on the wooden table.    The atmosphere of First Watch is earthy and friendly. The décor of the restaurant is what give it the earthy tone, it is decorated perfectly with wooden tables and benches on the inside and you can even enjoy your meal outside near Mill Avenue. The plates and silverware are simple and make the food pop. The service at First Watch makes you feel at home and the past few times I've been there I've got nothing but incredible servers.  First Watch is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast/brunch and I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Been twice, and will be back more. Best breakfast in Charlotte. HANDS DOWN! Floridian French Toast and the loaded omelette are fantastic."}
{"text":"The most disappointing experience with A: The manager and B: Their thieving staff. Did everyone know they don't have cameras? How classy and useful! Glad to know that if something terrible, God forbid, ever happens that there will be ZERO justice because first watch thinks it's not a good idea to be safe and have cameras! Left my sunglasses, called back ten minutes later and no one could find them and they were zero help! \"We'll call you right back\" never called. I had to call back each time. I'm so disappointed. I don't think I'll be back for the mediocre service and less than desirable management. Good job, First Watch! A disappointing replacement for a once good restaurant."}
{"text":"We sort of stumbled on this place one day when looking for a joint that serves breakfast and is halfway decent at about 1:30pm one day. We walked in to a totally dead restaurant and were treated to some pretty solid orders of french toast. I decided that this place seemed pretty good, but wanted to come back during more regular breakfast hours to eat a more regular (for me) breakfast.  I came back the next day with my son and ordered a chimichurri chicken skillet and a coffee. My son ordered a kids chocolate chip pancake breakfast and an apple juice. Their kids menus are nice and interactive (with crayons), so he kept busy while we waited for our food. When the food arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised. The pancake looked amazing and was far larger than his head. About halfway through, he remarked that First Watch is now his favorite breakfast place, which is a HUGE deal. This kid is very loyal doesn't change his top 5 list ever, let alone bump his first favorite choice. My skillet was really delicious and the bread is amazing. It's a thick, dense multi grain bread that is super flavorful with great texture.   The service both times I've been here was friendly and fairly prompt. The mark off for the one star is due to the little things. They don't have good prices on sides. If you want real syrup you have to pay extra for it ($1.29). They seem to good everything in an ungodly amount of oil, which is always a turn off for me.   All in all, it's pretty good. I'd recommend giving it a shot if you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"The waiter came pretty fast to take my order and I didn't rehears saying \"I'll have the eggs Benedict\" 15 times in head. But it's cool."}
{"text":"Friendly service with a good selection of healthy options. We dined here for the first time last weekend on a Saturday morning for breakfast, right after they opened, so there were only a few other tables seated. Of note - this is a restaurant chain (with 100 or so locations across the US) which I didn't realize until after we finished eating.  The ambiance was somewhat generic-feeling (but definitely a step up from other chain diners that I am familiar with), but very clean. We were immediately greeted and seated. The waitresses were attentive and friendly. The coffee cups were always hot and full. The menu is large - it provided plenty of options for the healthy, and not so healthy breakfast. We ordered some of both - an egg white omelette and some pumpkin pancakes. Both were very good, fresh, and arrived quickly.  Recap - clean restaurant, friendly service, healthy options, good food, open early for breakfast.  Overall we thought the restaurant was very good, and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"After my last experience I was ready to write First Watch off, however the manager reached out to me to make things right, and we decided to give this restaurant another go.  I am so glad we did!  We ordered 2 Ultimate Breakfast Sandwiches to go, and actually got our eggs runny on both sandwiches!!  Plus, the sizing was back to what it was previously so the portioning was perfect and the person who took our order over the phone was pleasant and helpful.  It was a serious hallelujah moment, because we truly love this sandwich (if you love breakfast sandwiches please give this one a go - bacon, arugula, avocado....what's not to love!)  and missed having it in our morning rotation.  Now we get to bring this back into the fold and we will definitely be coming back for some yummy breakfast sandwich goodness :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on Saturday morning thinking it was the Good Egg, no worries though.  The restaurant was newly renovated, it's beautiful inside. I ordered the trifecta, it's was okay. My significant other ordered the French toast which she loved.  The service was mediocre, the waitress was very slow in coming around to check on us and the portions were a little smaller than I'm used to with breakfast.  All in all it was just ok."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to First Watch in their new digs.  We arrived to a 25-30 min wait, but no worries, we just checked in to No Wait, and bummed around McCandless Crossing. We were seated right on time and greeted promptly. I was impressed by the fresh juice bar, and complimentary coffee in the lobby. I myself ordered the pesto chicken quinoa bowl, and The Legend ordered the Trifecta. We also tried the SOD, Creamy Chicken w/ Wild Rice. Everything was absolutely fantastic! We were impressed with the higher touches the most, like our own carafe of chilled water, personal pot of coffee, and warmed maple syrup for The Legend's Belgian waffle. Service was friendly and efficient, and everyone seemed to work well as a team. We will definitely be back, as here are 20 more things on the menu we'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Love First Watch! I have been here numerous times. Mostly for breakfast but a few times for lunch. Their menu has such a good variety of options. I always have a hard time narrowing it down to just one thing. Love the Eggs Benedict Florentine. The service is always good even though they are always pretty packed. Love the location in Crocker Park. It is fun to breakfast here then head next door to Trader Joe's. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is always packed but the food is okay at best. Eating here reminded me of eating at a Denny's, nothing special about it. I have to say they do have really good service though and I love that they had coffee out in the waiting area. They also keep the coffee pot on each table so you can fill up at your leisure. That is a smart idea!  However, the food here wasn't so great so I don't think I'll be back. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but my friend also wasn't a fan of his food. Very bland and tasteless. It is a bit pricey as well which didn't make sense to me. I also found out they have a few locations which was surprising. They do have a healthy section on the menu which was a plus if you're watching what you eat."}
{"text":"There was definitely a solid 20 mi it's wait when we came on Sunday at 10:50AM... but it was SO worth it! My mom and I came for a hearty grub and as my mom makes good decisions, I regularly copy her and we both got the elevated egg sandwich. It was amazing! The potatoes did not disappoint either. I can't wait to try more on the menu and for the weather to cool off and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Great menu selections, family/casual atmosphere, no issues with parking. Would definitely go back.  While the bacon appetizer was yummy- I would categorize it as a side dish before an appetizer."}
{"text":"I love the changes and the new rustic feel!! Soooo cute!! Reminds me of the good old days! Haha! We had the Salmon Eggs Benedict!! AHHMAZING!! The Avocado chicken Chop Salad YUM! And the Chickichanga!! Soooo good!!! Our server was very nice. Oh! And the breakfast potatoes are to die for! We ordered extra."}
{"text":"O o o , when it comes to breakfast , I feel like everyone has one go to place for breakfast and First Watch claimed my title. Best Breakfast place in Phoenix , I have had the pleasure of being served in.   First thing which everyone must try, the hot chocolate , the best way to start your (in my case) late morning. So good and they give you a decent size mug to enjoy this drink . Now the amount of food you get is enough to cover a few meals in your day which is a big bonus. But the winning prize goes to the flexibility of the menu and the staff. I do not eat pork and if you are the type to want some meat in your omelette its hard to choose something off the menu without pork in it. First watch has plenty of substitute options and they do not count pennies on the ingredients, they stack it up.  I believe I purchased the avocado omelette and a two pancake side. The omelette, I asked if I could sub in some turkey sausage and they delivered . the plate was packed with potato , omelette and English muffin. Now the pancakes, o my was the cherry on top, best pancakes out there. Fluffy , filling and man it actually warms my heart knowing there is someone out there , who took the time to deliver those stacks.   Overall great restaurant , friendly staff , whoever the owners are bravo , open up a First Watch next door to me cause I will be there everyday . also my bill was about 30 dollars for myself and my girlfriend to order breakfast with coffee and 2 hot chocolates so its not over priced and I would of paid more for that meal."}
{"text":"This is a MUST STOP if you are visiting Arizona.  The whole experience was awesome!  Great food, tasty drinks and wonderful customer service!  If you want to try something new and feel great about the food you eat, then this is the place for you and your family! Too bad they are not in San Diego . Definitely coming back everyt time I'm in Chandler, AZ"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was quaint! Ordered biscuit with gravy, potatoes, and sausage. My boyfriend ordered French toast and a maple bacon dish on their summer speciality menu (too sweet for me but he loved it). We also got some super refreshing drink with fresh pressed watermelon and basil (that was amazing). I'll definitely be back and try something else on the menu. Service was also great. Breakfast came up to $35 for the both of us, not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Sunday for the first time. The wait time was insane long but tolerable. But out of the First Watch near us, this location had the shortest wait time.   When we were finally seated, we ordered our beverages and food all at once. Coffee and juice came quick but the food took much longer than it did. Our server(forgot his name) didn't even come by once to see if we needed anything. The reason for the 3 stars. He even forgot the potatoes in my order but that's ok. When our food arrived, he didn't check back to see if there was anything else we needed.   Luckily the food was good. Service could definitely use a lot of work. It would be a shame if the service doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and every time, it is absolutely delicious! I totally recommend this place from the service to the food and the prices aren't bad either. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great option for a healthier breakfast and lunch items. No mimosas or bloody Mary's but the lightly sweetened green tea was perfect. I had the market farmhouse skillet (add bacon*) and it was a very generous serving size. No complaints about the skillet- it was perfect with a fresh side of seasonal fruit, whole grain toast and some sweet jam. I highly suggest it. The service was overall pretty quick. We went around 10 am- there was a 10 minute wait but free coffee while you are waiting. All of the staff was friendly and the seating is very comfortable. I wasn't too fancy about the method for paying at the entrance rather than the waiter taking the check.. reason being the front is rather packed with people waiting to be seated so it's a little tight but the prices are great and so was the food so We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The thing I like the most about this place is their menu. They have fatty stuff for people who like fatty stuff and LOTS of options for people who like healthy stuff. Prices are reasonable, the staff is welcoming extremely accommodating. I've eaten here with a large group, a small group with kids, and just by myself and each time I've received amazing service. Added to my list of favorites :D"}
{"text":"We are regular customers at First Watch here at the Promenade in Scottsdale. It's a pet friendly establishment so it's a no brainer. We usually sit outside on the patio, service is always fast and very friendly. My favorite dish here is the Farmhouse Skillet, it's delicious. The last couple of times I have noticed it's significantly saltier.. not sure why? Perhaps different/ new recipe ? If so, please stop adding this much salt, it's not necessary.   Wanted to thank Allan our server for taking such a great care of us every time."}
{"text":"I received one of the 'buy one entree, get one free' coupons in my mailbox and decided to give this place a try. I was sorely disappointed. Their website and ads boast about 'healthy' choices... when truly, they are not very healthy at all. The lowest calorie plate was 550 calories and comes with sugar jelly and the veggies in the egg white omelet were soaked in oil. Not to mention, the plate looked like something premade, heated, and then tossed on the plate. When we were finished with our meal, before we had walked halfway home, both of our bellies were grumbling and upset. The food did not settle well at all. We will not be visiting a second time."}
{"text":"I pulled this choice out of thin air as I was hungry and ready to consume just about anything available....At first I thought I had stumbled on a locals place with a line waiting to get in...(always a good sign when there is a line). Nice ambiance, comfortable...very friendly staff...and the menu was like...\"whaaaat?\" Healthy food meets comfort food....awesome selection. So come to find out, this is a chain foodery...now I have to go and check out another location just to see if they got the consistency down..."}
{"text":"Best French toast I have ever had. Great selection of food and juices. Their biscuits and gravy was amazing. Service is on par. Their prices are a little high but you get what you pay for and the portions are huge. Very friendly and clean. Definitely a place to try. Also, the hours are only until 2:30. Unfortunately."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday morning to a crowd of people hanging outside. In my opinion a wait time indicates a good place to eat, why would you wait if not? Seating is cozy and the ambience is nice, they also offer outdoor seating. Oj and water tasted fresh, coffee was pleasing. They have Cholula on the table, a good sign.  Food was fantastic, I got the power wrap which I would highly recommend. Their food tastes very homemade. Breakfast is hard to mess up and even harder to reinvent but they certainly did a great job here of bringing something new and exciting to mornings. Next visit I think I'll try something from their juice bar."}
{"text":"Great Brunch spot! The breakfast Chimichanga is what i call a \"Next Entree\"....as soon as you bite into it, you're already thinking about ordering next time you come!  The potatoes are a great addition to this..  Something lighter, go with the Ricotta filled, lemon curd pancakes! Very tasty!   Look forward to trying their lunch next time."}
{"text":"First of all, the service here was amazing. A group of us from a conference (12 people) showed up at lunch, when it was already busy, and we were in and out in less than 1 hour.  Everyone's food was great, except for mine lol. I got a chorizo egg white omelette that arrived 15 minutes later than everyone else's, has no chorizo in it, but did have an entire onion in it. And the egg whites had a weird texture, they were foamy.  But again, cannot stress enough the amazing job the greeter and server did. I wish I remembered their names."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid breakfast or brunch menu, First Watch is the place!!! I visit 3 different locations (Camelback, Thunderbird, Promenade) and the food is consistently delicious at each one.  My go-to is the avocado toast - it's on a thick bread and has EVOO and lemon squeezed on top... drool. They have great pancakes, oatmeal, and I've heard good things about all of their \"eggs-clusive\" items as well. Don't miss the Kale Tonic green juice! For lunch I almost always get the veggie sandwich which I highly recommend.   Overall service is pretty fast, I like how they can turn people in and out quickly. Even if there is a wait it doesn't feel like forever. This place is definitely popular for a reason! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is really clean and friendly. There is something for everyone. The healthy options are plentiful, vegetarians have many things to choose from. They can make anything to order and don't mind making changes to a dish. The Orange juice was truly fresh and the fruit was not from a can.   If you are going to order the pancakes, they say they are big and they are. They are the size of the plate, but really tasty. Prices are very reasonable for the great food you get"}
{"text":"We can't get enough of the place. Their customer service and heathy food is outstanding. My favorite is the Power-foods breakfast and homemade granola. Really everything they make is outstanding! Service really is amazing"}
{"text":"I am the type of person who finds one thing they like and order it every time.  At First Watch, I think I try something different every time and have never been disappointed.  The Sweet Honey Pecan salad, Avocado Toast, Million Dollar Bacon, Belgian Waffle, French Toast are all delicious.  Today I went in thinking I'd have the Lemon Ricotta pancakes again, but at the suggestion of the manager, tried the Elote Mexican Corn Hash.  AWESOME!  I'm thinking about going back tomorrow.  Staff is always pleasant and attentive.  There are a lot of places to eat breakfast around the valley, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Not sure about a few of the negative reviews cause our experience was great. First time here and we had the chickichanga, pot roast hash, and chocolate chip pancakes. Fresh juice to drink. Everything was fresh and quick to serve.  Free coffee while waiting. 20 min wait but on New Years Day with many places closed I expected a wait."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast for pick up and it was easy and seamless. I even substituted the ciabatta for bread with no push back. My order was ready in less than 10 minutes and I had no wait. The seasonal pork belly and cheddar grits were very tasty. My poached eggs were cooked to perfection and the serving size was made than feeling. Highly recommend if you're in the area for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place and the first time at this location.  It's consistent no matter which location I visit. The wait can be long on weekend mornings, but today, I shared breakfast with my wife and a slew of mother groups.  We shared the AVOCADO TOAST and a side of bacon. It was delicious as usual.  We we seated quickly, served right away and attended to very well. I recommend First Watch no matter which location you visit because I always walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here early on Sunday morning.  It was not busy at all and the service was rapid. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. My wife ordered a scramble and I ordered poached eggs on toast. It was amazing with the bacon and greens. The hollandaise sauce was light and blended well with the toast. My wife loved her meal. We will definitely come back since this will be our new \"spot\"."}
{"text":"Quick to sit and order, nice atmosphere with a dog friendly patio! We come at least twice a month to enjoy this location"}
{"text":"Good service even when they are slammed. The food is good quality and fresh. Put your name in early on weekends."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Everyone was really nice. What I got was delicious. There were only a couple things that made this get a 3 star: 1. I found a hair in my food which they remade and took off my total bill, and 2. I ended up getting diarrhea from the food (sorry if that's too much information). If this hadn't happened i would probably go back but because this did... I probably wouldn't go back. My boyfriend got an eggs Benedict and he was happy with it. So it was probably just my meal."}
{"text":"After hearing everyone at my company's Rocky River store rave about First Watch I was super excited to get sent out there today to work.  Had I known my take-out order of Eggs Benedict was going to be an arts-and-crafts project, however, I would have just brought my own lunch from home.    Eggs Benedict is my all time favorite breakfast food.  It's pretty hard to mess up unless you have junky hollandaise sauce.  English Muffin, Canadian Bacon, Poached Egg, Sauce.  Presto, instant yummy! Sure you can dress it up or down, but the basic formula stays the same.    First Watch however managed to mess up even that simple time-tested formula.  You see, when you get it to go, instead of gently poached eggs, they're basically over hard.  Also, everything comes on the side.  So you have to construct your own meal.  Add on top that they forgot the hollandaise all together and that I had to go back to get it equals one horrific Eggs Bene.  I guess I'll be getting food from The Pub or Lake Island Coffee from now on."}
{"text":"Unbelievable breakfast/brunch/lunch place. Food is amazing service is pleasant. Yes it is a chain but they do great work intertwining into the community. The rainbow toast is out of this world, biscuits and Turkey gravy are better than anything I have ever had! #nomnomnom"}
{"text":"FRIENDLY, FAST SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD. NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITE.   --eggs overcooked --oj watery but tasty --food not greasy or oily --everything just a little bit healthier than you'll find elsewhere."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from a family member which they highy praised so i decided to check it out for myself.  The staff and food were amazing.  I order a farm house skillet and i enjoy every last bite of it.  Highly recommend thus restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I think this is a pretty average restaurant. I came in for lunch and was seated promptly. I ordered the turkey club and a cup of clam chowder. The sandwich was good but the clam chowder had no seasoning and no flavor at all. The service was very fast and friendly. Seems like a decent place for lunch, I will just skip the soup next time."}
{"text":"I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but decided to give them 3.   My experience here was acceptable, and I only have one specific complaint - the quality of the coffee - which is horrendous. They do give you a thermal carafe for the table, which is nice - but you probably won't need it. I took a few sips and quickly realized that it was undrinkable. I had to go to Starbucks afterwards to get a decent cup of coffee.   The waffle was OK, nothing special. I did find it to be unusually tough to cut through with the provided butter knife. It almost seemed chewy like marshmallow, but the flavor was definitely fine. Bacon was a bit flimsy, but that definitely beats having it burnt. Eggs were exactly as you'd expect.   Based on the food and coffee quality, they were headed for a solid 2-star rating. However, the quality of the service pushed them over the threshold to 3 stars. I have to say the service was quite good. We were seated immediately (but that could have had something to do with the fact that there were only maybe 3 or 4 occupied tables in the whole place at 7:50 AM - not a good sign), and our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  I'll give it another shot at some point, but I won't be rushing back, as there's plenty of equivalent-quality places right around the corner from here."}
{"text":"My 2nd time eating at first watch both times i had a heart healthy breakfast meal and both were very good simple yet creative meals. Today i had the smashed avocado on toast with two farm fresh eggs small glass of oj. Again simple but well prepared and creative. Thats a good thing. I have been in the restaurant buisness for 38 years 26 of them as an executive Chef. First watch is a winner, clean well trained staff, simple and creative food. I had a very young but well mannered clean young man wait on me. He was respectful fairly knowledgeable about the menu and he seemed to enjoy his job. So many times in all types of restaurants including mine the attitude and presentation of your front line server can make or break your experience. So well done keep up the good work. Your prices are a little on the high side but you do serve quality food so i understand just try to keep the value there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing not even regular amazing, let's just say super amazing. If your looking for a legit breakfast at a very reasonable price this is the place, they also have fresh juice and light breakfast items for athletic people like myself."}
{"text":"Eh...Ok in a pinch but uninspiring menu. Food was not very tasty. I was expecting way more."}
{"text":"Went to First Response yesterday checked in, was told 15 mins,  sat down outside 20 mins went by, very hot, went inside to wait, watched more and more people get seated that arrived after me, I thought maybe cuz more people I wud 2, but then I saw 2 people that had arrived at least 20 mins after me get seated so I spoke up, this was after being there 50 mins! They said I wasn't on the list! And I had even gotten a confirmation text! They seated us right away and apologized and compt the meal. We were there a total of 1 hour 45 mins for breakfast. I get it it was an accident but how do you miss the same people sitting in front of you for that long?? BTW food was good."}
{"text":"We got to First Watch in the Promenade in Scottsdale at 10:30am on a Sunday, so prime time for a breakfast place! They were packed, but handled the crowd efficiently and pleasantly. I tried one of their summer specials, the avocado toast with 2 basted eggs. It was delicious. If you haven't jumped on the avocado toast bandwagon, just google it, or search that term in Pinterest - it's a thing!  Very simple, but has to be well executed. The avocado was very fresh and green and had a nice lemony flavor too. The eggs were basted and were a nice savory accompaniment to the avocado toast.  My friend had The Works omelette and liked it.She made a few substitutions (she's sort of a Meg Ryan that way) and the waitress was very nice about it."}
{"text":"Tried First Watch Carefree Tramonto this AM after eating in their various locations always having a good experience.  Possibly the worst breakfast ever.  My wife's food arrived cold as witnessed by cold full grain toast slathered in butter that never melted, cold eggs and undercooked home fries.  My own breakfast was slightly better although the eggs were under scrambled  (re: runny whites) and cold toast.  Grossly overpriced for the qualtiy, what little of it there was.  Plenty of other good choices around...."}
{"text":"Tasty. Distinctive. Great food, nice atmosphere, quick & friendly service. Visited twice during current vacation. Nice outdoor seating on second trip. Looking forward to our third."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint! Food is tasty and so fresh. Servers are always engaged in serving you and making sure you're content. I've only been there for breakfast but it's so right every time. The tea selection is awesome."}
{"text":"First time at a First Watch restaurant.  Absolutely loved it and will definitely be back.   Had the smoked salmon benedict - in super picky about how poached my eggs are and these were perfect with nice runny yolk.  Everything had great flavor,  appropriate serving size, and upscale feel at reasonable prices. The service is great,  love the modern farmhouse ambiance with open kitchen.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place this is one of the best places around for.breakfast and lunch. The staff is friendly and attentive, the restaurant is clean and sanitary, and the portions are big and the prices is reasonable this combines for a excellent redtaurant. My server made sure i had a superb meal which i did. Definately will be back in future"}
{"text":"First time here. The place is nice and bright. They have a lot of different items that other places do not offer. They provide the calorie content on the items.  The pancakes and tacos were awesome. The staff was helpful. I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Super casual, friendly atmosphere. There were 2 groups meeting there, and they seemed to be properly accommodated. Great food and friendly employees"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch. The melted chicken salad with pan fried potatoes is delicious. The service is exceptional and friendly. Seating inside or out rounds out a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food with plenty of options! Love the seasonal selections they offer to the community as well! Natalie was our server and couldn't have done more of an amazing job! She was excellent, well spoken and very kind! She went over the menu without any problems and answered all questions clear. Natalie definitely made our breakfast experience great here! Will be back! Millionaire bacon is to die for!"}
{"text":"Went back this morning and had the traditional breakfast, which was comped via  Rebecca L. From customer service.   I immediately noticed The sour dough toast had blue mold on the crust besides being untoasted and pointed it out to the server. The bacon was limp and rubbery. The eggs looked ok. Had fruit as a side. Our server was Eli and he was very polite. He immediately took the bread and replaced it with more untoasted sour dough.  Needless to say, I did not eat any of my breakfast. Eli took it off the bill. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food was cold, the waitress was slow, and the customer service was just okay. I came by thinking I was going to eat at the Good Egg stopped by gave it a chance I wish I should've kept going. I will not return, the food is not the same as it was."}
{"text":"We are a family of 5 (including a toddler who we've brought here since he was an infant). We are regulars because of the great food, service and how accommodating they are to families. The million dollar bacon is a family favorite."}
{"text":"With many breakfast/lunch choices in the area, First Watch is nearly perfect. As a single diner, they have a convenient counter for quick service, but even if there is a wait, it never seems to be too long. Friendly & attentive service and quality choices for both the health conscious and those who don't hold back!! Personally, I love the Belgian waffles!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars due to the spectacular service from Jared. Best restaurant server we've had in a long time. Breakfast was unique and good -- as was the needed coffee -- and we'll return if we can."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here all the time when it was a Good Egg. First Watch took over and it is still our favorite breakfast/lunch restaurant. We are glad they kept Alan, he is our favorite manager, one of the nicest guys we have ever met. We also can't forget about our favorite server, Jenny! If Jenny or Alan were ever having a bad day you would never know it. By the way, the food is great too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They are not that new anymore, service is lacking. No communications between servers and host. We came in and told it would be a minute so we sat down. Another couple came in and were seated ahead of us by the host at a very large table. The person that told us it would be a minute saw what happened but said nothing. She then started to clean off one of the smallest tables in the restaurant. We left and went and ate at Snooze. This was the fifth time we were at this location and the last. There have been so many small issues, some having to do with the food, that we will not go back. I sent a similar version of this story to First Watch and they never responded."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast, brunch, lunch at this popular daytime cafe. Healthy food is fresh, seasonal and from local growers (in season.) Everything is great."}
{"text":"We went for Easter brunch and it was lovely! Always love the Avocado Toast here - just amazing. I had the Tri Athlete breakfast and it was also delicious! Highly recommend First Watch!"}
{"text":"First Watch is always a good go-to when I'm out of town (or even in town) because you know the food and service will be good. This location did not disappoint either. The decor and atmosphere was great. The restaurant was pretty busy but luckily we didn't have to wait. Our waiter was also really nice.  My sister and I tried the açaí squeeze spring menu juice and it was delicious! I definitely recommend it for a refreshing drink. My sister got the power bowl with chia seeds, granola, and fruit -- it was so good, I will definitely be getting it next time. I got the traditional (always my go-to) with eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes.  First Watch is always a good choice for breakfast/lunch, and this location is no different."}
{"text":"Its been along time since I've walked out of a restaurant.  Walked in and no one was up front so stood there for at least three minutes before we were seated.  Then sat at our table with no acknowledgement for another 10 minutes.  When you see servers walk out and see you still have menus and no beverages but still ignore you, it is time to take your business somewhere else.  Now we are at IHOP!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty simple but excellent quality and very tasty. I have been here once and I ordered the healthy turkey which was an egg white omelette with turkey n veggies, although I make this at home all the time I could definitely tell that I was receiving a high quality and very fresh dish. On the side I added a pancake and wow that's where they really got me. The pancake is multigrain but it taste delicious and not too \"healthy\" like some multigrain items, also add chocolate chips for an extra treat ;)"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! Kind of out of the way from the city but definitely a must if you live in or are visiting Pittsburgh! Lots of healthy options but full of flavor! I got the carrot cake pancakes and the power bowl. Both were excellent! If I come back here I'll definitely make another stop in!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both experiences were incredibly positive.   The food is delicious! I'm a pancake snob and their multigrain blueberry pancakes hit the spot. . Their biscuits with turkey sausage gravy were fluffy and filling. My eggs were cooked exactly how I ordered them. Yum!  Bonus~ they have fresh juices. Their blends (especially Day Glow and Kale Tonic) are tasty.  Another highlight of our visit were the servers. Both servers were cheerful, helpful with the menu and recommendations, and we're just the right amount of attentive.  The next time we're in the area we're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, but extremely overpriced. Three of us went for breakfast. We didn't even order much because everything is so expensive. The bill came to $52! It's breakfast people, and not a large one either! Please come back Good Egg, or else we will be sticking with Danny's and IHOP, where you get good food that doesn't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Price is very reasonable and the selection is very good. The seating is very comfortable. Enjoy First Watch every time I have been there. My new spot. Seems like everything is $10 and under. Always looking to my next visit."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy dish was tasty, but very SALTY.  Not my usual choice but menu has few traditional breakfasts so couldn't find what I really wanted. Prefer water with ice rather than the carafe of lukewarm water served."}
{"text":"Every chance I get to eat here, I do.  I wish there was one in Tucson.  I order the same thing everytime.  I love the Killer Cajun."}
{"text":"I want to amend my previous review. I have since been back and I must say the food and the service us vastly improved. Kudos to the management and the staff for a better dining experience.  Our meal was back to abide part, service was fast and efficient.  Not to long of a wait for a Sunday.  Very pleased."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!!! The staff is great. The food is fresh and consistent. It's is a great place for vegetarian options. I have rarely had a wait, even during the lunch rush. Menu changes regularly and the smoothies are healthy and wonderful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my family or on a date with my husband. Several things I like:  1. They are kid friendly.  2. They send \"buy one get one free\" coupons pretty regularly if you sign up for their emails. 3. They put how many calories are in each dish. 4. They usually have both a basic menu and a seasonal menu so you can try new things. 5. Their fresh squeezed juices are amazing! 6. They have healthy options 7. Everything I've tried has been delicious!  My only complaints are as follows: 1. They usually have a pretty long wait. 2. They over-salt the food. (So I just ask for less salt now). 3. It's hit or miss with the servers."}
{"text":"Very tasty lemon ricotta pancakes, and the kaletonic is delish as well. Definitely will be back if in Phoenix again"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and enjoy the food, but the service has been horrendous. The last two times I came it was hard to even get a refill. Today the server never brought me my side of soup, she neglected to tell me the soup of the day ran out until I had to ask after my food was dropped  off and I flagged her down. She seemed very annoyed that I asked, which I found odd considering my sandwhich came to the table without a side. I'd like to think it'd be normal to inform your customer the soup ran out pick something else.    ......   Decided to give first watch another try and l'm glad that I did!! Although very busy, the service and food were both excellent. I must have been there on an off day last time. I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast dish. Two eggs up, Belgium waffle and one sausage link. Meal was OK. Nothing impressive. Certainly over priced compared to other breakfast venues. Would not return unless nothing else is close by."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to First Watch and I would say overall it was a good experience and would go there again for breakfast.    The Wait: I went on a Friday at about 9-10 am and we waited about 15 mins to be seated. The waiting area had plenty of room with benches and had some comfortable lounge chairs. They had complimentary coffee available, which adds a nice touch.  By the time we left around 10:30am the wait was probably closer to 30-45 mins.  I would highly recommend downloading the NoWait app and check-in before you get there. There were people who got seated before us and showed up after us that used that app to check-in.   Service: No complaints about the staff. Didn't bother you but made sure you were happy. The food wait time was average for a breakfast/ lunch joint (5-10 mins after ordering)   Food and Beverage: The coffee was average at best, but the food made up for the sub par coffee. I got the Breakfast Scrambler which was excellent. The one thing I noticed about this place compared to other breakfast places is that everything seemed a little extra healthy. The eggs and potatoes were not dripping in butter and oil. There was fruit cup as a side with just about everything. Even the ketchup they served was non- high fructose corn syrup.   Portion Size: I have no complaints about the portion sizes because I was full when I left and ate everything. As a comparison to other diners and restaurants, the portion size is far below average; but who eats left over breakfast food...  Price: 2 people is probably going to almost always be around $25; food, drink and tip. Things are slightly on the higher end for breakfast food but I would say that the quality of the food I worth the slightly inflated price.   Accessibility: This First Watch is in Crocker Park so you will have to park in a parking garage and walk some. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready so you can stroll around Crocker if the wait is long (which it almost always is during the weekend). Like I mentioned before, get the NoWait app and check-in through that and save lots of time.   Cleanliness: Our table was clean and not sticky. We did not smell like we just walked out of a diner when we left. Overall a well kept restaurant.   Summary: High quality food, good service, below average parking accessibility, and reasonably priced for the quality of food.   I recommend this restaurant to you and I will be going again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for years and bringing our kids the majority if the time.  Super fast service, healthy food and the wait staff as it has changed has never hired someone we did not like!  Te good is always great and tasty, the restaurant is always super well lit as a breakfast place should be, and out good has always been reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"This was a really yummy breakfast. I had the steel cut oatmeal and wow, it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little brunch spot at Crocker Park! They recently updated the decor and it's so rustic and adorable. The food is fresh and delicious. Love the omelettes! Service is quick and friendly. They're only open until 2:30, so they focus only on brunch/breakfast."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about this place from numerous different people so I was very excited I finally got to try it. I really liked the amount of options they had and also the fact that the options all looked very good. Most of the options were very healthy which was nice. Everything was reasonably priced and the portions were nice sized. While there was definitely nothing wrong with my experience, the food, or the service I just wasn't in awe. It felt a lot like a upgraded eat n park establishment. While I love that occasionally, there are so many amazing options in this food city so in comparison to everything else it just fell short of my expectations. I will definitely return again and give some other entrees a try."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast. The vibe of the restaurant is great too. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, lots of options. May be a bit overpriced. The service at this location could definitely be better. Went in with friends from out of state and I was embarassed by the service. After waiting patiently on our male waiter we had to ask for things from another waiter or twice from our own or even get it ourselves. I will also mention, there wasnt alot of people eating there at the time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with lots of healthy options I had the pear cider and it was delicious. The staff was friendly and prompt. The decor was clean and farm themed. If I lived here this would be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Companion and I returned to the same First Watch along with several others for brunch. This time our experience with service was far better. We had a waitress in training and a fully trained waitress. Our bottomless coffee pot was refilled without asking, and service was quick without being obtrusive. Food quality was still the same excellent taste and textures, and muffins were still outstanding. Based on the increased quality of service, I am raising my rating to 4 stars from the previous 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for brunch. It's cute inside and doesn't feel cramped. The service was kind, we were seated quickly. The freshly squeezed orange juice is amazing and so was my eggs Benedict. I took off one star because my husbands country fried steak wasn't the best but overall we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this spot everything came in a timely manner the staff is very kind and knowledgeable about the food. Love how fresh the food is everything comes locally"}
{"text":"What a great re-do of the former Good Egg! The omelettes were perfectly prepared and piping hot, when served.  Ingredients tasted fresh and unlike many breakfast places, nothing was heavy or greasy.  The  server was upbeat and efficient.  Hope, the manager and cashier, clearly loves her job and wants patrons to be happy.  We were happy with the service, quality and also the cleanliness of First Watch.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Today's service was less than stellar. Lately the service has been lacking. Otherwise, the food has always been on point."}
{"text":"Love love  love!!!!! One of my favorite places. I mostly go for breakfast. Green drink with some serious avocado toast is really good. If your having a cheat day defiantly indulge in the pancakes"}
{"text":"Yummy local food with great service and nice atmosphere! We got the salmon omelet and you pick two salad and half sandwich. Quick also."}
{"text":"I think the food would have been pretty good if it wasn't served cold. The decor and atmosphere was nice and clean and modern. But in the end, it all comes down to the food. And the food was just OK"}
{"text":"The service and decor were nice. I had the eggs Florentine and it was good, very fresh, not overly salty or overly seasoned. However, I was disappointed in the weak/flavorless coffee and the overly sweet kids pancakes and syrupy hot chocolate. The prices were on the high side so it's not a place I would return to unless I were nearby. Though I am curious to try the lemon ricotta pancakes."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This place is by a bunch of businesses, so there are a lot of people that go here for lunch. It can get pretty busy!   Service: The employees are friendly. There was only one day when they were a bit backed up, because they were down two employees - but they didn't seem too frantic.  Food & Drinks: The food tastes fresh, and I don't feel guilty after eating. Everything is healthy and delicious. I pretty much ordered the same thing on every visit - a turkey burger and soup. It was all delicious every time I ordered it. It was nice that I got great food every time. It was consistent. My co-workers were so much more healthier than me. The whole reason we went to this place was for their Kale Tonics, which is a refreshing beverage (if you like that kind of stuff). Lol. I'm not much of a kale person, but everyone else enjoyed it. They have a nice \"pick two\" for lunch with your two choices of soup, salad, or sandwich."}
{"text":"It was great. The avocado trash was so fresh! They are the best breakfast place for miles around including that I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! Great place for brunch! The restaurant has this rustic feel to it and gives it a cozy feeling. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was good, but the atmosphere was terrible. It was so loud and noisy with dishes clanging and everybody having to yell to hear each other that made it so noisy we felt like we were at a school cafeteria. The decor needs some soft material or something to help absorb all of the sound!!!"}
{"text":"Every single time I come here I leave full and satisfied. Love the chicken changa on their breakfast menu so delicious. Last time I went I ordered their chicken Palermo on their lunch menu it was yummy and the tomato basil soup that comes with was tasty too. My only complaint is and have said this in the past, is the size of the muffins. They are so good but really expensive for the size so I never order them anymore. Until they make them cheaper or more like the size of Mimi's Cafe muffins I'll pass. However this place will remain a staple as one of my go to breakfast/brunch places. Oh and if you are going to order pancakes just be warned they are huge."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out!!! Today was my third visit to this First Watch.  Every single time I eat here, I always seem to have an issue of some form or another.  Today for lunch I ordered a Veggie Burger w/side of greens, and a \"Root Down\" juice.  The juice arrived promptly, and it was pretty good.  Much better that the last juice I tried here.  It took a little while, but my burger finally arrived.  I started eating it without really paying too much attention, and I remember myself thinking this tastes more like a fowl meat of some sort, more than veggies (but sometimes veggie burgers are like that).  I will admit, it was a fairly tasty burger.  Also, I noticed that my salad had a huge piece of rotten radicchio core hidden under the greens.  There were also a few greens that should have been called browns or blacks (not the freshest spring mix I have ever seen).  After eating I went up to the register to pay, and then I noticed I was rung up, not for a Veggie Burger, but for a Baja Turkey Burger . . . AH HA . . . no wonder it tasted like meat.  Luckily, I am not a strict vegetarian, but still, I kind'a felt violated, because I don't eat meat on Fridays.  I am sorry First Watch, but this is your third strike, and you are now out of my rotation, which is a darn shame, as this place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the one in Bridgeville.  I have never had any problems here, and this was my third or fourth time at this location since it opened.  I took my mother here for brunch today (her first time here), and she had the Belgian Waffle with a side of berry compote, and I had the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes w/strawberries on top, and a side of potatoes.   Everything was good, except they tried to charge us twice for coffee.  They only brought out one pot, but there were two coffees on the bill, but it was corrected at the register after I mentioned it.  Service was very good, and unlike the Bridgeville location, where I always seem to have some negative issue arise with the food, today's meal had no problems with the quality or quantity.  I asked mom if she would ever like to come back, and she said yes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit First Watch on Ray Rd on Saturday the 21st.  We arrived about 8:00AM and the restaurant was not full yet.  We were sat right next to the kitchen - not a great spot.  High traffic area.  I ordered the Avocado Toast.  It was decent - my complaint is the avocado was cold, as if they made a big batch of 'smashed' avocado and stored it in the fridge, it was starting to turn a little brown as avocados do when they are prepared in advance and not stored properly. My boyfriend ordered one of the skillets and he seemed to enjoy it.  He asked our server if they had cinnamon rolls or caramel rolls on the menu - she snarked back \"that would be just the opposite of what we are trying to do\"  all she had to say was \"No sir, we do not\".  At the end of our meal they started to rush us.  We were having a nice conversation and one of the servers came and actually picked up my boyfriends plate and he had to tell her she was not finished yet.   Not 5 minutes later another server came by and tried to take my plate...while I was still eating!   I was going to talk to the manager about this as we paid.  I tried to get his attention but he would not make eye contact.    I do not think we will be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Good food, service was slow and terrible. They lost my reservations (but they did get us seated when I check-in) and it took over an hour to get out food! Not sure if they were short or just way too busy, but not sure I'm going back especially if I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Had the chia bowl which was absolutely fabulous! Love the patio. Menu has a large variety"}
{"text":"My first time at First Watch here at 32nd St and Camelback.  Wow, what have I been missing?    Started off with a welcome greeting and a smile from the young lady at the hostess stand.  Our server was awesome!  His name is Erick.  He helped us with some great recommendations and was super nice and genuine.    Now to breakfast.  I'm a pretty simple guy, so I went with the tried and true Trifecta.  Eggs, bacon, and a banana granola large pancake.  All of it was delish.  Couldn't finish it so taking some home to snack on later in the day.  Will definitely come back and recommend.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, brunch, and lunch! Super chill location with very friendly staff. Free wifi and good coffee make this an ideal spot to camp out and do homework too.  Highly recommend the chickichanga and the elevated egg sandwich! Both are amazing, but I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  Also if you're a fan freshly pressed juices, they have them!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30...only a 5-10 minute wait. They have a convenient text messaging system/app that lets you know how many parties are ahead of you so you can walk around Crocker Park while you're waiting. The food was great, and they have some fresh juices as well, and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their new seasonal menu! The Million Dollar Bacon is the best bacon I've ever had in my life! I would go back just to have bacon and the Kale Tonic which should make for a good hangover cure I'm sure. The Elote Hash was also amazing and the tortillas tasted homemade which is always a nice surprise when a restaurant has homemade tortillas. Avocado toast seem to be popular and did not disappoint. I definitely recommend coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in town. Hands down the best potatoes ever!"}
{"text":"Refreshing to find this breakfast spot in the west valley, not too far from our small business... The food was creative and refreshing, offering the classics and more current offerings. Absolutely everything we had was spot on, and the service was great!!!    We will be back, I have a feeling this will becone a regular breakfast spot for us, rather than driving 45 minutes to  central or east Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a very wonderful cafe to eat at in Ohio. They have a lots of healthy options to eat and also some unique dishes. Loved it completely. I had Acapulco omelette and it was delish."}
{"text":"I like this place, the atmosphere is great for the area but even better it is never busy during the week for breakfast and I enjoy having good breakfast, coffee, and a newspaper.  I love the regular order of bacon and eggs, the bacon is cooked well but not burned, the eggs are EXACTLY as I ordered them, the bread is perfectly toasted.  They only have country potatoes which I prefer hash browns but not a deal breaker for me.  My alternatives in the area are Denny's (atmosphere really sucks) or Mimi's (which is very good but can't eat every day).  I have to say that I am a fan of this place and feel that it is my secret little breakfast hang out."}
{"text":"A bit bland, long waits. Decent healthy options and price. Overall, I've just had way better breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and finally got to try the French toast! So worth the wait! The pieces of French toast were huge and I got the fresh fruit on top. Delicious. Their turkey sausage is better than any sausage I have ever had. Also, they have a new summer fresh juice that is fruit based rather than vegetable. In my last review I stated how I would love an all fruit juice, they listened! Love that.  Yes, it is pricey. $40 dollars for breakfast is a little over the top, but I promise you will not be disappointed in anything you have there. Splurge and go enjoy!"}
{"text":"A wonderful choice for breakfast. Love the menu and the atmosphere. Service was good.  Planning to come back to try lunch. Tried the kale tonic and it was fabulous.  We returnef to First watch to try your lunch out. So glad we did. It was so yummy. My new favorite is the beef sandwich with that special toast they have. My friend had to chop salad and she really enjoyed that also. Will be back again for lunch"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best breakfast/ brunch spot in the East Valley. My wife and I love to go relax and enjoy the natural cooking. The service is always great"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy choices, menu options are varied and have both traditional and non-traditional items, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I went to one in robinson and the food was excellent. The waitresses were very polite. She kept checking on us and was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Amazing menu! Food was incredible! Tatum was a FABULOUS server! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great service and healthy food. I had breakfast here this morning with my friend Sage   The restaurant itself is clean, cheery, and bright.  There is plenty of seating for those waiting to get in, and the service is fast. Our server Jaime made sure that our beverages were filled and that everything was okay. That extra attention is very much appreciated.   The menu is a typical breakfast, brunch and lunch food.  Omelets, soups, creative salads and sandwiches.  Sage had the healthy turkey omellette and I ordered the omelette with avocado and hot tea. There's a lot of healthy options and portions are the perfect size.  Another thing is they have free WI-FI.  Why bother going to a coffee house right?"}
{"text":"My last two breakfasts here I have ordered the 'Healthy Turkey' .... which is an egg white omelette with diced turkey, spinach, feta cheese, diced onions and tomatoes. It is served with an english muffin and is very tasty! ... My husband continues to order his standard raisin french toast smothered in butter and warm blueberry sauce .... with two eggs over easy on the side .... and is still loving it! : ) The coffee is also consistently good and is kept topped up by the great wait staff."}
{"text":"Service was great but the prices and food quality couldn't save this place for me.  The food was okay but it's breakfast not rocket science so I want expecting to drop 20.00 on breakfast for one. I had coffee with a waffle, eggs and sausage and added a side of potatoes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat but the service kinda sucks and the food can be hit or miss some days it's fresh and amazing other days it can be day and cold. Usually very busy! So plan on going EARLY! Especially if you have plans for the day! Overall 3 out of 5 on an iffy day 5/5 on a good day! Def give it a try!"}
{"text":"Was blown away by this adorable little place. We went for breakfast and it was packed ! I could completely see why after we finished. They have such a unique menu with an option for all. I had one of their specialized pancake stacks and it was incredible. Very large portions with the pancakes so order light. Their juice was phenomenal as well I had a special one with beet juice and kale ! Highly recommend and get the app to place a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month for the healthy but delicious breakfast and lunch options. The service is always amazing going above and beyond to get the food out in a timely manner even when it's packed. Get the Kale tonic juice, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service but much too expensive for a weekday or regular gig.  Breakfast plate plus coffee and juice came to $20 per person with tip..."}
{"text":"Great food!  The eggs were cooked perfect.  The bacon is thick and tasty. The portions are plenty big, but not overwhelming.  I really like their new decor.  Loved the service too!"}
{"text":"We thought we would try this for the first time. Liked the decor. The restaurant was not busy being a day after a holiday. Ordered our food and for it not being busy, the food took a long time to come out. When our food finally arrived, my eggs were lukewarm, the potatoes were in my opinion, undercooked, my wife's eggs and bacon were also cold. About the only good thing was the coffee but then again, the coffee was not hot the way coffee should be. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots.  Their fancy pants pancake is the BEST pancake in town.  Very filling... so share it with someone.   Great coffee and egg omelettes too."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 5 times never had to wait too long to be seated. This is definitely a place where you get more then you pay for. Their food is always fresh as well as their fruit. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch the servers here are always friendly and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Had a tasty frittata and wonderful conversation with my mother and nephew.  The waitstaff was so pleasant and helpful.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's been about 4 years since I initially raved about this location and this is the first time in probably 1-2 years since I last visited. While the food was close to what I remembered, the service was mediocre at best.  I was trying to remember just why I stopped going, I know a big part was that I found a place I liked even better, but on looking back I realized that I went looking elsewhere because the service gradually went down. I had  bonded with a couple of wait staff who eventually left and it was kind of never the same, so I left, too.  Which brings me to today. The morning started out well enough with a waitress who promptly took my order with a smile. But then my order was brought by someone else...I asked for salsa and watched as that waitress went into the kitchen and...started...talking...to...other employees. So I waited... and waited...and watched as she continued to talk with a couple of people who seemed to be more hanging around than working. I finally resigned  myself to using the hot sauce on the table. Now, I want to be fair here, I was alone and when you are the only one at the table the food goes fast. I was 3/4 done with my meal when the original waitress came by to see 'how my food was tasting'. Told her the meal itself was fine but she should know about the salsa incident. She then cryptically said she would find out who it was and left. A few moments later the other waitress came by and apologized for forgetting and wanted to know if I still wanted the salsa without looking at the now empty except for the muffin plate. No thanks.  So, is that enough to spur me to knock down my initial review? Shouldn't be except for one other minor point. We're in the desert with record heat this week and my water glass was never refilled, no one came by and even offered, in fact the check just kind of showed up at the table. Again, the restaurant was busy enough that this could have been an oversight but employees were standing around. In fact, when I went to pay the check, the Manager was hanging out with two of the waitstaff up front and the little bit of conversation I heard didn't sound work related to me.  It is so very rare that I skip out on the tip, but my feeling is that when the bill is almost twelve bucks, I could at least be offered a second glass of water. Tipping is a reflection of the service rendered and I wasn't feeliing to good about that service by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Fresh options definitely recommend this place!! Decent prices way better than Dennys or I hop!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"i only gave it four stars because I've only ate here once. the pancakes were very good. so moist that syrup is just optional."}
{"text":"You would think that a breakfast joint could cook an egg. I ordered the traditional breakfast with two over-medium eggs. When it arrived, the eggs were severely undercooked-  I know this because the white in the middle of the egg was still clear, indicating the egg is actually raw. I sent it back, no worries- the waiter was very nice and apologetic. The dish comes back to me, the eggs are so overcooked on the outside they they are uncuttable with a knife, and again- raw, clear, running white on the inside. I ate some of the bacon but had pretty much lost my appetite and ran out of time at this point. If you are a restaurant specializing in breakfast- I would advise you to hire cooks that know how to make an egg- at least a cooked egg."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been here many times.  Food is consistent and good!  Service...not so much.  See, they get really busy here and things escape them!  It seems to depend upon the server you get as to how decent your experience is!  One thing I noted though, that NEEDS TO BE CHANGED:  on an extremely busy Sunday, the hostess seated a SINGLE person at a booth for 6-8 people!  When I asked her WHY she did that (I was a long-time restaurant manager), her reply was, \"Well, I have to take people in order....and the parties of 6-8 will just have to wait\". !!!!! Really???  Not a smart seating policy!  Instead of having dozens of people waiting at the cramped area in front of the hostess stand, SEAT THE LARGEST PARTIES AS SOON AS SPACE BECOMES AVAILABLE!  i watched many folks walk out in frustration.  Train your employees First Watch!  Your product is good, but they are flummoxed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch. The client had picked the restaurant and I was unaware that it is a 100 plus unit chain. Don't know your feelings on chains but please don't rule out this place based on it being a chain because the vibe, decor and food feel very un-chain.  The vibe and service is very friendly here and the service was very professional. The decor is warm and inviting and the food was very fresh.  Ordered the \"2 For You\" which is two of either 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup and 1/2 Salad. I went sandwich and soup. The entree was a very reasonable $7.99. I also ordered coffee and they bring you a pot which I appreciated.   My sandwich was the Roast Beef and Havarti and my soup was Italian Wedding. The sandwich was Roast Beef, Horseradish Havarti, house-roasted onions and tomato with lemon dressed arugula on grilled Parmesan-crusted sourdough, it came with a  Horseradish sauce on the side. The bread was out of this world. The sourdough was tender and the crusted Parmesan was just the right amount of nutty and robust. The Roast Beef was ample and the Horseradish Havarti and Horseradish Sauce  brought a little spice but the tomato, onion and arugula were very muted. The wonderful bread really made the sandwich.  The soup was a nice surprise. The meatball and garlic flavor really came to the front and it was very comforting on a very rainy day.  The service was excellent and while I was wrapping up my meeting we lost track of time and the restaurant had closed. We apologized for any inconvenience and the server was very gracious and told us to take our time and sent us on our way with to go cups of coffee and iced tea. SUPER IMPRESSED!!  10 stars for the service, 9.5 stars for the bread. I guess 5 will have to do."}
{"text":"As a friend and I were driving by and a little hungry I remembered seeing this spot, so giving it a try seemed only logical. We got in quickly since it was after 10am and there were tables available. Service was fast and our waitress came back regularly until we had finished looking over the menu and making our choice. I had the Biscuit and Gravy and my friend had the Pumpkin Pancake with 2 eggs. I enjoyed the Turkey Gravy ( I would have enjoyed more.). The Eggs were perfect and I loved the Home Fries. My friends pancake was wonderful. It's what I will get next time. They give you lots of syrup which is very important. A young lady near us had the Avocado Toast. It looked fantastic. I'll have that in the future also since I plan on coming here often. I will be honest and tell you that the prices are a little higher than I would have expected for what you get. The pancake was large, but they should give you 2 for what it costs.  They do have some unique creations to enjoy, so give them a try."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the waitress.  Sat down and ordered a drink from the waitress.  Choose the breakfast I was planning on getting after a minute.  Waited for the waitress to come back and ask what I wanted, but she would just walk past by my table.  She did this 3 more times.  After 15 minutes of waiting, she finally asked me what I wanted.  Told her I just wanted my check because the wait time to place a meal was unacceptable.  Paid my tab, and told the cashiers I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so obviously I had to try them at First Watch. I loved that it wasn't a huge portion and that it was made with turkey sausage. It was delicious, the perfect amount of food, came with two eggs and I subbed the potatoes for fruit. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good morning Gilbert! I don't usually write reviews but my sandwich was so good I had to share. I had the Market Veggie sandwich and I haven't had a sandwich this satisfying in a very long time. We couldn't get over how scrumptious the bread is, the dressing on the greens is yummy, and the pesto is perfect. I won't be going to needers any time soon, First Watch is so much better. We ordered delivery; it was fast and the food was still hot. Major bonus points for the biodegradable clamshells and not using styrofoam. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is always really good and the employees are always friendly and attentive even when they're busy. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Where do I start...came here for breakfast because my boyfriend and I were fans of the Good Egg. 1st off there were open tables outside and they would not seat us right away. We were finally at a table and then waited again for a server. We ordered finally and our food comes out, everything is cold. My eggs were cold and had a curly red hair in them. To top it off I go to pour myself a glass of water and there is stuff floating in the water bottle they serve the water in (looked like crumbs). Need less to say I will not be returning here. I never had these problems with good egg so I do not know what happened. First watch can go home and give us our breakfast spot back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, 1/2 inch thick dense grain bread on this Avocado toast drizzled with EVOO & lemon.  Warm, farm style kitchen type of atmosphere.  Kids love their choc chip pancakes.  Only 4 Stars bc NO LATTES or ESPRESSO & the coffee was kinda bitter, however served in a carafe to keep it hot."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast and lunch place! The kids enjoyed chocolate chip pancakes and the grown ups liked the omlets. The service is okay but the ambiance and food is great!"}
{"text":"I am so pleased that First Watch had taken over the good egg change and with the changes they have made to the menu and atmosphere. The iced coffee was amazing and the farmhouse hash was delicious. My boyfriend got the pancakes and really enjoyed them. Great service and I had leftovers for days! I really enjoy this place for a low key breakfast"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast! My husband and I found this place visiting from California for a soccer  tournament. Now it's our go to place every time we come back to visit. A.M Superfoods bowl is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow Wow! First Watch on steroids! Always been a fan, but this is really upscale breakfast! The Avocado Toast is must! Great location, as this area has been \"starving\" for a good breakfast place for awhile. Get there soon, because when the word gets out it will be packed!"}
{"text":"I would have given this a 5 star a week ago when I first came to First Watch.  I ordered the Avocado Toast.  It was delicious.  The food was presentable.  The avocados looked like they were cut fresh and stacked high on crunchy toast bread.  It was so delicious, and our server then was very nice.    Today, I came back with friends and I was raving about the Avocado Toast.  I was so disappointed and embarrassed.  The avocados were not freshly prepared.  There were mushed and they were spread out on the bread instead of stacked.  The bread was soggy in the bottom.  Super disappointed.  We had a different server who took so long to take our orders and it looked like she was not happy.  Barely a smile in her face.  Too bad because I like the atmosphere.  I like what they've done to the place.  I don't know if I want to eat here again."}
{"text":"First Watch has become one of my favorite breakfast spots. We usually go to a different location, and this is our first time to this specific store. Service was great and friendly. The food was tasty. Best part is that they have frufru coffee creamers!  They are really good at customizing your order. Definitely come in, and don't forget to try or take one of their fresh squeezed juice concoctions with you."}
{"text":"I've been to another First Watch location that I really was not a fan of.  This location changed my mind.  Met my parents here for a late lunch. We just missed the lunch crowd and we seated right away.  My mother likes privacy so she asked if we could sit far back in the restaurant; they were very kind and seated us in the back.    Being on a new diet, I wanted to see if I can do some protein style breakfast/lunch that wasn't too bad.  I couldn't believe all the choices I had to order from.  I got a chorizo/avocado omelette that was just outstanding.  Both my parents love their food and to top it off, we had a great server!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Added my name to the waitlist on Yelp and was seated immediately upon arrival. The food was excellent! Will return when in the area again."}
{"text":"Sigh.. slow ...slow service , not my first disappointing experience here at this location. Last time service was very slow, but was a very busy day, so didn't write a review. This time we went on this last Sunday morning around 9ish. Our waiter didn't come around at all for almost 10 minutes. Got coffee, then still didn't get water, so had to ask, took 20 minutes of sitting  there with coffee to finally get water. Food must have been sitting on the warmers for a long while because my biscuits and gravy were cold  so really I think it was the service this time that made the experience really bad. Now if my food had still been hot it would have been much better. I definitely should have told the waiter, but who knows when I would have gotten my food at that point, disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Great service and great food! Especially love the A.M. Superfoods Bowl!! So delicious! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had a brouleed bananas on Belgium waffle with bacon and it certainly was interesting. I will have to come here a couple more times to really give it a fair shake. Service was excellent and it was clean and bright."}
{"text":"I have to say it's definitely not the same and odd to have a salad with breakfast and they do not offer buttermilk pancakes that was awesome to have when it was good egg. So overall disappointed and wish they kept some of the good egg items."}
{"text":"Dead pigs galore and no one is complaining! The signature dish is \"Millionaire's Bacon\" brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup. Pork belly with cheesy grits gets rave reviews, as well. I am partial to their skillet dishes. They are bursting with things that don't go \"oink\" like crimini mushrooms, zucchini, potatoes, herb goat cheese all topped with an egg. Their hot chocolate is the whipped cream finisher that brings it all together. Yes m! This is the place for breakfast in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness the food was good, but unfortunately the portions were small and we left hungry. We were told the wait was around 30 minutes but it took almost an hour. The baffling part was that during our entire wait there was always consistently at least 5 open tables that were not being turned quickly at all, making for such a poor customer experience making a huge waiting room of people crammed together to wait, when if they had things organized they wouldn't have empty tables sitting for almost 15 minutes before they were cleaned and seated. Once we got seated, it took almost 10 minutes for someone to come greet us. We immediately put in our food order so we didn't have to keep waiting. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and it was delicious, but again, small portions. Server was very friendly and she offered us a cup of iced tea to go. When you're done eating you have to go wait AGAIN for a third time to pay for your check. Very inefficient management going on here, and not due to lack of employees. They were everywhere, but none of them seemed to be in a hurry or apologetic about any of the waits. Not sure if we'll be back baesd on this."}
{"text":"We had been moving all weekend and wanted a sit down breakfast on the way back to our old aparment to get more stuff... Came here on a whim as we knew it would be fast and hoped it would be good.. we were plesantly suprised. My fiance got the pancake breakfast and this pancake needed its own zip code it was so big.. She enjoyed about half of it as it was so large. I got the traditional breakfast.. The eggs were cooked well and my only complaint was one of the sausage links came out a bit crispier then i tend to enjoy. Our waiter was great and checked on us a few times during our meal(i find this attribute hard to come by in less expensive places more and more)... We are brunchers so i cant promise i will be back soon, but in a need of a quick breakfast we will think of this place again!"}
{"text":"Great menu! I feel their serving size has decreased since the switch over, which is a bit disappointing because that was one reason I really loved this place. The service has always been great. Super friendly servers. Food is yummy!"}
{"text":"Really a good place to do breakfast the million dollar beacon was so darn good and the lemon pancakes where also good. I'm so happy I live closer to it however the line is Italy out the door. Remember they only do breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed recent visits to First Watch in route 52 South Hills location. I've been wanting to try it and wasn't disappointed. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the restaurant, friendliness of the staff and selection of breakfast options. Coffee is available to guests waiting for their table which was a nice touch!   Our food was served promptly and everything was fresh except some of the avocado on my avocado toast had already turned brown. I don't know if this was because the avocado was overripe or if it was mixed up the day before. It still edible and tasted good. I'm still willing to try it again. I highly recommend getting something from the juice bar. The chilled pear apple cider was delightful!   Prices were also very reasonable. Looking forward to trying First Watch again."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service was very slow.   This is my second visit to this location. After being seated, the wait to ask about drinks or if we were ready to order was very long.   Then when we received our food it was the wrong items.   This Visit I waited ten minutes for someone to ask if I want anything to drink."}
{"text":"Disappointment experiences not only because of the food but also cause waiters just show us a silly face all the time"}
{"text":"My girlfriend arrived at this establishment at 10:30 am was told the wait would be 10-15minutes by the lady in front of the restaurant. When we asked the lady how many people we had ahead of us she told us 2 parties when really there were 5parties ahead of us. We waited 40 minutes before we were finally sat.   As we approached our sitting area there were 4-8 tables dirty that we could've been sat in. But they weren't being tended too.   We ordered the trifecta, which is probably the simplest thing to make on the menu. A 5th grader can make eggs and pancake for crying out loud. Our waiter, came to get our drinks and we had to wait another 10minutes before we she took our order. After placing our order we waited for our food, and the wait was so long we had to take or food to go and asked for the check early. This is the worst treatment I've receive in a restaurant when it comes to wait times. Thank you for ruining my Sunday morning, with your poor service."}
{"text":"Super cool place with good customer service. Totally recommend for a healthy pick me up breakfast. Hung out for couple of hours. Avocado toast would be a must have. Should probably add yourself on yelps wait list before going to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Let's start with the most important meal of the day: #Breakfast !!! First Watch -  I love the Market Skillet (no cheese), the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were not bad, and the seasonal menu has never disappointed. Their Morning meditation drink is a delicious drink and one of my favorite \"to-go\" drinks to keep me refreshed in the AZ heat :D."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend and loved the food! I ordered the chickichanga for breakfast and was quite satisfied since I wanted a Mexican type of breakfast.  The service was good and the place kind of reminded me of IHop but I would give it a 4 stars because the waitress made me feel like she was rushing me to leave after she served me my food and handed me the check so quickly..."}
{"text":"I first heard about First Watch through a friend.    My first reaction: \"First Watch?  Sounds like an insurance company\" My friend: \"Yeah, I thought it was some sort of weight loss program\" Another friend who I invited along: \"Oh that place? I thought they sold watches!\"  Name confusion aside, we came here for brunch on a Sunday.  It was fairly busy, with a 25 minute wait, which wasn't so bad since they have free coffee at the counter for you.  I didn't have any, but my friend said it tasted good.  We got seated and the waitress took our orders.  When it came to my turn to order, I pointed out what I wanted on the menu (eggs benedict florentine) and the waitress repeated what I said.  About five minutes later, another waitress comes by and asks us \"whoever had the skillet, how did you want your eggs?\"  We all look at each other- no one ordered a skillet?    The waitress said she'd get the original waitress to sort it out.  Well... a few minutes after that,  yet another waitress comes along and sorts out our orders.  Apparently the person taking my order wrote down skillet instead of eggs benedict, even though she repeated what I had ordered, and saw what I had pointed to on the menu.  To be fair, she was new on the job, but in general it seemed like the service was unorganized (after we got all our food yet ANOTHER waitress came by with another order of my friend's food- oops for them)  So.... food is good, service is spotty, and I was slightly grossed out by the bits of stuck on egg that was left on my knife.  It took me 3 times of asking the various waitresses to get a new knife!  I'm giving this a marginal 3 stars because of the food alone though since the eggs benedict was in fact very tasty."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate at a First Watch was in Cleveland. Generally I try to avoid eating anywhere that reminds me of Cleveland, but a tempting BOGO offer lured me in and this was the last day to redeem the offer!  We got here around noon on Sunday and there were no parking spots in the lot whatsoever, even after circling the lot a few times. We had to park on the side street a short distance away. When we got to the restaurant the hostess quoted us at about 35-40 minutes wait. The paging system is by cell phone which is nice and also gives you a link to show where you are on the list compared to other people. It took about 30 minutes for a table to open up. We chose first available seating and we got a nice shady corner spot on the patio.   Waiting 30 minutes gives you a lot of time to decide on what you want to order so we placed our meal orders right when the server came by to ask what we'd like to drink. I had the smoked salmon and roasted vegetable frittata. The orders took a bit of time to arrive since it was busy. When they did arrive the plates looked nicely presented. My frittata had well seasoned, fluffy eggs and I enjoyed the tomatoes, chives, and shallots in it. I really disliked the smoked salmon though. I'd say I enjoyed everything about the frittata except for that main protein. It was a large portion which I appreciated, but all I could taste was salt. I couldn't eat all of it. My husband ate the rest of the salty salty salmon and then remarked \"I thought salmon was supposed to be healthy for you\". His actual meal were the breakfast tacos which looked pretty good. The filling on the tacos was really watery though and it was hard for him to actually pick up the tacos and eat them because all the liquid caused the middle of the tortillas to become really soggy and fall apart.  With so many breakfast spots in the East Valley, based on the longer wait time and sodium overload, I'd most likely pass on this spot to go to other places during the weekend."}
{"text":"I had the Key West Crepegg and my dad had the Chicken Salad Melt with the tomato basil soup. Everything was great. The Kale drink was really good as well!!"}
{"text":"I am spending my first month of 2017 in Cleveland, Ohio, and I've decided to head to First Watch after checking in to my housing. First real meal in Cleveland and I was pleasantly surprised by this cute brunch/lunch place and the food.  I guess I was still hungover from NYE and wanted to eat something heavy, eggy, and savory. I got the following:  pot roast hash 9.99   3.5 stars I saw the picture and it looked like everything i ever wanted and more: pot roast, roasted potatoes with over medium eggs on top. When it came out, it looks like everything I expected and more. The food was great. The only thing I would say is that the pot roast was on the saltier side. I don't like salt to begin with. So if you are a salt lover, I think this would be perfect! Overall however, the potatoes were wonderful and eggs were cooked to perfection. I thoroughly enjoyed it and inhaled the food.  morning meditation 3.99  5 stars now THIS!!!! freshly squeezed juice. my favorite ingredients including ginger, lemon, and tumeric, and beet juice. I think i am missing another main ingredient but the juice was absolutely delicious. I am not a juice person but man!!! this perked me up and my hangover and the nausea was GONE!  Overall I would totally recommend this place for brunch or lunch! I think I saw that this was a chain, which is very interesting!  TIPS: -It's in a large plaza and located adjacent to Old navy -parking is ample -you bring your ticket to the front to pay for your meal -you can leave cash tip on the table or when you pay with cc at the front -if you don't want to wait for a table, grab a seat at the communal table!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant wait staff.  A little scattered but busy morning.  Coffee good.  A little overboard with the \"free range, all natural, multi-grain\" options if you are looking for traditional breakfast options but that is perhaps a personal preference.  Thought perhaps my fault for not viewing the menu more closely,  disappointed that a salad is the side with a traditional breakfast omelet with potatoes \"upon request \". Has salad really become a preferred breakfast option?  I think they should bring this to the patron's attention upon ordering as I have to think the majority still would view potatoes as a preferred breakfast side. Overall not bad experience. My wife loved it. Just probably not first choice for someone who is more of a traditionalist breakfast eater."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. Best breakfast potatoes I've had in a long time. Wheat toast bread is amazing. Excellent service. Nice and clean."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch after being unsure of the concept. I generally lean towards more traditional breakfast places. Upon entry the restaurant is very modern and hip looking. It was busy but the wait was only about 20 mins. I liked that they used your phone number to text you when your table is ready.  Upon sitting, we were greeted by a friendly waitress who offered a variety of juices, special drinks, water, coffee etc. I opted for water which came in a old style milk jar container, and my wife had coffee. The menu is large enough to offer variety but small enough to be manageable.  This is not the type of place that offers the run of the mill eggs and bacon.  Everything has a twist, fusion aspect, or trendy play on traditional breakfast staples. I chose the smoked salmon frittada, and my wife went for the chicken salad melt. We also put in for their biscuits and gravy.   I was excited for the biscuits and gravy, they looked amazing. After tasting though, I would not order again. The biscuits had a strange consistency/were very dark on the bottom, and the gravy was turkey based. My frittada was good. I liked the flavors but found their use of tomato completely unbalanced the dish. With the suttle flavors of creme, parmesan, herbs, and chives complimenting smoked salmon why through in large blistered tomato chunks? Awful sensation to get a bite of that when the other flavors were great. I also noted for a dish advertising smoked salmon, it had one small chunk, and a few small bits throughout. The lightly dressed salad on the side was forgettable and out of place.  My wife enjoyed the chicken salad but would have ordered sans the melted cheese. The bread it came on was good, and the chicken and wild rice soup was great. She also enjoyed the coffee that was served.   After we finished, we paid our bill with tax and tip amounted to just over $32. My only recommendation would be the speed of service from ordering it took quite awhile to receive our food 27 mins. This is not a huge issue though as this place was packed,  and the food was very fresh and hot when served."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and so is the food. The restaurant is very clean and cozy. It has table and booth seating, as well as, cozy chairs, sofas, and bistro style tables. The restrooms were also very clean."}
{"text":"The food is always good. You can eat healthy or choose to blow the diet. We have eaten at different locations and have never been disappointed with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! We stopped in for breakfast and had put ourselves on the call-ahead list. While we got seated fairly quickly our food service was incredibly slow. We ordered simple items, pancakes, eggs, toast, not even a sandwich or burrito, something that might take extra care and time. Nope. Just regular ol' breakfast. Took us 2.5 hours. Never had a breakfast service take that much time. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this restaurant 3 stars because the food was yummy. I would give it a 1 star for service. The wait time for the meals was just too long. What could have easily been at 45min meal took about 2 hours. With a 5 and 7 year old, waiting that long for pancakes is just a nightmare. Our waitress was sweet but forgetful and seemed to be loaded down with more tables than she could handle. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really great food with quick takeout. Awesome service and waiting area (free infused water and good coffee. Potatoes are really well seasoned and cooked too. My millennial alarms were firing with my love for the avocado toast as well...#noshame"}
{"text":"Am I disappointed? Yes! Is the food bad? No. Was the Good Egg better? Yes! Will we go back? No! They changed the menu, They gave us large plates with smaller meals They changed the decor Was it an improvement? Hell no!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I got their fresh pear juice and avocado toast. I always try and try new places but I was craving to come back to first watch all week."}
{"text":"We live across the street from First Watch on Camelback, so taking a morning stroll over for Sunday breakfast is such A treat. I usually have the Carrott Cake Pancake, and this is DELICIOUS! My husband really likes thier omelettes and has been pleased every time. Nice start to a Sunday!"}
{"text":"I've fallen in love with First Watch in Tempe and have visited this one here by work infrequently, but this time after waiting to be served, or any acknowledgment of existence after 15 I just left.  No more worries about the spotty glasses and utensils they usually keep me away.   Too bad I don't have the option of zero stars."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. The decor is very woodsy and the music was indie. The waitress came to me quickly. I got a melon cooler to drink and a pesto chicken quinoa bowl to eat. It was very all very good. Highly recommended for brunch."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. We have heard good things about it. Despite the wait, our service was good - well, our waitress was good...very good actually. We were seated near the kitchen and could see/hear the staff back there. They all appeared to be very young and did not look as if they were taking their jobs seriously. There was a lot of goofing off...hence why it took our food 25 minutes to come out and why it was cold and rubbery when we were finally served. Our 2 year old's pancake was dry, over cooked, and burnt on the underside. He wouldn't touch it. My husband's breakfast tacos were good, but they had obviously been sitting around a while as the taco shells were cold and cracked. He liked the breakfast potatoes just fine. My breakfast was on a whole other level of bad. The turkey sausage gravy was not milk based - it appeared broth based. Very unappealing to the eye...and palette. It looked liked soupy dog food. The scrambled eggs were rubbery and cold - again...the whole kitchen staff thing. The potatoes were fine, just not my taste. Very greasy. The best part...the coffee and tea. My husband liked that they gave you a carafe of coffee at your table so you could replenish your own cup. In a nutshell, my husband would go back...I probably won't. I think I'd be a lot more forgiving, since it was Saturday and busy, but the kitchen staff's unprofessional behavior just bothered me. I'm not sure where the adults were???"}
{"text":"Food was okay, pretty cold  and the food came out immediately so it seems like it might just be sitting in the back. Definitely wouldn't come back if I had another option. Also got the check while still eating (practically right after getting the food , seemed like the waitress was trying to rush us out yet there wasn't even a wait nor was the restaurant busy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about this place, the food is very good especially the protein pancakes but the manager doesn't seem to acknowledge you unless you are of Caucasian descent. This is my best guess coming from a social behavioral science background. I noticed as I watched him greet all the customers he slightly skipped over the darker shade of brown. I'll keep going back though, the protein pancakes and coffee are on spot. I would also love to know I'm wrong."}
{"text":"Have had brunch w family a couple of times now and other than occasional slowish service everything here is wonderful. Great pancakes, platy of fresh options, great eggs and some very good sandwiches. Very polite and competent staff. This place can get pretty busy so you will likely wait a bit for a table on Sunday's which is when we have gone, but that is to be expected. Their eggs Benedict is a treat. Get some!~"}
{"text":"I think I just ate the most tasty breakfast sandwich in my life. The Elevated Egg Sandwich was just full of flavor. The bacon was crispy yet juicy and lemon dressed arugula was a beautiful touch. Also, the juice bar, with only two options, were tasty!  The place was packed on Sunday morning so obviously the word is out. The prices were average but the flavor was amazing. Very clean and friendly staff. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened here? I've been coming to this location for years and this is the first time they dropped the ball on all levels.  When asked for their standard allergy chart, the server had no clue what I was talking about. I explained and she said she'd worked there for two months and had never heard of such a thing. Eventually, she asked and found one in the back. Geez.  We ordered. One diner specified a BLT with no fried egg and white bread...also specified nut allergies. I ordered the bacon hash skillet and specified no bread or wheat products because of celiac disease. The first came with egg and On bread containing seeds and nuts? Mine came with an English muffin. Both orders were clearly wrong and potentially life threatening. What happened? Lack of Training? Nonchalance?  This location can NOT be trusted to deal with food allergy issues although they profess to be allergy friendly. Beware!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I went there for brunch and ordered a veggie burger, which tasted like it was home made. I then had tomato basil soup instead of fries, and that tasted amazing as well. I had a great smoothie as well with chai in it....delicious. So looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Yummmm their breakfast is great! Every time we visit AZ, we have to have first watch!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. You can expect a wait on Sunday but it was over an hour. Been to these before so figured it would be worth the wait. Place was disorganized. Not enough help. Waitresses didn't seem to know which table was theirs to wait on. Food was terrible. Everything was over cooked. Will never return."}
{"text":"Live up the street from First Watch and we absolutely love coming here! They have healthy and fresh options which is so nice. I really appreciate that they put the calories on the menu like finally! - why can't everyone else get on board. Anyway from the avo toast to the eggs Benedict's to the healthy options everything is SO good. Oh and I can't forget the kale tonic! Such a must."}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty, I enjoy coming to this place for breakfast or brunch. Whether it's the waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, or traditional food, it's always tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the avocado toast.  I've been here a few times and it's hit or miss with the menu.  Some things are really good and others are just ok.  At these prices just ok shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite breakfast place. I recommend the banana granola crunch pancake (just one because they're huge) and the strawberry basil drink. The potatoes are also amazing. Everything here is so good!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for business for a couple of days, walked into this place yesterday drank a fresh juice ate an omelette with salmon and coffee. If I came today, that says enough, no??!!!! Highly recommend total bill - 18 $"}
{"text":"i just don't get this place.....what's the appeal???? crappy, overprice, average food, not far above a denny's or bob evans......egg crapes are disgusting, service non existant. GO TO A FAMILY STYLE JOINT.....this place just sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! Went with the family this past Saturday and had the carrot cake pancakes (10/10). Everyone else ordered omelette and pancakes as well and couldn't have been happier with their choices. However I felt the need to knock off 3 stars because our service was absolutely atrocious.   I'm not normally one to be too bothered by slow service (as I've worked in 3 different restaurants), however, this was some of the most inattentive and unpleasant service I've ever had eating out.  After taking our order our server did not return until after we were halfway done with our meal (our food was brought to us by runners). The worst part of this is that we had run out of water before our food even arrived. After she finally checked on us to ask us about our food and we asked her for water it still took another 5 minutes before we got refills (this whole time we saw her walking around the restaurant and standing in the back).   Overall I would recommend First Watch to others because I assume they will not receive the same service, however it was very disappointing for us."}
{"text":"Ordered the ham and gruyere cheese with potatoes. Maybe not the best choice in omelette but definitely have eaten better ham omelettes. Potatoes were bland. They don't make hash browns which I prefer over breakfast potatoes. Better breakfast places around. Not interested in eating here again."}
{"text":"I had the avocado toast with a side of bacon.  The eggs were very good also!!!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really good spot. A little pricey but very good quality food, and service was great."}
{"text":"Went to First Watch this afternoon and waited about 40 minutes to get seated. I ordered blueberry pancakes and about 30 minutes later our order arrived. The bottom pancake on my plate was missing half of a pancake and I called the manager to indicate that I ordered 2 pancakes rather one and a half. She took it back and about 15 minutes later they brought back a full 2 pancake order. When I went to pay the bill I was greeted by a cashier who had a large disgusting nose ring. The other servers had nose rings and tattoos all over their arms and shoulders. I will never go back there again....my appetite was lost when I saw this display of body mutilation from several of the workers there."}
{"text":"My food was ok not so great.  My side of potatoes was cold and the biscuits and gravy was one biscuit cut in half and smothered with a not so tasty gravy. Breakfast bill was $32 and thought I had better food at other places near by.   This is the second time here and the hubby's food seems to come out just fine or he's too polite to complain.  They did get one thing right,  the drinks.. Kale juice tonic and coffee in a pot so we can refill our own mugs. I'll give it one more try to see if they can redeem themselves.  Hoping to at least give this place 3 stats on my next visit."}
{"text":"If you are an individual who has lived near Mill avenue for over a decade you have to realize how incronguous it is to have a nice breakfast place open in you area. At one time breakfast, a decent breakfast, was not to be had in the area. Over time that has changed, with places like Ncounter at the top of Mill and Snooze on College avenue. Well, you can add First Watch to that list. It has taken the place of what was once a bicycle sales and repair shop and it is great!  I actually heard from a neighbor that they were doing a family and friends opening with donations to Phoenix Children's hospital in place of paying for the meal. I planned to go in Sunday so stopped by today and ended up staying for breakfast. I have never eaten at a First Watch before and found this place was airy and open with a friendly staff and even though I was warned it is in the testing phase excellent service all around.   I had the Italian Omelette, that comes with a small green salad and toast, along with the a fresh squeezed juice (also amazing), and coffee. Right off the bat I liked that they give you a small carafe for the coffee so you can pour as you need it and the coffee stays hot and it is good coffee. They do a similar thing with the water, giving you a glass bottle from which you can also pour as needed so you never have to wait for a refill, which I like a lot!   The  toast does come buttered so if you want it dry you probably need to ask for it and I also like that a small side of fresh jam comes with the toast, which is a whole grain variety and delicious. As for the Omelette, tasty though I would like the mozzarella to  be a bit more gooey to hold everything together but it tasted great.  Another big thing, the prices are quite reasonable. My omelette breakfast, by itself, was about $10 and the coffee, before tax, is $2.75 so you can eat a decent breakfast for $20 or less. I, for one, intend to be a regular Sunday breakfast person at First Watch and I'm happy to have it as another high quality breakfast option for the ASU community. As it opens at 7 am as older folks in the area can get in and have quiet breakfast before the rest of the ASU community is up and headed out to start the day. Welcome to the neighborhood First Watch! :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing place, came here with my kid and thought we would try this place out. The Kale Tonic is amazing, the food is healthy and he atmosphere is cool. Very laid back!! Love it"}
{"text":"If you like waffles, you have to try the cinnamon roll waffle!! This has to be one of the best ones I've ever tasted. Its drizzled with cream cheese frosting and comes with cinnamon syrup and pecans. Its on the seasonal menu but I wish they would put it on the main menu. It is sooooo delicious I went two times in one week so I could have this waffle. First Watch please add this waffle to the main menu!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Unique options to choose from and all great. This time however, got the smoked salmon frittata. Not a fan. Fishy taste."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was excellent. Had the Elevated Egg Sandwich (minus bacon) and it was delicious. The lemon dressed arugula gave the entire sandwich a nice zing. Also, the orange juice was fresh and yummy. No mimosas, which is a little bit of a downer, but they don't pretend to serve alcohol, so it won't reflect in their score. Highly recommend. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having breakfast at First Watch. It was a quick decision along my route from Toronto to Indiana. I ordered the Kale Tonic and Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. For those of you who haven't had a green juice before, their kale tonic is absolutely delicious. Don't worry, it has more of a sweet fruity flavor than the kale itself. Normally I don't order eggs Benedict since I won't eat the bacon that comes with it, but their version on ciabatta with smoked salmon is to die for. It seemed a bit pricey for breakfast, at least for what I ordered, but I highly recommend First Watch for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Let's preface this review by saying that we eat breakfast at First Watch probably three Sunday's a month and have for maybe the past three years or so. I'm acutely aware of their product, what to expect service wise, food quality wise, etc.  I'm a creature of habit. Change throws me off and today 4/10/16 it really did. Their menu has changed dramatically. Items removed, items added, names of items changed. What comes with items has changed. An omelet now comes standard with a mixed green salad, no longer with breakfast potatoes.   No longer is an English muffin provided, but whole grain toast. I get it, maybe it's a bit more healthy, but that's irrelevant when it's soaked in butter. Granted these items are still available and they can be asked for, but why?  They added some popular specials to the menu which are now standard items and that's great because they're enjoyed by many.   Also, I come here expecting strong coffee, today, it was terrible. Weak, watered down. The second carafe they provided was better.   Food quality was suffering today as well. We were told the breakfast potatoes were changed and are better now...they're not. There was nothing wrong with them previously. They were cut uniformly, cooked uniformly and seasoned uniformly. The new and improved potatoes are bland and tasteless. They're not better.  Today was a flop, and I've never said that in all of the time we've been eating here. Going to skip it for awhile and see if things improve down the line.   7/26/17 - Update  First Watch has long since fixed their issues and all is right again. Product quality is top tier."}
{"text":"OMG this restaurant exceeded my expectations. From the crisp water to the amazing multi-grain pancakes. The waiters were very nice and brought a laugh. I started with just some water and then someone in my party had coffee and they had great selection for creamer."}
{"text":"Absolutely fresh and delicious. Great way to start my day :-) the restaurant is an adorable place to stoping you're in the area.... very fun clean and quaint. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for somewhere to get healthy breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"This menu is so unique and special!  The service was superb and I love this place so much!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a breakfast place around this area. The ambiance of First Watch is nice, very homey and welcoming. Service can be really 50/50; sometimes it's perfectly fine, and other times it's pretty bad. The food is pretty typical, nothing \"above and beyond\", but it's not bad food I would say, just more so average. The food does tend to come out quickly, so if you're short on time, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"FirstWatch is a Nice place for breakfast or lunch. Keep in mind it closes at 2pm. Breakfast choices range regular staples like  pancakes and eggs, to special items such as avocado toast or even Chilaquiles! The specials change based on the season, availability of fresh ingredients, etc, so be sure to check the big chalkboard which will give you the most up to date menu. Same advice applies for their lunch menu. Coffee is smooth and the refills are plentiful. And the service is always quick and friendly. It's good for a weekday business meeting, or a weekend out with the family. Keep in mind that it can get very busy on weekends, so go onto the 'NoWait' app and get into the queue before leaving home. You can never go wrong choosing FirstWatch."}
{"text":"I was so excited to spend my birthday breakfast here but after waiting 40 minutes to be seated, I wasn't even offered a drink. The waiter saw that I already had a drink from when I went to Dutch just before to get my free birthday drink. She didn't even greet us correctly and only gave us two glasses and silverware when we had 3 people. We didn't even stay to eat because of her attitude. Will not be back. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This is a chain that I've been to in various different locations. This was my first visit to the Westlake First Watch.  Atmosphere: This location is located in Crocker park. The interior is pleasant enough. It didn't feel too chaotic like some busy breakfasts spot end up being.   Service: My service was very pleasant. The check came in a good amount of time, the cashier was pleasant as well.  Food: I ordered scrambled egg whites with avocado slices and hash browns with cheese. The food was okay, nothing stood out but nothing was bad. Nothing really more to report. I would eat here again, but I wish they offered gluten free bread."}
{"text":"Love this place and this location. The food always seems to be pretty good and we usually have great service. I always tend to stick on the safe side by getting their Eggs Benedict or traditional breakfast, which are both delicious. However, the new addition of the breakfast tacos are also amazing! On my last visit, I ordered the morning meditation, one of their new freshly squeezed juices, and it was fantastic. (This is coming from a person who usually does not like stuff like that.)   Overall, great chain restaurant and neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"First Watch has evolved to a delicious modern place to spend your morning. I get the Traditional breakfast but have also enjoy the humongous blueberry whole grain pancake and the Morning Wake up Call drink with turmeric and best juice is divine."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the Regional Manger after our last experience and was asked to give them another try. The difference was night and day! Fast, friendly and efficient service. As, always, great food. This latest experience shows that our last visit was an anomoly. I'm a fan again.  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! Such cute rustic decor! We were sat in a timely manner and the food came out quick! Everything tasted very fresh and healthy! I wish the potatoes were cooked a little longer and they lacked seasoning. But besides that very good and definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"4/17/18: Had lunch with friends at First Watch; it was a delightful experience. I wasn't expecting that I would like it as much as I did... I mean it's so easy to make breakfast at home; we've all done it and we're all good at it. But, the crew here take their cooking seriously, and by the end of the meal I was convinced that letting them prepare my breakfast was well worth the trip.  I had the Frittata Rustica, which is an Italian style omelette with kale, roasted crimini mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, mozzarella and parmesan. I chose the lightly dressed greens as the side. The frittata was cooked just right and the greens were fresh. Delicious. Our server was very attentive and I'm greatly,  The Owner, (I believe his name was Manack), came by our table and talked with us for a while; he asked about our meal and for feedback... I really liked that.   I think First Watch will become a regular experience for me."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Fresh quality ingredients, healthy choice options with calories listed on all items. Great fresh artesian bread choices, jams and breakfast potatoes. Many choices fir breakfast and lunch.  Expect to wait for a table during peak times and weekends although worth the wait. Community table available for quick breakfasts."}
{"text":"ehh.. it's ok, but a little more organic than your standard eggs, bacon and toast meal.  They have a variety of items on the menu but they are a little pricey for breakfast.  The food was good, service was very good, but I don't know if I would go there again."}
{"text":"After a bike ride of 30+ miles, we came here after we saw this huge line at Matt's across the street. No line, sat right down on the patio. We had a great server, tried the multi grain pancakes with fresh blue berries. Friends had plain pancakes, and also tried the bacon cheddar pancake and breakfast wrap. Everything was delicious, coffee was excellent and our server was very friendly. Most important, kept the water bottle full along with the carafe of coffee.  First Watch is always consistent with their food, never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never had anything but exceptional meals and service at First Watch. My kids beg to go here too. I love the avocado toast the best. I dream about their kale tonic. I've tried to recreate it at home to no avail."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Every meal I've had here has been superb. Service is spectacular and I am so happy to have found this cute,  yummy breakfast cafe!! You must try it too!!!"}
{"text":"The Good Egg is no more, long live First Watch!  The interior has been refreshed and the menu has been updated, of course breakfast is breakfast so eggs, toast and omelettes are still the mainstays!"}
{"text":"Tiffany was awesome! Food was great and service was incredible. Great vibe and a great special menu. Definitely a place to stop by in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came back for brunch with my family today after having a poor experience last month. Our server Michelle was very attentative and polite. My daughter enjoyed her breakfast and I decided to go with lunch. I had a half a club sandwich and a cobb salad. Portion size was good, and both items were tasty. I enjoyed everything about my meal, and I would definately return again as well as reccomend them to friends and family. Thank you for the excellent customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"Good food selection with standard breakfast options. Some healthy choices. Only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last - eggs Benedict with bacon arugula and avocado was very nice and enjoyed every bit of it. The only thing I wanted was a bit more potatoes as they were good too.  Nice place with excellent staff!"}
{"text":"Food was great and loved the atmosphere.  My family members loved the \"Morning Meditation\" juice.  Experience was tainted by a bad waitress experience.  She must have drank a coffee with an extra shot of grumpiness."}
{"text":"So the food was good, it was more of a thirty minute wait when they said 20. The reason why I gave it two stars was because of how messy just about every table was. When I sat down I counted 8 dirty tables!!!!!!! Not only that there was only about 4 different parties waiting to be seated. There was a table that was dirty the entire time we were waiting, and it was finally cleaned 45 minutes later into our meal. It was gross, there was a child's high chair and crumbs every where, I don't want to be dining at a place that doesn't clean tables as soon as the customers are gone. We dined for about an hour, never once did I see  a manager, it was a Friday morning, and if it's going to be busy the manager should be helping clean tables, the entire time I only saw one bus person, which was an older man. I also saw no more than three servers, and this was mid morning around 1030 on a Friday, why was there no manager around!? This place is good with the food but unfortunately no one wants to dine when there is 8 dirty tables surrounding you, it's gross. And that was just in the main part, when I was leaving I saw three more dirt tables in the back corner. So all in all, good food, but obviously not very good management if they aren't on the floor the keep things in order. I most likely won't be back again, I'd rather try my luck at a different place next time"}
{"text":"This restaurant is near my office and me and the boy stopped in on our way back to Tempe from Carefree for breakfast this morning. There were quite a few people waiting before us, but the wait was about 20 minutes and we didn't mind waiting. We perused the menu while we were waiting and didn't take too long to order once we were seated. I got the tri-fecta with a chocolate chip pancake and a side of toast and my bf had the 1/2 lunch special with the beefeater, cobb salad, and biscuits and gravy. My meal was pretty standard, but good nonetheless. I am interested in tasting the other whole grain pancakes they have. My bf really liked his meal. The service was great and I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"These restaurants are popping up all over, and what a relief! Simple, healthy, fresh farm to table food is what most restaurants are lacking. Their food is fantastic, even when we ordered to go. The wait staff is courteous and fast. I'd recommend First Watch as a favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"I love the healthy options here! I also love the variety. Family that prefers the standard fare is also available. The specialty juices are my favorites."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in town. Id recommend them to anyone. Plan on going back in the near future."}
{"text":"We had a really great Father's Day breakfast here.  Their welcoming smiles, quick service and great food SAVED Father's Day for us.  We had to leave another establishment that morning with our party of 6 because of seating policies and abusive hostesses but the great staff at First Watch turned it all around.  Two of us had the tri-fecta: eggs, meat and a huge absolutely delicious banana granola crunch pancake. The veggie omelet was very tasty, cleanly presented and the fruit fresh. The others had a variety of other items and all thought it was excellent and prepared to their liking. The attentive service was excellent with a continual flow of coffee, tea and water.  Thanks First Watch!"}
{"text":"The food was too expensive for the quality i received. I had the Parm skillet w/sausage. It was very bland, way too many country potatoes and not enough sausage, coffee and tip it was $17. Hopefully by writing this review it'll remind me to stop coming here."}
{"text":"So I went yesterday with my grandma to brunch and overall we left happy but it could have gone the other way. It was rather crowded and it was a 15 min wait, which was fine. We were sat within the promised 15 min. When we say down, my coffee mug has something that looked like a clump of chocolate powder left in it, but my grandma didn't want coffee so I used her cup. The server, a taller guy with glasses and a tan complection, made up for it by bringing me a mug of vanilla creamer pods when I asked for more and said I like a lot of cream.  It took some time to get our order in, but the server had been at least triple sat if not more. When we ordered, my grandma got an omlete and I got the blt eggs Benedict. It took over 20 min to get our food. Finally the server brought out my grandma's omlete and apologized saying the kitchen was having issues with my meal. My grandma was livid because we were trying to make it to a movie and at this rate we would miss it, and told the server so. At this point I had decided to write a yelp review because I was so unhappy/hangry. Finally my food did arrive and the server apologized and told us our meal was taken care of so we could just leave when we were done to get to our movie.   The eggs Benedict was amazing. I got the blt version with potatoes and it was an amazing choice. My grandma's omlete was odd, all of the toppings were on the bottom and she said she won't be getting an omlete there again. The server checked back in and apologized again saying he was back in the kitchen trying to get my food out but it was out of his control. I saw him running all kinds of food and being a server I know that means he was in there trying to make stuff happen.   The server saved out meal and we are going to try and go back before my trip is over. I figured if I was ready to write a negative yelp review, I better be ready to change my tune and write a decent one."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. They take real care with their menu and quality of food offered. I really appreciated that my pumpkin pancake was not sweet. That way I could enjoy the warm maple syrup without too much sugar in my breakfast.  My husband likes their take on Eggs Benedict and likes the option of salmon instead of just ham."}
{"text":"If breakfast is your fav meal then First Watch is for you. If you like a healthy breakfast then First Watch is for you. I have been there a couple of times and have never been disappointed. When you walk in it is very inviting. You feel welcomed. The colors are warm. Two of the three times I have been there I have ordered the same thing-The Ham and Gruyere omelette. It is big and not for the small appetite. You have a choice of three sides-Home fries, salad, and I'm blank on the third (sorry). I go for the potatoes. The omelette is packed with flavor. It looks dense but tastes fluffy. My favorite part though is the toast. In Pittsburgh a lot of places serve Italian bread, which I love, but First Watch serves a Texas toast sized piece of dense bread loaded with grains. I've decided the next time I go in I'm ordering a breakfast sandwich. Nothing like preplanning your next meal at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was here and waited 30 min before a waiter even saw me.  I had come before and didn't wait so long but the manager was in the front on his phone just standing there. While I could tell they were short handed with servers at the time he still did not help me with anything besides seating me. When I asked why he didn't serve me he replied \"that's not my job\". I love the food just not the service sorry."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place when I was there today! I had one of the seasonal menu items, the croque madame, and OMG, it was AMAZING! And, it actually came out looking like the picture in the ad, how often does that happen? It was great, and I can't wait to take my hubby and kids with me when I go back!"}
{"text":"I met a couple friends here for a 9:00 breakfast. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server introduced himself and took our beverage orders.  My friends ordered the Multigrain Pancakes, Skillet Hash-Farmhouse and I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine. I can only review my breakfast which I thought was very OK. Bland is the perfect description. Though my dish looked very good the poached egg was well done. I did not make a big deal about it because I was with friends who seemed like they were enjoying their dishes.  Service was good until the very end when we wanted the bill. Our server seemed to have disappeared. We had to stop another server to ask and still had to wait 20 minutes to be exact.  Sorry, so many other places to go."}
{"text":"After not being a favorable fan, I was enticed to give First Watch another chance, thank you to corporate. This time because we were in the area we tried this location. I'm happy to say the service was very good.  We came here for breakfast. I ordered the Eggs Benedict - Florentine (again) and my friend ordered a Bacon Cheese Omelet, both coming with a side salad of Mixed Greens. The Eggs Benedict was prepared better, the eggs were poached more runnier than before. All in all much improved than my last experience.  If you are looking for a more healthier version of breakfast, low sodium, no spice, then this is the place. It's good but healthy.  Atmosphere: good, Service: very good, Food: good but very healthy tasting if that's your goal."}
{"text":"Have been here at least 3 times in the last 2 months.  The food is always good and the service is perfect.  Line-ups get a little long on the weekends."}
{"text":"The Floridian French Toast was absolutely delicious. Their orange juice is fresh squeezed and amazing too. Very cozy atmosphere. The employees are so sweet and nice."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they open this place near my house, I was getting tired of IHOP. I love this place because they have healthy choices. I always get the avocado, tomato hash it's so good I love it. Their green juice is also very good."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Had the Trifecta (eggs scrambled with bacon and a multigrain banana pancake). Eggs were runny but bacon and pancake were excellent. Service was below par. Waitress took order and never saw her again. Other staff members delivered our food for us and we never got a drink refill. This location has always had pretty good food and depending on what you order the price isn't too bad, but the service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy in Phoenix has amazing service and very good food! They're worth the drive. You won't be disappointed. Coincidentally, I went there b/c it was right next door to the Courtyard Marriott. I have been back several times and continue to receive excellent customer service and delicious food.   My favorite breakfast is their Tri-Athlete omelette; which I hesitatingly tried b/c it was a healthy choice but fell in love with it! Wonderfully roasted vegetables in an egg-white only omelette topped with salsa...muahhh, magnifico!!  For lunch I had their Pecan Dijon chicken salad...wow, another amazing dish full of flavors...good to the last drop!  And lastly, their customer service...always SPOT ON! Once we had only 15 minutes. Informed the always-welcoming staff and VOILA, an excellent breakfast in exactly 15 minutes. I'll be back soon!   Thank you First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy!! You're awesome :)"}
{"text":"This has always been a favorite location but it's been awhile since we've been here.  Found a remodeled interior when we came in for breakfast.  Very nice updating, flexible seating to allow for larger parties and bartop dining.  Nothing wrong with the old decor but perhaps this is required to be in line with the franchise requirements.    Quite sad to learn that cinnamon raisin bread French toast has been removed from the Menu.  This has always been a favorite, why discontinued?  The summer specials caught my eye so I tried the special ciabatta French toast with Nutella & strawberries.  We also ordered a carrot cake pancake and bacon.    The special French toast was a huge disappointment.  It looked absolutely gorgeous but unfortunately nobody taught the cook how to make French toast.  The bread was barely introduced to the egg batter so it was only slightly coated.  It was like eating a warm piece of bread with syrup on it.  No, I did not mention this to our server (who was very good by the way).  The carrot cake pancake which filled the plate and the belly was very tasty.  Good quality bacon cooked crispy as requested.  I'd like to stick with the old tried-and-true picks at First Watch but they keep messing with the menu and removing all my favorites (no more turkey dill crepe either).  I will give First Watch another try because they have always delivered.  This time they delivered disappointment."}
{"text":"We came to First Watch on Wednesday with the gals for breakfast. The hostess waited until all seven of us were present to seat us. This allowed us to catch up in pairs while we waited. We sat at two large tables pushed together.   Adam was our server. He was very warm welcoming and attentive. He brought our table several coffee decaf and regular pitchers, along with water carfes to share. He handled our orders with ease.  I had the Hibiscus Limeade to drink. It came with a lime and hibiscus leaf as garnish. It was very light and refreshing. Perfect for summertime!  I ordered the Rainbow Toast, 2 eggs over easy, and a side of home potatoes. The Rainbow Toast is off the summer special menu. It is brioche toast smothered with Ricotta cheese, topped with a rainbow of fresh fruit, bunches of granola, then drizzled with honey. Blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and mango are the juicy fresh fruit featured. It was a delightful representation of a summertime rainbow! The two eggs were basic diner food cooked right. The home potatoes were big golden chunks. They could have been more well-done.   The decor was redone to be a sheek farm-table style. The new shelves and lighting were very attractive!"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and service is generally fantastic, just avoid the sloppy blonde waitress. First she told us they didn't have a specific pancake we asked for that we had gotten the week before, and told us they'd never had it. My boyfriend just asked for something else, and our food was served to us shortly. Everything was delicious, except when she walked by again and literally tossed our ticket onto our table maybe 15 minutes after we received brunch, without a word and walked away. Literally threw it to the extent that we thought she had tossed garbage onto our table. When we were actually ready an hour later we asked for an ice coffee to go and she made a half assed grab for the ticket to add it, as if she really thought it'd be okay to charge me for an ice coffee after she threw the ticket at us when we were both mid bite. A pretty laughable experience, will NOT sit with her again. Otherwise, the rest of the staff is always very friendly, love to make conversation and want to have a happy morning delivering prompt service. Coffee's always fresh and hot, this place stays busy for a good reason and the wait is always accurate. Staff is always clearly working very hard. Two stars because  blondie, otherwise a five."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast yesterday after reading yelp reviews and I was not disappointed! There were a lot of healthy breakfast choices and it was absolutely delicious! Although a bit on the pricier side, I would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Great spot within walking distance of the resort we are staying at in Scottsdale. Fresh pressed juices and fresh ingredients made for a great breakfast! Belgium waffle  was great! I recommend the millionaires bacon !! It's great with maple syrup and cayenne pepper. Boyfriend had the kale juice and breakfast tacos- he approved! Service was quick and food came fast- they were decently busy- visited on a Friday morning"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $20. Paid $11. Joined First Watch Cafe's email club and they sent me a BOGO entrée coupon just for signing up. Called in my order ahead, they said 15 minutes but it ended up being 30 so I waited near the host stand. This is within walking distance of work and is competitively priced with a Safeway deli sandwich but the place is probably better for a sit down meal rather than take out. The girl working the register was friendly but looked kind of flustered that two take out orders weren't ready by the time the recipient showed up to pay. They apologized for the wait, I tipped because I felt bad that she felt bad."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here for the 2nd time last Sunday. My husband and I received a buy one get one free coupon in the mail. Which is how I got out of making breakfast lol! So thank you First Watch! There was about a 30 minute wait when we got there around 9am. I've kind of expected that there would be a wait. My husband and I got a table outside. He ordered the egg taco dish. I ordered a egg avocado sandwich.   I would come back again. I love the location of this place. It's a great neighborhood spot. The food was good and I like that there are healthier options that taste good. I would prefer coming here than probably IHOP but my favorite brunch spot is still Snooze Am Eatery."}
{"text":"First Watch has a very nice atmosphere and a great array of breakfast options. The avocado toast was very tasty with a perfect consistency, the lemon wedge was a nice added touch as well. I would recommend First Watch to anybody looking for a casual breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Yum!! Excellent coffee, good juice concoctions (love that you can sample them too). I had the BLT Eggs Benedict and my husband had the Works Omelet. The bread was very fresh and the greens crisp. Might be a new post run tradition."}
{"text":"Excellent avocado toast with 2 eggs. A perfect breakfast after a 10 mile trail run at McDowell Mtn -- elevation 3200ft of ascend."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. A bit of a wait on weekends, but free coffee. Love the food, good variety and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and GREAT environment.   My husband and I were here today for lunch. We have been here previously and always had great food. My husband has had many sandwiches- today had the choc chip pancakes. I highly recommend the salads (I always get the Cobb) and soups are always delicious. The avocado toast is AMAZING.   Is a pet friendly spot on their outdoor patio. Today we had our dog with us and the staff went above and beyond even bringing our pup some water!   Very positive experience as always and huge compliment to the staff that work there."}
{"text":"This place is great! Excellent breakfast & sandwich choices, everything is fresh, great GF & health conscious options. Service was great, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First Watch is better than a diner but the excitement stops there. The food was good, the service was good. I had the egg white omelet with onion, green chili and pico on the side. The toast it came with was good but didn't have butter, the fruit was treated and tasted weird.   Put it this way, my grandma would love this place. And I would take her here, but if I want taste bud tantalizing experience this wouldn't be the place.  A-OK is the perfect rating. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was not that great.  I do not know how they make their gravy for turkey sausage gravy and biscuits, it was weird. Not a traditional breakfast gravy. The potatoes had no flavor. The only thing that was somewhat edible were the scrambled eggs. Not going back:  set me back $15.89 including tip."}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty, clean, and service is exceptional! Will definitely recommend and return !"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service. Food was amazing. Superior menu. Quality and healthy ingredients. Excited to have them near me"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time to treat my mom to a nice(health..ierr) type breakfast becuase of her dietary restrictions. I work 3 jobs and rarely have any free time to do anything nice so when I finally get to, I GREATLY appreciate good customer service. Not only was the food great but the customer service was excellent. Everyone was very helpful but wanted to give an extra shout out to Eli who was our server and went above and beyond to make sure my mom and I were taken care of. And YES (by the way..) the FOOD WAS delicious. AMAZING french toast and their skillets are delicious."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab breakfast. We had a good meal with quality ingredients. I had the Veg'd Out Omelet and they happily made it as a scramble for me upon request. My boyfriend ordered the French Toast Monte Cristo. He said it was a unique dish with a lot of different flavors. I also liked that the had flavored coffee creamers at the table.   Our server was very sweet and helpful. We will definitely come back here next year."}
{"text":"I had pumpkin pancakes here last weekend that were amazing.  This was my first visit. I liked the ambiance - it's a lot bigger inside than it looks from the street. Had a bite of my friends Mexican omelet and that was great too. Will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is super personable and sweet! Thank you Ellen for me such a sweet individual! Great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy choices! Finally healthy food!!!!!! Healthy fresh veggie, fruit drinks. Could order all day"}
{"text":"So glad this place has come to my neighborhood! Although there can be a wait, the line moves fast. And once at your table, the service is quick. For a restaurant, their coffee is the bomb, I've had nearly all of their entrees that contain avocado and none disappoint, my favorite is the avocado toast, YUM! My adult kids and other have love as well, definitely a place to stop if you live or are visiting the South Hills!"}
{"text":"I asked for the oatmeal and got an incredible breakfast. It was cooked just right. The service was excellent, the staff was very responsive and the manager very professional. We're coming back again!"}
{"text":"Love coming to eat here when I visit Phoenix.  Had the AB&J Waffle special and an Eggs Benedict.  Both were very good.  Typically have gone early in the morning, between 7/8am so it's never been too busy.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Walked into this place,waited at door to be seated still waiting 20 minutes later no  acknowledgement we were there. We left. Can not rate food but i would guess if you dont want me to eat it cant be good"}
{"text":"Not bad, but service was very slow. Forgot our side of bacon, and the place was a bit too hip, pricy and full of itself for what it is - a basic breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at this location and it was just as great as the peoria location. I decided to try something different this time and got the chikichanga. It was absolutely delicious! The decor was cute and our waitress was outstanding."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot! They have healthy options, not that I have tried them lol. The hash skillet is the best dish! They give plenty of food at a great price, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Very good place for brunches. And you could even join the waitlist before you arrive using Yelp.  Nice atmosphere and wide selection of delicious food."}
{"text":"Had the new fall Pumpkin Pancakes with chicken sausage and eggs.  It was delicious.  My only complaint would be is you only get one Pancake for just under $10 as I think there should be atleast 2 but other than that nothing else to complain about. The food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"If you are into Politics (Hillary Shirts), Religion(servers praying at next table and discussing beliefs so loudly, you can't hear the music), Alternative Lifestyles (do I have to explain this?) and overpriced food (12 bucks for a salad and Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice)...this is your place!  I had a salad, the dressing was way too sweet, I ate about a third of it and boxed the rest.  Our server had scary looking bloodshot eyes, just an observation.  Should have checked the reviews before coming here, ugh."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! I had eggs Benedict BLT style. And it was great. My husband and nice had the breakfast taco's. And the liked it very much. Our waitress was very very friendly. We where sitting outside. There was an older man cleaning the tables and I think he had a bad morning. His face was not very friendly."}
{"text":"First Watch has changed a lot since the last time I've been. As you walk in embrace everything you see and immediately you get the fresh farm with a modern twist feel. I personally love that! Upside down baskets for lampshades, farm doors used as accents, very clean decor. The menu is also taken a major on a makeover. A lot of healthy conscious choices, and some items I'd call eccentric. I went with a classic, 3 egg with chicken sausage(pretty cool), white toast and country potatoes. Awesome! And now that I'm intrigued I'll definitely be going back to expand upon this updated, upgraded gem!"}
{"text":"This is only the 2nd time I have been here.  The first time the pancakes were very heavy but this time was a whole different story.  We arrived about 12:45 pm.  I wanted to make sure they use fresh eggs they crack as some joints use the egg mixture which is not real healthy.  They said they usually use the egg mixture but patrons can substitute fresh eggs to crack.  So since they did not have the omelette I wanted on the list I created my own, be advise they make their omelettes different than most.  The ingredients is not included with the eggs but rather put on top of the eggs and folded over.  I ordered a cracked egg omelette with spinach, mushrooms, onions, and cheese with sour cream and fresh greens on the side.  The mushrooms and onions were slightly grilled.  It tasted very good with muffin on the side.  I also had some of my friend's pancakes let me tell you what a difference they were light and airy.  They are as big as the plate so one is usually enough for my friend and I.  Since they did not have any decaf green tea I opted for the decaf coffee which was very good.  Overall very good breakfast. price for two breakfasts, the two drinks and one juice was $25.00.  I would come back just for the pancakes.  Bravo!!!  I sure wish the wait staff would have name tags though so we can greet them accordingly."}
{"text":"Nice quaint place. Designed well inside.  The breakfast omelette with goat cheese and salad on the side was pretty darn tasty. The wait staff was a little slow as I had to go and get her a few times to refill my coffee cup.  But all and all nice location for breakfast joint."}
{"text":"The organic selection of food is pretty good,   I came in for a birthday with some friends, but the waitress refused to give us the free meal saying we needed a coupon, we explained we never received the coupon even though we have received numerous email from corporate.  They refused to accommodate us even after we spoke to the manager who was really rude.  We had our license but still no go.  Maybe they shouldn't advertise they give free meals on Birthdays when in fact they do not"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and found the food to be OK.  But this was the best visit yet.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive.  Maybe it was so good because I had lunch with my daughter and great grand daughter.  Had the 2 for you, reuben sandwich and cob salad, both good.  Great Grand Daughter had a fruit boy (she is a healthy eater) and whatever she could poach from the plates of the adults."}
{"text":"I've been to first watch a couple times and I personally don't think it's anything special that you can't make at home. It's a chain breakfast place that is always crowded (so that shows most people like it). I think that the flavor isn't special and it doesn't leave me wanting more or feeling satisfied.   Don't get me wrong, the price is right and the food is good, I just have had way better. It's a greet place for families and young kids so that is a big positive for families too."}
{"text":"Found this spot on our back to Wisconsin. Absolutely delicious! I had the Bacado with a Kale Tonic. They were both amazing, we ended up ordering two more for our children, ages 6&7 and they absolutely loved it as well. We need one of these places in Wisconsin! I will be returning when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfasts but a great place to go to when you want a quick breakfast bite. Enjoy fresh fruit and decent pancakes and many other menu items."}
{"text":"Great decor, cozy, quick and impeccable service. The Morning Sunrise was delicious and the elevation egg sandwich definitely hit the spot! Definitely recommend hitting First Watch for breakfast or lunch or both!"}
{"text":"The AM Superfoods Bowl is my new addiction, and sadly only seasonal. My husband loves the chickichanga. So  this is our 3rd week in a row!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Tri-Athletic was great! My wife Denisse and I really enjoyed our healthy options and the place had an uber cool layout. Exposed Hardwood tables  and comfy seating!!"}
{"text":"I love First Watch and have been going to them for years. The food is always so good and the service is always exceptional! I recommend it all the time and today was excited to share this new location with friends. Unfortunately, it was the worst service any of us have had. Desma was rude, unfamiliar with the menu and lacked in customer service. She over charged me for my meal but I was so irritated with her, I just dealt with it. Sorely disappointed in this location and will not  be coming back!"}
{"text":"\"OK\" is the best I can do. Food is good though they seem to be using small size eggs not large. Service is SLOW and that is on a weekday when there were 5 servers we saw and only 5 tables occupied. We were on the verge of getting up to leave when someone finally came to our table--she said she had been in the office--we suspect it was the rest room. Still took a long time to get our food. We liked food and service much better when it was The Good Egg. We have not seen Keith since it changed hands. He was a top notch server even on a weekend when inside and patio were full. They now charge extra to substitute fruit for the potatoes. I had the spuds and they were lackluster and dry. I prefer to butter my own toast but they can't seem to understand \"do not butter the toast, bring it unbuttered and bring me butter on the side\" and I have told them that 3 times! We were glad to see the \"country\" decor of the old GE disappear and the new decor was fine. Then they changed ownership and had to be trendy. It's ok but the chairs are still uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Have been there 4 times since it opened. Service mediocre. Eggs are very small. Food is pricey and nothing special so no reason to go there again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch spot with local produce they recently changed out this turkey sausage which was kind of a bummer but otherwise great!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, was told to seat myself, not a problem at all had a nice seat at a well placed table since it was earlier in the morning and hardly anyone was there. I wasn't greeted by my server for 6-8 minutes, where she immediately gave me coffee (decaf), a great start to the morning, however it the coffee was hardly hot, and tasted like it had been mixed with a lot of water. Of course I know decaf is a little different than regular, but this was hardly resembling the taste of coffee. After another 8-12 minutes, my server came over again to see if I wanted to order and I got the Market hash, and asked for water, as she had not offered it to me or brought it over for the last nearly 20 minutes. She got it right over and within the next 10 minutes my food was out. It was absolutely delicious and i loved it! great seasonings, flavor and combination of veggies and eggs, wonderful temperature I almost didn't even need salt or pepper. The cheeses worked great with the dish. Somewhere in the middle of my eating my server came over (as some one else had dropped off my food) and dropped the check. If you're looking for good food go here, good service, I'm sure there are better options."}
{"text":"Great food - locally sourced and fresh.  Service is great.  The wait for a table can be long at times but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend for the first time and we loved it! The waitress was nice and attentive. Also, she gave us good recommendations(the millions bacon is literally heaven served on a plate). My breakfast sandwich was fresh and filled me up plenty! We were seated quickly and offered coffee right away! The place was nice, neat, and clean! I would definitely recommend to someone who is looking for a semi healthier route for a breakfast date!"}
{"text":"'First Watch' is truly a godsend!  We have been coming here weekly for years, and have consistently obtained excellent, attentive service and food.  We make the drive from North Olmsted when we want to sit down and have a real breakfast, instead of just grabbing a quick bagel at Einstein's or Bruegger's.  Just like your typical diner or 'family restaurant', the prices are fair, and the portions plentiful.  This place really does have a local, family owned warm atmosphere, and the friendly competent servers always know how to cater to our finicky child as well.  In addition, it's the small touches that speak volumes, such as the clean bathrooms, free coffee in the waiting area, and the nice variety of flavored coffee creamers and jellies available.  This most excellent place never fails to put a smile on my face, and this comes from a stickler for quality (that's ME), no less!"}
{"text":"I have been patronizing 'FirstWatch' for years, both the Westlake and the Rocky River locations.  The breakfast is very good, with fresh tasting omelettes (I love their 'Greek Fetish' omelette), excellent fluffy pancakes (carrot pancakes are scrumptious) and waffles, and good lunch choices to boot.  The servers are friendly and dedicated as well, and many of us know each other on a first name basis.  The decor is akin to a nice family restaurant or higher end diner, with tables and booths.  I love the ample parking in the nearby garage and/or parking lot too.  'FirstWatch' is a welcome joy to my selection of the most favorite places to go to for a good, satisfying breakfast!    UPDATE July 2014:  I have to reduce my previous 5-star rating to 3 stars!  Don't EVER go there on a Sunday morning, unless you enjoy waiting half an hour to an hour to get served!  We (party of 2) waited for 45 minutes, then sat down and waited another 15 minutes for our food!  A grand total of ONE HOUR between the time we walked in, and the time we got our breakfast!  NO breakfast is worth a 1 hour wait, especially with an 8 year old hungry kid in tow!  And to make matters worse, the place is packed with selfish, egotistical local SNOBS who take their sweet time eating, then hanging out as if at a cafe, instead of finishing their meals at a normal pace, then leaving to make room for others!  So, to sum things up, it's OK to go there on weekdays, but on Sunday mornings... FUHGEDDABOUDIT!  UPDATE October 2015:  They have a newer, more updated and 'upscale' menu now (don't like it as much), and they no longer put a jelly carousel on the table.  I liked the old First Watch a LOT better, since I had a choice of several jellies at my disposal.  Now I have to ask to see if they have the various flavors I like (and that they had).  I asked for grape, and they only had 'sugar-free' grape, which I will not imbibe because it tastes terrible and has artificial sweeteners.  Lastly, their pumpkin pancakes taste a bit 'off' (IHOP blows them away), and the prices have gone UP!  Are they trying to cater to only upper middle class Westlake now?  It sure feels that way!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place.  We're new to town and have not had much luck finding good food.  The expensive places have been overpriced, pretentious, and not good; and the cheap places have been greasy, low class, and not good.  First Watch is a breath of freshness!  Our meals were expertly made, with fresh and good quality ingredients.  The service was fabulous!!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! I've gone on weekday mornings and there was never a wait. Staff is super nice and the food is always great! They have fun options and great healthy options as well!"}
{"text":"First Watch is my first encounter with a chain breakfast joint that doesn't have golden arches or a king in its visual library.  As breakfast goes, I find First Watch okay though fairly uninspired.  My biggest disappointment is their home fries-  always on the bland side and often tepid. They seem like something that you bring home frozen from a grocery store. Maybe I'm just not getting it.  But we know its hard to screw up breakfast too royally and when you are hungry, FirstWatch still satisfies."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! We had a classic eggs Benedict, French Toast and millionaire bacon. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. My only complaint would be the server seemed a little lost and a bit inattentive. We never received a refill for the glass water bottle that they leave at the table. And when asking her questions on what she would recommend she really didn't have much to offer, her responses were sort of like 'I mean if that's what you like then sure it's good' i don't know maybe breakfast food isn't really her thing. Otherwise the staff was really friendly. We waited nearly an hour, but i expect that for any great breakfast place on a Sat/Sun mid morning. I'll definitely be back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I had the French toast. Was made in less than 5 minutes. Was great.the old fashion milk bottle fill with water put a smile on my face. For one the water was cold and clear. Big plus.as a little kid.i had drank milk out of that bottle. The place was nice and clean. Bath room clean but not kept up.was 25 bucks for 2 people."}
{"text":"The coffee was fantastic and the service was great. We had two orders of the eggs Benedict which were also great besides the fact that the poached eggs were much over cooked. Upon cutting into the eggs, no yolk seeped down the English muffin, like most Benedict dishes do. This was disappointing but overall a great experience"}
{"text":"We had a good meal. Our sever was friendly, but was always stopping to check his phone before he went inside...we were seated outside.  Loved the outdoor seating but inside seemed humid and the decor was , blah.  We have frequented the Cranberry location as well as Virginia and Indy.  This is the worst ambiance.  Also disappointed hat the menu was different. No fruit crepes. Our meals were good but average. Will travel t o Cranberry next time."}
{"text":"My first experience was awesome. I had an amazing server named Shannon. She offered me avocado toast and kale tonic after I told her I was a vegetarian. I was highly satisfied with the taste, presentation and service. I will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast.  One of the best in Phoenix.  It will be hard for us to choose between First Watch and Matt's Big Breakfast in the future.  Don't leave without trying the \"Million dollar bacon\".  The Huevos Rancheros were not to be missed, and the bean slaw with them was an unexpected bonus.  Not bad grits either.  Super way to start any day!"}
{"text":"Beautiful design awful service and food.  Went yesterday for brunch. What a disaster . The worst service ever.  Our coffee was served cold ( in a pot placed on the table ), waiter never came by to check on us, could not get his attention . We both ordered poached eggs with wheat toast no potatoes , side of fruit.  After 30 minutes no food! Not once did the waiter stop by, check on us , refill the cold coffee or explain the delay. When I finally got the bus boy to find our waiter , the waiter testily told us \"the food will be served when ready!\" Then the food arrives . No toast DOUBLE POTATOES.  WTF! When I flag the waiter down again, he tells us for the first time that there is no toast because the toaster caught fire ! So they gave us extra potatoes . Another WTF moment . Ever tried to eat poached eggs with no toast :  egg soup !  We could not wait to leave. Never returning"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and the food has always been excellent as well as the service. Today our server, Ruby, was especially kind and patient with my mother today and carried out all of her requests speedily and kindly. She answered all of our questions and when my father realized he couldn't eat the toast she had brought due to his illness, she promptly brought out another side that he thoroughly enjoyed. The food (three dishes) came out within 10-15 minutes and was delicious, not to mention reasonably priced. Being a health-conscious woman, I really appreciate the calories being listed on the menu so that I can be aware of what I'm consuming. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with the service for having a party of 21 (7 kids)!  Although this is part of a chain, the food was exceptionally good.  Our server was very sweet, patient and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Ive been 4 times it think last time was yesterday....  OK so the Good........some good creative menu choices....ah a Fajitas crepe was interesting....

{"text":"Do you like fantastic food? Do you like amazing service? Are you human?? DO YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY???  If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions get your butt over here before 2:30(that's when they close) and try ANYTHING at all.  My all time favourite dish is the Chicken Chimichurri Hash. It's new, and if you are too, you'd better order it. Oh the pesto, the sunflower seeds in the bread, THE GINGER IN THE AÇAÍ DRINK.  I just can't stress enough how important it is you for you eat here.  If I lived here I would eat here every day.  This restaurant is actually so good it makes me question in the 125°F summers are really that bad. (They are).   When you come in ask for Miguel, he's one of the managers and a great guy. Tell Miguel he's beautiful and kiss all the chefs, then enjoy your food and your life."}
{"text":"So good we went two days in a row! We were visiting from out of town and decided to check this place out. So fresh, ideal portions, and friendly staff. Really good healthy options as well."}
{"text":"Had the Chickichanga and it was PERFECT!!! Everyone was soooo nice!   Clean and brilliant breakfast atmosphere!  Great coffee and fast service!  Give it a try, menu is versatile with many healthy choices! Chickichanga is not one of them, but worth every calorie :D"}
{"text":"Food is great,  I've been here 4 or 5 times always delicious.  Love the omelets and the protein bowl.  However!  The wait staff is very slow.  Never refilling drinks with out asking.  Body language and tone are very rude and disrespectful.  This is from multiple waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"Our server Eli was soooo amazing!! It was the best experience I have ever had at a restaurant. He recommended the chikichanga and we were in heaven! He was so polite and attentive. He put our order in and our food was out. Our drinks were always filled and clutter was removed asap. I think I have found my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. My wife and I were vacationing on Mesa and found this jewel of a restaurant. Staff was super friendly, food was great and prices reasonable. So good we ate here both mornings we were in Mesa."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with healthy brunch options? You can't! The service varies from slightly slow to super fast depending on the time you arrive due to its popularity and small size. Everything is delicious. If you've been to other local locations you will most likely receive the same menu. If you haven't been in a few years the menu has changed but favorites like the Trifecta are still around. Always look at the chalkboard when you walk in for daily specials. If the millionaire's bacon is offered, you should get it. It is a sweet piece of bacon heaven. The decor is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"I noticed First Watch on yelp, and was eager to try it.  I really like things like quinoa and good oatmeal and freshly made juice.  I decided to try the quinoa breakfast bowl.  It includes Italian sausage, which I did not want but figured I could just not eat those pieces. There are also two eggs on top and olive oil.  I actually didn't care for it. I didn't eat the sausage, but the olive oil seemed unnecessary and left an oily feel in my mouth for 30 minutes or so.  The mushrooms and tomatos were good though.  I would ask to hold the sausage and olive oil.  My companion had the traditional breakfast which included a blueberry pancake and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The coffee was also good, but in spite of them leaving the carafe at the table there is not enough in the pot to refill two cups.  The space is nice, and other options on the menu sound good and I look forward to trying them.  I would like to see some nutrition facts on the menu, especially for the items in the \"Healthy\" category."}
{"text":"I've been writing reviews like crazy about place I've taken my mom when she was in town, and here's another one.  Firs time here with my mom and wife, and everything was great tasting. I can't say it's our favorite breakfast place, but it was good enough that we'd come back. I think the prices were a bit high, but the food was good. Can't really think of anything else to say..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Such friendly people who know and love the menu, and are happy to recommend something.  The food, well presented, well cooked and beautifully composed. Someone who knows good food and how to combine them had a hand in this menu. I love their plates, too.   They have a full juice bar, healthy and creative options as well as indulgences.  The service, top notch. They are subtle but present, and not intrusive.   You won't be disappointed in this place!  The price, reasonable and good value."}
{"text":"This is the second First Watch location I've been too - and it's just as fabulous! The service was excellent and I love a place that understands the importance of using Fresh food. It's kinda crazy that this is often the exception and not the norm. Would highly recommend this chain of restaurants for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"More like 3 1/2 stars and service and food were fine but never like to leave a breakfast place still hungry.  Kind of pricey for the amount of food. Big plates but kind of skimpy on what was on the plate."}
{"text":"First Watch was so delicious and much needed after 2 days of eating only fried food. We arrived at about 9:30am and were immediately seated. My companions ordered the Fruity Chicken Salad and the Key West Crepe. Both of their dishes looked quite good. I ordered the Floridian French Toast, which was awesome! Sourdough toast, topped with wheat germ and tons of kiwi, strawberries and bananas. So delicious! This is the healthy alternative to IHOP or Denny's. Only problem is the entrance area can get packed with people waiting to be seated and those waiting to pay."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people really rave about the breakfast at First Watch, but I think it's pretty mediocre, serviceable at best. It's a chain and it feels like a chain.   The decor at this particular location reminds me of a continental breakfast lounge at a hotel. I think the restaurant tries to go for a Florida Keys vibe but actually hits more accurately on a Florida retirement home vibe. Fine if that is your thing. It's not really mine.  I've never strayed far from the egg dishes and they are just fine. An omelette is an omelette is an omelette. Portions are decent so if you're looking to stuff your face you can.  What I think is strangest about First Watch is they way they serve the coffee. They bring a carafe to the table, which is fine, but I have never received a carafe that was more than maybe 1/2 full. And I know the carafe is on the table so heavy coffee drinkers like me aren't constantly bothering the waitress for more coffee, but once that 1/2 carafe is drained, I find myself bugging the waitress for more. Counterintuitive! Bring me a full carafe! In fact bring me two.  The service is also kind of weird here, like they can't wait for you to leave. That might just be because I drink so damn much of their coffee, though."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE breakfast place at home! It makes coming home from college so much more enjoyable! This is my friends and I's go-to morning hangout place. It's so cozy and friendly! They hire the best staff, who are always working hard and trying to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. Their coffee is to die for! I like it better than Starbucks or Dunkin. A few of my favorite dishes are: Elevated Egg Sandwich, Steel Cut Oatmeal, Avocado Toast, and Cinnamon Roll Waffle. These pictures are all from different experiences, but needless to say, I'm here often!"}
{"text":"Took my team here for breakfast.  Lots of breakfast options but I found food to be somewhat bland or generic in flavor, and heavy.  Not well prepared food for taste either (tomatoes not ripe, huge asparagus pieces)."}
{"text":"I always LOVE coming here. Fantastic breakfast food, nice atmosphere, clean and family friendly. My favorite is the farmhouse skillet-- love the cheesy potatoes with bacon, avocado, and over easy eggs on top! I inhale my food every time we go!"}
{"text":"Went as a group of 3 and all had superior meals.  I had the Elevated Egg sandwich and my guests had the turkey club and the open faced chicken salad sandwich.  All were top quality and nothing was left on the plates. Fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice were nice drink complements. Service was prompt and prices reasonable. Good for Bridgeville!"}
{"text":"I've been to First Watch quite a few times, but visited this location for the first time this past Saturday. We arrived around 9:30am and it was (not surprisingly) packed. We waited about 30 minutes for a party of four. I have no problem waiting, but I do wish they had a better waiting area. The front area where to check in, wait for a table, and pay your bill is extremely congested. I watched a poor women try and fail to take different paths just to pay her bill until she finally gave up and pulled out cash to leave at the table.       The food has always been outstanding no matter what location I've been to. The potatoes and the bread they use for toast are hands down the best part of any meal. Their coffee is also some of the best I've tasted, and I love that they have some out at the front to drink while you wait.       My only complaint would be the time it took for our food to come out. I recognize that it was a busy time, but when two out of four meals comes out with the rest not following for a good 10 minutes, followed by an order of pancakes another five minutes later, I think that's a little absurd. The waitress' comment of \"that's what you get here, the food comes out when it comes out\" did not help the matter much.       Overall, great food but long wait times and not the best service I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food was as expected. Younger blonde female server was very attentive but not overly friendly. Perfect blend in the food industry.    Come for a good breakfast with a great atmosphere and phenomenal service.   Really can't rate this place any higher solely based on their level of attentiveness and sincerity."}
{"text":"First time come here yesterday and I have to say I'm officially obsessed. I had their multigrain banana crunch pancakes as well as their blueberry. These things were divine. If you ever want a healthier option for breakfast or lunch, head over to this spot! It's affordable, the decor is casual and welcoming, and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Fresh food, attentive staff and boy is it fast!  I like the skillets and they'll sub out my toast for fruit, which is nice.  I never feel like I ate heavy, sticky, icky food when I leave and I like that.  Every single employee you encounter interacts with you with a big ol' smile on their face.  There is ONE wait person who is a little ditzy and I try to avoid her like the plague, but overall I am very impressed with this place.  Not a greasy diner, no siree!  Tasty!  I'd eat lunch here sometime too but their gluten free lunch options are just about non-existent.  I wish they'd change that."}
{"text":"We have been to and enjoyed several locations. This one was subpar. The biscuits and gravy was simply not as good. The turkey sausages my wife had were bland as tasteless. We were brought the check right after our breakfast came. Kind of like the old fashioned lunch counter. This was a real disappointment, and not at all what we've come to expect from First Watch."}
{"text":"We're fans.  What a great place for breakfast or brunch! We love breakfast foods and this place has such a variety of options. They even have a seasonal menu. We had coffee, which was not bitter like some places, and a Morning Meditation fresh squeezed juice to start. Not only was my husbands juice beautiful to look at, it tasted great. A nice mix of orange, lemon, turmeric, ginger, agave and beet. Not too sweet, not too spicy.  We also had to try the Millionaires Bacon which featured some cayenne, maple syrup and brown sugar. Bacon, made even better! I decided to order from the Summer menu and went with the Heirloom tomato and burata toast. What a light, great tasting summer breakfast item.  I loved it, except I think it would be even better served at room temperature instead of how cold it was. The tomatoes would have been even more flavorful that way. My husband had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  Wow, I had to sneak a bite.  You could really taste that delicious lemon flavor, even without any of the lemon curd that was on the top.  The pancakes were so light and fluffy. Delicious.  We had great service but unfortunately we have found yet another place that doesn't offer a military discount.  We will be back though. Great food, great variety."}
{"text":"There are several locations in the valley but this has a local and family owned vibe to it. The employees are always friendly and they are always recognizable as they have little to no turnover. Good coffee and really good portion sizes on their food. I've mainly stuck to their breakfast menu and highly recommend the Chicichanga as it is full of flavor and pretty unique. They have a rotating seasonal menu that mixes things up a bit."}
{"text":"Took a while to get a table, very busy. But worth the wait. I ordered the Parma skillet hash, so delicious. This is the fourth First Watch I've been to and this one made it the best. I always want to try something else on the menu, but I always get this, it's my favorite.   Ian was our server and he was quick, caring and thought of everything."}
{"text":"I had the cinnamon roll waffle...dang!! That was good. Definitely on the sweeter side but fk'ing fantastic!!  This is probably the best breakfast spot I've been to. I'm should be on your destination list."}
{"text":"First watch is great spot for breakfast a bit pricey excellent selection. I would highly recommend it if your wallet doesn't quiver with high priced fare."}
{"text":"Been to several locations in the valley & find they are all consistent in wonderful service as well as really delicious food! Quality, Quick & Consistent is a trifecta for a chain restaruant!!!"}
{"text":"was so happy when First Watch opened on the east side. Their breakfasts are amazing and so is their service. This time I had the power wrap and wow was it delicious. I highly recommend First Watch. Never had a bad meal or bad service"}
{"text":"I like First Watch, their not your typical breakfast place.  I've eaten at First Watch before when I lived in Phoenix, so I was thrilled to see that they were here.  I arrived at 7 AM on the nose and there were already people seated. I was greeted by the hostess and seated right away and offered coffee and water.  I love the ambiance here more then I love the food. That doesn't mean the food is bad. It's actually really good. BUT, it's a little much for me on their menu, and I wasn't looking to pig out for breakfast as much as I was here to get a good hearty meal.  After reviewing the menu, I stuck with two eggs over medium, hash browns with cinnamon raisin bread.  When the food came out, I forgot just how beautiful and tasty it was here.  (this is what happens when you have had one too many coney island breakfasts.  *cough*)  Anyways, the food and coffee were phenomenal.  Totally on point and hit the spot. I don't know what they do to their hash browns, but they are absolutely delicious.  Coffee was really good as well, and I took a cup to go for the road.  Overall, I really love first watch. totally delicious, worth every penny. I will continue eating here as long as I know one is nearby. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"So, I wanted something to eat this morning, and the thought of coming made me decide to go out to eat instead. I'm tired of blowing up the kitchen, so I decided to come here instead.  This place is located off the service drive of I-17, smushed in between some hotels and next door to the outback steakhouse.  When I arrived, the parking lot looked kind of full, and I thought \"oh great, there's going to be a wait-what did I get myself into?\"  Fortunately, I was seated right away.  The host was friendly and outgoing, and the waitress gave me a menu and offered me some drinks.  I reviewed the menu and decided to order the Cinnamon raisin french toast, and let me tell you, it was delicious!  Three pieces of french toast, with some home made jelly jam tasted awesome!  The place is cutely decorated, with bench style seating, and there's more then enough places to sit.  I was thrilled that I didn't have a wait on a Saturday morning shortly before 10AM, because as you know, breakfast places can be packed at times like this.  They also have a lunch menu as well, which seemed really appetizing.  Bathrooms were clean, and overall, it was a really good experience.  Prices were fair, as my french toast only cost me $7.53 after tax!  I see myself coming back in the future, and this place is definitely worth a try if your in the area for breakfast or lunch.  I think they close at 3PM, so make sure you get there earlier in the day."}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast along McKnight Road. There are so many chain restaruants & fast casual places so this place was a real sigh of relief. It is a little pricey compared to surrounding areas, but you really are paying for quality & service. The interior is upscale/modern with rustic decor, ambience is casual. They have outdoor seating as well. I ordered Eggs Florentine Benedict  & it was SO fresh tasting. They used ciabatta bread instead of an English muffin which was very pleasing. Side of lightly dressed greens helped the meal to not be so heavy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the drive back to San Diego.  We wanted something light before the drive.  Lots of Healthy options, I got the fresh fruit crepes with yogurt on top, and side of granola.  My friend got the turkey, feta, egg white omelette.  Both were very good, fruit was fresh, and tasty. We both wanted a huge greasy breakfast, but we were very pleased with our healthy alternative."}
{"text":"I usually go to a different first watch but tried this one and was so dissappointed. The food was great as always but I had the worst service I've ever had and for the first time in my life did not leave a tip. Our server Jojo forgot to put our order in until 20 minutes after we ordered, then when we asked how much longer it would be by having to flag her down since she never came back she said she would check and never reappeared. Someone else brought us our food 45 minutes after we ordered, and she only came back to drop the check off without asking how the food was or apologizing. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I love this place, you can always count on it for some great food at a great prices. The Tri-athlete omelet is the best."}
{"text":"Two words: Avocado Toast. It's great here - on thick, fresh, multigrain bread, with plenty of fresh smashed avocado, and a side of lemon. Two fried eggs made it all the better. Bringing a pot of coffee to the table is a nice touch, and the staff is very nice. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is delicious! Came here for breakfast this morning with my boyfriend, our bellies have never been so satisfied. I got the traditional (everything came out just like i wanted) & my bf got the eggs benedict. We also got a plain pancake to share because we couldn't help ourselves!   Clean, cute, friendly environment w/ generous portions. Full carafe of coffee 2 share, and water upon request (yay water saving!). Service was great as well. We came around 8:30, was mega packed when we left around 9:30. I suggest getting here early on a Saturday. Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm going to review a First Watch, but we have had such amazing experiences at this one that I have to.   I've eaten here a few times and both times they've been so nice to us and amazing with our kids. Each time they've been quick about getting some food or drink for the kids and they've even played and talked to them. The decor inside the restaurant is modern and new and the food has been great. Most other First Watch's I've been to have dirty and old, not this one. I highly recommend, these people really enjoy their jobs and you can tell."}
{"text":"Found this place during a 30+ min wait at a another restaurant just up the road...getting hangry, we looked on Yelp for another close-by breakfast joint and was pleasantly surprised how awesome First Watch is!  First off, the inside of the restaurant still has that \"new car\" feel where everything from the decor to the utensils is clean and not dingy or worn out. Both times I have been here (we went back within a week) the hash browns are better than most diners as they not only put onions in there, but they caramelize them so they have a slight burnt taste to them...very yummy! The eggs are also plentiful and I don't believe they charge extra for egg whites, a huge plus!  I only have 2 very minor complaints: 1. They have really good coffee that isn't bitter or too acidic, but they almost ruin it with those little International Delight coffee creamers (vanilla, hazelnut and half and half)...would like to see real half and half served. 2. The butter on toast has an interesting appearance to it. While it taste good, it has the color and texture of non-fat butter as it doesn't really melt, it kind of just sits there, on the bread.  But other than that, glad we found this place and will definitely be one of our regular go-to breakfast spots in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Management was very responsive to our previous  concerns and comments. Convinced us to try again and not disappointed at all this time. I had the power wrap and it was full of flavor and very healthy. We have family in town and they thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Happy to report we'll be back. :-). Our server Katie was very nice and on top of it."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but we went to first watch about an hour ago and experienced the same problem we always have there. We waited a mere 10 minutes for a table. That's great considering it was busy. My problem with First Watch is the glassware is always Dirty when we go there. I went to the host and told him the dishes were dirty and we would be leaving and his response was \"ok, sorry. Have a good day\" we've had this problem before and just drank from to-go cups, but if the glassware is dirty and has food particles all over it then the plates and silverware does too. The servers are great there. And the food is great, too. But dirty plates and glassware is a deal breaker for me. And the fact that the host didn't want to solve problem and acted like it was a normal complaint."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with a delicious menu!  Had the BLT eggs Benedict and I would order it again in a heartbeat! Service was very friendly and quick, great family friendly restaurant! So happy to see how many First Watch's are popping up over the valley, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Good menu but service was beyond slow, dirty tables weren't being cleaned and there was a 30 min wait. Servers strolled around like they were taking a walk through the park. Food took 30+ min to come out, pancake came out cold and with diced veggies from another dish on it. Won't ever go back"}
{"text":"Healthy breakfasts!! Great coffee great menu selection and lots of windows but the best part is they totally rearranged a menu item for me. I ordered quinoa with chicken, scrambled egg whites, tomato, black beans which is not on the menu but they made it for me anyway!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service is great.   Multi grain pancake was light and fluffy and the pork sausage links have a mild but full flavor.   Have been here three times in two weeks. :)"}
{"text":"First Watch never fails to disappoint. The food is amazing and the ambiance is really relaxed and down to earth. I love the farm fresh feel and everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great service the staff all have great smiles.  Oatmeal and turkey sausage links with black coffee.  The pecans and cranberries make the oatmeal tasty"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!! We had salmon frittata and pancakes. Their banana granola pancake is a must, it is so fluffy, crunchy with granola, and bananas add nice texture and give a deep flavor. I would prefer salmon on top of the frittata but they serve it cooked inside the frittata, but other than that it was good too. They use locally grown fresh products, Staff is very kind and friendly. Place is big so even though it was crowded it wasn't laud or noisy. It is a beautiful place for a beautiful morning."}
{"text":"CINDY gave careful and attentive service that I will never forget. The food was well priced and the taste was what you would expect from a California-style, farm-fresh ingredients-based diner. We had the Tacos and BLT Benedict. Both were good. They have a special, seasonal menu that gets prominently advertised on the wall and separate menu. But I would come back in a heartbeat if i was promised CINDY would be my waitress."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location and it was the first time we've been to First Watch since we're from out of town. We went last Friday, the day after Thanksgiving around 10am. The wait was only 10 minuets. We sat outside in the warm sun and it felt wonderful!   My husband has the vegetable omelette with potatoes and he said it was very good. I had the eggs with avocado toast and sliced tomatoes. It was DELICIOUS! The toast was thick, but light and tender and the eggs were PERFECTLY cooked!   The coffee was served in large, thick mugs and the carafe with extra coffee was left on the table as well as a water pitcher. The service was good too."}
{"text":"Great food and nice servers! Food takes forever to get to your table!  Been here a few times and always a long wait for your food to arrive!  We enjoy the selection and ingredients.  If you're hungry eat something before you go and bring patience along as well."}
{"text":"Such a cute brunch place and so glad they decided to open this location! The food was awesome!!! We had the egg bene, chichichanga, and shared a million dollar bacon and biscuits and gravy! The chichichanga was great! Such good flavors. The egg bene was alright, nothing to complain about but nothing to also rave about. Very normal, yet fresh. The million dollar bacon has great flavor although I do wish that it was a thicker cut of bacon, but that's just my opinion. The biscuits and gravy was super delicious and the gravy is yummy! Next time we'll have to try the sweet stuff, cause we mostly got savory stuff! We also got fresh squeezed orange juice which was great, and some carrot chai tea drink."}
{"text":"similarly to the other two recent reviews, this place continues to let me down. like another yelper stated, it always sounds like a good idea, but usually isn't. i just left for lunch with my fiancé and parents and i'll give a brief explanation of our (poor) experience.   we walked in and my mom told a women with yellow/ orange peroxide hair that we were a party of 4. nothing happened. we continue waiting patiently since my parents ran into friends. another woman, with short brown hair and glasses, asks if we have been helped. at this point, 3 other customers had walked in and were also waiting, we all responded with no. this woman is either new or slow or both and looked at all of us like we had 3 heads. this woman then takes us over to a table that was only set for 2, had 2 chairs (the other two were on the same side about 5 feet from the table) with a menu on the ground as well as food. i told her that we were a party of 4 and would need two more settings. instead of saying that she would go get them, she gave me an extreme attitude and said the tables are always set for 2. i quickly said okay and are we supposed to use the menu off the ground over by the random chairs that are meant for our table too?  we then order our food (a salad, omelette, wrap and sandwich). the wait was at least 35 minutes. the food is finally brought out except for my fiancés roast beef sandwich. we wait, 5, 10 minutes. he had also order the millionaires bacon, which they brought out alone. the food finally comes out about 12 minutes later, no apology, nothing. i can't remember the waitresses name but she was an attractive black woman, who unfortunately should consider an industry other than service. we sat with our water empty for the majority of our lunch. i can't say i will be back and that's absolutely 100% due to the service. it is ALWAYS like this. the food has always been fine, never super fresh like they promise, but it's cheap and a chain so what do you expect.   a word of advice, take as much pride as you do in your food as you do with your staff."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see that this had turned into a first watch and expected a great meal. Unfortunately the food and service is not even close to that of first watch. It's really hard to mess up breakfast but they managed to do it. And service was slow and inadequate. It's best to stick to the Thomas Rd location."}
{"text":"My experience at first watch was nothing but amazing , My server Justin was nothing but friendly and bubbly he definitely made the experience that much more. The food was out of this world, nothing short of delicious and got to me fast. I would definitely recommend it to others and will be making it a go to place from now on for myself and my family!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved to the area and tried this place upon recommendation. My younger sister raved about this place.... and it was a absolute LET DOWN!! We went with a family of five. The hostess and other staff seem incompetent of their jobs. They were calling names from the wait list in a voice barely above a whisper causing people to miss their reservation and cause confusion. It's crowded and no where to sit while waiting. When we were taken back to our table, the floors were absolutely horrendous. Filled with food scrapes and garbage. Our table top wasn't very clean and cup stains all over. I ordered eggs Benedict which is a regular order for me. It was honestly the worst eggs Benedict I've had. My side of potatoes came with a hair cooked into the potato. My brothers fruit came with another hair in it.  Every other dish that came out was cold like it had been sitting around all day. Putting aside all the filth, and even if TWO of our dishes hadn't had hair.... the quality of food is mediocre. I suggest going somewhere with experienced staff, good hygiene and quality warm food."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a quick, wholesome lunch without breaking the bank. Their Kale Tonic is . Great daily soups. Delicious salads. The entire menu boats of some healthy and delicious food items."}
{"text":"Good place!!! The place is nice and spacious. The menus offer good options. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but no alcohol. Good service, rustic decor, lots of options--healthy and not-so-healthy menu items. Can usually book a reservation online, but prepare to wait for a few minutes if you go during peak hours."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat, food was great. I had the eggs benedict and had a special request to add spinach to it. They said no problem.  Was very good.  Portions just right. Very good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place every weekend for the past 3 weeks. The food is exceptional! So flavorful! It can be hard to decide what to order though, everything looks so tasty! The staff is always friendly and helpful too! Great atmosphere to bring friends and family to have a lovely breakfast and chat!"}
{"text":"For a quick, reasonably priced breakfast, this place is pretty good. Sometimes my meal is better than other times, so I think it depends who is in the kitchen. But the service has always been pretty good. And the coffee is fresh.  My recommendation is to order what the daily special is. It's usually pretty good... and fresh."}
{"text":"I know plenty of people love this place but I will lay out the truth so it's out there. The food is fresh, I'll give it that, fresh toast, fruit, eggs not cooked in butter or lard, squeezed juice, but does that matter at all if the wait to get in is at minimum a half hour (at best), the wait staff is slow and barely awake and the lobby is so packed that if you sit in one of their chairs and there are only a dozen people there that someone is practically stepping on you? I had a meal here in hopes of it being good, place is always packed, and I review a lot of restaurants and live by \"packed is good\" but this is \"packed is okay\" and the rating is lower because of the experience."}
{"text":"I like this place - breakfast is good, lunch too. Reasonable, good service and solid food."}
{"text":"Ive been here a handful of times and food and service is always good. There's nothing special about their food selections-- everything is traditional and simple. I really do like this place if i'm looking for a fast and healthy bfast. and best of all, everything is less than $10."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. A lot of choices for breakfast. Different from other breakfast place."}
{"text":"Why do chain restaurants insist on building such small locations? 35-45 minute waits are totally unacceptable for a couple of overpriced eggs. It's good, but not that good. Completely ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Ordered lemon ricotta pancakes and choriza grn chili omelet. Didn't like the lemon curd on pancakes, tasted canned so I scooped it off. Pancakes were okay, not as airy as other lemon ricotta pancakes out there. Omelet needed more chorizo and the long, stringly onions were chewy and hard to eat which ruined it for me. Will  try other menu items next time."}
{"text":"Super cool breakfast spot! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and I really liked the natural wood look. My whole table loved their food, and the order came out super fast. I don't eat animals, and they were very knowledgeable about what was and wasn't full of animal products. I had the veggie burger which came with no bread (cuz eggs) and everything was delicious! Definitely a solid spot to go with the family for a breakfast, brunch, or lunch and have a reasonable vegan option."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with the quality of the food at the restaurant that's everybody makes recommendations to go there and I was so terribly disappointed  They did not have cappuccinos and the coffee was not up to par.    I certainly would not recommend restaurants for either breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious and healthy with great service and easy parking in streets  Wife and I stopped By for breakfast on our first visit.  She had the Chicken quinoa power bowl with kale  I had Granola with yogurt  Both dishes were \"Delish\"  Great coffee  Fast friendly service  We will be back  PS-  We are on a house hunting trip near Hudson Ohio"}
{"text":"I really love the food here however it's just not the same since the company has changed brands."}
{"text":"Just awful. It only took like 2 min to get my food after ordering. How do you cook a turkey burger in 2 min? Microwave or pre cooked? Waste of money. Limited menu. I won't be back."}
{"text":"After several attempts at giving them the benefit of the doubt we have been disappointed.  We ordered the bubba's Benny and the description was completely wrong.  it said it came with homemade buiscuts and sausage and eggs topped with turkey sausage gravy.  that was not homemade and there was no sausage and the sausage gravy was hollandaise sauce.  This was not as advertised at all and i will never go here again!"}
{"text":"I've heard of other First Watch locations around the valley and finally tried this one by my new place... it was an excellent choice. For a late Sunday brunch around 11 am, we waited for about 20 mins to get seated and once we got to our seats and ordered, our food came out quickly despite it being a busy time.   We got the Farmhouse Skillet Hash, Classic Eggs Benedict, Millionnaire's Bacon, the Veggie Burger, Tomato Basil Soup, and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. EVERYTHING we got was delicious. It might have to do with the fact that we were hungry, but seriously, we thought everything was great. I personally had the hash and I thought everything went well together. The millionnaire's bacon, while a bit pricy, was also waaay worth the price especially if you're trying it for the first time.  Parking is easy, and you can also reserve your spot in line on the Yelp app! Looooved my first time here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting here and we were really pleased! The wait wasn't long for a Saturday morning around brunch time. (We actually could put our name on the waitlist by using the yelp app)  I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which was delicious!! And my fiancé got a hash that was also so good!! The only thing we wish it had was some espresso! We were surprised they didn't have latte option on the menu but we went with an iced coffee instead and it was fine! We would come back"}
{"text":"Went hiking to the lost dog and the ranger recommended this place. The food is original and outstanding. I ordered the chia pudding w granola w berries. Everything fresh and tasty. Also the million dollar bacon so amazing. The three stars is for the service. The older lady at the front is efficient but it seems no one else knows what to do. The person that cleans the tables could be sure everyone has water or silverware or coffee. Instead of just standing for a table to leave. The result is the waiter runs around bringing the mentioned items instead of taking orders or bringing the check. No one is directing the team everyone is doing little. A table of 8 cyclists at the restaurant before we arrived, got served after us and at different times. The busy waiter promised to bring water and it never came. We had to ask the person delivering the food for it. He also took the order from the people next to me first, however they arrived after me. I think this place could use a great manager to make it a 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  And I'm a fussy breakfast eater. Fresh and healthy choices. Oops the pancakes are delish too. Avocado toast is mouth watering and such a lovely presentation. I've also had the blt eggs Benedict. Yum!!  Go with a big appetite and order lots to share. We did and had a blast."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast place in Arizona. Love their new renovated looked. They put a spin on your typical traditional breakfast. They have weekly specials that are to die for.  Example: during the holidays they had cinnamon bun waffles. I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I've ever been to. I had the best egg sandwich and their fresh squeezed orange juice with a splash of beet juice was sensational! We came back the next day and had the most amazing pumpkin pancake! It's heavenly! I was shocked to see it only had 3 stars!!"}
{"text":"The roast beef and havarti  is excellent!! Service was quick and friendly.  Next time I  am in crocker  park in will be going  for the same sandwich...delicious"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the north hills! A brunch spot with healthy and vegetarian options. My husband got the breakfast tacos with chicken/eggs/cheese/avocado/black beans, and I got the market veggie grill with mozzarella cheese/spinach/grilled mushrooms/zucchini  & tomato basil soup - all great. Service was good/quick, and I like the decor. Will definitely return to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place !! I've taken everybody I know to eat here , I haven't come across a place that beats this one in terms of breakfast/brunch.  I love their pancakes , salads and my favorite crepes . You NEED to try this place out . Ohh and their fresh juices are delicious !!"}
{"text":"Very trendy for healthy,  fresh food. We're here for lunch and has a good choice of items.  Ham and guyere very tasty with a side salad.  Hubby had the roast beef and havarti.   Son had the hash scramble with crimini  mushrooms.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I went here for lunch with a friend not realizing it was no longer the Good Egg.   I ordered the kale tonic which was delicious and was sweeter then you might think a juice drink with kale would be. I also got the quinoa bowl which was perfection.   The place is clean and the staff is super friendly. I will be coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and really love it. They're accommodating of large groups with children and we've never been disappointed with our food or waiters/waitresses."}
{"text":"Omg... service awesommmmmmmeeeee... my server was super cute and nice... makes me miss Cali, but I think I found my spot to decompress  love at first bite!!!  Came on Sunday, place was too full, came back on Monday SCORE!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding menu and service. The avocado toast is a must try! Get there early because they close by 2:30pm."}
{"text":"About a year ago, I brought my out of town relative to First Watch expecting to eat at the Good Egg. FW was a welcome surprise and I am a regular at many locations. I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here but the breakfast dishes are the ones that stand out to me. My favorites are the lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd and the skillet breakfasts. Don't forget to check out the fresh juice concoctions as they are delicious.  This location can get very crowded on the weekends or when the snowbirds are in town. Think of this place as the more rustic alternative to Snooze."}
{"text":"Went here because I love a good breakfast. Had to wait a bit to be seated. When we were seated I noticed that both of the empty glasses on the table were all cloudy. When the waitress came I pointed out their condition and asked for new water glasses. She casually said \"oh that's just the dishwasher that does that\". My glasses don't look that at my house. I would say then it's time for a new dishwasher or detergent...something. I always have a bottle of water with me so I passed on theirs.  I ordered the Garden Omelette w/ ham and my friend ordered some veggie frittata. Both of our breakfasts were mediocre at best. Her dish had so many onions it was crazy! She loves onions but doesn't want the whole thing in her eggs. The broccoli in my omelette was still crunchy (undercooked). Not certain how this got \"best breakfast/brunch award\". Seemed no better than any other greasy spoon that serves breakfast, except much more expensive. Neither of us will be returning!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's very affordable and I and the portions are very large. It's great for students! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"For this area and especially for those in walking distance working at the hospital this place is a must visit. I am consistently surprised at the intriguing new dishes that arrive for specials. They got my order wrong but the dish they brought was delicious all the same. Quinoa pasta dish with a lemon sauce and fresh white meat chicken grilled on top. Also had the squash soup that tickled the tastebuds pink. Ignore the lackluster exterior and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm.  On my last visit, I ordered the amazing \"2 for you\"! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. 5 Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)"}
{"text":"After watching the commercial numerous times, (so much so that we could hum the tune) we finally decided to give First Watch try. I admit I had my reservations at first and thought that it would be a breakfast chain a little bit better Denny's.   As I entered, I was impressed by the decor but the restaurant seemed pretty low energy; reminiscent of a library. Looking at the menu, the descriptions of the meals we could choose from were very delightful and made it very challenging to make a decision. I settled for biscuits and gravy and my husband the trifecta.   My meal came out luke warm and the gravy looked more like a watery turkey soup. My husband was unimpressed with the \"trumped up\" Trifecta meal that was essentially very small turkey sausage links that looked undercooked, a standard pancake, and cold scrambled eggs. The presentation was underwhelming and made it seem that the cost to quality/quantity of food did not match.  When I go out to eat I do not expect to receive a plate that I could whip up myself in under 5 mins. This was surely that. Now I cringe when I hear the commercial in the morning.  I was really hoping that First Watch would be a hit and am disappointed that this was not the reality."}
{"text":"First time I've been here and it was delicious.   I got the Farmhouse Hash (two eggs over potatoes, onions, avocado, bacon).  This will be my new go to breakfast place."}
{"text":"I literally just walked out. 10 minutes after we were sat a server still had not greeted us to take our drink order. The cook happened to walk by and ask if we had been helped yet and if he could get our drinks. We asked for our drinks and then I watched him as he went to the back to start cooking again... Never bringing our drinks. No server stopped to say they would be with us in a minute. I watched as they all sauntered around with no sense of urgency. After time had passed I realized no one was in any hurry to help us. I was on my lunch break at noon and had no time to wait. So, we walked out.... Which saddens me because I was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I love breakfast/brunch at First Watch.  It's always a family treat after church for  us to go eat brunch.  The food is delicious and I've always had great service.  On Sunday there is a wait, but the food is good and cooked to order, so it is worth the extra time.  We hang out and read the Sunday paper that is in a basket just waiting to be read."}
{"text":"My wife and I were headed to eat'n Park when I said we should hit First Watch we haven't been there in a while, so that's what we did, she had the traditional breakfast I had the Power Bowl , quinoa, Italian sausage , roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, it is not only healthy but also delicious, although I did add an order of bacon as well , they have some of the best bacon around, my wife says she thinks it taste like the bacon we buy at Weiss meats , all I know for sure is I like it , the service here is always fast and very friendly, food is so fresh , and prices are not bad at all, much better than breakfast sitting in a warmer box ,"}
{"text":"I came here before my med exam yesterday.  The service is good. The waiting time is reasonable (or because I arrived early before 10 am).  The food is good (I have the basic scramble eggs, waffle, and bacon...., which is how one tastes the real taste of food.)  I especially love the coffee, a pot of coffee (not a cup of coffee and then waiting forever for someone to fill it....) I will definitely go back and bring my friend.... :)"}
{"text":"Randomly tried another First Watch location a couple months ago and it was beyond expectation. Honestly, from past memory I was remembering the restaurant as a dated, average breakfast place. It's not! Totally cute and such a great menu with a lot of fresh options. Seriously, every time we go I want to try the whole menu. The waffles and french toast are both AMAZING! I counterbalance with the Tri-Athlete breakfast, which has a lot of flavor for what it is.  As far as this location, it's a hidden gem. We couldn't think of anywhere else to go on a Saturday morning besides Snooze and were promptly told it would be over an hour wait. Um, no. Knowing how yummy First Watch is, we were pleasantly surprised to find this location right down the street with a 10 minute wait. Boom!   Parking is a little tricky since the lot isn't very big, but we found a spot on the street. FYI - Chick Fil A doesn't have any signs that we saw but there was a guy in the parking lot writing down plate numbers, so best to just find other parking."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Got the French toast and million dollar bacon. Food was absolutely delicious, I will definitely come back. Got there just after opening, and was seated immediately. Quick service from server, made sure we were given time to look at menu, and even offered staff favorites."}
{"text":"First Watch is a chain, but a very quaint modern farmhouse chic daytime cafe. Not only is the decor & color scheme farmhouse fresh, but the menu is vast with breakfast, brunch and lunch items. First Watch is known for using high quality, fresh & organic ingredients with many healthy options and fresh pressed juice offerings. Tip: Use the NoWait App to get in line ahead of time. I love their egg hash dishes. The \"Skillet Hash - Parma\" is two cage-free eggs atop fresh, seasoned potatoes, Italian sausage, house-roasted Crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with melted Parmesan, Mozzarella and fresh herbs. It's very filling and only about $13 ."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and surprised I didn't write a review. Came here with my wife for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning. We just keep on passing it by everyday and decided it was time.   We walk in and everyone was very friendly. Very modern looking with a flare of antique (if that makes sense). The place was about half full and not as bright as some breakfast joints but that's fine.   Our waiter greeted us and asked for our drink order. The cool thing is they brought three jugs. One for coffee, water, and hot water. Don't have to worry about refilling your drink. I like it cause it so convenient.   Anyways, I ordered the elevated egg sandwich which had an over-easy egg with bacon and avocado on a brioche bun. I thought it was pretty good. First bite and it breaks the over easy egg and it drips all over the sandwich. So good. The bun was very fresh too. Nice and soft. It came with potatoes and they were cooked really good. I really liked the meal. It wasn't too much and just enough.   My wife got the market skillet hash which had two eggs on top of their skillet hash. Hash had a bunch of veggies. She was raving about this. She really liked it a lot. Even said she wouldn't mind coming here again and she doesn't say that too often.   So again service was good. They really leave you alone to enjoy your meal. Really doesn't have to worry about your drinks since you can refill yourself. He also came a checked in us too. So I would say service was pretty good.   The thing here is you go up to the cash register to pay your bill. Don't have to worry about your server dealing with this which actually is pretty good.   Everyone was was smiling as we were leaving and telling us to have a good day. When the staff is smiling then you know they are treating their people right.   I really enjoyed the meal here. They don't rush you. Also, the meals seem like more on the healthy side. Smaller portions. Healthy portions. Good food. Wife likes it and good service. Didn't even have to wait for a tables and that what I like. I'll be back. Enjoy we did."}
{"text":"Let me first note I have Celiac disease, if I could eat normal people food, the rating would have been a 5. The rating is based on my experience as a gluten free diner.   I am visiting family and friends in Glendale, and was looking for a celiac safe place to get some breakfast, and First Watch popped up on my Find Me Gluten Free app. When we arrived on Saturday morning it was busy, but we got right in to a table. They had a gluten free menu (copy) available, with suggestions of how to order the food. Many options could be made gluten free, but there weren't any egg-free options, which generally doesn't matter unless you also have an egg allergy, like me. They used to have skillets, where you could just exclude the egg, but they have opted for more main stream options, making it not very satisfying for someone with multiple food allergies. That being said, I ordered a bunch of sides (potatoes, bacon, fruit, and greens with avocado) and it was just fine. Nothing spectacular but it was gluten free, I didn't get sick, and the waiter was very patient with my allergies. I would love to see more variety in the breakfast options, including gluten free bread and english muffins (you can just keep them in the freezer for when your GF people would like some), gluten free pancakes (not rocket science - and my kids would love you forever), and more egg free options."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 on a Sunday morning around 10:30. The wait was about 25 minutes and was well worth it. I ate the chicken chorizo burrito and it was spicy and savory. Be sure to download the app NoWait, it'll save you a lot of waiting in line time."}
{"text":"Great for a chain. It has a vast menu of fresh, good-quality dishes. Employees are friendly and the service is great. Can expect little to no wait. And they're on the No Wait app. Only negative - a little pricey, but you're being served organic, natural food.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location as well as others. My most recent experience was this past Sunday. Like many other businesses do when they are concerned with profit the establishment appeared understaffed. The waitress seemed hurried, and it took a while to get coffee, we never received any water and when our food arrived it was cold. Great location , tasty food, simply understaffed. My opinion as a business owner make customer service #1 priority. Put on enough people to properly and promptly, seat people, take their orders, deliver their orders as soon as they come up , and clear the dirty tables to start the process all over again. What it costs you in labor you will benefit 10 fold in comments and satisfaction. In addition the servers will garner higher tips."}
{"text":"The food was good- pumpkin pancake special, triathaliete, and frittata was great. The service was REALLY lacking though. The host didnt greet us and he looked like he was in a horrible mood. Waitress forgot our water and didn't check on us once! Took our order and brought us the check. Plus my husband ordered bacon and got sausage as a side (not a big deal) but instead of bringing a side of bacon they took his whole plate back to the kitchen so you know they were going to reuse that sausage on someone else's plate. Overall we may or may not go back the food was good but the service really ruined it for us."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite breakfast place! There are so many delicious menu options it's hard to decide what you want to order! They have a large healthy/fitness menu as well as many sinful options as well (like their lemon ricotta pancakes). They even have coffee cream flavors! Not just half and half. Reasonable prices for fresh quality food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They've definitely improved since they first opened! I love that there is free coffee and water while you wait.  Constant seasonal menu which is nice! They have a lot of fresh options, highly recommend the elevated egg sandwhich and their omelettes!"}
{"text":"No matter what part of the country, First Watch is a consistently great place to grab brunch.  Apparently Pittsburghers haven't caught on yet, because Sunday morning did not have a huge wait like most locations.  If you are looking for a greasy spoon, then go elsewhere.  This place has a clean, healthier, fresher outlook on brunch.  Sorry, no alcohol."}
{"text":"What can I say...?  You can never go wrong with First Watch for brunch. There is always a wait, because so many people love this place. From Florida to Kansas City to Columbus, First Watch never disappoints with fresh ingredients and tasty dishes. BTW, no alcohol."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast place to treat the family to. It's my son's favorite.  He is 6 and can eat 2 or the adult sized waffles!!!  I get the biscuits and gravy or the avocado toast. The menu is really unique and full of amazing food! It is the place I bring the out of town visitors we have."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant for 12 years when it was The Good Egg. It is close to our home and we enjoyed the staff. We always had great service and the food quality was excellent. We continued to visit it when it became First Watch for quiet a while and it was fine. Over the last year the service and food quality has continually gone downhill and has become less than satisfactory.  We gave this restaurant several second, third and fourth chances.  After several months of not eating there we decided to give it a try again this weekend with out of town company, and again we were extremely disappointed.  The egg dishes were barely warm at best and one dish was cold.  Our waiter returned it to the kitchen and we believe it was only microwaved when brought back because the waffle was touch to cut with a fork. The small fruit cup had moldy fruit.  The manager was not concerned with our less than satisfactory visit. It appears that  she is more concerned with moving her customers through the restaurant quickly then the experience they have while there. We have many new breakfast establishments in Gilbert  now and today was our last and final visit to the First Watch."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The Elevated Egg Sandwich was perfection! I recommend it although it was a tad messy. The smashed avocado kept sliding out of the sandwich and onto my clothes. But, I'll just be more careful next time. I also had the Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl and thought it was fine. I'm starting a new diet today and it was the healthiest option for me."}
{"text":"The toast! I could just eat the toast and leave happy. I usually get the bacado and it is more than enough food for one. Everything seems to come with fruit and a small artisan salad. This is my go to breakfast spot when we travel."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I wish it wasn't so far away the food is outstanding, all the breads are made fresh daily and I highly recommend the avocado smash sandwich! Service is great too!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time....GREAT food. The wait was kind of long -close to an hour- but it was worth it. Next time I'll check in online before arriving.  Our waiter was James, he was very polite and attentive, just awesome at his job. All the staff we interacted with were very nice. I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I love the  food, my favorite is que quinoa bowl and first time meditation juice, great customer service, is worth the long wait time. Perfect for healthy people. If you like junk food or big plates this is not the place for you. They need to open one in surprise PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Came to River's location last Sunday. AWFUL AWFUL service! The place at the point we arrived it was not busy at all. Several tables available and it was like pulling teeth to be seated. 4 people at the register and still nothing. Finally got a table, 14 minutes later FINALLY. A server came over, anything to drink? Really? How about, Good Morning, sorry for the ridiculously long wait, or something. Food was fine, ran out of coffee and had to ask another server for more. I really wish I could remember the gals name. She was rude. In the serving industry, you work a lot on tips, well to get a good one, you gotta do what you were hired to do. Needless to say, $2 is all I could do. Crocker Park, well we will just go back there.  ------------------------------------------------ 4/2/16 service good! Food DISGUSTING! Sent it back only for it to come back out worse! And $30! Guaranteed I will NOT come back! Please do not send me a gift card! Save it! Not that ONE person out of a million matters, but the food was terrible twice in one sitting! --------------- 4/22/17 Messed up order. Eggs Benedict my favorite on the breakfast menu, absolutely gross! Hard eggs, tasted like a spice was added! Done and done! At least I gave it a year to change my mind, but..... Eggs cold, hard. Came with arugula when I requested potatoes. Just not good!"}
{"text":"First time here was on Christmas Eve around noon. Thankfully my friend used the Nowait app to reserve us a table because it was packed (which seems to be the norm on weekends). I ordered the Farmhouse Skillet Hash that comes with potatoes, 2 eggs of your choice, bacon, onions, and a side of fruit with toast. The food was good, I can't complain. I wish I would've ordered one of their fresh juices though! Definitely good enough to make a stop here when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious breakfast here last week.  The avocado toast and egg were scrumptious!  Also had great service and staff!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch and lunch place. Wonderful service, food is absolutely DELICIOUS. So many options to choose from. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes were perfect. So light and fluffy! And the compote they came with was delicious. The waitstaff was super friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Very friendly staff/waitress! Food was all fresh, on time and so very delicious. My Mom loves pecan waffles, it wasn't on their menu but they surprised us by making her a custom one :) the toast is very full and fresh. You can tell it's all top quality! They provide a great menu for children and crayons."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, great service, inviting atmosphere.  Waited too long to write this, don't remember the menu item I had, but it was delicious.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food always came out amazingly delicious, their secret must be those cage free eggs haha   If you want fresh food that doesn't give you heart burn eat at First Watch."}
{"text":"I just wanted to comment on my Jul 4th visit to their Beachcliff Market Square location in Rocky River, Ohio.  I have never been to that location before and my overall experience was less than satisfying.  First, when we entered we had to wait almost 5 minutes for a host/greeter to come to the counter, welcome us and get our name.  The place was not busy as we were able to be seated almost immediately after placing our name.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but the coffee she brought us tasted burnt.  We needed to use a number of sugar and cream packets to mask the taste.  We ordered the \"Traditional\" breakfast with the ham slice and everything tasted overly salty or lacked taste all together.  The best part was actually my English muffin.  I believe that it was the manager who was the individual who rang us out at the end of our visit.   Nobody asked how the food or how our experience was so I decided to write their customer service office.  I even included a scanned copy of my cc receipt.  After a few emails exchanged, their service rep pretty much said that I should've disclosed this to my server.   Oh well.... my bad."}
{"text":"Went back again today (on my own dime) with some friends for breakfast, and the atmosphere was considerably quieter on the long wall of the restaurant. (Instead of noisy directly across from the bathrooms).   I had a Chorizo Omelet, which was good, but still I could easily make this at home. I wanted to try the breakfast potatoes just by themselves, and once again they were bland and just not delicious. Artisan bread still tasty, and the preserves were a bit less sweet and I could actually enjoy with my bread.  In the end, I don't think this place is for me. I can name several other breakfast places I would rather go to first for better food at a better price. They do seem to fill a niche with their juice bar and the power bowls...."}
{"text":"This review is not regarding the food but instead the customer service. Let me start off by stating that I don't often complete reviews however, I felt the need to do so. I visited today, Monday 4/16/18, around 9am. I had placed my order ahead of time and arrived about 25 mins after placing the order. Upon arrival, there were people waiting to be seated and other waiting to pay. Since its a small walkway, I stood to the side to let other be seated. Kelly walked up to the cash register and assisted the lady who wanted to pay for her meal that wasn't ready for pickup. After, she asked who was next as multiple people had formed around the register. After another customer stepped up and was cashed out, I walked up and stated I had a to go order. Kelly without hesitation, looked at me and stated my order wasn't ready. Note that she never checked on any orders behind her. I had noticed a bag behind her since the moment I walked in. After stating that, she told the gentleman standing behind me that should could cash him out. Once she was done with the gentleman, she turned around and made a statement about how the order had been sneaked past her. She provided me with the total and it wasn't until I asked for her name did Kelly's tone change. She asked how my day was. Kelly was not only unprofessional to myself but her peers as she barked orders around.   I've always visited the location on union hills and 83rd Ave and I'll either go there or elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place for a delicious bite to eat  Tons of options including lots of fresh and healthy choices. Current special has acai juice. Loved their coconut pudding with fresh fruit and amazing bread topped with almond butter."}
{"text":"First off I have to preface this by saying that I am the hugest first watch fan!  Today's visit was subpar. Coffee was bitter, acidic. Was not brought or asked if we wanted water.  Ordered the eggs Benedict florentine.  Poached egg was hard centered, no run at all :( I also was missing my avocado. The hollandaise was too lemon heavy.   Today was a sad day as we don't get to eat breakfast out often and I was so disappointed.  The staff is always friendly and willing to please."}
{"text":"Being from Cincinnati, I'm from a region that has many First Watch restaurants. I just visited my neighborhood store last week, but we received a gift cert during Christmas while visiting family in East Cleveland, and wanted to go to this recently opened location.  We were greeted and seated immediately. The server then greeted us and took our order shortly thereafter.   We received our food after about 10-15 minutes. I ordered a skillet and my date ordered a fruit crepe. My skillet looked really dry and was basically room temperature. Too much time in the heat lamp is my suspicion. The server came back and asked if everything was warm enough. Odd.  I sent it back, and they gave me a new dish in a few minutes.  I suppose that the recent opening and the new, developing First Watch region has something to do with the rookie mistake from the staff.  Overall, with growth in the service, the decor and atmosphere over all are pleasant.  This place will be a good spot to meet, I think...give them a little while to break in, I suppose."}
{"text":"Go to breakfast spot. I don't think I can think of  anything negative to say. I love almost everything on the menu. Easy going staff and friendly service."}
{"text":"Best breakfast, brunch, lunch, service in town! Affordable and great for kids. The staff is super professional and kind, Any plate you order will be delicious. Never disappoints. My favorite place for brunch for sure!"}
{"text":"We go to the Mayfield location a few times a month and it's consistently good with both food and service. I love their fresh squeezed juices especially Morning Glory. Our food favorites: Parma Hash, Elevated Egg Sandwich, and Chickichanga. On the healthier side, I really like the simple avocado toast spread. We also enjoy the seasonal specials they sometimes have. And we often have Liz as our server and she's great!"}
{"text":"Great attentive service and even more amazing food.  The orange juice turmeric drink was incredible and breakfast wrap with chicken and avocado was very fresh.  Clean, great seating, and easy parking."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. A bit expensive. Two of us had breakfast with coffee and oj and bill was over $30. $4.30 for 4 pieces of bacon is a bit much. Also had to ask twice for water and had to go find someone for syrup for my French toast."}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch previously but it has been a few years since I have been back and man i regret waiting this long to return!  They are a breakfast and brunch place and only open till 2:30 p.m. so don't show up too late.  Our server was very attentive to us and made sure we had everything we needed during our meal.  Over all the service was really great! Their menu has an array of breakfast options ranging from different omelets, pancakes (including multigrain), waffles, breakfast burritos, and items a la carte such as fruit, muffins, oatmeal, and different meats.  They also have an extensive lunchier menu with soups, salads, sandwiches, and protein bowls.  There are specials that they seem and have listed on a separate menu or an the blackboard in the restaurant.  All their food is very fresh and there are TONS of healthy options on their menu.  They seem to go out of their way to be health conscious.  I ordered one of their new fresh squeezed juices and the chicken pesto quinoa bowl.  The waitress highly recommended I try the kale juice, which contained fuji apple, kale, cucumber, and lemon.  If I could drink one of these every morning, I would.  It was super delicious and not bitter at all. The juice was the perfect amount of sweet and refreshing.   My entree was also very good! It consisted of quinoa, layered with chicken, chopped tomatoes, kale, carrots, basil pesto sauce and seasoned to perfection.  A co worker and I came for our lunch break, so we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place yesterday for lunch, and boy am I glad we did!  Everyone loved their meals; I particularly loved my pesto chicken quinoa dish--really delicious and healthy!  We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! I came inside and they looked SUPER busy! They have quite a lot of staff helping but even still the volume of people in there eating and waiting to be seated was crazy. I commend the staff for running around nonstop! I got one of the specials which was the tostadas with eggs and it had a salsa verde on it. The salsa didnt have much flavor to it at all, and I think for the portion/size of it the price was a bit much. It came with a black bean salsa on the side but it again didn't have a lot of flavor. I think next time I come I will try something a bit more hearty but overall friendly staff and a pretty good place!"}
{"text":"My first time there today & will definitely go back! My pancake with bananas & granola was delicious. Everyone at my table was happy with their food"}
{"text":"After work this morning I decided to give this place a try after having sent so many of my guests to it.     The service and food were perfect.  The staff were very friendly and took care of me very well.  I had the French Toast with a side of potatoes.   So good!  I will be sure to continue sending my guests to this fabulous breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The service was great! We had to wait about 20 minutes but it was worth it! The inside is decorated farm house style it's super cute! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I loved my breakfast!! Servive was a little slow but very nice people. I love the atmosphere. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the food was pretty good. Biscuits and gravy, the bacon and sausage were really good. The service sucked. I can deal with a 40 minute wait, because usually that means the food AND service are above par.  So we order we get our food no problem, were waiting for our food and my husband had some coffee, so I have  a cup since the pitcher is on the table.  I have ZERO problem paying for my cup of coffee. What I do have a problem with, is my food gets dropped at the table, I sit there for five minutes because I have no silver ware, finally stop a random sever because well I need silverware, my husband needed hot sauce so we stop another server again and get him hot sauce no biggie, finally got our server after we finished our meal and asked for additional coffee and creamer since our dish was clearly EMPTY.  They were moderately busy so I get there's going to be some slip ups and that's fine with me. What I do have an  issue with is , my server noticed I was drinking coffee, went in and added it to my check (again not an issue paying for the coffee), yet failed to notice I had no silver ware for 5 minutes, had to be asked twice for creamer ,  and never once asked if we needed anything or if the food was to our liking. She did however clear our table  when we were done and drop our check.  Had we been rude at all I could understand but honestly until I got the check and saw that she noticed that but basically hadn't noticed anything important like the fact I sat there while my husband and son were eating really irked me. She's lucky she even got a $2.00 tip, because I tip 20-25%.   So maybe the management should do actual sections for their servers instead of having them inside and outside that way after a 40 minute wait you can get decent service.  If you'd like to know which of your servers needs training I'd be happy to let you know."}
{"text":"Whoa, had no idea about First Watch or it's convenient location near school!  Came here to meet with a couple classmates and grabbed a juice from their Summer menu, I'm not a huge fan of really sweet juices and went with the \"Kale Tonic\". The juice came out in a reasonable amount of time despite the place being packed for breakfast and tasted fantastic! It mostly tasted like apples which I love, with the Kale flavor of course. It consists of Kale, Fuji Apple, Cucumber and Lemon. Absolutely delicious and refreshing for only $3.99, take that Whole Foods!  Definitely going to come back here for breakfast or brunch, their menu carries a bunch of healthy breakfast choices for great prices! Plus the service here is great, all smiles and friendly!"}
{"text":"I like the food, has healthy and fresh selection on menu. The only thing is that it's on the pricy side for breakfast food. Service is good too"}
{"text":"They got right!  Good fresh food, reasonably priced with friendly wait staff.  I always feel welcome."}
{"text":"This first watch definitely does not compare to our experience in Raleigh, NC .   I'm not sure how long this location has been open but the service was scattered , our food came out cold, under seasoned , and left us shocked because it was a complete 360 from our initial experience , it was very busy so maybe that was a factor ?   I respect the farm to table ingredients, the gluten free bread options ( more like a gluten free cracker)  , and the little things like pure cane sugar at your table , warm syrup for your waffles, pancakes, or crepes , BUT they charge for every little thing here which adds up and to me what you get isn't balanced with the prices . I mean my 3 year old's bacon and eggs came out with runny eggs and burnt bacon , half of an overcooked waffle for $9 total because his one egg add on was $1.83.   Reminder if you want coffee it's $3.00 per person , and they split the checks at the table adding taxes individually to every meal? Am I late in the service game ? What happened to one check one set of taxes for a party of 4? For a hour and 23 minute wait,  we left desiring a more tantalizing brunch ."}
{"text":"Great staff that is super friendly and welcoming. The menu is nice with many different options. The cost is a bit high for Downtown Tempe Mill Ave, but not too outrageous or anymore than some of the other places to eat. Great atmosphere with comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. Food way overpriced. Our eggs were cold and server gave us attitude when sent back. $56 for bfast for 2 adults and 2 kids. You do the math!"}
{"text":"Love the food!  Always tasty.   Like being able to check in remotely.  But it is SO HOT in this back room.  Stifling back here.  Ask to be seated in the main rooms."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! They make the food fresh right there. We had the avocado toast! Oh man, it was delicious. The service was attentive, fast and very personable. We had a great time here and great food here!"}
{"text":"First Watch is a solid choice for breakfast, and they serve until 2:30 everyday! I work in the plaza, and I usually come here a few times a month to have breakfast for lunch. I've yet to be disappointed by the food. I usually get the basic 2 eggs breakfast, but lately I've been getting the Bacado omelette- bacon, avocado and eggs- what's not to like? For a chain breakfast type place, their coffee is actually pretty good too.  They usually have a special offering menu with seasonal limited time dishes. I definitely recommend trying these. Over the summer they had breakfast tacos on the special menu, and I wish they would add them to the regular menu. So good! Now that it's \"fall\" (when it's still 100 degrees out, can we really use that term?), they have a pumpkin pancake meal with chicken apple sausage. Not only is the pumpkin pancake amazing, but the chicken apple sausage is really good as well.  Their prices are also reasonable. I can usually have a filling lunch here for $10 (maybe $12 if I get coffee).  I do wish the service was a tad friendlier sometimes, but they are at least timely."}
{"text":"I'm all about healthy eating that tastes good and this place definitely offers that. I'm not sure about the other branches in the valley but this branch was friendly and clean. Fitnesspal calorie counter app also has the estimated calories on most of the items on the menu if you are watching you calories"}
{"text":"First impression was the beautiful décor. We had the kale tonic juice and loved it. So refreshing and tasty. Tried the salmon and cucumber toast for the first time and it wont be our last. The servers were nice and polite who made our short visit pleasant. Will be back to try other items for healthy meals since they make things daily with no deep fryers as stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Had the Parma hash and it excellent. Service was great and so were the menu options. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I loved my breakfast I had the power bowl, as a Californian this food was awesome! I also had the bacon, a little sweet for my taste but I don't eat sugar. Even with them being busy I was seated fairly quickly and my food came out nice and fast.   I also had the kale juice and would drink this daily as a part of my fitness regimen."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. Eggs Benedict is awesome and I get the am superfood bowl which I always love. Ordered a bowl to-go today and it was so bad I just threw it away. Taste like someone poured salt all over it and the fruit was put with the granola so granola was soggy and also taste very salty and there no berry purée (best part). The service here is always awesome I think there must just be someone new I the kitchen or something."}
{"text":"Outstanding place for breakfast. Servers are efficient and friendly, the menu is extensive and interesting and the food is delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Holy slow! Terrible service. It took nearly an hour and a half for us to get in and out of First Watch yesterday. We only saw our waitress when she sat us down and when she came to drop our check (someone else brought our orders to the table). We waited the entire meal for refills on our water and didn't get them until after we had finished our food. The food itself was nothing special, just okay. I ordered the Chikichanga... I was underwhelmed by the quality and size of the portions for the price. Didn't seem like fresh ingredients. It cost over $40 for 4 people to eat an average breakfast, and one person literally had a single pancake.  In the end, it's just a glorified alternative to Eat-n-Park, with a heftier price tag. I don't get the appeal or the high reviews. Besides location... it doesn't seem to have much going for it."}
{"text":"Friendly service, very tasty food, good prices. In and out for lunch in time to get back to work."}
{"text":"This place was adorably decorated and had a menu full of healthy but delicious options! The market skillet hash was one of the best skillets I've ever had and had  a very tasty combo of veggies. The Floridian French Toast and egg benedict were also good, but the market skillet hash is a unique and flavorful dish. The juices are also fun to try although they didn't taste much different from anything you would get at a local juice bar."}
{"text":"First watch is a hidden gem. The atmosphere is homey and inviting (literally I got homesick during my visit).   The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. We had a 10 minute wait on a Sunday at noon and thought it was incredibly short for how fantastic our food was.   We split the new sweet bacon... it's a must try... absolutely fantastic. Then ordered the avocado toast and the works omelette. Everything was incredible. There was so many healthy options that I was wanting to try everything on the menu! This place is a must!! I can't wait to comeback and try new things !"}
{"text":"Mmm fresh healthy choices, always happy every time I visit. I feel at home here. Have yet to have a bad meal, and the service is always top notch. Just can't say enough good things about First Watch Ancala. I'll be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is pretentious and trying to be hip . . .touts cage free eggs, homemade preserves, natural this and that . . .which is all meaningless if you can't execute a good meal.  I read it several times trying to find something that was enticing. The Bacovado omelette was overcooked, the bacon inside the omelette was burnt and tough.  Not enough avocado to notice the taste in the overall dish.  Breakfast potatoes were the right texture but not seasoned.  Flavorless.  Toast was good; insufficient preserves.  Coffee was ok - I expected it to be great.  Nice dishes.  there are better places for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! The atmosphere was nice and very big so it's good for big groups or families. The price was inexpensive and the food came out piping hot! Their bathrooms were clean and the wait staff was friendly! They also have to go coffee for free :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Banana granola crunch pancakes with added chocolate chips. If you're feeling like something sweet, and love chocolate.. this is definitely worth it! Delicious! But they seriously aren't kidding when they say the pancakes are massive... massive is an understatement.   Menu has a great balance of savory and sweet with unique items. The atmosphere is that new trendy hipster modern farmhouse feel. Great friendly service.   Parking: street parking as well as a small lot in the back with about 8-10 spots that are shared with blaze pizza."}
{"text":"Meh.  I am just un-enthused about this place.  If you're going to spend your money on breakfast, at least make it a good one and go the Breakfast Club or Chompie's or something.    First Watch seems like THE spot for people over 60.  Every time I've been, I've been the youngest person there by far.  But it's not the clientele that matters, it's the food.  And I really think it's just okay.  Nothing really grabs me and screams \"this is the best damn pancake (or anything) I've ever had.\"    My advice:  Skip it and spend your hard earned cash on something else...like booze."}
{"text":"I just love this place. This is our families first choice for a local breakfast spot. It's fresh with a good variety, avocado toast, I get the chikichanga.  Then chocolate pancakes for the kids. The cofffee is always on point. BONUS: you don't want to take a five hour nap after you eat here. Definitely a notch above your average breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place!!! I've passed by here a bunch of times on University and my boyfriend suggested it one morning. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was REALLY good :) The only caveat was that on the menu it said over easy and it was definitely over hard. I like gooey egg sandwiches, but other than that it was amazing! They also source non-GMO and organic if you care :)"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and really enjoyed it!!! I was pretty hungry, but everything on the menu looked really good and I had a hard time deciding what to eat. I ended up choosing the breakfast sandwich with potatoes on the side and my boyfriend got the avocado toast with basted eggs.   We got our food rather quick and it looked really good! The egg on my sandwich was popped and leaked out before I got to bite into it but it was still really tasty! My boyfriends looked really yummy he said it was really good.   Overall would come back and try some of their other menu items. They also have fresh pressed juices and their eggs are all cage free which I appreciate!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, very reasonably priced, a lot of healthy options. This place is legit! I probably eat here 3 times a week and have something new that I love every, single time."}
{"text":"Great food, simple, and cute restaurant. I live 5 minutes away and it's always my go-to spot! I frequently get to go and order out and it's very fast and easy. They have a healthy variety of breakfast/brunch items. Love the avocado toast and kale tonic juice!"}
{"text":"First time here and the last. Service was slow and the food cold. Waitress arrived asking us to wait while she placed another order. Coffee mug was dirty with lipstick stains. Once the order was taken she never came back so we sat there with a pot of coffee in need of coffee cream. The food being cold after waiting for so long just ridiculous and very disappointing. We just got up and left, they clearly have some issues to work out as per recent reviews and this experience. \"They ain't nobody got time for that.\""}
{"text":"This breakfast house is solid. As a matter of fact if I was hospitalized across the street this would be my first stop for non hospital food which btw I love hospital food.  Had a fluffy veggie omelet, little potatoes and english muffins. Ate it all. Coffee was good and the gals were the sweetest. Even got a free newspaper to read.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday am at 10 & no waiting. Service was excellent. Drinks immediately & all requests granted quickly with a smile. I love the carafe of coffee on the table & specialty creamers. We ordered The Works omelette & Pumpkin pancakes. Both delicious & filling. Multi grain toast with home made jam was yummy! Millionaires bacon a bit pricey but fun to try at least once! Even offered a coffee to go. From beginning to end a great experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. Every time I go I try to get something different because they are always trying new things like the extremely good, but different take on an eggs Benedict they called an Italian Benedict. This is my go to breakfast place and I was thrilled to see they renovated the place with an updated look. The Botha are no longer crammed into the space and the place feels so open with the new layout with the exposed beams, new light treatments and new paint.u"}
{"text":"3 stars for the service.  The waitress wasn't that friendly.    5 stars for good price and healthy delicious food! Had the Tri-athlete egg white omelette, it comes with yummy toast and fresh fruit! Food was nice and healthy, not oily like most omelette are."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for a fulfilling breakfast without knowing what kind of food they serve. I was greeted by Jon and sat down at a table right away. He explained the menu and we got our food within 10 minutes. My family will be returning very soon!:)"}
{"text":"I love their Belgium waffles! Light  and fluffy with a slight crisp. Something I could never do at home! Cute place and modern menu. While I am a fan of the classics, they off avacado toast and millionaire bacon.  The wait is typically long (welcome to Gilbert), but you can use the No Wait app to get on the list ahead of time.   Service here is typically a little slower, so don't come here for a speedy breakfast during peak times."}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for in a brunch. Breakfast served till 2:30 and the choices are great. The food quality is terrific. Bacon is crispy, eggs are fresh and service is kind."}
{"text":"A delicious place for breakfast! I had the trifecta which included a perfect belgian waffle, eggs, and bacon. There are a few combinations you can make. I'm a woman so I do like my options :)! Their menu is great, lots of healthy options to choose from and a lot of the egg breakfasts allows you to switch to egg whites at no additional charge!"}
{"text":"We were seated in a corner and 1st thing I see is lipstick on the cup 2nd food on wall and bench, GROSS! food is great. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"My first NoWait experience! Added myself to the list virtually on a busy Sunday morning and cut down the queue by at least five minutes. Yeah technology!  I like a good First Watch. They had a few in St. Louis, always a safe bet for breakfast.Especially when with the parental units. You know it'll be good service and good food.  First Watch has really upped their game in the past 5-7 years. More contemporary decor and healthy menu options like fresh squeezed juices. It's not something my mom looks for on a menu, but great for everyone out there who is more conscious about their intake.  Avocado toast with a side of eggs was perfect for my mammy. She also wanted pancakes so I graciously made the \"sacrifice\" and ordered it as my plate. That way we could share. Plenty of food for two hungry gals.   The bill for two plates plus two fancy juices was $35 plus tip. And we didn't have to wait to be seated. A very productive Sunday on vacation."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place for normal American breakfast on Sundays, but when it changed to First Watch from The Good Egg it went too booshie... and I don't want all that fluff for breakfast.  McDonalds breakfast sounds better..."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is amazing. The breakfast sandwich and the skillet hash are so good I can never try anything new, I always have to order one or the other. You can also get in the line from the app to avoid waiting at the restaurant which is super helpful (every restaurant needs to do this)."}
{"text":"Went there with co-workers. Service was speedy even though it was peak lunch hour. The food was delicious and a nice variety breakfast/ lunch. They made a vegan/ veggie option for my co-workers. Atmosphere was real nice and comfy. I would visit this location again for sure and check out the others around town."}
{"text":"The locals told me this was a great place and they didn't disappoint. The omelette was exceptionally good! The homestyle potatoes also good. I wasn't a fan of the whole grain toast, but the omelette and potatoes made up for it.   The server was a little on the mediocre side, but I've had worse. Great atmosphere. I would absolutely be returning the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wanted to update my review of the food ...once we finally got seated ..the food was good and the service was top notch !!! If only the front end service could get it together ... They did respond to my post and u appreciate that they took the time to listen ..."}
{"text":"Good food,  nice atmosphere, decent prices. I got the Chikichanga and it was excellent. The only complaint is my wife ordered her eggs over easy and they were over medium."}
{"text":"This place took over US Egg. Major upgrade. Decor and ambiance are very relaxing, place just has a good feel to it. I've been therev3 times since I found out it had opened. Staff has been great every time. Fast service, food came out in a reasonable time.   I've had the Elevated Egg Sandwich, Multi grain Pancake, and Belgian waffle. All 3 were delicious but the egg sandwich was absolute , sooo good. All the ingredients just come together to make a perfect breakfast sandwich. Highly recommended.  If I had any criticism its that their juice portion is tiny. But I get it, juice is expensive and it tasted fresh so maybe they squeeze in the back."}
{"text":"Easy access from the highway.  Juice bar.  Parking lot.  Several locations in the region now.  Good staff.  Nice presentation of food.  But too much bread for me.  I would recommend this for breakfast, lunch and brunch.  Basic solid old timey food.  Traditional."}
{"text":"Server was very good, the coffee was delicious.  The food was terrible.  My pancake was god-awful.  The good news was that the staff noticed I wasn't eating it and took it off my bill without me asking, which was nice.  I don't know I'd go back...the creepy guy camped out at the entrance was not necessarily their fault but the food was, and so I'd probably hunt for something else next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and a cup of coffee. The ladies here are amazing and super nice. They bring out my food in a timely manner and the eggs benedict there are to die for. During the Fall/Winter season, they have a specials menu that was delicious. If they still have it I recommend trying the pulled pork sandwich and the butternut squash soup. meals are reasonable priced, and if you go online and subscribe to their newsletter you get a buy one get one entree coupon for your next visit, and you get a free entree on your birthday. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Oh it was just awful.  I used to have great memories of fresh and tasty food from years ago.    This time was not like that.  Went on Christmas Eve day around 10:00 am.  Cold food!  Everything was bland and not quality.  Portions tiny and overpriced.  Never going to any of the chains again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Highly recommend. The menu os great lots of organic veges, juices etc. Staff is great and polite."}
{"text":"I always love coming here I never leave with a bad thought of coming here. My wrap was great and the service was so nice and greeted with happy warm smiles."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place because of their menu and their clean bright atmosphere.  They were friendly and I liked that they sent us a BOGO for signing up for their email.  My daughter got the crepes which I think were good (they were beautiful with fresh fruit) but she just didn't care for them.  My husband's waffle was delicious and crispy outside while fluffy inside.  I got the Key West Crepegg (omelet / crepe) with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato etc.  It was ok except the turkey tasted a little old and there was the tiniest scoop of diced tomatoes and a tiny dollop of sour cream which was frustrating and the english muffin that was supposed to come with it was absent.  The coffee and the orange juice was really good and you could tell they have a nice group of regulars, like a family.  It looks closed from the freeway but the entrance on the opposite side is inviting and warm.  Just a few changes and this place could be spectacular.  I think i would like to try the lunch offerings and I will probably go back just to see how it is the next time."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little something about this place. My bf and I went here for brunch (his first time) and everything was great. The service was amazing from beginning to end. We had and avocado toast as An appetizer and that was delicious! I had the BLTE (Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, eggs) with their Seasonal Squash soup. The squash soup was so rich and creamy, when I took the first spoonful I felt like I was sitting by a campfire on a cold winter night all warm and snuggled up. My bf had the seasonal bacon which was soooo good I stole a piece and added it to my sandwich. The overall experience was great and we are definitely going to be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Amazing change.  The look, the seating, the food - all great.  I had a hard time picking today. This is a breakfast place- why would it take to long to order? Because the selections are all very different and new to me. I love this place   Such a great find.  juices are fantastic - the menu? I cannot wait to go there again and choose another new item to try. I am a kid and in candy store here."}
{"text":"First Watch continues the solid trend they started: Fresh, quality food with attentive service.  Oh, and the Day Glow juice is becoming addictive."}
{"text":"Finally, a farm to table restaurant in the South Hills!  Absolutely awesome, good for you food. The Kale Tonic is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I often eat at one or another of the first watch restaurant. They have a very broad mix of food choices. That way everyone can get traditional breakfast items as well as some newer creative items. I love the omelettes because they do not over cook them. That's important to me. I don't prefer brown omelettes. The service is most often very competent. And they are quick to refill your coffee or tea or water. I also like the fact that the side item that comes with your omelette is a small mixed green salad instead of potatoes. That might be an option you can get but it's not for me. Plus I'm not a big one for bread so they will substitute sliced tomatoes. I appreciate win restaurants are flexible that way."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped on our way back from a trip out of town. We'd had breakfast and it was almost 1:30 so stopped for lunch.  At first we went to the patio where we found the tables and chairs as well as floor covered in bird !  The birds were hovering and noisy. When the two tables near us left, the flock of birds dive bombed the plates, eating the 'remains'.  The waiter came out and I asked if we could go inside...I'd have left if they'd not had an inside spot for us.  That was SOOO disgusting. Birds carry diseases, I couldn't bear sitting in that environment!  We ordered half sandwiches and salads, each a different item.  The salads had the best dressings and sandwiches were great. I'd come back, definitely, but NOT to the patio."}
{"text":"I live in the Los Angeles area and visit the Phoenix area a few times a year, usually for Baseball Spring Training. A friend introduced me to this restaurant. I have never been disappointed. Service has always been great. Food is always fresh and tasty. Only been there on the weekends but if your visit is on a weekend and don't want too much, get there before 8:30am."}
{"text":"Just amazing food! My favorite was #Morning meditation juice. excellent atmosphere, beautiful and clean place and thank you  thank you,thank you for cooking with so low oils and butter! My stomach was thankful!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious. Every meal I've eaten here has been great. Avocado toast and chickeechanga are my favorites so far. The staff is friendly. On the weekends they get busier, but they use the Nowait app so you can arrive just in time to get your table, and that is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Their food is great; but can't in good conscience give my patronage to an establishment that employs people with such an appalling insensitivity to those with disabilities. I was there earlier today for brunch and I literally overheard who I presumed to be the manager poking fun at one of their OWN staff members who, I presume was hard-of-hearing because she was wearing a hearing aid. I overheard him say \"hey, can you hear me!?\", and the other servers joined in to  laugh at her. They LAUGHED. I was so disgusted that I almost spit my food out so I could just pay my bill and leave. I have friends who are deaf and there's nothing amusing about the challenges they face. I think it's widely agreed that there is enough ignorance and petty bigotry floating about in this world as it is, I'd really prefer NOT to have to deal with it while I eat.   Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this breakfast joint!  Food is clean, environment is upbeat and the servers are on point. My only issue is that this is a breakfast establishment and wish the coffee was representative of such. Coffee is key to rounding out your breakfast. I would prefer to order it here verses doing to Starbucks prior."}
{"text":"Nice service, good ambience, nice crowd, awesome food. Really happy with it.  Pro-tip: Make an online reservation on yelp to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"I stopped in thinking this was a little Starbucks like cafe but was very pleasantly surprised to see that they were so much more. They are a full restaurant with such friendly staff and an amazing array of fresh food to offer. I only had time to grab an iced coffee this morning but after chatting with the wonderful ladies up front, I will definitely be back again to try their delicious food as well."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy options that taste incredible! Their fresh veggie juices are to die for. My fiancé hardly ever craves healthier food, but this has become one of his favorite brunch spots! This is one of the places we're actually willing to try most of the menu.  Super reasonably priced and quality food."}
{"text":"Went for brunch last week. I like First Watch. Nicer option than Bob Evans and other chain breakfast places. Fresh, modern, and great prices. I had one of the specials - crab cakes egg benedict. It was very good. The service was slow and a bit clunky...I imagine it will iron out soon."}
{"text":"The blond chubby hostess was so rude. I asked for two people sitting and I had my baby with me.. when she called us she goes, \" for two? But it's actually 3.\" And she kept coming up to us like she wanted us to leave already. The food was good but need work on making people feel welcome"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast, absolutely yummy food, excellent service and beautiful atmosphere. Definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great customer service. Morning meditation is my go too! Food is always great & if not theyll make it right!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to find a breakfast place near my new home. The menu sounded fantastic. But after a 30 minute wait for breakfast. The taste and quality of the food was terrible. I felt like we were totally invisible to our server. We had hoped to make this our new stop on Saturday morning bike rides, we'll keep looking for a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Ummmmm their Power Wrap!? Me thinks YES!!! Sooo so good. Food is always fresh.  4/5 because I've only ordered one thing and it's always to go (haven't dined in) but so far I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Yikes. I haven't been back here in a while, but maybe that's a good thing?  I ordered the Chicken Avocado Salad, picked it up and when I got back to work and finally opened it up the sight was abysmal. I paid $10 bucks and all I got was ONE slice of avocado and like 4 tiny pieces of chicken. What the hell???  I've never seen a more sorry salad in my life. VERY frustrated that I basically paid $10 bucks for lettuce. At that price point the salad should be full and hearty. I definitely got jipped!"}
{"text":"The First Watch is just ok. I like the concept and that are many healthful items. I also appreciate that nutritional information is readily available.  I typically get the Tri-Athlete Omelet meal. It's an egg white omelet with onions, tomato, and green chilis. I typically ask for feta in the omelet and they do not really put enough. It's usually just a sprinkling on top. The onions inside are always undercooked and have a straw like texture since they are shredded. The English Muffin is typically chewy, like it's toasted for too short of a time.  Their Hummus Wrap is pretty bland. I do, however, like their pancakes. You can choose from a variety of mixins. I've had blueberry banana and chocolate chip banana. They are always really well cooked.  They should really do \"healthy\" a little bit better, with better cooking technique and spices. Also, don't be so stingy with the cheese!  Their chamomile tea is really good."}
{"text":"This is not an UberEats issue. This is a First Watch issue, and apparently only the one on Dobson. Last Sunday, order was incomplete...no drink, no muffin with granola bowl. No problem, UberEats refunded our money. This Sunday 2 orders of yogurt/granola bowls missing granola. Contact UberEats and they (free of charge) send us 2 more yogurt/granola bowls...with NO granola. Clearly First Watch's kitchen staff are incompetent. We called the resturant, manager apologizes, gets our address to send gift cards, and now we are off to the store to buy granola to make our breakfast complete. Makes me wonder how many orders the kitchen staff screws up at the actual resturant. Food is good...but we will NEVER use this location again. 3 strikes and your out! UberEats is great, btw."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip mall (Scottsdale Promenade, near Nordstrom Rack) but is one of the best breakfast places around. I go there once or twice every week and everything I've ordered has been consistently good. My favorites are the Floridian French Toast (with toasted wheat germ and piled high with fresh strawberries, kiwis, and blueberries), the Trifecta (most delicious waffle I've ever had--my hubby likened it to funnel cakes), and the Chimichanga. For an extra ~$1.50 you can get real maple syrup with your order. Those of you that know what I'm talking about, you know that nothing compares to REAL maple syrup. Every time I go to this place I leave happy and satisfied. Try it, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Omg they had a vegan option and it was amazing. Food portions are a little large. Clean, friendly and open. Will be back. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Customer service contacted through yelp and apologized for the misunderstanding.  I was supposed to be charged 5.99 for two pancakes and not charged individually.  I realize that the difference between the two charges is only $4, but the money is not why I originally gave a bad review.  First Watch offered to pay for my next meal to make things right.  I declined this offer because I wasn't after any free-bees.  I am fully satisfied knowing that they fixed the issue and responded in a very professional manner.  Thank you Eleni.  I will defiantly eat at First Watch again.  The pancakes are amazing and huge!!  :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at First Watch. I had the farmhouse hash with scrambled eggs. It was amazing. It also is whole 30/ dairy free if you just request with no cheese. They also will substitute your toast with extra fruit if you prefer."}
{"text":"Here for a pre-opening fund raiser for local non-profits. Last ate at a First Watch 15 years ago in Lakewood Ranch (Bradenton Fl) and became regulars there. Even though this was pre-opening, there's nothing to complain about.  Silverware had to be requested-only issue. I know, so what.  Service was attentive and efficient. Order was right and delivered in a very reasonable time. Food was done right. Bacon. Order bacon. Belgian waffle was great. Eggs done as ordered. Potatoes were tasty. Wish they had Texas Pete but did have Cholula and Tabasco.  The facility was a little noisy due to the very open floor plan but we were able to carry on a conversation without yelling. Ample parking. Priced right. We will return."}
{"text":"This Saturday morning at 7:40am I had breakfast, the food was fantastic yet I found it interesting that there were several tables around me that were dirty with dishes and my waitress (with a rose tattoo on her arm) had a enough time to sit and eat at a table; I found this odd and disconcerting."}
{"text":"The Solon First Watch, OK, but the Fairlawn restaurant head and shoulders over this one."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with everything at this First Watch, from the friendly service, to the healthy food. We ordered Omelets and they were superior. Whole wheat toast was served with the meal.  Arugula was served on the side for one meal, potatoes on the other.  No salt on the potatoes was an excellent move. High ceilings and windows gave this haunt a bright and airy feel. I love the coffee too!  This is my favorite new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I came because I heard a few people suggest trying it out since they bought out the Good Egg. I got the Belgian waffle and was not impressed. The customer service was lacking the personality of casual conversation. I left 20% tip because I know people have to earn a living but the food didn't warrant me making a return trip."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have breakfast. People are always friendly and the food is like eating at a good farm side bed and breakfast. It is our quick go-to place for weekend breakfast. We always leave full and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Consistently poor food and terrible service. Once in a while you may get lucky and have your food cooked as ordered but don't count on it. Service is certainly not consistent either. We call this our once every six months never again place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is a healthier versions of traditional items. Everything is so flavorful. Their pancakes never leave a pool of grease, their fresh fruit is actually fresh and the eggs are never weird. The service is fantastic too. It's one of my favorite places to eat at and I never feel guilty when I leave. I am so happy they opened up a closer location."}
{"text":"First things first, make sure you click on 'Skip the line' within yelp so you can get your name on their list before arriving. This will help expedite the seating process. We arrived with 10 parties ahead of us and we were seated within 10-15 mins. Not bad at all with newspapers from WSJ to keep you busy.   Second, hands down the best breakfast joint we have ever tried here in PHX. We got the millionaires bacon, the elevated egg sandwich, and the farmers biscuit sandwich (I switched the biscuit for a brioche bun). Everything was amazing and my taste buds were in heaven.   The bacon was crispy and tasty. A salty and sweet treat that we ate at the end of our meal actually. I definitely felt like a million dollars after eating it.   Both sandwiches were amazing as well. Crispy buns and all the ingredients just mix so well with each bite. The farmers sandwich had a mayo and apple butter spread that made each bite sweet and salty as well, delicious! I forgot to mention, their potatoes were so good, you don't even need their real, all natural ketchup on the table.   This place is so good, we decided to come again the next day. I'm actually sitting here waiting for my food and writing this review. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Btw, they do have military discount. Thank you First Watch for appreciating those who serve and who have served.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Out of the box taste ideas and traditional. Plan on a wait on weekend mornings. Noisy. Accommodating staff. Good service."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went twice this past weekend. The menu is excellent, the staff is super friendly, and the decor is inviting. So glad this is close to home!!"}
{"text":"Hostess stand right at door so a few groups could not get in since people in front would not move.  Move the GD hostess stand. It seemed to take a long time to get seated with hostess also working cash register.  Ordered the cup of soup & half sandwich.  The tomato basil soup was OK, not much basil flavor...have had much better.  Enjoyed my beef & havarti cheese sandwich with some grilled onion tomato.  Our service was good."}
{"text":"The place was empty.  Stopped for late breakfast after early appointment.  Ordered the Acapulco omelette to go.  It was nice. Omelette had some chorizo sausage, avocado, onions in it.  Came with FW potatoes which are like home fries (which were OK) and some fresh fruit. Menu has some nice omelettes that a little different or you can create your own.  Menu has some heathy items on it.  Lunch menu looks nice.  While you can get some different omelettes, have had the similar food at better price at eat n park and it comes with fresh fruit also."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, decor is very modern and clean, staff was welcoming from greeting, to hostess to server.  menu is solid with a mix of traditional breakfasts, healthy options and a few unique creations.  you can tell that the management and staff have paid attention to the details from sugar dispensers on the table to the water served in old milk jugs.  food quality is great too.  menu prices might be a tinge high for breakfast, but worth it for the experience!  very cool place!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in the area! Wait staff is always friendly and smiling. They're very accommodating to food allergies and are willing to modify anything on the menu...I'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. I had the Kale tonic which was amazing with the Gruyere and cheese sandwich which was to die for. There was a bit of wait so call ahead and put your name on the list. The food is served very fast."}
{"text":"Bring a coat, maybe a hat and gloves too!  Our first time to this new location.  Menu selections were great although they do not have gluten-free toast.  I ended up with the Quinoa bowl which was delicious.  My husband also liked his skillet.  I was wearing pants and a long sleeved shirt and was freezing!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast restaurant!  Great quality, local ingredients.   Delicious food.   Diverse menu ...something for the entire family!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this for breakfast.  It is on par with Terrace and a half step above Stacks.   It is a bit expensive.   Service is average.   A 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"I've been to First Watch a couple of times because they have WiFi and I work remotely. Good food for a fair price. The WiFi cuts out every 30 minutes or so and that's a little annoying, but otherwise I like this place. The veggie omelette it's excellent and they don't overcook it which is always a good thing. I hate brown stinky over cooked eggs. French toast is really good also."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST GOALS!  We moved from Florida to Charlotte a few years ago and have been praying for a First Watch to open in the area.  At last our prayers have been answered!  We LOVE LOVE LOVE this spot and it was much needed as there aren't that many great breakfast spots around.  It is healthy and fresh.  My favorite is always the avocado toast, but the Floridian waffle and Trifecta are a must try.  Speaking of must try items...don't forget to try the million dollar bacon if your have the chance, AMAZING!  You will be hooked on this spot, guaranteed.  And to the owner of this first location I say THANK YOU SO SO MUCH for bringing this the Charlotte area.  (For more, follow me on Facebook & Instagram @ Foodie Vida #foodievida)."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!    We enjoyed breakfast at First Watch while visiting our son in Tempe.  The food was delicious and super generous portions! I had a yummy pumpkin oatmeal that was served with dried fruit, pepitas and a maple cream on the side. Paired with a beautiful cranberry muffin! My husband and son enjoyed the amazing bacon, eggs and fabulous breakfast potatoes.  The atmosphere is chic Urban Farmhouse, comfortable and not too loud!  Service is flawless with friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff  who seem to really love their jobs!"}
{"text":"Love First Watch and was excited to see a new menu. I tried a few new items today the elevated egg sandwich and the turkey biscuits and gravy. Both were really good. They have a bunch of new items too. But my favorite the key west crepe eggs is no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"First Watch is my absolute favorite breakfast place. I've never had a bad meal. My favorite was the Key West crepe eggs, but they recently changed the menu and it is no longer on there. The Westlake location was recently renovated and  is beautiful inside.   They have a great birthday club that provides you with a free birthday meal. They also send lots of coupons.  Inside they provide free coffee while you wait. They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Everything is amazingly fresh and so good. I LOVE the omelettes and their toast is sooo good as weird as that sounds. The only thing that could make it better is lower prices on their pressed juice drinks. I feel like I am paying $4 for a glass of ice and a little juice. Oh and I'd love a mimosa or bloody Mary option too, haha."}
{"text":"Our server was great, he went above and beyond! We walked in around 730 on a weekend morning and there were quite a few people in the restaurant but didn't seem to have a hostess. Rossi came over and sat us and also was our server. He was great! He tried upselling us two of the new juices but we were stuck in our way wanting an oj and apple juice. Oj was so good and so refreshing, so was the avocado toast (so basic I know). The granola pancakes were so good too, I love when restaurants put the fruit in the batter and that's just what they did with the blueberries. The biscuits and gravy were so so,the gravy was nothing to write home about. The best part of all was that Rossi was just on point with everything. He was the hostess, server and clearing tables. Just so on point with everything. He even brought out a small sample of the kale juice (can't remember the name) for us to try and could order next time. It was honestly so good, and so nice of him!"}
{"text":"We decided to try new restaurant with a menu that looked good We checked in and we're told 30 to 45 minutes  After an hour and 15 minute wait, I asked the host how much longer, he told me another 15 to 20 minutes I then asked him why people were getting seated in front of us, he said there's an app where you don't have to wait at all, that's why you're waiting  The app would've been crucial information to have during the hour and 15 minute wait There were also 4 table not being sat throughout our wait  I was so put off by his attitude  I am disappointed , I REALLY wanted to like this place The lack of communication and the disregard for customer service turned me off so much I'll never be back There are too many other places to eat for that kind of service  I don't mind waiting but the staff was truly awful ( I never write reviews) We went to Snooze"}
{"text":"A healthier option for breakfast or lunch without sacrificing taste. Always consistent when I have come and experienced great service."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I had the most expensive bad breakfast we have ever had. In addition to the poor tasting food within 20 minutes from eating we both got sick. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Somehow we are lucky enought to always have Tawnya as our waitress and we LOVE her. She is great with my son and is able to joke with him. He always get the chocolate pancake which is as big as his head. I love their Honey Pecan Chicken Salad and if you go, they have this amazing butternut squash soup.  Tawnya will make sure she gets the order in quickly and is very friendly. Love the food here."}
{"text":"Super delicious.  Millionaire's Bacon and Classic Eggs Benedict is the way to go.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Trendy, scrumptious and even healthy breakfast, brunch and lunch place in a really cool part of Tempe. Our breakfasts were served promptly and piping hot by a very courteous waiter. The menu selection is awesome, no matter how healthy or decadent an option you are looking for."}
{"text":"I've been to First Watch on several occasions for breakfast and it has always been a great experience.  Most recently I went with a group of six and it was another fantastic time.  We showed up on a busy Sunday morning but the wait was short compared to other options nearby.  I typically order a traditional two-egg breakfast but this time I tried out the Ham & Gruyere omelet.  It did not disappoint as it was loaded with tons of ham, more than I ever bargained for!  I'd never had Gruyere cheese before either, but it was exceptionally tasty.  Went great with the house potatoes and wheat toast.  Service was excellent, water was always on hand, and the atmosphere was relaxing.  A wonderful Sunday morning, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Having seen this neighborhood go through a major transition over the years. There's no denying that this is a great addition to the area. I popped in for a late lunch with my family one day and the service was outstanding, despite the restaurant being rather busy.   The food is absolutely amazing and it has a very rustic, homestyle feel to it. The menu just feels more comforting than a lot of other places nearby. There's a lot of care put into the preparation of the food and it's a difference you can taste. Plus, with so many \"fast casual\" options nearby, it's nice to have a slower-paced restaurant you can sit down and have a conversation at.  I know my parents have become a big fan of this spot and it's easy to see why. It reminds me a lot of Bob Evans... but with a lot more care and quality put into what you're being served. There's just a lot to love about this place and I'm glad it's come to the neighborhood. The only thing knocking them down a star is the tea selection. I was a bit disappointed to find they only have caffeine-free teas--at least that's the selection I received anyway. Especially if I pop in for breakfast, I'm going to want some sweet, sweet caffeine."}
{"text":"We absolutely would drive many miles to have breakfast at this FW.  The food is all natural and such a pleasant departure from your standard breakfast/lunch place.  Love their coffee...it's always yummy with a pot left on the table.  Yes the price is a bit more but worth it.    Our waitress on the last two visits was Carly.  What a fun sense of humor and a great waitress.  She can't do enough for you all with a smile. ??  Looking to our next visit to First Watch in Mesa"}
{"text":"Nothing special  Processed and commercial tasting food.  Quick good service.  A meal you can get anywhere"}
{"text":"Went with my son today for breakfast and let me say the ONLY reason for the 1 star is the service- we had to ask anyone/everyone walking by to refill our drinks and we never did get our check until we went up to pay and had to ask for it."}
{"text":"Being a cook for years ive always had a high expectation of food when i go out to eat , however after my first meal at first watch i was hooked , my usual choices are the chickichanga, the works omelet or a double stack of pancakes . the super foods bowl is tasty and light if you want something akin to cereal. Every time ive been there the waitresses or servers (whatever title you wish) have always been attentive and always willing to get something extra for you. if you do attend i suggest you ask for christina if she is working , she is bright and positive and always honest and upfront about wait times and if service is going awry. All in all i would go eat and enjoy yourself and do yourself a favor and order the orange juice."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to visit this First Watch a couple of times now and have found a couple of things. The good news ... The service over the past visits has been consistently good. From the host/hostess to the waiter/waitress, all staff are friendly and accommodating. The bad news ... I've also found that when the operation is extremely busy, the stress of the volume drives the quality of the food down. For example, today our egg dishes were a bit off and the potatoes under cooked. Also, the silverware was dirty. If the get this issue straightened out, I will re-write the review and up the stars."}
{"text":"I was not particularly impressed with this place after deciding to try it since it was close by to me and seemed like a decent brunch option. I tried their pancakes here, and they were enormous, but lacked flavor and were covered in way too much drizzle/sauce. The service was alright, and the patio was nice to sit in, but otherwise the place was just very average. I would probably choose to travel farther next time to get a more decent brunch."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Their omelettes are perfect. The service is awesome. The waiters were extremely friendly and happy to help. Just a great atmosphere and perfect for brunch! So glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"This is was pretty good breakfast place, our sever was kind and timing was great. The avocado toast was creamy and delicious along with a side of scramble eggs."}
{"text":"Great concept and super great breakfast!  Order at the counter and in a few minutes great hot food!  Jalapeño cornbread is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh food and the juices are pretty tasty too. A little pricy but for fresh food it's a winner"}
{"text":"Second time at this place.. food is good but mot consistent & the umbiounce was nice. The servers are not upto the standard of what should be represented.. went into this place yesterday with a family member, thought I would give it a 3rd chance, plus my family member frequents the locations in Tucson, Az and has always had a great experience.   Well right off the bat the server was not so approachable hmmm not surprising.. she sat us in a section that had so many flies!! & we were inside!  I ordered the quinoa chicken pesto bowl. When I recieved the bowl I began to eat it and as I was about four bites in, I had crunched down on a peice of something, turns out it was a BIG PEICE OF PLASTIC! Yes thats right Plastic! I told the waitress & she said she would give me a new bowl. When I got the bowl I had no appetite and ruined my meal & time with my faimly member. Waitress never took off the meal on my bill.. Wow! Really! & DIDNT TELL HER MANAGER!  When I went upto pay I told the check out person I was NOT going to pay for my meal that had PLASTIC in it. She was so Rude & never apologizeed for the experience let me just say it didnt stop there!  NEVER AGAIN! No customer service!!! I will let everyone I know NOT TO EAT THERE!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and plentiful!  And service is always friendly.  Great place for breakfast, brunch, and lunch!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times I got a healthy choice breakfast and nice clean breakfast I like your food"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this neighborhood brekkie place. Even in the early morning 1 of my kids can get grilled cheese while the other gets French toast- I feel healthy with an avocado toast order and my hubs loves the eggs... efficient service. Good coffee and even if we encounter a wait- it's never too long."}
{"text":"Great breakfast...new favorite place.   Seated quickly, breakfast came fast and hot.   Belgian waffle was great and had cherry topping on the side and I ordered the chicken sausage and loved it.  Good coffee friendly staff will be back!"}
{"text":"Skimpy portions, undercooked eggs and burnt coffee were all surprising as we've had good experiences before. Service was solid!"}
{"text":"Wow, I almost forgot about this place - and its really a great place for breakfast. I used to frequent the location downtown all the time.  This location is much newer and uses the same fantastic ingredients. The \"Trifecta\" was my favorite.  For the record: First Watch is: \"good food, from good people\"."}
{"text":"I have been here half a dozen times, ordered something different during each visit and have never been disappointed. You will find fresh ingredients in outside the box breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"What I love about First Watch is their consistency in food quality and service no matter what location you visit.  I have a job that takes me all the way to Scottsdale and back to Phoenix on a regular basis, and every time I see a First Watch I get excited!  Every dish is delicious!  You can tell the ingredients are fresh, I especially love their avocado toast and breakfast tacos!  Coffee is always just right and they keep your cup full.  Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Great menu! The waitstaff is attentive. The food is great. I had the chorizo omelette and the lemon ricotta pancakes. It was outstanding. Definitely a great change from the other resteraunts."}
{"text":"Loved the pumpkin pancakes, I didn't enjoy the brand of sausage too much but did enjoy the male tonic and fake glow from the juice bar. Nothing like a good cold pressed fresh juice! The service was not bad but not stellar. Was somewhat slow. Didn't ask if we wanted any boxes of anything. But overall my Tucson experience was good and so was my Phoenix experience! I will be back"}
{"text":"First Watch has been a frequent breakfast spot for my husband and I. We recently dined here for the first time ordering off the lunch menu... and found out they serve breakfast and lunch all the time! Awesome!  All of our visits here have resulted in great service and a satisfying meal. Something as simple as a great tasting carafe of water, and delicious coffee with flavored creamers available at the table. The food has always been great as well.  I usually order lighter options such as avocado toast (highly recommend)  or the BLTE... a ton of bacon on Multigrain bread with spring mix, tomatoes, and an over hard egg. Yummy!   Recently they remodeled and the place now has a fun farmhouse feel to it. It's a great spot to catch up over coffee."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The avocado toast was so delicious. I would definitely recommend. And the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! This was our first time visiting First Watch (formerly The Good Egg) and we loved it! Madison was our server and she was an absolute delight. Very attentive, professional, and all around a nice young lady. We do miss the Wildcat omelette! Bring back local AZ dishes!"}
{"text":"First Watch is a very good place for breakfast, above average not out of this world.  We've always had excellent service in over 10 visits to this location. The food is good and while the omelet portions are on the small side you can always opt for three humongous pancakes if you have a hearty appetite. The coffee is great too.   I still prefer Butterfield's on Shea, but First Watch is a close second. Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Its so crazy that I pass First Watch all the time because my groceries store is in the same shopping area. I received a BOGO free mailer and decided to try it.  We had a nice corner table outside which was really nice. The service was a bit slow as we were kinda forgotten about in the corner but to FW defense it was very busy. The food was delicious. Very fresh ingredients. I had an egg scramble with mushrooms and cheese, bacon, potatoes and toast.  It was really good. One suggestion, crisp up the potatoes a bit. The coffee was delicious and endless. I truly enjoyed my experience here and won't be waiting for a coupon the next time to try it."}
{"text":"I wish I could have been able to review the food. I was seated right away but that was it. No one came to take an order or even bring water for 15 minutes! As I was leaving I informed two employees of the issue. They just said okay sorry about that. Too bad I had to give my first bad review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is freshly made and tastes great! Warning the pancakes are HUGE as in the size of a large dinner platter huge. The kids pancake is the size of the regular menu pancakes. I love the melon cooler and the lemon ricotta pancakes are a perfect summer breakfast.   The service is excellent and it's often not busy. I hope to see this place around for a very long time."}
{"text":"I've heard there's almost always a wait here, especially for brunch, so I wasn't surprised when we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. My boyfriend and I killed some time at the Trader Joe's across the parking lot.   Ordered the avocado toast, which came with two basted eggs. I didn't think the avocado toast was anything special, but I will always like anything with avocados as long as it's fresh and it was. I also ordered a side of potatoes (because what is brunch without potatoes?) that I did not really enjoy because the potatoes were cut into pieces that were too big and I also had to add a lot of seasoning to give it taste. I'm glad the portion size was big enough though because I knew the avocado toast and two eggs wouldn't be enough. The millionaire bacon was the best part of the brunch. It was flavorful (and just the right amount of sweet) and crispy.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Why didn't I just go to the first watch off mayfield rd? Came here for a healthy birthday breakfast after the gym and I've never met the most uninviting people. I asked the hostess about a booth and she replied as she walked away from me she didn't walk me to my table just set the menus down at the table and left. My server didn't give me eye contact just asked me \"what would you like\" my response was what is your name? I later found out it was mike. What ever happened to hi my name is.....I'll will be your server today. Food....just ok but Lisa was very pleasant  Corporate saw my previous review reached out apologized for my experience and sent me a gift card. I am pleased to say my food and service was great this time around. My waitress was friendly and fast. I ordered the AB&J waffle of the seasonal menu. So I'm changing  my review from 1 start to 4."}
{"text":"After reading other Yelper's reviews, I was curious to see my reaction when I dined there with in-laws yesterday.  If you go on a weekend, go early. We arrived shortly after 8:00 A.M. and had no problem other than the screaming child the parents of whom felt the other diners should listen to for fifteen minutes while they casually finished their breakfast (Note to self...open a restaurant that charges DOUBLE the adult rate for kids rather than offer free or discounted dining for the little screaming rugrats.) (Note to parents....If you won't consider the comfort of other diners as regards your children, consider leaving the little sh#ts with a sitter or getting takeout from McDonalds like every other parent in the world.) Not a single diner at our all adults table screamed even once, so it IS possible to consider the rest of the room!  Back to timing: When we left, however the Mongol hordes had descended in such numbers that, as I donned my coat I nearly inadvertently elbowed a man who had taken refuge behind my chair  from the rest of the people waiting for a table.  Indeed getting out of the place was like trying to merge on a short entrance ramp in L.A. rush hour traffic!  The food: I was particularly intrigued by the bacon-cheddar multi-grain pancakes everyone reviewing seemed to love. Multi-grain is one of those innocuous phrases the definition of which is whatever the purveyor wants it to be.  In this case it means 85% to 90 % bleached white flour and  a little maybe bleached oat and whole grain white wheat flour thrown in to \"qualify\" for multi-grain. (Note the phrase whole grain does NOT apppear in the title.) Why bother? If you want to serve people diabetes on a plate, just do so, and don't pretend.  Nabisco doesn't call Oreos tofu, do they?  The bacon-cheddar component was just what it sounds like. Somebody threw hamburger fixins' in the mix one day and people liked it. As far as the pancake itself is concerned, it was no better than and likely no different than the box mix with the kindly old \"Aunt\" on the label. My \"Tri-fecta\" included a pancake, two eggs and two strips of bacon. The rest of the meal was fine, and the cake wasn't bad, it was just not as advertised, not all that great and therefore disappointing.  Kind of like a movie made from your favorite book.  I was already coffee'd out so iced tea, or, as it turned out, colored tap water was the beverage of choice. Another diner got a skillet type breakfast dish with everything combined into one dish and plated.  She said it was fine but left between half and two thirds of it on the plate and didn't ask for a take home container.  The two oatmealers seemed to like their oatmeal, and the turkey sausage plate was about half eaten by that diner. No one at the table made mention of their meal, so gauging was altogether subjective on my part. The help was friendly and attentive, although it was confusing early on, as our table was latteralled several times before one particular waitress became our server."}
{"text":"Three words, friends: Cinnamon Chip Pancake. Aka the perfect breakfast food. I'm waiting for tomorrow morning to eat another. Can't sleep! Thank you, First Watch!"}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast eater but when I do, my standards are off the charts. This place does everything right! LOVE this eatery. Try the Kale Tonic to start. I come from California to eat here."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location and we got seated within 10 min.  Everyone started showing up later so go early for less of a wait.  Has a small outside area, we picked first available and ended up inside. I ordered a new fall menu item.  The Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich - has all-natural pork sausage, an over-easy cage-free egg and Sharp Cheddar on a grilled, freshly baked biscuit topped with lemon-dressed arugula, mayo and apple butter. It came with seasoned potatos on the side.  This sandwich was so good!!! I could eat it everyday.  Service was good and the price was right (had a buy one get one entree in the mail). I will be back to catch this sandwich before it's gone.  I think this should be a part of the regular menu. Who ever came up with the pairing of flavors on this sandwich came up with a real winner!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing how busy Matt's Big Breakfast was! Virtually no wait here. Got seated all the way in the back. My only complaint about that was the back wall has a long bench that multiple tables share, and there was a little girl next to us that kept getting up, sitting down, getting up, sitting down, so the slats on the bench kept moving. Pretty annoying. But they left before long and a new group sat down that remained pretty still. Our waitress was very friendly and spoke in a calm and happy tone. But she used some weird phrasing and kept making odd jokes. So I guess she was almost too friendly and we thought it was strange, but also entertaining. I ordered the Tri-Fecta with a waffle, scrambled eggs (well done), and bacon. The food came out quickly and everything tasted fresh. Eggs were cooked right. The waffle even came with a side of mixed berry compote that was good. I also tried some of the bacon & cheddar pancake my friend ordered with his meal. It was REALLY good! Savory and delicious. We ended up taking half of it home. If we make it back here, I'd like to try the Floridian french toast... it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Pricey..pricey...pricey.. average breakfast food. IHOP a much better choice at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a very nice neighborhood restaurant with a unique menu.  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was really good.  The service was quick and I will totally go here again."}
{"text":"If you want your eggs fully cooked on the eggs Benedict be sure to tell them when you order.  They serve some dishes on a very small plate that looks good but is not practical.  Fresh juices are good.  Always nice and I keep going back."}
{"text":"It's really just okay. You seem to get less food than you would expect from a similar place. Coffee is good, food is good. Just nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy breakfast! They are slammed on the weekends, so get there early or be prepared to wait. Pancakes are great, omelets are great... have never had an issue with service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service had a little bit of a snotty attitude. Would def try again tho"}
{"text":"First time visit. Sunday brunch here. Amazing! We gave up waiting at Matt's big breakfast down the street. This place is a pleasant surprise. No wait @ 12:30 on a Sunday. Nice staff. Nice decor. Relaxed vibe. Food was awesome! Highly recommend the ham and gruyère melt with tomato soup! So good! We're definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. The food is delicious, unique, and presented in a manner that wows the customer. The service is top notch as well."}
{"text":"I stopped into First Watch today for lunch. I've been through many times before but never mid work day. I was a little concerned, as I was pressed for time but they were so quick! I ordered the lunch specials, half salad half sandwich and it was just $7, and a great option! Chicken avocado salad and club sandwich. The waitress even brought me a cup so I could take coffee to go. All in under a half hour. I love this location and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Of all the local breakfast joints in the east valley, this is by far my favorite!  Great prices.  Great service.  Healthy-Human-sized portions.  Quality ingredients.  Delicious specialty juices.   And if you're an ambiance person, this Hardware Restoration inspired space grounds a sense of calm on a busy morning."}
{"text":"I was looking for a reasonably priced brunch spot near the ASU campus so I decided to try First Watch in between classes. I have to say, the food was much better than I was hoping! I had the roast beef and havarti sandwich with tomato basil soup. It was delicious!! The Parmesan crusted sourdough is making my mouth water all over again as I am typing.  I also tried their Morning Meditation juice which has beets, orange, organic ginger, lemon, agave nectar, and turmeric- just what I needed as a mid-morning pick-me-up.  In addition to their yummy food, they provide great service! Our waiter Manuel had great vibes and was so helpful."}
{"text":"This is a trendy cafe perfect for breakfast. Prices are decent. They support local farmers and the food is delicious. They also have pure maple syrup!!!"}
{"text":"Kayla is our favorite server--she is so attentive and friendly! She's the best! The food is amazing and you'll definitely come back again!!! Their biscuits are amazing, so the new fall farmer biscuit sandwich is a must try! :)"}
{"text":"Place is pretty new. Only heard of it through a friend, but friendly staff and very helpful. Love their get-it-yourself toppings. Can't wait to try their fry sauce"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Everyone always has a smile and willing to stop at your table to make sure everything is ok even if they are not assigned to your table.  They make fresh made muffins daily. The food is healthy and delicious.  I love their house made granola.  Every time I go I want to buy a bag of it to take home. Maybe one day."}
{"text":"This is exactly what it appears to be, a very good breakfast/brunch place, with good coffee, outstanding breads, fresh ingredients, well cooked dishes. I had the Elevated Egg Sandwich and it was first rate. The place was busy but the wait was worth it and we will return soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've had the salmon Benedict twice and both times the dish has cold which I wasn't expecting."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful but I wish there were more unique vegetarian options.  The very best experience we had was with our server J J.  She was phenomenal.  Very kind and good natured, attentive but not hovering.  She did everything to perfection and mind you we ate breakdast at 830 am on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Could not ask for a better menu of great choices. Everything about this place is quality, especially the server Corrie who was remarkable, even while she was training a new person. The food was quick, tasty, and filling. The plate appeared delicious and even the coffee was great!"}
{"text":"Not very pricey, awesome/prompt service, delicious food, and good presentation. Also, the coffee was great! Would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"I had a difficult time deciding on one item because everything I watched coming out of the kitchen looked terrific,  but I  settled on the Chicachonga and I was not disappointed.   Chicken,  chorizo,  avocado, egg,  cheese and an amazing sauce perfectly cooked and beautifully served.   The service was excellent too.   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but unfortunately the service is not good. The first time I dined in it took at least ten minutes and me asking for a waitress for one to take my food and drink order. The second time I walked in and waited for someone to seat me. While I was waiting, three separate parties came behind me to pay, were taken care of and out the door before I was seated. Either they are short staffed or need to get their priorities figured out."}
{"text":"\"Wow!\" That was my first impression of this place. The food is perfectly balanced. I got the avocado toast, my sister got the AM Superfood Bowl and my mom got the Pork Belly Bacon & Grits. I highly recommend the AM superfood Bowl, it's a light and filling meal, the perfect meal to start the day. Oh!, and don't forget their freshly squeezed drinks!"}
{"text":"I had a great brunch experience here, we came at around 11:30-12:00 and we must have just missed the breakfast rush, there was no wait time for a table for three of us. One thing that I absolutely loved about this place was their refreshing iced coffee! It does come pre-mixed so people who like their coffee black or unsweetened would most likely not like it, but I found it creamy and refreshing. I had the farmhouse hash and it was absolutely amazing, it came with bacon, avocado, eggs, potatoes, the whole nine and it even came with a small side of seasonal fruit and toast. The food tasted like it was made with fresh ingredients and it was warm and delicious when it arrived at our table. The service was friendly but not especially fast, I know that this place has been recently renovated and it looks great but there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to their specials board. It looks a bit sparse and unattractive; they should also include the ingredients that are in the specials and find a nice way of presenting it since the specials board does take up a lot of space on one wall. However, my overall experience here was amazing and I will definitely be back and I would definitely recommend/introduce this place to friends."}
{"text":"This is our favorite First Watch in the area. Efficient service, and the food is always high quality. They only have a couple of vegan options, but the menu is healthy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Highly recommend for something a wee bit different.  Healthy choices and some comfort food too."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Ordered the biscuit & gravy with eggs. Food portions was good, very clean and our server was very kind."}
{"text":"Food is good. Atmosphere is pleasant. Service was adequate. Prices are fair. Nice place to meet for lunch."}
{"text":"I was here 2 days ago...I thought I would write a Review....The Breakfast was outstanding  along with the Service.  Probably one of better places to have Breakfast....Thanks Michael"}
{"text":"Great Place for breakfast or brunch.  Excellent food, great menu.  great service"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service from Coleen.  Usually go to a different location (which is also awesome) but stopped in today because we were in the area. Happy to know the fabulousness translates to all first watch locations.  Everything is just so delicious and fresh - no matter what you choose you can't go wrong.  Thanks for always being so great!  P. S. If you like a green juice get the kale tonic. YUM."}
{"text":"My go to when I want a Healthy breakfast and I want it to be good. The servers are always friendly and the coffee pot is readily available.  The Millionaires Bacon is something that I hope they keep on the menu along with the latest addition of grits.  Only complaint is they no longer serve the Bacon Cheddar Pancakes."}
{"text":"I've become a victim of downsizing!! My favorite breakfast price has gone up and the serving has gotten smaller."}
{"text":"I've just realized I've never Yelped FW! What a tragedy!  FW is my absolute favorite breakfast place in the WORLD. Really. The food is seriously fresh and top of the line, the service is unbeatable, the atmosphere is friendly, comfy, and nice. You can tell that all around, from frontline to kitchen staff, the place is run well. My husband and I go to FW at least two weekends a month, and bring out of town family and friends here at every chance. Everyone is always so pleased and impressed, and jealous that they don't have their own First Watch locally (ahem, FWs are needed in Oregon!)  I'm having a hard time identifying single things to write about since I literally like every single aspect of the place.. One big positive: Tamara. She's usually our server and I feel like she goes out of her way to have us as patrons. She is SO sweet, friendly, and warm. We love getting her.   The house coffee: fantastic.   The waffle: stellar (do what I do and have the fruit from the Floridian French toast added to the waffle!)  The house potatoes: wayyyy better than regular hashbrowns.   The omelets: Incredible.   Tip: Sign up for their online club. FW sends me coupons on the regular and also sends me a free entrée certificate on my birthday. :D   Go to First Watch. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I decided to give them another try, ther service seemed more organized and on top of things which was great.   Only complaint is the water glasses still look filthy, I poured my drinks into a togo cup the whole time because the rim of the glasses on my table looked like 20 mouths have been on them...gross!  The gentleman bussing tables I watched is still putting used glasses back out after the table has been cleared.   The food was much better, I'd attribute this to the better service, running food as soon as it was finished.  Also I was pleasantly surprised the biscuit was much better this time.  Overall, this location still needs some work but is much better than my last experience."}
{"text":"The food was good but the waiter was extremely rude his name is Albert it made my experience there not very nice"}
{"text":"I have been going to First Watch since before I moved to the valley over 18 years ago. The location off I-17 was a stop on my trips from Tucson to Flagstaff and back. When I worked in Downtown Phoenix, I would go to one of the two there, depending on where I was working that week. So, I have been a fan for a long time.   This location has an updated look from the mostly standardized buildings they had used in the past. I think it is a nice new look. The place was mostly full when we arrived, but we we were seated quickly, and there appeared to be plenty of staff to handle the crowd.   There are many old favorites on the menu (Floridian french toast and the \"Bacado\" (bacon and avocado) omelette, I remember for sure) along with a bunch of new options, including the daily specials on the sign out front.   The coffee flows freely and is nice and strong, which I still appreciate after all of these years. I got my own little jug of coffee on the table: no waiting for refills!   I had a daily special, which was homestyle potatoes mixed with slices of beef brisket and a little maple barbecue sauce, topped with two eggs and served with a side of whole grain toast and strawberry jam. It may not have looked like much, and the beef was just a little bland on its own, but it was cooked well and the combination was nice. The jam was tasty and a nice complement to the grain toast. Be aware that the toast comes pre-buttered, and they do like to put it on a bit heavy, so if you like to control the amount of butter, ask for it on the side.  Our waiter was excellent and always available when we needed him. I feel bad for forgetting his name since he did a great job.  TIP: If you join their email club, you get a coupon for a free entree for your birthday."}
{"text":"This is sad to write, but I have to leave a review of this place of 1 star. We gave it 4 tries. After the 4th bad experience, I have to warn future patrons. Not only is the wait long to get a seat, but your money is not well spent. The food is terrible and the service has become horrible here. We complained about it after waiting on bacon and waffles for 45 minutes on the 2nd try here. Got a free meal and went back for try #3. Had to re-order the bacon and had terrible service on that try. No reason to try a 4th time, except for the convenience factor. If they get a new cook, or new mgmt, maybe this location can be saved. Otherwise, go elsewhere to spend your cash."}
{"text":"Knew I wasnt going to like this place the minute I came in!  Was starving from previous nights partying and was sat immediately, and given a menu with pictures on it(which I hate and is always a bad sign) that really seemed to be a random collection of items with a bunch of eggwhites and turkey products.  If you're going to serve only breakfast and lunch, it better be GREAT!  Potatoes I think were processed, awful and unappetizing, bacon was low quality, orange juice had a funky flavor.  Felt like food I would eat at a hospital cafeteria.  Only 3 bright spots were prices were low, eggs were perfectly cooked, service was good and place was clean, what should be the components of a good experience, but just wasn't good  Do not expect this place to be around for long!"}
{"text":"This breakfast place was a nice surprise.  The hostesses up front were very friendly and accommodating.  This restaurant is a little deceiving because it's Ina strip mall and my wife and I thought it was a bank, lol.  The decor and atmosphere is very nice and clean.  They have a fairly large space.  The service was great.  They have a great menu of diverse breakfast items, including healthy breakfast bowls if you desire. The food was very good.  Would definitely recommend a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfasts options. They have your classics and some tasty healthy alternatives too."}
{"text":"Been almost 15 years since I last ate here Had the Trifecta...... could have finished 2      It was good, warm The Millionaire BACON WAS SICK!!!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get! Waffle: $8.00 2 small eggs: $4.00 4 slices bacon: $4.50"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today with my nephew because I wanted us to try something new. I had the Trifecta with the scrambled eggs, waffle, and bacon. Everything was really good. The bacon was crispy, the eggs were cooked perfect, and the waffle was really delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love the seasonal menu and all of the yummy options. Choices for everyone from kids to picky eaters! They always seem packed so use the no wait app to jump in line, it will for sure save you time. I love that they give you a to go cup of coffee if needed!  Service is pretty fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm totally obsessed! To start they served fresh hot coffee, your OWN carafe so you can drink all you want! The coffee always is good, I didn't have any today. I chose to go with a Kale Tonic, it wasn't sweet and just so refreshing and delicious!  For our meals, I had the steel cut oats with no milk and a side of the potatoes. Which by the way, are not cooked in butter, so they're plant based friendly :)  One guest had the avocado toast, she loved it and I had a bite. Holy crap, so so good. I cannot believe I went all these years underestimating how great avo toast really is!  The other guest I was with had pancakes, obviously they were also delicious!  I know this is creepy, but I called later on to ask what was the whole grain artisan bread that was served with the avo toast. (Because now, I must prepare myself!) The nice woman on the phone told me if they have enough they will actually sell you a lot for about $7. SWEET!  The server brought out checks quite quickly and filled up my friend's coffee to go!  What I also love about first watch is their menu online is so user friendly to see the calories, sugars and fats. You even have the option to add or take out different ingredients. Most restaurants do not offer that additional option."}
{"text":"I visited First Watch for the first time recently and loved it. The food was great and service was excellent. Our server was so friendly. The environment is so cozy yet modern. Everything looked great, but I had the market skillet hash and it was amazing. I also liked their coffee and toast. We waited 10-15 minutes for 2 on a Saturday morning, but it was  worth it. My only complaint is that parking could improve and I wish they stayed open longer. Also wish they had a North Canton location!"}
{"text":"At first I thought it was me.  The atmosphere is really cool but the food is just average. It'snot bad but not off the charts. I appreciate their use of organic or local produce but it's lacking flavor for me.   I have tried more than once and couldn't quite put my finger on it till talking to others. Great concept just needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"Love the avocado egg breakfast.  Substituted gluten free bread.  Good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast on the 4th of July and the place was packed. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and our server was excellent and managed to take great care of us while running several tables. Food was excellent and plentiful and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to First Watch 4 times and every time the food was really good!  I love there fresh juice drinks , very tasty!   There salads and sandwiches are amazing,  I also had there French toast and it was good!  They use fresh ingredients there food looks good and tastes good!   You can't beat it for a good breakfast or lunch ,  better than fast food."}
{"text":"Thank you to the yelp tip for using the No Wait app. I put my party in line when I left the house which definitely saved us time when we got there. It was very crowded as expected on a Sunday morning. We were seated in about 10-15 minutes.  I started off with the morning meditation juice, which consists of orange, lemon, turmeric, and beet. The juice was pretty good and did not taste too beety. My friend had some coffee and had the kale tonic. She said their coffee was really good.   I ended up getting the A.M. Superfood Bowl which consisted of coconut milk chia seed pudding, granola, berry compote, and more fruit on top. I had never had chia seed pudding before and it was so good!! I am usually an eggs person, but the coconut milk made it super tasty. The consistency was like a tapioca pudding. The combination of the crunchy granola, sweet berries, and creamy pudding made every bite a delight. It also came with almond butter toast on the side which was nice but really not necessary. Did not end up finishing the toast because it was on very thick bread and the pudding was so filling.   My friend had the tri fecta and was pleased with the size of the blueberry pancake. Overall, a nice addition to the brunch scene in this area. A cute restaurant with some quality food. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Come early otherwise you'll be waiting but it is  well worth the wait.  Avocado toast is awesomeness so is the multigrain croissant breakfast sandwhich.  Always good service...and filtered water to boot."}
{"text":"Food is quite good, very fresh and good selection. However, environment is not great for kids (at least on a Sunday AM). I have 4 young ones, they get a little squirmy and it's difficult to keep them entertained when the place is so busy (and food & drinks are a little slow to come out).   Perhaps will visit on a weekday and re-review..."}
{"text":"I am no fan of large scale chain restaurants...more of a mom and pop kind of guy. However, this place was recommended to me and was good; good customer service, wide selection of breakfast foods. Negatives; a little too high end for a breakfast place for me. more of a modern spin on the classics, limited selection, and was not amazing, just good."}
{"text":"I have know been here five times and 4 out of 5 times left disappointed.   The service is fair, but the cooks are awful.   It absolutely blows my mind how a restaurant can be so consistently awful in their food preparation and cooking skills.   How hard is it to fry an egg to a customers liking.   This location can't seem to get it right.  If an egg is requested to be medium hard and every time comes out over easy then we have a problem.  In addition the sausage or pancake is also always cold, without fail.  This place needs new management with proper training and coaching.  It's an absolute shame that even when there is only 3 people in re restaurant they cannot get it right.  I give up and will never return.  The only bright side is they are very good at apologizing, obviously they have a lot of practice doing it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Any first watch is amazing. Anything on the menu is delicious. I just wish they still had their bacon onion hash. Please bring it back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch one Sat around the holidays. It was so busy. We were slightly irritated at first because it took around 20 mins before someone came to take our drink order. The table next to us was sat mins before us and we're waiting as well.  3 waitress were in our area and none of them made eye contact with us or got our drink order. Finally someone came and got the drink order at the table next to us and then immediately left to get thier drinks (instead of saving a trip and taking our order as well) when we finally got service it was good. The food was delicious. We got the lunch 1/2 deal. I got half a sandwich and 1/2 a salad. Lots of flavor and a nice presentation. I think the place needs to be open for a while to get the service down. It's a cute rustic farmhouse restaurant. We plan on going back once the new crowd dies down. We definitely want to try out the breakfast menu. It looks amazing."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional and the food was perfect. My husband and I will definitely be returning to try more menu items."}
{"text":"When a restaurant gives me enough time after I'm seated to read the menu cover to cover, twice, and then start looking for anyone to serve me, I'm pretty sure this place has more customers than they need or want.  Everybody can have a bad day, but three or four waiters and waitresses looked me in the eye, and simply made other decisions. Dirty dishes on an empty table are their priority?.  Bad choices."}
{"text":"Yum! Such a good breakfast/brunch spot. With how great our breakfast options were, I'm sure the lunch is fantastic too. I live in the city - but would definitely travel to the south hills for this. My biscuits with turkey gravy were a big hit - I don't usually get to have biscuits and gravy as most places serve it with pork or beef gravy (which I don't like)! The iced coffee was also on point - creamy and delicious. I love the ambience and vibes of the location. Even for a Sunday morning, we didn't wait more than 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"This is the second First Watch location and I've been to and it didn't disappoint. A lot of healthier options and the food is very good! If you are an iced coffee lover, make sure to have one here - I'm not sure what they add to it, but it's served creamy and delicious. Be prepared to wait at breakfast/brunch time on the weekends, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Nothing that special for me. Pancakes missing something, English muffin sour dough, temperature of food not hot, bacon cold was sitting not fresh."}
{"text":"Frankly when I Yelped first watch and saw all the 5/5 star reviews I was VERY confused. It has a very average updated diner vibe (think Denny's with a bit of class).  I went this morning around 10:30 and I have to say I won't be back any time soon.  PROS:  VERY good service, the waitress was very attentive and happy to bring us whatever we needed.  Easy to find, right off of Thomas a crossed from the hospital. Plenty of parking. Good prices, about 8-10$ per entree. Nice sized portions as well.   CONS: Let me first say that the coffee was not good. I am an avid coffee drinking but by no means am I a coffee \"snob\". Im not sure what was up with this coffee but it was so bitter it felt like it was coating my teeth and mouth to the point that I could no longer drink it.  However, for the record I did not ask for a new cup and Im quite sure that with 5/5 stars not all their coffee could taste this way.   The food was (as my grandmother would say) nothing to write home about.  I got the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy (came with a side of potatoes and eggs of your choice-I got poached).  The eggs were sitting in a little bowl with a small collection of water at the bottom (they were cooked perfectly though). The gravy and potatoes were good.  However, the advertised the biscuits as being homemade and they were rather dry.  While I'd give the service a 5/5, I'd have to give the food a 2.5/5.  With all the great breakfast and brunch spots around the Valley I wouldn't bother wasting your time or money at First Watch : |"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I had the BLT Eggs Benedict. The bacon was amazing, of course there could have been more of it. The eggs were spot on and the homemade bread was an excellent substitute for English muffins.   Tip: DEFINITELY sign up for the nowait app and reserve your spot. Even then there may be a little wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I loved this place! They had some kind of granola bowl that was to die for. It had chia-coconut milk pudding, fruit, granola, and perhaps some almonds or something like that. The toast was thick and amazing. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and really liked the idea of a community table. You don't see that often in Phoenix. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and wonderful location. The restaurant is always clean and has a nice large waiting area. being able to check in via mobile app (Nowait) is awesome as it can get busy on the weekends.   I always get the Omelette's. particularly the Works, with potatoes. quality food and overall wonderful place."}
{"text":"It's our regular Sunday joint! Fan of the omelette's and potatoes. Make sure to download and use the Nowait app for iPhone because Sunday lines can take a while to wait!"}
{"text":"Definitely over-rated. I'm from a big city and eaten in lists of small city diners which offer better breakfast. Portions small, dry pancakes and very busy. You can just throw some nice green vegetables on a plate and call it a good breakfast. Keep driving by - though it is in a real cool area with shops etc"}
{"text":"Two stars for location, but one for food, unfortunately! \"How was your breakfasts?\"-- a question never asked.  Not by the server who asked us of we both wanted boxes (having observed so much food left on our plates), and not asked by the checkout cashier either. Too bad, because we were ready to tell them: Potatoes vastly over salted; crab omelet (the most expensive item on the menu) tasted so \"off\" we had no desire to finish it, the amount of the special hollandaise sauce was small, and the sauce likely canned; toast full of grains (some may well like this), and strangely the \"butter\" remained unmelted even though it was thinly spread and the toast was warm.  Otherwise the food was terrific! Very disappointing, in that we just moved to across the street, and hoped to walk there every morning. If they had just asked \"how was your breakfast\" we would have been pleased to give them constructive feedback.  As is, we are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I've been to First Watch only three times but each time has been excellent! I love the avocado toast with eggs...amazing amount of avocado and the bread was phenomenal. I don't usually care for toast; however this thick whole grain toast was so flavorful I ate it crust and all :-).  My first time there I had a burrata cheese toast and loved that as well; however I didn't see it on the menu the last two times (I believe it might be seasonal). The service has always been great, with friendly and personable staff. I highly recommend First Watch on Camelback."}
{"text":"We visited this place on our way home from a thanksgiving getaway. Wait times were short, and the food was incredible.  I ordered the Acapulco Experess ($9.29), and it was the most perfectly made omelet that I have EVER had.  Mother had biscuits and gravy since they had turkey sausage, stepfather ordered the same.  Would come back anytime I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food, really kind employees and fast service. One of my favorite breakfast places ever. A personal favorite meal is the traditional breakfast that comes with eggs their amazing potatoes, choice of bacon, pork sausage or turkey sausage and toast! Although it is pricy, it's worth it too me!"}
{"text":"I went during lunch for their annual \"Free Omelette Day \", and to support St.Vincent De Paul.   I was surprised there wasn't a long line.  You get to choose any omelets on the menu.  Holly, my waitress was super friendly.  I had ordered the Bacado omelet, which filled with bacon, avocado, melted Monterey jack cheese, along with housemade salsa.   I thought the English toast was a little oily.  I don't know if it was butter or something else.   I usually like drinking stronger coffee, but the blend they had was pretty good.  It wasn't strong or too light.   The food came quickly and hot.  Ambiance is not much, but overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This places is terrible ! I was so excited for new breakfast place , but now I'm more then discouraged about returning . First the service was absolutely terrible . I ordered the roastbeef sandwich which ended up tasting like a cheez it . If I wanted a cheez it I would just go to Safeway . Needless to say this place is awful and best avoided ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in a long time.  Healthy and yummy!  Love the new decor and feel of the restaurant.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have to say.. this might be my personal favorite breakfast place in the valley now. We first came here on a Sunday after church for brunch, this branch was packed with a wait time of 30-40 minutes. This branch is small and it was too hot to wait outside so we left.  We cane back on a wednesday and we thought it was the perfect time, not much people were there and we didn't have to wait to be seated.  My husband ordered the Ham & Gruyere omelet, and the Millionaire's bacon on the side (I am not a bacon lover butthat one I have to say was reaalllyy good).  I got Belgian Waffles (it was the best waffles I have tasted by far, and I am very hard to please when it comes to waffles so this was super good I guarantee!) and the Florentine Eggs Benedict (as recommended by our server). The Eggs Benedict tasted a bit bland and I'm not going to orde it again, but I'm giving them 4 stars because overall service, price and food quality is amazing!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you want a great breakfast downtown but don't want to sweat your ass off waiting outside for a table at Matt's? Well, when presented with this dilemma today, I went with some coworkers to First Watch.  We lucked out on parking since my boss was willing to wait on the street for a while while some dude backed out of a prime metered spot in front of the door. Parking can be a bit sketchy mid-day so be warned.  Anywho, First Watch offers typical breakfast fare. I wanted eggs, breakfast potatoes, and pancakes, the combination of which is not available on the menu, so I ordered a la carte. The breakfast potatoes had the distinctive \"been in a steam table for a while\" dryness to them (it was 1:30 in the afternoon) and were devoid of any seasoning. My eggs were fine, although I was very disappointed in the private-label \"First Watch\" hot sauce on the table....it was flavorless and just gross.  The pancakes were decent--the batter is definitely homemade, although they didn't give me enough butter for 2 cakes,  and our server didn't really check with us so I never had a chance to order a second pat of butter. Oh well. I ended up soaking the pancakes in syrup so they wouldn't be so dry.  To sum it up: We probably should have just sweated it out and gone to Matt's. Mediocre food, mediocre service. One big meh."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place... we were not too sure what to expect.. we have had our share of disappointments ... but wow!! did this place blow us away or what..awesome food.. the Frittatas were heavenly and pumpkin pancake was the cherry on the top.. If you are in the Tempe area, you gotta give this one a shot."}
{"text":"Yummm!! Every time I get to choose where to eat breakfast, I pick First Watch.   I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, and the servers are attentive & friendly.   I always enjoy my food, whether it's the pancakes, omelettes or salads; everything is super fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great, new favorite! Everyone enjoyed their food. We had a slight issue and they resolved it appropriately and all was good. Only recommendation, the Millionaires Bacon is very good, but hard to justify the up charge over regular bacon and then adding some syrup and pepper to it. Get some thicker cut bacon and it would be amazing and worth the price.   We will be back again soon, maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a quick lunch salad. I recommend the pecan dejon salad. I have had it many times. There take out service is as good as it's sit down. Always quick and have not had my order messed up once. Ate breakfast there for the first tine today. Wow! Breakfast was yummy. I recommend the protein light breakfast, egg white omelet with mushrooms."}
{"text":"I am so happy there is a first watch closer to my house. I love there pecan salad. The service is fast, courteous and drinks stay filled. The food tastes good if I eat in or take it to go."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place that I've come to on several saturdays and haven't had to wait for a table, which is a bonus. It's usually busy but not overly crowded. I stick to breakfast so I can't comment on the lunch but the food has always been good and the service has been as well. You pay your check up front so you can leave whenever you're ready.   Their skillets are awesome, and the Trifecta with bacon, eggs and a waffle is always the right choice. Among the classic breakfast items they have some trendy healthy options as well like kale tonic and avocado toast if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in to eat here thinking it was still The Good Egg.The old sign was still up outside, but inside reflected the new name. When we walked in both of us were really impressed with the decor. The menu looked great as well, but sadly the taste just wasn't there. I got Eggs Benedict with turkey, and it was horried. I love Eggs Benedict and will usually lick the plate clean. I couldn't even eat half of this awful excuse of a meal. My husband ordered the breakfast scramble and was just as disappointed. The staff was friendly enough and the decor is adorable, but I would definitely not give this a second try. There are far too many delicious breakfast and brunch places in the area, for me to waste my time here."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I gave First Watch another try (at the Scottsdale Rd. and Thunderbird location) and the food and service was exceptional. The Bacado omelet was very good -- everything was well cooked and fresh. My 6 companions all enjoyed their breakfasts as well from many delicious choices. Service and manager were pleasant and professional. WIll definitely be back again. (I would have given First Watch 5 stars this time if they had more gluten-free items on the menu.)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Able to sit right down with no wait at 10am on a Saturday morning.  Service was good and iced coffee was fantastic.  Reasonable prices with a large menu!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at other First Watch restaurants before, and I think this one (being so new) is the prettiest!  Very hipster with the wood accents and open, bright setting.  All of the ones I've seen have a large communal table, in case the wait is too long and you want to grab open seating there.  I love the menu options (healthy and lunch options are both included, not just breakfast) and the food is always good.  It was super busy when we visited (Black Friday) but once our server got to us everything was smooth.  I think First Watch is the best of the breakfast chains these days.  We like First Watch and Cracker Barrel both, but Cracker Barrel is a little more traditional and less heathy.  I'd always choose First Watch over IHOP or others for breakfast, or even breakfast for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and fresh and healthy!!!! Can't wait to try one of the juices next time. Our waitress Courtney was so sweet! I asked what she recommended off the menu and she face an excellent choice. The avacado toast and eggs yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a few friends for brunch and holy cow was it outstanding!! I highly recommend the million dollar bacon and the fruit bowl! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Love that you can please everybody - juice bar to french toast and pancakes.  It's all good!"}
{"text":"As far as the service is concerned, there are no complaints. My waitress Nicole was very warm, welcoming and friendly. The new interior design is a welcome update  and the new menu is creative and has some nice changes. So why three stars and not four or five ? The portion was disappointing considering the price. I had the smoked salmon and roasted vegetable frittata with a side green salad and I just don't feel that they can justify charging $ 10.49 for such a dish. While the frittata was served on an oversized square plate, the fritatta itself was small and could have had some more smoked salmon in it and a larger variety of roasted vegetables such as zucchini and roasted bell peppers.  I have dined at other First Watch locations in the past and while the service overshadowed my breakfast, I was disappointed. There are simply too many other choices in the area to anticipate the likelihood of a future visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, beautiful environment. Had the inspired Italian omelette and it was very tasty...Not so sure that OJ is actually 100% fresh squeezed but tasted good nonetheless. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit où déjeuner!  Mon omelette the works est vraiment délicieuse.  Le nourriture est de bonne qualité et fraîche.  Le service est impeccable!  Une très belle découverte!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich was spectacular and the potatoes were seasoned and cooked to a perfection. I will return"}
{"text":"It's alright but not great. My husband likes this place I don't particularly care for it."}
{"text":"First watch is the only breakfast place we go to. We last went the Sunday before Mother`s day and it was great as usual. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious, not to sweet, just right. My wife had the smoked salmon omelette with fresh green salad. Everything is always so fresh and the wait staff is always pleasant. Like all good restaurants, it does get busy and can be a wait for a table, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm here pretty regularly for a breakfast meeting, so I've grown pretty well acquainted with the joint.  If I were rating it on service alone, it'd be a solid 5 stars. The waitstaff are always attentive and friendly, have answered questions I didn't even ask (thank you, psychic bathroom directions buddy!) , and know the menu well. They don't even bat an eye at special requests. No matter what size group we end up having, the servers and the kitchen both cope well, too, which is always rad.  The food, alas, isn't as standout awesome as the service. It's not bad by any means. It's edible and tastes good and comes out at the appropriate temperature. The menu's got a great variety. It's just not anything to write home about. If you asked me \"Where can I get a reliably decent breakfast,\" First Watch would be at the top of the heap. If you want a mind-blowingly amazing breakfast, not so much."}
{"text":"The commercials were so inviting we had to check this place out. The reality is that the seating is uncomfortable,  the food was served LUKE warm and because the competition is fierce we will never go back. Our server was sweet and efficient-she was great."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get breakfast, lunch or brunch ! I always try something new when I go and have never been disappointed, the staff is always very friendly and efficient. My favorite meal is the avocado toast and their iced coffee is the absolute best!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy and the atmosphere is awesome! Killer job a million times better then first egg!! The waitress was great told us two of her favorites we got them!! Very happy there avo tost is great!! Will be back over and over with they were open later tough"}
{"text":"I'll probably stop ordering from here. It's a shame because it's walking distance from work. My order has been wrong or they have forgotten something the last 3 times I've picked food up for take out."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is great, the price is \"Scottsdale\".... 3 of us sat down to a nice Saturday morning breakfast, the restaurant wasn't crowded and the background music was ok but all of a sudden increased by 6 decibels. Now we can't even have a discussion without screaming at each other. When asked if they could lower the volume, we were told the level is set by corporate and it can't be changed. What a disappointment to have to scream across the table to just have a chat with friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch last week after a visit to the zoo. I had never been to first watch before so it was all new to me. I have a 1/2 French dip and salad. The sandwich was loaded with meat thick and tender. The salad was equally delicious if not better. It had pecan and honey mustard topping with a vinaigrette dressing. My wife was not felling well so she had only a yogurt parfait. We ate on their patio. The service was average, the food great, the food was fresh and a good average value."}
{"text":"25 min wait on a Sunday is expected but an additional 25 min wait to get a waitress to bring water or coffee is just ridiculous.  One waitress came to the same table next to us twice while ignoring thne other three that were seated before them.   When I asked what the delay was all about I was told 5 people called in sick.   \"Only 3 people were running the place\".  Poor management of staff and bad attitude of the ones that are there? I am paying for ar service,  I am paying for food.   I realize issues come up,  but this is unacceptable.   The food is good if you actually get it, but not worth the attitude and the wait.  Go to the Bisbee Cafe down the street, better food  nicer staff."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place for breakfast. Plenty of egg and omelet dishes to choose from along with many other breakfast entrees. Decent coffee. Great service. Good location in Phoenix if you do business anywhere bear downtown."}
{"text":"Heck yes!!!!! I can never get enough of this place. It is soooooo good. No matter what I get it's awesome and the staff is so friendly and kind. If I could I'd go here every day. They're choices make me feel healthier, like I'm starting off the day on the right foot."}
{"text":"I have been to several locations in different states and the service and food is always great. It's definitely a great place for breakfast. I would recommend using the Nowait app to get a place in line before showing up on a weekend."}
{"text":"amazing healthy options. I loved the egg white frittata multigrain croissant sandwich and the kale tonic. Was surprised that they have international delight coffee creamers on every table.... not exactly fresh or healthy"}
{"text":"We came here on a trip from Utah and were not disappointed. The food was awesome, I would eat here everyday if I had the money. It isn't expensive and yet the quality of food is perfect. Our server was awesome and provided quick service. Should we return to Arizona, we will eat here again for sure. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I really love how fresh their food is! When I went, I had avocado and eggs and a fresh fruit cup. My only complaint is that they have the cup for coffee on the table (which made me think it was included with my meal and it actually isn't.) It's also pretty expensive for just one person to eat - for just me, it was $17 before tip! I couldn't believe it!"}
{"text":"Cold dry potatoes. Good bacon but cooked long before. Trying to be happening but they need get the food hot and fresh first. Service and attitude needs adjustment. Lots of potential but..... Went back and had breakfast again and found the service and food much better. Waitress was much less stressed!"}
{"text":"First Watch breakfasts are a little more expensive but use better ingredients than most breakfast places. We had the Avocado Toast which is quite filling, the works omelette which was quite tasty filled with everything, and the classic eggs Benedict which was good. The fruit was fresh. The potatoes were also tasty. The only complaint is that \"classic\" eggs Benedict should be made with Canadian bacon not ham. The flavor is different if you use the traditional ingredients. Service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I (varying from 2 to 8 people) enjoy First Watch so much we make it our weekly breakfast spot and meet there every Sunday morning, a very busy time for the restaurant.  The service - no matter the server - is marvelous -- friendly, welcoming, attentive without hovering, and patient with us, since several of us have food allergies.  The food is always well-prepared, and the atmosphere is wonderful, with comfortable seating and ample booths. We  can actually hear each other at First Watch, despite the large crowd that appears regularly on Sunday mornings.  That's a big thing for us.  One important thing of note:  the employees all seem to genuinely like each other - and none of them hesitates for a moment to help the others out.  I'm a former restaurant critic and I take special note of that, because when the help doesn't get along, the customer experience heads downhill quickly. They actually seem to have fun working together, and that starts at the top."}
{"text":"Been here twice in two weeks. I don't know where they get their avocados from but they're always so creamy and perfect. Definitely not the ones I pick at the grocery store. Last week I had the breakfast sandwich added turkey sausage. So tasty with perfectly seasoned and cooked potatoes.  Millionaire bacon is a must.  This week went with the chickichanga. So much flavor! Potatoes were too toasty and onions were completely burnt. But that's not going to stop me from going back and trying more things."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Love that this place uses fresh and healthier ingredients. The whole grain artisan bread and natural preserves are delicious!  Next time I will try the avocado toast."}
{"text":"The feel to this place was like ihop.  But the food was definitely not. I got the Trifrecta, everything was on point.  I loved the waffles, it was perfect. The maple syrup was light with blueberries not sweet, just how I like it.   My sister got the Tri-athlete, she said it was okay. Haha. That was her answer when I asked her how her food was.Lolz.   Our waitress was bad. Took 15 minutes to get to our table and our drinks as well. Smh. And why was she vacuuming while we were eating? Idk.   My sister and I agree that we will come back to this place. JUST because the food was good :)"}
{"text":"Friendly fast service, clean, and a good variety on the menu. My favorite was that mixed greens is standard with your omelet, and your own pot if coffee....AWESOME! Highly recommend this place! Also quick and easy to get to off of I17!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service and a delicious pancake; is there any better way to start a morning?"}
{"text":"Pretty good and an interesting twist on breakfast.  I had the quinoa with eggs and it was good.  It's more like brunch than breakfast."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes were good but why is there an additional charge for maple syrup? Cracker Barrel uses real maple syrup without an additional charge to the customer. The only other thing I disliked was the coffee. It was terrible. Also, the poached eggs in the Eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"*This was originally a one star review*   I've wanted to try Firstwatch since it opened. I went with one other person. Upon arrival, the server was short and didn't have time for me or my order, although there was no wait for a table and half of the seats were open (Her name was Shyla).   Beyond the poor service for a very slow Tuesday morning, I ordered the Elevated Egg Sandwich which was a complete disaster. My friend with me ordered as well. The first bite was good, until I had the horror of pulling out a nice long white hair with my food. I waved down the manager, and he proceeded to ask if I wanted anything else, and then took my plate away. I never saw the manager again, nor did he even apologize for the food quality. He never came back to check if my friend's food was ok, or to ask if she liked it.  My friend paid for her food, besides being disgusted by my experience to the point of not eating her own food. Still no apologies from anyone. While leaving, Shyla handed me a card for a free breakfast because, \"I didn't like the food.\" I am appalled at how this was handled. I wasn't rude to the staff or manager, nor was I upset UNTIL I saw how poorly they run as a business. I don't have any other comments about this horrible experience since the situation explains itself pretty clearly. I will not be coming here again, and the card they gifted me for \"not enjoying my food\" will promptly be thrown out in the trash.  Update 10/22/17 I received a message, (along with the response below this review) from Firstwatch on yelp saying,   \"Thanks again for reaching out. We are sorry you had such a disappointing experience and we take concerns like yours seriously. We would like to have our regional manager follow up with you personally. Would you please provide your phone number? Rebecca, First Watch Customer Service\"   I have received no response after providing my phone number, nor did I receive a message back. It has been 4 days. I didn't think they could make a breakfast experience from nearly a week ago even worse. Congrats Firstwatch, that's quite a feat to accomplish as a restaurant.  12/1   This morning I talked to the VP, who assured me I wasn't the norm as far as customer experience goes. He was very kind, and reassured me he was going to personally find out what happened. I appreciate his worry, nearly 2 months after the fact. Nontheless, I've changed my review from a 1 star to a 2 star upon finishing the conversation with the VP, simply because of his expertise in damage control."}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends today for breakfast. The food and drinks were delicious, staff super friendly, clean waiting area and restrooms, prices are adorable and parking is sufficient. There is indoor (booths and tables) seating as well as outdoor tables. The place was packed today and we waited approximately 30-45 minutes for our table. I like how there is coffee in the waiting area, along with newspapers and an advertisement about free WiFi. Attached below is a video of my experience.   https://youtu.be/zg8Q9AUgyyE"}
{"text":"One word: Bacado.  Bacon, avocado and cheese in an omelet.  Seems common place, but no other restaurant does it so well.  Breakfast and brunch only."}
{"text":"This place is just what Pleasant Hills needed.  It is charming, welcoming and the food is wonderful. I arrived at 9:00 on a Wednesday and there were plenty of open tables, but by 9:15 it filled up and was hopping with a great energy. I had the avocado toast and it was hearty and healthy at the same time. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A favorite go to for breakfast or lunch. We visit first watch maybe once a week. Service is always great and the staff are very friendly and attentive. I have never had a bad meal here. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious and they have many healthy options or substitutions many of which you can make without additional fees. The wait can get pretty crazy on the weekends so get their early or check in your party on the app \"no wait\" so you can show up when your table is almost ready."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for pick up.  They have a veggie sandwich that's excellent...my problem is that I can't eat cheese and the bridgeville location allowed me to substitute avocado for cheese.  This one has RULES.. and the rule to make that BIG switch costs $1.50 + a new customer."}
{"text":"Other than the atmosphere, I don't have too much positive to say about First Watch.  The eggs were disgusting! They were bright yellow and had the most bizarre texture.  You would have thought they were feeding the chickens fabric softener.  I had a carrot cake pancake, which i thought was a pretty clever idea. Unfortunately, it was multi-grain.  Let me tell you, a multi-grain carrot cake pancake is just a bit too much going on for me.  The service was fair but far from great.   Overall, far from a wow, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"this just became my fav breakfast spot in this side of town. Food very fresh, plenty of healthy choices and the service so spot on!! amazing for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been here a dozen times and enjoy it every time. I am making my way through the menu and there is nothing I would not recommend. They are fast too. I enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 star ratings, so this is a really big deal.    I was immediately greeted by a smiling female, Hannah. She's a manager at the Cranberry location, where ML and I eat before church on Sunday.  My server, Raeleen (Rae), promptly took my order and brought me a coffee carafe, poured a cup, and took my order. I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine, which I've had in their Cranberry restaurant. It was fresh, nicely presented, and delicious. They are consistently good.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, the spinach, tomatoes, and avocados so fresh, I wondered if they had a garden in back.  They bring coffee in a carafe, which stays on your table. As far as I'm concerned, they can do no wrong after that (there are days I want to use my EMT/Paramedic training, and hook up an IV of coffee).They also do the same for water.   I was able to talk with Rae, and Margo, another server, both of who told me they truly love working here. No need. It showed. Infact, Rae said this was her first time being a server, which was surprising; she's a natural. Margo was obviously  experienced and tremendous. Attentive, friendly, but not intrusive. The man I assumed was the GM never approached any diners, nor smiled, but everyone else had genuine smiles,and was very friendly, but not intrusive. Actually, the GM smiled warmly, as he held the door open when I left, wishing me a nice day.  This is casual place, but you'll feel very welcome and at ease dressed up.   It's\"s well-lit, and spacious, with solid wood tables and chairs,  nicely padded benches. I noticed and appreciated the reclaimed wood framed, tilting mirrors in the ladies room.  Their holiday promotion sweetens the experience. Buy $100 in gift cards this holiday, and get $20 Bonus Bucks. They come in any denomiation, starting at $5."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my 1/2 sandwich and salad!  The atmosphere is cute and the food was good. Our waitress seemed a bit distracted and did not ever bring us our to go boxes. We had to ask someone else.  Overall I recommend this restaurant. I will definitely go back. There were quite a few things on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here. I thought \"FirstWatch\" was a strange name for a restaurant- I don't really get it, but I like places that are different. My interest was piqued when we entered and I saw the coffee shop-styled waiting area- nice touch.  We arrived in the late morning and didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for a table.    I can't say I really like the ambiance- I don't hate it, but it has a bit of a cafeteria feel to it, only somewhat nicer.  But it is pleasant. I was told there is wifi there, but I would not feel comfortable sitting there with a lap top given the crowds and the noise.   The food wasn't anything special. My companion thought they must have been having an off day because even the hash browns, one of her favorite dishes there, weren't that good. She was very disappointed that I didn't have the experience she'd had here.    I'd come back just to see if it can really be as good as she says, but it isn't the first place I'd think of for breakfast.  In fact, I almost forgot I went there! Not a bad experience; just not especially memorable."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service is even better. This is my moms favorite restaurant and she goes weekly. I would not say I'd go once a week but definitely have no complaints."}
{"text":"I love first watch. I know it's a chain but their avocado toast is other worldly! And the lemon ricotta pancakes are heaven!!! It always tastes fresh and I don't feel terrible about my food choices after!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly people. Had the crab and asparagus omelet it was great and the million dollar bacon is the best around!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Saturday morning. Place was packed.  We had the best server Kendal  Our food was delicious.  Always spot on."}
{"text":"It is a chain of restaurants serving breakfasts, brunches and lunches . Food is amazing, fresh and delicious ! Service is very fast and the waitresses are professional and kind.  Atmosphere is very friendly and design is comfy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood this is. I was impressed by the attention to locally sourced and healthy ingredients. They have fresh juice-bar juices, left the carafe of coffee on the table and everyone was super friendly and helpful. Lots of smiles going on among the staff; they seem to be enjoying working here, so management must be doing something right! My coffee, food and check all came very efficiently. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes which were ridiculously filling and delicious. Looking forward to coming back often to try more! I'm a vegetarian and there were a good number of options for me."}
{"text":"Came here on a work trip in Solon, Ohio and it was the go to spot for the few days I was in town. Coffee is fresh and plentiful and they have a ton of options for breakfast food.   I went with the yogurt and granola bowl both days. Each day it was complimented with a yummy blueberry muffin and fresh fruit. Delicious!   The service was wonderful as well. Both days we had a different server and each kept up great conversation and helped with any recommendations we would need. Overall, a cute place with good healthy options as well.   Will dine back when in town."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast/brunch.  Waffles are delicious and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Meals made from fresh, locally grown ingredients. Can't go wrong with the BLT Eggs Benedict on toasted ciabatta with a fruit cup on the side. Yummo!"}
{"text":"I will admit, I have the same thing every time I go to First Watch: the TriFecta. It's not because nothing else sounds good...it's because the TriFecta is that good. I always tell myself \"try something different for once\", but I always end up with a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a multigrain pancake (had the blueberry today). Simple yet so satisfying.  Their seasonal menu always looks delicious, I've personally never had any issues with quality of the food or any servers. The prices are average, but it also isn't fair to compare cost and quality to other joints nearby since they're all different. I can't attest to the wait on the weekends, but when I stop in before work during the week, there is absolutely no wait at all.  The only thing that I would care to mention is that the iced coffee only comes pre sweetened and with creamer. Can't get it black. It's good, but definitely something to note.  Love this place, definitely need to get out of my box and try something different next time."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot!   Friendly and prompt staff.   Try the chickichanga.  It's great!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for First Watch because the food is so good! It's always filling and the prices aren't bad for what you get and the quality of what you are eating. This was our first time eating at this location.   The wait was awful. 1 hour for a table, didn't matter for inside or outside. We went across the street and visited a few stores while waiting. The food is that good and I have been craving their delicious coffee for weeks!   It wasn't communicated to us by our waitress that the iced coffee wasn't refillable. Therefore I was surprised when we received a bill at the end for 4 coffees instead of 2. Upon telling the employee at the register, she didn't seem to care and stated that refills were extra and was confused as to why we didn't know that. That was a bummer.   We will be back because we love the food, but the waiting staff isn't great. I'd consider driving a few miles further to try a different location next time."}
{"text":"New in town and we are having a lot of fun finding new places to eat. Definitely five stars for First Watch. You can check in online and that's a plus! Great place for brunch! The service was impeccable, the booths are spacious and comfy.. Not to mention the food is delicious, even the avocado was perfect! I had Eggs Benedict BLT with greens and it was soooo yummy! The bacon was just right and the hollandaise sauce was some of the best I've had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First visit to First Watch. I was impressed with the versatility of the menu. The traditional breakfast options look like they will please my big appetite, egg, meat, and pancake guy. At the same time I was really happy with the multigrain egg white sandwich. The avocado toast my friend ordered looked perfect, and they happily accommodated her very specific request for how to prepare the eggs. I look forward to working my way through this innovative menu."}
{"text":"Food is great.  However, the water glasses and coffee mugs were very dirty.  Leftover lipstick on the coffee cups and the water glasses were very dirty with lip marks and the water tasted like bleach. Also, it's very noisy so don't plan on having good conversation unless you want to yell."}
{"text":"Long wait on the weekends, limited seating for larger groups. Food was tasty, fun menu items make the experience. Service was OK, seemed like their waiting staffed was stretched thin."}
{"text":"Service stinks. No smiles, and no question for drinks for over 10 minutes.  I asked to keep a menu to order something sweet later, yet I still got my bill with the , \"no rush\" comment, without even asking if there is anything else we wanted. Bacon avocado Omelet was nothing special, was like IHOP, and the cheese wasn't even melted. We ordered a juice, which was good, but mostly ice. Next time we will be going to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"We love the cinnamon pancakes. The avocado toast is excellent also. Great service. The restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. We were greeted at the door and got seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and answered any questions we had on the menu items. We ordered the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy and the healthy turkey and we loved both. Who does not love comfort food that is healthy and tastes delicious?"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and saw that this place had some really good reviews, so I thought we'd give it a try.  We got here around 10:30 on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 30 minutes.  We were seated faster than I expected just based on the number of people waiting outside.  I got to chatting with some people next to me who are regulars and spoke very highly of the place, which is always a good sign! The food here was REALLY good.  The portions were very generous; they weren't kidding about the size of the pancakes.  I also liked that their menu had some healthier options- it was all heavy stuff covered in gravy.  I got a blueberry pancake and yogurt/granola.  I definitely could not finish everything.  The pancakes were fluffy and absolutely amazing.  Also, everything that came to our table was super fresh. Next time I'm back in Phoenix, I will probably make another stop here, but maybe I'll see if they take reservations.  Definitely worth it - and the prices were really reasonable too."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but sadly the two times that I went I was served cold breakfast. The first time they were kind to reheat. Second time I am sure they would of done the same. But I just had it and simply smiled and didn't say anything to our waiter about my breakfast being cold, just smiled and paid for my dish. But never returning, sad because the place is clean, friendly and tasty dishes.  Side note my friend did not get cold breakfast the two times I came with him. However customer near did experience cold breakfast. Maybe make it clear that you want them to make sure that your breakfast comes out warm."}
{"text":"First time at this location. It's nice to finally have a breakfast place in this location. The food was great. Their healthy options are pretty standout compared to similar restaurants. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service. the food was served hot and fresh the home made jam on delicious bread."}
{"text":"I have been there and received great customer service but the second time I went there was horrible. We were there for about an hour, was sat down outside and our waitress was poor. It took forever to get our drinks and we were waiting so long that it even took long to get refills. About an hour later the waitress came over to say that they 'lost' our ticket and that our food had not even been cooked yet! Despite many times she came over saying it will be right out, and silly me thinking she was actually checking on our food- she wasn't. I was so appalled by this service that we just chose to leave and proceeded to call the manager on our way to eat somewhere else. This was unacceptable service that our food was never prepared in the hour we were there. I will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"Went with the server recommended item for breakfast. It was great with potatoes and fresh fruit. Service was great but the restaurant was Ice freezing cold"}
{"text":"This place was great. We came here on Wednesday after our resort restaurant and other options couldn't seat us. The place was clean, the staff were friendly, and the food was excellent. You must try the Millionaire's Bacon!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from the East Coast and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at First Watch. We joined the waitlist on Yelp and were seated immediately when we arrived. Everything on the menu looked good. We had BLT Eggs Benedict and Avocado toast with basted eggs. The eggs were so delicious and fresh. They paired perfectly with the avocado toast - two thick slices of multigrain bread with a generous portion of smashed avocados sprinkled with sea salt. I tried the kale tonic. It was delicious and fresh. Our breakfast had us feeling energized for a good portion of the day. Can't wait to return and try some of the other offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it has always been great! Servers are very pleasant, food is fresh, what more can I say???"}
{"text":"The food sounds great and looks great but was inconsistent. The pork belly bacon and grits looked good but the grits were not flavorful. The chibbatta bread stick that can with it was crispy and soft deliciousness. The side of biscuit and gravy was the best thing though the gravy could have been hotter. The biscuit was moist and fluffy and the gravy was seasoned well and had a good amount of meat bits. The inside was warm and cozy with alot of wood accents. I'd give this place another chance."}
{"text":"First Watch on Camelback is pretty damn tasty. Great place to bring your well behaved pet as they can seat you on the covered patio. They offer complimentary coffee should you come and be asked to wait. I had a mother daughter breakfast last Sunday and the waffles are very fluffy and really warm your spirit. I ordered the biscuits with turkey sausage gravy. It was packed with flavor in every bite. My favorite part of my meal was the hash. I love a rustic flare on a potato hash brown. Big chunks of crispy potato, yum. The service was pretty good considering how busy it was. Everyone is giving the host or front house manager a bad review, and I honestly feel that many of you misunderstand his demeanor. The man is busy. He probably has to deal with asshole's all day who complain about a 10 minute wait or not getting a table at the window. He is there to take your name and seat you when your table is ready. Just get over the attitude and enjoy your meal! I took home the French toast for my fiance and he loved it! Big thick pieces of French toast covered in fresh fruit and powdered sugar, yes please! The only thing I wish they would change (and granted this might just be a pet peeve of mine) when I asked for sugar free syrup, they brought me the actual bottle of smuckers sugar free syrup (as if I purchased it at the store and snuck it in my purse). I just would have preferred it in a serving dish or something....anyways, can't wait to go back! Not the cheapest, but the quality is far better than any other breakfast/brunch place around."}
{"text":"I agree with Maggie R....this is nothing special....the prices are too high for what you get...."}
{"text":"food is amazing extremely great menu. i want to go eat there just writing about it. one of the best brunch places in the valley."}
{"text":"Three Tri-Fectas for breakfast, each a bit different.  The blueberry pancake was really good, the waffles also.  The pork sausage was savory and well-liked, the turkey sausage OK.  Service from Peter was excellent.  A nice atmosphere, recommend."}
{"text":"Good service although long wait but it was Sunday morning.  Coffee on weak side.  All our dishes were well prepared.  Would have like dishes cleared away rather than leaving our dirty dishes and bringing the check.  Ordered an extra giant pancake which was really good.  Loved the cute vintage milk bottle used for water."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing ! Everyone has to try the millionaires Bacon! I've never had breakfast this good so no one show this review to my momma!"}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered an omelette to go while I was at work. Usually I'm a bit skeptical of places that use link sausage in their omelettes but this one was actually pretty good. It's was pretty packed in there as well with multiple parties waiting for tables. Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona, I noticed that there are lots of great options for breakfast. And First Watch is definitely not to be missed if you are visiting Arizona for business or pleasure.  Food ordered:  Avocado Toast with Eggs- Yes it is simple but it is healthy and it tastes good and also looks very good. I enjoyed the freshness of their bread and the taste of the Avocado on the bread.   The breakfast menu is very diverse and the options are phenomenal here for the first meal of the day. The coffee was freshly brewed and it was one of the best coffee that I had. Only coffee in Hawaii can top the coffee served here.  On top of a great food, the service was top notch. The server gave me a cup of coffee to go without me asking him for it: Nice Touch."}
{"text":"A.M. Superfoods Bowl is delicious.  Service Great!  Ambiance & hipster vibe. I enjoyed the relaxed environment and something for everyone.  My daughter is a vegetarian so the A.M. Meal was perfect, but for myself, the Millionaire's bacon was worth the price tag.  Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Food and service are ok here. I order the eggs Benedict. The eggs were very small and undercooked instead of poached. Bacon was a little overdone as well. Not bad, but there are better options around."}
{"text":"Its very hard for me to write this because I love coming here for the food. They have many healthy options and the food is pretty fresh. I used to love the atmosphere and the service. The key word being used to. It has been a while since there has been new management and I feel that ever since the new management came in the quality in the service has gone down. There are times you will walk in and its chaos. I understand that there may be the regulars that go there that know many employees but they do get the majority of the waiters attention. I have gone and waited about 10 min for someone to come around and ask me if I needed anything or even greet me and take my order. I also am a regular in the sense I have breakfast there every weekend. Yet, previously the gentleman that was manager did a fantastic job of seating individuals and checking on them. I believe I heard he left to corporate which is fantastic for him. Also, I have noticed there has been a turnover in the employees. I saw the same people but ever since new management the waiters are different and to be quiet honest its not for the better. There are maybe one or two waiters that are great and one of them is Elijah ask to get seated in his area because otherwise forget it you aren't given any attention. Honestly, the quality of the service needs to be worked on. I would agree this is a more upscale IHOP which is the reason I come here. The food is great but be warned of the quality of service."}
{"text":"A healthy fresh take on breakfast/brunch! First Watch has a very comfortable atmosphere.   Two friends and I came here Saturday morning, the wait was long which is to be expected but the staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and water for anyone waiting. After an hour we were seated and given coffee and water right away. We ordered two different juices, the day glow and morning meditation. Both were very refreshing and tasty.   We ordered the power wrap, frittata rustica and the bacado. The wrap was healthy, light and delicious! The frittata rustica was absolutely amazing with several different flavors. My friend ordered the bacado but it looked like a lot of egg!   First Watch was a great place and I debated for 15 minutes on what to order because there were so many attractive options. If you're looking for a lighter but still satisfying - The First Watch is the place to go!  I only rate 4/5 stars because the wait to get our food once seated was quite extensive for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Had there 2 for 2. It was supposed to be a sandwich, salad, and soup. I came in as this was my first timer. Server andrew was very helpful. I ordered my meal from the cashier. I didnt get a hello from here nor he wasnt even talkative. Felt like I was talking to a wall. I waited 17 mins for my sandwich, salad, and soup. Tipped andrew since he was so nice to me. I checked my meal and it was missing soup. I told the cashier I ordered it from he said sorry and he didnt know I wanted it. Maybe if he was talkative and asked he would know what their customers want. Dont just assume. Kind of mad but i got over it. Ate the salad and sandwich it wasnt the best it was just a plain salad and sandwich to me. No flavors no nothing.. i wasnt impressed. Well wont be back this place is nothing exciting to see. Neither does their menu"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Good food and service. Wonderful menu that made choosing a bit difficult. We will be back to enjoy breakfast on the lovely patio again."}
{"text":"Decent.  A good basic meal with an attempt to be creative but falls short.  Clean inside but lacks personality.  First time I've been here, but I believe it is either a chain or franchise.  Had a utilitarian feeling."}
{"text":"Good, hearty breakfast food served in a modern yet rustic atmosphere. Staff is friendly and attentive, one exceptionally so was a server named Ellen. Ellen was caring and quick to help, she had a great attitude and made sure we were having a good time. If even not for the food, would return for rhe service."}
{"text":"Service here needs a major overhaul.  The manager is never present while allowing 13 year old hostesses to run the place.  It just doesn't make sense.  The wait is ridiculous right now but I think that's because this is the only breakfast spot in Matthews.  I've been 4 times now and it's just been ok.  The food has potential to be excellent but I don't think they have everything ironed out yet.  They just don't accommodate the crowds well.  We waited 2 hours last week which is pretty ridiculous but mostly due to the hostesses that didn't know what they were doing nor how to seat a large party.  Just not impressed operationally.  I will give them a break and try again in a few months maybe.  Hopefully the Waverly location has a smoother open."}
{"text":"I used to love the Good Egg.  The new chain can cook what is on the menu but there is no flexibility.  Their view of an omelet is different than mine (midwestern).  While they have eggs do you suppose they could make an omelet with eggs, cheese and ham?  Nope, not on the menu.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat I didn't want to pay for a breakfast at the hotel that j knew would disappoint so we came here and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Love it here :) we come here a lot, never a problem. Service and food are top notch. Never cold and they accommodate special requests, no problem. If it's busy use the No Wait app if you're impatient like me!"}
{"text":"The food is as good as McDonalds. The managmet team has no idea what they are doing. The place is dead and still servers can't get orders right. This place has a lot to improve on if they think they can be competitive in this area for breakfast. I may never be back."}
{"text":"JJ was one of the best waitresses my wife have encountered through the duration of our marriage. We absolutely appreciate excellent customer service with an authentic ability to draw customers back. What to go, JJ! We LOVED eating there a few days ago and visiting with you. You're a rare gem trapped in a very weak and dying customer service world. 100% A++++!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty freakin' delicious! The place is so cute and staff is extremely friendly. I had the traditional breakfast but it was so great and the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy were too die for! And if you have a sweet tooth get the French toast! Ask for Sierra she was so sweet and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast on Sunday. Got there when they opened. Water glasses and coffee mugs on our preset table were dirty; they had dried on food particle on them! When we brought this to our server's attention, she did not seem surprised and brought us new glasses several minutes later. When our food arrived, the second order of the day, our food was cold. How is the second order of the day cold?!  Service was mediocre, with two servers caring for 5 tables. After hearing so much about how awesome this place is, maybe my expectations were too high. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that although the food was cold, it was flavorful. However, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Our server Rachel was the best! Definitely recommend her when you come. I went for their breakfast and had an omelette which was the best! I added avocado. Drop by with a friend, family or significant other! It's perfect for any person!"}
{"text":"Suburbia in a restaurant!  Yes, FIrstWatch is 100% suburbia.  Oh it makes me long to quickly return home to Chicago.  Don't get me wrong, this is a nice restaurant, an excellent concept, a place dedicated to breakfast.  But it ain't spectacular.  The best thing about breakfast was this super-hot girl who could pass for sexy at any age, though I am guessing she was in her late forties...but seriously, she was pretty incredible.  Sorry to digress... but there's a point to be made.  She was the most memorable part of the experience, and I like food!  The food here is good.  It's worth going to eat here.  It's normal good breakfast food, but nothing more.  The omelets are prepared well, and there's a wide variety of them to chose from.  The eggs benedict are alright, but one can tell they are prepared en masse.  The coffee is good, I admit, for a restaurant.  This is an excellent idea I wish other restaurants would adopt.  I'd rather loose the points of service pouring my own coffee, than constantly flagging down a server.  I like how they just give the table a pot so that one is not constantly flagging down a server.    The service is excellent, and their lunch items did look enticing.  This is nothing out of the ordinary, and I like coming here.  I recommend it.  Remember, it is average, incredible average, but average ain't bad. Average is underrated.    Have an average day!!!! (There's nothing wrong with an average day.)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the healthier options here. The food was great the coffee was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the First Watch restaurant . This is our third time eating breakfast at this establishment. Last week I had a breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun with chopped greens, avocado, bacon, gruyere cheese and an egg. I enjoyed every bite. My husband had the avocado and cheese omelette and no complaints out of him. We also ordered two iced teas, and our meals and tip were close to a $30 breakfast, which is why I scored First Watch a score of four out of five.  I had three requests for my sandwich:  that that egg be medium pouched, the bacon crispy and the bun grilled and everything I asked for was not overlooked.  I'd certainly give it a try. The staff is very friendly and you will note by the crowd how popular this restaurant is."}
{"text":"We stopped in while visiting from California.  The breakfast was amazing!  I loved that I was able to get a fresh kale juice and the special was chilaquilas, which was amazing.  My daughters got chocolate chip pancakes that were bigger then their heads, which they amazingly finished.  Highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick to sit, good breakfast selections. My husband got the breakfast burrito. The sauce on it was a hollendace/salsa and he said it was different and tasty. I had a fresh fruit parfait and. Blueberry muffin. I loved the parfait. My little one had a blueberry pancake and he ate the whole thing! My husband and I love small breakfast cafes, so this was perfect for us while visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a wholesome breakfast that was delicious at a price that was incredible! This place was definitely busy but when you're good, you're good! If I'm ever in the Pheonix area again, I know where the best morning time eats are in town!"}
{"text":"Nice cafe in an out of the way area. I have had several meals here and they all have been good. Not only is the food delicious, fresh and nicely plated but the service is fast, friendly and professional. This restaurant is efficiently decorated with indoor and outdoor seating and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is part of the Good Egg Franchise, I recognized the menu. I had a nice meal, it was very fresh and received fast, friendly service. The quality of the preparation was actually a little better than I usually receive from Good Egg. It is a good location but I can see where parking could be a problem. I saw at least four restaurants vying for the same small parking lot."}
{"text":"First Watch was like an upscale, healthy Denny's/IHOP for older people.  There was a variety of breakfast items ranging from omelets/pancakes to \"quinoa bowls\" and watermelon cucumber smoothies. My husband had the decadent French Toast Monte Cristo which he really enjoyed and I had a pleasant but bland egg-white Tri-Athlete Omelet stuffed with mushrooms and sauteed onions. I substituted my English Muffin for what turned out to be a stodgy biscuit that wasn't worth the calories.  However, the homemade strawberry jam was!  Our waiter, Jared, was friendly, high energy and efficient.   There was an overwhelming number of senior citizens when we went here. Maybe this restaurant is near a retirement area?  Anyways, the First Watch staff were so nice to all the patrons with canes and health issues. As busy as he was, Jared even sat down for a minute to have a friendly chat with an elderly lady regular who had recently had some kind of fall."}
{"text":"This place appeared to have it all. The menu looked healthy and they even offered reservations via the app. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We ordered our food easily and that's where the problem began. We noticed other tables come in after us be served their food and finish before ours arrived. Nearly an hour after we ordered, our food arrived. It looked delicious but to our dismay both our skillet, with over poached eggs, and our beautiful lemon blueberry pancakes were cold. At this point we lost our patience and decided to go elsewhere. Our server understood and gave us a $20 gift card in hopes that we return one day."}
{"text":"I went to first watch the other day for the first time and it was great! The menu isn't for picky eaters, but if you want a healthy breakfast/brunch option this is definitely a good pick. It was a little busy but the wait wasn't bad and our waitress was not too attentive but just enough. I would definitely go back and I recommend their eggs benedict."}
{"text":"We have been to other First Watch locations, but this one was the best by far! The place was clean and we did not have to wait (surprising for a Sunday morning). Our server, Ellen was fantastic. She was very friendly; and honestly, the best part of our visit! She recommended great breakfast suggestions (that we took) and they were delicious! We will definitely be back and you should, too!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best breakfast I have ever had in my life.  The food was amazing and OMG I've been dreaming about that meditation juice ever since.  I wish I could have bought a gallon to take home!"}
{"text":"It would have been 5 stars but the service was not great. The host was awesome and he recommended some dishes so I tried the chickichanga and loved it. My server was very inattentive and not personable. We asked 3 different people for coffee creamer and we did not get it for 15 minutes so we were just letting our coffee sit while we waited and we also didnt get water to drink. Our food took a long time to come out but it was delicious."}
{"text":"I decided to grab a nice breakfast before I said goodbye to Phoenix and hopped on a plane. And First Watch was the best decision I could have made! Their toast was buttered and melting when it got to me. The bread was a thick whole wheat. The strawberry jam that came with it was very very delicious and sweet. My omelette, 'The Works', was really good.  It had a lot of adds ins but somehow they all worked really well.  The tomatoes tasted very fresh. I'm not sure how much I enjoyed the sour cream on top but honestly that was so trivial compared to how good everything else was. I got the potatoes instead of the side salad and those were flavored really well. You could eat them plain or with ketchup. They also gave me a large jug of cold water that was very refreshing. Also the staff was just fantastic! At least 3 staff members came up to me and made sure I was alright. I could tell that they wanted me to have a great time. Their service was remarkable and they were really going above and beyond! I'm definitely going to look for one of these in Michigan when I get home."}

{"text":"We loved this comfortable place the first time we went for its great food and friendly service. So we called ahead for a group brunch and everyone enjoyed it too!"}
{"text":"I had an egg-ceptional breakfast. Assume I said that deadpan.  It was a quality meal with obviously fresh ingredients. I truly appreciated the sense of gastric and spiritual fullness that fell over me on the walk back to my car.  4/5"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere. Always consistent and friendly service. The pancakes are huge! Many options for meat eaters and vegetarians."}
{"text":"The food and service was wonderful. Usually when you go with a big group things tend to fall apart, but this place held up very well! I'm impressed. If we weren't from out of town we would definitely be back! Everyone's food looked so good and nobody wanted to share LOL. That's when you know something is really good! :P"}
{"text":"I don't like to write a review unless I've given an establishment at least 3 visits. I've given First Watch a half dozen visits to get it right, so I believe this qualifies me to write.  The first two times we went for breakfast soon after they opened, and I would have rated those visits a 5. The Regional General Manager was in charge those first few months. He left. Then the steady decline began.  Each time the food has been very good, but the service grows poorer in direct proportion to the decline in proper management.  Our server was friendly and liberally threw around her \"Honeys\" and \"Sweeties\" to help us feel loved; however, her memory, for a millennial, was a disappointment. The dirty knife we were given was never replaced and the lemon for my water had to be requested multiple times. The last two times we dined there, we had problems with our receipts at the cash register---they wouldn't ring up for some reason unbeknownst to the cashier. And the manager had to deal with an angry patron outside the entrance--someone also disappointed with their service--so she was not available to help. I overheard the patron say, \"I'm thinking I shouldn't have to ask several times to get my order fixed...\". This conversation went on for an inordinate amount of time---one would hope the Manager would try to rectify the patron's concern. I hope the Regional Manager comes back to visit soon. Otherwise I see a vacant storefront in this shopping center's future."}
{"text":"I came in here in hopes for good breakfast. The drink kales tonic was delicious. But the bubbas Benny that I had wasn't as good. The potatoes were alright. The large amount of gravy basically masked the taste for sausage and eggs. On the brighter side of things was the staff did an excellent job of taking care of the customer."}
{"text":"New decor is terrific- and the service was good.  Had the Avocado Toast which I always get and never disappoints. The Iced Tea however wasn't the freshest.  I would hope they would choose the same Iced Tea as Pita Jungle - called Passport Coffee and Tea- which is a local (Scottsdale) business."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine for breakfast with a couple of great breakfast choices that are consistently good.    Restaurant is clean- including the bathrooms.   I love the large booths so you are comfortable and have plenty of space.   My beverage today was the new Chilled Pear Cider juice which was delicious.   I do enjoy the Carrot and Ginger juice drink but it wasn't on the menu at this time.   One of my favorites is the Smoked Salmon and Vegetable Frittata with a side salad which had just enough dressing - lightly coated so it wasn't heavy.   The Millionaires Bacon is super delicious- thick slices coated in a maple syrup.   Every once and awhile you gotta have this with your breakfast! (Or lunch). My friend ordered the Superfoods Bowl (which we had ordered before on a precious visit) as the portion was big and the Chia Seed Pudding was fresh.     At this visit we definitely noticed the portion was smaller which was a slight disappointment but it was still yummy.      Overall- a good recommendation."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  The Avocado Toast was delicious!  The restaurant was clean and our server Joanne was very pleasant and accommodating"}
{"text":"I was here the other morning for the first time and didn't really know what to expect. I love trying out new breakfast places but it's hard to find one that really keeps me coming back again.   Well, if you're not too sure about coming here, let me tell you now you should definitely come!  I was debating whether or not I should actually get a breakfast dish (which all of them seem amazing), but decided last minute to go with their power quinoa bowl with chicken with a pesto sauce (bottom right on the menu). My review of it: spectacular. An explosion of wonderful flavors with every bite.   Also, their coffee is amazing and not the typical bland flavor that other breakfast joints use.   This place comes highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"A friend raved about the one in Cincy, so we tried it. It's very 56 Westish in naming the dishes cleverly and having above average ingredients available for breakfast foods. Avocado, feta, and wheat tortillas to name a few. One might even say it has sort of a health food angle. Sort of. They only do breakfast and lunch. Lots of different takes on omelettes,salads, wraps and known for their French toast.  I had the Caps,etc. It's mushroom caps with 2 cheeses melted on them  with eggs and english muffin. Served with their patented First Watch potatoes. They taste like any old potato if you ask me. Caps were nice. Eggs were fluffy.  A little pricier than a diner,but comparable to IHOP. And a little bit more chic. Not a lot to do in that neighborhood except maybe go look at the river or pick one's nose. Or both. But if you're up that way, give it a try. The restaurant i mean."}
{"text":"Nice facilities but my breakfast was served warm instead of hot.  I had to rush eating so it would not be completely cold by the time I finished."}
{"text":"Update:  While I love the food, specifically the pancakes , you may want think twice about picking this location. Here's why:   I live down the street and frequent this FirstWatch nearly every other Saturday, still I've never once been recognized, acknowledged, or made to feel like a valued patron. The staff is genuinely unfriendly. They're not particularly rude, just not friendly or conversational at any level.   While surely one can understand they get busy, the service is lacking and appears to be without effort. They tend to forget about people until you're eating and don't want to be annoyed or it's time to pay. In addition the staff are generally inattentive and difficult to flag for assistance.   For instance, just this morning I was left with nothing to drink until my food came despite repeated attempts to try to get attention from multiple servers.   Finally, They rarely ask how things were or if you enjoyed your meal, with the exception of the moment  they bring you your food. Thus providing no opportunity for feedback or to rectify a bad experience.   Despite the poor service, I tip my hat to the chef and stand by my previous review. The banana granola pancakes are the best around, which is why I continue to return.  However, if you're not particularly fond of pancakes, in the immediate area, or looking for a regular breakfast spot, you may be wise to visit one of the many other FirstWatch locations or choose an establishment that appreciates its customers more and will leave you with a positive experience.    --------------------------------------------------- I am on a quest to find the best pancakes in the valley. So far FirstWatch wears the crown. If you're a flapjack connoisseur you must try their banana granola pancakes. It can be busy on the weekends, so try to beat the rush. However, a small communal seating area shortens the wait if you're with a small party."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't typically go for chains....but this place sent me a bogo coupon and I couldn't resist! It must have been fate because this place turned out to be legit. I liked that when you order coffee they bring you a full carafe....no waiting for refills. For breakfast, I tried their fig and prosciutto toast...this thing was so fresh and tasty. Toast with lemon ricotta, arugula, fig, and eggs.... perfect size and perfect flavor. The husband got a pancake which was good...maybe nothing special but fine. The employees were friendly and even gave us the more expensive breakfast for free with our coupon (we ended up paying next to nothing...it was fabulous!). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was.....not good at all. I ate here because the BF and I got to comicon 2 hours early this morning and needed to kill time and we were hungry. We were debating between going here and going to cartel..... Well we definitely should have gone to Cartel. We walked in and immediately we had to wait to put our name down for about 10 minutes despite the guy in charge of that clearly seeing us. Then, once we were seated, we waited about another ten minutes for anyone to even come by our table to ask what we wanted to drink. The coffee was metallic and not very enjoyable. I ordered the veggie omelet using egg whites and the BF got the chocolate chip pancakes.... The veg was not good.  They chose some of the weirdest veggies for an omelet.... celery? Who puts celery in an omelet? That's all I could taste and it was not good. The cheese also was tasteless. The potatoes that came with it were standard, not real flavorful, but not awful. The really shocking part was that somehow they made the english muffin that came with the plate completely bland. It really had no taste at all. It was like eating chewy jelly.... not good. Why don't they just go buy a pack of Thomas muffins if this is the best they can do, because those are much better. The pancakes were dry and bland, despite the chocolate chips. It was hard to swallow it because it was so dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is our go to place after church! So yummy and healthy. Use their app to get a place in line! Saves so much time not having to wait to sit down!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at FW numerous times over the years and can't say that we have ever had a meal that was less than great.  Breakfast is my favorite meal at FW, when I have a craving for pancakes this is my destination."}
{"text":"I have thoroughly and often enjoyed this restaurant for a couple of years but, today was a real disappointment. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Tostada, a specialty. The eggs were not even barely cooked. Lost my appetite but asked for a simple scrambled egg a-la-cart and it was worse. Waitress told me the cook was new. A cook who can't prepare an egg and a waitress unable to correct a mistake! She charged me full price for the Huevos Rancheros and did not even take the plate off the table. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting breakfast. Our server was phenomenal,the staff even took the time to explain the transit to us country bumpkins:) the only down side was that it is a little pricey as far as breakfast goes was around $40 for 3 of us."}
{"text":"I gave First Watch  a 5 star review  based on my meal at the one one Thomas.  Next I had another 5 star meal - the BLT benny on N scottsdale road near Pinnacle peak.    When I went to the one in Hilton village on scottsdale road I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning with out of town guests at First Watch on Thomas. Very nice experience.  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes.  So good. The others had the traditional breakfast or omelette.   All were delicious. The omelette could actually be split it was so large."}
{"text":"First Watch is my favorite local breakfast spot. I go their for business meetings as well as take my family.  They offer also have a lunch menu. I have a few food allergies the chef is always able to accommodate that. A friendly staff welcomes you in  seats you right away. There's never pressure to just eat and rush out. The lemon pancakes are delicious."}
{"text":"This is a popular spot for breakfast and lunch. While I've never gotten lunch here they do serve until 2pm. This is one of three locations in the area and is one of my usual breakfast spots. This particular location has a few outside tables however they are basically on the sidewalk between the restaurant door and the parking lot. There is usually a wait on weekend mornings for a table - inside or out. Personally I like the omlets however regardless of whatever you order the servers are very good about honouring special requests to sub things out or change the way something is made. Good coffee - they put a pitcher of it on your table if you order it (water too)."}
{"text":"From being at other locations, my expectations were met. Friendly fast service. Really good food! I got the Power Wrap with a side of fresh salsa. Really delicious, but simple. Neat, tightly made wrap with egg whites, cheese (Swiss), big chunks of mushrooms and spinach in a sun-dried tomato wrap.   I also got fresh fruit as a side and was pleasantly surprised to find each piece was edible - not hard and not flavorless as many fruit cups tend to be. Even the out of season pineapple was delicious.    Check online for nutritional information.   I haven't tried it, but they were advertising an app called Nowait that let's you get on the wait list before you even arrive and allows you to see your place in line when you get close to the restaurant and receive a text when your table is ready so you can be shopping in nearby stores."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. Carly, our server, compelled me to write a review because of how incredibly nice she was. My parents speak broken English and I can easily tell when a server is bothered by this. Carly never gave off a sense of being annoyed. Thank you Carly and First Watch."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot! Fresh food and the COFFEE  is the bomb you can only get it at First Watch, their recipe!!"}
{"text":"It's was pretty cold in here. The morning juiced beet juice was absolutely delicious. The menu had a variety of healthy meals. I was pretty impressed. I had lemon risotto blueberry pancakes .  This was the best pancakes I've had.  The flava just popped in my mouth. I will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Breakfast is very delicious and healthy. The service was satisfying. I've tried the same thing twice the protein pancakes . You don't even need syrup for these cakes they s"}
{"text":"It is a very busy place. They open at 7am which is good for the early birds for a pick up on the way to work.. I also like the app where you can put yourSelf in line during busy hours. I've been to 3 locations Tempe chandler and Gilbert. The food is great service is much better at the Gilbert location . So I continue to visit often.. I have not been disappointed with the food yet . I love the million dollar bacon  it's to die for. I'm off this week so I've been every morning..... love the morning meditation"}
{"text":"Took a friend to breakfast after church. It was busy, a good sign. Had the Acapulco (?) omelet. Very good! The pace of service is good and the hosts and wait staff were friendly. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing. So healthy and delicious. The entire staff has wonderful customer service. Our server Greg was one of the best servers we've had in a while. I had the kale juice and it tasted refreshing and natural, I loved it!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm good. Large parking area next door. Service was great Large selection of food. Large portions. Good food."}
{"text":"We love this place excellent food everything delicious , ratings  they were not wrong, staff were amazing, cleanliness, cool decor  will come back"}
{"text":"After running the Arizona Rock n Roll half marathon, we thought this would be the perfect place to stop. We were greeted by the friendly staff, and our wait was minimal. We started off with coffee, while we looked at the menu. I ordered the Tri Fecta, which was 2 eggs, a choice of meat, and a choice of a waffle or pancake. It was very tasty. All the food was very fresh, and our server was attentive. I would definitely recommend making a stop here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I came with a group and they couldn't get the drinks straight, brought food out at different times, and even missed components of dishes. There were several people who ordered the same thing but one would be missing the cheese that was supposed to be on top of a salad or the other missing a side dish. When we asked they seemed very confused.   The food was nothing to write home about either. I got a grilled vegetable sandwich-supposed to be bread, cheese, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, pesto. It was a bread and pesto sandwich-I could count the number of veggies total on one hand.   Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"New location is awesome. Went for breakfast and all was clean, spacious and open. Food was delicious and service was good.  Booths are big and have lots of space. They made an error on the bill but fixed it with no hassle. I had chorizo omelet and it was delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food! They have classic options, and health options. The Kale drink everybody talks about really is delicious. I had the quinoa breakfast bowl - also delicious. My husband got the biscuits and gravy with turkey sausage and we were both pleased and impressed that it's much lighter than the dish is normally, but fully flavorful.  It was a Saturday at the top of lunch hour and the place was busy, but our service was friendly and on-point."}
{"text":"Kiss my grits! They have em, and they come with bacon. What can be better than that? This almost derailed my diet, but I was a good boy and left it alone until bacon is back on my menu, What I did get were the country potatoes. Nothing out of the ordinary, but as good as any. I came in for a light bite and they filled the void, The restaurant was nicely decorated with a country theme. The service was prompt and friendly. The prices were just above average. I will return when I can get the grits and bacon breakfast."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! My husband and I had to try this place out as soon as we heard about it. When we arrived, there was already a waitlist, but we took that as an excellent sign because it was around 11 in the morning on a weekday and the breakfast crowd would have already been there. The million dollar bacon- OMG!! It is to DIE for! My husband keeps talking about it so it has made the list of \"give me the usual\" items. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and let me tell ya, delish!!! Hubs ordered the French toast and he devoured it with delight. The coffee is so, so good and they bring it to you in a carafe so you can help yourself with top offs. Our server was very friendly and made us feel quite welcomed. This place is a gem and I am so happy to have it nearby!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place isn't rated 5 stars! I can't even think of anything bad to say about it! Menu options are incredible, food was phenomenal, ambiance is quaint and lovely, and service was friendly and efficient. Love love loved everything about our experience!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Sara was our server and she was friendly and took great care of us. The food was great for all five of us. Great healthy and vegetarian options. Kale tonic was delish!"}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago and ordered the chilaquiles. I found a hair in my beans *gross* and so I focused on just trying to enjoy the other part of my meal. It was literally so spicy that it wasn't good. Now, I love Mexican food and hot sauce but this was almost inedible.  I figured I would give it another shot this past weekend. I ordered the pumpkin pancake plate. First, their food isn't nicely plated like it used to be. Second, my \"scrambled eggs\" were actually over medium and then scrambled. Third, my apple chicken sausage was cold. Not like it sat under the heat lamp cold. Literally like it was pulled right from the fridge and stuck on my plate. No joke. I usually don't send food back but I did get another side of sausage. Still, very disappointed in First Watch. I'll be going elsewhere from now on. Bummer, because they used to be delicious and consistent."}
{"text":"Good food, but don't come Sunday late morning.  They pack you in like cattle. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Love First Watch for its food and service but can't, in good faith, give it any more than 3 stars because of its prices. OMG, I have to save up to come get some avocado toast and eggs...Too much."}
{"text":"Just returned to the Phoenix Metro after many years away. Spent some time trying to find The Good Egg. Went to this location looking for said and found the most phenomenal restaurant in First Watch. Food, service, comradery were top-notch and better. Will return often."}
{"text":"We come here about once a month and each time we go we enjoy the food and the service. We rarely have a wait but the weekends are clearly more crowded than the weekdays. However there is a wait list link from yelp that allows you to put your name on ahead of time....nice!!! They have a variety of food from healthy high protein options to scrumptious high calorie confections. The bread and the baked goods are fresh and delish. The salads are usually a spring mix and they have a nice vinaigrette they put on a side salad I like it quite a bit. I would highly recommend this location as the customer service is second to none."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's a huge step up from the good egg, which was there before. The food is better the coffee is better, I love this place. I'm really glad to have it closer by."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place is crowded. It's always 30-45 minute wait any day of the week. Service was ok. Food was only ok....nothing unique about it. We love going out to breakfast but will not return here. You have to download an app to get on the waitlist. Not worth it"}
{"text":"I'll be honest: First Watch helped me get through the morning at work after a very light night of drinking. The quinoa and veggies with eggs were great, as was the green juice I had.   I've also been here to pick up breakfast to go on normal mornings and the options are pretty good. They do a good job of getting the food out to you quickly. While I probably wouldn't come on my own if I lived in Phoenix, I do enjoy coming here when I'm traveling for work."}
{"text":"This is a three and a half for me, but I rounded up.  A four for the fantastic service, menu selection, yummy coffee ( with a  whole pot on the table!) and healthy options.  A three because the food was just a little average.   I was so excited to order the avocado toast because of well, avocado.  The dish was beautifully plated with the toast (whole-grain bread, avocado, and sea salt) and two over easy eggs.   I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to add flavor.   Husband ordered a ham and gruyere omelet which he said was fairly devoid of flavor.  I'd still love to come back, because there were some other options that looked delicious.  Plus, there was no wait and the service was great."}
{"text":"We really like FW.  It is a must go spot when we have out of town guests.   Especially like the half and half sandwich and salad/soup options.  Have never had a negative experience!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I was pretty hungry with no high hopes for lunch.  I checked the nearby restaurants on Yelp, of course.  First Watch popped up first and it took about 10 seconds for me to see that this was worth a shot. They were still open so I popped in the directions.  Three minutes later, I was there. The hostess told me it was a 15 minute wait but offered the \"bar\" seating.  This was a table that sat 10 people.  I sat and waited a few minutes while perusing the menu.  I was excited to be there.  When the waitress arrived, I ordered water and the Chicken Chimichurri Hash.  This was a limited time special and it quickly caught my eye.  The ingredients were two cage-free eggs (had to be over medium), atop fresh, seasoned potatoes tossed in Chimichurri sauce with all-natural chicken breast, Monterey Jack, house-roasted onions and kale.  The dish was served with whole grain artisan toast with all-natural preserves and fresh fruit.  Let me tell you, my eggs were perfect and my bar mate, Angela, and I had the same dish so we discussed it while we ate.  It was heavenly!  The bread was fresh and delicious. The preserves were mouth watering and the fruit, well, it was freshly prepared and simply divine.  I was elated to be in this restaurant to experience freshly prepared food.  The taste of farm-to-table quickly grabbed me in and I will jump at the opportunity to visit this restaurant again. I already know what I am going to order, unless they have another limited time special that trumps it. Can we please get one North of Charlotte?"}
{"text":"Doing this review in real time!   The Service: So far, greeted by some very friendly folks and tons of smiles. Talkative and seem genuinely interested in getting to know us, while still keeping the momentum of the ordering and service moving forward at a nice pace.  The Food: Coffee, good, simple brew. They leave a pot on the table for refills - I love restaurants that do that!  I ordered the A.M. Super Food Bowl: coconut pudding, chia seeds, homemade granola and berries. I know, healthy stuff, but this was good!! So many textures and good but not overpowering coconut flavor. And comes with a side of whole grain toast with almond butter - I would highly recommend!  Daughter ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon - YUM!! The flavors were all there but the smoked salmon definitely takes over the rest. But what do you expect from smoked anything! Comes with side of spring salad and tomatoes. Overall tasty.  Wife got the Elevated Egg Sandwich - on the waitresses recommendation so I hope it's good! Delicious! With gooey yolk dripping out and delicious bacon and fantastic brioche bread! A side of charred home fries rounds it off!  Little guy got the chocolate chip pancakes - hard to screw that up :)  Price: About mid for price. No more than you'd spend at IHOP - and the atmosphere and food are better!  Atmosphere: Very nice. Wood panel and tin walls, with beams across the ceiling and rustic fixtures throughout. Enough lighting coming in to be bright and the staff is so friendly.   Overall, I dig this place very much! Nice place to take the family!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place in Maryland but finally got to try it in Arizona when visiting and I am so glad I did.  The food was amazing and the customer service was friendly and our food order did not take long.  They do not skimp on the servings and make fresh juices which is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the location is comforting and cozy. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"No food runners and no heat lamps in the kitchen. While our food was flavorful, it was cold. A huge bummer!"}
{"text":"I preferred this place before it was bought out by a healthy chain. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for healthy, but the food just wasn't that great -- it tasted bad, like they didn't clean the pan before they cooked my eggs -- and the portions were tiny. The décor is kind of pretentious and overly stylized and the chairs weren't even comfortable. Miss the old First Watch a lot!"}
{"text":"Great food, interesting selections on the menu, good service. We left feeling well fed on reasonably healthy food but not over stuffed. We came here twice during our visit to Phoenix and would definitely come again. We loved the avocado toast!"}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed by this location. The service was mediocre at best and the food didn't have a lot of flavor. Our waters were empty most the meal and my bacon was pretty burnt to the point where it left a horrible taste in my mouth. When we brought up the burnt bacon to the waitress she said well at least all of it isn't burnt...... I wish I was kidding. Their other locations have been pretty decent. The restaurant wasn't even busy the day we went."}
{"text":"So we sat on the patio, asked for five minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. After 20+ minutes we just left. I'm done with first watch. Seriously garbage service."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning. I did not know it was no longer good egg. I was greatly disappointed. We ordered the roast beef hash, cinnamon chip pancakes breakfast and the chimichicken. The chimichicken thing was still cold and their were onions in it that were raw. Which would have been fine but they should have been cooked and the person who ordered it is allergic to raw onions. The pancakes we soggy, and two eggs must have come from a baby chick because they were super small and also cold.   We should have just done Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great staff that is super friendly and welcoming. The menu is nice with many different options. The cost is a bit high for Downtown Tempe Mill Ave, but not too outrageous or anymore than some of the other places to eat. Great atmosphere with comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love finding little gems like this place when I travel! Had the kale juice and cherry chicken quinoa bowl. Delish!"}
{"text":"Great app, amazing food and I can't rave enough about the amazing service.  What a great find!"}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon, because we received a BOGO entree mailer. I had been to a different location once before and it was good so I thought we would give this one a try since it was new to the area.   We were greeted by a gentleman who politely took my name and number down and stated that it would be approximately a 5-10 min wait. We got a text saying out table was ready and was seated shortly after. We immediately noticed the time and money it took them to make the restaurant look the way it did- a modern, farm-house dining room instantly came to mind. Every detail was a nice touch to the experience of dining in.   Although we waited longer than we anticipated for our food to be served to us, it was worth the few extra minutes it took the kitchen to prepare it. My brunch choice (AM Super food bowl) came recommended from a Yelp reviewer so I decided to give it a try. I also ordered a side of Millionare's Bacon because well, why not? My boyfriend ordered the Tri-fecta.   Everything tasted divine. The bacon was peppered to perfection with a drizzle of maple syrup; the toast served with my bowl was thick and slathered in almond butter. The pudding accompanied with the various fruit and granola toppings was something my palette thoroughly enjoyed. What we thought was a triple berry jam on his Tri-fecta is something worth tasting- some of the best I've ever had.   The Carrot, Ginger Chai is a seasonal drink that was absolutely delicious. If you have the chance to try it you will not be disappointed.   Will we be back? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time the other day.  Our waiter was super helpful going over the menu in great detail.   My wife and I both decided to order the TriFecta - eggs, Belgium waffle, and 4 pieces of bacon.   Probably the best breakfast I have ever eaten.  The only complaint is that I wanted to try everything on the menu.  Highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back.  The decor inside is very homey and friendly as well.    Also, try the Morning Motivation fresh juiced drink as an added bonus!"}
{"text":"We ate at this location for the first time yesterday and it was fantastic. It is such a refreshing concept!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the food, but the restaurant itself.   After checking the wait on Nowait, it said \"come on in\".  So we made the drive the the restaurant only to find that the wait was 45 minutes.  I understand perfectly that popular restaurants have waits st busy times, and the last thing they are thinking about is updating their line status on Nowait.  However, if you are going to advertise that you use the Nowait app, then you have to update your status.  I showed them their status just before we left for a different restaurant and by the time we got to the car they had changed it.  I might give the place another try, but I'll call first even if Nowait says no line."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The décor is both fun and inviting.  We've had great service since the switch from Good Egg (We've always had wonderful servers here no matter what the name!).  It took the best from both of these great breakfast/lunch places and combined them.  My absolute favorite is the avocado toast!  Recently I broke the \"trend\" and had the chia pudding power bowl and it was so fresh and delicious with so many great textures!  My husband loves the breakfast burritos too.  The management also listens to our suggestions and takes care of the very few problems we've had."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times and we always love the service and healthy choices.  My favorite this past year has been the addition of their avocado toast and eggs.  As per the norm-they make mine w/ egg whites w/o butter and the whole grain toast is as delicious as it is hearty.  Love the way they prepare the avocado w/ lemon, sea salt and olive oil-delectable"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  The Good Egg and their sister restaurant The Eggery were always great places to go. This location was recently rebranded as a First Watch. I've never been overly impressed with them but the new decor is nice. The service and execution are sub standard. The food wasn't great. My wife's oatmeal was clearly from a packet and my eggs were nothing to write home about. Our three kids each got kids meals. They used to bring a water pitcher out when you were seated. I didn't even pay attention until my daughter asked if she could have some water after our food arrived. We flagged down our server and she got us some water. It felt a little bit strange that we had to ask but ok. Finish up out blah meal and my wife notices on the menu that the kids meals come with a drink. My wife flags down the server and asks about it. Her response \"you get a drink if you ask for it.\"  Really. You don't offer a drink? Response. \"Nope.\"  The server then says well what do they want?  Breakfast is over and I don't think I should have to argue about getting what's included in a meal. Get up to pay and the manager takes the check and my wife questions her. Same response. I handed her my credit card but I told her that I wasn't comfortable paying for drinks we didn't get. She says that she has no clue how to even take that off the bill. Great I'll pay for it but that's the last penny First Watch will ever get out of me. In all fairness my wife followed up with the regional manager and she offered us a free meal but we aren't interested in going back. One interesting note is that the First Watch philosophy is not to ask too many questions. They might want want to amend that so their customers can understand what is included in a meal."}
{"text":"The food was terrible, cold and not properly cooked. My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and its hard to screw up but they certainly did.   Wouldn't go back there if they paid me.  I have been to several First Watch restaurants in fact the one close to my home in Fort Myers is one of my favorites.  They need to improve their quality control."}
{"text":"On weekends there are long waits.  This is due only because they are understaffed, so the service was slow and the food is not worth the wait.  Skip this one!"}
{"text":"I went to First Watch when visiting Arizona and went for breakfast. The food was really good and their fresh juices were delicious. I would definitely go there again when I visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love that they have so many menu items with avocado - my favorite! I tried breakfast and lunch items and was happy with everything I ate there so far. The Baja turkey burger is juicy and delicious. The soups and the omelets are great! My husband isn't the biggest fan cause the menu is pretty limited and the choices are healthy, which means no big burgers and such. So probably not the right place for everyone. But I love it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Good food, great service and a very friendly and chill environment."}
{"text":"I had no idea Good Egg was transitioning into First Watch! Very smooth transition! Beautifully renovated. Delicious food and lots of healthy options. Immediately seated. Friendly staff. Prompt delivery of food to the table. Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are amazing. BLTE with potatoes were delish! Super stoked to have First Watch in the Ocotillo area. Highly impressed for my first visit. Will def return. THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"Fantastic was my first time there. It is my Moms 70th birthday and today was special for obvious reasons, I ordered the breakfast tacos...Wow amazing. My mom ordered the Avocado Toast she ate almost the whole meal and thats great having Cancer she was able to enjoy everything including the coffee!!!! Fantastic Service Fantastic Food We Will Be Back.....Thanks for making the day a bit more special!!!!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation for 10 days and found this place, food is amazing, portions are great and they are made like you are at home.  We tried 6-7 different things on the menu and they were just great"}
{"text":"Server was Maddy and she was great. I had the pumpkin pancakes; so good. Next day we went back and I had the chorizo green chili omelet.  This was served with their artisan whole grain toast.  This bread was filled with nuts and seeds; just great."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. The environment is friendly and the service is always good.  When going in for breakfast though the prices seem quite a bit high. A side of bacon (4 pieces) is $4.29, a cup of coffee is almost 3 dollars.  I really do enjoy the food (avocado toast and chickichanga specifically), but simply can't swallow some the prices. Not sure if this is a recent change but it was a subject of conversation with my group the last 2 times I was here."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Sat down the hostess brought me coffee two tables brought in after me both brought their drinks and asked for food and no one ever came to my table... I will never go here again!!! It was my first time"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see this place tucked into the corner of all the bright shiny new places in McCandless. I'd never been to one of these before, knowing it's a chain, so I was looking forward to trying it out.  I love a good hash. Something about all the breakfast incidents all mixed into one bowl does the job for me, so I ordered the farm stand hash. The hash was good, but needed more flavor, so I threw on a dash of salt and pepper. I did like how crispy the bacon was, so extra points for that.   I also got greedy and ordered a side of carrot cake pancakes. Now carrot cake is one of my all time faves, so I was super excited about it. It was a let down though. Didn't really taste like anything to be honest, least of all carrot cake. I keep thinking about the side of bread I got with the hash though. Do they make it in house? Or buy it locally? It was some sort of thick cut grain bread and it was fabulous!   Their menu is huge, so I'd be down to try lunch at some point too, especially if it included that delicious bread again!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from here and it's always our go-to! I always get the elevated egg sandwich. But today I decided to get something new and tried the chickichanga, it was delicious. And one of their new seasonal juices a carrot ginger chai. It was fabulous. Plus good, fast service"}
{"text":"Worth Noting:  Breakfast, Brunch, and lunch only - but tons of great options. Closes at 2:30.   Atmosphere: Rustic Vibe.  Good lighting.  Porch with a garage door that seems that it will open in warm weather.  There were many different sized tables to accommodate many party types.  Cozy.  I noticed a ton of electrical outlets, so if you plan on doing work at this place  Ease of Entry:  They utilize NoWait, but there was literally...no wait.  I think it was because of today being Parade Day and people were in the city.  The parking lot is very small, so even though there were many open tables, there were only two available parking spots.    Service: As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two different staff, one of which seemed to be the manager.  We were seated right away, food came quickly.  The waitress was attentive.  We were checked-in on by at least two other staff.  I couldn't have asked for better service at a brunch restaurant.   Food: My wife chose the Floridian French Toast.  It was a very thick brioche with wheat germ (which always throw me off...why the hell would they name it that...who every \"they\" is...I assume ties to a shortened version of germination but let's get creative...haha) and powdered cinnamon sugar - topped with strawberries, bananas, and kiwi.  It was very well prepared and presented.  The flavors and textures were perfect, as expected.  I had the Chickichanga.  I was pretty excited because I've never had breakfast style chimichanga.  It consisted of eggs, chicken, chorizo, chilies, Cheddar and Monterey Jack, onions and avocado...wrapped up in a tortilla.  It was topped with some sort of delicious sauce and sour cream.  It came with a fruit cup and seasoned potatoes.  The potatoes themselves was worth it.  I'm not going to try to describe the taste of the chickichanga, but it is definitely worth getting.    Drink: Water served in a glass milk jug.  I ordered a fresh juice - Kale Tonic - very tasty.  There were two other juices and had a very hard time choosing what to go with, but I was very satisfied with this.   Value: Our total meal came to around $25.  It was a great deal for the quality of the food, service and overall experience.    Summary: We will be returning again.  I don't know how frequently due to the limited hours and we rarely go for lunch or breakfast on the weekends.  I could see this place having issues down the road with accessibility, due to the limited parking and being on busy Route 51.  I will have a hard time choosing something over the chickichanga.  I am glad that we have an option in the south hills that isn't a national chain - and I don't feel like dogshit after eating."}
{"text":"Just ok. Food was creative but not executed well. Waitstaff was to busy to clear tables and there was birds everywhere eating leftovers on plates outside."}
{"text":"We had brunch here today and it was perfect. Everything is fresh, if there is an issue it is resolved, without fuss. I've enjoyed meals with two servers: Marisa and Adam, who are both spectacular. It's my observation, that the whole staff is equally well trained. I will return again and again."}
{"text":"Loved the Good Egg and have given First Watch a chance but just can't figure out why they changed a great place with good food. I have found their food tasteless. Had the classic Eggs Benedict this morning and it had no taste whatsoever. The potatoes were not cooked and the only taste they had was of the overpowering onions. The water doesn't even come with ice.  Given another chance since it is so convenient to my location but won't waste my time or money again!"}
{"text":"Ummmm yep! Fig Prosciutto with two over easy eggs! - ok name how many places you can get this combo?  The Fig Prosciutto had a hearty fig spread that has a seedy texture, every bite had that sweet and salty taste too it, which is a HUGE plus.  The over easy eggs looked like they came out of a pictorial of breakfast books. They were perfectly made.  This place is right after you exit the highway and it's a quick and easy spot to find - the servers are wonderful as is the service.  Enjoyed every minute of this spot."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and courteous. They have many different choices on benny's which is what got me hooked in the first place. I would highly recommend getting a smoothy it's a nice refreshing way to start you day. Morning Meditation is my personal favorite is the BLT benny however you won't be let down with any food there."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  I loved how they let me put myself on the waitlist before we had arrived in person. So nice. Food and service was top notch. I got the Farm Stand breakfast tacos. Yum."}
{"text":"Expecting to have a delicious Sunday breakfast with my  family ended up being very disappointing and somewhat disgusting. Walked in at about 1:50pm and Lady/hostess that was standing at door was not very inviting. She did not smile or even acknowledge me or my 3 year old grandson as we walked in till The rest of family members walked in. The table we sat at had crumbs on the benches not little crumbs but big ones. Another thing we noticed was the staff started cleaning (sweeping n mopping)around us and kitchen area while we were there because they were closing in half an hour. Waitress was nice and attentive however forgot my grandsons apple juice which came with his meal. The disgusting part was at the end of our meal...we noticed a HAIR in my grandsons French toast!! Notified manager and she took his meal off our bill. We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Great but busy place for breakfast. Love that they have a seasonal menu. Unlimited coffee is nice. Service is average, I've had both good and bad wait staff. Nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast/brunch/lunch restaurant. I can always find something delicious to eat here!"}
{"text":"MMM, delicious bacon!  I found the one in St. Louis area more enchanting, but this is one chain that is spreading."}
{"text":"Came here for a business breakfast. Nice, open environment with fast, friendly service. I ordered the Farmhouse Skillet and it was delicious. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but will definitely stop in if in the area and would have other business meetings here."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at First Watch. Great selection of items and all very fresh and loaded with flavor. My family all goes all the time. Avocado Toast is a favorite as are the breakfast tacos I had today. The Benedicts the Hashes... dig in an enjoy. Lunches are great too. Nothing bad to say about this incredible breakfast, brunch and lunch spot! Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place to come to after our morning walk. The menu has an array of tasty items, including many healthy options. The staff are always very friendly and efficient. They really work their butts off and go above and beyond to make our experience pleasant. One this day we had Ellen who's an absolute rockstar. I inquired about one of their tonics and she was nice enough to bring a sample of each one! I feel welcomed as soon as I open the door. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast! They have really good seasonal dishes. Many healthy choices, friendly staff, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent combo of cheesy grits, pork belly bacon and eggs! The citrus salad on the side added a welcomed balance to the savory meal. Had to wait 15 minutes on a busy Black Friday ....not too bad."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food! Long waits, but if you get there by 8am you can usually be seated right away. I recommend everything on the menu, lol, but I'm especially fine of the triathlete omelette, and The market hash skillet is amazing too!!!! This place is well worth the wait yummm"}
{"text":"I absolutely Love First Watch! The Morning Meditation juice is my favorite - orange, lemon, ginger, tumeric and beet juice is so refreshing! On this particular day I also had hot tea - which was nice to get a selection brought to the table. The classic was perfect with the eggs, bacon, toast - I could have done with out so many potatoes but it was still perfect and delicious. Charismatic server also. Great spot!"}
{"text":"First time in a long time that a meal served at a restaurant was perfect in presentation, temperature and taste! Thank you FirstWatch!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious and their BLT Eggs Benedict was absolutely amazing. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Liked the fact that we could put our name in on a wait list using my iPhone on a busy Sunday morning.  As a result, we didn't have to wait very long even though there were lots of other people waiting to get in the restaurant.  The food was decent--but their biscuits and gravy breakfast was not the version I was used to from the Midwest.  Staff was attentive and pleasant.   Would go back another time but order something different."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is horrible! The app said wait time was 20-30 minutes, we waited for 45 minutes. To top it of the hostess said we were up next, but then proceeded to sit 2 different parties before sitting us. When we finally get a table the coffee mugs are DIRTY! Coffee stains and she just pours the coffee in as if they were ready to be used. Poor follow up, asking if we needed anything or if we wanted anything additional simply brought the check. The only reason I bring it up is because they'd ask other tables if there was anything else they needed. Worst experience I've had in a really long time. Oh and they charge tax 3x, each person is a seat and gets taxed and then the overall tax... this was a place recommended by a friend but maybe the one downtown is better, the one in Arrowhead is horrible!"}
{"text":"First Watch is, I imagine, what Panera used to feel like, before it become just another fast food place. The decor feels cozy and intimate, even though a large community table can seat about a dozen people. It also boasts freshly made food, ingredients straight from a farm, made in their kitchen (not sure how much I believe that claim though).  The service has always been adequate and friendly. My only gripe with First Watch is their lack of allergen-options (seriously - what year is it now - EVERYONE has an allergen friendly menu). Though I am grateful for the fresh juice options, there are not many options for vegans without having to play some serious dietary menu-scrabble. I get sad when a big group wants to go here, because I know it's a Juice and Coffee for me, while everyone else gets a hearty meal.  Overall - I know that most \"breakfast\" places won't be vegan friendly, since eggs, cheese and baby piglets are the \"centerpieces\" for Americans eating breakfast. But a non-dairy butter option, like Earth Balance or Olivio, would be nice. I could at least order some toast then!"}
{"text":"I saw a commercial for this breakfast place. I go there frequently with out of town guests and friends. The food is amazing, fresh, plated nicely and healthy but tasty.  I love the Avocado toast with basted eggs. I scrape off the avocado and eat it separately and dip my toast into the eggs. The toast is thick and really good. Waitresses are a bit slow and don't check back enough. The coffee is very weak and a bit of a disappointment.  The food is worth waiting for, and the Morning meditation juice is so good."}
{"text":"My friend and I knew we wanted to try First Watch when another reviewed mentioned their disappointment with all the egg white and turkey options on the menu.  \"That's our kind of place!\" we determined.  Both of us are 55 year old women, loving breakfast but watching calories, needing protein but leery of fat.  Not by choice but necessity, mind you.  First Watch is now OUR PLACE!  During a week long visit to Scottsdale, we found it on Day 3 and ate there three times.  While everything we ordered from the Healthy Option menu was well-prepared and delicious, we both fell in love with the Avocado Toast.  We opted to ditch calories for healthy fats and it was worth it.  Totally amazing - not guac but just pure avocado with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon.  The attitude of all of our servers were warm, friendly, helpful, and attentive.  I am now a committed First Watch fan and even though there are no restaurants in CO where I live, I am looking for them wherever my upcoming travels take me.  Like Jacksonville next week - woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Saturday mornings are for mimosas and brunch. Too bad this place does not serve mimosas!  We came to First Watch after receiving a coupon in the mail for. BOGO free special. Since I got up early on a Saturday and we had nothing else going on, we stopped in for some juice and for some eats. I had good the Root Down (a mixture of beets, ginger, and other stuff) and the BLT Eggs Benedict. My juice was gingery goodness that woke me right up! All signs of drowsiness was gone. As for eggs benedict, they were okay. The eggs were overcooked and didn't ooze and delicious yolk when cutting in half. It failed that test completely. The hollandaise also wasn't as lemony or creamy as I prefer but I did enjoy all the fresh greens on the plate. They were both served on a piece of toasted buttery bread instead if the traditional muffin which I enjoyed since it gave it some texture. Bacon was cooked perfectly and I was satisfied.  All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in again but they definitely need work on the eggs benedict. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"When I was younger I thought First Watch was a local restaurant that started at this location because they had several menu items with hospital \"themed\" names and with some of my family working at the hospital, it seemed like it must have been created just for them.  I was dashed to find out it wasn't true.  This is still my favorite First Watch location, and I thnk should be listed somewhere as \"Best place to choke on your ham\" or \"Best place to meet a single Dr.\"  or something because it's littered with hospital staff.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...  I love everything on the menu.  I love how fresh everything tastes and how healty it (almost) all seems.  I didn't realize the limits of the menu until I went there for breakfast with someone who doens't eat eggs.  Wow. There goes 90% of the menu.  Not that a breakfast/lunch place has to have tons of non-egg options, but if someone is looking for an alternative, it's pretty much just pancakes, or order something from the lunch menu.    Service has always been good, though rushed at times.  Wonder if any of these folks are just working here to meet the Dr's of their mother's dreams?  Could be interesting to find out..."}
{"text":"The test of a breakfast place is how they cook over medium eggs. In my experience, three out of five places get it wrong and undercook them. Unfortunately, this place also got it wrong. They cooked over medium eggs like over easy eggs. Cooks take note: if the white of the eggs is still runny, it's not over medium, it's over easy. And gross!   I don't know if the cooks don't know how to properly prepare an over medium egg or if they're just in too much of a hurry to do it right. What is interesting is that I've found that the independent, little diners tend to get it right more often that the chains.   But the bacon and toast was excellent. The home fries were only so-so (dried out and over cooked). The coffee is also excellent, though a little high priced. And it would be much better if they served real half and half with the coffee instead of those little individual creamers."}
{"text":"Had it for the first time today and it was delicious! Highly recommend trying the chickichanga! Has chicken and choizo inside which was an awesome combo! I also had the wheat toast with a very generous amount of avocado on top! (I love avocado) and to top it off they have cholula hot sauce!! A big plus for me because I hate Tabasco hot sauce!! Thank you Mary for serving me today! The staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here after a night shift for a relaxed brunch.  The food stands up decently against similar breakfast spots across town.  My husband and I split the BLT eggs benedict and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Both were tasty.  Portion sizes were slightly smaller than standard fat American brunch joint, which could potentially be disappointing if you're a standard fat American but likely is healthier for all of us.  Service was unfortunately less than ideal the morning we visited.  Not sure whether we were just there on an off-day, but the staff felt rushed and was less-than-inclined to offer tips about the menu"}
{"text":"Went to the McCandless Crossing location on Sunday for breakfast. Very nice addition to the North Hills. This is my first time ever at a First Watch. Never even heard of it before. The new restaurant is open and the decor welcoming. We had to wait about a half hour for a table, but the hostess and everyone were very nice. It being my first time I wasn't prepared to order, but on someone's advice I ordered the Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl. What is Quinoa? I had no idea at the time and still really don't, but it doesn't have much flavor. I had to dump some hot sauce on it to spice it up. My brother eats healthier than myself really likes the Pesto Chicken Power Bowl. I'll definitely return and try to be more prepared."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for breakfast, brunch, and lunch! The menu has a variety of options ranging from classic toast to omelets. The food tastes and looks very fresh made on the day of. The serving size is also very satisfactory. I've been here several times and food stays consistent which is always appreciated in an eatery.  Side note, the cups they serve, at the chandler location, is due to the restaurant's use of hard water not soft. They dishes are not dirty!!"}
{"text":"Great menu options with health conscious choices. Reminds me of places I would eat when I lived in Chicago. Italian wedding soup was unique (a little thick) and delicious. Potatoes were delicious and seasoned well. Chicken protein bowl was awesome as well (not too much sauce). Great service as well and nice atmosphere (crowded in a good way). I look forward to going back often."}
{"text":"This place is just fine.  You will have a decent breakfast.  Their coffee is great, they have lots of different flavored creamers and the food is fine.  We got tired of paying $20 for breakfast at the big named hotels across the street.  We tried this place out and never ate at the hotels again, even if the boss was paying.  Certainly worth a trip if you're stuck in downtown for a few days."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere.The food options leaned toward the health conscious, but there were definitely tempting decadent options. We had breakfast here and loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is absolutely amazing. We have been coming here for about 4 years and it's one of my favs. The food is always fresh. Their fruit actually tastes like what the fruit is. Like its not sitting on the back all mixed together in some fruit cup or something. I have tried almost the whole menu and have never been disappointed.  Even our friends from out of town ask us to take them here again and again. I have been to a couple other locations and this one is by far my favorite. Just one thing...I have to praise the staff again. Everyone is so friendly and happy. EVERYRIME! They always remember us and ask how we're doing. You girls are awesome!!! Coffee is the best also! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our waitress only greeted us and took our order, past this the only way we were able to receive service was to flag her down repeatedly after her looking at us and walking by. The food we ordered was undercooked and not evem how we ordered it..... Most definately will not be returning..... This location should've remained \"The Good Egg,\" at least then the food was good and customer service was provided. McDonald's would've been better!"}
{"text":"First Watch is one of our weekend go-tos for brunch. I can get breakfast, while the hubby can choose lunch if he wants. They have something for everyone - huge pancakes, skillets, crepe wraps, etc. It's always delicious and not too expensive. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service and yummy food. I like just about any of their breakfast or brunch entrees, especially the skillets, crepe eggs, and wraps. Home style potatoes and fruit on the side are a plus. I always think about trying lunch items, but end up going with breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Nice classy atmosphere, they also use \"No Wait\" which makes the customer experience way better. The place is very clean, also they give you a full pot of coffee to keep at your table which is very convenient if you drink a lot of coffee. The menu is interesting, gives a healthy twist yet still giving you a good tasting breakfast. The food is prepared very well and it looks amazing when brought out to you. The food is very good, everything was cooked very well and the workers are very friendly. It's also nice that they tell you via their website how to order a healthier meal if you're watching your calories."}
{"text":"Oh man, I really wanted to like this place. So badly did I want to like this place that I went here on my birthday with my whole family. But really what ended up happening was that we spent a hefty chunk of change for breakfast and we were all disappointed.  The first thing I'll say is that the service is not great. Not bad, but not great. It was very hard to get our waitresses attention and there were at least two rounds of empty coffee cups that weren't filled for more then five minutes. This place brings you a carafe but the thing was empty in 30 seconds the first time, and then the next two replacements were lukewarm to cold (which we sent back and it took more then 10 minutes to get a replacement on the last one). Totally unacceptable for a breakfast place.   Also, in regards to the service, the waitress seemed very green. Not only did she not know the menu (at all) but this also might have been her first waitress job because her timing was totally off and she only checked on us twice (over an hour and a half). ALL of our coffee refills were done through the next sections waiter because we could never find her.   But that to me is not the worst part. The worst part was that all four of us ordered four different dishes and the salt level in every single one was astronomical. My father didn't eat half his meal (which was never commented on by the waitstaff) and my mother only ate a 1/4 of hers (also not commented on), I ate more then half of mine and my Grandpa ate his whole thing (because he can't taste much anymore). But I tried everyone's dish and my mother's in particular was so salty that I drank nearly a half cup of coffee just to wash the taste out of my mouth.   I don't know who is responsible in the kitchen for that mess but it was atrocious. There is absolutely no way that someone could not notice how much salt was being put on those dishes. Which to me means that no one in the kitchen is tasting what they make, and no one is experienced enough to season dishes properly. With only one dish being messed up a person could say it's an accident. But all four? That speaks to a systematic issue.  Please, management of this establishment, fix your salt issue! It's disgusting!"}
{"text":"Great for novel, lean eating options.  Definitely going to make this my lunchtime dining choice when I want to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning. We had to wait a while to be seated. They seemed to only have 1 person ringing people out and seating people. It was pretty busy and there is a lot of places to sit. Very laid back. Kind of the place you would go on a morning after drinking or a late night! We parked across the street in the big lot. Parking is free downtown on the weekends. The waitress was very polite and friendly although she seemed eager to move us on our way. Their menu is amazing! I loved almost anything they had listed and they had some unique creations and a lighter menu too. I had a traditional breakfast and my friend had an omelette and both were good and fresh and big portions that we couldn't finish. Bathrooms were nice and clean. The manager made small talk with everyone while he rang them up. Overall, good experience and I would love to go back and try some more off their menu!"}
{"text":"The place was clean, quiet and the waitress and staff were very cordial and gracious. The fruit crepe listed in the \"healthy\" section however was just about the worst thing we ever ate. The  crepe part was ice cold and tasteless (like cardboard maybe?) and the so-called  \"freshly baked\" muffin was also ice cold and as hard as a rock. The two items tasted like they rolled-off an assembly line in anotbher state one month or so ago. Based on other reviews, which are largely positive, I can only surmise that we ordered the wrong dish. But have to ask how do you screw-up a fruit crepe so badly? I don't like giving poor reviews but if only one person can be spared from ever having to suffer through eating that fruit crepe my work will be done."}
{"text":"We received a BOGO entree so decided to use it.  It was very crowded so had to wait about 30 minutes.  We were seated in a booth, which was nice.  The food was really good.  My husband told the server that the potatoes were over salted so he could not eat them.  My meal was tasty, but the scrambled eggs were cold.  All in all, it was a decent breakfast and we will return."}
{"text":"If there is a wait... it is worth it!!!!!! Their seasonal menu never disappoints and always keeps things interested! It's an amazing breakfast spot with all the traditional food done correctly and all their combinations thought out perfectly !!! If you are trying to be on the lighter side their options are still amazingly delicious !!! Their pancakes are huge and delicious, their avocado toast is always amazing ! CANT GO WRONG WITH ANYTHING ON THE MENU!"}
{"text":"Been here two days in a row, once for breakfast, and once for lunch. The good is absolutely delicious and fresh. Love this place."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch after church and was pleasantly surprised!    We had a group of about 12 people.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table, but once we got one service was attentive and quick.  After I placed my order, the food was there in less than 5 minutes.  No clue how they did that.  I had the quinoa pancakes, which were a special that day.  They were served with house-made granola and a lemon syrup of some kind.  They were fantastic.  A lot of people in our group got the Chicichanga and loved it.   Only complaint is that the food for the table came out very staggered.  The first people got their food about 10 minutes before the last people, which can make for an uncomfortable experience, especially if you're trying to be courteous and wait for the last plate to arrive before starting to eat.  Overall a good brunch spot, especially for having more than one location (which usually makes me skeptical)."}
{"text":"Great decor, friendly staff and AMAZINGLY fresh and tasty food! Had the green juice, morning meditation, Floridian French Toast, Avocado Toast and the Morning Power Bowl which were all exceptional. Be sure to stop by if you're in town. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The carrot cake pancakes are so good. I love this place because it is healthy and fast."}
{"text":"Place was great, not at all what expected.  Starting with the fresh juices, all the way to the millionaire bacon!  Good food!"}
{"text":"After two visits, we've given up on this place. Voted best! Don't think so.   The makeover from the old Good Egg is welcome and service is good but that's it. In a word, they need a totally new plan for the kitchen.   Your food, some of it or mostly likely all of it, will arrive cold. Toast will be cold and limp. Waffles will be cold and limp. Hey guys, if you want to prep these in mass quantities, fine. Just put them back in a toaster or waffle iron for a minute before you bring them out. Stuff won't even melt butter in summer.   Ordered cheese grits and they came out half cooked. Hard centers. Sent them back and they did take them off the bill. Oh, and they were yellow but I don't know what from - couldn't taste any cheese.   Most of the problem is the way food is served. They arrange everything spread out on a large ceramic plate. Very stylish but the plates aren't warmed and they are a huge heat sink that just sucks all the life out of your meal.   For the price,  definitely not it worth it. They could even lower their prices and we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Yes! I finally have a first watch that doesn't take me an hour to get to!!! Food is awesome as always and coupled with great service at this new location.   Please get a sign to be seen by the road. I found this location accidentally by coming in the parking lot to turn around.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"I found this place accidentally a few years ago while waiting for the Nissan deanship to fix my car. I thought it was a blood drawing lab from afar but figured out it was a breakfast place as I got closer. I was actually hungry so I stopped in and was greeted with awesome service. I asked the waiter for a recommendation and he told me to get the \"Burrito Vera Cruz\". I was hooked from there.  I went home and told my wife about this awesome breakfast place up in Scottsdale....(an hour drive for us) and it has since become our favorite place for an amazing breakfast.  We find ourselves making excuses to drive up to Scottsdale just so we can go to First Watch for breakfast. The prices are totally reasonable, the portions are just right, the restaurant itself is beautiful and the staff are friendly and upbeat.   Whats weird though is that we went to a First Watch in Phoenix and were totally disappointed. This location and the one along I-17 are incredible.   Please build one closer to Casa Grande....PLEASE."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food was great, especially the bread and egga.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"absolutely tremendous staff and food. you can switch, and substitute food and it's all absolutely delicious and fairly priced and filling. it's great."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!! Healthy options that were still very tasty!! Loved the morning motivation juice!! The breakfast sandwich was amazing!!! The Parma Hash did not disappoint either!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They just switched this restaurant over from a Good Egg to First Watch which I think happened within the past couple weeks. They do not have their new setup organized very well yet. They told me my wait time would be 10-15 minutes and it ended up being 30 minutes. There was 3 tables unseated the whole time I was waiting so I just figured they were short staffed so they couldn't sit those tables. To my disappointment, 30 minutes later they sat me at one of those empty tables. Weak.  The \"multi-grain\" pancake I ordered to start was cold, didn't even melt the butter I put on it and didn't really seem multi-grain. The waitress wasn't very pleasant from the beginning and I could tell she was stressed from the kitchen so I'll give her a pass. My eggs Benedict came out completely wrong so I had to send it back and they came back with the right one quickly....kind of. I think they reused what they could from the wrong plate and moved it to a new one. The eggs were overdone, there was the wrong meat mixed in with the right meat and it wasn't very hot. The hollandaise had good flavor and it does seem like they use fresh ingredients but overall just below average breakfast.  I might give this place another try in a couple months after they've hopefully worked these kinks out. For now, I don't even know why I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times & would go over lgoNo!, kneader's etc. pkg better than lgoNo! in am."}
{"text":"Great new healthy eatery in town. Great vibe and wide variety on menu. Service people are very friendly and helpful. Looking for a new experience and healthy choices? Then First Watch is for you. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"So a friend and myself decided to eat brunch here on fathers day since her dad wasn't in town and my dad wanted to be a couch potato and do nothing. Crazy right? As usual all of my friends generally depend on me to find somewhere new and exciting to go eat so I had been seeing First watch post on Instagram and decided to give them a trial run. My thoughts was this better be good because its almost a 30 minute drive from my house because I live in Steele Creek area and First Watch was on the other side of town darn near pretty much in Matthews. We both were happy, the service was great, we sat outside due to the long wait in the inside so I didn't get any pics inside but it was a real country feel in the there. I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes that were oh so tasty, the million dollar bacon which was saturated in a maple type syrup of some sort ,and topped it all off with the kale tonic and my friend tried the hibiscus limeade. If they move a location to the Steele creek area I will definitely go back .     and watch tv and didn't want to go anywhere we went out on their day."}
{"text":"There's a reason Butters & Snooze have long waits & this place does not. The food is just fine, but not long-wait-worthy. Also, it seems odd that they don't offer any gluten-free pancake or bread options since they're all about offering local, organic (healthy) food."}
{"text":"I wish my rating was based on their food & service.   Instead, it's based on the fact that we were never even seated. We went for brunch and were told it'd be an hour wait (which is understandable considering it was Father's Day, so no worries).  We gave our phone number and they said they'd send us a text when our table was ready (again, should have been an hour wait). After waiting for over an hour and a half, we left because we still hadn't been called in to be seated. Even after we left, we still never received a text. I understand if you're busy but you can't make people wait for no reason and waste their time. Obviously this isn't indicative of everyone's experience at First Watch, but it's a shame something like this happens to anyone."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum! The only problem is what to order. I typically order the same one of two things at restaurants but can't find a \"go to\" dish at First Watch due to everything being fresh and flavorful. I enjoy how I never feel rushed to visit a friend during off hours and that they put the water pitcher and coffee carafe on the table, so there is plenty. My only wish is they would open earlier."}
{"text":"Lunch. I have been here twice for lunch.  Just had lunch there today and ordered the veggie burger which comes with red onion, tomato, and a basic guacamole on top plus a side salad or bowl of soup. I got the tomato basil soup. The veggie burger was really good and very filling. It was piled high with greens (not lettuce) and guacamole and I had to cut it in half (which is a good thing). The soup was great too. came with 2 packets of crackers (2 crackers each). As someone who normally doesn't like tomato soup I was impressed. I'm sure there is some cream (maybe sour cream) also mixed it. It had a good balance of tomato and basil flavor.   The first time I was there I ordered more of a brunch and the sausage was very good and I enjoyed my meal, but, I remember wishing there was more food. I know, that's partly on me for my order and it being my first time there. This meal was several months ago so I can't get too detailed.   Don't expect a diner, it takes a 40 minutes for lunch (without factoring in travel time) and I don't know if it's due to the popularity, the food quality taking longer to make, or the management.   All in all, I recommend this place for some one looking for good quality food in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat brunch! The food is excellent!  Menu with a lot of choices: I can find food that matches with my \"foodmood\". (I discovered the Millionaire's bacon there, melting in mouth, DE-LI-CIOUS!) The waiters are fun and give good advice.  Believe me, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"i was not impressed with the brunch item i ordered (it was a limited edition dish, don't remember what it was) but i really enjoyed the kale tonic. would come again just for that and to try out the avocado toast :)"}
{"text":"I came in around 1 on a Sunday by myself. I was seated immediately. Every staff member I spoke to was so genuinely nice and attentive. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were really, really good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for breakfast! Everything on the menu is delicious and I love all of the healthy options they offer. Their iced coffee is the best! I join the waitlist on the app to help cut down our wait time, especially with having kiddos who start to get antsy while waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Nothing like starting the day off right. Especially on a Monday. Decided to stop in for a quickie. Just eggs toast and sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. The potatoes were on point. And note that they are cooked in a butter substitute, had to ask. But what made my experience the best was my server Zakiya. She was the sweetest woman. She has a great personality and smile and played in to my antics. She's worth a 100% tip. I couldn't have started my weekend off better. I should do this more often."}
{"text":"Came in the morning of the MLK Holiday.  We checked in and sat outside waiting for our table only to have the server come out, call our name, and then tell us, \"oh....there are a lot of groups ahead of you.\"  LOL.  Then after being seated they said that they \"ran out of kids menus\" and \"out of that drink.\"  We had to get up out of our seats to get our own menus.  Seriously?  We have yet to get our food, but the experience so far is making our group question if we'll ever come back.  As of now, my answer is no."}
{"text":"Service is always great and everything we've always ordered has been delicious, but I'd go every weekend for their Avocado Toast alone!!!"}
{"text":"Really great food at a low cost! Why go to Dennys or Ihop? This place is wayyyyy better. I had the chickichanga and it was delicious, my brother had Bubbas Benny and it looked just as good. This place didn't blow me away but it made me so happy and full! I would definitely go again, I'd like to see how their lunches are!"}
{"text":"breastfast during labor day weekend is busy but were able to get seated fast since we added our names on the waitlist in yelp. we got our usual fave avocado toast with greens and tried their french toast. the french toast was good and has a cranberry sauce on the side."}
{"text":"love this location. good ambiance and customer service. i tried their barbacoa benedict and it was delish. my friend, however, had the smoked salmon benedict and was not impressed as it was quite bland."}
{"text":"Everything was so good! The lemon ricotta pancakes and the Market Skillet were delicious. Also the coffee was excellent. I am so glad we decided to come here for our last brunch of the year."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food every single time. Come here, get your breakfast jush. First Watch fucked up my expectations for breakfast food.   Yummy every single time!"}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast yesterday. A few things to note: when you are en route to this place, use the No Wait app to get in line, as this place typically gets packed; parking absolutely sucks so get there early if you want a spot in the lot, or be prepared to park farther away and walk as we had to. Now, this place was great. The decor was rustic and fun with bright windows and a nice warm feel to it. Everyone there was so nice and friendly, which was great. J ordered coffee and I had tea. Our waitress left the coffee and hot water carafes on our table, which was so nice and a check mark in our book. They're menu had a lot of really nice, fresh items and interesting combinations which was great. J ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs, ham, potatoes and toast with homemade strawberry jam. I ordered the smoked salmon and veggie frittata and added mushrooms and broccoli. My frittata came with ciabatta toast and a salad of greens. Everything was delicious and prepared really well. We would definitely recommend this place for breakfast as our experience overall was great."}
{"text":"We go in often with a large group. The owner always looks irritated with us. The severs are amazing and the food is good. But the owner is an asshole."}
{"text":"This is the best place I have had breakfast yet in Phoenix.  I loved every second of it.  The atmosphere is extreme trendy and inviting for an upscale sophisticated breakfast.  You feel as if they are putting in as much effort in the food as they are in the experience.  Everything is good and the service is fantastic.  It is a bit pricey but it is worth every bit.  I would highly recommend to make a trip here...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Cinnamon Roll Waffle and it was really good! The cinnamon syrup and cream cheese icing combo was perfect. The roasted pecans really took everything to the next level! The eggs were on point. The pork sausage wasn't quite as good as I expected, but was still tasty.   My husband cleaned his plate and mine, too. The lack of the last star is due to menu prices. This place was a little on the expensive side, in our opinion."}
{"text":"We've been to First Watch several times now for breakfast and each time go we always feel satisfied when we leave. The food is on the healthier side, and the portions are more in line with what a \"normal\" serving size should be, unlike some places that pile on the food until their patrons are unbuckling their belts and practically throwing up when they walk out the door.   They even find a way to make the potatoes crispy and light instead of weighed down in grease and oil. The food is good, and everything we've tried we have really enjoyed, but if you're looking for a breakfast place that will knock your socks off, you won't find that here. And that's perfectly fine. This place doesn't pretend to be the next best thing since....well I don't know what.... and it doesn't need to because plenty of people like this place for exactly what it is: A healthy, reliable and affordable breakfast eatery that always delivers fresh tasty food with great service. For what it lacks in an adventurous and exciting menu, it makes up for with the quality and consistency of the food that does come out of the kitchen, and that's what keeps people coming back for more.   3.75/5"}
{"text":"First Watch is a little taste of home for me.  I had no idea this was even in the valley until I had a stay cation further up north in Scottsdale.  I have literally never been disappointed in anything I've eaten here.  Pancakes? Amazing.  Omelet? Amazing.  Skillet Hash?  Well...you get it.  I go here every time I'm home in Kentucky so I'm sure you could imagine how excited I was to find out it's in the desert!  It's not quite as amazing as some of the other breakfast places in the valley, but when something reminds you of home it doesn't always matter.  If you're nearby and can pop in, do it !"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst breakfast place in Tempe. They definitely try, and every dish sounds ALMOST perfect but there's always something that comes up just short of okay. Service, in my experience, is also terrible. With all the great breakfast places nearby, I can't imagine this place lasting long."}
{"text":"The interior of First Watch was the first thing that caught my attention. All the tables and decor were very modern, and the ambiance was bright and nice as well.  We were seated quickly, and our waitress was polite and patient. I went with three of my friends, and we got two Strawberry Smashes, one Kale Tonic, and a small grapefruit. The Strawberry Smash was refreshing and similar to lemonade, while the apple in the Kale Tonic was prominent and almost similar to banana. My friend who ordered the grapefruit noted it tasted like orange juice. Furthermore, I loved how the water was self served through a large chilled mason jar. We waited ten to fifteen minutes before our food came, and the presentation of the AM Superfoods Bowl did not disappoint. The coconut milk chia seed pudding was thick, creamy, and very fulfilling. I did not end up finishing the chia seed pudding, and while the whole wheat toast was thick cut and delicious with the almond butter spread, I could not finish it either.  My friend let my try her lemon ricotta pancakes, and they were presented beautifully as well and tasted warm and fluffy. Although I have to admit, the pancakes were a little bland, and I personally thought maple syrup was needed. Another of my friends ordered a side of potatoes. They weren't too bad and were fairly decent. Overall, from the decor to the service to the food, my first experience at First Watch was pleasant, and while not perfect, enjoyable."}
{"text":"Be consist with your check in lists!  We can add to the waitlist at 2 further from our house but not the  new one closest to where we live.  When we asked why they said it's a new system on an app or something.  Use things that are easy for consumers on a platform that everyone uses!    We didn't eat there because of this."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty food. Locally grown. It was a 20 min walk from our downtown hotel. Ordered the avocado toast and healthy turkey breakfast with a chocolate chip pancake. September first - pumpkin EVERYTHING! I highly recommend it! Definitely try the carrot, ginger chai juice!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good First Watch location. The food is always delicious, although the staff can be hit or miss. If you're going to come during a busy time go ahead and put in your name on Yelp. It will save you a lot of wait time!  They recently did away with my most favorite menu item, so I've switched to having the classic eggs benedict, which is really tasty. I definitely recommend it. And my husband absolutely loves the bacado omelet. We've also split their belgian waffle once, and it is seriously so good. The batter is excellent!  They also always have really delicious looking seasonal items, like the cinnamon roll waffle, although I don't usually venture out and try those. However, this past Sunday my husband wanted to try the \"Millionaire's Bacon.\" (Basically candied bacon w/ maple syrup.) I wasn't in the mood but agreed to share it, and boy am I glad I did!!! That bacon was sweet, savory, crunchy, chewy, just.... every amazing sensation your mouth can experience all in one sliver of meat. If you see it on the menu- try it!!   First Watch has tons of comfort food and healthy items, good coffee, fresh juices, etc. There is something for everyone here! If you're in a brunch or lunch mood and want something delicious, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"There may be other breakfast places that are more unique, have better individual menu items, or are more compelling for one reason or another. But over the years, this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent, fast, friendly service. I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good. And I particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what I eat there, I never feel like I just ingested 9lbs of cheese and grease when I'm done. It's all light and healthy and fantastic."}
{"text":"My girlfriend forced me to try this breakfast place and it was a great decision. The food was just amazing and delicious. The only down side was how crowded it was but that is to be expected for a popular place like this one."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh and different breakfast options. Like the coffee pot and jug of water they leave in the table so you can make your own refill when you want/need it. Love their cute little sugar shakers. Great quality food."}
{"text":"Loved a quick Saturday morning breakfast here with absolutely damn-delicious pancakes, french toast, and hash breakfast. We feasted like kings!! Service was adequate but could kick up a notch in my opinion. I can't wait to head back and try them again to see how things are going. Next weekend, perhaps???"}
{"text":"Definitely a great brunch spot you want to check out when you to Phoenix. The kale tonic is beyond amazing, the pancakes are HUGE so watch out when you order them haha and the special I got was SOOOOOO good, it was the chick chimichirri hash. The potatoes were crispy and soft at the same time, the chicken we thinly sliced and juicy, and the sauce was phenomenal. Me and my wife actually wanted to go there the next day for brunch but we decided to go somewhere else because we were only there for two days but I definitely regret not going the next day to it. I literally wanted everything on the menu. The coffee was great. They bring you hazelnut and French vanilla creamer too. I jus all around loved the place. I even liked how we could put our name on the waiting list right away. When me and my wife walked through the door they were already calling our name. Definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"This place is my current breakfast obsession.  The restaurant decor is super cute and the service is great, plus the food is always hot and fresh.  I love the menu and the options are great for any age and any time of day.  Thanks for helping me find a perfect spot for my picky 93 year old grandfather."}
{"text":"I have been to the First Watch in Robinson twice and this is my first time coming to this one. It was also my boyfriends first time eating at first watch! I had the lemon ricotta pancakes which were light and fluffy, and also had delicious lemon curd and strawberries on top. I ordered a side of turkey sausage which was also delicious. My boyfriend got some type of eggs with ham and cheese. He said it was really good but the eggs were a bit runny. We got there at 9:30am just before it became super busy so I would suggest calling ahead or using yelp to secure a table. We will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"My first time here... The food is so delicious. I'll definitely be back. I had the bacado an omelette with bacon avocado sour cream and cheese... Wow delicious!!! Potatoes were so good... I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Never been to this location before and have only been to First Watch once prior to this visit. The atmosphere is nice and open, relaxed feeling. Restrooms were clean. I read reviews on the staff and I didn't find that at all. Our waitress Astacia, I probably just butchered her name :( anyway she was very friendly and took care of us, kept checking on us and all around great service. My mom ordered the ham sandwich melt and tomato basil soup she says it's her favorite and always orders the same thing, my dad ordered the chili chorizo omelette he says it's flavorful and would recommend it, he also ordered the biscuits and gravy and he said he has had better, biscuits are flat said the flavor is not bad and actually compared the biscuits to my moms lol...which is not good hahaha! I had the breakfast tacos and potatoes, I really liked both! Great flavors! I read reviews here on the staff honestly did not find that at all, our waitress was great.  6/5 came for breakfast and sadly I was very disappointed. Our service was terrible. Cierra was our waitress and she just didn't cut it. When my 14 yr old asked her what they had to drink she replied juice and soda... ugh ok what kind of juice what kind of soda? I ask for coffee and water with lemon, she brings my son chocolate milk I had to ask for a straw, she then brings me a dish of lemons and a container of water I asked for ice she came brought the ice and left no straw or offer of a straw... then here comes our food it gets dropped off she doesn't check in and see if we need anything... we sit there and wait.... finally she comes ask her for a box she hurries brings a box and drops off the bill... I felt like she didn't want to take care of us. Our food was ok... warm not hot... idk just not a good experience not sure I'll come back  to this location...  oh and when we arrived it was not busy but we had to wait because there were no tables clean..."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great breakfast. You could tell the food was fresh and my coffee was great for a cold brew. And I must say I am a coffee snob. Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely will be back when I visit Tempe again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for breakfast while downtown on Memorial Day weekend. The food is decent but nothing special. I do appreciate the fact that they had some healthy options on their menu. My husband is more of a steak and eggs type and so he was disappointed by the lack of heartier meals. Both of us thought the service was absolutely horrible. I thought they were just very understaffed that day but my husband had been there on a weekday morning when they were slow and said that it was the same bad service.   All in all, I would not eat there if I had a choice but it is really the only breakfast option downtown besides Matt's which is always a ridiculously long wait."}
{"text":"I work at this place currently, I have never seen such a hard working general manager. Linda is so involved with her guests, kitchen needs and everything! She is always 100% ready to go, so knowledgeable and aware. Very good general manager."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic.     I loved their biscuits and gravy, it was super delicious.  The bacon, although I was told to be thick cut, was very very normal, like 3/16\" cut, instead of the thick I'm used to getting which is more like 5/16-1/4\" stuff.   The coffee is decently strong too.   I ordered an iced coffee, it was very delicious and well balanced.  All-in-all, I really liked this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I tried first watch a few weeks ago. It was very busy on a Saturday morning but only took about 10 minutes to get a table. I wasn't feeling that well so I just ordered soup and a slice of toast. The broccoli cheddar soup was amazing, I got a side of bread too and it was very fresh and delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Coffee is good, service is fast and the fresh fruit crepes are delicious. They come with a large muffin and granola. Almost too much for one person.  Nice and bright inside the restaurant and seating outside as well."}
{"text":"This is conveniently located at 32nd and Camelback and it really has a nice modern feel. Frankie was our friendly and efficient waiter. I love their menu. They offer traditional breakfasts and a few out of the ordinary options. They were featuring a melon drink that looked refreshing, but I needed my coffee. I had the avocado toast that comes with two basted eggs. The toast comes with heaping mounds of avocado with some olive oil and a nice sprinkle of salt. Soooo delicious and fresh.  My lunch partners had the traditional breakfast and the smoked salmon on toast. Both were very happy with their meals. Their portions are generous and priced right.  We realized we were running late part way through our meal and Frankie quickly brought our bill and a take home container.  We will return."}
{"text":"Organic options,  delicious omelets,  kale shake,  nice patio area,  we love the organic and healthy food options."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place for brunch.  The food uses local produce and organic ingredients to make breakfast and lunches that are all kinds of delicious.  The staff seated us promptly and we got coffee - damned fine coffee - right away.  Although the traditional breakfasts looked good as did the omelets but the French toast caught our eye.  The hubby had the traditional French toast and I opted for the Floridian French toast that came on brioche and piled high with berries, kiwi and bananas.  It was fabulous with the pure organic maple syrup.  A fantastic treat and a brunch to start a lazy Sunday.  Well worth it.  Great food, staff and use of local ingredients.  I also love that this is a local restaurant and not a chain.  It is worth any wait."}
{"text":"Won't be returning.  Fresh OJ was my favorite part. Really delicious! Salmon & roasted veggie frittata was good, but the roasted veggies were just tossed in, not cut up, so it was awkward to eat, and the random greens on the plate were barely dressed, so I had to request dressing. The elevated egg sandwich was descent. The chocolate chip pancake my 3yo had was good.   Now the bad...  Service was .  We had a group of 10.  Waitress took all our orders long hand and only checked on our table twice.  My husband ordered his drinks (iced tea and small OJ) last, and got them both first. Took another 5 minutes until I finally got my large OJ. Conversely, everyone else received their food order and his came last several minutes after everyone had already started eating.  Waitress dropped off our check and never asked if we needed to-go boxes or cups. When we requested them, she had her fingers in the cups when she brought them out, and had spots of syrup around the rim. Gross.   My BIGGEST gripe was the kids crepe with fresh fruit we ordered for our 1yo. IT WASNT COOKED. It was BLONDE. Barely cooked and falling apart against the fruit that was rolled into it. I ended up shoving it aside and feeding her only the fresh fruit. And for whatever weird reason, instead of offering scrambled egg or breakfast meat (like my son had with his pancake) they served her meal with toast, jam, and a tiny cup of granola. Is she supposed to be filling up on carbs in preparation for a marathon or something? Weird dish. Who serves toast with another bread item like crepes or pancakes?   $45 + tip was entirely too much for a 'meh' meal and nearly non-existent service.   Essentially, this place lives up to its name. You like it upon your first watch, and then you get up close and realize it's mediocre at best. Not impressed and won't be recommending."}
{"text":"My \"Go To\" choice for Brunch.  Such healthy, colorful and tasty choices.  The service has been great, too.  I have taken family and out of town guests here too and we all have been pleased. Avocado Toast is outstanding with ample use of avocado, not just a trace."}
{"text":"This place is WOAH mismanaged! The last time I was here for lunch we waited like 15 minutes to try to get the waitress's attention for a check. Today I left my work quickly to pick food up, and it's terrible. Like shouldn't be served terrible. My avocado chopped salad had about 2oz of bad (like past it prime lettuce) and came without avocado or chicken!!! And the soup which they told me was chicken with wild rice is some sort of cream soup with no rice or chicken (from what I can tell maybe cream of mushroom?). Both were the skimpiest, most pathetic portions I've ever seen. And I'm a clinical nutritionist, so I know what proper portion sizes are. When I got back to my job and called to complain the manager did offer me free coupons, but I'm now stuck here at work starving. In theory this place is a great idea, but it's def not worth it. Also, I would like to post photos, but it's not letting me..."}
{"text":"We love the healthy options at First Watch. They offer a farm to table concept and use fresh ingredients. For the coffee lovers they have flavored creamer which is rare for restaurants. They also have coffee available in their waiting area. Food was great!"}
{"text":"My very first visit here and let me tell you! Very pleased with my meal. Modern rustic, farm house atmosphere. I will continue to visit every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast,  the morning meditation is awesome. The food is fantastic, I enjoy this so place, outside seating, cannot go wrong here. I had the veg omelet,  fantastic and the Lemon ricotta multi grain pancakes are out of this world. A great place to check out."}
{"text":"Came to have brunch with my family on a Sunday. The wait wasn't too bad (about 10 minutes or so) and the hostess was very friendly. We sat down and were immediately offered coffee (decaf for myself) which is a plus because we were all wanting coffee! I ordered a crepe with fruit and yogurt for my son which was brought out first and I appreciated. For myself I ordered a smoked salmon Benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon was delicious! the bread had a nice crunch to it but wasn't too hard and the potatoes were amazing. I also ordered one of their fresh juices (can't remember the name of it now). It had carrot and ginger and some other ingredients which I can't remember but it was amazing! My son even loved the juice so much I had to order another one for us to share! I loved this place so much! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my barbacoa Benedict and our server, Rachel, really did a great job taking care of us! Will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"let's get this straight: 2 stars for the food, but if i could, i'd give our waitress Corrie zero stars.  i tried a bacon cheddar pancake, with two eggs and a sausage link. the eggs and sausage were a bit cold when they reached the table. also, i could taste that the eggs were cooked in margarine, or some sort of other cooking spray. the pancake was amazing, believe it or not.  the waitress, however, was terrible. she clearly didn't want to wait on our table. and believe me, we're not a couple of hellraisers or anything. as i've noted in my other reviews: keep my drink filled, bring my food, ask if we need anything else, and boom--we're happy.  as soon as we were seated, Corrie asked \"so are you ready to order?\" mind you, we hadn't even opened the menus yet. as soon as our food came to the table, she presented us with our check. she never came back to ask if we needed anything, and our drinks went unfilled.  i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if the mood strikes and i want brunch, i wouldn't rule this place out, either."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make breakfast and do it right. Sustainably sources food, great prices and friendly staff.  Def. has a hipster vibe but I don't feel out of place wearing  my American flag shirt."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Okay, so it was like 45 minutes before they close.  I should have known better.  I ordered the BLTE, which is supposed to be a Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato sandwich with a fried egg added.  I would think that on a sandwich like this, the Bacon would be the star, but alas this was not to be.  What little bacon that was on the sandwich, maybe a slice and a half, was burnt black and crisp, it kinda looked like they dredged it up from the bottom of somewhere just so they could get back to closing down the line (45 minutes early).  The rest of the sandwich was great - the egg was fried perfectly, cheese was all melted and apart from the disappointing bacon, not a bad sandwich.  I\"m sorry I bothered them so late in the day.  I learned my lesson.  I'll be back, but only for breakfast.  Addendum:  Hi Eleni, thank you for your reply.  I'd just like to let you know that I most certainly know the difference between smoked (dark) meat, and greasy, bottom of the bin leftover bacon.  I\"m sorry I neglected to take any photos, that would have shown everybody what it looked like.  OTOH, maybe that is a good thing for you.  I've been a customer of First Watch on and off for over twenty years, at different locations, of course, but I will say this is the first time I came for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at First Watch and the food was good but the service that Jojo gave my family and I was great! She was very attentive and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"I got the elevated egg sandwich. It was really good and they have a bunch of healthy options for those health conscious. The service pretty much sucked. I was here on Monday morning so not busy at all - no wait or anything, but asked for water multiple times without getting it. He even came to take my food order without having brought it yet. Never once came to check on me once my food was delivered and just overall not very friendly. Hostess who I settled my payment with was sweet."}
{"text":"I was visiting and looking for somewhere to grab a quick healthy bite to eat before heading off to a hike near Saguaro. The food was delicious. I got a California breakfast burrito and one of the juices.   The service was great. I used the Yelp NoWait to get in line ahead of time. Even though I technically missed my turn in line, they were happy to seat me right away.   I would happily come back here again."}
{"text":"Great menu however be ready for big bill $$. What happened to a simple straightforward breakfast."}
{"text":"Great menu options! I got a breakfast sandwich! Life changing adding avocado to an egg sandwich!! The staff was super nice and the environment was very welcoming :)"}
{"text":"We've been coming here every Sunday for a month now.  It's such a great place and the food is very good.  There is a lot of healthy options too. It gets really busy after 10am, but the service is always friendly and quick.  We will continue coming here every week."}
{"text":"This place has so much going for it, good parking, Beautiful clean interior, food is tasty with nice plating, presentation & diverse menu. BUT.... don't ask for cottage cheese!!! First off your waitress will not verbally respond but roll her eyes & walk away leaving you perplexed wondering if you were unaware you have Tourette's. Upon her return \"no, we only have enough for the special this week\" so apparently they can't spare (a square) any cottage cheese.  What?? Just silly!"}
{"text":"New favorite!! Great location right off University and Mill. Warm and welcoming ambience and staff. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought into the design, decor, service, menu, and flow of the restaurant. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating available. In case there is a wait, there are comfortable seats and a cute little coffee station at the entry.   Menu looked delightful and it was tough deciding what to order. Coffee comes with a carafe and they have a bowl of different flavored creamers as well as fancy sugar. They also provide a cold carafe of water for the table.   Decided to try the kale tonic and was a little nervous it would be too grainy but it was so incredibly fresh, sweet and flavorful! Definitely a must try! For brunch we ordered the Italian omelet which came with sausage, roasted peppers, tomatoes and some kind of cheese, served with a side of lightly seasoned greens. Also ordered the elevated egg sandwich -- omg it was so fresh and good! It came with a side of seasoned potatoes so it was nice and filling. Kids menu also has some great, affordable options. We went with the fresh egg which came with bacon, toast and a small bowl of fruit- generous for around $5.75.   There aren't too many breakfast spots in this part of Tempe so First Watch is an excellent addition and we'll definitely become regulars at this gem!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience!  We stop here every year when we go to spring training.  The coffee is excellent along with the service.   Plus food wise they have something for everyone.  Weather you are a traditional eggs and waffle with bacon, or Kale/extremely healthy diet kinda' person.  Obviously I'm the former.   I've also noticed that no matter which location we dine at the experience is just as great, so kudo's to ownership for maintaining the high standards.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"A nice place for breakfast/brunch.  Good food with plenty of options. I had three cranberry nut pancakes, and I was stuffed when I left.   The cost seemed fair, and the service was fine.  I wasn't wowed, but I'd return to try other foods."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this location and on Thomas. Serve at both was very good. Unique menu items. Food was very good. A nice place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was told to check First Watch out for their amazing breakfast and was a bit skeptical but my friend was adamant that we go!  We were instantly greeted and taken to the best seat in the entire restaurant. It was almost like we had the entire place to ourselves.   Andrea quickly came over and took our drink orders and made some recommendations. I couldn't decide between the Farmhouse hash and the Elevated Egg sandwich so I asked Andrea for her expert opinion.   I ended up getting the Elevated Egg sandwich and I did not go wrong. The Egg was perfectly cooked and topped with some huge chunks of Avocado and the brioche bun was  The roasted potatoes that came on the side was a nice addition and perfectly cooked.   I'd highly recommend this place to everyone and will surely be bringing my friends who visit when they are in town."}
{"text":"Went on the advice of a friend as we were passing thru on our way to Colorado. I'm glad we listened. Service was amazingly fast and food was so fresh and refreshing. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"One of the most consistently fresh, varied menus for breakfast in Cleveland. Always friendly staff, sometimes a wait on Sat or Sun am, but well worth it. Amazing pancake options."}
{"text":"First time here, it was a full house! I ordered the half sandwich and half salad lunch special. Club sandwich and avocado chop salad. Service was fast , and the salad was even better! Half of club sandwich was loaded! Looked like a full sized sandwich! I'll be back thanks again!  Fourth time here in the past month. This morning I ordered the Farm stand breakfast tacos and side of bacon.           Back again! I really can't get enough of this place ! It is now my favorite breakfast and lunch place!"}
{"text":"They serve more than breakfast but to me this is a breakfast spot. I have been there several times and the food is always good. We would probably go more often but there are several other places closer to our house that we like also. They can be busy, busy at breakfast time. This time there was over an hour wait unless you wanted to eat at a community table. We chose to eat at the community table and had a 5 minute wait. The community table was fine. There was two different groups at the table but we did not find this distracting or interfering with out conservations.  There are several First Watches around and my wife really likes to eat there. You will too. Just be prepared to wait on weekends especially when spring training is going on. If crowded try the community table.  Give them a try. I put down they have outside seating. I am pretty sure they do anyway."}
{"text":"So delish!!! Love their menu! The signage should be different... it doesn't look like a restaurant.  Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great food Great service, our server was Holly & she took great care of us while we were enjoying breakfast.This First Watch has been there for 30yrs & they are still consistently serving great food & providing great service. Im definitely having breakfast there again when Im in Phoenix. Plenty of parking, clean & great energy from the staff & customers."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The staff were friendly. The environment was very nice. We got there on a \"busy \" Saturday afternoon. Our wait time was told to be 30 minutes but we only waited 15, thats a win in my opinion ! The only reason I'm giving 3/5 stars is our specific waitress only came to our table once. After being seated it took her a little while to come greet us. After some time she came and took our drink order along with our entrees. And that was it, never came back to deliver our food or ask us how our meal was nor did she come to refill our waters or as us if we needed anything. Luckily I had water bottles in my bag, and babywipes for napkins so I didn't have to bother anyone else. I understand it's Saturday and it was slightly busy, but she should've stopped by our table at least once during our 45 minute dine in. But it was clearly not busy when she saw the tip and swiped it up as soon as we got up to go pay for our meal.  Over all, I do plan on coming back, just having my fingers crossed for a different or more attentive waiter."}
{"text":"Traditional Breakfast,  Eggs were outstanding, sausage was cooked perfectly, and the potatoes were great with that nice crunch on the edges.  I have driven by this restaurant many times and decided to try something new, was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and the terrific service by Ashtin.  The restaurant is well kept with a very nice interior, not real busy during the week which is nice.  Very nice hidden gem, will be back again"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Great service! Their fresh juices are amazing, the plates are generous, and the service is better than average. They're the best breakfast food in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"NOT dog friendly!  Just opened, absolutely no other customers, but wouldn't let me be at an outside, sidewalk table with my 4lb purse pup.  The tables are on a public sidewalk of a strip center.  If you have a dog, go to the Hilton, right next door. They sat me at a lovely table near the pool."}
{"text":"Casual breakfast place with a good amount of options. I've been to a few of the locations. The avocado toast is my favorite dish. It's light and filling at the same time. Prices are decent- about less than $15 a person depending on what you get."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I walked in and was seated right away. I requested a patio table. As I was sitting I was asked what I would like to drink. I requested coffee and water. The drinks were then brought out pretty fast without asking I needed cream or sugar but asked for my order. I ordered the summer special Crab and Asparagus Omelette and he said I will be back with a basket for you. I see every other table has a basket with salt,pepper, hot sauce,cream etc   So I assumed he would be back with my cream, but no. So I drank half of my coffee before I was done and just wish I had a bit of cream to put in. Then another server came with my food. As she was dropping it off she said she is now the one talking care of me and took off. I did not have a chance to ask for pepper or hot sauce, which I really wanted, or that cream I still never got. The server did. It come back for 30 min. I was finished with my food by then and all she did was take the plate and drop the check and told me to have a great day.    The food was good! It wasn't great, but good. It lacked flavor that I really wish I had the pepper and hot sauce for and was barely stuffed with crab and asparagus. I probably won't be back. For the price and what I got in food and service I will dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try First Watch after friends in other states recommended it. We went on a Thursday around 10:15 and didn't have to wait. The inside isn't very big but has a nice farmhouse feel to it. We really enjoyed our food- the chickichanga was a unique and flavorful burrito with a tasty sauce. The ingredients were all very fresh and I really liked how the side of fruit was actually fresh, seasonal fruit and not a bland or frozen mix. My mom had the biscuits and gravy which was also very tasty and well seasoned. Our favorite was the Million Dollar Bacon. We ordered it in addition to our meals and it's the best bacon we've ever had- almost like a dessert with the caramelized brown sugar and maple syrup on it. We'll be back to try some lunch items!  Update- went back again today and still loving this place. Had the plain pancakes and they were really tasty. Served with warm maple syrup-yum! My mom enjoyed her skillet as well- the toast was so nice and thick!"}
{"text":"I love their food and healthy options but absolutely hate their coffee! Which is weird because I'm a coffee lover who's totally not picky, but their cold brew was quite awful, but it may just be my preference! The service is always pretty quick and friendly. The place is close to campus so be prepared for crowded brunch rushes! We often go here for a nice healthy breakfast. I would recommend it for small parties or a nice cafe style bite to eat."}
{"text":"I was here once a few years ago and was stoked to try a new breakfast place since I was staying downtown all weekend. Last time, I thought I remember enjoying it, but this time not so much. First of all, I am going to say that I went there Saturday at 9:30AM and again Sunday at 8:15AM. Saturday was obviously better for me.  Saturday, we a had pretty cool waiter who was attentive enough but I bet it was because he had other tables nearby, so we were easier to wave him over. I got the Chickichanga, which I loved (got it both mornings) but I was annoyed that the onions I asked them to hold was throughout my meal. I could barely taste them and was on a schedule so I didn't complain. My colleague asked for no spinach in her egg skillet, and it was throughout. You cannot miss huge spinach leaves laid through an egg and cheese skillet. She didn't say anything and just ate it. The coffee was just ok, the prices were a little high, and the selection was limiting. The ice tea was good though, and they gave us a to go cup! Not bad. Got them a 3.  Then I come to Sunday. My wife, 4 year old and I went there. There was literally ONLY two other tables of customers. We were seated by someone who looked like a host or manager, but then it was 10 minutes before anyone bothered coming over. I finally went, found her, and asked for coffee. I figured she'd come right over. She walked in the back, talked to someone else, and then a few minutes later a lady ran over with a coffee carafe. She filled us up and didn't bother asking if my child wanted or needed anything. She left. I had to go find someone to order a drink after 5 minutes later for my child.The same lady came back and I asked her her name (I don't remember now) and she said America is my server, but she was helping her out (why? America had ONE other table!). We ordered my kid some milk and then our food. After 15 minutes, I went to find out where the hell my kid's milk was. America brought it right over and also an extra water, then she disappeared without asking if we needed anything else.   At this point, there was 3 server staff (America, the other hispanic lady, and a guy) and only TWO tables (the place is not large, I could see all of the tables from mine). Fifteen minutes later we got our meals. I got the same meal as the day before because I knew what to expect. This time, no onions which was good. We ate, paid almost $30 for three of us (my kid ONLY got toast), and got the heck out of there.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good, high-quality food. I hate to admit that from a chain restaurant, but yeah, it was good. And when I left, there was a long wait out front, so obviously others like this place.  I had french toast and potatoes. The potatoes were really good, with grilled onions in 'em. The french toast was very good. Warm Log Cabin syrup -- I hope that have 'real' syrup or my wife won't love this place. My friend had the pancake, which looked like a really good, quality pancake.  The coffee was good, not great.  The staff is great.  My only complaint is that it's one of those places where you pay at a cash register. Kind of a peeve of mine -- so, I have to wait in line on the way in and the way out? Who thinks that's a good idea?"}
{"text":"I adore this place. The staff is super friendly, the food is superb and they recently spiced up their decor, very retro ish. We come here a lot and will be for years to come :)"}
{"text":"Unimpressed so far as it's taken 10 minutes to get my first cup of coffee and the restaurant is only about 1/2 full.  The lady in front of me at check-in asked for a table towards the back and all but one wasn't clean.    Probably what I get for going to a corporate chain restaurant instead of the norm of local business.  Updates to follow....  So...order was wrong, but the service, after the coffee debacle was fair.  Food was ok at best.  Can't say I won't be back.  It'll just be very low on the list."}
{"text":"After looking online at the waitlist, we shot over, being told that we'd have no wait. We arrived to a staff that had lost control of the restaurant. The kitchen staff had told the overwhelmed hosts to slow everyone down, and we were quoted a 45 min wait. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always feel like home here, great coffee, great folks, million dollar bacon is to die for! A++++"}
{"text":"This is either first or second on my list of breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale!  My girlfriends and I come here at least once a week.  Their food is addictive.  Coffee is good.  My girlfriend who introduced me to First Watch swears by the Turkey Dill Crepegg.  I'm a huge fan of the Acapulco Express, Sonoran Fritatta and the Chicken Salad Melt.  I'm drooling as I type this because it's all so good.  The staff is nice, always makes sure you have something to drink and they're fast!  The colors in this place shift my mood to cheery every time I'm there.  Sunday mornings can be busy, but it's no biggie- they have tables and benches outside to chill out on."}
{"text":"Love this First Watch location! Staff is kind, attentive and happy to see you. Food is delicious and menus are fitting for all diets and preferences. Grab a coffee to go on your way out!   And if you need a suggestion on what to order? Breakfast tacos for life - trust me."}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients, really tasty food, and great service. Definitely worth the time we waited to be seated."}
{"text":"Yup, this is as good as everyone says. Great selection, friendly staff and fresh food.  This will be a regular stop in the future."}
{"text":"Wow what a fantastic experience. You gotta try it! We had the new fall breakfast with kale mushrooms onions and garlic harvest egg in a hole and also the bubbas Benny with the biscuits and gravy. Elaine was wonderful bringing out a multi grain strawberry whipped cream pancake on the house for my husbands birthday which was very tasty. She even gave me coffee to go. Don't miss this treasure!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here for breakfast on the weekends! The food is always delicious and the staff is very friendly and courteous. HOWEVER, during our last visit, we noticed a gentleman standing around, near the hostess stand, performing the duties of the hostess. He had such an unfriendly personality, never smiled and was not courteous at all. This was so uncharacteristic of First Watch! When we inquired about him, we learned his name was Tim and he was the regional manager. We were so surprised! We expected a manager to visit with the customers, not stand around and get in the way! We were quite disappointed in his behaviour and demeanor."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good breakfast spot. There was a bit of a wait but things moved quickly. They have some great breakfast options with a Southwest Influence. My skillet was outstanding, the juice was fresh, and my server was friendly. They also have some outdoor seating, although it's basically in a strip mall (a trend I noticed in Scottsdale), so the view is t spectacular. Overall, a solid breakfast spot."}
{"text":"My BFF ate at the Nashville FW n decided to try Matthew's FW. Oh boy, what a treat!!! We had to bring home what we couldn't finish so that tells you it's a hearty amount served. Very tasty and full of body...that's cuz i just had to have my two juicy sunny side up liquify all over my hash potatoes (tho, they were chunky, not the normal strips of potatoes fried together).  The comfortable furnishings of simply piped, wooden shelving and barn like wooden flooring said \"come on in and enjoy textures for your eyes.\" We were constantly looking around in search of more. It was a good crowd but not too crowded to be uncomfortable as the seat spacing must hv bn well considered. Only bummer was our coffee tasted burnt. Should hv spoken up.   Hurry n come on over to Waxhaw, pleeeasssse.  04-28-18 Here again. Morning Meditation drink is a bit too sweet for me. Says agave but still in good proportions makes for a better drink. The young crowd tolerates n crave sweetness but servers should ask sweetness preference! Yah, why don't they? Wouldn't that be a good trend to start?  Service is slow td. I've already finished my iced tea. First day I gave it a five star. Td it's disappointingly slOw. Even just to be served water or being asked for more iced tea took a while. Hey FW, u hv a management problem td. Our time is being wasted waiting on such a gorgeous spring day! In fact, I'm becoming upset about this. Life is waning n I'm seeing a waitress asking customers whether what she's holding are their dishes?!? Sooo many unserved tables WAITING. Now it's only TWO stars for the furnishings n I'm freezing in here. My protein dish was served cold. He's bringing me another but I hate that cuz u never know if they spat in it.   If u hv a lot of free time, enjoy it here. But, for those who don't, I advise u not. Raw yolk over easy need to be served rt away, don't let it sit on counter too long. I don't want to be sick.  05-03-18 Ok Management Team, thanks for reaching out. That gives you FOUR stars for effort n since FW just recently opened I'm considering that as well. Unfortunately, spring weekends are  precious n that waiting time cost me outdoor time so please keep training your team. We'll be back when the roasting summer arrives so as not to waste anymore outdoor time.   Heard there's a new FW opening in Waverly!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have another location that I went to every so often but it was a little out of my way. Now they've opened a new location and it's close to my work. These restaurants should sell stock, because I'd buy a lot of it. Their menu is healthy, fresh and delicious - perfect for today's day and age. As far as what I like, their power wrap and the avocado toast are two of my favorites. If you live near the airpark, you need to try this place!"}
