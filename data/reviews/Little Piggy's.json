{"text":"I've been here twice- once for the kbbq and once for the UFO fried rice + ddeokbokki. 

The first time I had kbbq here, it was pretty good; we got the BBQ set with pork + beef. It came with a lot of side dishes and vegetables, 2 bowls of rice. The meat was super fresh and it was really good! 

The second time I came here I got ddeokbokki + kimchi bacon UFO fried rice with a friend. The food was okay, but I feel like they could have added more rice cakes in the ddeokbokki, as I felt a bit dissatisfied in how little rice cakes there were in the dish. The fried rice was okay, we added cheese to it (which cost an extra $3). 

Overall, I would probably come back again if someone asked me to but not on my own will."}
{"text":"Little Piggy's is a new addition to the Annex. My first time here was great. Walking into the restaurant, I could tell that a lot of thought was put into the interior design. Unlike other Korean restaurants which hold utensils in a container on the table, the tables here have drawers that can pull out revealing chopsticks and spoons. The prices are very reasonable - $8.95 for bibimbap of all different varieties. They have standard beef and egg, spicy octopus, pork and sprouts, chicken, and fish egg. I had the fish egg bibimbap which was delicious! Their side dishes had the standard kimchi and picked vegetables, along with two types of salad, tofu and pasta. 

Since they just opened, their service can be a bit spotty. -1 star for that and the lacklustre soft-serve ice cream at the end of my meal. Although it was free, I felt like it was missing flavour and sugar. Great time nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Food was kind of bland, was really disappointed in the kim chi and bacon rice. Didn't taste the bacon or the kim chi. The rice cake was too soft. Bulgogi was good but not much meat. 

We also ordered the blue lemonade and it was the sweetest thing ever. We told thr waiter and he said he couldn't change that because the sugar they use is what makes it blue.

Service was fantastic though, super nice waiters."}
{"text":"Everything we've had were very well seasoned and balanced. While most Korean places near Christie are stuck in the 80s with heavy use of MSG and salt, this place executes modern Korean cuisine very well.

Instead of more commonly used gas grill, they use induction cooktops for table grilling, so the air in the place is less stuffy and we walked out not smelling like K-bbq which is a big plus.

Definitely worth the 1hr drive from Oakville."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but was so disappointed in this place that I just can't not. The quality of meat is not good, which is surprising considering the not cheap price. And the servers do not know how to cook meat. I was appalled when they started to try to place the meat on a not hot grill! I would think that this is basic common knowledge for everyone in general, not to mention for servers who work at a bbq restaurant. The beef lost what little flavor and juice it had to begin with because they seemed to have no clue. The marinated beef was the lowest quality in the combo we got which included pork and beef, and it was close to a greyish color. I think I have only seen meat like that at an AYCE establishment. After I mentioned the beef was not tasty because it was not grilled well (the first time I let the servers assist in the grilling), they gave us some type of scrap meat and called it \"on the house\"...which I think made the situation worse. I can't even compare this place to the north location Piggy Piggy, which also in my opinion has gone downhill. I was so excited to try this place as I was looking for a good Korean bbq restaurant downtown, but I guess I will still have to travel to North York. The only good thing about this place is the grapefruit soju."}
{"text":"The food in this place wayyyyyyy exceeded my expectation. I was blown away by how flavourful the Tofu Stew is. And the price is very decent. It's amazing how you walked into a random restaurant and food in here made your day. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Tried their pork bone soup and grilled beef. Reasonable price and they constantly ask to refill your side dishes.  The only drawback is the smell and smoke since many people order the grilled."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe as soon as you walk into this place. I went in around 3-4pm on Thursday and it was dead (which may have been a good thing since I noticed in other reviews that people were complaining about the service) Luckily for me, the service was excellent. One of the employees was on his break and still gave me extra napkins without me even asking and the other employees were nice as well. I had the UFO spam x kimchi fried rice with cheese and it was really great, never had anything quite like it and my boyfriend had the sizzling pork. Both dishes were really good. I would definitely come back here again because there's no other Korean restaurant quite like it. And also the music was good!"}
{"text":"Try a few times for lunch and love the Pork Bone soup here.. can tell the best compare to other Korean restaurant. The services is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Attended a Meetup here and was pretty impressed! Good array of menu items and tasty dishes! I especially liked the UFO rice with beef and the ddeokbokki started out sweet with a nice spicy kick afterwards.  I also ordered the mix combo which consisted of samgyupsal, beef and garlic pork. This was pretty decent.

The service was pretty attentive as far as some Korean restaurants go (no call buttons!). 

Overall a very decent night!  I'd like to try to sister restaurant in Thornhill."}
{"text":"New Korean spot in my neighbour.  Never tried their BBQ b4 but had ordered their spicy pork before.  Came here this afternoon to try their stew dish.  The restaurant seemed quite empty with Bloor BIA outside.  Tried their pork bone soup for a start.  To be honest, I felt they made their dish quite different from other places in Korean town, so people probably would hate it or love it.  I had the same feeling when I first had their spicy pork.  As the pork tasted quite dry unlike other places.  Side dish was kinda bland especially kimchi.  Main dish itself also didn't impress at all.  I didn't taste any spiciness at all from pork bone soup.  Won't say I hate it, but I don't like it either.  The environment looks chic and clean as restaurant is practically empty.  I thought complementary ice cream would be given if paid by cash but I guess no more.  Also lunch special was $7.95 as written outside but I guess that was only for weekdays, as I was charged full price.  Service is fine.
Overall I don't think I will try their stew or grill items again but BBQ maybe if my fiends want to try it."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and the restaurant  was not busy. Overall the food was fresh and delicious with reasonable portions. Serviers were attentive. I would come again. 

Food:
There were 3 of us and we ordered the 2 people beef combo (added the rice and soybean soup) and a seafood pancake. It came with 6 side dishes. It also comes with a plate with 3 different types of sauce and lettuce to eat the meat with. Portions were enough for us. They use quality meat so the combo is a great experience. Beef was in large pieces, flavourful and juicy. You have the option of grilling it yourself but we preferred the server to grill it for us. 

Service:
Place was clean and seemed like it was renovated. Compared to their other restaurant in North York, the seating here is much more comfortable and spacious. The service here was good too, they came to check up and see if you needed anything."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review for Piggy's in Koreatown north (Yonge/Finch).  While there I saw a sign for the grand opening of \"Little Piggy's.\"  As far as I can   tell it's the same menu or at least it will have all the #1 hits from the mother ship.

This location is new, clean and spacious.  Will take some wear and tear before there is a vibe to the place.  I had....gamja tang (pork bone soup).  As usual.  And it was excellent, obviously the same recipe as Piggy's.  It was important for me to know that a top quality flavourflav soup was closer to home.  Perhaps next time I'll try something else on the menu.  Probably not."}
{"text":"I came to this place to get lunch takeout when I was in the area. They have a great deal where you can get a bulgogi bowl for $7 taxes in. :) The bowl came with choice of beef or chicken bulgogi, carrots, lettuce, cucumber and rice. The flavours in the bowls really packed a punch. There is a topping center where you can put your choice of sesame oil, spicy mayo etc. on top before you grab it to go. You can also get an additional 2 sides for $9.99 total. Overall great place for lunch takeout."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service is slow, but in general, I would rate this spot a 2 thumbs up.  The induction cookers make for increased surface area, which is crucial when sharing the table with more than 2 people.  Banchan is not an afterthought (as with most other restaurants) - every dish is tasty and often varied from visit to visit (ie:  they have an assortment of banchan).  I must admit I've only ever had the samgyeopssal (pork belly) in the 3 times I've gone, simply because it was SO good.  I loved the Korean Sake (CheongHa).  I would skip out on the tteokbokki.  COME HERE FOR THE MEAT!  Also important, this establishment is clean and spacious!"}
{"text":"I love korean food, but this place was very disappointing. We were a group of 7 and we all unfortunately agree that we will never come back.  We ordered bbq meat and was astonished by how expensive it was.  We made several orders of meat, and each order is $35 but was not enough for one person.  We also ordered the kalbi beef, which was again was very small and expensive compared to other korean restaurants.  The meat was tasteless even though it was supposed to be marinated and flavoured. The UFO rice was ok, but I don't think you can mess up fried rice when you mix it with cheese and egg.  The glass noodle dish we ordered, the noodles were overcooked which you can tell by the thickness of the noodles.  I wanted so hard to like this place but it was terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent food but on the pricier side of kbbq. Their side dish of mashed potatoes was really good though!"}
{"text":"the menu makes no sense and servers are noobs for BBQ. The beef they grilled tasted like disgusting boiled beef."}
{"text":"It's about time that a decent Korean restaurant moves out of the safe haven for Korean restaurants at Christie/Bloor and gets some more mainstream exposure further east.  Good thing that Little Piggy's does a good job of representing some Korean classics, ie. bbq, dolsot bibimbap, etc. but also adds something to the Korean resto landscape with honey comb ice cream (which was unfortunately unavailable).  We enjoyed the seafood pancake, Don Katsu (not a traditional Korean dish) and the steamed egg.  What really stood out during our visit was the service.  The space was also very kid-friendly and the staff were very accommodating. :)"}
{"text":"Always go there. The have the best Ganjia Tang in DT. Strong soup and tasty pork bone meat. Price for single Ganjia Tang is reasonable,with tax and tip included.$12. Their marinated beef BBQ taste tender and the flavour is penatrated.However the portion is little and it's a little bit pricy. With tip and tax it goes up to $70+."}
{"text":"Food is always good and you leave there belly full. Service is good and love the new decor. The chicken, beef bulgogi are delicious. My favorite dish is the chicken bimbimbap. It's not greasy and portion is perfect for 1 person."}
{"text":"Their waiters and waitresses were unfriendly and seemed really stuck up and kept ingoring us lmao (probably like a 12-15 ppl group). We even said please and thanked them everytime they came to help us so the service was utterly terrible. 

Skimpy on the side dishes. I mean your meat grill price was really up there in the $$$$$ the least you could do is offer more side dishes. Like 4 of us had to share 1 persons worh of side dishes and then if we wanted refills we had to order more food which was really sad. 

The food was actually really really really great like thank god their food came with rice free of charge or i wouldve been devastated and just given this place 1 star lmao. Never going back cause their front house team just sucks. Props to you back of the house, the food was so bomb (I didnt order the table grilling and havent even tried it so i dont even know if the meat cut/grade was worth the high price)."}
{"text":"great plum juice // great bb-bop // great service // highly recommended

definitely a must eat in the toronto area. authentic"}
{"text":"Careful! Their menu implies dishes are including tastes (like cheese & onion), but they charge extra. Some appetizers are included; some aren't. ASK!!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place...

On one hand, their Korean BBQ and all their bibimbaps (especially chili octopus) are fantastic. These items are what keeps me coming back to this place. 

On the other hand, everything else I have tried isn't so great. The octopus cheese fondue thing is decent but not amazing. It kind of lacks flavour. The UFO fried rice (I tried kimchi tuna and chicken) is honestly bland. It's also pretty pricy considering you can get that anywhere else on bloor for significantly less. 

Bottom line.. if you're not here for KBBQ I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This resto recently under went some renovations and the place looks great,so modern! The spoons and chop sticks are in a drawer on the side of your table, so it's accessible anytime. 
The service was very good, they were always attentive when we needed something. 
The food was so good very flavourful. The atmosphere is very fun and lively, even got my first experience of drinking from a lightbulb 

Their short ribs are really good along with the UFO (which is a pretty big portion). Their little side dishes of pickled cucumber,kimchi,chopped suey are really good and it's \"à volonté\".

I live in Montreal and I would definitely comeback to eat here next time I'm in TO. I'd also recommend it to anyone looking for a good Korean restaurant. It both a all you can eat and a à la carte type of restaurant. 

1 slight downfall -  Leaving the resto you smell like a walking,talking grilled piece of meat, so don't wear any nice clothes!"}
{"text":"their UFO fried rice dish is a must try. Korean bbq is also very good!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to try real traditional Korean BBQ - this is your place to go. 
Our group of 10 ordered a few plates of meat - beef and pork belly and their squid with cheese fondue. 

You can really taste the quality in the meat that they give you. And the best part is you get a lot of side dishes, and various sauces, lettuce and garlic to go with your wrap. 

The cheese fondue was good but the meat is the real winner here. The service was efficient and very attentive. The cost can add up given the price of the meat but it is worth it, given the quality."}
{"text":"Finally, I don't have to go all the way uptown for some good kbbq! I've never been to the original piggy's uptown so I can't compare between the two. 

We ordered the mix combo which consists of samgyupsal, beef and garlic pork - 41.95. I find it's a good deal because you get a good variety. All the meats were delicious and flavourful, I enjoyed them all! And their side dishes that they provide are so good especially their seaweed soup! I also find the lettuce for the wraps are big and enough for the whole meal. The servers are also really kind and don't mind refilling your side dishes.

Their induction heating pad is pretty neat because it doesn't make our hair or clothes smell afterwards which is awesome. Don't forget to check in for a free milk ice cream (which our server was confused about). I'm assuming not every staff knows about this offer? The milk ice cream was alright. Definitely check this place out if you're at the Annex!"}
{"text":"A fun food experience. We had the table cooked garlic pork with the soybean stew and rice. Everything was tasty. Service was excellent. A great place to go with a group of friends. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Another favourite of mine near campus! Their UFO Fried Rice is to die for and you definitely get a real bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I visited Little Piggy's for the first time with my boyfriend and his family. The service here is fantastic! We ordered the UFO Fried Rice with Spam & Kimchi, UFO Fried Rice with Beef, the Bibimbop with Flying Fish Egg and Grilled Korean-Style Beef (aka bulgogi). 

I was really excited to try the UFO Fried Rice, seeing as everyone on Yelp was recommending it. The portion was big, however, I was a bit disappointed in its taste. It didn't have much flavour to it other than an egg and cheese taste - nothing special. My boyfriend's mom got the bibimbop. At first we were shocked at how big the stone bowl was when they carried it out, but when they set it down, the portion was actually very little. She's a small Asian lady, and even that wasn't enough to fill her!

All our meals came with refillable side dishes and soup. The side dishes were good, but the soup had such an odd taste. None of us liked it.

I had high hopes for this restaurant, and am slightly disappointed. I am, however, willing to give it another shot because the KBBQ looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time with my sister a couple months ago and we were very disappointed. First of all, when we entered the waitress asked how many people and directed us to a table without a grill, but didn't ask us if we wanted BBQ or not so I had to tell her myself that we wanted BBQ. Looking at the meat options, it looked reasonably priced as there seemed to be a lot of meat in the photo or the size of the meat looked hefty. To our surprise the $34 beef only had 3 slices that were about 5 inches long each (but looked bigger in the pic) and the $22 pork belly was only 5 3-inch long thick slices (but the pic showed 9 slices). We both love and eat a lot of meat so this was not enough even for only one of us, so it's pretty expensive. There were side dishes and a lot of vegetables to make a lettuce wrap except we didn't even get a lot of meat to begin with. The Korean beef flavour was good (that's for the extra star) but the pork wasn't seasoned so it tasted bland. They grilled the meat for us but no other interaction like \"how is the food so far?\" was made. When we were finished, they just walked back and forth without interaction until we called one of them for the bill. We left literally feeling hangry, as it was expensive and not filling or satisfying. I don't see either of us coming back here, or if we do, probably not for the bbq. I'd rather go to an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, cheaper and more flavour."}
{"text":"Great food! I wish they still had their table cooking combos. The meat is marinated nicely and they also aren't thick cuts unlike some KBBQ places that I've gone to. Although, a more ventilated system would be great. :)"}
{"text":"I initially bookmarked this place after seeing Antonio Park (owner of park resto/food network) went there a couple months ago on Instagram. Despite the yelp score, we went anyways after seeing the \"innovative\" menu they had on their website.
-Location: pretty nice, in the heart of TO's Korea Town
-Service: nothing to rave about
-Food: Rice cakes were pretty good, octopus was fine too (not too overcooked), side dishes and meat were average
- Ambiance: not too loud, but I didn't like the fact that the place was not ventilated. After we got out, our clothes smelled of burnt meat fat. I don't remember this happening at other Korean bbq's

Wouldn't go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Delicious, thick pork belly and great side dishes! A really cool Korean restaurant. Great service too!"}
{"text":"New decor. Very good environment. Lots of side dishes. But! The bbq sauces were very odd. They don't have the typical Korean bbq sauce~ sweet and savoury. The sauces at little piggy's are very salty. Doesn't go well with the meat. 

If you are okay with no bbq, then this place is good."}
{"text":"I haven't been on Bloor Street in a while, so when I was here yesterday I noticed that Little Piggy's now has a location on Bloor Street. I thought this is great, so much closer to home. The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated. It was spacious and comfortable. Their menu was nicely done too, I thought it was very creative and fun. We ordered drinks. I ordered the Grapefruit Aid without alcohol while my friend and my boyfriend ordered the Grapefruit Aid with Soju - a bottle to share. I have to say the drink was really, really good. I am definitely in love with the drink. The food was really good too. The side dishes was good as well. I liked the tofu side dishes the most. 
We didn't order Korean BBQ, but I did notice that other tables had them and the cook top is different from other Korean restaurants that I have been too. The cook tops for the Korean BBQ looked like a regular large round plate, and you can grill the meat on it - kind of like a wireless grill. Definitely much better than the traditional Korean BBQ grills where it takes up most of the table. 
In fact, if you pay cash you get free ice cream with your meal - it says this on your bill. 
Overall, really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service here. I would definitely come back and recommend others to try too. The location is also great, right in the Annex."}
{"text":"A friend had her bday dinner at the restaurant.  A few of us go there early and luckily, it was before the rush at 7 pm. Although we took long time for dinner, they didn't rush us.  We waited for the rest of the friends to arrive before we ordered our food.  To my surprise, our orders arrived so quickly. 

We ordered a variety of stuff including beef ribs, UFO fried rice, and the grilled beef / chicken to name a few.  I ordered the hazelnut beef which the waiter warned that some may find the smell to be overpowering.  But when I had the first bite, I liked it with a hint of hazelnut.  It was not strong at all.  

My friends also enjoyed their dishes as well. The only thing that need to do better is give us the bill faster.  We were waiting for at least 15 minutes for the bill while there was a long line up front. Also, we were a party of 6 and they merged  table of 2 with their regular BBQ tables.  Since the tables were side by side, they lined it up on the side where the utensil drawer was located. We had to split the tables to gain access to the utensils."}
{"text":"One of the more eastern Ktown Korean restos, aka closer to UofT... Yes, that extra 5 mins of walking factors into my rating XD

It is fairly \"new\", so the venue is quite clean and modern-looking. The menu is not spectacularly different from all the other Korean restos nearby, but definitely better than the Korean establishments further downtown. The actual menu booklet is really pretty though, like a magazine lol.

They have BBQ here as well as the usual single dish options. I got their \"bibimbob\" - nothing special about the portion size or quality. They do have some cool/unique dishes, like the UFO Fried Rice. They also serve alcohol and ice cream here.

Food 3.5/5 - a few unique dishes, nothing too special in terms of flavor or presentation
Value 3/5 - slightly more expensive than other Ktown restaurants if you keep walking west
Service 4/5 - fine
Venue 5/5 - clean, modern, spacious enough (large groups are ok)"}
{"text":"There are lots of better Korean BBQ restaurants in North York and Markham area. Its North York place is much much better. Price is high, food was ok but nothing special, service was bad. Atmosphere was smoky, so it was hard to stay long. I'd visit North York one again, not this one."}
{"text":"This is the first fine korean bbq at downtown area. Great interior and every service is fantastic. If you want to try korean bbq in downtown area, you should go right now. And also milk honey ice cream. You will experience whole new world!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new place given the seeming hype around the restaurant.

Walked in there was a small wait.  However, what was really puzzling was that there were 3-4 unclean tables left for at least 20 mins (since we arrived) and they weren't cleared.  Had they done this they would've been able to seat everyone who was waiting at the door in line.  Little frustrating to see this and others who were waiting were commenting the same.

When we finally got seated we ordered right away and got the mixed BBQ combo for two.  At about $40 for this I had expected 3-4 pieces of each meat for this.  When we arrived no explanation on which meat was what and also we only got two pieces of each meat.  Very expensive given the other kbbq options in the area.  

Another note was with all the side dishes provided, what was a huge miss was having no kimchi.  Really surprised that a Korean restaurant doesn't have this staple side dish.  

Finally, the trays served as plates seemed very odd.  First I've ever seen, and honestly felt as if we were in the army eating off a cafeteria tray.

No soft serve ice cream available as machine wasn't operational.  

Overall okay food, more upscale then your regular kbbq restaurant, but can likely find a better experience down the street for better value.  Likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ! Recommend the pork belly, tofu stew, and UFO fried rice!"}
{"text":"Amazing food here. We have been three times now and we are never disappointed. We have ordered the corn pizza, jap chae, bulgogi, short ribs, UFO rice and a few other meat dishes. We have not done the cooking at the table part because the food is amazing. We crave this place once a week!!!"}
{"text":"The food looks appetizing but it was extremely bland. I ordered a beef and egg bibimbap and the menu's description of it as \"plain\" was an understatement. All I could taste was oil. The beef was not marinated or flavoured unlike most of the beef and egg bibimbap I've had from other places. The spicy sauce that came on the side somewhat saved my meal. The barbecue was also overpriced. You'd pay at least $35 for two people without it being a buffet. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"We walked in to this restaurant today to celebrate our Valentine's day. We only waited a little bit for our table. As soon as we are inside, we can feel the smoke is very strong though it's smells good. We saw the waiters delivering foods for other tables and they all look delicious and well made. Even the raw bbq beef, they look well seasoned and has a nice cut. Right up to the moment when I'm starting looking at the nice pictured menu, the fire alarm ringed. It's the first time I hear fire alarm in the public place rather than in my condo. It is VERY LOUD and unbearable. I soon decided to leave since I don't want to hurt my 2 year-old son's hearing. When we cross the tables we discovered there is a client does not know how to cook at all and their grill is all black and meats are burned. I guess it's better for the servers to be more attentive for all the grills in order to prevent such accident happen in a bbq restaurant. After we left, we saw fire trucks coming and all guests are evacuated. I will go to their Thornhill location next time!"}
{"text":"This place is the closest I've come to real kbbq downtown, and I've been craving it desperately since moving here from Korea. The wait staff were phenomenal and helpful and the combo set we got was delicious.  

The induction heating method was also really great and as another reviewer mentioned meant we got to leave without the smell all over our clothes. This place is a bit pricier but well worth it. I strongly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This place has really good kbbq, but it's very expensive!! I ordered the korean style beef and korean style pork and it ended up being nearly $50! I came with 2 other friends and we ended up having to order more because we were still hungry

The pork was definitely a lot tastier than the beef but both were good. The alien fried rice was fine... but nothing special. It tasted like something I could've easily made at home for a fraction of the price

The side dishes were pretty good, especially the (potato?) pancakes and the salads. Our meal came with a bunch of side dishes but I feel like it still wasn't enough to fill us up.

I would say come to this place if you want to try some authentic korean bbq. The meat tastes good, but the only problem is that it's expensive - especially for the amount of meat that they give you. If you're super hungry and/or trying to save money, I'd say go for a $20-25 all you can eat KBBQ place instead."}
{"text":"This is the best place for BBQ items. Meat was tender, juicy and flavourful.

Downside a bit pricy for amount of meat.

Side dishes were plentiful and had a great variety. Service was fast.

Down side was that since we ordered the BBQ, it came with 2 rice and bean paste soups. Those came really slow to the point that the meat was already cooked and
 burning and our other dishes came already.

We had to ask about the rice and once the rice came, they actually billed us on the rice bowls. Definately remember to check your bills carefully.

Restaurant was super busy when we arrived only at 6pm. I liked how in order to get a table we had to write our names on the sheet of paper. Beats standing and waiting to get asked for a number and eyeballing people who comes before and after you. 

Would come back to try new dishes and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"VENTILATION - this is a key thing you need to think about when opening a BBQ joint. We ordered a bunch of food and drinks, it was was all high-quality and delicious. The service was prompt, friendly, attentive. The space has a nice feel. The presentation is great. 
.....BUT we won't go back unless they install an HVAC system. This was summer, with the front windows all open and a fan going - imagine in winter?! No thanks."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come to this place knowing its reputation uptown. Honestly...the food was ok. Nothing special compared to its competitors in the area. 

The service was extremely unprofessional and one waiter kept on dropping plates on the ground and making a mess. 

We weren't finished with our meal and the waiter kept asking us if he can take this/that away, then after a few minutes he brought us the bill - his gesture was basically telling us to get out. On their receipt it says \"Pay with cash and receive a free ice cream.\" When we asked for our ice cream, the waitress said it's all sold out and takes another half an hour to remake. Obviously we couldn't wait that long since they're already kicking us out but an apology would be nice.

UFO rice is cute and unique but if you're looking to come here for only the rice, I much suggest you to go across the street to Aka Teppan."}
{"text":"Stars as follows:

+1 authentic Korean BBQ tabletop cooking, including the little drawer for chopsticks and spoons, proper grills, serving dishes
+1 the meat and sauce taste are better than average. Not the best but similar to stuff I've had in Seoul
+1 the staff will help you cook, which is great if you're inexperienced or lazy. Of course you can cook everything yourself if you enjoy that, but it's also nice to have someone serve you perfectly grilled meats while you have a conversation
+1 creative and customizable menu with things like steamed eggs, cheese on everything, pages of meats to grill

Overall it's a solid place I'd come back again. Went on a weekday during dinner and it was mostly full but no wait time needed. Everything was good for the price ($30+ per person) but I wasn't blown away either, so it's 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Recommend Korean-style beef and seafood pancake. Pork belly was a bit plain and thick. Plum juice was too sweet. The service was great, they'll simply take care of everything."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials! From 11am to 4pm, there are a few dishes are are cheaper than usual for lunch. My friends and I all ordered a meal from the lunch special menu. I decided to get the Don Katsu. One of my friends was deciding between two meals and asked the waiter for his opinion and what he thought tasted better. He was very shy, but very kind and helpful! It didn't take long for the food to come and the side dishes were very unique and different compared to other Korean restaurants. Some of the side dishes include: fish cakes, pasta, spicy cucumbers, and Korean pancakes. There is a slide-out drawer on the side of the table which is where all the eating utensils are held. The sauce on the Don Katsu tasted amazing! The salad on the side was also very good, but I thought it was a bit strange that they used ketchup with mayonnaise instead of salad dressing. The portion was quite big and was extremely filling. The store also played lots of K-pop songs, mostly new songs that came out within the past year. The place was rather empty as my friends and I came at a very odd time. The store claimed to have wifi, but it didn't work for some reason. The service was incredible, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was soothing, the place was just great! If you're looking for a new and unique Korean restaurant to eat at, Little Piggy's will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Fast. Delicious. Great service. Wifi. Very new and clean. Excellent menu. Considerate portions. 

Went here after work with a friend for a quick bite. We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered and the food came out almost immediately. Staff were very attentive that we were not Korean and even offered us forks and an additional bowl of rice. We got the tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) and korean style grilled beef which came with a bowl of rice and soup. We also got complementary banchan: kimchi, bean curd sheets, cucumbers and some beans. It was delicious. Both the beef and the rice cakes came on a hot plate which made it more delicious! The beef was sauteed with some sliced onions and the rice cakes also came with some fish cakes and cabbages. 

It was really delicious! We were also going to order their special ice cream with the honeycomb but decided to get it next time instead. 

Would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and will definitely come back to try more of their unique items such as the UFO fried rice!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come this place but left super disappointed. I ordered their \"korean styled beef\" which was not worth $45. The grill was really cool but it wasn't hot enough. They put a ton of meat on it so it just like steaming on the grill. The meat wasn't super tender but it wasn't tough either. I just can't justify the price for it.
Also my boyfriend and i got 2 drinks, blue lemon and grapefruit. The grapefruit reminded me of cough syrup. The other one reminded me of a 7/11 slushy. We also got the tteokbokki with cheese. That stayed hot for like 5 mins and then everything got hard. 

The service was alright, they were on their phones alot. IMO they should have gave us the banchan, tteokbokki, soups, then meat. But they gave us the soup and tteokbokki when we were half done the meat. 
The total was $95 without tips... not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The WORST Korean food ever in Toronto

went there with my girlfriend, I got pork bone soup and my girlfriend got bibimbop with fish roe,

first of all, bibimbop was super blend didn't taste like anything but MAYO, it was basically white rice, a bit of fish roes, some veggies and lots of mayo, and it was over 10$. if you get a bowl of white rice and put some mayo on it, it will taste exactly the same as the bibimbap they serve for 10$, no doubt.

secondly, pork bone soup didn't have much meat, and it was a bit more expensive compared to other restaurant's in Ktown. the worst part was that the meat wasn't cooked long enough then it was hard to take the meat out of bones, I got frustrated and stopped eating it at one point. broth was alright tho.

lastly, the side-dishes were pretty blend and didn't have much to eat, Kimchi was blend. there was some stir-fried celery which was the worst of 4 side-dishes we got, it was inedibly  bad, we put it away after one bite. if they'd decided not to cook the celery and just served it fresh, would've been much better.

I know it is a K-bbq restaurant, I never tried k-bbq there but based on other dishes we got, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be much different(it almost seems like their chef doesn't have any basic understanding of food)

I really hate going to a restaurant that serves bad food. it's an insult.

I love Korean food and I know what good Korean food is,
Worried about non-korean people try Korean food for the first time at this restaurant and get a wrong idea about Korean food.

It is totally embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've sampled a lot of Korean barbecue in my day, but it's generally been of the all-you-can-eat variety. I was surprised, then, that Little Piggy's was charging all-you-can-eat prices but offering a limited amount of meat.

Nevertheless, we opted for the \"Mix BBQ Combo\" option, which comes with pork belly, garlic pork, and Korean-style beef.

In true Korean style, the meat arrived shortly after accompanied by a whole raft of oddball side dishes. We didn't receive any kind of explanation for what anything was, which was especially frustrating because there were a bunch of sides I'd never seen or tried before. (Including a tasty mushroom-oriented plate.)

We also weren't provided with any utensils, so I had to get up and ask for some from a nearby waiter. (We discovered later that utensils are actually contained in a drawer attached to the table, though again, we weren't told about this. I only figured it out by noticing somebody at a nearby table pulling out a drawer.)

Anyway, the meat was fine, I guess. The pork belly was tasty enough, although it contained a few overly fatty chunks that were basically inedible (ie they were super chewy). There was nothing on the table that was *bad* but nothing blew us away, either.

After we finished the meal, we naturally assumed we'd be presented with the bill. 45 minutes later it became clear I'd have to again get up, find a waiter, and ask for the cheque.

Though I wasn't terribly impressed by my meal at Little Piggy's, I will admit their non-barbecue options, which I saw people at other tables eating, looked pretty darn tasty. (And all those items are quite reasonably priced, too.)"}
{"text":"Such a great KBBQ spot in Toronto! Their tables heat up, please pay attention cuz that is so fucking cool. Their meats are well marinated. Little pricier but quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Had the pork bone soup with house-made kimchi - broth was nice and flavourful and sour. Pork was very tender. Good banchan. Funny drinks in lightbulbs."}
{"text":"Amazing place for Korean BBQ. We tried both the Korean style beef and pork and loved it. Even though it was really busy, the staff was friendly and supportive."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting Little Piggy's restaurant, and I had to make sure to try it more than once to place my review on it. The difference in the experience and hospitality of both attempts really questioned my ability to rate this restaurant. Nonetheless, this is what I think of it.

Little Piggy's is what I would consider as a slightly modernized KBBQ joint. From the decor to the food presentation, it is different from other KBBQ location you would find in K-town. The space is slightly more upscaled, with lengthy halls and dining tables that doubles as an inductive stove top, allowing the waiter to start the BBQ by simply placing the grill pan on the table. It definitely felt more modern and intuitive, which displays it's trendiness in an area that's dominated by traditional restaurants.

The BBQ is priced slightly aggressively, with one person possibly spending upwards of $30 in a group setting. The food, however, was delicious. The meat presented were of good quality, and did not seem heavily frozen or tainted of colour. The selection of BBQ bapsang (or side dishes) were plenty and expected. We ordered a selection of pork belly, bibimbap, beef flank, and an assortment of pancakes. The food tasted great with the selection of dipping sauce offered to each person in an lunch-looking tray.

However, the reason this restaurant could not achieve a higher rating was due to the inconsistency in service. Often times, food would be given to the incorrect person, water would not be filled, and fulfilling simple requests would be forgotten. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not completely full, it was difficult to justify the lack of service in this context. 

Overall, Litte Piggy's restaurant is a great group restaurant that offers good quality food at a premium price. Just make sure you grab napkins from your nearest table instead of asking for some..."}
{"text":"This small KBBQ place suffers from an identity crisis.  Is it a BBQ place or a snack shop/drinking hole?  They try to serve up KBBQ alongside snack foods like Tteok-bokki and katsus which is NEVER done in Korea.  Why not just focus on one thing and do a good job?  

I've tried their Thornhill location several times before so I was a little skeptical (due to witnessing some hygienic issues in the kitchen) but decided to give this location a try after a long day with a toddler at the ROM.  

Their induction cooking table top is definitely one of the coolest thing I've seen and a welcome feature especially when you're got a curious 4 yr old at the table.  Despite the induction technology table tops, the issue with smoke has not been resolved as the management claims on their menu.  

We ordered Samgyup-sal and marinaded pork and paid additional $2 per bowl for rice & a small Doenjang-jigae although the menu said it was $2 dollars for 2 bowls of rice and a small jigae.  Anyways, I was not in the mood to argue with the absent-minded all male staff so I let it slide.  

They serve up next to no banchan with your meal and the lettuce wraps and condiments are barely enough for 3 wraps.  We had to ask them for utensils and the waiter just pointed at the pull-out drawer that's supposedly built into the tables.  Well, excuse me for not knowing where to find my own eating tools.  So, to sum it up, the service here is terrible.  The food was mediocre with the exception of marinated pork which my daughter loved.  

One thing that really put me off was the attitude of the staff.  Most of them are indifferent (whether you're Korean or not doesn't seem to have much to do with it as I spoke to them both in Korean and English) and terrible at keeping on top of needs of their patrons.  We were seated next to a large group of non-Korean patrons when we first sat down and when they finished their meals and left, the 2 waiters that were cleaning the table were cursing at the b*tches that left a mess.  I could hardly believe my ears as they swore at the then-departed patrons in plain Korean as I sat their giving them a clearly disapproving look. 

I would like to suggest to the owners about seriously reconsidering their hiring policies at this location and actually hire staff that can and are willing to work for their wages."}
{"text":"Little piggy's is my favourite korean bbq restaurant in the downtown area. The pork belly, marinated pork, and beef are all really good. The best part is all of the banchan they give you. It's a little pricey but it satisfies my kbbq cravings."}
{"text":"Service was prompt. Both gamjatang and the UFO fried rice tasted really good. Seafood pancake was just ok. We will still come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight with my cousin. We got to the restaurant around 6:45 and were promptly seated.  While looking through the menu, they asked us if it was our first time there and explained the menu to us. They mentioned that sides were included in what we ordered and we would not need more than that. 

We shared a kimchi pancake (delicious and fairly large), and both got the spicy pork bibimap (like other reviewers - I found this to be good but nothing special).  While the food was good,  I wouldn't come back here simply because of the awful service. After we were served our food, and the waiters forgot about our table completely. No one asked if we needed more water, if we were finished our meals or if we wanted our bill. While other tables came and left, we were ignored. 
 
After roughly an hour of being ignored and avoided we went to the front counter to pay, without any acknowledgment of the food left or if we enjoyed our visit.  While I was pretty excited about this place at first,  I'm sure there is far far better."}
{"text":"Looks like they recently renovated the place, according to my friends who've been to this location before. Very friendly staff  and the food was delicious too. Didn't order any drinks but quite a bit of food. The UFO rice was good but the BBQ is the main reason people come here and it was as I expected....Pretty decent. 

One caveat would be that due to the poor ventilation the whole place becomes smokey and full of aroma....So you'll be walking out of there smelling like Korean BBQ and it will stick to your clothes/jacket"}
{"text":"Disappointed with limited menu items as well as food quality comparing to the North York location. Ordered seafood pancake and Kalbi. Pancake was dry with batter clump and Kalbi was way over cooked. I mean, come on, being so close to Korean town the quality is just way below par"}
{"text":"We came to check this place out and order a dinner set. It came with three different kinds of meat, lettuce, two different kinds of salad and a soup. The set also came with a lot of side dishes. Rice had to be ordered separately. 

One of the three meats was a little bland and needed to be dipped in sauce for more flavour but the other two tasted great. The meat was soft and the flavour was good. 

The service was great. The servers would come around and help us cook the food and cut them up too. They were really nice. 

The atmosphere and design of the restaurant was nice. 
I would come again. 

I would recommend you to check this place out if you're craving some Korean food. 

You should also try the blue lemonade. I loved it!"}
{"text":"We were initially told that we have to wait 40 mins, they said they are going to call us. After waiting for an hour, without receiving any calls, we went back and asked..... the waiter told us because they are so busy, we have to wait another 15 mins.... ok then we waited for another 20 mins but still no calls, we went back and asked again. We were told that we have to wait for an other 30 minutes as they forgot to call us....what is the problem of these waiters?!!!!! Excuse me?!!!!!! They are so irresponsible and ignorant!!!!!! Hello?!!!!! For korean food, i will strongly recommend Seoul restaurant or even Sunrise restaurant! They are close by but are more reliant!!! We ended up eating its neighbor Thai Basil! Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner.  We ordered 2 orders of the samgyupsal and 2 orders of the garlic pork.  The garlic pork definitely had more flavour and was very tender.  The samgyupsal was average tasting.  We also ordered the steamed egg and pork bone soup.  The tables were very small, so everything was squished in and so were the people.  Language is a slight barrier, but if you speak Korean, it makes it a much more smooth ordering experience.  We had checked in on the Yelp app as there was a 'free ice cream', except when we went to order it the waitress told us \"we don't have any ice cream, it is coming from Korea\".  We weren't sure if that was believable, but we weren't going to argue.  My friends have been to the other location and said that the atmosphere, and quality of food is better.  I would give that location a shot before I visit this location again...and hopefully the ice cream arrives from Korea by then."}
{"text":"I went here today with my friend because I've always wanted to try Korean BBQ. Overall, my experience was pretty good and the food was AMAZING. The staff was really kind and helped us with using the BBQ. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The tteokbokki was tiny. There were literally 8 pieces in my dish. It looked nothing like the pictures and was missing the fish cake as well. I didn't pay $1 per piece of tteokbokki. 

We had the UFO rice because it looked really good. Although it was filling, it really didn't have a strong flavour to it other than a residual salty tone. 

Man I was so bummed out by this because everything looked so promising. 

I will post another update once I've tried their Korean BBQ and flavoured soju as I recognize those are two things they're more well known for."}
{"text":"Average Korean place that accommodates groups well. Dropped by for a weekend dinner for 8 and noticed the rest of the space was filled with 3-4 other large parties. The place is primarily known for their BBQ so I was surprised to see that there were no exhaust fans anywhere near the tables. Suffice to say, it can get a pretty smokey! 

My friends shared the Pork Belly combo as it needed a minimum of two orders. It looked big and they were pretty full and happy with it after. Opting for a smaller meal, I got the UFO Fried Rice with Pork and Cheese ($15) - definitely a novelty dish as it was filling and fun, but the ingredients and flavour were kinda bland for the price. The pitcher of Grapefruit Soju ($20) was really tasty and generous though and they definitely didn't skimp on the alcohol! Also came with these adorable shot glasses. Overall, not my fav Korean place but not a bad choice for parties since they take reservations and serve a good drink."}
{"text":"We visited Little Piggy's recently for a company gathering. Considering the neighbourhood, the prices seemed a bit outrageous initially, but in the end we were quite satisfied. Most items are very shareable and you would probably have the best experience if you come here in a group of 4-6 people. 

We tried the beef BBQ for 3 (~$70) which came with a plethora of sides. Realistically this was more than enough meat for 5 people to share. In addition we ordered the seafood pancake, LA style ribs and bibimbap. As a big bibimbap fan I was left a bit disappointed by the one served here, but most of the other dishes/ sides were spot on. The LA style short ribs were well seasoned and just saucy enough without making a mess, and the seafood pancake had just the right balance. In addition the service, cleanliness and chic ambiance made for an overall pleasant experience. 

Overall, this isn't the typical Bloor St. Korean join you're used to, but that may actually be a good thing for once."}
{"text":"3.5
Ordered the Mix BBQ Combo bc of the variety. I liked how they gave us free dwenjangjjigae with the bap. Quality wise, everything was pretty good compared to uptown. However, quantity in terms of how much meat we got for our order was so little... Was left still hungry after our meal. Also, the induction pad was nice but our clothes still ended up getting smelly lol

Prob would come back here for the jjigaes instead of the BBQ for the location and price, since it's closer than Christie!"}
{"text":"First I want to give kudos for the great service. Usually Korean restaurants have terrible service, but Little Piggy's had excellent service.

We had the pork table bbq combo for two ($40). Came with 3 different cuts of pork including pork belly. The meat seasoning and marinade was well done. Delicious stuff. The induction tabletop is crazy. Tech is pretty cool. 

Also had the seafood pancake ($10). Probably the best pancake I ever had. Could have ate another of these, and it was quite large. Big chunks of seafood and a spicy sauce to dip in.

Yelp Check in for the free soft serve ice cream. It was really good.

We did smell after eating here, not sure how people came out not smelling like meat. 

Overall, I could probably eat this everyday."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ and awesome service. Side dishes are the best. Also clean and upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little place, reminds me of Korean BBQ in Seoul.  Quality of the meat is good and waiters are nice.  This restaurant is more westernized aka more space between the tables, which is really nice when there's a lot of steam and smoke! I wish the beef dishes weren't quite so expensive but I'd come back as a nice casual restaurant to have kbbq!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the Grilled Korean style beef with rice. The flavour was rich with enough sauce to use for my rice. The seaweed soup tasted like it was made with homemade broth. Service was extremely fast. For starters we received spicy cucumber, pickled cucumbers, kimchi and fish cake. Would definitely come back to try the Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is legit the best korean restaurant I have ever been to. Make sure you try UFO fried rice with kimchi. I would come back to toronto to just eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a modern and hip Korean place which is rare to see anyone in their 40s or 50s. Many tables were occupied by university students. 

Their hot tea was really good that I kept on drinking it. They gave us a thermos teapot which was nice of them. Service is quick. Even though there's a line up out the door on a Friday night, they didn't kick us out like some Chinese restaurants do. It was a nice feeling. 

Their 5 side dishes were great as I liked their pickled cucumber the best! I had a soft tofu soup which was not too spicy and the tofu was definitely soft and not the square ones that one can buy at the supermarket. My friend had the pork bone soup and she enjoyed it very much. 

Their menu also features Korean BBQ and certain fusion dishes with cheese. 

This is my second time here and I will definitely be back. Maybe I'll try their BBQ since they teach you how to eat it properly with lettuce leaves. See photo."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. my order was taken quickly and I was served rather fast too, it was tuesday so there were many empty places. I wanted to eat chicken katsu don, they explained me the sauce was not curry but some other so I decided to risk because I usually get a curry sauce with katsu but apparently, it's not a must :) the sauce was a bit too vinegary for my taste and bits of chicken tasted older, like when I keep meat in my fridge for a bit longer than I should. I didn't complain, it's not a habit of mine specially since I was alone. I wasn't interested in appetizers or soup but the salad/veggies were delicious. I also managed to eat a smaller part of rice since there was so much meat. I packed some for later because the portion was rather big :) the price was okay considering the size of portion and location. I would return but not to eat the same, I want to try UFO rice although its a bit much (plus +$3 to add cheese :/ ) but it looks interesting, or the bap to go. 

edit: my stomach hurts really bad tonight and I haven't really eaten anything else so it must be the old meat. I am really sorry, if the meat had been good I would have given 4/5"}
{"text":"I went here again to try this place again. We ordered different marination of pork steaks and gosh, were they thick and fresh! Food came out relatively quickly and we were off to the grill. It's great to know we get unlimited refills of the lettuce that you're suppose to eat with when you're eating Korean barbecue. The waiters also come around to help cut the meat for us to enjoy. Great service! 

They gave us a complimentary steamed egg that was on the house! The egg was a good compliment to the barbecue heavy meal! There were plenty of side dishes and unlimited refills too so you can always add more toppings to your barbecued pork/beef lettuce wrap with some of the side dishes too. 

The only downfall to the experience is the ventilation in the restaurant. The moment we stepped in the restaurant, the place was filled with smoke and by the time you step out of the restaurant, you smell like barbecued meat yourself too!"}
{"text":"Nice beef short rib soup. Will definitely come back next time! The seafood pancakes also test great."}
{"text":"Great find in Spadina, the kalbi is great and the servings are good as well! The ambiance and the washroom is clean, a little bit pricey but my family and I loved it here! We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for the KBBQ
The design of the store is nice, the staffs are friendly and the place is clean.

They changed the menu the second time i came, so they no longer have the BBQ sets. You have to order each meat individually now. It comes with some vegetables and side dishes. Rice has to be ordered separately. The quality of the meat is good. The type of KBBQ grill they have is unique. The server cooked the meat for us.

Service: Excellent
Food: Good
Price: on the pricier side for kbbq"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for sure. But everything was really good. The side dishes were great as well. A friend told me in order to judge a Korean restaurant, their side dishes will be the thing to watch first. Overall a great experience, however the service can be a little faster."}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing, I strongly suggest the bibimbap, the corn pancake, and the glass noodles, those were my absolute favourites!  I went here for my birthday on Friday, and it really made my birthday meal special!  A few complaints I have though are the slow service and the awkward chopsticks.  I understand that the restaurant is really busy, but we found ourselves waiting a looot for simply things like water.  As well, the chopsticks were cool, but they were so skinny, they were hard to hold and manage, unlike the usual bamboo ones.  Besides those two criticisms, this restaurant was awesome!  Absolutely delicious and very different :) , I would happily go back to Little Piggy again!  Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Went because followed them on Instagram and the food looks amazing. There was a line up even on a weekday evening but service was good and fast. Interesting way to eat Korean food I haven't tried before where you put the meat and some of the side dishes onto a lettuce and wrap it to eat. But the BBQ was waaaay too overprice for what we got so although the food was good, I am not going back due to the value alone. The UFO fried rice thing was very tasty though. Try for novelty but perhaps not all the time due to value."}
{"text":"Fantastic and modern Korean BBQ place with quality meat, awesome seafood pancake and friendly service. Came here Saturday night and had to wait about ten minutes to get seated. It might be longer for others. It's a bit pricier than other places but it's worth checking out at least once. Try also ordering their unique UFO fried rice!"}
{"text":"They have the more advance cooking plates for kbbq.  Pretty cool. Only disappointing thing for me was my dinner party didn't get to do the cooking ourselves whereas other diners got to.  The server kept cooking for us, which us weird as I'm used to going kbbq and found it all by ourselves. It's a more fun dining experience that way.  Could it be because I brought two Caucasians to try kbbq for the first time? Hmmm.....  

The food was not bad but I'd prefer other places for kbbq."}
