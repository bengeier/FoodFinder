{"text":"My brother-in-law suggested this place to me after he stumbled upon it shopping in the Mekong Plaza.  He told me about plates they served and how delicious it was.  we were both in the general area so i suggested we go and eat there...he didn't hesitate...  Finding this place may be a tad bit difficult because its not your typical store front location.  Follow the signs or ask around and you'll be fine.  Its located inside a plaza and is similar to the mall food court eating type experience (if anyone else is there. lots of seats. it was pretty empty but it was a tuesday afternoon) so just be ready for that.    Wholly Plate #7 Two-Item BBQ Combo (except tuna) is what i ordered. Meat: Skewered BBQ Pork & Liempo (pork belly-\"house special\") Side: Macaroni (standard). Rice Included. *ordered a side of atchara (perfect combo with the BBQ) and of course extra scoop of rice. All of it was soooo good...thats all i really gotta say about that...with my nieces so dessert is unavoidable so we got a couple orders of turon w/scoop of ice cream ($1.00 each item)...delicious...  On a side note i couldn't help but acknowledge the owner for running to the store to get bananas for the turon as they just ran out.  they didnt have to do that but to see my nieces devour it is always worth the wait...or course be patient as the meat is made to order...did i mention its worth the wait?"}
{"text":"We just got back from grocery shopping at Mekong plaza and discovered a new restaurant called Wholly Grill.  The food is delicious.  We had the bbq chicken and grilled garlic shrimp with sides of macaroni salad and grilled eggplant.  The portions are generous and reasonably priced.  Great homestyle cooking.!  We'll definitely eat there again on our next shopping trip."}
{"text":"We got the Adobo. Was okay but my pork was full of little bones and hardly any meat. I bit on my first bite and a sharp bone stabbed my gum. It was painful. I don't think I'll ever get it again."}
{"text":"This place is fan-tastic! Their staff is really friendly and are always wanting to please. We have tried the bangus, pork belly and pork skewers, cassava cake, and papaya salad. It was all delicious. Filipino food has never looked and tasted so good. The presentation was appetizing and this place looked clean compared to some of the other filipino restaurants I've been to in the valley. This is the best. Depending on the day, it can be slow to get your food. Usually I don't like waiting for long, but it makes me so happy to see that they are busy. I wish they could open up a real restaurant and expand their menu. Everything I've tried from here is spot on."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lechon plate with the sweet cucumber. I was kinda sad...my rice was warmer than the entree. And the flavor was not as bold as I imagined it would have been. Also had the pork skewer....amazing flavor I must say! Next time im gonna order the BBQ Beef Plate. The halo-halo was delicious as always. Im gonna come as often as I can so I can start knockin down everything on the menu...one by one."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Great portions, great prices, great service, great food.  Defintiely plan on going back again and again!  Fortunately, we live close by.  Be sure to try the fried banana rolls with ice cream for dessert.  It's heaven!  My husband and I tried the pork belly and bbq pork.  Both excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and must say that I enjoy the food very much. Most of the main dishes here are grilled. If you don't mind a little fat then the pork belly dish is grilled to a mouth watering perfection. Whenever I'm in town, I make an effort to visit this fantastic place."}
{"text":"I happened to go on a day of a Filipino Festival in the mall. Long lines of customers at Wholly Grill, most of whom were speaking Tagalog. So this place seems pretty authentic. The grilled skewers were fine. I was particularly hungry that afternoon. The service was chaotic, but I think it was due to the festival. Food was coming out slowly and there wasn't any order to the line once I ordered. Others received food ahead of me. I'm sure they'll be more consistent on non-festival days. The festival was fun to watch."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back. The bbq pork skewers had a great sauce and were tender. The price was about the same as a drive through fast food joint, but much healthier and tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly and the pickled salad was refreshing."}
{"text":"We met Chona who is the owner of the restaurant.  The food brings back memories back to Angeles City where we have an abundance of grill joints that sell grilled pork bellies and chicken.  Her special sauce makes her grilled food really tasty."}
{"text":"My gf n I have been here three times already bc the food is so good. It is just like homemade so try it out f"}
{"text":"This gem tucked away in the Mekong Plaza has everything from daily filipino specials like chicken  papaya soup to pancit that bring me back home to Hawaii.  But the standout is their delectably savory grilled meats that can please even the finickiest of eaters, like my hubby!  Our fave is the grilled chicken closely followed by the pork belly and beef.  Of course, you've gotta accompany this with macaroni salad (mixed plate anyone?) or papaya salad for the full experience. Be patient, all the meats are cooked to order, and so worth it. The owners, Chona and Ivan, are always welcoming and friendly to customers."}
{"text":"I would actually go for 2 1/2 stars...The Lechon (special on Saturdays) tasted like it was premade. The \"crispy\" part of the pork belly was almost gooey. The meat itself tasted good, although better with some Kikkoman shoyu. The pancit was good, but heavy on the vegetables. The gem was the shanghai lumpias. For $2.00, you get 5 mini (half) lumpias, that are GREAT! They give you a sweet and sour sauce on the side, which I don't think goes well with it. Being a true Filipino, I like my lumpia with a vinegar sauce. If you ask the cashier, for a vinegar sauce, they have a white vinegar, with some onions in it. It was ok, better then then the sweet and sour...Overall, a descent find..."}
{"text":"Cowabunga Dudes:  This place ROCKS. Had the pork skewers - best damn fillipino food this side of Manila. Will definitly go back. Can't wait to try the chicken.  Rock On,  Moi."}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly, and I love the food. If you aren't sure what to get, the BBQ chicken is a good start. You might consider the salmon steak as well."}
{"text":"Parabok Taste - 3/5 good but Jollibee parabok is better Value - 2/5 not full Service - 3/5 i have been waiting for food 20minutes on Sunday 2pm  Liempo Taste - 4/5 good Value - 4/5 it comes with rice and side of vegetables  Service - 3/5"}
{"text":"My husband and i went there for lunch .This place have a really great food . I order  pork liempo,chicken bbq,macaroni salad and milkshake .,.the pork liempo is pretty good and also the macaroni salad ,the chicken bbq is okay . My husband like the pork liempo  and the macaroni salad  and also there beef bbq .  And there milkshake is so delicious ."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've dined at this place.  It used to be okay, but now seem to have slid down the scale a little bit.  First, the Kare-Kare lacked meat and looked like it was sitting in a warmer for several hours as the meat was somewhat soggy.  Same with the Adobo.  The grilled Liempo was pretty good, so was the lumpia.  Service was a bit slow compared to most asian eateries.  As for the Halo-Halo desert, not only did it not have much ingredients to it, but they added mango.  In case they forgot Halo-Halo should never have Mango bits to it.  The milk and acidic fruit just don't blend well.  To top it off, there were too many flies in the food court.  Overall, not a pleasant experience, and definitely not going back in the near future."}
{"text":"I live thirty minutes away, but definitely worth the drive. The cashier was so nice and she wore gloves to protect her hands!! I bet she has the softest most supple hands in all of Mesa!!"}
{"text":"Pretty close to mom's cooking. Great place. The Chicken Adobo was excellent. Will be back in the future. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Since the first time we tried the Liempo and the lechon, we were hooked!  We are from Las Vegas and every time we come to Arizona, we have to go and eat at Wholly Grill.  The pork liempo and their lechon (on Saturdays and Sundays) are awesome!  On the 22nd, we took our entire family here to have lunch before we shop for our ingredients at Mekong market.  Everybody loved what they ordered.  My brother in law loves their chicken adobo, my husband super loved their chicken bbq and my niece loves the dinuguan that she ordered.  The rest of the family ordered the liempo like me.    We also loved Ate Chona, she owns the place and cooks everything.  She is one sweet lady that takes pride on her cooking.  We have ordered party trays here and have never been disappointed.  Their food takes a little longer to come out because she cooks them fresh.  You cannot rush perfection -- this is coming from a person that loves to cook and takes pride on the food that I make as well.  Last Monday, we ordered a tray of Lechon Kawali (it would have been lechon but Ate Chona did not have fresh pork belly anymore) for our Noche Buena. Another top notch dish from Wholly Grill.  It was totally delish!!  The tray went too quick and was disappointed that I wouldn't have any left over for the lechon paksiw.  I always recommend Wholly Grill to all my friends who wants to visit Arizona.    A must try place if you are craving or wants to try good Filipino dish ... you won't be sorry! We totally love this place!  I wish we have a place in Vegas that is comparable to this."}
{"text":"Great little place.  I ordered the grilled pork and Chris D. got the pork belly. They were both delish. I think I liked the belly best.  They lady behind the counter was very helpful in explaining things (our first time with Filipino food). She also gave us some watermelon to go with our lunch. As we were leaving I asked about the special pork they had that day. She gave us a taste and it was melt in your mouth good.  We actually had leftovers, I made pork fried rice with the next day.  Thank you for the outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Giod food good price quick service authentic filipino.  Will come back again. Highly recommended. so happy we found this place. Located inside mekong oriental supermarket"}
{"text":"Good Filipino mall food. Decently priced. The chicken adobo was not the best. It was bland and flavorless. The bbq chicken was excellent however!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Filipino friend. Ordered the Lechon (pork), blood stew, and the pancit guisado. I love them!!! i love the Lechon especially, crispy skin and juicy meat.  Overall, very good filipino food!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, and each time, the food has been really good.  It's a nice change-up from the other Filipino restaurants in AZ.  I usually order the grilled pork belly, grilled beef, rice and the eggplant condiment they have.  They cooked the grilled items when you order them, so it's a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I came here only to eat Halo Halo. It met my expectations! Very good, inexpensive Halo Halo for $5. It is not the typical authentic Halo Halo I've had in the past (because they put cereal on the top of this one) but it was still very good. Also, I didn't notice flan in mine (or maybe I devoured it too quick to notice lol).   Overall it's a nice addition to Mekong plaza and one of the few Filipino restaurants in Arizona. Next time I'll try one of their ice candy or entrees."}
{"text":"This was my first time there, I was looking for a quick to go place for lunch and I figure that since it was in a food court, it would be fast- but no I waited longer than I wanted and there was only one person in front of me. I ordered the bbq steak over rice, the food was good, the portion was ok. It was my first time having Filipino food and the cashier did try her best to explain their dishes to me. I just think this place would be better as a sit down resturant, not inside a food court. I also though that $11, was pretty pricey for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"After having read the reviews, I knew we had to give this place a try.  The husband and I had dinner here and are already planning on eating at the Wholly Grill regularly.  The service was superb.  The owner was very friendly and made sure we tried a sample of the house specials.  She was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of.  We had the BBQ chicken and the Liempo (BBQ pork belly) and both were excellent.  Our dishes took a few minutes as they don't cook the meal until you order it, but it was worth the wait.  We added an order of lumpai shanghai (at three pieces for $1, who can turn that down?) and the lumpai was also very good and very fresh.   We had the Cassava cake for dessert and it was a great ending to a delicious meal.  They are now offering longsilog and tosilog for breakfast too.  Prices are reasonable and portions are big.  Definitely try this place out - you will love it!"}
{"text":"Tried the celebrated pork belly.  Tasty, especially with the dipping sauce, not bad at all, but imho not nearly as good as the roast pig next door in the Mekong Palace.  The accompanying vegetable, broccoli, was way undercooked, almost raw.  Some of the other dishes that I saw  - shrimp with noodles and rice - looked interesting.  2 1/2 rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"This is the coolest little place! Yummy lumpia, great prices, reminds me of the Porter Square Asian Food Court in Boston... Who could argue?!"}
{"text":"The food is okay and cold. They forgot my Oder =( I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get served. It was mind boggling because the girl in the behind the counter didn't noticed that my food wasn't serve yet and she is the one who took my money and I paid for my food. She had a very passive look and overall I am disappointed with the service and food.  The staff needs to revamp their customer service and communication skills. That's why I had to give Wholly Grill one star. I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  Me and my wife go there a lot because my wife is from the philippines.  Today I went there and got the Liempo and I'm pretty disappointed.  Most of the pieces of pork were hard and chewy.  Most of the time the liempo is very tender and delicious but this time it was pretty hard to eat.  Even my wife spit out the food when she took a bite.  You need to do better Wholly Grill."}
{"text":"It is not a 100 percent turo turo area they cook some of their dishes, I ordered crispy pata it was so good and meaty but unlike California crispypata where they serve the whole feet so you can nibble on it they only serve the meaty part somewhat sliced so you can tare it out. The sales person was very nice I would go here again prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"As a Filipino in Phoenix it's hard to find Filipino restaurants in Phoenix especially Tagalog Filipino cooking. Most Filipinos in Phoenix are illocano or Visayan and there really isn't alot of Filipino restaurants to try so when my mom and I saw a banner outside of Mekong Plaza of a Filipino grill that just opened, I made sure that the next time I found myself at Mekong I'd stop and try it out. Anywho, Wholly Grill is owned by a Cebuana, and they specialize in grilling hence the name. There are usually two things I'll try out at a Filipino restaurant and that is their barbeque and the house special. In this case it was the pork barbeque and the Liempo (grilled pork belly). Chona the owner was pulling out all the stops to get people to try out her place hence the 4 stars coz she was giving out samples. The barbeque was not sweet which was good and not too saucy! I think that's what people are not big fans of and that's sugar sweet filipino food. The Liempo was not fatty nor salty and with the 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad (pinoy style with the raisins) along with two pork bbq sticks for around $10 it wasn't a bad deal. I just wish she had sago or Halo-Halo. But it's not bad, and if I need a Filipino fix I'll stop by at Wholly Grill! you should too!"}
{"text":"This place is good too I love their Lenchon kawali its my favorite place to eat too check this place out they are friendly too."}
{"text":"Wholly Grill is no longer alone in the Mekong Plaza food court, as the other eateries finally opened during the Moon Festival. But the food is just as delicious as before and the service just as friendly. I had an overpowering craving for pancit palabok today and made the trek to Mesa to try Wholly Grill's version of it. It was wonderfully authentic: rice noodles generously bathed in a thick savory annatto-hued shrimp sauce, with tender shrimp, crunchy bits of crushed chicharon (pork rinds) and flakes of tinapa (smoked fish) -- Filipino comfort food like no other! Of course I had to pair it with gulaman at sago, a popular Filipino cold drink sweetened with panocha brown sugar and with cubes of gulaman (flavored agar) and tapioca balls.  The meal reminded me of the scene in the Disney movie Ratatouille, where the food critic took a bite of the food and was immediately transported to his mother's table when he was a child, eating her delicious cooking. That was pretty much like my experience today."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant here on a few occasions while in the food court area I finally decided to try out this place mainly due to curiosity. This happens to be one of the few Filipino restaurants in the Phoenix area so I was excited to try it out.  I was not too sure what to get so for starters I decided to try out the BBQ Chicken. It came with steamed rice and I opted to get the steamed broccoli + carrots. The BBQ Chicken was very tasty and I would definitely go back to have that again. They also had a few items on their menu that I was curious about as well - mainly the garlic shrimp and some of the fish options.  I'm glad that there is a Filipino restaurant within the food court of Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"Drove from the West side of PHX, to check this place out. We don't regret driving far! We ordered the beef bbq and liempo bbq meal. We also ordered the halo halo and ordered lumpia and turon for to go. Angel was really nice, she let us know that the lechon they make is actually on weekends and it's a whole day thing - which I thought was really cool. Going to order it next time we head there. The eggplant salad was good too, it's a side you can choose and it went well with the liempo bbq. They make the food as you order it and it can take a while. Worth the wait! As opposed to other places that already have it out, not so fresh. Try this place out, I guarantee you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Located at a little shopping center. My family and I yelped this place because we couldnt get enough of eating Filipino food despite living in Los Angeles. Let  me tell you...this place is worth checking out. I ordered the Lechon plate which is really good. The pork skin was crispy and lechon wasn't oily. The BBQ beef was amazing, the beef was tender and flavorful. I highly recommend this place. The staff were very nice and food is amazing"}
{"text":"Located in the food court at MeKong Plaza, this is a great place for authentic and very tasty Filipino food.  We ordered the BBQ chicken plate and the bangus (fried whitefish) as well as the palabok that we ate within the food court.  Absolutely fantastic!  We live in Prescott Valley and there isn't a decent Asian restaurant within 50 miles.  It was a real treat to eat Filipino food again and this restaurant won't disappoint!  Atmosphere isn't that great, but the people who work there are terrific and the food is wonderful.  We got the dinuguan to go and it was also terrific."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend. Food is good. I will stop in again when the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Excellent Filipino BBQ at this place.  I was visiting Phoenix for work and needed to satisfy my Pinoy craving and this place hit the spot.  I'm not sure what the owner's name was, but she made sure I was taken care.  The liempo here is one of the best I've ever had so make sure to order that.  The place is located in a shopping plaza so keep that in mind when you're looking for it."}
{"text":"I went to Wholly Grill last month based on the Yelp reviews. I've been to the Philippines a couple of times and have eaten all the native dishes. I had two barbeque pork skewers with the rice, carrots and brocoli. I normally don't like to review a place after one visit, but realistically, I don't find myself too excited to go back and give them another try.  The BBQ was meh. The yellowing brocoli and carrots were heavily drenched in pepper, not very appetizing."}
{"text":"Plus: Serving sizes are large and the staff is friendly. They bring your food to your table after you have ordered at the counter.  Cons: Service is very slow. I got the BBQ beef ($7.75). The rice was gummy, the beef was tough flank steak, the sauce was a super sweet brown syrup, the mac salad was bland. Overall, the food had no taste at all except for the super sweet sauce. No taste of BBQ anywhere in this dish.  Seating is in the food court and the noise is pretty bad. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"If you didn't know they were here, you might miss them.  They are in the Mekong Plaza, but are not visible from the outside.  You have to go through the first set of doors that take you to the market, then go down the hallway at the north end.  Back in there is a food court, and Wholly Grill is there.  This place specializes in Filipino food.  There aren't a lot of Filipino places in Phoenix, and even fewer on the east side.  Of the ones I've tried this was as good as any of them, and had bigger portions.  One huge complaint I have with many of them is the microscopic portions (that often include bone and fat).  Here the portion was reasonable.  They have a decent variety of dishes here.  The ones we tried were very tasty.  Not as good as my wife makes (by a long shot), but tasty.  The ladies behind the counter were friendly.    I wouldn't journey here just to have dinner.  But if we're at Mekong (or nearby) and feel like some food I definitely can see returning."}
{"text":"The food that I ordered was so-so.  However, the staff was definitely not friendly during the time that I went in the evening.  I don't know if the staff is different throughout the day, so sorry if there IS nice staff.  Anyway, the cashier was very rude and had a dull personality.  She also completely messed up my order.  My friend actually recommended the place, so I had high hopes...  maybe I just went on a bad day, but I am definitely not going back here, life's too short to deal with rude people, especially when you PAY them."}
{"text":"These are the friendliest people I've ever encountered!  They are extremely nice, and try to customize their dishes to our needs.  The food taste awesome, and the serving portions aren't bad, either (trust me, I eat a lot)!   Wholly Grill is a place I look forward to visiting every time I happen to be by Mekong Palace.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I used to come here alot. Loved the liempo and the skewers. That was then, around 1 and half year ago. Then for some reason the freshness just vanished out of thin air. Maybe the old cook quit or something but the freshness is just not there.   Wish I could give a better review but the fact that it's first impression has not lasted over the months. I wish they can fins a better cook.   P.S their sweets are still good."}
{"text":"The restaurants in the Mekong Plaza are all worth at least one try. The Wholly Grill is one that is worth a second, third and fourth try. We needed something good and cheap for dinner, and are all about supporting local businesses when we can, so we meandered over to the Plaza to see what the food court had to offer. We opted for Wholly Grill and were not disappointed!   I got the grilled pork belly and my partner went for the pork skewers. I couldn't tell you which one I liked more. The skewers were tender and juicy, and my partner loved the eggplant salad she got with it. They reminded me of the awesome street food you find in that part of the world. My pork belly was crispy on the outside, and the perfect texture on the inside. If not cooked right, pork belly can be chewy, rubbery or like trying to gnaw on a piece of fat. This was not like that at all. I was full and kept eating. Every time I thought I was done, I saw another piece of meat on my plate and had to have it.   The staff was super friendly. When asked what she recommended, she giggled and said the pork belly, like she wasn't expecting a ginger, white girl to go with her suggestion. There are a few more things on the menu I'd like to try, if I can get around ordering something other than the pork belly. Which I'm already craving again."}
{"text":"Always great to try new foods, loved the halo halo ice cream except the ingredients at the bottom of the drink were different. I also ordered lumpia. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"If you want good Filipino Bbq I would recommend this place. It seems that their hours is very inconsistent so I would call before hand. Price is decent. They are located inside Mekong market place."}
{"text":"I was bragging to my boy how awesome Filipino food is...so I ordered the Pancit Guisado and Adobo. The Adobo was flavorless. The Pancit was overloaded with celery. Cheap prices, yes, but quality of food is disappointing."}
{"text":"This isn't real filipino food! They didn't even use the correct noodles when making pancit!  There's no flavor either!  Waste of my money,  never again!"}
{"text":"I have one word for you, son.  Porkbellies.  Specifically, GRILLED Porkbellies.  With a side of rice, a side of pickled eggplant, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of cucumbers.  It doesn't get much better than this.  (crunch, crunch, crunch)"}
{"text":"I read the reviews. I had a craving for Flip food...so I dragged poor unsuspecting hubby along.  It's located inside the mall around the corner from the nail polish store. *swoons* Nail polish AND Flip food? Momma's come home. Too bad that nail polish is more expensive than that food!  Anyway, I was slightly put off by it not being a restaurant, but I got over it once I had that pork adobo goodness in my mouth...and all that RICE! The BBQ chicken. O.M.G. TO DIE FOR!  Their lumpia shanghai was good and 3 for $1 - I can easily see people totes forking out mega money to get that full feeling!  I met Chona and she was a total sweetheart. Note to self: add her on FB. :)  I really enjoyed the cassava cake and atchara.  I can't wait to bring mommy here when we're in AZ."}
{"text":"I will come back every Saturday and Sunday every once in awhile just to get the lechon not the lechon kawale because my mom makes hers a lot better along with our Turon that has my sisters and my favorite included: langka. Which we found out that theirs does not include it,just sweet banana which was really good it's just kind of a bummer when you know the Turon that we make obviously has it.  I felt bad for my mom since she thought the guy standing in the front could speak any dialect from the Philippines to find out he's from Hawaii, so none of the things she was saying to him in Tagalog went right over his head.  Anyways back to food! ? Pancit palabok-C- Lechon kawale-C Lechon-A++++"}
{"text":"Hungry for good BBQ meats? try this place. Good BBQ chicken and pork and beef and the pork belly is tasty too.  Did not try the adobo, but if in the area again, I just might! Good Halo halo!! Portions a bit small if you ask me, and nobody has!!!! hahahah"}
{"text":"If you need a taste of home but too busy/lazy to make it look no further. This place is pretty delicious! I can only speak for the pinakbet and lechon plate. The lechon was moist but the skin was still crispy and the pinakbet was awesome. The side I chose was the eggplant salad and it had an intense sour flavor but it was awesome!! I definitely will return to try more options but I'll have to remember that they are closed on Mondays. I'm a full happy camper! This place is most definitely one of the better Filipino food options in the valley but with the food court atmosphere."}
{"text":"BEST pork skewers...BUT 1. Whats with the lettuce? All it does is make whatever I ordered taste like lettuce. And 2. Please do something about those flies buzzing about indoors. Its the reason I prefer to go when I order there"}
{"text":"The woman behind the counter is friendly and always eager to see me. She let me sample their lechon (slight crunchiness to it). So far I've only ordered their pancit and lumpia and on the dessert side, their turon and halo halo. All have been cooked correctly and have the expected taste. Will return to curb Filipino food cravings."}
{"text":"Back to the roots is what I say.  NOTHING will beat moms cooking but this place is definately a soul soothing gem hidden in the Mekong plaza.  Charming food and friendly places but its definately something for the adventurous palate if you'd not accustomed to the cuisine of the Phillippines.  Try the Bangus (marinated fish dish) served ith rice and Eggplant.  Exotic, tasty and stays in the box.  If you're looking for more americanized anything in the BBQ region but if you'd like to get a taste of real Filipino food the Sinagang with the fish sauce is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Been here once with some friends and their food is okay.  Being from San Francisco/Union City area it id hard to find any asian food in Az let alone Filipino food that will really blow your mind.  They have a good menu and decent portions. Ordered the lechon last time and it was okay.  It was too greasy and it made me not want to finish my plate.   I believe my bf got the liempo but I could make better ones myself.  The one thing that was really good was their melon drink."}
{"text":"First time here... lechon and pancit delicouseeee will c ome back.... yummy got my tummy happy"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time today and must say it was the best experience I've ever had eating Filipino food in Arizona. Not only is the food spectacular (I had the Lechon plate), but the people are as friendly as ever! I'd been waiting to find a place in the metro Phoenix valley that serves tasty Filipino food with integrity and a positive attitude. I am happy to say that I have found it. Pinakamasarap na pagkain sa valley for sure!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I shared the Mini Pata plate (#8). This is a classic and extremely popular Filipino dish. The portion size was plenty for the two of us. The pig trotter was perfectly prepared with the combination of four textures, including the crispy and crunchy skin, the tender and succulent meat, the sticky and yummy fat, and the gelatinous tendon. We are awarding 4 stars as a result of how well prepared this dish was from a small restaurant located in a food court at a shopping mall. The service is prompt and courteous and the prices are reasonable for a mall restaurant.  On our second visit my girlfriend and I tried the Lechon plate (#13). This is a standard Filipino dish served at all special occasions. The portion size was plenty for the two of us. I can confidently say that the food was as good as you would find at a similar type of restaurant in the Philippines. Most if not all Asian cultures have some version of roast pig and this is my favorite among all of them. They way that Filipinos prepare roast pig results in the most crispy, crunchy skin along with meat that is still succulent and this restaurant achieves that very well.  This will certainly continue to be one of our regular dining spots at Mekong Plaza.  Photo design by Billie Z."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a lunch date as we were in the area.  Other than the Mekong Restaurant, we haven't eaten at any of the other places.  We walked around the whole Mekong Plaza and this was our last stop.  My husband saw skewered meat, so we decided to eat here.  It turns out that this is Filipino food, which I haven't eaten in a long time.   I think I've only had Filipino food a few times in the past 15 years.  I got the Daing na Bangus.  This is a fried boneless, marinated and pan fried fish.  Can't remember what kind of fish it was, but it was not Tilapia.   It came with 2 hefty scoops of rice, a sweet and sour cucumber salad and a small bed of lettuce.  This was yummy and the fish was boneless and fairly tender.  My husband also had a little of mine and he liked it.  This was for $8.  My husband got Skewed BBQ Pork.  That came with the 2 skewers of meat, 2 large scoops of rice, a bed of lettuce and sweet and sour cucumber salad.  He did not like the sweet and sour salad and gave it to me.  I liked this much better than Kimchi, which they didn't have since that's Korean.  This was for $6.50  We also ordered an order of Lumpia, which these are tiny eggrolls.  Our order had 5 for $2.  We also had 2 Cokes.  Total came to $19.99, which was fine.  Service was good.  The guy was very nice and comes from the Philippines.  He's been here 12 years.  The tables are a bit on the need to replace the tops and we didn't get napkins, but when we asked, he gave them to us.    All in all, a good experience and good food."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Service not so good. The guy that helped us was not too friendly kind of had an attitude. They did not have a few items that we asked ordered. My brother swore he has eaten pepper steak at another Filipino restaurant while this guy insisted that no one sells pepper steak. Well tell you what Halo Halo has it... My neice had the pancit it was kind of overcooked and had way too much celery in it.  That is something I will never order again if I happen to be on this side of town.  I had the sinigang I really enjoyed that. 5.00 for a small bowl. Lumpia was veri tiny smaller than my pinky finger. This side was good if you just need to sample it. Lechon is not bad at all.  This is the plate to get if you are craving some good eats. I wish they would serve more.  So basically the prices are a bit high for the servings.  Flavors are all there but just feels like there could be a little more to it.  Maybe its the open seating in a food court atmosphere.  Good luck with finding a clean table.  I just dont think I would load up a bunch of family just to come and eat here."}
{"text":"4/7/10  Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!  Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].  The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and \"dirty\" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities (\"colleges\" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!  Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying \"I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!\"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!  Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, with hearty filling dishes.  Now to be honest, I am not an expert on Filipino cuisine, so all I can say is what my taste buds tell me, but the lumpia was very good, perfectly crispy on the outside, with flavorful meat on the inside.  The chicken adobo was also good, and reminiscent of soy sauce marinated chicken that my mom used to make.  They serve lechon on certain days, and I would definitely like to try some of that when I am in the mood for slow roasted pork!"}
{"text":"Having the Lechon Plate...Cebu Style slow roasted pork with crispy skin.. two skeweeed BBQ pork...and of course. . Having a Halo- Halo.."}
{"text":"When I need my  Filipino food fix this is one of two places I go. Crispy pata is what I get and sisig."}
{"text":"Second time within two months of eating at Wholly Grill. Found it for the first time during the Filipino Festival at Mekong. Daughter spent a month in Bacolod, Negros Occidental, Philippines this summer so she was craving some of her favorites. BBQ pork on a stick was excellent. Huge serving of rice and your choice of sides. We ordered the green papaya salad, but they were out, so we got the daikon/carrot salad. Also ordered lumpia...fresh and made to order. Got a turon which was sweet and yummy and also fresh and hot. They did not have lechon on a weekday, but had lechon kawale...was interesting, being deep fried, but not nearly as tasty as their regular lechon they have on the weekends. Halo halo was much better than the one we had at Jollibee's on Oahu, but admittedly not as good as the ones she had in Bacolod. Overall, great service, cooked to order food and tasty. Brought along a friend who never had Filipino food and she's now a fan."}
{"text":"Food is just OK, service is very slow and menu items are limited. There is actually not much real Filipino food on the menu. Centers around grilled items (chicken, beef, etc.) that has obviously been cooked before hand and reheated. I wouldn't eat here again unless it was the only restaurant in Mekong Plaza that was open and I was VERY hungry."}
{"text":"Had the Lechon plate Sunday. It was the best pork I've ever eaten. I will return to try the entire menu and so should you."}
{"text":"So to begin, I want to give 4 stars because the lady forgot my calimansi juice, and gave us spoons when we really needed knives. However, I think yelp should be about how good the food is, and wow, I ordered a lechon plate and it was really excellent. I have ordered lechon from other places and it's usually hit or miss, the skin would be too chewy, but not today! It was so crispy and flavorful. I loved it!   I finally got my calimansi juice, and the first sip was great but it's too sweet. I had to water it down to get it to where I like it. I still give 5 stars for the lechon though!"}
{"text":"I was down in Arizona for a dental seminar. After a long day,, My friends and I decided to hit the mall(Mekong Plaza), Luckily, We ran into a newly opened Filipino/Hawaiian Resto. This place is a \"MUST\" try.  The food was EXCELLENT, YUMMY and the servings were HUGE!!!!  But most of all \"GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE\"  I can only wish we have something like this kind of \"Mom and Pop\" resto in northern cali.  We had a great experience and I \"HIGHLY\" recommend it.  I promise you will keep coming back for more.  :-)"}
{"text":"We stopped by Mekong Plaza yesterday to shop at the market and eat at Boca 7 (which is very good). In the back of the mall, in the nearly empty food court, is a brand new Filipino-Hawaiian place called Wholly Grill. Since we had already eaten we bought some items to-go to try for dinner. Considering we ate the food hours later and microwaved it, everything was good. What made it exceptional was the amount of food we got for the price. Also, the lady running it is from Cebu, and the style of cooking there differs from the Manila style most Phoenix Filipino restaurants employ (this according to my wife who was born in Manila but spent her adult life in Cebu). I hope this place will thrive. Its great to have an inexpensive Filipino place in town that can cook Cebuano dishes!"}
{"text":"I heart Wholly Grill!   Try the BBQ pork skewers with rice and you won't be disappointed! The pork is flavored perfectly and the portions are super filling. It's the only dish I've tried and it's hard to break away from it because it's so delicious!   The only sad thing is that they are only open for a short time on Sundays. To me, it's more of a dinner time option so it would be nice to have it after 5 but at least they're open conveniently throughout the week and on Saturday.   They are located in an Asian marketplace called Mekong Plaza and there are lots of little neat shops to go in after grubbing. Be prepared for busyness on the weekends but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Better sinigang compared to Nanay's. Liempo is to die for! They are nice as well ! Would recommend"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food here yet, but the halo halo is indeed a new favorite of mine. When I ever do try the food, expect an updated review! I believe it ran about $5 a drink but the drink is pretty large, it has mango, various jellies, banana, coconut, flan at the bottom and then it's covered in shaved ice, milk and condensed milk and topped of with a large scoop of sweet ube (purple yam) ice cream. It's pretty large actually, we had just finished lunch and it was okay for 3 people to share as a dessert. Service was quite good, friendly people and I don't find the prices to be too high. I definitely will be back for more halo halo and I hope to try their other dishes!  By the way, it's not a stand alone restaurant, it's inside of the Mekong Plaza and stands food court style."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch one day while trying to eat healthy. Not too bad but it did take a while."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The owners Ivan and Chona were very personable and the samples were wonderful, we ended up getting a good selection of BBQ Chicken, BBQ Pork Belly, and Shrimp and Beef Skewers. We also had the banana rolls with ice cream,   Go in the side door and not the main door, unless you love the smell of fish. The smell is not coming from Wholly Grill, but it is in the market."}
{"text":"I was in the area and starving for lunch so I popped in and tried their chicken adobo and lumpia and both were good and the adobo was very filling.  Finally I have found another Filipino place I can eat at again since my old fav closed."}
{"text":"My picky children aged 7 and 11 loved the food. The youngest had the BBQ beef and gave it two thumbs up. My oldest said the eggrolls were the best he has ever had. He also had a great flan for dessert. Prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly. This is in the mall with the Mekong supermarket so you can enjoy a great meal with your shopping trip. I had the bbq beef with the eggplant side (excellent). Even the macaroni salad is a cut above anything I've had before -- not too heavy like most. My wife had the pork skewers with the papaya salad side -- it was a perfect accompaniment to the grilled pork. We shared a strawberry banana shake, which thankfully was not too sweet.  It is a very rare occasion when everyone in the family likes a restaurant, but this one fit the bill."}
{"text":"This place is so cool.  Food is made to order, so it's nice and fresh.  The menu was pretty large and I was disappointed that I couldn't try any of the meat dishes (oh, Lenten Fridays!).  I mean, the pork belly looked PHENOM.  I decided to order the grilled mahi-mahi.  Any of the entrees come with rice and one side, so I chose the eggplant salad.  (It was either that or the papaya salad.  That's an awesome option to have, right?)    I was starving when I got there, so even though I probably only had to wait for 15 minutes, I felt like I was waiting for an eternity!  The mahi-mahi had a nice garlicy flavor to it, so when you combined it with the white rice + vinegar/soy sauce, it was too good.  The eggplant salad was different than anything I've ever had and it added a nice saltiness to the dish.    Another Filipino food win!"}
{"text":"Halo Halo is good! Bungus is good! Lechon is good! Everything I've had here hit the spot for your Filipino craving!"}
{"text":"Eh well I been wanting to go here but honestly not too impressed. Ordered the palabok but even tho it was huge it was just OK. The halo halo was good but don't measure up to the other Filipino places I've been."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quick short ordered Filipino food that is fast and cheap? This is the place for you. I ordered several dishes from their menu and by far the best dish I like is the Crispy Pata and Inihaw dish, oh my oh so yummy! It's more of an asian food court set up so if you need something you have to get back in line. But i didn't mind, overall i give it a 3 out of 5. ;) Hopefully the service gets a little better."}
{"text":"A great simple place for a Filipino restaurant in the desert! The owner and the people are awesome and so as the food!.."}
{"text":"This place is good. Food taste fresh and clean. I ordered the pork belly or pork liempo, Mac salad, and a beef dish... All were excellent and a good balance. We also had the green tea milkshake....and the milkshake took nearly 10 minutes, but it's the best shake I have ever ever had by far... Anyways the other Filipino restraunt that gets attention in this area is Halo Halo which is a full restraunt but not even close to taste... I still give wholly grill 5 stars, the only thing they could do better is have full restraunt instead of being in a food court. Wholly grill should have more location; that would be awesome!!! Better than the food in Phil!!!    Let the Truth be told"}
{"text":"Yes I'm a fan! I rarely get to eat Filipino staple foods such as monggo (mung beans) with pork. I loved it. We went there for lunch with two other fellows and a Mexican friend - she liked the pork liempo. I finished my generous-portion plate of pork chop, rice and monggo.   Also recommending egg roll (lumpia shanghai). I have also tried their ready-to-eat dried fish (called jeprox). What I did not like is the eggplant salad, kinda too cold and not seasoned.  Overall experience was great, can't wait to have another lunch sometime at Wholly Grill"}
{"text":"Wholly Grill is located inside the Mekong Plaza so you won't see a sign outside. This is a good place to satisfy one's Pinoy food craving, but it's nothing to write home about. I got the BBQ Chicken plate. The chicken was tender and tasty. The rice wasn't all that great - I wish there was an option for garlic rice. I would pay extra for good garlic rice. I also got the calamansi juice and that was awesome! Sweet and tart as I remembered it! It reminded me of the mirienda time we had when I was growing up. There isn't a huge selection, but a good number of choices. I heard they now have Tocilog and Longsilog, but it was neither on the menu or the wall when I checked. I'd like to try those next."}
{"text":"We came here for a convention. We ordered our food--  Pork bbq, Lechon Kawali, BBQ Beef, Grilled Shrimp, Pork Liempo, Pancit and 3 orders of Calamansi juice.  The staff were all very friendly and nice.  We also got the shanghai lumpia and oh, the ice candies!! I tried the avocado-banana ( my first time to try) unbelievably creamy and tasty! My group had mango and ube-macapuno.   The owner personally prepped, cooked and served us.  Very good service!!   Would recommend for those who crave for comfort food or just want to simply diversify their palate."}
