{"text":"This is my favourite place ever!! I always order the medium ribs and naan. The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly! You can stay in or take out.   The manager is great and will always make you feel at home. I order from here probably 3-4 times a month!!  You will not be disappointed if you come here!!"}
{"text":"Our office used to be close to Tiffin, now it's a bit more of a drive, but a wonderful treat.  The Okra is amazing, and it's so nice to always have a delicious veggie option.  The staff are friendly and remember my order.  If you're looking somewhere to try, this is a good place to start!"}
{"text":"OK if you are in a rush, but Prime Tandoor on Edmonton Trail and Mirchi on 12 Ave SW (not the 2nd Ave location) blow this place out of the water. Nonetheless you will not be disappointed, just not overwhelmed. I do not see the fuss over the roti machine. I never saw one in any establishment when visiting India or Pakistan. It is the only place in town that has a meat curry schedule, at least that I know of. I do not eat Indian nor Chinese buffets so I will not comment other than buffets loose the essence of why you are eating ethnic food to begin with, especially Chinese buffets where nothing is authentic."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place.  The decor is boring cafeteria style and the hard metal chairs are uncomfortable unless you have a large, well-padded posterior. The food however, is delicious.  There's always vegetarian choices and I love how they have the food arranged in the serving area.  The veggie food is farther away from the server and closest to the customer.  The meat food is closer to the server.  Because of this arrangement, when the server dishes out the meat food there's no chance of it dribbling into the vegetarian food.  As a 27 year vegetarian I really, really appreciate this.  The prices here are very reasonable and the staff is very pleasant."}
{"text":"I tagged along with a friend who was picking up a bunch of beef ribs for a party, so that's all I've had a chance to try from here.  (We also picked up an order of fried cassava to snack on while we ran our errands--very tasty, and somehow not as filling as fries would have been!)  The hot ribs have a slow, subtle burn that makes you think you're totally fine until you realize your lips are numb.  Awesome."}
{"text":"I would give this place 100000 stars. I missed it every day living in BC. I actually moved back just for the samosas....haha. Ok, maybe not but I probably would. It's crazy good value, the curries are all amazing but the butter chicken is the best! The chicken samosas are legendary, so much that I can't bring myself to order the beef or veggie which are probably also great. The ribs? Have we talked about the ribs??!! Ribtastic. I'd go as far as the best I've had. And the best you will. Don't be crazy, start with medium!! Oh, the mogo is also great. Oh! And don't forget the roti!!! Ok, just go eat there. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Located across the street from Short Pants Plaza (I kid you not), this is kind of like my personal vegetarian fast-food heaven.  At the counter you can select from a variety of combination meals including curries, rice and roti.  Each day the selection of curries varies, but it always includes both vegetarian and meat-based choices.  Behind the counter you can see the roti machine at work- dough is dropped in, spirals through the oven on a mini-conveyor belt, and out pops a fresh roti!  Take your tray of curry, rice and fresh roti out to a table and enjoy!  Oh... in addition to the daily curries there are a few menu items that they'll bring to your table- try the delicious masala mogo (spicy casava fries)."}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given a negative rating. This happened a few months ago, I was driving past this joint and I decided to eat, I was there just by myself. The guy who I encountered was probably the owner or the entitled kid of the owner. I am not sure why he was pleasant to white people and not to me, may he has a general disregard for brown people, anyway, this review is not about his sad pathetic life, rather about their sad pathetic restaurant. Once I got my food, I was told to grab a seat anywhere, but, there was only one table available which would seat about 10 + people, I believe a large party just left as it was evident due to dishes on the table with leftover food, which they never bothered to clean, so I was forced to eat next to dirty dishes and equally dirty table. I asked for napkins and water, I was told that this a self-serving restaurant, which I acknowledged and asked where I can get myself water and tissues, but, I was completely ignored. I finally had a chance to drink a glass of water, this was when I was leaving the restaurant and asked again, a glass of water was provided with a much discomforted reaction, like I asked him for money. Coming for food, subpar or mediocre at best. I can cook better food, any given day, I am not just saying for the sake of saying it, I can cook a mean curry. A lot of reviews seem to be paid or written by the people who never had real Indian food. My advice - Learn customer service (Go to YouTube and search for videos on How to treat your customers)"}
{"text":"If you have some time on your hands I would highly recommend 'The Bird'. Hands down best dish in town."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious authentic food! This has been on my try list for a very long time and finally did it this weekend. No bells and whistles here, just casual service and food from a family owned restaurant. The place is semi cafeteria style where you can order from the front or if with a group of people, then you can seat yourself and they will bring you menus. Being newbies, we were a bit confused coming in so asked to be directed on what to do lol.   After hearing from friends and reading through the reviews, we knew we had to order the spicy beef ribs, chicken samosas, rogan josh (lamb curry), butter chicken, with seasoned rice and naan. I really wanted the roti they are famous for but they were out so we had to settle for the naan... next time! Everything was yummy, I had high expectations for the beef ribs; we ordered them \"hot\" but I would say they were more mild/medium so will get extra hot next time. The lamb curry was actually my favourite, large chucks of tender lamb in a perfectly seasoned sauce.   Prices are reasonable and the portions are good. Lots of large family groups dine here, felt kind of like you were a part of the their family lol. Will return for more."}
{"text":"Buffet style Indian food.  Always has nice flavor though it isn't too spicy (sometimes needs more spice).  You can get the meat curry for ~$9 but get 1/2 meat and 1/2 vegetable.  This is a much more reasonable size entree for lunch.  The meat and vegetable combo is too much food.  My favorites are butter chicken and mixed vegetables."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but very confusing when you have never been here. We ordered fried kababs, chicken mishkaki, and mild ribs.  The fried kababs and chicken mishkaki were both very good, but ribs had no flavour and were very dry."}
{"text":"The Tiffin Curry & Roti House is a great place to try and they actually have AUTHENTIC Indian food.  When you walk in, you'll see the 'roti maker'. I'm positive it's the only one in Calgary. It's this machine that makes rotis. Okay people, I'm brown and I've NEVER seen one in my life! It's really cool! It pops out a roti every 10 seconds or so!  I've had the buffet here and it's pretty good. The vegetables and lentils are nothing fancy - honestly, they're what you would get served if you were eating homemade Indian food. No frills, no bells, just homemade Indian food.  The best thing about this place in my opinion though are the rotis. They are THIN, which is KEY to a properly prepared roti and the owner sells rotis to go! I often stop by and just pick up a couple dozen rotis to go. A little tip for you; if you pick up the frozen rotis, they are cheaper than the non-frozen rotis. There's no way you'll be able to eat a dozen rotis in one sitting, so you may as well get the frozen kind, pop them in your freezer and when you're ready to eat them, just pop them in the microwave or on the stove for a couple of minutes.  MMMMM MMMMMM, happy tummy, happy wallet - life is good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good I've come a few times and the place is full during lunch time. You can order a combo with rice 1 curry and 2 rotis or for a few dollars more you get an extra curry. They serve daal, mixed vegetables, cauliflower and potatoes among other curries. The portion sizes are actually pretty generous.  Although my wish is 3 rotis!  All in all i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the whole city. This is fast food Indian Cuisine and it is done quite impressively. They also have one of the only (if not the only ??) Roti Machine in Calgary.  I live in the SW quadrant of the city, and they are located in the NE. I go out of my way to eat here.   The service is quick & friendly, the food is absolutely delicious. Having a different Buffet style menu each day of the week, with certain staple items every day (like butter chicken). The look of the place is pretty simple. There are tables and chairs, but the feel of the restaurant is mostly take away.  They also deliver!  I'm trying to make this informative for you all, but all I can think while writing this is \"nomnomnom\"."}
{"text":"due to proximity to my office, i have tried this place once.  the only reason tiffin didnt get one star is that they do have a fancy roti making machine. pretty dang impressive.  other than that, the food is pretty sub-average for indian food. knowing that butter chicken is the indian equivalent to sweet & sour chicken balls from chinese takeout joints, it's pretty bland here. unfortunately, i think they use the same base for a lot of their food, and it really lacks flavour/spice.  it's cheap. which is why it's busy. for something actually authentic (according to all my indian colleagues), you're better off trying babakhadaba (sp?) on 17th."}
{"text":"The MOST incredible ribs I've ever tried! Love them medium spice along with the mogo. Lassi is nice along with the choma chicken. The ribs are so incredible that Tiffin is usually my first and last stop when I'm in town :) Have tried to find a place that even comes close and cannot find one. One of my MOST favorite restaurants in the world. LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I do consider myself a fan, and enjoy food done right. I was really excited about this place and wanted to love it but I was disappointed. The methi chicken was really good, but the dal was average and the rice was overcooked and flavourless. The fresh roti, which is what brought me here, was also disappointingly undersalted and lacking flavour. The idea here is awesome (fresh roti with your choice of curries added to rice for a quick lunch combo) but the execution is poor."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Decent food. Nice atmosphere. Good people. This is a 'B Back.'"}
{"text":"The value here is great, the food is fresh and it's really really fast to pop over for a workday lunch.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of African and Indian food but this place was decent.   Good selection not overwhelming and I had the butter chicken with seasoned rice and roti.   Plenty of seating area and food is served quick if you do the lunch combos.   Overall service is good and food is good can't go wrong if your a fan of this type of food."}
{"text":"This Review is close to my heart, I have been going to Tiffin since they opened, and my kids were little, I have been here over a couple hundred times. I have enjoyed Dinners, Lunches, Late afternoon Snacks with friends, families, and even people I don't talk to anymore. The food is terrific, it's East African/East Indian mix, it's the food I mainly grew up with. As you enter, you will see that the curries are ready in warmers, there are usually 6 to 8 to choose from, with plain rice or spiced veggie rice. And topped with rotis. From the time you order and pay is usually a few minutes, super fast. Now Tiffin also has a Main Menu, which consists of African Speciality Dishes and Barbecue. The dishes you must try at tiffin are the BBQ beef ribs, spiced from Mild to Chenzy,...which is super hot! And  Mogo, which is Casava, similar to  Potatoes. Everything is on the main menu are a must to try, my favorite dish is called \"The Bird\" which takes 45 min to make, it's a Cornish Hen, deep fried and sautéed in a peri peri African spicy chili sauce, if you like spice you will love this. This place is a Must on my list to try! And message me if you want to know what else to try!"}
{"text":"If it was possible for me to give a 5 1/2 I would definitely do that! The food was phenomenal and the service was on point! I have lived in Calgary all my life and this is the first time I've experienced the magic of Tiffin... The ribs were heavenly and the mogo (cassava) was to die for.   We had a party of 40 And the service was impeccable! They catered a buffet to us and they did not miss a beat.   If you're looking for authentic East African / Indian cuisine with a street food like flair then Tiffin is going to hit the spot!   If you find yourself in the area and you don't stop by, consider your visit incomplete.   Strong 5 (bordering on 6)!!"}
{"text":"The Roti's are fantastic soft and moist   . i really liked all the curries i tried as well.  I sampled the choma chicken and that is definitely a great dish that i will be going back for"}
{"text":"Tiffin was recommended to me by several friends who spoke highly. And by hearing their praises I finally broke down and decided to visit this place.   Upon entering the place I expected to see something completely different...I was expecting to see a fancy restaurant. But the layout is simplicity itself. Its a similar in layout to any chinese fast food place in a mall.   The menu make up is also a little bit different, there are of course the lunch box combos for people that cant or dont have the time to sit down to eat the food. And the other half of the menu is made up of things that are prepared in the back...restaurant style.  To be honest I have not had a lot of Indian cuisine, however I really liked both the taste and the texture. If it is your first time trying Indian just ask the guy/gal behind the counter for help ordering. I did. And I loved the choice of food that was on my plate. Superb taste!"}
{"text":"The BEST menu item at Tiffin's ( in my opinion anyways) is the medium spiced beef short ribs. They have kept me coming back to Tiffin's for years now. I always pair them with the butter chicken curry (which can be hit and miss which is why i knocked off a star- sometimes perfect, sometimes too runny/watery) and plain rice, and order naan bread for the side. (I just don't care for roti in general) and leave happy with a full belly.   The staff are always pleasant, and there is usually some cute Bollywood movie playing on the TV's. If you're in the area, don't go into the usual China Rose, check out Tiffins ribs!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at the best, but hi, they have been highly rated by the locals, I personally would never go here for thalli, the dal bhajia were good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Good food fast service.  Pricy for the portion size.  Small meal for 5 was $85."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Whenever I am in Calgary I always visit this place. Love the food love the people."}
{"text":"Roti's...ahh...roti's. It's been too long. All I ever seem to get in South Asian restaurants are naan, but the Tiffin Curry & Roti House has saved me. They don't only have roti, but LOTS of roti's thanks to their automated roti making machine.  This restaurant is a cafeteria style Indian restaurant with 3 veg and 3 meat dishes daily. None were spectacular but all were decent. None of the dishes were spicy hot either, so my kids (3 & 7) weren't chugging down their mango lassi's after every bite. I love my chili's but I rarely bring my kids with me to Indian food because they complain that it's too hot.  We got the family meal which was $45 for a large plate of rice, 4 vegetable curries, 4 meat curries, and 12 roti's. It seemed like a good deal. I had a chai with my food as well and it was decent too. They had kulfi on the menu which I really wanted, but they were out.  This is a great place for a quick meal, but as the name suggests, they also have a Tiffin service and do catering. And on my way out, I bought a dozen roti to take home with me for $4.50...I'm so pleased."}
{"text":"This is a casual Indian restaurant that serves African and Indian delicacies. Everything we ordered was delicious the last time I went.   The chutneys that they bring to you are the perfect trifecta of accompanying sauces. Hey give you a spicy red chilli sauce for heat, yoghurt raita to balance that out, and of course my favourite: sweet tangy tamarind sauce which is the brown one.  The ribs were awesome. Sizzling hot melts in your mouth, great texture and fantastic sauce/seasoning. We ordered two plates of medium hot ribs. Initially we ordered one but we had to go for the second. The chicken samosas are awesome. We ordered four.   We decided to go for spicy potato balls and with coconut chutney and two sticks of mishkaki over salad rather than the regular round kebabs and delicious Mogo this time. The service was good, the food was good and the ambiance was comfortably casual."}
{"text":"We stop by here during lunch hour. Minimal menu but reasonably priced lunch. For 1 curry and 1 meat with rotis to go with it is about $7 + GST. I've had chicken and veggie entrees and they've always been pretty good. I recommend for a quick stop on a lunch hour."}
