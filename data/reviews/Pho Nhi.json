{"text":"This restaurant offers one of the best vietnamese dishes in Toronto. Located in the corner of Sheppard and Kennedy, it is convenient and very easy to get to.
The food is amazing, very high quality ingredients as well as great service!
Price is very reasonable and affordable!
Great people, amazing food! 

Will definitely be coming back for more!
Recommend this restaurant to anybody that loves authentic Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places to go for Pho. The service is usually very good and fast, and the food is always great. We always get the House Special Beef Pho - super tasty and always lots of meat. We also love the Beef and Onion vermicelli - so tasty and the meat is very tender. The rice dishes are also very good - we've tried the grilled pork and chicken option and it was amazing. The fresh rolls are a great appetizer (pretty big portion!)

The restaurant is well kept, nice and spacey and clean. Overall, the food is consistently tasty and a great option if you want good, comforting, quick food!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to taste their food.   The place wasn't busy.  I was told where to sit.  Took my seat and no one came.   I  left after 5 minutes.  What ashame.  A young guy was sitting behind me.   Looked like he was ready to go too.   He was there before me.  No service."}
{"text":"This family run restaurant serves one of the best Viet food. Good variety on the menu with generous servings.
They treat you well and with respect.
We ordered 5 items and they were all different (unlike other restaurants where all taste the same with just a slightly different look).
We also ordered the fresh wrap spring-roll which was fresh and tasty, but pretty filling.
Great place and conveniently located."}
{"text":"The soup is not bad. But the odour of beef seems to be a bit strong for me. So I squeezed two pieces of lime to get rid of it. And the soup even tastes better with lime juice. 

However the waitresses seem to be cold. After we sat down for around 10 min, they served us with tea which is not normal in Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Food: 2 out of 5 - not because of the food but mainly because of the HAIR found in it.

Service: 2 out of 5 - girl slams food everywhere. While cleaning a neighbouring booth she constantly makes comments about how messy the last customers were. If you don't like to do your job then don't work there. No need to hear your complaints.

Atmosphere: 3 out of 5 - nothing extravagant. Too many super large booths. 

Pricing: 4 out of 5 - fair pricing. Could be a bit less for the amount of food actually received. 

Enough said!!"}
{"text":"Food is perfect. Bad service. Remember do not order the D5. That coffee milk is worst one I ever had."}
{"text":"Laughable and unfriendly. From food to value to service nothing, sets out to impress. First impress started out good, the restaurant was bright and clean, pretty much went down hill from there on in. First issue came when came time to order, no service what-so-ever. We walked our order to them, after some failed attempts of trying to get some attention, ALL the servers were busy socializing. 

We ordered a small special pho, fried squid, and a tofu mixed veggies with rice. Food came- all i remembered was my amazement of how tiny the calamari portion was for +$6...then came the pho. The issue with growing up eating pho is that you can pretty much pinpoint the problems. It is why I rarely order pho frequently but it is one of the dishes I order besides the rice to gauge my rating upon a Viet restaurant. I ordered a BEEF pho, the broth  neither tasted of beef nor of the typical fragrance of Vietnamese pho. The rare beef was thoroughly cooked through and through, the flavour and seasoning were off. The portion and ratio were good for a small, but hardly redeeming. The worst was my bf's rice; it was good up until he almost finished the plate to find a hair...

The service was, overall, deplorable. From servers that were too consumed with their own conversation to even bother taking orders, to a female worker that sported a constant sour attitude bringing us our food (not utensils). Icing on the cake, as a quick FYI, we told them about the hair and was pretty much interrogated. If you don't want to serve the customers properly, or want them there, why the hell would I want to come back? Mistakes happen but this is too much to be acceptable at any one given time. Safe to say, we didn't tip and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"LOL Found this restaurant because I live nearby. Though it isn't as good as the one I usually go to (at Midland and finch), its pretty good considering Im very picky on pho. The soup is a little salty but passable. 

The only reason I didn't give them a full star is because of the customer service. They're socializing and there's this one girl that has a salty attitude every time I go."}
{"text":"Nice big booth seats and big TV's, one playing CP24, and the other, a movie when we went. Lots of seating.

Came in during dinner hour, but the place wasn't so busy, yet we still had to wait quite some time for our food.

Me and my fiance both got small-sized rice noodle soups. I got a plain one ($5), and he got the rare beef one ($7.25). Serving size is pretty good, more noodles than I expected. Nice thin noodles served super hot.

Broth is very salty though, I had to drink lots and lots of water after.

Over-all an A-OK Pho place. Would come back to try their rice dishes, appetizers, and drinks.

{"text":"We dropped by opening weekend, so we knew there would be issues since they just opened. But what we got was far worse.
We ordered 
R.11 : Grilled chicken, pork chop with grilled beef on steamed rice $10.25 X 2 orders
TO GO
Since it was 9pm and our 8 month old was getting sleepy, we decided to order take out to go, it it was late so we didn't think to check the 4 Styrofoam take out boxes as we left. When we got home this is what we got:
2 containers of rice, 1 container with 1 piece of flattened chicken breast, and 1 container of a beef strip.
Remember, we said we ordered 2 servings? Well we only got 1, and not only that, but wheres the pork chop? It is the most expensive of the broken rice dishes, yet we didn't even get the full 2 servings, or even 1 full serving. There was meat missing, and it took 3 people to take down our order and yet it was still wrong. 

Now here's the best part:

Our order total that we were charged was $20.50 so, 
if $10.25 x 2= $20.50 X $1.13 (HST) = $23.17
What exactly did we get charged for? Looking at their to go menu that I took (in case we wanted to ever go back (what a joke right?)) I am trying to add up different combinations to see what the heck we ordered, or what they chose. But so far nothing.

This place has been under renovations for months, and when they finally opened I was slightly excited to have a Vietnamese Pho restaurant within walking distance. But I guess new tables and chairs can't help this failing business. They probably should have taken an extra week to teach their menu to their front-end staff as well as their cooks. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I will not be returning to this location. Avoid at all costs.

{"text":"I came here with my friend for lunch pho. Located in the Sheppard/Kennedy plaza, the plaza itself is quite busy as it's often had to find parking. The restaurant however, wasn't too busy when we arrived. I ordered the pho special 101 and thought it was average. The broth was alright but I've had better. The noodles and meat were just average and nothing really special about it. The price isn't too bad which was around $7. I also ordered the Vietnamese style coffee which a bit of a while to make. I was literally done my pho deal before I got it. Overall, an average place to eat pho. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their rice and appetizer dishes."}
{"text":"After my previous favourite pho place had let me down in all aspects of my last visit, I have been hunting for a new go-to pho restaurant. Pho Nhi is actually really well kept with their blue car seats and their black marbled tables. Came in for an XL house special.

Portion is great! 5/5

Noodles: They're thin but not as thin as I like them to be. It's great since they don't taste like the soggy \"ho fun\" that I get at most places that serve it as \"pho\" 4/5

Meat: There was a lot of meat. And all of it tasted really fresh. No unfresh fridge smell, tender but resilient. 5/5

Soup: A tad too salty in flavour. It made me thirsty afterwards. Also, it tasted like chicken broth? Saline water? MSG? It wasn't bad though but it didn't compare to the rich broths I've had at other places. 2/5"}
{"text":"Bun bo hue, pho, fried squid, fried chicken wings are my favourites here. Nice clean restaurant, quick friendly service."}
{"text":"I really never try it before, but I was planning to buy some pho to take away at 9:25 pm and they literally lock the door when I was about to enter the place. They supposed to close at 10:00 pm that day. That action was Pretty rude, I stopped in a cold winter night after my shift at work to buy something to eat. I hope the food is that good to support that kind of bad service."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many times I've driven past this plaza without ever noticing this Viet place. Luckily, my boyfriend and I are Yelp users and love to try a new place recommended by our fellow food lovers :)

This place is a lot bigger on the inside so seating is spacious and comfortable. The atmosphere is clean and very pleasant to enjoy a meal. Service is fast and friendly!

The food was wonderful! There's not many Viet places i don't enjoy to be honest but this place was so fresh. The meat didn't have that weird freezer burn texture which is normally why I avoid ordering beef slices. As per other yelpers, the broth was a bit salty and I think could have used a bit more flavor, but it was good. Portion was great and there's tons of meat :) good ratio between that and noodles.

The strawberry milkshake was light and really delicious :) didn't have that overwhelming milk or cream flavor which I enjoy. It was more like a smoothie 

I had ordered the grilled pork and shrimp on sugar cane over vermicelli for myself. It was really good!! Such great portions here and everything tasted so fresh. Definitely leaves me with a fantastic first impression :)

If you're craving Viet, give this place a try :) thanks for another great recommendation Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Ambience was ok. Staff was efficient but not really friendly. Ordered P1 - Pho - large. Bowl was really huge. Taste like a regular pho - nothing particularly special."}
{"text":"Nice modern interior and a great bowl of pho. A lot of meat and tripe in my bowl, and good portion size for the price."}
{"text":"Pho tastes like Pho. 

It's good 

Eat it. 

If it's not good

Than don't eat it

This review is too short so I'm going to continue typing until I can submit it

Hmmm still not enough.  

Still typing. Why can't I submit? What's going on.   Ahh there we go !."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday evening with my family for our first time. As being Vietnamese, we generally don't go out for pho as much since it disappoints us every time. However, we decided to give this place a try since our uncle recommended it. We got there during dinner rush hour. However, the restaurant only had one customer there! So, that wasn't a good sign. 

Our waitress was fluent in Vietnamese. That was a good sign for authenticity. We got the \"com tam suon\" (broken rice with grilled pork) and pho tai nam bo vien  (pho with rare beef, beef brisket and beef balls).

To our shock, the food was a lot better than we expected! The broth was clear and hearty that compliments the well cooked noodles. The grilled pork on the rice dish was equally well cooked as it was charcoal grilled. My only complaint is that there wasn't a small soup bowl that came with the rice dish  (most restaurants do have that included). 

Overall, I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Got a hair in the noodle and the server asked me: do you want to take the hair out or change to a new one? Me: please cancel my order."}
{"text":"This is the first time I go here. The service staff is quiet slow and the attitude is not very much affable. The taste of food is good."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Pho place, nothing outstanding and nothing too bad 

Food: 3/5
Ordered P7 Beef brisket and slices pho. They had quite a generous amount of beef - one dislike is that the sides (bean sprouts, lime, leaves) came out some time after the Pho came out which is uncharacteristic of Pho places. We also ordered the spring rolls - wasn't a fan of this. It's not your traditional viet spring rolls with the flakey yellow outer shell. 

Good to go if you're craving pho around Kennedy/Shepard area (looking for a quick and inexpensive meal) otherwise, I'd personally go to either the Congee Queen across the street or the Very Fair Chinese restaurant right beside Pho Ni."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Our orders were taken promptly and our food came out quickly. Also, anything that we asked for, like extra bowls were brought to the table in a timely manner. 

I ordered a medium pho with rare beef and tripe and overall, I'd have to say it was average. I can't quite verbalize exactly why but it just didn't seem as good as the other pho places that I've been too.  Hubby agreed as well. 

So while there wasn't anything wrong with this restaurant, it wasn't fantastic either. Therefore, my rating of three stars."}
{"text":"Pho Nhi, the newest Vietnamese restaurant that opened at this location that numerous failed.

The menu is similar to other Vietnamese restaurants  with mainly noodles and rice dishes, good for casual meals.

Pho Special ($7.25) has a good amount of meat but not too filling as a small. I might need to order at least a medium next time. The broth has a really nice complex aroma of herbs but can be hotter. 

Iced Vietmanese Coffee ($3) was nice and strong. 

Service extremely fast, efficient and polite.

Parking always been an issue for this plaza."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for good pho in my immediate neighbourhood. I get the house special beef soup, the base is above average and I'm never disappointed in the meat - though it could be a little more well done than my preference. Bright, clean, and having news/CP24 or the game on the big screen is a nice touch. Grilled chicken is again above average, shaking beef is nice too. May not be the best pho in Scarborough, but it's close enough to compare with Pho-88 and the fact it's never super busy, comfy booths, and proximity to my house means it's going to continue to be a staple for as long as it's here. You won't be disappointed if you decide to try it out, but park in the covered area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends. The pho here is pretty good. The portion size is good with both noodles and meat, and there's nothing particularly missing from the bowl (but the broth is a bit salty). I haven't tried the other dishes, so I can't say anything about those. 

Service wise, this place is alright. There is a waitress who at first seemed off putting due to her facial expression, but I know very well what it's like to have a resting bitch face. There was nothing bad about the service she provided as she did her job efficiently. 

I would come here again for a quick eat, but it's not outstanding enough that I would particularly bring someone out with me."}
