{"text":"I hope that they improve their food because the location, and atmosphere are great!  I'll give Pops another try or two knowing that they are a new restaurant, but my first visit was unimpressive.  The pork bbq was tough and dry.  The mac and cheese tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  My son had the philly and fries and those were actually pretty darn good, but a bbq place is supposed to be known for it's bbq not the philly!  You place your order at a window which is ok, but the service was slow, disorganized and not that friendly.  Come on Pops!  Get it together!  We want you to succeed!  Hoping for a better return visit..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch excited for some bbq. Saw the reviews and thought I was worth a shot. Ordered the wing and onion rings as an app. The wings were great with good flavor and no extra fat. The blue cheese was so watered down I ate the wings without it. The onion rings were good but nothing extra special.
My fiancee ordered the pulled pork plater with Mac and cheese and baked beans. The pulled pork was cold with no flavor. The sweet bbq sauce we added on was watered down with now spice. The hot bbq sauce wasn't hot at all and again no flavor. The mac and cheese was more like soup and feel like they forgot to bake it. It was very bland and needed tons of salt to even eat. The baked beans also had zero flavor but had large pieces of pork in them. Wish they were warm and had salt because it had potential. 
Overall we were not impressed with the bbq and would recommend going to Mac's instead. I would come back for the wings but even then I would take them home and use my own blue cheese."}
{"text":"Great food as well as great service! Only down side is they ONLY accept cash, no debit/credit cards, ATM on-site though."}
{"text":"4.5.  I might be over rating but this area (Cornelius, North East Huntersville)  is under served by this type of BBQ restaurant.

I thought the Wings are awesome, smoked and fried.

$9.99 for a BBQ plate and two sides was reasonable.  The BBQ was good and for sides the onion rings are Good homemade and thick.  I thought the slaw was average.

Kids had BBQ plate and hot dog plate $6.00 with one side and a drink was reasonable."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday evening.  We had such a taste for BBQ & always like to help the local businesses first versus the chain restaurants. I had the pork combo & my wife had a pork sandwich. Unfortunately we were both disappointed. Probably some the worst pork BBQ we ever had. The combination was a pure disappointment from portion size to taste. My 2 hushpuppies were over cooked as well as the Mac n cheese. The top layer of cheese was cold and dried out. Literally I counted 7 French fries I was given as one of my sides.  Seriously?!  Going into the meal we were hopeful with the two reviews we read. Sorry Pops you just didn't cut it."}
{"text":"Big fan of the pulled pork and pops hot sauce. Handcut fries seem cooked to order, which is nice."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, they forgot my baked beans, but I decided to give Pop's another try today.  I went in for lunch to get some bbq to go.  I was thinking it would be something quick and easy to eat during my lunch break.  I ordered the bbq plate with slaw, and brunswick stew.  I made the mistake of ordering fried green tomatoes as well.  I was the only customer that ordered that I saw the entire time I was there.  I sat for 30 minutes to get an order that was basically pre-made, except for the fried green tomatoes.  The nice lady that took my order was very apologetic, but with it being the only order, you would think the food would have been out much more quickly.  The bbq wasn't great.  I didn't care for the slaw or brunswick stew.  The fried green tomatoes were pretty good (If you don't mind waiting 30 minutes)  The hush puppies were good.  I hope these guys get it together, because they definitely don't have it together right now."}
{"text":"I liked the food, but they need some improvements in there sauce choices.  Also there Mac and cheese could use some more flavor.  Overall the bbq was good quality and smoked well. I will say the french fries were excellent and the atmosphere is perfect for this area.  Lots of room and a great place to have lunch.  I believe this place has a chance to be really good with some simple menu fixes."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this new restaurant and it did not disappoint. I ordered the pulled pork plate, with French fries and cole slaw. The French fries were like steak fries, thick, soft and chewy. The cole slaw was vinegar not mayonnaise based and was on the sweet side. The pulled pork was moist and very flavorful. There was a hot vinegar based sauce in a squeeze bottle on each table. Topped off with an Octoberfest Sam Adams, this was a really nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"Not very good at all. I was in the mood for some bbq. Ordered the half rack of ribs with mac n cheese and collard greens and it was just not very good at all. The ribs seamed more steamed or oven baked than smoked. They were no crispy charred areas . The sauce was pretty good. The macncheese was mushy. The collard greens were sweet. I've never had them sweet before. Not a fan. The hush puppies were ok. I was really craving some real bbq. This was not it. Will not be back. I hate to down a local business  but it was just bleh."}
{"text":"Y'all. This place is amazing. My husband and I have driven by many times and finally got to try it out this weekend. The food is excellent, and the customer service is even better! When we got there (with our 2 month old in tow), the woman taking orders let us know there was going to be a bit of a wait (didn't want us to have to deal with a cranky kid while we wait for our food). I definitely appreciated her honesty as it's nice to know what to expect when eating out with a little one--they can stay content for only so long! She was very apologetic that we had to wait so long for our food (which was only 30 mins--which isn't bad for fresh, delicious barbecue) but when it came out, it was definitely worth the wait! The hushpuppies....I've never had better hushpuppies in my life. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I know they have fried green tomatoes but happened to be out of them that day--I will be back for those for sure! I would highly recommend this place. They have a nice outdoor seating which my husband and I enjoyed on a lovely day. I just can't say too many good things...just go! And bring me a plate of those hushpuppies while you're at it ;)"}
{"text":"Ok - Pop's is finally open! And I couldn't wait to try them out. A side from the new biz headaches and confusion, my experience was better than good...

Here's the scoop: I showed up for lunch at 12:10 and had to wait a bit to get my order in, but long enough to get upset or uncomfortable! 

I ordered the half rack of baby backs and a side of pulled pork to make my own sampler plate (they shod make that option on the menu). I also got the slaw and beans as side items... The ribs were cooked perfectly, I just have two comments - pull the membrane off before you smoke your racks, and I wanted a bit more spice... The sides were prepared well too. But I would have to say my favorite part of the meal were the hush puppies! AMAZAballz!

The family run business was very friendly and where they get the ordering and food distribution process down they will have a winner! Thanks Pop's - I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"There are always those times a Yelper wishes for the ole zero stars. This would be one of those times. I've had Pop's bookmarked and found my hunger and their location intersecting nicely at lunch time today. That's where the Zen moment ended. 

According to my ticket, I ordered at 12:13.  Then I sat, sat, sat, sat....  During the sitting, I noticed others who were there before me also sitting. None had food, all had sort of sad or frustrated looks on their faces and I realized, \"I think I look like them\". Eventually, some would get food and trudge out the door with to-go bags, still looking upset.

At 12:40, the woman who took my order came and asked what I ordered, I handed her my ticket and she walked to the back. At 12:43, a woman who had left with a big to-go order was back. Apparently some of the order was missing. 

At 12:49, I went back to the counter and asked for my money back. 36 minutes after I ordered I got back my money, never got any bbq. The picture accompanying this review = lunch. It was ok..."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. The hush puppies are dense. The pork had lots of flavor and was moist. I got cole slaw and their fried green tomato sunday special. The hand written menus and red and white checkered clothes definitely give a more humble vibe."}
{"text":"Good ribs. I would like more sides and they often run out of ribs.  I do like the owner and wish him good luck. I know they just opened and sometimes it does take awhile to adjust the amount of food needed for the night. Would love to see a few more healthy sides and maybe some potatoes salad and macaroni salad as options. Just would like to have a selection to go with my ribs. Maybe a nightly side special. Can't wait for the warmer weather to sit outside. Hope pets are welcme at the outside talbes"}
{"text":"Really good barbecue.  Not traditional, not Lexington, not Eastern style-but still good.  i'm glad this place is open."}
