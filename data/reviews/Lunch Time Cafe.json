{"text":"Amazing food that is extremely fresh. Their homemade soups are incredible! They are family owned and everything is very reasonable. You gotta try it for dine it or to go!"}
{"text":"I heard this \"Mom and Pop\" place had good sandwiches so we stopped by to check it out. The bread was soft and it tasted good! Price was nice less than $6 for a sandwich that was bursting! Salad was nothing special. I gave it 3 stars because the service was NOT good. The cashier, who I found out was new, rolled her eyes at me when I was ordering for a friend. She had an attitude that wasn't customer friendly and for a first timer, I would consider not return after a first impression."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito, spicy chicken soup (fresh every Tuesday) are amazing!!! Plus the owners a sweethearts!! Best breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great sandwiches. Family owned, and very well priced. I would recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great sandwiches, clean and friendly place. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I would give over 9000 stars if I could! I have been coming to Lunch Time Café for over 8 years now. I can't get by as often as I would like now as I don't live or work close. The food is always amazing. I have tried a large variety from the menu and I have NEVER been let down. They make the best sandwiches I have LITERALLY ever eaten (don't tell my mother.) Their salads are amazing and yummy and they are generous with the ingredients. My favorite thing they serve is their delicious albondigas! The food is amazing but the staff is even more amazing! They are family owned and operated and they genuinely care about their customers. I would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good, simple food. Fresh, well priced. Very busy at lunch time! Variety of traditional American sandwiches, hot and cold. Both the BLT and the Italian sausage were really delicious."}
{"text":"What an Awesome café.  Everything is always super fresh and the staff couldn't be nicer.  I've tried most everything on the menu and so far everything has been excellent."}
{"text":"Always good.  10 points for Consistent.  Meatball sandwich better than subway, Tuna Salad salad, my favorite! Sometimes hard to call in orders because of busy signal."}
{"text":"The Cecilia special is the best breakfast you can buy in this neighborhood for probably about 10 square miles. It rivals huevos rancheros from a full diner (like Harlows in Tempe) but it's also unique - a dish all it's own. Their breakfast burrito is also superior to all the other local restaurants in this class in the area (Burger Shoppe, Obregon, etc). Their lunch menu is diverse and tasty. Good quality meats and veggies with decent portions. Soup and chili are on par. Great service (champ) and a comfortable atmosphere. TRY THE BREAKFAST - ESPECIALLY THE CECILIA."}
{"text":"Best lunch getaway in the area! Always fast and friendly with excellent customer service.  The food is always fresh and awesome!"}
{"text":"Egg salad is always a scary yet tempting food. Some places it is good and some places you are taking fate by the hand. 
Lunch time cafe is both fresh and delicious from there sold fresh bread , there fresh supplies to their happy cheerful demeanor. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service in the heart of an industrial area/park.  Friendly owners/managers make you feel like family.  Excellent sandwiches offered on a variety of fresh breads.  Definitely worth a lunch stop!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I go here all the time! The food is always amazing. The staff are always very friendly and professional. As I am sitting here writing this review my mouth is watering for the #23. Everything always taste so fresh and delicious. I am not too fond of the roast beef as I like the boars head roast beef cut thin that you can get from the store and they don't have that here. But that does not change that fact of everything they do have is always really good. You haven't been here then you need to try it. You will not be able to come here only once!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was fresh and delicious. The bread was very good and the meat was perfect. Can't wait to eat here again so I can try the soup."}
{"text":"Great food and very clean, I had to get my windows tinted so I stopped to eat and the owner recommended a chicken sandwich, OMG it was the best ever I never had any sub that tasted that great, very nice family business, him and his kids make the place very welcomed, I'll come here even its 15 miles away from my house, God bless him and his family. We need more places like this. Very very clean."}
{"text":"Best chef salad  and egg salad sandwiches in the valley. I use to work in the area and would stop frequently for lunch. Now that I work so far away I can only get on occasion and it take me my whole lunch hour just to drive to pick it up. Hope they open another location near the airport."}
{"text":"Great Greek Salad, very friendly staff, fast service even near closing time, and great price. I will come back the first chance I have."}
{"text":"Was working in the area, saw the reviews on yelp figured I'd give it a shot. The staff was incredibly friendly the ingredients were really fresh and the prices were good. I really don't have anything to criticize so great job keep doing what you guys do!"}
{"text":"This is a fun and friendly Phoenix lunch stop. The menu is mostly subs and salads, and special orders are the specialty here. Order at the counter for take-out or dining in."}
{"text":"Average

While the menu offers a number of different offerings the food is kind of average. The prices are reasonable and will accommodate those on a budget. 

On this visit I tried the meatball sandwich and chicken noddle soup. Both were okay, however, nothing special.

To end on a positive note the service was fast and friendly, and the restraunt is very clean."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive, but all of the hot sandwiches come with Swiss cheese.  I am sure they would substitute with american cheese if I asked. This the one of the places that asks if you want spicy and mean it. Great service!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A friendly, little, no frills lunch spot located in a industrial park of Phoenix. The owners and staff appear to know most of their patrons by first name. Patrons are mostly blue collars from the surrounding businesses. 

Food: I must admit they have an impressive selection of cold and hot subs/sandwiches (25!) as well as soups and salads for such a small place. Everyone seems to order the chili but I had the chicken cordon blue hot sub on wheat and it was great. Good sized portions as well.

Price: all subs in the 6 dollar range.

Service: Staff is super friendly, make you feel like you belong there even if it's your first time here. I could easily see why there's so many regulars here.

Summary: A great lunch spot with a super friendly vibe!"}
{"text":"Some customers invited me to go along for lunch. They make sandwiches and soups and salads. I had a hot pastrami and Swiss on white. Good quality meat and bread. They turn over quite a few customers both inside and take out pretty quickly. They have Pepsi products! Their customer base is from the industrial area around them so they close weekends. As do most sandwich shops in similar surroundings. I only eat about 2-3 sub sandwiches a year but if that is what I want and I am in the area I would certainly pick this place over a chain.  

3.4 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and soup. Today I had the albondigas soup and the roast beef sandwich. They were both so good.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful as well!This is the second time I have eaten here and I am truly impressed!"}
{"text":"I have noticed this deli for a while, it is right down the street from my work.  Today I thought I would give it a try and am glad I did!  It is a family owned shop, very friendly people.  I ordered the Albondigas Soup, fresh and homemade and quite delicious!  The menu looks like a wide variety and great prices.  I can't wait to go back to try one of the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This little spot is a hidden gem since there is pretty much nothing around this area to eat.
We were in this area because my fiancé and a coworker had to go do something and they were hungry so this is what popped up.
They don't have a huge selection for food but what they have is amazing and you could tell that it's homemade and fresh. I got a bagel sandwich omg it was so delish. Came with a fried egg ham bacon. They weren't cheap when it came to the meats everything tasted so good. My fiancé had the Han breakfast which he ate all of. His coworker ate the everything breakfast burrito..
The owners are so nice and truly love what they are doing  and cooking... 
awesome little place to go eat"}
{"text":"Quality quality. I just came in for bfast and everything was good AND cheap. Eggs, bacon , ham , toast and fruit for $6 THATS IT! I'm sure the sammies are good but il have to update that."}
{"text":"Was looking for a change of pace recently. I love hidden treasures in the valley and figured I'd try this one. After all, it was rated 5 stars. I tried the chicken filet sandwich just like the picture. The first half was good until I noticed it was precooked frozen chicken, like the bags that Costco sells. Because of that I don't think I'll be coming here again. I feel that there are better sandwich shops around the area. 3/5 stars I feel is more than generous of a rating."}
{"text":"OK, here's the deal. 

I didn't have a yelp account before today, although i use yelp everyday. i never have been inclined enough to take the time to open one because i am VERY hard to please and have VERY high expectations.

I eat out for lunch everyday M-F. I cant persuade you enough to spend all of your money here. To me, food is only half of the lunchtime experience. The other half is customer service, and i have to say, personally i have never witnessed and better representation of that.

The Food --

A+, heart, love and soul goes into every step and ingredient. I do not want to under sell this place. I have only written 1 review for food in my life and it was due to a pure disgusting experience at Pizza Hut. so for me to take the time to do this as my sandwich gets cold because i cant wait to share with everyone how great this place is, is a big deal.

I Got a Chicken breast sandwich, and they threw it together in less than 2 minutes. Inside the perfectly toasted bread was freshly grilled onions (with spice), A generous and juicy warm high quality chicken breast topped with my choice cheese melted perfected to adhere the ingredients together. Fresh sliced tomato sat gently on the melted cheese and the chicken was being lifted from the bottom slice of bread by a layer of fresh and perfectly ripe avocado. This family run company ACTUALLY CARES about the food that leaves the building.

When i got back to my office about 3 minutes later i anxiously unwrapped this little masterpiece. As i pulled this sub from the brown paper bag, there was white paper tightly wrapped around the sandwich like a tortilla. The paper was almost see- through from the fresh steam and grease of the grilled onions. To some, this may sound gross, but to me, being a sandwich buff from Chicago, it means it was done correctly. The flavor was a perfect marriage of spice, chicken and mayo and was just a perfect mouth experience. 


Staff --

What can i say? like watching ants trying to escape from a small jar. such precision and fast movement. Great system in place to serve fast and hot high quality food. That being said, its not what i noticed most about the staff. Apparently an 11yr old family run establishment that has no problem keeping the doors open. I would have to say one of the most happy and friendliest experiences of my life. It was like hanging out with a group of good buddies and getting food at the same time. Very pleasant and knowledgeable staff! A+ Guys, seriously.

Price--

Better than subway. $5-$10 if you want soup and a drink. The sub is about a foot-long, for 5.99. Put that in your toaster and toast it subway!


Thanks for reading. Now what are you waiting for? Go eat there."}
{"text":"Very good service and very friendly staff. I found this place by accident and will definitely be going back. I got the roast beef with mushrooms and cheese sub on wheat bread and it's so good."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot. Food is  excellent, sandwiches made with care, employees care.  Clean and personable.  I'll be back again.  #21 on Rye with Chicken Noodle soup my choice!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Cute, quaint deli/ cafe. Awesome tuna sandwiches on sourdough with yellow chilis. Yumm. All of the employees are super friendly and the service is always fast and accurate, even during the lunchtime rush!"}
{"text":"We were making a run down to Marjon's Pottery Shop and planned to have lunch somewhere nearby. Not wanting Mexican again, we did a quick search of nearby eateries and found The Lunch Time Cafe.

When we walked in, we were greeted by very friendly folks behind the counter and an enthusiastic thumbs up from a customer when he realized this was our first time.  He told us they make the best sandwiches and we'd love it.

It took us awhile to decide what we wanted and the place started to get busy but they were mostly \"to go\" people and were in and out quickly.  I noticed that a lot of the people were ordering the Albondigas soup so we figured we would try it.

That SOUP!....was so good.  Lots of little flavorful meatballs in a chunky soup.  We loved it and even went back to get a \"to go\" for dinner.  They should sell it by the Quart.

My husband ordered the Pastrami, Cheese and Sauerkraut on Marble Rye...delicious and loaded with pastrami.  No skimping on the meat and my husband loved it.
The owner recommended to me a Chicken Sandwich with Avocado and it too was just wonderful.  We also bought some of their bread to go...because really...the bread is key.

I love small places like this where the food is wonderful and the workers really take pride in their business and appreciate your patronage.  This will be our go to place when in that area from now on.

...i'm thinking about their food right now...mmmm."}
{"text":"I don't normally give five stars but this is one of the better lunch places I've been to while traveling for work in Phoenix. They have so many options to pick from and multiple breads to choose when you order a sandwich. The pastrami on rye is probably my favorite. The service is always consistent and awesome. The hours are kind of funny as it really only caters to lunch through the weekday so make sure you arrive right before noon . I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"threw out the sandwich I just bought for $8 as the croissant tasted like bananas and the meat was stringy and blobbed on. I called ahead and said no tomatoes  they did not have order ready and did not make it the way it was ordered  GROSS  too many other places in the valley to try   won't be throwing my money away here again"}
