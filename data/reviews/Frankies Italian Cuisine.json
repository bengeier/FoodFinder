{"text":"Frankie's is yummy. The spicy marinara with angel hair is wonderful. The Frankie's dinner salad is the scrumptious. And Nancy, our server, she's the bomb."}
{"text":"First time at Frankie's. We had takeout - so can't comment on table service at this time.
We had three different entrée and I want to say they were good.....overall.
The eggplant Parmesan was one if the best I have had.  Perfectly seasoned.  Not overly greasy. Not mushy. Sauce was flavorful..... And right amount of cheese!  The side of spaghetti that came with it was a lot.....I mean .....more of the \"side\" dish than the main entrée.  I would rather get more of what I ordered (eggplant) and not fill up on spaghetti.  So overall the amount of food was plenty and taste was very good. but sadly it was heavy on the side dish and only 4 medallions of eggplant.
The cheese tortellini was supposed to have red pepper pesto \"sauce\". It was more like red pepper compote. Not \"saucy\" enough......so the dish felt a bit on dry side. It did have good amount of olive oil though.
The manicotti was good. Right amount of sauce and cheese. Same sauce as the eggplant dish. Flavorful!
Their dinner salads are 99% lettuce + 2 cherry tomatoes and 2 single rings of red onion. For the price they charge, I would expect a decent salad. Not just lettuce.
All said - I like their food. But they need to balance the portions of main entrée and side dish. For $14-18 a piece, they should include a nice salad instead of mostly lettuce.  I will go again and have a dine in experience and update the review!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say that we just stopped at Frankies and found it closed.  Calling the Great Northern store, I was told that Westlake closed its doors on October 1.  It will always be 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I lived in and around Westlake, Ohio for over ten years but did not discover this place until my last three years but I was thrilled when I did!  Having grown up in an Italian family, I am always looking for good Italian food - particularly good \"gravy.\"  Frankie's never disappointed.  My two favorite dishes were the Manicotti and the house specialty, the Chicken Tosca.  The chicken is always melt-in-your mouth tender, and their marinara sauce the best!  Good portions for the price, too.  Too bad I moved to Clearwater, Florida a year ago but I recently came back to the area for a visit and Frankie's was my first stop!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  First made the mistake of going to the wrong location with a coupon.  They said they would take it but not for the full amount.  We should have walked out.  Either take the coupon or not.  the food is just so so.  We had not even finished our salads and the hot food was at the table.  They don't know how to time orders.

The place is not handicapped accessible.  The restroom is up some steep steps in the back past the kitchen.  The place needs a major update.  The staff was not that friendly.  The meal was overpriced."}
{"text":"Thanks for your message. I would have gladly shared my disappointment with your staff however our order was for take out. 

Good luck,

{"text":"The original Frankie opened at the corner of Lorain & Porter in the 1960's and their pizza is the best.  After all these years I always compare every pizza I have with Frankie's and the others always fall short. I also like the spaghetti & meatballs."}
{"text":"We have gone here for years.  Generally, the food is good, quantities are large and the service is great.  However, this past Sunday, we had to wait the longest ever to get our food and then just as our food came out, the waitress asked us if we would move because they had a party of nine that they wanted to accomodate.  If we had gotten our food in a timely manner, we would have already been gone.  The tables on either side of us, came in after us, ordered their food, got their food and left while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many one star reviews. I had dinner with my family here tonight for the first time in several years. 

Pros - Margharita (sorry... spelling) pizza was very good. Crust was a touch soggy, but we added sausage so maybe our fault. Otherwise no issues at all. 

My toddlers devoured the fried ravioli. Two orders worth.

Cons - The only con really was an empty water glass. Service was pretty slow. I know it takes time to make the pizza, but we didn't get many refills. While waiting, we ordered wine, soup (didn't try but my husband says it was very good), and extra apps.

I will go back and reevaluate. I'd recommend the pizza."}
