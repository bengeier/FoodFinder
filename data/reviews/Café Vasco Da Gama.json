{"text":"What a fancy joint. Stunning tile murals line the back wall and the front is strategically packed with a wide selection of wine bottles, coffee and artsy ceramic items. There are a couple of enormous paintings (one of them looks like a classic depiction of Zeus) and massive mirrors on the wall that make the narrow cafe look more spacious than it really is. 

The staff moved a mile a minute to serve dozens of people waiting for their caffeine fix or sandwiches. Despite the pressure, they do an admirable job of maintaining composure and a genuine smile. There isn't much space between the seating area and the service area, so after paying for my meal, I stood around awkwardly, trying to avoid getting in the way of the many patrons behind me. 

The supervisor was extremely apologetic about the long wait for my sandwich - \"Le Pecheur\".  This egg and salmon breakfast wrap is small and served with fruit. The thin slice of salmon was fresh and smoky, but also overly salty. The other ingredients include plain cream cheese, capers, spinach and barely seasoned eggs. Based on the price, I was underwhelmed by the wrap. Indeed, this upscale cafe charges an arm and a leg, but they certainly deliver when it comes to their drinks. 

I had a latte that was so bold, full-bodied and delicious, all my price-sensitivity melted away in the steam... I came back the day after for an iced coffee, which was creamy, rich and beautifully presented in 3 layers (whole milk, coffee and foam with chocolate sprinkles). The third day, I tried their mocha (along with 3 gourmet chocolates). The mocha is rich with a deep aroma and pleasant after taste of real cocoa. It was complimented well by the chocolates."}
{"text":"I ordered Agneau Confit and Canard with salad and soup. Before tax $30. Need to order at food counter and paid before food delivered."}
{"text":"We ordered cottage cheese + fruits, omelette.  Good food but nothing spectacular. Service was friendly, nice atmosphere with Mediterranean music played in the background. Problem: the seating is cozy with other patrons."}
{"text":"Great little spot to catch your breakfast. Showed up right at 7am and service was quick and very admirable.  Loved the vanilla filled pastry right on the counter. Ordered the \"omelet de vasco da Gama \". Good and clean breakfast with a hint of chorizo and cheese. Needed my Mexican salsa smothered over but that's just me."}
{"text":"Traditional cafe style food. Probably could find better but this is fast and cheap. The ordering and paying system is a bit complicated but gets things done. Lots of people and pretty noisy, but good for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Duck sandwich is super!
Got here because they picked my Bixi key on street, they called and returned it back to me. Super nice guys. And it's a good chance to try it out. The duck Sandwich is super. I will come back with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Went there with friend on one of those it-seemed-warm-but-not-really days for lunch, I had their tuna burger with chicken salad (that had chickpeas). I've never had a tuna burger like that, the consistency was like tartar, rather than a fillet of tuna stuck in the middle of two pieces of bread. It was delicious and we also had a pastel de nata for dessert. I don't really have a sweet tooth, but portugese egg tarts are one of my favourite desserts; and the ones they serve here are amazing! Tell them to heat it up a bit so it'll taste even yummier!"}
{"text":"Try their lamb burger, yumm! Service can be bit cold and slow, which I take one star off."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast

Food was good nothing that I will remember for the next week but great for breakfast or a quick snack."}
{"text":"the quick and dirty - on a great place

Atmosphere: Cafe Vasco Da Gama (henceforth referred to as CVDG) has been around for a while.  A cafe that serves food, it's offend crowded with couples and busy working professionals - its a great place to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!)

Food: Tunal Burger?! Yes please - a specialty of the place, CVDG surges paninis, soups, deserts and coffee that are both temptingly good and filling.  Never had a bad meal here.

Service: since the place can be quite crowded, be prepared to wait a little bit to be seated.  Choices are made in person at the counter, and food is delivered to you once its ready.  Minimal service, but always pleasant and courteous.

Pop in for a bit during the work day but my favourite time to visit is during the early hours of Sat / Sun - people are a lot more relaxed and there's a general sense of easy about the place as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow.  Summer times even bring a few outdoor tables for some open air render-vous

You should go :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!! We stopped in one morning and found ourselves coming back!! Delicious food, AMAZING croissants, friendly service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Un jeune homme m'a recommandé ce cafe !Je dois lui dire merci pour la découverte de ce cafe portugais qui sert du cafe italien .Beau décor ,Belle musique et bon cafe !Quoi demande de mieux!!!!"}
{"text":"Back two years later just for the lamb burger and still as delicious as I remember!  Definitely a place I will visit every time I go to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe. Come early. It gets very busy during lunch and don't expect much in terms of service. Also don't expect to get a table, it's probably best to take out. I always have the lamb burger which l find is delicious. It comes with a small side salad which you can choose. The tuna burger is also very good, not cooked all the way through and very flavourful. If you have them bring it to your table it can take a very long time. It's a bit on the pricy side if you just wanted to grab a quick lunch but I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, this place is a must for breakfast/brunch/ lunch. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Always like this place. But probably because it developed well, it starts to be snob and not polite."}
{"text":"Perfect little cafe. Upbeat yet calming music, wifi, and great cafe au lait. I also had the chocolate croissant which was filled with chocolate spread and lots of hazelnuts!!! Great way to start a Sunday morning!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for coffee and desert.  They serve Illy coffee, and they have a number of pastries and other goodies.  It is a little crowded and noisy, but hey - it's a cafe."}
{"text":"Superbe ambiance au temps pour les déjeuners que pour relaxer après une bonne journée de travaille. Les tapas son excellent et le vin est delicieux."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick but classy lunch bite!

The duck and fig pressed panini is DELICIOUS and there's always a good choice of hearty side salads. 

The place is decorated in brightly-coloured Mediterranean-style tiles and the small narrow layout is great for eavesdropping!

Sit by the large open window in summer - great people-watching!"}
{"text":"This is my misters favorite brunch place. Every time I bring up brunch, this is the first place he suggest. To be honest, I don't blame him. Good food, good music, good service. What more can we ask for ? 
Owned by the same owner as the higher end restaurant next door, vasco is a more affordable and trendier option for people who are looking to grab a quick bite, or catch up over coffee and desserts. 
  Although the cafe is always jam packed with people (mostly business people who work downtown), it's never too hard to find a seat. Plus the owner/manager is always extremely enthusiastic, making sure that you don't have to wait long for be seated. 
As for the food, it is FANTASTIC! I've tried the chicken chorizo burger, chicken chorizo wrap, tuna burger as well as their breakfast wraps. All are amazing, especially the tuna and chicken chorizo burger. Their coffee and desserts are also extremely good. Warning, they are highly ADDICTIVE, especially those cookies. This is the perfect spot to catch up and munch on some sweets after shopping, both of which I've been doing too much of. 
  Anyways, vasco de gama is a total jem in my books and i would 100 % recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little cafe.  The food has always been great and they have the best coffee. 

The staff have always been very friendly and kind."}
{"text":"This place was very close to my hotel. My first day I just wanted a mocha to whet my appetite for caffeine and coffee after a 5 hour train ride. If its a place not known for good espresso/coffee and they grind Illy beans it essentially means they're all show, so their espresso actually sucks - I deduced, I never tried it. However, I don't know what they do with their mocha mixture, but that cup of mocha was so delicious I couldn't believe it. It was like a semi-sweet with cocoa... I dunno, but it was actually heavenly. Just be aware that I went there 4 times and got one bad one...so keep that in mind if you're looking for this amazing mocha because of this review in Montreal. Essentially though this place isn't much different than the 1000's of other cafe places in Montreal, but this mocha is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so cute the way they are setup. They have really. Good sandwiches and salads. Their coffee is good too. I was there for lunch, had a turkey sandwich with salad on the side. The portion was perfect and the food was really tasty. 

The only thing is it is a bit tight especially lunch time. I had to set too close to some strangers. Still, it is one of my favorite spots in the Montreal."}
{"text":"I passed this cafe many times and noticed they served Illy coffee which I love.  So on my last day in Montreal I went here to have Sunday brunch.   I had the croque matin, a mocha, and pasteis de nata.  The food was satisfying but not out of this world.  The mocha was great.  The cafe is a very cool place to hang out with friends.  They offer all sorts of pastries and products you can take home like wines, coffee, teas, spices, etc."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and coffee during a weekend trip to Montreal. I enjoyed it so much that I returned every day of the trip! The pleasant, prompt service kept me going back. The croissants were fresh and soft. I especially liked the Mediterranean omelet, which was not greasy and had a delicious ingredient combination. I also enjoyed the cleanliness and European design of café."}
{"text":"Yummy Portuguese coffee shop right in the middle of downtown. Intimate, Cosy ambiance, great spot to for afternoon tea / coffee chat with your friend. Try the duck and fig panini or the grilled vegetable with goat cheese panini...Sit by the windows and people watch. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Wish I found this plc at first day I visited montreal, smoky salmon omelet which very interesting and  unique taste, and come with fresh fruits. Free wifi."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for breakfast - it's a soft awakening with quiet and relaxing music, a hushed atmosphere, delicious omelettes (I love the \"omelette nature\" with added cheese). The café au lait is delicious. 
I am not a morning person - but I would wake up early to go here."}
{"text":"So, it was my last day in Montreal and I wanted something with a French feel.  I had eaten poutine.  I had eaten crepes.  I wanted to go to a real French restaurant, but many of them were only open for dinner and were very pricey.  So, of course I turned to yelp and I saw pictures of the beautiful baguettes and I was sold!
As, I approached the café I was already happy with my choice.  It was quaint and had the feel of some of those great cafes in Paris.  There were people dining on the sidewalk and the place was hoppin so I knew it must be good.  
So I walked in and asked for a table.  I was given a table and then told to go to the counter to place my order.  Now, unfortunately for me the menu was completely in French.  It definitely gave me the French feel I wanted, but made ordering a little more difficult for me.  Luckily, the young lady behind the counter came out and walked me through it.  I was already thinking about a baguette and I could read enough French to kind of figure out what I wanted.  I asked if there was a ham and cheese sandwich on a baguette and she said no, it's prosciutto, cheese, and butter on a baguette.  Well, that sounded right up my alley.  The sandwich came with a choice of salad or soup.  I chose the tomato soup.  Once I ordered I still had to wait in line to pay.  This gave me time to look at the desserts.  There were so many and they all looked fabulous, but in the end I went for portability so that I could take it with me for an afternoon snack and ordered the blondie.  As soon as I paid and sat down my food was brought out.  The soup was very good, but the baguette, well that was a thing of beauty.  It was soooo good.  I live in Florida where the humidity seems to destroy any attempt at delicious crusty bread, so I was in heaven.  
I ended up taking 1/2 the sandwich with me to eat on the train to Toronto later that day and ate my amazing blondie as an afternoon snack.  If I am ever back in Montreal, this place is on my list."}
{"text":"Déjà quand j'y ai mis les pieds, j'ai été agréablement reçu et étonnée de voir la place aussi achalandée! 

Par la suite, j'ai pu comprendre le pourquoi de la chose... Un bon choix de sandwichs savoureux servis avec un accompagnement au choix également (salade de patates douces, de lentilles, de légumes frais, etc.).

Des desserts également délicieux à choisir en direct devant ses yeux! Tout ça est très alléchant et s'est avéré délicieux!

On peut manger un sandwich rapide (même si je vous recommande de prendre votre temps, car c'est bien plus agréable) avec saveur comparé à un simple \"jambon-fromage\"."}
{"text":"Ambience is what you pay for here - trendy vibes and crowd, good music. Everything was overpriced. I had a mini almond tartine that was straight up brown sugar."}
{"text":"This cafe was suggested by the concierge of our hotel. My husband and I decided to eat breakfast here the first morning we were in Montreal. The coffee was very good as was the food. We shared an omelette and a bagel with cream cheese. The overall space was small but it was not busy when we went on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great place to have a delicious breakfast/brunch.

Came here with the girlfriend for brunch after getting a recommendation from a friend. Nice coffee shop with a great selection of food. When I went up to the counter, one of the employees introduced all of their specials to me. Great service. We settled on getting the club of the day and the Vasco Da Gama wrap, along with two lattes, along with a pasteis de nata (we were in a Portuguese cafe after all).

The wrap was tasty, it had eggs, chorizo, spinach and cheese in it. But the highlight was the club. Incredibly flavourful and every bite was delicious. The lattes were good as well.

All in all, a very solid way to start off our day."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised by their food and service. Ordered the duck confit and gig sandwich with the beet salad. I felt like the sandwich was missing something acid but the beet salad was so good that I can't stop eating it. Hubby ordered a simple prosciutto baguette with celery root salad and the olive salad. The baguette was really fresh and good for the sandwich. Sandwich was overall tasty as well. Nice spot. Good food. Good service"}
{"text":"Great brunch place, feels very cozy. The wagyu burger with foie gras is to DIE for & my boyfriend had the breakfast BLT sandwich which he rates 3.5*. Their patio is super cute too!"}
{"text":"A great spot for breakfast or brunch! They have a variety of teas, coffees, and pastries. Our group had hot chocolate, coffee, tea, and a lot of croissants - and everything was extremely good."}
{"text":"My serendipity café in Montreal. I love the ambience of this Café- an old vintage, comfortable seating and brunch options. Prices remained under $20 for their menu- pretty reasonable. Service was fast and the waitresses were knowledgeable about their specials of the day. I tried a freshly squeezed mixed fruit juice that had berries and watermelon as a base - super refreshing. For my main course I had the duck and fig sandwich served with a soup of the day or salad. The sandwich didn't really do justice to its title - the  duck was pulled and overpowered the other flavours (which is usually the case with duck as a main ingredient) but the sad part- I didn't even taste any fig or mango!! Which is why I picked this dish! The small Greek salad was nice and a perfect portion. I had a cup of coffee after my meal that totally hit the spot. I would stick to the assorted tapas menu- cheaper and more options to try among larger groups."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Decided to hit this spot up before doing the hike up from Peel to the Chalet du Mont Royal vista point. The place was charming, had great coffee and superb small breakfast items. I had the ham egg and cheese croissant and the partner had the chorizo egg cheese spinach wrap. Both came with a little bowl of fresh fruit. I might make this a routine if I ever do that hike again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but a little confusing because other reviews indicated there were gluten free options but when I asked about them, they looked like I had three heads. It might have been a little bit of a language barrier but overall, amazing amazing food... just hoping I didn't get accidentally *glutened*"}
{"text":"When I was in Montreal for our Dragon boat race, me and a few of my fellow teammates had breakfast here and it was a very well prepared breakfast. I had the yogurt with berries and granola. All the ingredients matched really well, but then again it's yogurt....can't really mess that up. One of my fellow teammates has the French toast and it was also delicious. One thing that could be improved on would be the attention from the waitress, We were one of 4 small groups in the whole restaurant and it took ages to get her attention."}
{"text":"The best almond croissants and custard tarts we have tasted 
Wish we could get them in California"}
{"text":"Vasco is owned by the same person/people who own Ferreira. The difference is that Ferreira is high-end, while Vasco is more affordable, offering a variety of sandwiches, salads and desserts. It's suitable for breakfast/ brunch/ lunch, while Ferreira is more suitable for dinner. Ironically, the service at Vasco is MUCH better than Ferreira. Both offer Portuguese dishes. 

Vasco has basic staples that you will always find on their lunch menu and these include tasty delights ranging from the bison and vegetarian burgers, to the Ferreira club and preserved lamb panini. They have such a great variety of options that you would be hard-pressed not to find something that pleases your palate. My personal favourites are the veggie burger (made with quinoa), the Club, and the grilled veggie and goat cheese panini. All three are amazing.  All burgers and sandwiches come with your choice of salad, and you can usually find 4-5 different salads being served (these all change daily).  While all of their salads are delicious, my go-to is the sweet potato with curried chicken. At least I think it's curried. Either way, it is damn good salad!

Their dessert selection is quite good for a small venue, and include the traditional natas and other pastries. If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll have to try l'Entrechoc - my FAVOURITE of all chocolate desserts! It's a tart with a firm crust (I think it's got a butter base but what do I know?) and i's filling is a combination of dark chocolate with caramel and whole hazelnuts. The top is a thin, crunchy crust. It's to die for! On that note, I've gotta go. There's an Entrechoc waiting for me with my name on it ;-)

I gave them a 4 because the place is very small, and when you order to go, you have absolutely nowhere to wait for your food, other than at the cash, which has a table right next to it. The table is next to the entrance where everyone piles in to wait for a table. A bit chaotic. If you're going for lunch, get there before Noon and you'll be fine. Remember that the hostess will assign a table number when you arrive, and you will order your food at the back. A server will bring your dishes to your table. You can pay after you have ordered, or when you're done."}
{"text":"Good place for random breakfast. Food was ok and clean. Stuff was very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast omelette!

It may be a cafe, but the food was also delicious. I had the Mediterranean omelette which came with a side of fruit and a tasted baguette. The flavors and veggies in the omelette created an awesome flavor and the inside of the omelette was perfectly cooked. 

A great place to stop and escape the cold, especially if you can grab a window view."}
{"text":"Went there with friends and thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere. Service, price & food was good. Would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"We have been frequent clients (around once a month) for over 10 years. 
I owed this review update. 
Great to ser that the restaurant's new dynamic has settled in. 
Great food as always. 
The canard & figue sandwich is simply delicious. 
Congrats to the restaurant team!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I have been way too many times! Their omelettes are great - my favorite is the turkey bacon omelette. I always get their perfection of a cafe au lait. Their lunch sandwiches are really good as well.
4 stars because the service is not very friendly or efficient."}
{"text":"Charming and comfortable coffee place downtown! Excellent cappuccino and perfect for a light meal !"}
{"text":"Central location. Good coffee.. though kind of posh. Go there if you enjoy this sort of atmosphere. The Portuguese cakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Super solid place to have a quick lunch after dropping our luggage off at Gare Centrale with our group of four.

It was a really quick walk from the station and I think I made the right choice as we walked in to a delightful buzz in the cafe.

The space is a well-lit long and narrow space with the service bar on one side and a collection of different seating arrangements along the other side.

The key thing on the menu is the made-to-order omelettes or the delicious looking sandwiches along the display window.

I went for a western style omelette that was made fresh and it was delicious. The two pieces of toasted baguette was a very very welcome addition to the meal.  So satisfying to hear that crunch of the bread and then dig into the fluffy egg afterwards.

I didn't have room for any dessert but they also looked very good. :-)

The only little hiccup was that they somehow lost the ticket for one of our orders.  We waited 15 minutes and then asked them about it.  Turns out the ticket somehow fell off the board and underneath one of the panini presses. :-\

I watched them make the order double-time so that was a good sign.

Would definitely want to come back again."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with really delicious food. I had the Mediterranean omelette and a Portuguese egg tart. The egg tart in particular was probably the best egg tart I've ever had! The only downside is how expensive their food is."}
{"text":"I visited here twice while in town.

The almond milk latte was good. I enjoyed it and would happily drink another...So Why such a low rating?

Well the service and attitude of the staff was deplorable. 

I came in around 830am both days with my 4 and 2 year old boys. ORdered a drink for myself and a snack for them...Both days we were treated horribly. One woman actually came over and removed everything from the table (including my children's silverware) and rolled her eyes when I asked for them back.

The next day while my kiddos were eating the gentleman working behind the counter came around and actually started to point at us and roll his eyes while speaking to someone else.

Side note: My children were NOT being un-ruly, loud or rude. One was sitting in my lap and the other on his little stool. They said Thank you and were polite."}
{"text":"A small place that's a bit tight, but the coffe, pastries, food, service and prices are excellent.  Enjoy your order, and the other patrons that you will share the space with."}
{"text":"Fancy lunch place to go to. 
I took their lunch special, which was a seafood sandwich with a soup. It was de-li-cious! Great food quality, the bread seemed to be those fabcy healthy bread haha Totally worth the price. They serve Illy coffee btw. 

Staff were friendly :)"}
{"text":"Seriously whoever came up with this stupid concept needs to go to hell. They make you take a seat, you order for yourself at the bar, no service. Im not at my mothers house, im supposed to be at a cafe: I came to relax not run around the restaurant ordering and waiting for it to come to me. You also have to pick up your own coffee, the only thing they bring to your table is the food. What? What concept is this? The hostess was also rude. Screw this place, im never coming again. I only lasted through this experience because my girlfriend wanted to stay, i wanted out within the first 4 minutes of being there."}
{"text":"Cafe doesn't have big tables - only small round shaky ones that can barely fit breakfast for three. Several tables can be put side by side, but seating is better suited for singles or couples.

I've ordered fisherman's omelette with Viennese coffee, latte and biscotti. Both beverages were rather good (they use Illy beans), I've easily consumed two cups, but I can't commend the omelette. While I really like Egg Benedict with salmon, their salmon omelette didn't work - two tastes just doesn't match each other. Biscotti wasn't impressive, but it was good enough - not too sweet and not too crumble.

My wife has chosen Mediterranean omelette with americano. Her omelette was much better than mine. Would've call it good if not for the olives.

Daughter got grapefruit juice, which was awesome, and chocolate croissant, which was good but a bit weird.

Overall, a nice place for breakfast if you just happen to walk next to it."}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to preface this by saying I am a barista for illy in Ottawa. The barista here lacks the skill to foam the milk and pull shots. The coffee had a burnt taste to it and the macchiato foam was not how it should be. I will not name or describe the barista out of respect but please improve in this area."}
{"text":"They serve Portuguese breakfast and lunch!  This means egg and custard tarts along with tapas (after 4 PM.)  Come in and line up at the counter where the cooks are working. Give someone your order and grab a table.  

This is not a large restaurant so go early if it's breakfast you want.  We were there around 9:30 AM. and there were no tables but a sweet Canadian (most are very gracious) offered us hers.  They serve illy coffee so my cappuccino was great, of course.  But does anyone serve a bad cup o' Joe in Montreal?"}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty selection. Friendly staff. Great brunch place. Get here early, as there can be a long wait."}
{"text":"100% Highly Recommend Café Vasco Da Gama which is One of my favorite spots to go for coffee or grab a bite in Montreal. Take it from me as a regular happy client - I often go there alone, with friends and often bring my clients there :)

Always friendly (they make you feel like your 2nd home) and have a helpful service even though it's often busy! Food is always delicious and there is an amazing selection on the menu. Food is always made from fresh ingredients cooked with lots of love. My suggestion while your there: Try any of their gourmet sandwiches and specially the Tuna Burger and Nata (Portuguese custard tart) - you won't regret it :)

* The only recommendation I would have for the store is to add more comfortable seats for people who have back challenges.

FYI: The Café Vasco da Gama takes its name from the great Portuguese explorer"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick crème brûlée before my flight on a business trip. I loved the little outside terrace where you can watch all the action on Peel Street. The service was good, although I never got my glass of water which was necessary after walking all the way from the Plateau! Still, I would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  I loved their food...I wish I had gone there sooner.  I would pass this place all of the time....then, one day I decided to go before I left Montreal.  Man, I so regretted that I didn't come here sooner...very good place to eat, and have some drinks as you relax from your hectic work day.  I recommend this place very much!!!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend staying nearby, checked Yelp for breakfast spots and this has strong reviews. The reviews are true, great location, very clean, quaint decor, very nice staff. Service was prompt both times we went, omelettes were fresh, original and not in any way greasy like a lot of places. Very friendly owner too."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food; very friendly service. You must try the almond tart with a good cup of coffee. An outdoor seat is particularly nice if you can nab one."}
{"text":"After an ill-fated attempt to grab breakfast at Universel - tip: don't go to this place at around 11:00 on a Saturday - we were wandering around trying to find somewhere else to eat. We stumbled on Café Vasco da Gama and were drawn in by its homey, intimate vibe.

We were quickly shown to a small table near the front, and I began scouring the menu for something appealing. I eventually settled on the Vasco da Gama wrap (\"egg, chouriço, São Jorge cheese, spinach\"), because how can you go wrong with those ingredients?

The answer is you can't, not really. And while this very simple wrap didn't blow me away, it's nevertheless a solid dish that I enjoyed eating. The ingredients all worked quite well together, and the food arrived hot (which meant that the cheese was still delightfully melty). I was admittedly a little disappointed in the lack of bold flavors, but this is a mild complaint. (I should note, too, that the backless stools get pretty annoying after a while.)"}
{"text":"Good coffee! This is the 1st time I've been here, won't be the last. It's a great alternative to the Starbucks universe. It's a very narrow space, but still a decent amount of seating. The only downside is you have to stand in line in such a narrow space to order your drinks & food and then you get seated, I would prefer they allow you to order at the table as space is severely limited. The little custard pastries right by the cash are AMAZING! Smart to put them there as an impulse buy since as you wait to order and pay you can't keep your eyes off them.......and they're delicious. You can't beat the location right in the heart of downtown. Definitely worth coming here for the coffee. I haven't tried the food but the other patrons seemed to really enjoy the food as well."}
{"text":"Its a gem.  Ugh...yes, I said it.

Order coffee, one of the many deelish freshly-made sandwiches, or soups, or breakfast meals.

Sit at the hip couches.

Get served by hot French waitresses and peep the hotties that eat in here."}
{"text":"Very nice little cafe to grab a nice lunch. I appreciated that I was able to get a burger, in addition to pre-made sandwich options. My only complaint is that the tables are very small and the cafe was busy, so there was not enough room on our table for all of our dishes (3 people)."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe in town. Lovely ambiance and amazing food especially the plats du jour. Always full for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday morning and was surprised that there were only a couple of seats available. It's a counter service cafe with omelettes and breakfast sandwiches. Illy coffee is served here. 

Had a vegetarian omelette and added cheddar cheese. The omelette was ok and didn't have a lot of filling. It's not a large portion. The omelette came with 2 pieces of mini baguette and a couple of pieces of fruit. 

Overall, it's ok. Not bad for a quick bite and a coffee when in the area, but not fantastic enough for it's prices for me to make the effort to go there."}
{"text":"Great ambiance in a European-style cafe. Terrific espresso drinks and their natas tarts are delicious and authentic, and they have a large tapas menu. Friendly staff in professional attire. Marble tile throughout. A classy place in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot when you're looking for something a bit more fancy but still casual. They assign you seating and then send you off to the counter to admire all of their offerings order and pay. Their soups are always fantastic and the sandwiches have quality ingredients. All my friends rave about the duck sandwich but I usually go for the roasted veggie! 

If you stop by for a coffee you have to get a Portuguese nata with it. They're absolutely delicious and the perfect amount of sweetness. 

I would avoid going from 12-1 as it gets very crowded thanks to the office lunch rush."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend. Everything was great and the ambiance was perfect. We quickly ordered two tuna burgers which looked fantastic. I bit into mine and immediately tasted something odd. I pinpointed the taste as having come from the tomato in my burger which was mushy and rotten. I was ready to let this slide as it's possible that the kitchen let it slip by unknowingly, except that it contaminated the taste of my burger. I was again willing to let this slide as I had eaten at the restaurant before and everything was great (And the coffee is excellent). However, 20 minutes after we left, my girlfriend and I experienced extreme nausea, stomach aches, faintness and flushing. I knew that this was not a simple case of an allergic reaction as not only was I sick, but so was my girlfriend (whose burger tasted fine). I am forever turned off from this restaurant, which is unfortunate because the coffee is amazing and all my other meals were great. It only takes one..."}
{"text":"After checking in at hotel stopped in for lunch and enjoyed the meal and service.Lamb pannini was great as was the duck pannini my spouse had.
Quick paced,place order at counter and food is brought to your table."}
{"text":"Great location in the downtown area, great coffees, super nice staff. Did I say I thought it was great? Yes, I did. . ."}
{"text":"Oooohhh Vasco de Gama, ce que je remercie ma sur de m'avoir fait découvrir ce petit spot sur la rue Peel. Café portugais localisé juste à côté du fameux Cafe Ferreira on y retrouve que quelques places assises. Dans la première section on a des banquettes et petits poufs et dans la section du fond des tables et chaises hautes. Le décor est parfait, des couleurs chaudes, des décorations qui nous transportent le temps d'un repas au Portugal et un service généralement accueillant (un peu moins dans les moments de rush). Le menu est diversifié, on retrouve différents types de sandwichs (celui au canard est à tomber et le club maison est aussi délicieux). Les salades varient quotidiennement, j'ai beaucoup aimé celle aux lentilles et choux fleur. On propose des desserts gourmants, les natas sont un incontournable. On ne peut pas venir au Vasco et ne pas avoir goûté au fameux natas (flan portuguais sur pâte feuilletée). La marque de café est ma préférée, Illy, alors si on est fan d'espresso on hésite pas (latte, cappuccino et comapgnie). 
PS il y aussi un menu déjeuner disponible: ex croissant jambon et ufs, avec salade de fruits, yaourt et muslix. Donc bonne option pour ceux qui se cherchent un spot agréable pour le petit déjeuner."}
{"text":"Popular lunch cafe on Peel Street. A friend from home recommended Vasco de Gama when she heard I was coming to Montreal. She highly recommended duck and fig sandwich which was a great choice. Variety of sandwiches, wraps, salads. Check in with staff for a table number, order at counter and they bring it to you at small tables. Good looking desert selection to go with large coffee/hot chocolate selection. Cafe is owned by Ferreira Cafe with is a very good Portuguese restaurant a few doors down."}
{"text":"Loved this place for a nice lunch. Tons of interesting dishes to choose from. I had the bison burger and butternut squash side salad. My friend had a chicken burger and the same salad. We both loved our meals and only wished there was more (although we were full when we left!) Great hip place -- highly recommended."}
{"text":"I nice alternative for coffee meetings, versus the typical coffee chains - you know who I am talking about. It's got a very European feel so much so that you could almost imagine you are visiting somewhere else. Case in point their Nata(s) - Portuguese Custard Tarts are tops from what I've tasted over the years. I stopped myself from ordering a bunch more. I was happy to see they now have a one page tapas menu after 4pm which adds to their fresh daily pastry selection and other light meals ie. burgers, salads, sandwiches oh and how could I forget their Euro style coffee selection. I believe table service is also on the new side. In sum they've raised their own bar. I even noticed a catering menu on the way out. The seating isn't traditional, but is still great for business chats. It's one of my first thoughts for downtown meetings."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for breakfast !!! Had their croissant with egg and cheese, very happy with it ! Croissant was perfect , had the crunch without the eggs inside making it soggy. Coffee was very good as well, strong and tasted good.  Very pretty !"}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe. It's in an area where there are many nice stores and things to do. They have tables and a couch/booth area. 

We came in for lunch and I ordered the Kobe beef burger and my wife and kids each had the burger of the month which was a cod burger.

My burger came with soup or salad and I chose the broccoli and cauliflower soup. The soup was excellent and it was definitely something I haven't tried before. The burger had the works and had blue cheese on it. I loved the burger and it filled me up and made me feel great.

The atmosphere was nice. You could order food or get treats. They had a decent sized case with brownies and cookies and other treats. It wasn't crowded but wasn't empty either and the waiter was attentive to our needs.

I would definitely stop here again. It was a little pricey for a cafe but it was expected given the area and the food ended up being well worth it."}
{"text":"Our hotel was nearby so we stopped in for lunch. All the sandwiches we tried were good and it comes with either soup/salad. But I am not sure if 12CAD lunch tag is typical here but coming from NY, I thought that was a bit pricey. Nonetheless, everything was good there. I also enjoyed the Portuguese egg tarts and their illy coffee. Grande coffee is huge...petit is good enough."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch our first day in Montreal, at the suggestion of the concierge. The food was good - especially the salads. My husband had the Greek salad and I had the salad with artichoke, avocado and tomato - amazing. Most of all, the staff was friendly and helpful. We'd highly recommend this one for a light meal."}
{"text":"I love this little café! The espresso drinks are on point. The muffins and pastries are amazing. Bonus: The staff is always friendly, no matter the time of day. The vibe and ambiance is very chill and relaxing. Perfect for a break from the cold or rain."}
{"text":"Excellent Illy lattes here, free WiFi, and just general cool vibes here! As a Montreal tourist, I was already expecting a little taste of France, but who knew that a tiny piece of Italy was here too! This place may look packed from the street, but there's quite a bit of seating inside, so it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Super petit café portugais en plein milieu du centre-ville idéal pour les rencontres de travail et les lunchs santé et juste un peu \"fancy.\" J'y ai pris un trio de salade et elles étaient toutes aussi bonnes les unes que les autres. J'y retournerais certainement pour essayer les sandwichs qui ont l'air aussi alléchants. Puisque j'y suis allée le lendemain de l'action de grâce, j'avais encore un fond de dinde dans l'estomac, donc l'option salade était parfaite. De plus, le service est extrêmement courtois et chaleureux. Arrivez tôt, faites des réservations ou bien prenez pour emporter."}
{"text":"A long time ago, my best friend & I chose to eat at Vasco da Gama on a whim, but kept coming back for the elegant decor, the simplicity & quality of the menu, & the general classy ambiance. The place is very attractive, narrow but long, with its high arches & scheme of Mediterranean colors. Take note: it's always crowded in here, with lots of fancy people... We even saw Helene Bourgeois-Leclerc once! The food is exposed in a counter in the back; they have a good selection of sandwiches, salads, some burgers, plus desserts, muffins, croissants & cookies. I personally like the gluten-free chocolate one: rich, a little bit crunchy, but still melts in your mouth. As to the food, I definitely recommend you get the trio of salads! 10,75$, always fresh & usually creative, comes with two little pieces of toasted bread = happy belly & guilt-free conscience. As a side note: they make a rather good latte."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast at while in downtown Montreal.
We had breakfast here every day during a stay with friends. We all loved everything!. Food is fresh and delicious. The fresh squeezed OJ was excellent and the croissants were super yummy.

Their omellete vege was fabulous too. Ant they have pastries galore.
Good , fast service but a little pricey.
You can eat al fresco or inside."}
{"text":"Awesome alfresco brunch. My last meal on my way out of Montreal, and well worth the stop. I had a an omelette with chorizo and cheese (the Vasco de Gama: think Portuguese food) with a white baguette and fresh fruit. Large cafe au lait was great: Ille coffee! I lucked out to have a beautiful day and an outdoor table. Would definitely do again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning we tried this place with my friend. Both of us liked it so much. Delicious food, fast  service, unique atmosphere. 
I've been in Lisbon 2 years ago and this place definitely reminded me Portugal.
I'm sure I'm coming back. 
Highly recommend place!!! 
5* from me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff willing to go over menu in English. Fantastic food I has the vegetarian sandwich and the pasta salad with chicken which I honestly would've eaten a bowl of on its own. My husband got the lamb sandwich which he did not like but I thought it was also fantaztic. Seating here seriously sucks though and just getting water seemed to be a hassle for some unknown reason. I would eat outside if you can reserve one of the three outdoor tables."}
{"text":"This is a place to go for the atmosphere. It's a great spot to catch up with a friend. Though the seats are not the most comfortable one so keep the chat under 30 mins :) however in the meantime you can enjoy some great desserts with an Americano. I'd recommend the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Warmy place, everything to wake up for the rest of the day( service with an ipad in waitress hand ..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Montreal and stayed nearby.  The cafe is exactly what we were looking for in the way of a nice cafe with really great pastries.  We sat down for a mid day cafe and dessert and were pointed to the 'Portuguese Surprise' dessert.  We were told that it had some lemon in it and 'some other things that you'll like'.  We were all having fun playing this game so we tried it.  Of course, we were told that if we didn't like it, it would not be held (or charged) against us.  Well, we couldn't have enjoyed it more. So much so that we returned a couple of days later for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I had an omlette with some spiced meat and chesse and my wife had a similar meal but as a wrap.  Absolutely wonderful meal.  The staff is super helpful and nice.  We recommend this place heartily."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's very expensive here!

This cafe impressed everyone I know. All my companions say \"Wow!!\" the moment they walk in. It's unexpected to find such a beautiful, upscale cafe in this area! And upscale is it ever!! Shot the prices way way up. Unfortunately the food is not fancy at all. It's just bistro food.

The tables near the door are not very comfortable because they are so close together. The seating there do not have backing so I stacked my winter jacket and my purse on my lap. I had to shuffle every time people walk by because the neighbouring table is not far from me.

The sandwich is good. They make fancy-looking coffee. The soup is good too! Originally gave this cafe 3 stars due to price, but I changed it to 4. The sandwiches and soup are indeed very good.

Total cost for sandwich, soup, and cookie: $20 + tip
Total cost for coffee and cookie: $10

This cafe is often full though! There is a TV at the back playing commercials?

Their cookies are from Cookie Stefanie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go for coffee or grab a bite for breakfast, lunch or early dinner. Their omlettes, burgers, salads and pastries are great! 

Every time I am there, I feel like i am in Europe. This place has a charm and keeps drawing locals and tourists. It's usually pretty packed. 

In the summer, they have a lovely terrasse on Peel. 

You will enjoy whatever you end up ordering!"}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 4 people for coffee during a rainy Friday, and was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and coffee as well as pastry choices. 

It started off a bit \"off\" as we were told upon entering that we might not be allowed to sit and just have coffee/pastries as it was 11:30am or so and they were waiting for the lunch crowd. Despite this, they checked and allowed us to sit and we ended up ordering cafés au lait, croissants and portuguese natas pastries. They were all excellent and although things are pricier and it's a more upscale area I will definitely be back. They get a bonus in my book for selling DOSE juice at the counter!"}
