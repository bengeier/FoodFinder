{"text":"this place changed from dragon bistro a year or so ago. not sure why. maybe ownership?   for a place that has a great address it is quite unremarkable.   by unremarkable I mean: the food is not just blah - its \"omg did I just pay that muchfor an appetizer that tastes like someone sprinkled cut tomato on a pita and call it brushetta' blah.  this place is dead. a couple of regulars staring wistfully into their beverages.   do yourself a favor and walk up the road to one of the other bars."}
{"text":"Been a regular here since Dragon Bistro. Love wing nights! Beautiful area and view too."}
{"text":"Planing Mill Sports Bar & Grill opens Nov 2013 in the location where Dragon Bistro used to be.  Nothing much had changed. Maybe in a good way for the regulars. Happy Hour on Weekdays from  4~6 pm for domestic draft (Canadian, Coors Light), Wine and Bar Rail Specials. Wednesday 2 for 1 Wings...  Menu is a little different but still the useful pub offerings.  Not a bad place for a quick drink with parking readily available but might not be the best choice if you  are on Unionville's Main Street."}
