{"text":"Love this place!! The food reminds me of Thanksgiving back home. So one thing that really stood out to me..I called to see if they had banana pudding. The lady answered and told me yeah. Cool..we head to the restaurant. About two minutes later I receive a call back and it's the lady from NaNas and she says, \"I'm so sorry to be calling..just wanted to let you know that I went to double check and were actually out of banana pudding right now. I didn't want you to drive all this way just to find out we didn't have it\". So this may seem pretty simple, but it was a big deal to me. She didn't have to call back - she was so nice and personable. We still ate there of course lol. I was too stuffed for desert anyway. But really friendly people, gave food suggestions and samples. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just left had my  money returned. Awful tasteless. cat fish , greens and peas. Dissapointed no soul in that food. Greasy fried way to hard. Service was indifferent and order was incorrect. Left as I arrived ,hungry."}
{"text":"I ate here on Wednesday when they have meatloaf because it's their special of the day and to  say I was disgusted would be an understatement. My meatloaf was pink. Ew"}
{"text":"Really good food, great place to go for a quick filling meal. Potions were large and the greens were a 10!"}
{"text":"I've visited Nana's on 2 separate occasions and I was highly disappointed with the food both times. I have tried the fried chicken, ribs, and fish and the chicken was pretty good but the ribs were covered in fat and the fish was greasy. Their side dishes are just disgusting. The mac and cheese had a soupy/watery consistency, not at all like \"home cooked' but more like easy mac or something. The mac and cheese was running into the other compartments in my take out container. The cabbage was tasteless and also sitting in a river of water in the container. They should really think about draining that excess liquid from their collards and cabbage because it doesn't taste good and it makes a mess of the food when the liquid slips into all of the other compartments in the container. My cornbread was ice cold like they had just pulled it out of the fridge. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for real \"southern comfort food\". If you're a fan of KFC or Bojangles then you will probably like this place. 
I actually visited a place called \"la'wans\"  on S. Tryon street near my house and their food is much better than Nana's. I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and potato salad from La'wans and it was the best  soul food that i've had in Charlotte so far. Their mac and cheese was DELICIOUS and exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend trying their food atleast once. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We are from Cleveland and there is nothing this good there.we split 2- 2 meat dinner and tried as many different things as we could.everything was some of the best I've had.each dish had a unique and distinct taste that was spot on and perfectly prepared.wish I could get my hands on these recipes."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The baked chicken is flavorful and moist! The section of sides are plentiful and I personally love the green beans and curry rice!"}
{"text":"Short, very short walk from Hyatt Place hotel. 
Food was cooked, hot, tasty and filling. Had one meat (baked chicken breast) and two sides (curried chicken rice and macaroni salad) and cornbread. 
The folks behind the counter were friendly and welcoming. 
Ya gotta try this place if in the area."}
{"text":"i just recently called to enquire about calories and the person who answered (a guy) was very rude. first he could not make a estimation about how much calories are in the plate. when i explained to him while talking politely make an estimation of how much calories was in a small plate vs. a large plate the person rudely hung up. he could have given me a number and it would have been all good but now i decided not to go there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome.  I have had the fried chicken, curry and meatloaf and they are all delicious!  All the sides are just as good and you can't beat the price.  This is definitely a place worthy of repeat business.  Lines can get long during lunch but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"I thought the food was just OK, but still pretty expensive.  For as casual as it was, I thought it would cost less."}
{"text":"The restaurant is set up with a single bar containing all the food and you tell the server what you would like.  For the main dish, they have fried chicken, grilled chicken, BBQ chicken, curry chicken, pork chops, ribs, fried fish, etc... For the sides, they have mac & cheese, collard greens, green beans, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, candied yams and so on.  You know, southern soul food.

The combos are the 1 meat and 2 veggies or 2 meats and 2 veggies (veggies meaning sides).  The combo comes with a drink and the choice of corn bread or a dinner roll.

I went for the 2 meats and chose curry chicken and fried chicken with a side of candied yams, macaroni and cheese, and corn bread.

Wow.

The curry chicken was melt of the bone delicious.  The fried chicken was finger licking good, and the mac and cheese....the mac and cheese was AWESOME.  

The candied yams were good too, but a little too sweet for me.  The rest of the dinner stole the show, though.  And I was too full to even eat the corn bread.  

My only regret is that I didn't (or couldn't) order dessert.  They probably had 12 kinds of cake and I wanted to order all of them.  Some of my coworkers ordered the red velvet cheesecake and they loved it.  I'm definitely getting some the next time I go.

5 stars.  Even if you go just for the mac and cheese, this place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Everything is great the fried chicken is the bomb the potato salad is on point and the red velvet cheesecake is to die for!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! The collards were spicy with a little sweet taste to them. Fried chicken was good!! Need more vegetable options!!"}
{"text":"Killin' time waiting for a flight and happened in here. Everything I ate was tasty, fresh and made me happy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food at Nana's.  I had the fried chicken and fried fish.  Both were cooked great to my liking.  Not too much seasoning (just right for me).  Sweet tea for my drink......and it was good.  Desert was the strawberry shortcake which I ate the next day and that too was cool.  Overall, I think it is a decent place to eat and to invite others out to enjoy some great soul food.  In all honesty, this was the first soul food place in Charlotte where I really enjoyed their food.  I would return."}
{"text":"My first visit to Nana's and I'm hooked! Service is cafeteria-style, so you can see exactly what you're choosing. I ordered the small plate, and the helpings were so large I still took food home with me. I had the scrumptious curry chicken, mac n cheese (so good) and rice stuffing. My, oh my, but it was good! My husband had fried chicken and collards with his meal, and I tried both. The chicken was juicy and crispy, and the collards were perfectly cooked. And the cornbread--YUM! 

Our meal was hot and delicious--real comfort food--and the service was fast and friendly. We ordered a to-go meal to take with us, and it was promptly prepared when we returned to the counter--no waiting. 

Nana's will now be a staple on my visits to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nana's! There are some things that I like about this restaurant and some things that I dont. The mac-n-cheese is usually to die for and the baked chicken is fantastic when its not dry. The candied yams are always super yummy too! Service is great and the employees are friendly.The only problem I have with this establishment is consistency. Sometimes the chicken is dry or the meatloaf doesn't taste the same. Every now and then the mac-n-cheese isnt so fabulous. Many of their food items are like this. This restaurant is touch and go when it comes to how well the food tastes. I wouldn't put Nana's at the top of my list but its definitely a decent place to stop by for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We happened into Nana's when our breakfast plans fell through! Wow- loved it. First, the guys that worked there were so nice and helpful. 

Second, fried chicken - moist, crunchy - - five stars!!!!

Mac and cheese - delish.  The yams - omg- the best!!!!!!

The corn bread wasn't so great . I gave them 4 stars because of the corn bread.

Oh - I forgot- nanna pudding. Happy happy!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. Fair. Chicken is bland, portions are skimpy, not generous. Price doesn't match portions. Cornbread muffin, very tiny. Greens are weird. I normally don't eat out due to reasons above and Today..I had hair in my meal. I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"First time visiting Nana's, let's just say they didn't disappoint! I'll be back again! Try the curry chicken ."}
{"text":"I was in the area two years ago for work, and was back today. Both times I ate at Nana's and both times have been beyond satisfied. Great fried chicken, mac and cheese, yams, mashed potatoes, desserts and more! Comfort foods at a fair price, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"This place was the best. I had a friend that needed a bite before jumping on the plane and we decided to stop here. The lunch buffet was perfect, fried chicken was delicious. The buffet choices are numerous and it's quick when needed. I will definitely bring more of my out of town guests here !"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Food is good, service was awesome and the place is spotless. I had the fried chicken, green and yams which were DELISH! Being from Cali, good soul food is hard to come by, but North Carolina scratched my itch. Husband had the fried chicken, cabbage and yams. We shared our sides and everything was good. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I decided to go here for lunch with a coworker yesterday (we have an hour for lunch and work 5 minutes away). I ordered the Catfish with two sides (mac & cheese and collard greens) with cornbread. The catfish is cooked when you order so I was told my food would be brought out to me. After waiting 15-20 minutes I ask about my order and was told the chef forgot to drop the catfish. I am told that I can have a free dessert and it would be brought out to me. I ask for a to go box because I figure at this point I will not be able to eat here and get back to work on time. I then get my food and instead of collard greens I have cabbage. I go to the counter to tell them of the mistake and the older woman that works out front proceeded to tell me that my ticket did not say collard greens and was so rude about my simple request which was to be given what I ordered and paid for. So I left with a to go box of catfish, collard greens, and mac & cheese. In addition I had cabbage and a desert (neither of which I wanted). And then to top it off, I realized after leaving that I never got my cornbread. All I can say is it will be a long time and I will have to have a desperate craving for soul food before I go back. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because the food is sooooo good. Nana's you need to step up your customer service."}
{"text":"Nana's food was fantastic!  And the variety was AMAZING!! The only thing that was missing (and why I didn't give 5 stars) is because they didn't have collards on the day that I went! Everything was so good and I felt like I was at grandma's!"}
{"text":"This was just a random stop for us before leaving back to Tallahassee. I have a hard time putting it into words just how much we LOVED the food here. I got the Catfish which was breaded perfectly and for my sides I got green beans, mac n cheese, and lima beans. All three sides were extremely yummy and out of all three I HIGHLY recommend the lima beans!! You get a TON of food for such a low price, all the food was hot and fresh (even for a cafeteria style joint which is hard to find sometimes) and the staff was friendly. I will be stopping here EVERYTIME I visit Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"We found this place after checking Yelp and Trip Advisor.  It really does live up to the great reviews.  Went on a Sunday evening at about 5:30 pm.  It was about a 15 minute wait but we are so glad we went.  We had a flight early the next morning so wanted something low key but good food.  The hardest part was deciding on the sides.  My husband had the catfish and I had the fried chicken.  It was incredibly great fried chicken:  another reviewer said crunch on outside but moist on inside.  But right mix of spices.  The catfish they fried per order so he had to wait a bit but it was worth it - large piece with great breading and cooked to perfection.  For sides, I had mac and cheese and stuffing with gravy.  My husband had cole slaw and cucumber and tomato salad.  Everything was so incredible.  I am not exaggerating, and tend to be discerning.  Had iced tea on the side, and brought owner's grandmother's recipe sweet potato pie back to hotel.  Was gorging on it at 8:30 that night bcs. was too full after dinner.  The owner made a point of asking of us if we liked the meal and what we liked about it.  This to me is what the perfect recipe for a great restaurant is:  great food, gracious employees,  and very happy customers.  Oh - and price-wise, very reasonable."}
{"text":"1st of all I was amazed that a 10 year old young girl is practically running this restaurant!! The food was delish and the service was even better!! Love that it's family owned and it's a great place to eat if you want to try a lil taste of the south. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Nana's is my go-to for soul food in Charlotte.  Much, much better than LaWans or Merts IMO.  Food is always fresh and flavorful!  Don't really care for the desserts as they don't seem all that homemade.  But then, I've only tried the cake and the sweet potato pie.  Usually get yams, cabbage, collard greens as my sides and either fried or baked chicken (or the chicken special) or fish.  These are consistently good!"}
{"text":"Are here twice.  Both times were great.  Friendly staff and good food, cheap and convenient."}
{"text":"Really nothing special. Mac n cheese was best thing I had and this place ain't cheap either"}
{"text":"Great big portions! Food is Great coming back very soon! 12.99 for 2 meats 2 sides & Drink! Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Looks good, but the food was so bland! I might as well have been eating grass! Meats were ok, but it takes no culinary skill at all to throw some chicken in grease. I threw away my lunch today. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Nana's Soul Food Kitchen is so great. This is the place I always ask my husband to take me to when he picks me up from the airport after a business trip. I typically get the baked chicken and mac and cheese. I've also had the collards, mashed potatoes and green beans and have enjoyed all of them. Is it the best soul food I've ever had? Nah. Does it hit the spot when you need fast comfort food? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Nana's is so good!! The first time I had Nana's was when I visited Charlotte about 6 months ago. My boyfriend and I ate there lunch and dinner during our visits. When I mentioned that we was going back to Charlotte my boyfriends eyes lit up and he was supper excited to eat Nana's again Cafeteria style soul food. I've had the meatloaf.. It was Yummy. Their pork chops are to die for!! And you can't go wrong with their fried chicken!! My boyfriend love the smothered chicken breasts!! What's crazy is that for it to be cafeteria style the food still has the fresh out the oven taste and and supper tender! Mac and cheese is delicious!! Cabbage isn't mushy. The cornbread muffin is okay nothing to brag about.. It's actually on the dried side!! Yams are good too!! The potato salad was to salty.. Then again I'm very picky with potato salad. The service has always been great!! I would have to say they are a little pricey but the food is so worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good home cooked meal, this is the place to be!! The large comes with double sides so be sure to come with an appetite."}
{"text":"The next best thing when your missing that down home cooking. Cornbread could be better but the food is great! Fried chicken & mac... yummy! Even my mom likes it!"}
{"text":"This is the best southern food we had on our trip to Charlotte!!
We had the pulled BBQ chicken and fried chicken. Extremely delicious, the chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy crust and tender insides.
Try the sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese for a heavenly dinner!
Turns out the guy sitting next to us was the owner Shawn.
Had to compliment him on the food !!!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Great food (home cookin') GREAT STAFF!!!!! Price is right too!!! Sweet Tea is good as well!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Our family enjoyed the fish catfish,  fried tilapia,  fried chicken,  macaroni and cheese,  green beans, yams, and pork chop. It was overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant for about 2yrs now. For a few months it was my Sunday spot. I saw them expand uptown and this is when I noticed a big change in the taste and it was not a good change. I stopped going for a long time then decided to give them another try. I go back because I try to support black owned businesses but the food here is not consistent, its hit or miss. I live outside Charlotte and I drove to get a dinner recently and got all the way home to find that one of my sides taste like it was out of a can and had NO seasoning. I called back and spoke to the manager and I was given a free side if I came back. I stopped after work today to pick it up and the server barely put anything in the container. This is the last time I will go there, mainly because the manager knew where I drove from and all you can do is give me a free side, that I may as well have not came back to get. In the future please consider those who keep you in business. You all messed up my meal plus inconvenienced me and you couldn't compensate with a full meal to replace the one that you all messed up. I burned gas twice coming there. I will not return again, I will go where I know the food will taste the same every time I go. I will stick to Lawan's...the best soul food in Charlotte. I hate to give this review but that was not handled properly. Any other business would have replaced the entire meal due to the inconvenience alone. When you know better, you do better!"}
{"text":"This place is overly priced,  and I did not find the food to be all that. Poor service and very slow.  Don't take a date there."}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious!! We found this based the yelp review and so glad we did. The food was fresh hot and great! The portions were large and they offer a lot of choices! Great southern style foods and wonderful sweet tea. Clean and large TV's. Will stop in again when visiting the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"Im a fan, i visited Nana's today for a New Years lunch and enjoyed every bite, Had black eyed peas, greens, mac and cheese, and smothered chop. It was great home cooking that I didnt have to cook. The smoothered chop was very tender, and all of the veggies were great. I will definitley be back again."}
{"text":"I frequent Nana's quite often for lunch due to my job location. The food is great, no argument there, but in my opinion the price point is too high for the meal served. I'm originally from Alabama where 'meat and three' joints (1 meat, 3 sides) are as abundant as most chain restaurants and a good lunch may run $8-9. However a similar meal at Nana's, or in this case a 'meat and 2' will run you $11. 
I'm not sure if this inflation is due to the restaurant being close to the airport or simply nestled among an up scale business district that drives the price. Whatever the case, pushing over the $10 mark for lunch is too much. In addition, adding another meat will run you $16. I guarantee that if there was a lunch special vs one flat rate regardless of meal then you would see an increase in foot traffic. Just my opinion. 

Bottom line: Good food, high cost"}
{"text":"I am glad that I discovered this gem of a restaurant.  The food is wonderful and my only regret with them was not finding them sooner.  I have not had a bad meal there yet, and I have tried just about everything they have.  They have wonderful selections and the portions are beyond generous in their size.  They're conveniently located and their service is friendly and speedy if you're there on your lunch break.  When you come to Nana's, you better come hungry and prepared for one of the best home cooked meals you can find in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by today and it was BOMB.com I had the BBQ chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens and corn bread. For dessert I had the peach cobbler. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Our hotel shuttle driver recommended this local eatery and it was very tasty. Met Shawn, the owner, and tried the catfish and jerk wings. Great favors...good NC find!"}
{"text":"This is a positive review. My family, all from out of town, of about eight people entered this neat, clean and brightly lit establishment. This was our first time and we all had a lot of questions. The staff handled the pressure while being polite and professional. The menu had various options to choose from, all with affordable prices. The food was tasty and sufficient we dined in and there was plenty of seating room. I would definitely choose to eat here again."}
{"text":"Bring epic hunger!  The portions are HUGE and the food is great!  Don't walk in thinking you are just gunna take some home for later cause you will eat it all either in the restaurant or at stoplights on your way home. I had the smothered pork chop and fried chicken with mashed potatoes and pinto beans. All was excellent! Surprisingly, they have a way with beans so don't go without."}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken, collard greens, and mac and cheese are to die for! Soul Food at a affordable price.  I have had eat in and take out and trust me its just as good when you take it home as well.  YES!"}
{"text":"I've been here on 2 different occasions since moving to Charlotte and I am overall pleased. It's a cafeteria line so to speak. You walk to the counter and the food is presented in an assembly line, the staff plates your food you just let them know what you want, first you choose your meat then you move on down the line to complete your other choices such as the side item, corn bread/roll, dessert and then finally you pay for your food and grab your drink. The seating area is clean and spacious, they have outside seating as well and there are 2 or 3 TV's mounted on the walls. The food is good, seasoned well (not salty) and the price isn't bad especially for the large portions you receive. Staff was cool we didn't have any issues that I can think of the only thing that annoyed me was the single restroom. The restaurant isn't huge but in my opinion any dine-in restaurant should have a multiple use restroom, at lease 2 stalls especially for women and children. I will def come again and recommend it to visitors."}
{"text":"Nana's is great, great soul food!

Second time being there on vacation.  We actually made it a part of our trip and point to make it there again.

Kind of a cafeteria style service. Great reception. BBQ chicken was the main meat, twice. Sauce is very mild but tasty. We choose Mac n cheese, baked beans, and the collard greens.  All of which are so mouth watering good, I can't even describe.  The collard greens are, dare I say, better than mom's.  The cornbread was a little dry, the tea, sweet.  All in all, a wonderful experience for a great price. Can't wait to visit the Charlotte area again and enjoy Nana's again!"}
{"text":"After many months of hearing reviews on Nana's, I finally decided to go since they are opening a new restaurant downtown near my job.  I wanted to see what I should expect if I would go there for my occasional need for soul food.  The restaurant situated in a small mall off the main street.  Cafeteria style service offerring good choices of meats and veggies.  I had to have the fried chicken.  It was simply so good.  the veggies...seasoned rice and green beans could use a little more seasoning.  I ordered cobbler for dessert that had to heated in the microwave.  I was expecting cobbler from a sizzling hot pan.  Ooops...did not happen.  I am looking forward to trying the new restaurant downtown Charlotte.  And hoping that the chicken be just as good as it was from the southern restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this spot after an attempt to find good soul food in Charlotte. I am glad we found this using Yelp. 

The restaurant had a good selection of entrees and sides. You choose your food cafeteria style and the seating and ambiance are very basic. Food is served on disposable plates, cups and flatware. 

The food was served hot and was well seasoned. I had the smothered chicken which tasted like I had cooked it at home. Crispy fried chicken in a flavorful gravy! The green beans were good although the mashed potatoes could have used some butter and salt. I did not try the desserts on this visit but they looked tempting. 

This is a spot that I will try again."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here tonight. 
We were staying at the Hyatt.
I'm originally from the south/east coast- but currently living in Seattle.
This food is legit!
Phenomenal 
I had a large plate (2 meats)
I shared with my son since he's only 1.
I had the fried chicken and baked chicken; coleslaw, yams and sweet tea.
So so good!!!
Originally the staff told me they were out of cornbread- I told him a regular roll was fine-but after I paid; he put some fresh cornbread in a box for me. Great customer service skills!

Awesome staff and the customers are nice too.
Man, I miss the south.
This place hit the spot for me!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch....

While working in Charlotte we stopped here to get food for our lunch break.  It's served \"cafeteria style\" and it came out hot and fast. There was a good crowd there and the staff is really cool.

I got the lunch special - meatloaf. It was a little heavy on the sauce but other than that it was pretty good. The sides were good too. I had the tea and it was good as well.

Yeah I'd come back."}
{"text":"My second time enjoying this delectable and wonderful taste to my palate. The food here is always fresh, and I did not know that they served fried fish and it is cooked when ordered. I ordered a fried piece of Tilapia with my meal and it was delicious!!! This is a place all need to give a try. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is restaurant is a DIAMOND in the city of Charlotte, NC and believe me it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"My only regret is that I did not save room for dessert- a mistake I will not make next time - and there will be a next time.  I splurged on fried chicken and it was worth the splurge.  Good greens - spicy and sweet, black eyed peas and corn bread. All the veggies looked good. My dining companion said the bbq chicken and pintos were good too. Only about 5-7 minutes off the interstate if you driving through and really close to the airport.  Next time, I have to try the sweet potato pie. 

Cafeteria style so it's pretty quick too."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, and the food is delicious (fall off the bone ribs, excellent collards, real cheese in the Mac and cheese) and the portions are generous. I may have a new favorite!

They would have gotten 5 stars, but they messed up my order. To their credit they were really nice about fixing it (but still forgot my cornbread)."}
{"text":"I have been to Nana's three times now and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys true southern cooking.  The selection is great, the food is prepared just like my Grandma would have made it and you will not leave hungry.  The portions are awesome.  I am possibly addicted to their collard greens!  I usually drown my greens in vinegar but haven't put one drop on my collards at Nana's.  They are delicious!  Slightly sweet and tangy.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  
The first time that I visited I had the pleasure of meeting the owner and was very impressed with his genuine desire to provide the best quality food for his customers and his pleasant personality.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only good food is grill pork. Don't buy fried chicken, KFC is doing better fried chicken that this restaurant."}
{"text":"NaNa's is NumNum's 
We first heard of this place from a radio ad and figured we would check it out as its out thought process that we should be able to find some of the BEST SOULFOOD in the South.

While NaNas was advertised as the superior SOULFOOD restaurant I would have to say it was Meh.. I personally have had much better and at a much better price. We have the best SOULFOOD restaurants in Chicago and I've had amazing in NYC. The theory is that most people migrate north from their southern states (Mississippi to Chicago, SC to NYC, etc.) which is why the soul food is so amazing. You would think that being in the South the SOULFOOD would be just as awesome from people from the South but that's not true.

Because I grew up with women making amazing SOULFOOD and I cook it amazingly so I'm a bit of a critic on how the food should be prepared and the overall taste. 

The chicken my husband had was fried crispy which is good but the meat was a little on the dry side. Yes he had white meat which is a dry portion of the chicken however there are ways to make white meat moister in the preparation technique. The mac n cheese was okay (not the best) and the collards were a bit sweet. The bread pudding was pre made and there wasn't an option to have it fresh and HOT with ice cream (BUMMER).

It's a place to try but I'll stick to cooking out SOULFOOD unless I find the perfect place that I can use as a go to once in a while when I don't feel like cooking and want a great soulful meal."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mexican restaurant but it was closed on Sundays.  We were glad it was.  Everything was delicious.  Favorites were curried rice, meatloaf and fried chicken.  Cheesecakes were amazing.  Collards were seasoned perfectly.  Definitely worth the drive off the interstate!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I got the Talapia which was made to order so it was nice and hot but it wasn't seasoned. The Mac n cheese was good and the greens were decent. LaWan's is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"My old job is near this place. Once a week, I found myself coming here for dinner. It's cheap and the staff is great. Good soul food indeed! The mac and cheese is to die for!"}
{"text":"Best soul food in the area! Was terrific! 
Both got large plates not realizing portions were big, so much food for the price! 
The server helping let us try a few samples to decide what to get, that's rare at most places. 
Fried tilapia 2 pieces, candied yams & curry rice all was great tasting and hot from the oven.
Bourbon chicken,  mac & cheese and cabbage very tasty as well. Ordered the fried catfish as 2nd meat on plate and it was huge!
Will return!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good I love their fried pork chops it's definitely pricey if I must say so myself the three times I ate here it was delicious I love their curry rice definitely one of my favorites it does seem like they cook with a lot of sugar but for the most part I'd recommend this place to friends and family seeing that Charlotte doesn't have a lot of soul-food restaurants I must say that this restaurant would have to be named if someone ask you about soul food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Posted review earlier...not sure if it posted.
Don't miss a chance to try the delicious food.
The 4 stars are for the price not matching cafeteria style restaurant serving food in styrofoam, however don't let it stop you from trying.  Plan for dessert!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here while staying in the area overnight waiting for a flight home.  In a word...EXCELLENT!  I ended up ordering way too much food, but I was able to try a variety of things.  It was awesome and well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I eat at Nana's often and the food is good. Today, I had the pulled barbecue chicken with collards and mac & cheese. It was tasty and the service has been fair to good for most of my visits. 

However, today I was very disappointed. When I arrived with my family, I noticed that plastic table cloths were being placed on ALL of the tables.  I asked the server if they were having a special event, in which she replied, \"They [guests] are, we [Nana's] aren't!\" 

I proceeded to ask if there would be anywhere for my family and I to sit. Another server chimed in and said \"Sure, outside.\" I was so agitated by the response that I almost left. But, since I had my grandmother with me, who had not eaten for hours, I opted to check the temperature outside. She wanted to stay.

Once I arrived outside, I noticed that the same party had reserved outdoor tables- by covering with plastic table cloths, with only a few available. I was confused. Then, on the way out after our meal, the large party that took over the establishment had the doors blocked- trying to place their INDIVIDUAL orders. We had to weave through a \"less than kind\" crowd to get out of the place. 

As a business owner myself, I consider it HIGHLY unprofessional to allow a party to reserve all of your tables, while remaining open to the public. Considering the dining space is small and not sufficient for private reservations, Nana's should have closed. It not only lacks taste but it also indicates a lack of control over your business. If it were not mild weather, Nana's would have lost 4 customers. In fact, as a result of this experience, I doubt I will frequent as often as before, as I consider the business ethics to be in poor taste."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the food, so was my husband and two kids! We had the fired chicken very juicy and it had great flavor. Everything was just wonderful.Both of my kids are very picky and they actually ate every bit of their food and enjoyed it. That's how you know it's good. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for and the kids enjoyed their cake the nice man at the register offered to them which was the strawberry icing cake! Definitely will be back! Also loved how the place was so clean and how everyone was friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things and bad things, and I've read reviews before going here. So, I decided to try them for lunch today. What a mistake! I purchased a baked chicken breast, mac & cheese, collard greens, and banana pudding....came w/ a cornbread muffin and a drink, so I got a bottle of water. The total was $16.32. In all fairness, the chicken was well cooked and tasted really good, but it was all down hill from there. The cornbread was decent but dry. The greens were barely cut up, had huge stems all in it, too sweet, and too salty at the same time. The mac & cheese looked and tasted like Kraft mac & cheese for the most part. The banana pudding wasn't homemade...tasted like it came from a box as well. I had high expectations for this place, but I was extremely disappointed! I grew up in the south and was taught to cook from scratch at a young age. This is not the place you want to go for that legit, \"grandma's soul food\" taste. I mean, you can go for the chicken...but at that price, I expected so much better than what I actually got! Smh..."}
{"text":"I wonder what others are eating when they call this food good!! I love to cook, I also love home comfort food. This is not what I was expecting. This is for those on the go and never get a home cooked Sunday thru Thursday meal. I got dessert bc I promised myself never to try the food again. The dessert is 4.50 a slice and nothing is homemade. Everything taste commercial. At least you should try out the best cakes in the grocery store or your local wearhouse, publics would taste better I think. A store bought cake cut up and sold. I hope the owner reads this, you should be ashamed to put a sign up. Give your customers the best. They will stick by your business. You have lost 3 on this day. I want my 14.00 back."}
{"text":"This place has great southern food with lots of choices.  The staff is friendly and quick.  Everything I have tried is awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped here when visiting Charlotte.  This restaurant serves soul food in a cafeteria style setting, with several meat and sides options. Was feeding a few people so I was able to try a bunch of their food items.  I tried the fried chicken, smothered pork chops, meat loaf, cabbage, lima beans, mac and cheese, and banana pudding. The fried chicken was very good. Actually wish I didnt have to share it bc I'd have preferred it to the other meats. If I came back I probably wouldn't get the smothered pork chops again. The meat loaf was pretty good  but not better than that fried chicken!!! The cabbage could've been cooked a little longer, in my opinion, but the other sides were very tasty! 

A small meal comes with 1 meat, 2 sides, a drink, and a roll/corn bread for about $10-11. A large meal comes with 2 meats, 2 larger sides,  a roll/cornbread, and a drink for about $16-17. The employees were extremely friendly and helpful. If I'm ever in this area again, I would definitely return (I'd skip the banana pudding tho)!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Very well seasoned and nice portion. I was very pleased with the service. I found this location via Yelp and I'm not disappointed. I will visit again. Very clean and nice place."}
{"text":"I had some girlfriends in town for the weekend and by Sunday afternoon we had no food left in my house and we were starving. I'd been to Nana's before and just casually offered it up as a suggestion, as soon as my friends heard \"soul food\"....they practically knocked me over to get to the car. 

When we arrived the place was packed! This was a great sign! My friends and I had plenty of time to look at the menu and see what we wanted....not to mention this place smells amazing as soon as you walk in the door.

I went with the smothered pork chops, cabbage and pinto beans and rice. My mouth is still watering from how good this meal was....the chop was so tender and the gravy has such great flavor, the cabbage has just the right about of crisp in each bite and the rice and beans were classic. 

YUM!!! 

Needless to say, I know exactly where I'll be going when I'm craving an excellent, finger licking, sleep is bound to take over my body soul food meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nana's several times and each time I've never been disappointed! Great food and a great staff!"}
{"text":"I find it hard to rate the food (which looked good from where I was standing in the cafeteria line) because when I heard the server tell the woman ahead of me that there would be a wait on the white meat chicken I just left. This place is impossible to find because if you google the address on their site it will take you to some random street with a similar name. So when I called to get directions I was told the street has not been built yet so they use another address. Once I finally found the place it was located in the same building as a basketball facility & you might as well have been sitting center court because it was VERY loud & half the wall was open to the basketball game. It was like eating in the bleachers of a sports facility. I'm sure the food is great, based on reviews, but I will never know. This is the WORST place to have a restaurant that I could ever imagine. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was on town for a brief stay. I wanted to patronize a local business. Nana's came up on Yelp. Being somewhat of a germaphobe, I was thrilled with their health score. This is where I stopped being thrilled. The staff was polite. I ordered a small plate ( 1 meat and 2 sides). I opted for 2 fried chicken legs, Macaroni and Cheese, and Stuffing. The chicken was good but the sides were generic and lacked seasoning.  I also bought dessert....uhhhhh. The cheesecake was waxy and just not good. I really have to start baking again. Any who, I would go back to try different options on the menu."}
{"text":"Today was my third time eating at Nanas and my husband's first. A MS native, his go to for delicious catfish and soul food has been Stephanie's in Greensboro. After today, Nana's is our family favorite. We ordered the catfish which is cooked to order. The bourbon chicken, pork ribs, greens, yams, and mac&cheese were also amazing!! The staff is friendly and line went by fairly quick for an after church crowd.

The food was so amazing I knew the only way I could show appreciation was by writing a review."}
{"text":"This spot is simply amazing!!! Where do I start the fired chicken was crispy & season to perfection & juicy the mac n cheese was cheesy just how I like it the yams was good & not can out the store"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. The special today is Bourbon chicken - it's delicious. Everyone is so nice - Kymbra made several recommendations to me and let me sample some veggies. The potatoes, greens, and green beans are full of flavor. The meat falls off the bone. So glad to have been referred here for some excellent dining!"}
{"text":"I love Soul Food, so when a few co-workers told me to check out Nana's on my trip out to Charlotte, NC....well I took their advice and checked it out. I am glad that I did.

This place is situated in small plaza. We came here for lunch a couple of times and was always pleased with the food and the service!  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  On my two visits to Nana's I ordered the following items (Combination of my two visits of course!):

-Fried Chicken (So Crispy and Juicy, not dry)
-Pork Chop (Tender and seasoned right)
-Baked Beans (Delicious, but a bit sweet for my taste)
-Collard Greens (Cooked to perfection)
-Mac and Cheese (Cheesy Goodness)
-Yams (Sweet but a bit oily)
-Red Velvet Cake (Was a little on the dry side)
-Banana Pudding (LOVED THIS!)

The portions they give you are pretty big, and their pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I've been out to Charlotte twice now and made it a point to hit up Nana's on both trips. I will continue to hit up Nana's on my trips out to Charlotte going forward. To sum it up, good food delivered by good people."}
{"text":"Macaroni and cheese is my favorite. The macaroni and cheese is not the typical homemade, baked mac. It actually was disgusting and I didn't eat it..at all. The yams were good but too sweet and syrupy so I didn't finish them. The strawberry cake wasn't good either. The fried chicken wings were okay with hot sauce."}
{"text":"I LOVE NANA'S! Portions are always huge and the food is delicious. Staff are friendly and efficient. Prices seem reasonable to me - meals include a beverage and again the portions are so big it's like you get two meals in one!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. Cafeteria style service. You can see your food bf you order it! If you like chicken you'll find it here. Good soul food!"}
{"text":"Ordered here with Postmates for the first time tonight. Paid more for extra meat and did not get it. Called the restaurant and the manager told me there was nothing she could do. The catfish did not come with sauce and was boring and bland. The mac and cheese and collards were also unseasoned and not flavorful. I overpaid for a incomplete, uneaten meal. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious. This was our first visit. The meat that I ordered was not cooked so It was cooked soon afterwards. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating the Greatest Banna Pudding I have ever had. Wow, very flavorful. First time here and I will remember it forever. Fried chicken is how it should be crunchy on the outside and juicy in the inside. I had Mac and cheese and rice with gravy. I love eating at places where you do not have to add salt. Cheesy, cheesy Mac. Rice done perfect and gravy seasoned right..... Nanas has my stamp of approval. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok I came to town for training and saw this place voted the best in Charlotte. I went in and ordered I'm a foodie. I wanted Mac n cheese they ran out. The cook said its in the oven I asked how long so I could wait. No answer. They put this undone Mac n cheese on my plate I am horrified. This is the worse Mac n cheese ever. I as a business owner would prefer you talk mess about me running out than to serve some undone food. Overall the rice was nasty the gravy bland. Baked chicken good yams were awesome stuffing good couldn't tell what type of BBQ I was eating asked for chicken and it was cut up in small pieces I'll pass. Desert red velvet cheesecake. I spent 25.00 should be 10.00 never again."}
{"text":"I fell for the hype!!!!  

I expected something a little different being in the south and all. 

I thought I was in the middle of a sugar hill song.  You know the one, the part, have you ever been to a friend's house to eat...the mac is all soggy :)

The only redeeming quality from my plate was the crispy, well marinated,  chicken breast.

My plate, shared with my daughter:  breast, ribs, greens, mac/cheese, bbq beans, and diet coke.  $20 plus. 

The ribs seemed to be boiled then slathered with sauce.  

The greens were sweet (is this a north carolina thing?)

The mac/cheese was soggy.

The beans were ok.

Everything was trashed except for the chicken and coke. 

I wanted to like this place. Maybe I went on the wrong day, at the wrong time. 

I'm done with NC this year :)"}
{"text":"For lunch today had the fried catfish, green beans, yams and cheesecake. The catfish was way too salty, and I love salt, and it wasn't crisp. The breading actually just tore when I tried to cut it instead of being able to cut it. Sides were good. The fried chicken looked good so I probably should have ordered that instead. The cheesecake seemed old and tasted like playdough, only took 2 bites and trashed it. The staff was pretty friendly and nice looking place."}
{"text":"Damn. Damn. Damn! This place is soooo good. My wife and I tried this place while in town for a soccer tournament. Going back again TODAY! Mac and cheese, candied yams, chicken(fried and smothered) fish....I can't wait until 11:00 to get it to go and head back to Georgia."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with my food @ Nana's. Food is always seasoned well and very tasty.  Pretty good value also.  Ribs are great!  Fried chicken, bbq chicken, corn bread, collard greens and yams are all very good.  Mac n cheese is just okay (reason for only 4 stars.)  I go to Nana's at least 2-3 times a month!"}
{"text":"Good Down Home Food. Just a little less pepper in the green beans would be great but definitely a place I would visit again during my visit(s) to Charlotte."}
{"text":"1. Best fried chicken ever!
2. Sweet potatoes and greens were great.
3. Sweet tea was good but not as good as Bo jangles.  

4. Red velvet cake- so so. 
5. Not cheap tho. 

Friendly staff.  Most defiantly will return."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good on a Sunday morning *four star*

Services was meh. *two stars*
-The staff was not engaged and while serving food to the table the staff member states \" I don't know who ordered what\" and just placed the food down and walked away. There was no \" can I get you anything else.\" Very unprofessional

Food needs lots of work. The best part of the food were the side dishes. *two stars* 

- Fried chicken was very bland. 
- Baked chicken was bland and looked under cooked once opened up. Not edible. 
- Fried fish needed more seasoning added as well. 
- cornbread was very dense and dry. (I should of gotten the store bought rolls they were serving)

 -Mac and Cheese: I only had a sample and it was bland and tasted like velveeta cheese. It did not taste like home made southern Mac and cheese. 

Some good news:

- the collards, green beans, yams, dressing were very good. *four stars*

**FYI: ANYTIME YOU SEE EMPLOYEES EATING POPEYES IN A SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT MIGHT BE AN INDICATION THAT THEIR FRIED CHICKEN IS NOT THE BEST. **

They might want to think about adjusting and reevaluating their menu. I PROBABLY WOULD NOT GO BACK TO NANAs."}
{"text":"I was working in this area and decided to try it out.  Excellent customer service from staff! There are a wide variety of meats, vegetables and desserts to choose from. They had chicken in every style you can think of... Fried, baked, bbq, jerk, Alfredo, etc. I went with the meatloaf which was the special of the day. My sides were Mac and cheese, candied yams, and cabbage. The meal comes with two sides but everything look soooo good that I gladly paid extra for third veggie. Then I couldn't resist getting a peach cobbler. My only concern is that all desserts were refrigerated...I like my cobbler served hot!! I heated it up once I got home and it was awesome!! This is definitely one of the best soul food restaurants I have visited in the Charlotte area.  Very clean seating area and bathrooms. Patio seating also available."}
{"text":"Best southern cooking I have had in a while, baked chicken with stuffing and mashed potatoes was yummy! It is definitely not for the health conscious."}
{"text":"I stopped here because I am celiac and figured it's worth a shot from all the good reviews. I chose baked chicken green beans and pinto beans. It's very good. I would recommend trying this place if you haven't. Very good food and a lot of choices. 
Nice atmosphere too. Plenty of seating even when crowded."}
{"text":"I had fried chicken, collard greens and yams.  The collard greens were excellent, I very much enjoyed them.  The fried chicken was fine, but not extra ordinary. The yams were OK.  Service was OK, but keep in mind it's pretty much a cafeteria line, so adjust your expectations accordingly.  The place does a big take-out business.

I walked over from the Renaissance Charlotte Suites Hotel.  It's pleasant 10-12 minute walk. It was a good option for getting out of eating hotel conference food for three days.

I would go back."}
{"text":"This place right here is good!! The staff is always friendly & greeting customers with a smile!!! 
My favorites are the fried catfish,greens, yams & mac & cheese!!& 2nd fav is that smothered chicken with dark gravy & dressing.. this place is a winner here in Charlotte NC!"}
{"text":"I will keep this short. Food is decent. Not your momma's cooking but it will do for a soul food craving. Staff always have an attitude. I mean they could at least smile once."}
{"text":"If you're starving and can't wait to eat than this is the place for you! If you understand food chemistry, your taste buds, and the excitement to inhale your food than this is NOT the place. 

Let's start off and say this is not soul food! Soul food has spice, sass, a little rhythm that makes you want to tap your feet, and overall just too damn good. 

This food taste like it came out of a box and can. My mac and cheese taste like garlic and cheese wiz, my fish had no flavor whatsoever. Taste like it came out the box dipped in batter and fried. My greens tasted like it sat in a bowl of vinegar and my yams of course we're candied. 
For 10.49 a pop I would at least like my fish to be well seasoned. I'm from Philly and majority our soul food spots season their food well and I'm shocked that I'm down south and this food taste like a northern just opened a new restaurant.  Don't get me wrong it wasn't nasty but it wasn't delicious either. It was ok! Try and do better. Change your chief. From the reviews everyone hates the Mac and cheese and I have to agree"}
{"text":"I had the smothered chicken with mac and cheese and green beans.I can say it was worth the drive from Balyntyne suburbs to get some good ole southern cooking. i got there at 11:30am on a Wednesday... the lunch crowd has not even came in yet so I was 1 of the first customers I gave it a 3.5  star wish could have given it a 4 star mainly the it was too pricey for the amount of food given... A fair price for that plate should have been $7 tops.. I paid $10 an didnt get a drink with it.. Don't think I will be visiting this place anytime soon.."}
{"text":"It's ok, I guess, but I found it to be overpriced considering what you get.  This place charges sit down restaurant prices in what is effectively a southern style chow line."}
{"text":"It was OK. Don't think I would eat here again since the only thing I liked was the pulled BBQ chicken and the corn bread. Mac and cheese was bland and the ribs needed more Seasoning. The service was great though and they let you taste test first."}
{"text":"Tons of hype, food and disappointment.  Jerk chicken was cold and soggy, ribs were flavorless mush and cornbread was hard as a rock.  Mac and cheese and curried rice were good but overall I'm baffled as to how this place has racked up so many awards."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to get some soullllll food. The food was great as usual.  Definitely will be back when I'm in town again. I was upset about not having rolls...everyone do not eat corn bread! $$ :("}
{"text":"Flying back north tonight and knew I needed to get my fix. Don't know anything about Charlotte at all, and just happened to be staying at a hotel right next to Nana's. Generally I'll check out what fellow yelpers have to say before I pop in somewhere, but I was starving and short on time. So, flying blind, I popped into Nana's for a late lunch. 

A few people were in there eating but no line and no crowd. Order on the left with the pleasant staff manning the delicious heaps of food, and after you've got your meal you head to your seating area. I ended up getting the small lunch plate with fried chicken, collards and black eyed peas. Of course with some cornbread on the side. The chicken was crisp and flavorful on the outside, and perfectly juicy on the inside. Tons of flavor and meatiness in the collards, and the black eyed peas were cooked well too. Big fan. They asked when I checked out if I wanted to get dessert...I now regret saying no!

Since I have no idea when the next time I'll be in Charlotte is, please go eat here for me. And don't skip dessert."}
{"text":"I remember visiting this place shortly after they first opened and they offered samples of whatever you wanted to try and my personal test for a legitimate soul food spot is the Mac n cheese, right?  Well I left the restaurant after that sample...now a year later I returned with a few friends for brunch and I will say that the smothered pork chops and potatoes were pretty good....the greens weren't to my liking but edible.  Because  I gave up pasta for Lent I wasn't able to test the Mac n cheese to see if perhaps it has been corrected but it certainly doesn't look much better...so the jury is still out until after Easter:-)"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Charleston, NC. When arriving to my hotel i glanced at the name of the restaurant and didn't really think that I would be dining there during my stay.  I was recommended to visiti another restaurant. I'm glad that I came to Nana's! The food is phenomenal!! If you enjoy eating home cooked soul food, Nana's is the place to visit!

The only suggestions I would make is that corn muffins would be amazing served warm, and display picture of the available option so the guest do not exhaust the great customer service with a million question"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hyatt over the weekend and used Yelp to see what was nearby. Nana's was the first on the list and sounded good. Arrived around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and the place was full...which is always a good sign. We were both hungry so ordered large plates which was two meats and two sides. I seriously have never seen such large portions in my life! I got the bourbon chicken and fried chicken with black eyed peas and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had! Boyfriend got the curry chicken and ribs with potato salad and greens. I don't eat greens but he said they were amazing. Every single thing we ordered was delicious. We had so much food left over that we left with two take out containers and stuffed. Will definitely visit again if I'm in this area."}
{"text":"We are here at an overnight stay in Charlotte. The food was delicious, the staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. Fried chicken and Mac and cheese were really great. Definitely recommend a stop at Nana's."}
{"text":"Great customer service, fast, and most importantly some delicious food. Macaroni and cheese was to die for and chicken was on point. Great location for all those working in the nearby business district. Perfect option for those wanting a quick lunch to sit down while having great food."}
{"text":"A few co-workers of mine have raved about this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered Chicken with 2 sides and asked for 2 extra sides. Order then came out to over $16 which I thought was ridiculous. I could have gone to Bojangles or KFC and fed my whole family of three for that price. Everything was good. Greens were too salty. Food is great but the price is too much if you want to add extra sides."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten so much food you just want to get up and do a victory lap around the dining room... Like you accomplished something?

If not, this is the place to go. 

Big bold flavors. No skimping on the salt. Easily more calories and I've eaten all week. 

The highlight for me where the collard greens. They tasted like a ham hock gave up its life to make that dish possible. 

I was thinking that the barbecue ribs would be bone in ribs but they're not. 

Also, I was thinking that the barbecue sauce might've been a bit watered down or 'thin'. 

Despite these minor things, I would recommend checking out these authentic 'Down South' Flavors. 

This is easily my shortest food review, but I think it's because I'm about to pass out."}
{"text":"A-maz-ing Southern Cooking. 

Fantastic variety. Every day feels like Sunday dinner here."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the times on Yelp. They're open until 9 PM on Sunday's. That's right folks! Got the munchies for a home cooked meal? Don't feel like cooking on Sunday and it's getting kind of late? Tired of fast food? Well drive on down to Nana's... She'll take care of you! 

I had some of my husbands one night. We were in a hotel for a few nights because of... well that doesn't matter, but let me just say that I wasn't raised on this kind of food BUT that doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to food period. 

I LOOOOOOOVVVVEEEE cheese! Who doesn't.. unless they're lactose intolerant. Mac and cheese is on point and the greens and stuffing are as well. I'm a side dish chick.

I'm salivating as I type this... 

I can't cook like this, but my final thought is Nana's puts Suge Avery pee in it... that's how good it is."}
{"text":"I thought it was expensive for what you got. Sweet potatoes and mac and cheese were good. Ribs almost entirely fat and gristle. I cannot imagine where they find such tiny chickens! Servers were very nice."}
{"text":"Great food when you are on the go will definitely stop in when I am back in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down one of my favorite spots to go to during my lunch break. Everybody is friendly and their food is delicious. And their meatloaf that they serve on Wednesday's? Absolutely to die for. Check this place out if you want amazing soul food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic soul food this definitely not the place. Burn mac & cheese, no flavor smash potatoes. I was expecting more since it has such \"great\" reviews."}
{"text":"My husband talks about this place ALL the time! So on Presidents' Day I decided to check it out with him.
You can either pick one meat and two sides or two meats and two sides. You also can choose between corn bread or roll and if you choose roll your drink is for free.
I was impressed with the number of sides and meat they had, besides the special of the day.
I had ribs with green beans and curried chicken rice and my husband had smothered chicken with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. The food was AMAZING! 
I tried my husband's mashed potatoes and I fell in love! 
My food was great too, the green beans were my favorite.
Nana's definitely will be on my list of restaurants to go back."}
{"text":"I got stuck someone to the office on this rainy gloomy day so what seemed better than grabbing some legit soul food? I had heard people at my office mention this place a million times and finally decided up check it out. 

Holy dang! This food is delicious. I went for the standard BBQ chicken and had the Mac and Cheese and collards for my sides( oh and cornbread!) The BBQ chicken is so juicy and dripping in sauce, the Mac and cheese is thick and cheesy and the collards are crispy but have a little kick to them. I ate this all in ten mins flat and their \" small\" meal is is anything but small but I couldn't put my fork down. 

I'm going to have to start doubling up on trips to the gym because there are many more things I want to try here but the extra trips to the gym will be worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  love it
You will enjoy the food,  great daily specials
The tea is great too,  had the bourbon chicken, loved it"}
{"text":"My first time here, but being from deep east Texas this place reminds me of home. God the black-eyed peas and collard greens are delicious and staff is so nice and professional and the owner is so nice she is a great person."}
{"text":"From all the reviews I decided to give this place a try the service was quick and staff w as friendly. Had the smothered pork chops macaroni and cheese and greens.  It wasn't what I expected the mac and cheese was definitely not what I expected. The best thing out the deal was the cornbread and sweet potato pie"}
{"text":"The more I go here the more I regret going. I think the food is very much so not worth the price. Today my food wasn't hot. And the quality of the food shouldn't be called soul food. Cornbread was COLD. Like it came out the refrigerator. This will be my last time going sadly to say."}
{"text":"While I wasn't too pleased with the portions..the food was good. Considering the competition in the area I would rather eat NaNas. Would I return? Yes, but hopefully they will adjust their pricey menu to reflect portion size. They serve you cafeteria style off hot buffet."}
{"text":"Three Important Things to Know:
1. Mac & Cheese - Top Ranked in Charlotte
2. Save room for a nap
3. Portions are large, wear sweatpants


Location: 3/5
Nana's is tucked away in a strip mall off of Tyvola. There's a good amount of corporate offices around it but if you don't work in the area, you've wouldn't know about this awesome restaurant. At least that's what I would think. The customer flow is pretty consistent though so news good cuisine must travel far.

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5
I've honestly never dined-in. I usually grab it on the way home or on Sunday when I'm looking for a home cooked meal. The facilities are clean and reminiscent of a fast food place so don't bring a date here with the expectations of candle lights and nice silverware. I opt for take-out also because this grub will give you the \"itis\"  aka a food coma if you eat enough. Good luck with that self control too if you think you can stop.

Cleanliness: 4/5
See above.

Service: 5/5
The servers are nice and welcoming. They're not shy with their portions either. You won't have that \"Chipotle\" look of disdain on your face. You know that look! The look you get when the guy at Chipotle gives you a third of a scoop of protein. 

Food: 5/5
It's so effin' good. If I'm every missing home or my mommy, I go to NaNa's ... then I drift into a slow, quiet sleep. Then i wake up and help myself to a second helping. Don't judge me. Everything is full of flavor so yeah ... that self control. My go to is the large plate: ribs, baked chicken, double Mac & Cheese. Nom. Nom. Nom."}
{"text":"OMGee !!! When I say I've ate this 3 days this week I really do mean it ! Nana's is absolutely amazing for soul food and I'm never disappointed ! I wish I could have Nana's in my kitchen everyday ! I would recommend anyone that is looking for a down to earth soul food place or just want something that's going to what we call \" STICK TO YOUR RIBS \" place, Go To Nana's NOW !!! Hurry before they close !!!!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to put some south in the mouth and gave a shot to Nana's.  Glad we did, food was good, various items to choose, place was clean and tidy, prices are ok though, felt a tad expensive for what we get.
To me it felt like it was just another southern food joint and not something that's exceptional.  Of course the good was good, fried chicken was nice, cabbage was good, corn bread was alright , beans was ok.  Having spoiled my Mert's I was not completely sold by Nana's but hey its one of the few authentic southern food joints.  So definitely a place that would remain in the  memory."}
{"text":"Yay for another restaurant close to the office.  I am a Yankee but I love soul food and southern cooking when done properly.  Nana's does it properly.  The employees are super friendly and the space is a step up from a cafeteria environment.  I had baked chicken which was 2 huge pieces, , mac and cheese, cabbage, and a slice of cornbread for $12.  That is why the star is deducted - prices are high, even for the quality of food and the amount.  I used a Living Social $10 takeout promo for this, but there is no way I would pay $12 for what I received."}
{"text":"Yo this place is sooooooooooo friggin good. I've never eaten at a place and wanted to give it more then 5 stars. NEVER! I will never be able to eat soul food again if it's not this good. Set the bar really high for my taste buds. 
I'm here visiting from Chicago. I stayed at the Hyatt Place across the street. Thank God for Yelp! That is how I found this place. I told my husband we must try when I saw the yelp reviews. 
We ordered the fried cat fish. They make it fresh when you order. It took a really long time to cook but beyond worth it. Very flavorful. We also ordered the fried chicken. It was really good too. For the sides we had the yams, Mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. All were finger licking good. My kids ate with us. They loved mac and cheese and yams as well. 
I'm kind of sad I don't live here but glad too. I guarantee you I would be fat if I lived in charlotte. I would eat here everyday. If i lived here I'd go to the gym twice a day though just to smash this place on the regular."}
{"text":"Best southern cooking around!  Make sure you try the smothered pork chop and fried chicken.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I just may have found my favorite Soul Food restaurant!  In Charlotte for the night, I Yelp'd to find Nana's and it was directly across the street from my hotel, so it couldn't be more convenient!  I actually downloaded the menu prior to going so I knew what I wanted:  Meatloaf, catfish, collard greens, and mac & cheese!  And this is just what I ordered!  Everything was so delicious that I only wish I was able to eat it the next day because I couldn't finish what was on my plate!

Craving Soul Food?  Nana's satisfies!"}
{"text":"No trip to Charlotte is complete without a stop at Nana's.  Fantastic soul food restaurant...everything they have to offer is great, and the prices are very reasonable.  All the staff is always very friendly and helpful, and the service is fast!  Everything on the menu is good...you choose two meats and then a generous portion of sides (try the Mac and Cheese!)...

If you're looking for some real good food that's filling and not pricey, Nana's is THE place to go."}
{"text":"So im visiting Charlotte this weekend....the one weekend a snow storm hitting. Noone was delivering to my hotel and the room service at my hotel was always busy. I looked online and saw Nanas was across my hotel. I called and was so relieved they were open. I walked over and when I walked in I was immediately greeted and a female asked if I have ever been there before. I said no and she took the time to explain the menu and the choices of sides. I ordered a large plate (2meats and 2 sides with cornbread) plus two extra sides bc I couldn't choose. I chose BBQ chicken, curry chicken, greens, Mac and cheese, yams and stuffing. I got cornbread and a drink included. I also saw desserts and again she was so nice to list to me what they had: I settled on red velvet cheesecake. I've tasted everything here so far and I feel like a grandma found me, made me dinner and fed me. This stuff is SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I'm in love with everything. These greens are LIFE and the yams and Mac and cheese are glorious. I wish they had a place like this in Miami where I'm from. Omg.....do yourself a favor and go here! Sweet tea taste homemade and yummy. I might faint from joy once I get to dessert."}
{"text":"This is some of the worst \"soul\" food I have ever eaten. The Mac and cheese was mushy and taste like processed cheese was used in it. The collard greens had just as many stems as leaves. The stuffing is not southern at ALL. It was stovetop stuffing with gravy on it. The only descent thing we ordered was the fried chicken however the white only comes with a breast. 

Not going to try this place again as it's some northern version of \"soul\" food that is not good. 

#SouthernersEatDressing"}
{"text":"I haven't been in Charlotte for a few years, but when someone asked me to name off some good restaurants in the area, this place instantly came to mind! It's been awhile, but you never forget how a place makes you feel. The staff here is very kind and patient as I navigated all their different options. They give huge portions and always left me enough to fly back home to my husband. My favorites were the mac n cheese and crispy fried chicken. Their banana pudding with Nilla wafers was always something I had to take home as well. If you're staying at one of the nearby hotels and want to avoid bland hotel food, this is the place to hit up!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the staff in the serving line is rude and impatient.  After experiencing this twice its enough to not go back.  Rudeness is never acceptable when dealing with the public."}
{"text":"Great food! Cafeteria style. Little pricy , but everything tasted like I was at grandmas! Worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"Service (if that is important to you) is Polite, Efficient and fast, Fast, FAST!!!  Seems they know some diners will be on a time schedule... I like Fast.  The Young Man who served me showed me everything and was very quick with words and actions (it is like a cafeteria line - you walk through and you can see the food before you order)...

Collard Greens these were EXCELLENT!  5 yelp stars

Corn Bread (better than La Wan's. Not as good as Mert's) 3.65 stars

Mac and Cheese 3 stars good though not any better than just good.

Plenty of Meats to choose from, though I chose none, the Fried Chicken was the only one that looked good... Do I really Like Soul Food?  I LOVE Mert's, though am I expecting something Gourmet from a Restaurant that is not pretending to be... The Collards were plenty Flavorful, this place may be more Authentic than I am used too.

Three TV screens (and one playing the X Games [YES!!!])The whole set up is comfortable, the ordering line is blocked from the dinning area so you have a more peaceful meal than if you had to listen to someone like me who could have held up the line (if anyone were behind me) saying \"give me one of those Cookies\" the server says \"ah, sir that is a Chicken Fried Steak\"... They treated me as if they knew I was reviewing them... They did their BEST!!!  Service Team seems well trained on Politeness and Speed!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good soul food head over to Nana's! My husband and I ate lunch there today and we're pleased! He had the fried chicken, cabbage, mac and cheese. I had the smoked pork chop, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes! It was good! The food was fresh and the place was clean what more can u ask for!!"}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte overnight to catch a flight back to California in the morning.  We were staying at the Hyatt place and w no car we walked across the street to place w a few different restaurants.  The wonderful smell from Nanas drew us in.  The staff was so super friendly - that nice southern charm we miss so much living on the west coast.  We were welcomed in and we were studying the huge menu options when a young man said\" just step up here and I'll explain everything to you\" and he even offered us samples.  I had baked chicken and catfish w greens and mac n cheese.  The greens were excellent.  Not bitter at all.  The mac n cheese was so yummy.  My hubs had the fried chicken n ribs- excellent.  I could go on and on. Great place.  Go here!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best southern cooking I've ever had! A group of three of us went and all got different things, and we all left super happy! I will be coming here every time in pass through Charlotte."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was on point. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The curry rice was the bomb! The greens were ok, a little sweeter than I prefer. The cornbread muffin was ok, would have been good if served warm. The cobbler wasn't good to me. I'll go back for the chicken and the rice and to try some other sides and desserts."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this food. It was fresh, fast, flavorful and filling. If you enjoy soul food, you have to try Nana's. I know I'll be returning for another meal while I'm still in town."}
{"text":"The food was really good, the fried chicken is top 3 I have ever had. Order choices were a bit confusing. Potato salad and corn bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte on business. I found this place on my way to my hotel.

Had a the large plate with fried chicken breasts and max and cheese. It was really really good. The chicken was crispy and juicy with a great flavor.

Good price as well.

The service was a little slow.

I'll be back! Dont miss it if you are in town."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Velveeta boxed mac and cheese. Way overpriced for amount of poor quality food and service is  lacking as well. Don't understand what in the world people have enjoyed about eating here."}
{"text":"From St. Louis, stopped at Nana's for soul food and was not disappointed! There was a small 15 minute wait in line, but well worth it. Staff was extremely kind. If I was a local this would definitely be a regular spot for great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! Best Soul Food in Charlotte!  What a great place with great offerings! Fried Chicken, Ribs, Smothered Pork Chops, meatloaf, baked chicken and daily specials. Veggies include Mac & Cheese, collards, black eyed peas, mash, etc. Wow, did I say that already! Our party of 7 had a great experience. The desserts were good, though very portioned, unlike the huge servings of sides."}
{"text":"it was the best meal i've had in a long time! curry chicken is juicy and the yams were amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered the large plate. Comes with two meats and two large sides along with cornbread. I need a nap now. Chicken was seasoned very well. Also had jerk  chicken, jerk chicken rice, cabbage. I would mention the dessert which is Oreo cake, but I'm too full to eat it at this present time.   definitely worth stopping by if you are in the charlotte area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness..I've been missing out!!Let's start with the variety of options available.The selection reminds of you of Sunday dinner at Grandma's house (collards,black eyed peas,bbq ribs,cabbage,rice,fried chicken,lima beans,and much more).I ordered the smothered pork chop,collards,and black eyed peas.My intent was to take a picture for you all to see but the anticipation got the best of me.So that's that!Collards can be cooked a variety of ways,but something was special about these collards.Every bite I was trying to figure out what it was seasoned with.The porkchop and black eyed peas were just as tasty and exceeded my expectations .Usually,I will have leftovers no matter where I go but that was not the case here.They definitely did their thing! 

FYI-I went on a Sunday and we waited in line for approximately 20 minutes before placing our order due to the amount of customers present.However,all food is readily prepared and on the line."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is exactly how a soul food restaurant should be envisioned. When we walked it it felt like home from the smell and the friendly staff greeting us. Various meat options and lots of side items as well. They were very generous with the meat entree and side items. The barbecued pulled chicken was on point and the highly praised yams were great as well. Warning: the yams are very sweet almost like a dessert.

Can't wait to visit again and try more options!"}
{"text":"Nana's Soul food will do in a pinch. Good soul food to a person depends on what part of the South they are from. I had delivery twice in three days. Her fried chicken and pork chops were spot on. The ribs had too much fat on them. The pulled chicken was just ok. The collards the first day were good although they a lot of stems in the greens. The cabbage and greens  on my next delivery were lacking seasoning. The yams on my first delivery was seasoned with cinnamon.....I am used to both cinnamon and nutmeg. The sweet potato pie's crust was not done on the bottom and was under seasoned. The peach cobbler did not resemble any that I have eaten and had a horrible taste. The potato salad was swimming in a loose, liquidly mayonnaise which had some potatoes that where not done. The corn muffins are good. On the whole I will go back but be selective about what I order. Mac and cheese was too gooey."}
{"text":"Just happen to run across Nana's as it was in the vicinity of where I was, and I thought it was delish!  It was a great value for $10 to where I left full, and got a sample of true souther comfort food w/out feeling weighed down or overstuffed. The fried chicken was some of te best I've had - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - and tasty sides. The small cornbread was sweet enough that it scratched a dessert itch without having to buy a dessert. It was simple and tasty. To boot the service was friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Traveling for business and the valet at the hotel said \"if you want some good food, go to Nana's\" so we did and they did not disappoint!! I literally tried half of the menu because everything looked so good. My co-worker and I shared an amazing meal, and will definitely be back the next time we're in Charlotte!! 5 Stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food is wholesome and well worth the price. However, this is not the soul food experience I was hoping for. Nothing is made to order and accommodations are minimal. All in all it was a good budget eatery for the locals but not, I hope, representative of real southern African American cuisine."}
{"text":"I do carry out for almost every meal, every day,  to busy to have time to cook but prefer the taste and feel of home cooking most of the time as opposed to that chain food taste.  They make everything from scratch And is the most consistent place I have found so far.  And it is definitely the best fried chicken spot I have been able to find in Charlotte, and I've tried many!!!  Everyone here is friendly and accommodating.  I can't stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"I went to Nana's for lunch yesterday and It wasn't packed which is good. We dined in and there is a  nice comfortable seating area. This was my 2nd time going. 

Now about the food... The first time that I went,  I did not enjoy the food but I decided to give it a second try. Unfortunately,  the food was still bland and overpriced. I was so disappointed. I ordered the baked chicken, yams and dressing. I didn't dare order the Mac and cheese because I remember from the first time that I went that it was horrible and that I ended up throwing it away. Now if you know me,  I NEVER throw away food,  less known Mac & cheese.  It didn't even look like it had improved any from the last time I visited. One of my coworkers that I was with ordered it and didn't like it either. 

The dressing seemed like it was missing an ingredient and it had a creamy texture to it which was different... The baked chicken was just ok,  I fix better.  The yams were the best thing but even those were just ok. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  Clean and comfortable dining area. Fried chicken was excellent, very moist.  Smothered chop very tasty.  Mac'n cheese, collards, stuffing and pintos all very good.  Would not hesitate to make the drive again next weekend!"}
{"text":"The food is not worth waiting for 25 minutes to place and order. Not only to we wait, but the apology was unprofessional and half-hearted. For the trouble, one free dessert was offered. Really, one free dessert offer after waiting for 25 minutes to place and order? Not sure what type of establishment the owner/manager is really, but this is our first and last time supporting this business. Back to Lawan's on S. Tryon we go, where the food has always been great, and the service is professional and consistent. What were we thinking trying another spot? We're going to stick to what we know, and we know Lawans!"}
{"text":"Five stars. 

Everything was perfect. The inside was clean and provided a casual dining experience. I ordered the bbq rib with Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. The ribs were tender. The Mac was creamy and cheesy. And the mashed potatoes had the perfect texture. To top it off, the sweet tea tasted so southern. Made me wanna go to a Walmart with boots and yodel a Hank Williams song."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. The service is simple, cafeteria style. This is some of the best southern eats in Charlotte and it's good for your soul."}
{"text":"First time here and very happy I came in!! The staff was very helpful and friendly! I ordered fried chicken, collard greens and yams and my goodness!!!! This food is amazing!!! 

Definitely coming back for the ribs and Mac and cheese next time I'm here"}
{"text":"Great staff. Always friendly love the chicken and home made mashed potatoes always get way too much food.  A delight to have in the area.  Real southern hospitality... Go Nana!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I either get the fried chicken with yams and collards or the smothered pork chop with rice and either collards or yams. Depends on how I'm feeling. The food is always hot, always generously portioned and always delicious."}
{"text":"Got a veggie plate & slice if cheese cake. For 3 sides I thought it was a little expensive. Ambiance bland. They pack m in here though. I'd def come again if I was over this way but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Meh! Underwhelmed. Comparing with other soul food samplings I've had. Chicken was dry, mac-n-cheese sat under the heating lamps too long and the BBQ chicken included all parts of the chicken vs. just meat."}
{"text":"This place was good.  I had the curry chicken along with curry rice and collard greens.   The curry chicken was incredible, it was tender and moist.  The collards were pretty good as well, I live in the south and some people make them better than others.

    It got bad after I got home from dinner though.  This place gave me gas from hell, so bad that it made my wife cry. I am not allowed to go back to this place.  Five stars for food, but I took two stars off for the gas factor.  :("}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip. I found Nana's closer to my hotel. This is the best soul food ever! Whenever I come back, I will eat here. You get you money's worth, everything is so delicious. You will not be disappointed with anything you order. I had baked chicken, string beans, and cabbage."}
{"text":"This place had me as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered the curry chicken and baked chicken also. The chicken was full of flavor and served nice and hot. For side items i ordered tuna salad and Mac and cheese. Both side items were served with a smile from the staff. Overall a great little tasty spot right close to the charlotte Douglass airport."}
{"text":"Ok yelpers,  this is the best soul food I've had in years.   the staff is extremely customer oriented and will quickly coach you that you had better try the fried chicken. ...or they will give you a sample! 

the fried chicken is incredible,  barely surpassing the limas and collards.   the collards are big leafy pieces vs the little ones my grandmother made, but just as tasty.  be sure to ask for a little vinegar.   the veggies are so tasty I'll bet they use real lard.

so often a soul food place will let there food over heat or dry out.   not here. ...

follow through with some sweet potatoe pie!"}
{"text":"Visited Nana's for the first time on Sunday with some friends from church.  Restaurant was crowded which is a good sign.  The servers were very friendly and helpful.  The decor was nice.  I had the smothered chicken which was delicious as were the candied yams.  The collard greens were cooked with too much vinegar which was not to my liking.  Otherwise, they were fine.  The cornbread was very dry.  My daughter and I shared a slice of coconut cake which was very heavy and way too sweet.  We're both big fans of coconut cake but not at Nana's.  They ran out of sweet tea which I always order in restaurants.  I really give Nana's 3.5 stars.  It was a little better than A-OK but I can't say that I'm a fan yet.

Not sure that we'll visit too often especially since it's out of our way.  But, it's a nice place to visit every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Finally!  A soul food restaurant near me.  A friend of mine told me about this Nana's.  We went for lunch on a Tuesday.  They had a steady flow of people coming in. The food was so good that I've been back several times since then.  It's in the new Carolina Courts Building right off of Matthews-Indian Trail Rd. It's a hidden gem.  Large dining area and very clean.    For $9.50 you get a meat, two sides, biscuit or cornbread and a beverage.  It's cafeteria style with plenty to choose from.  They have fried, baked, barbecue and smothered chicken, smothered pork chops, tilapia, meatloaf, etc. and then all of the sides that you'd think would be in a soul food restaurant.  They also have a bar area."}
{"text":"Today I went to Nana's for the first time.  I had the Mac and cheese, fried chicken and the cabbage.  I enjoyed the fried chicken it could use a little bit more seasoning.  The Mac and cheese could use another type of cheese.  I do not use Sharp or Cheddar so I am not a fan.   The cabbage was not my taste.  I am probably one of the few who like the green leaves from the cabbage.  Personally I like bell peppers and lemon pepper seasoning in my cabbage so this would be a no for me.  The staff was friendly which is why I gave it a 3."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend. I'm not a soul food connoisseur so I instead use the \"Napkin Index\" as a reliable measure. This one was a 6 napkin affair. Awesome! You order in a traditional buffet line with the glass between you and the steam tables. Had the large plate ($9.99 for two meats, two sides, cornbread and a drink). Selected the fried chicken (2 pieces) and smothered pork chop, rice and beans, and broccoli. The meats were seasoned just right and tasty. Sides were fresh. Washed it down with two glasses of sweet tea... good stuff. The staff couldn't be friendlier. I'm from out-of-town, but I'll be back to Nana's."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was dry, greens were okay, and service was awful. Workers were unfriendly and lazy. I'd rather eat my shoe."}
{"text":"Food was good and hot, however because I was alone doesn't mean I am taking my food out. Would have rather had a plate than a to go container. Overall I would go back"}
{"text":"Wow.  If you want authentic soul food, this is the place to go.  I had the meatloaf on special and what great flavor, melt in your mouth good.  The collards were phenomenal and the curried chicken rice was unique and good.  Portion sizes are generous, and on the pricey side, but comes with a drink.  It's still a great value."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place that a stop was warranted. I'll be short and to the point.

Great staff, very clean place, however the food had absolutely no taste at all. I ordered two fried chicken breast with mash potatoes & greens. 

Again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"First off, I'm fat.  I know food.  This food is outstanding.  We came with a big group, and everyone agreed that each and every dish was over-the-top good.  

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was in town and googled Best Soul Food in Charlotte this and others came up. Just so happen Nana's was next to my hotel! I was not disappointed and I saved gas because it was directly across from my hotel!!"}
{"text":"Visiting NC from AZ and was very disappointed in food - until I tried Nana's!  I had a small plate of smothered fried chicken,great Mac n cheese, yams.  All was flavorful and homecooked. I am on my way to the airport stuffed. Glad I tried one more place. :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, not too heavy yet quite tasty. Good selection of meats, veggies and carbs, primo comfort food. Ambiance is completely unpretentious, with friendly, efficient cafeteria-style service."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A soul food resturant that doesn't make you want to raise your insurance premiums to walk in.  Great part of town, conveniently located between 77 & 85.  Now on to the food.... I have decided to no longer diet!  I can not stay away from the smothered pork chops, BBQ ribs, and ooey goooey mac n cheese.    I actually love the cafeteria style service as well.  The line moves super fast and the set price for small or large makes it affordable.

 They are by far the best Soulf Food place in Charlotte.

Job well done!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in search for a soul food restaurant in Charlotte.

For a small meal - 1 meat and 2 sides, you get it for $9.59

I must say, the baked chicken was dry :(. The collard greens were good, the candies yams were good, just wished it didn't looked so mushy. With the lacking dried chicken, I couldn't finish my cornbread, which was alright - it lacked... The buttery rich taste to a cornbread. 

Overall, not pressed to come back. I give credit for the customer service, the manager and their staff were nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of soul food and cafeteria style restaurants in my life. This is probably one of my top 5. The food was ready to go, no waiting. It was all really good. I had the BBQ ribs, mashed potatoes and gravy, and Mac n cheese. The sides were my favorite for sure. And I don't just mean there, I mean anywhere. I'll go back just for those sides. The ribs were really good too, but I can't stop thinking about the sides. 

The price was a little more than I wanted to pay, but to get it hot and ready as soon as you step in, makes up for that. It also came with the drink, which is normally $2 most places you go to. I will be back and I'm ready to try all of their amazing looking items."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this restaurant while staying the night at an airport hotel to catch a flight early tomorrow morning.  Fantastic food.  Huge surprise.  Hope I get to visit again!"}
{"text":"My sister was craving fried chicken so was debating btw Lawans and Nanas.  We went with Nanas; good choice and not that Lawans is less by no means, but I must say for first time trying Nanas, it won't be my last.  Ordered the fried chicken, and several veggie plates.  The collards were my fav and I honestly would say it's some of the best I've ever had...amazingly good.  The same could be said for the green beans.  The mash potatoes were very good.  The cabbage was good but probably on par with others I've had, but still very good.  The banana pudding was good and definitely not jello based.  The sweet potato pie was awesome.  Highly recommend Nanas!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, quick service, and great food. Had fried catfish with greens and black eyed peas. Very much enjoyed the experience. Will be going back for sure next time I'm in the area for business. It's right by the airport too."}
{"text":"First time at Nana's today, and I was excited to try a new soul food restaurant with my grandmother. It was relatively slow for a Sunday in my opinion, with maybe 5/6 other parties in the restaurant. I ordered a small dinner meal with catfish and two sides. Considering it's fish, I guess their policy is to cook it per order so that it's fresh. Very reasonable, I had no problem with that. HOWEVER, 20+ minutes later with no other patrons in line ordering food, and even one of their employees kept asking where was my food, I decided enough was enough. It definitely doesn't take over 20 minutes to fry two pieces of fish, max 5-10 mins. I went to the register and asked the woman who took my order how long it would be, and her exact response was, \"shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders\", as in I don't know. I instantly asked for a refund. Two employees apologized for my poor experience, which was nice, however no manager approached me to offer me any other options, or a compensated side or diff protein for my very patient wait. PLUS, a customer who came after me and ordered fish had gotten their food and left. My grandmother was finished with her food by the time I even asked for a refund. Funny thing is, I was going to order 3 extra meals for family members who couldn't make it out, but I immediately decided against that after my experience. Long story short, I won't be dining here again, and it's unfortunate because I try my hardest to support Black businesses. Don't order fish if you go here, and don't expect great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place gives some serious portions! I tried their ribs and bourbon chicken. Both were excellent! If you're in the area, dont forget to stop by here!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The Service is fast, the staff is extremely polite.  Had the smothered pork chop, which was delish.  The mac and cheese was just okay and the collards were a bit on the spicy side.  The corn bread a little dry.  This was not my first visit, as I work in the area.  I would give 5 stars if the food was good each time, but there is no consistency.  The service however is always great and the place is clean whenever I visit."}
{"text":"Tried Nana's for the first time and couldn't believe I had been missing out on such delicious food. I had the curry chicken with cabbage and curry chicken rice with a sweet little corn bread muffin. All I could say was \"wow\"..(well I also said the chicken was a bit salty) but I couldn't stop eating it. The flavor of that curry sauce..whew!!...and it had a lil kick to it. The staff was also very friendly. Overall great experience.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love soul food but I get nervous about eating any soul food that wasn't cooked by one of my family members. This is a GREAT should food place. They get pretty crowded. The staff know people come because they enjoy the food, so they don't seem to really care much about giving exceptional service. But overall I had a decent experience and enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Outstanding black-eyed peas, first-rate collard greens, solid mac&cheese. The fried chicken was well-seasoned with flavorful meat, but a little dry. Corn bread was soggy and too sweet."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. Service was great and the people are super friendly.  My food was perfect and my son's food was perfect.  I had the fried chicken and he had baked chicken. Even though the chicken was in a Display case, mine was hot and crispy as though it had just been fried for me.  His was moist and perfectly seasoned.  We both had mashed potatoes and green beans and corn bread and were satisfied with the taste serving size.   The desserts looked delicious, but we didn't get a chance to try those.  Maybe next time we'll leave enough room."}
{"text":"My lunch spot when I'm working in the area. Food is already cooked so you can go down the line  and pick what you want. Chicken is delicious and service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a quick service restaurant, so the rating is for this category and is solely based on the food, not the ambience.  The food was incredible!  I ordered the small plate and the portions were huge.  The mac and cheese was made with real cheese and was so creamy!  The collard greens were excellent, a hint of sweet with a nice spicy zing.  The \"special of the day\" jerk chicken was tender and cooked perfectly, with a flavorful OMG-so-good glaze sauce."}
{"text":"I hate that I didn't take a picture of my food but I swear it didn't stay on the plate long enough! Seriously this has been the most impressive Soul Food restaurant ! The kitchen staff and the line staff were super helpful and friendly - they don't joke around when they say family owned and operated- there is a young girl there, maybe 11 working the front line and ROCKS it out! She is more accurate with her orders than most adult staff I know! Anyway back to the food...I had the fried chicken (awesome) black eyed peas (almost as good as mine) macaroni and cheese (waaay better than mine) and corn bread (amazing) husband had the fried Tilapia (very good) green beans (best in town) and something else that I don't remember...I don't remember because I was face deep into my fathers catfish! I promise you it was the best catfish I have ever had! Do your self a favor and make it a point to come in and have some food, but more importantly, have a conversation! Almost all of the staff and the owner came out to check on us and have a chat! Omg! Don't forget the banana pudding! I can't even tell you how good it was except to say I got one to go and it was so good I only let myself eat a little bit at a time so I could enjoy it for a few days!!!!! Looking forward to my next trip back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quick and fast and delicious.  Had the fried chicken, lima beans, and collard greens; all good.  Wish they had a few more options for proteins, but that's not really a complaint.  Small plate was great for a hearty lunch."}
{"text":"Nana's was sooo good.  Desire hooked me up with Yams (in which i don't normally like)  these yams were amazing.  I had the Meatloaf special it was pretty good, the Mac and Cheese was really good and the Catfish was amazing.  I am so looking forward to the next time I am back in town.  I love supporting local small business and definitely think this place is worth supporting.  Way better then going to a chain restaurant.  Thank you Desire"}
{"text":"Pretty nice restaurant that's is marked as soul food. The staff are friendly and the place was clean for a week day afternoon. They have two seating areas indoor and outdoor. The food was good. I had the lunch special where you get a meat and two sides with your choice of bread (corn bread or a roll) and a fountain drink. The chicken was moist and tasty, the Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes were okay. The corn bread was sweet. A peer of mine had the barbecue chicken and it was covered in a glaze you couldn't see where the bones were. They have a cooler packed with desserts from Oreo cake, yellow, strawberry filled, etc. i didn't get a chance to try these tasty treats but they looked good. it's a cafeteria style place which is easy to accommodate. There is plenty of parking in a shared lot on the strip. If your in the area I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"The selection is crazy ! I has the Monday special and the BBQ chicken did not disappoint. The greens has a nice kick to it and the mac and cheese was cooked perfect ."}
{"text":"So my father in law is a snow bird and asks me if I knew where a good soul food restaurant is. Well this place was recommended by a fellow I work with so I thought I'd give this place a try. Man oh man is the food here great. If you're a first timer they explain it all to you and you get your food quick. Good prices too."}
{"text":"OMG, soul food done right that even your dead southern great granny from Muscle Shoals, Alabama would be proud to eat! I thought I'd found the best soul food in Charlotte some time ago, but I was wrong! Nana's takes soul food to another level! Now I'll be honest, when I walked in to this new strip building store front, saw a pretty large dining room that was nicely done, I thought it was going to be pretty tasteless in southern comfort food circles! The Fried Chicken alone would have brought me back time and again! Crispy batter with excellent flavors, and a juicy interior that had me speechless! The Mac n Cheese was some of the richest and creamiest I've had without being runny! The green beans were superb with bits of onions and a definite taste of bacon, fatback, or some kind of secret southern goodness! The Smothered Pork Chop, which normally I could care less about, was soaked in a brown gravy after being fried to a golden brown! Left simmering in a brown gravy for hours and yet still tender! You won't find this type of southern soul food just anywhere. Normally you'd have to look for this out in the country on a Sunday afternoon! Deep below the Mason Dixon Line where cholesterol was believed to be some fancy motor oil developed by a wayward Yankee!"}
{"text":"Wasn't to impressed with today's visit. I had a smothered pork chop with string beans, a roll, rice and gravy. The pork chop was tasty and tender. The string beans were good but a little to salty. The rice was bland and I didn't get enough gravy on it. The roll was dry and had no taste. They definitely need to consider a better roll or make some fresh...."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken only on Thursdays.  Bbq chicken or pulled pork only on Mondays.  Bourbon chicken only on Tuesdays. So, only fried or baked chkn today or meatloaf.  Never mind."}
{"text":"Best soul food I've had outside of South Carolina! Huge portions of home cooked faves: awesome Mac n Cheese, superb crispy and well seasoned chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, tangy collards. I'm stuffed and happy beyond belief!"}
{"text":"Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww ewwwwwwwww ewwwwwwww this food is beyond garbage..... if this classifieds as soul food then ewwwwwwwww. Like how can you mess up mac & cheese ewwwwwww."}
{"text":"I heard some amazing things about this little place so we decided to stop in as soon as I got off my plane! The customer service was really good! The place was clean. The atmosphere was cool kind of like cafeteria like. The food is served somewhat cafeteria style as well you tell the servers what you want behind the glass and they serve it to you. 

Ok so a lot of the food is precooked which I usually don't love but it was still hot so that's the plus. I had the fried fish which was good very well seasoned and they fried it when I ordered it. The yams and fish were the highlight of my order. The Mac and cheese was too dry for me. 

My friend had some curry chicken I think and fried chicken he didnt love his food.  He enjoyed the yams and didn't like the Mac either. We ordered dessert to go sweet potato pie for him and cheesecake sweet potato pie for me. His slice was huge, my slice was the tiniest piece of cheesecake I had ever seen. 

I might go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"The customer service they provide is excellent! I was greeted when I came in and every employee was super friendly and welcoming! I got the large plate which comes with 2 sides and 2 meats, I ordered the fried chicken and BBQ ribs with Mac and cheese and macaroni salad. I have high expectations when it comes to soul food. So I probably wouldn't have considered this place if I knew all the food was already prepared and displayed in a glass case and just kept warm or warmed up when ordered. I didn't really care for the ribs. They were a bit fatty and overcooked, which tends to make the meat dry. The macaroni salad had way too much relish or something, and I wasn't able to get past that taste. The mac and cheese was just 'ok'. Not a traditional baked Mac and cheese more of a KFC side of Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was pretty good. The flavors were spot on but it lacked the crunchy skin since it wasn't fresh. Because the service was so great, I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"Third time here and food is very consistently good.  My only issue thus far is the GREENS they are full of stems; chewy and overly sweet!  I like the candied yams; the Lima beans; the potato salad; the curry rice and per my son the dressing is good and the Mac n cheese  

Of the meats I can say the fried chicken; curry chicken; baked chicken; and the ribs are on point! My daughter had the fried catfish and noted a weirdly different ingredient in the corn meal batter it was not her fave! The pulled BBQ chicken is very spicy also.  

Drinks are par for the course! 

Affordable and good eats for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for a good home cooked meal, quick and tok the point! For $11 you get a full meal and drink to wash it down. The jerk chicken, which is the Friday special is served with great seasoning and just the right amount of heat! They have a variety of entrees to select from if that's not your thing from healthy baked chicken to smothered fried pork chops. You get to select two sides which again is difficult to choose from with the variety they have to sect from, my favorites are Mac n cheese, and yams, but the have tender greens with a slight bite, cabbage, black eyed peas and more. 
If that is not enough you can end with a delightful homemade dessert for s few more bucks, my fave is the peach cobbler!
Located near the CLT airport and some nice airport hotels, this is a go to spot to have a taste of home away from home!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had someone serving my food use a second spoon to scrap off excess, to make sure I didn't get more than exactly a spoonful of rice!! My sides didn't even touch the sides of the container they were so stingy! Then they wasn't to charge me almost $13!! On top of everything it wasn't even that good!! Never again! And I tell people not to go unless they want to be disappointed. Soul food is lacking in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Delicious soul food for the soul! Owners were very kind and the staff is very welcoming  The Catfish dinner was a great choice and there homemade deserts topped it off!"}
{"text":"Not being from the south but a huge fan of soul food and southern culture gotta tell you about Nana's Soul Food Kitchen. Many combinations to choose from but always go for the fried chicken and if you do that may as well get some greens and mac n cheese. Actually you're on a roll now grab two orders and I'll be right over!"}
{"text":"Good Food , I had Fried Chicken breast , Smothered pork chop with Mac and cheese and mash potatoes and gravy. CHICKEN was crisp and delicious Pork chop was okay wasn't big fan of gravy Mac and cheese was good mash potatoes was mash potatoes . Service was great from ordering to check out. .I will visit again"}
{"text":"My friends and I actually saw the commercial for Nana's Kitchen while on vacation in Charlotte. I decided to visit today, before leaving Charlotte. This restaurant had a nice crowd. I thought we would've waited longer than what we did. I was impressed.  I am a very picky eater and I do not eat pork. I was very satisfied to find out that Nana's Kitchen did not have pork in their vegetables, so that was a plus for me. The customer service was pleasing as well. The food was delicious. I ordered Baked Chicken, Cabbage, and Collard Greens only. If I'm in town again, I would definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I wish the food had more seasoning but It is still good. I would recommend them and the staff is always polite and smiling. Just be sure to bring enough money. I brought my coworker there to get a plate and a slice a cake and it was like $20 lol. He wasn't thrilled. Their location caters to the corporate offices nearby but could still be a little more reasonable. Lawans which is 10 minutes away is substantially less. Overall go here and grab you a nice meal just bring a few extra bucks with you."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes and corn bread. Absolutely delicious! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fast food type setup with great tasting chicken. Not a dining experience but definitely two steps up from the local hotel food.

If you are at a hotel within walking distance, a great little find. 

Spicy curry chicken and spicy curry rice. I really enjoyed the greens since they were not too vinegary.  

Give it a try. Ambience underwhelming. No real decor to speak of. Staff are pleasant and efficient. 

I would come back in a heartbeat. 

Oh yea, great value.  Less than $18."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on the reviews with my friend who wanted to go to Merts. He couldn't stop raving that: \"The food is so good it makes you want to slap your Momma\". It is the best fried chicken we have had and he loved the mac-n-cheese. It isn't just cheesy but it is also creamy the way a great mac-n-cheese is supposed to be. All the sides are great. He also got ribs which he thought were good too. Great place, great food and great prices!"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious. They always greet you when you come in & the food is definitely prepared with love. I make a stop every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What a great find! Missed a connecting flight in Charlotte, staying at the Hyatt wandered across the street to find this wonderful soul food restaurant. super nice people inside, very clean the great selection of amazing tasting food at reasonable prices for really large portions. And it gets better they let you taste any of the dishes before you order them!! I was almost so full that I could not order Lunch. But I did fried catfish collard greens and curried rice potato salad and a peach cobbler for dessert. yum!!
Girlfriend got the curry chicken white meat loved it also"}
{"text":"While the reviews were mixed I decided to give this place a chance. I think that my palate for GREAT soul food has been influenced by awesome cooks Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana. Being new to Charlotte, coming from Chicago, I had some higher expectations. I had the jerk wings, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes and banana pudding. My guy had the baked chicken, stuffing (not dressing), black eyed peas and potato salad.

The majority of the food tasted canned, frozen or not from scratch. The jerk wings were more barbecued covering than jerk spice, but so-so. The black eyed peas were ok and the sweet potatoes were decent. The stuffing was just that. The potato salad was downright awful. The banana pudding tasted a bit like a gooey boxed pudding mix.

I would not return again."}
{"text":"Once again you must realize in reviewing a restaurant that you are comparing it to the standard mark the concept is trying to hit. Initially, we were going to the nearby Jersey Mike's until we saw the sign for Nana's.  Great choice!  So, Nana's gets five stars for being a Soul Food Kitchen.  Initially, if you are going to call yourself a soul food kitchen, that means you and your staff must be cheerful, friendly and joy filled...and they were.  We were pleasantly greeted, asked if this was our first time visiting and given an explanation of their food offering and how it worked.  It is basically a cafeteria style serving with the food set out in a buffet that is tended to by the servers.  I could not pass up the fried chicken from a Soul Food Kitchen, but there were other meat choices such as pulled BBQ chicken, salisbury steak, ribs, etc.  The fried chicken did not disappoint - all dark meat for me, of course, but it was flavorful, crunchy, not overly breaded and also not greasy.  This is some of the best fried chicken I have had.  Sides were typical, mac and cheese, black eyed peas, lima beans (butter beans), etc.  But since it is a Soul Food Kitchen and since I love collard greens, I had to ask if they cook their collards with brown sugar (yuk) or not.  Instead of trying to describe the flavor, I was offered a sample tasting and these were without brown sugar and with a slight hint of spiciness.  They were tender but not cooked to mush, still having some leafy green integrity.  Next to the green beans - canned or homemade?, I asked.  \"Homemade.\"  I'll have that.  They tasted like my mother's green beans, which is very good, tender, savory, salty but not too much and not cooked with a bunch of grease.  They tasted fresh, not like the tinny canned taste I had feared.  The cornbread was accurately NOT SWEET and tasted just as cornbread should taste, not like a peice of cake.  This is the kind of food I grew up on and often cook myself.  They hit every single item out of the park.  So, Nana's isn't going to compare to Morton's or the Capital Grille, but it doesn't have to because that is not what they are...what they are is an outstanding family run Soul Food Kitchen that gets five stars for excellence at doing just that!!"}
{"text":"This was the BEST soul food I had in my life. No lies. You have got to try this place. You will be hooked. I know anytime I am here, I will be stopping by to get me my plate of food!!! You don't know what you missing until you go there."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the special - bbq chicken. It was tasty, but there was a fair amount of cartilage I had to pick out."}
{"text":"My goodness, what a meal. I got the double meat plate and was served about four helpings of delicious food! The staff was great and walked me through each of the dishes and sides. I settled on dark-meat chicken, a smothered pork chop and sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. (All on recommendations.) The chicken was a little dry, but the coating more than made up for it. The pork chop shined. It was so good, it was almost decedent. The mashed potatoes were real (with little lumps), and the mac and cheese was as good as billed. It's my new go-to eat when I'm in Charlotte for business."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken with mash potatoes and mac and cheese. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly and the mac and cheese was in the top 5 that I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Got take out last night ordered the catfish which was over cooked and salty. The Mac & cheese tasted like stove top and like if it was sitting on the line for hours. The candy yams was my favorite . The cornbread was dry. I was so disappointed in the food because I was craving soul food that night. Please tell the cooks to not served burnt mac & cheese and to lighten up on the seasoning for the fish."}
{"text":"Send a business district weird location but worth the trip out of the way to go there fried chicken and the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese was unbelievable I'm actually thinking about going back as we speak I highly recommend this place is very good expensive but it's good it's a couple bucks more and you get home could cooking food I recommend this place great"}
{"text":"Was just newly moved to Clt and looking for a good BBQ fix.  Really solid moist ribs.  Its cafeteria style and nothing fancy but just good Q.  the fried Chicken smelled delic so Im going to try that next.  The sides were just kinda ok and the dessert options were not alluring at all.  Will go back for ribs and chicken but they could really have something good here if they stepped it up with the sides.  Not that they will, they already have a busy busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. I always do the Two meats plate. This is a regular place for me. Great soul food reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the service of the restaurant as I didn't get to visit the physical location. My father brought home some leftovers (that was catered possibly, not entirely sure) from his work where they were served a meal from Nana's. But boy was I glad that I got the opportunity to try some of the food! 

I had the fried chicken breast and cornbread. Even reheated, the fried chicken was still moist, tender, and crispy. It was cooked well and still juicy. Not overcooked and dry like you find at a lot of other restaurants. 

The cornbread was SO good! It was incredibly moist with just a hint of sweetness. Again, a big difference that the cornbread or corn muffins you find at other places that are dry and crumbly. I definitely look forward to being able to visit Nana's in person, to enjoy another excellent meal there."}
{"text":"Very good food..... I have been twice when staying in the area for work and the place is great.  Not sure about the lower reviews but the mac and cheese was very good.



A large plate, drink and dessert will run 20 bucks.  While not \"cheap\", still comparable to other places."}
{"text":"Being in residence across the street on a Sunday, this was an obvious choice since it's pretty much the only walkable restaurant open. What I didn't realize was that it was just as well that I didn't leave visiting Nana's to chance because I sure would have missed out on a treat had I not eaten there. 

Typical Southern/Soul Food served within. Hearty servings and a friendly staff make this place a must visit. Not everything on the menu that I tried was a win however. Here's a road guide through my dinner.

+ Smothered Pork Chops were delish. Very tender and slathered with some lightly salted gravy. Perfect ratio of meat to fat, with a little bone in there too. Exactly the way you would want it. You must order this.

+ Candied yams smell like Christmas. More to the point, these are not canned, but rather homemade with a good helping of brown sugar that has them swimming in deliciousness. Not too sweet, and you still get that natural yam taste. Must order.

+ I'm a recent mac and cheese convert, and this is very good standard homestyle mac and cheese. 

+ Standard banana pudding made from instant pudding with fresh bananas and Vanilla Wafers. This is a never fail formula and I like it. I learned tonight that homemade baked banana pudding is even better.....I'm intrigued.

-- RIbs were a bit of a miss during my visit. Not very warm and the meat wasn't very soft. Sauce was fine, but perhaps my expectations were too high? The way I like my ribs are falling off the bone. If you have to use a knife, they aren't tender enough. If you like your ribs the way I do, you may not enjoy these. 

-- Rice was dry and firm. While pasta can be served al dente, rice should not be. Turned out that the chef had overcooked the rice, so that explains it. Sean, the owner, expressed concern and got to the bottom of that.

-- Corn Bread was not moist in the center, but rather a little dry. I also like mine a little toasted, but perhaps I'm a corn bread snob?

Overall, the cleanliness of the restaurant, TVs in the dining area, friendly staff, and Sunday hours, contribute a lot to the appeal. The owner, Sean, made the rounds and spoke to each customer in the dining area to check on their meals, and he means it. I mentioned the rice being firm and my friend didn't like the ribs.....done. We got an extra serving of the Smothered Pork Chops and Candied Yams. This is how business is done right. You listen to the customers and make sure nobody leaves your restaurant unsatisfied. Well done Sean, we enjoyed our food and appreciated your coming by to check on us. 

Also, congrats on your upcoming first year anniversary of being open and being voted at #1 Soul Food in Charlotte! Don't let it go to your head, you've got hungry mouths to feed that now have expectations ;-)"}
{"text":"We had no idea Nana's Soul Food Kitchen existed until we arrived at Salsarita's and the line was out the door.  Having only an hour for lunch, we decided to give the neighboring Nana's a try...  OMG!  it was fantastic!!  WAY better than Salsarita's ever thought about being!

We walked in not knowing what to expect, but it was clean, well organized and piping hot  :-)  There were plenty of choices for everyone's tastes.  The meats were fresh and well seasoned, the veggies were like your grandma had just put them on the table and the sweet cornbread didn't even need butter.  The sweet tea tasted just like my sweet tea at home in my refrigerator and it was self serve, so we never ran out  :-)

We were in & out and back to work within an hour...  I've never been so thankful for a lunch rush as I was today...  thanks for being there when we needed you Nana's!"}
{"text":"This food was amazing! Place gets packed on Sunday's during brunch time but soooo worth the wait. The yams are my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food. Cafeteria style but better. All good was hot, fresh, and very good. 40 guests with plenty of room for more. Patio and seating inside as well. Staff was. Wry friendly and professional. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Really GREAT fried chicken & sides! The seasoning was perfect. I had mashed potatoes & gravy plus cabbage with my chicken. We're from Cary area and I think they are better than Mama Dips"}
{"text":"We went to NaNa's kitchen and the food was pretty good. I got the jerk chicken dinner and it was pretty good however I wasn't a fan of the jerk BBQ sauce. I prefer to have my chicken marinated in jerk seasonings and grilled the authentic way. My boyfriend got the fried chicken dinner and he enjoyed his meal. Their cornbread is addictive. We will certainly go here again."}
{"text":"Here's the amazing thing about soul food; it is as diverse as the people that prepare it. With that said; I will say that NaNa's is ok. I can  unequivocally say I have had better; and not just from my Mommy's kitchen. I got the small plate which came with two meats and two sides. I chose the baked chicken and my two sides were white rice and cabbage. I also paid extra for the macaroni (who gets soul food with no Mac and cheese?) The cabbage was seasoned and cut very well; no huge chunks of hard cabbage, very tender. The chicken could use a little less seasoning salt, but it was palatable; I put some Texas Pete on it and it was perfection! The rice was also well made, but it's hard to mess up white rice (in my opinion). I also got the macaroni and it was HORRIBLE! I couldn't eat more than two bites. I can't really describe it; it was just a cheesy thick mess. I'm looking at it now with a scowl on my face. I also got a piece of cornbread that was included in my meal. I'm used cornbread having a golden outside; very light; this one was very dense and pale in color. 

I was very underwhelmed with the food, but the reason I gave my review 3 stars is because the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I visited from New York for a wedding and my friends and I were looking for a good place to eat on our last day. This place proved to be incredible and the best tasting food we had in North Carolina. This place was affordable and had great portion sizes. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have an incredible dining experience."}
{"text":"In a not-so wonderful turn of events at the airport dealing with the horrible experience of Delta airlines, I found myself in an interesting Anthony Bourdain-like Layover experience drawing me to the nearest place to my hotel: Nana's Soul Food Kitchen.

Giving up on using the meal vouchers Delta so \"graciously\" threw at me, I took a walk just across the parking lot. Little did I know what I'd be in for when I stepped into Nana's: a smorgasbord of down-home fried and mashed favorites in sizable helpings. Fried fish and chicken and country style steak galore. Don't even dare ask for no gravy on those mashed potatoes, you're not a child anymore! Man up to those collards, they'll put hair on your chest, back and elsewhere.

The way I see it, I've not seen many places better for true southern comfort food cookin' than this. The atmosphere in this place is so friendly and the staff so amicable you feel as if they'll burst into some throw-down gospel soul to go with the soul food. Everybody is like family in this place."}
{"text":"My first time to Nana's and man, it was so AWESOME I slapped my momma... The food was just right in all areas: flavors, spice and heat... Portions were unbelievable, the large is two meals... The service was GREAT... Price was just right... Do your self a favor and go to Nana's, if you ain't got soul you will when you leave?"}
{"text":"Best collard greens I have ever tried! The fish is made to order. Everything was on point. The food is a bit pricey but man is it tasty!!! I can eat a bowl of their greens with nothing else. The yams a bit watery than I'm used to but everything was so fresh and well seasoned. Can't take my mind off those greens."}
{"text":"I happen to love soul food, and had heard about Nana's for some time - but rarely get to this part of town, and when I do, it's typically for the market, at which point I almost always forget about Nana's (even though they are open on Saturdays, if you're there late enough).

As luck would have it, I finally made it there one day during a normal rush hour while running errands and found a monstrous crowd. Apparently the word is out, because Nana's is one popular place. In fact, the whole center that they are in is rather popular, because there is no way all of those cars were for people visiting Nana's. It was nuts.

Once inside, it was an awesome experience to go down that line and view all the items on the bar - just makes me wish that they had a buffet. Of course if it was, I probably still wouldn't have left, so it's probably a good thing.

There are plenty of items on the line at Nana's, and every one of them that I've tried has been quite tasty - but I'm sure most are not particularly good for you. The sides are especially tempting, from mac and cheese like Granny used to make, to melt-in-your-mouth yams (none of that marshmallowy sweet potato casserole here!). This is the good stuff, and even the tea is on point.

As you approach the end of the line, the have plasticware for eating and even hot sauce in packets, and since I typically make use of it, I grabbed some, but the food was so good, I didn't even open it. Nice."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Staff was very friendly and patient. I had family from Canada who wanted some \"soul food\" and we googled this place. They answered all of our questions. I got the fried chicken and fried catfish with macaroni and potato salad. The portions are insanely huge. Catfish was so light and fluffy as well as crispy. Fried chicken was so juicy. It was so good. Sweet tea is also amazing! The customer service and food is another reason to go back! You will not leave this place full."}
{"text":"Curry chicken, collards, sweet potatoes, and sweet tea! Mmm. Even better with sweet potato pie for desert. The portion I received was generous, the staff was friendly to this out-of-towner, and the food was delicious. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wowww!!!!  I had a long day on the road and wanted something delicious for dinner. Went to Yelp and found Nana's. I can't wait to come back. The portions were massive and the food hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a southern girl an this was the second time I've had Nanas soul food kitchen an it was not soul food.  The Mac n cheese tasted as if it came out the box it had a powder  taste. I make baked mac n cheese n you use eggs to hold it together an sharp cheddar cheese w milk. This was like a powder cheese crossed with nacho cheese. Now the fried chicken was good. The peach cobbler tasted like canned peaches being fresh peaches are in season I would use fresh. The banana pudding was just like pudding w wafers an a few bananas very thick an bland. I see all the reviews an ppl really like this place but it wasn't soul food to me."}
{"text":"Solid. The small plate is not as big as people are making it seem. White meat is 1 breast and two sides. I got a scoop of mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The coleslaw was cut kind of large, mayo tasting. They offer cornbread or a roll with your meal. All together with a drink about $10."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I ordered the curry chicken with mac and cheese and green beans. At first I thought, maybe I shouldn't order curry chicken at a \"soul food\" place since that's not typically what I think of when I think of soul food but it's on my soul food list now. EVERYTHING was good. Will definitely come again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes! Very happy to try Nana's kitchen: affordable and delicious meals, exactly what I expected. 

Fried chicken was very crispy and has a little spice to the breading which I appreciate. The ribs fell off the bone and smothered pork chops were tasty too. Sides were as good- creamy mac n cheese and mashed potatoes, yams had right amount of sweetness to it. Collard greens tasted a bit bitter and corn bread was pretty dry. But overall, very happy camper!

Their quick to serve you down the line and the place was clean. Staff was also friendly!"}
{"text":"My favorite food/restaurant in Charlotte and I've been to a lot of the establishments in town. Some say Price's Chicken Coop has the best fried chicken. NO! Nana's does. Period."}
{"text":"Their customer service is nonexistent. I'm not convinced that their food is homemade. I had the tilapia which is fried to order. That took about 10 minutes. My sides were collard greens and yams. Pretty sure both were from the can. I ordered dessert, banana pudding. I mean I guess.... I would have given the them at least three stars if the customer service had been better."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly.  The place is spotless.  The food is amazing and at a great price.  Be warned, the food is very filling and the portions are huge!  This is my new favorite place to eat in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"Food qas very good, cafeteria style, staff was very friendly. Very close to CLT and hotel I was staying at."}
{"text":"Kind of a GEM! I went there on Christmas and one of the workers there explained the menu to me as soon as I walked in because he could tell it was my first time there. I got the 1 meant and 2 sides plate which was around $10. It was delicious and super affordable, plus they were quick. 

Definitely try this place out if you can. The customer service was great and they were fast with my food."}
{"text":"A year ago I ate here and thought the food was excellent.  Unfortunately, my latest visit has me second-guessing my first impression. The macaroni and cheese was thick and pasty, not cheesy; the corn bread didn't seem quite done.  And, whom ever cut up the collard greens and onions used to season them, was just too lazy to cut them up into bite-size pieces.  I also noticed the price has increased quite a bit since my initial visit, and it is definitely not worth the increase, so I don't plan to eat there anymore."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food was great. This time, not so much. The fried chicken, cabbage, and black eyed peas were so salty. Everything was sodium packed except for the lemonade. A quarter of the way through the meal, I was so bloated and sluggish. The food gave me diarrhea. I didn't finish half of it. A waste of $12. I will not be going back unless I need a laxative."}
{"text":"OMG! I just died and went to heaven! Made my nephew stop by on our way to the airport. And now I can't wait to come back and try some more on my next visit. Had the fried (juicy) chicken, mac n cheese (bomb!) and the yams (good lawd!). And I tried his delicious bourbon chicken (yum!)! Everything is amazing. So if you are in the area please give this place a try, you will love it. The food is great and the service is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Wear your big pants with the elastic waist when you come here. This place is amazing! The staff is so much fun and nice. The food is so good and they give you so much of it. I'm talking multiple plates with piles of food. The fried chicken was awesome but the smothered chicken was to die for. The greens were well seasoned and the mac n cheese was creamy. What really sets Nana's apart from the other soul food places in the area is that the large plates come with (wait for it) TWO MEATS whereas at most places an upgrade usually gets you another side. Also, the meals include a drink. You definitely get your money's worth here folks."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel close by and found this place on Yelp. It didn't disappoint! Curry chicken was very flavorful and soft. Curry rice had a perfect kick and the pinto beans with a hint of sweetness. Cornbread was very good as well."}
{"text":"I travel for work and miss a lot of family dinners. This right here is definitely a taste of home. Seasoned heaping portions of food. There's so much to choose from!! I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Decided I would come here for lunch with my parents since we were nearby and the reviews were pretty good. I was glad we came by.

We all enjoyed our meals. My mother and I both enjoyed the fried chicken plate. My sides were the curried rice with black eyed peas both were great. She had the collard greens with mac and cheese which she also enjoyed. My father  ordered the grilled chicken he enjoyed his as well.

I was the only one who saved room for dessert (lucky me) a slice of strawberry cake it was pretty good. They have many desserts to choose from.

It is a pretty relaxed restaurant no rush to leave after you eat at least on a Friday during lunch. I would go back again if I ever happened to be on this side of town and hungry."}
{"text":"Great food!  Super nice staff. Really nice selection of food. The fried chicken is delicious and juicy. I had the curry rice side which was insanely good.  I met the owner Shawn and he is very friendly and gracious. This was a nice find and we look forward to eating here again and again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff members were super helpful when they found out it was our first time here. They explained everything and were very sweet. The food is delicious (collard greens....yummmm!) and plentiful. The two of us dined for less than $25 and it was all wonderful."}
{"text":"close to the airport, and the food is fantastic.  @ruggynyc you have to eat here!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get soul food in Charlotte. The food is served cafeteria style, so your able to see all of the offerings. I usually go for the fried chicken or fried fish with cabbage, collard greens or yams. All of the meals come with generous portions and a beverage. If you're undecided they will let you try out the sides before you purchase them. I would suggest this as I am not fond of the taste of all of the sides that they carry. Take a look at the menu before time and have an idea of what you want. The line can get long quickly and though the servers want to help you make a good decision, they also want to move you along as quickly as possible. They also have a good variety of desserts, consisting of sliced cakes & pies (all of which are delicious)."}
{"text":"Got the large plate with baked chicken and chicken wings.  The wings were amazing and falling off the bone.  Only $15 for the large plate of two meats and two sides. I had desert which they warmed up for me.  Staff was very friendly.  I recommend this place for good food and fast service."}
{"text":"This was easily the best \"home cooked\" food I've eaten anywhere in a long time. My entire family was pleased with everything they were served. Every bite, from the meat to the side dishes to the dessert, was awesome. As out of towners you are always hoping wherever you choose to eat will pan out and this place delivered in spades!  We plan on making a trip back down there just to eat at Nana's. They also own the pizzeria in the same plaza and I plan on trying that as well. 

The staff was excellent and the restaurant itself was tastefully decorated and had a comfortable feel. I can't wait to go back.  ^_^"}
{"text":"This food was awful. We went on Father's Day the corn muffin was ice cold..the smothered pork chop had no flavor...the mac n cheese was bland. The green beans were from the can and you could tell. I sent my corn muffin back twice..I finally just gave up and threw it away. The only thing that looked good was the fried chicken.."}
{"text":"Our team catered in Nana's an it was amazing. Mac-n-cheese, collard greens, ham, stuffing, brown gravy . . . Delish!!! Tasted just like your own Nana made it and maybe better. ;)"}
{"text":"It was the worst soul food I've ever had in my LIFE !! Not sure if I went to the same restaurant..that you all are giving rave review to..but I will never ever patronize this place again..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at Nana's for lunch this afternoon. At 12:30pm, during a busy lunch crowd, we still made it thru the line in 5 minutes. The food is set up cafeteria-style, and everything smells and looks so yummy. We both had the small plate, which consists of 1 meat, 2 sides, cornbread/roll, and a drink. I have been wanting to try their meatloaf, and when I tell you... it tastes like mom's meatloaf. I also had their mac-n-cheese which was so creamy, and their cucumber salad which was crisp and fresh. My friend had their fried chicken (which was piping hot and the skin was so crispy), along with yams and mac-n-cheese. The ladies behind the counter were friendly and cheery and engaging, and the dining area itself was clean and neat (with the exception of some water near the drink machines). My only complaint is that I ate too much, and couldn't take a nap afterwards! I will definitely be a lunch-time repeat customer!"}
{"text":"If you are in Charlotte and want a wonderful taste of the South, stop here. Clean and nice, close to airport, with the best quality southern food."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and the 4-star rating, I was excited and expectant. But unfortunately, Nana's was a soul food swing and miss for me. Honestly, I wish I'd known this before hauling my party of 5 in for dinner. (Especially when it was a toss-up between Nana's & Mert's.) 

First, the good news. Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean, the chicken (baked and fried) was PHENOMENAL, and the staff was kind and helpful. 

Other than that, I'm scratching my head as the rest was a burst of mediocrity. Although the 5 small plates we ordered all tasted fair, the goldish-green colored cabbage was a conundrum. The refrigerated dessert case was a huge disappointment also. We bought slices of strawberry and chocolate cake, and neither piece was the least bit moist and tasted store bought. I also wish you could see the food offerings displayed through the lids on the serving line. (I like to see what I'm buying, just saying!)

Nana's is not my favorite, but I didn't leaving hating my life. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese, Good Lawd, it's amazing. I love the variety. I love the fact that there are not huge changes in the menu every day. I love that the staff is extremely friendly. I also love the selection of dessert. Sometimes, I don't feel like cooking but need that southern comfort of smothered... \"anything\" and this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been watching and waiting for Nana's Soul Food Kitchen to open.  Heaven knows we need more options on the Southwest side of Charlotte.  I stopped in 3/2/11 after a long day at work.  The food is setup on steam tables, some of which looked like it had been there for since lunch time.  There is an option for a small or large plate where you pick your meat and 2 sides and includes a drink.  I choose the whiting, yams and collards.  There is a cooler full of desserts, bananna pudding was out so I got te peach cobbler.  I drove home inhaling the aroma ready to sample my meal.  The fish was alright but could have been seasoned a bit more for my taste, but given that everyone has different tastes, a hittle hot sauce did the trick.  The yams were delicious even though they were a bit sweeter than I am would prepare,  the collards were on the money.  My one mistake was not putting the peach cobbler in the microwave for a minute, since I really don't care for it cold.  However, it was flavorable with the right amount of crust,  I prefer a little sugar on my crust or that it be baked a little harder.  The only thing missing though was a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Fora newly opened resturant there will naturally be some growing pains.   Nana's is on my yes list.  It will be great to watch them grown."}
{"text":"My first time trying this restaurant and it is a long drive from my house.  It is very dirty inside and most the table were not wiped down.  They do not offer meatloaf everyday, which is what I wanted-but it was not documented on the online menu or anywhere on their website.  SO I ended up with the vegetable plate.  The cabbage was absolutely awful.  Horrible sweet-ish soury taste. The mashed potatoes with gravy and the cornbread was good.  1 out of 2 staff members was friendly and helpful.  It was mostly a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ate here since it was so painlessly close to airport hotel. The fried chicken was dry, the portions were enormous and pretty expensive, and everything was pretty meh. Felt very processed and not really as home-cooked and fresh as it could have been. Yams seemed to come out of a can. I respect what they're trying to do, but it just wasn't up to snuff, especially not for 11$ per plate. Left us feeling heavy and weighed down and totally regretting our decision."}
{"text":"I arrived at 1:00 PM on a Wednesday afternoon.  Good size crowd, which is a good sign when choosing a restaurant for the first time.

The folks behind the counter were very friendly.  

I ordered the smothered pork chops, cabbage, and yellow rice.  All three had decent flavor, BUT everything was slightly overcooked and the cornbread was dry.

I love soul food, and the size of the crowd tells me that people like this place.  I might give the place another try in the future, but I wasn't super impressed with my first visit."}
{"text":"I had the \"Small Plate\" of Bourbon Chicken, Mac & Cheese, potato salad & cornbread for $10.  All delicious!  I could only finish half so got a to-go box, planning on bring the rest to lunch the next day but it was so good I ate the rest when I got home.  So glad I stumbled in!!"}
{"text":"Friendly people, amazing food, spectacular place.  Don't be afraid that it's in a strip mall...it's authentic Southern cooking and hospitality.  Absolutely outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Prices are high but you get a decent amount of food. Love the chicken , Mac n cheese and red velvet cheesecake! Omg I will gain weight eating the cheesecake it's so addicting. My friend came to visit from Atlanta and she keeps raving about craving from this place lol."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Charlotte this is a must stop. Always great food and service. I will be back and you should make it a must stop as well."}
{"text":"Nana's is by far my favorite soul food spot. Perfectly cooked meats, phenomenal sides... well worth the price! To top it all off the customer service is great, very friendly and welcoming staff... true southern hospitality. Exceeded my expectations in every way."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best soul food restaurants I've been to.   I'm visiting from out of state and I could eat here everyday (if I could).  The food is seasoned well and the price is good for what you get.  I've been twice in 5 days and plan to go again before I leave.  Wish I could take this establishment back home with me.  The smothered chicken and pork chops was awesome and so tender.  I've also had the fried catfish as well.  All was great!  This place is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Went to Nana's after a friend raved about the food...I dined in during lunch rush. I ordered the rib plate with mac and collard greens; I only enjoyed the collards...the ribs were broiled with BBQ sauce added...talk about a disappointment. The restaurant was clean and spacious.The staff was just okay. Unfortunately Nana will not be at the forefront of my mind when I'm craving soul food."}
{"text":"Delicious! I wish I had one close-by; although, that could be dangerous. 

I had the meatloaf special, green beans, and mashed potatoes. I was hoping to find fried okra on the menu, but the green beans made up for it. They were cooked to perfection, and I'm picky with my green beans. My coworker opted for the catfish and meatloaf or two meat combo. While he enjoyed the catfish, we both expected it to be served with tarter sauce or something of the sort. 

The patio was delightful on a beautiful breezy afternoon as well. Overall, we had a good experience and I definitely recommend giving Nana's a try!"}
{"text":"I don't see it. Went here once for breakfast and once for lunch. Neither were good. Place is clean and the staff is great. Food was mediocre at best. Much better soul food places within a ten minute drive."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ ribs, pork chop with collard green and and mac and cheese as a side. It was great! 
They even allowed us to sample their dishes before ordering.

If you like soul food/comfort food, then this is your best option in the city of Charlotte.

Not to forget, I came to the restaurant with my wife and friends, so I had the opportunity to eat a little of the other servings. Their catfish was great; fresh."}
{"text":"Just flew in from Orlando and happened upon Nana's.  I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens, a roll and sweet potato pie.  I made the mistake of trying the collard greens first.  I swear it felt like angels dancing on my tongue!  I've never had better and swear I felt a tear welling up in my eye.  I thought it would be all downhill from there.  Nope!  The fried chicken was crispy, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  The roll was not homemade and tasted like every other roll you've ever had - which made me wonder why serve them at all.  It's like hanging an air freshener in a new Ferrari.  Nonetheless, it all ended with the homemade sweet potato pie.  Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Great service and clean establishment. They take calls prompt and accurately. I enjoy the fish because it is made to order. The yams are delicious and sweet. For the price you get what you paid for. I usually share a platter with my co workers. So far I will only come here for soul food."}
{"text":"This review is a bit overdue (a few months).  But better late than never right?

We stopped by Nana's Soul Food Kitchen when we were traveling through Charlotte.  Here are the highlights:

+  Not busy
+  Restaurant was clean
+  Employees were very pleasant and friendly
+  Food was reasonably priced
+  Flavors were authentic 
+  Portions were HUGE!!! 

We will definitely be stopping by again the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"We were in town for a Panthers game, and were looking for some quick good food.  Although I'm from the Boston area, I'm a big fan of southern food (although my experience with true southern soul food is probably limited).  What I do know is that for fast food, this food was awesome.  The business model essentially presents the customers with a wide variety of prepared main dishes and sides.  The main dish offerings included Chicken (fried, backed, bbq, jerk, curry, bourbon), Ribs, smothered pork chop, fried catfish, meatloaf, others.  Sides include Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage, Cole Slaw, Collard Greens, Cucumber Salad, Curry Chicken Rice, Fried Okra, Green beans, Lima Beans, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Pinto Beans, Potato Salad, Stuffing, White Rice, Yams, and others.  

You can get a small or large dish.  Small is 1 meat, large is 2.  I got a large plate with Fried Chicken and Smothered Pork Chop.  For sides I got cabbage and black eyed peas.  My son got BBQed ribs with Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens.  Everything was truly excellent.  I was most surprised by the pork chop, which was moist and flavorful.  I love good fried chicken, and this was pretty good.  The Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas were amazing also.

Not only would I go back, but we actually did the next night for some take out dinner after the football game.  I'm sure there are other great soul food place out there, but for quick sit in or take out, I don't think you can do better."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious. The Platters are huge. My husband and I were in Charlotte for a short overnight business trip and we were looking for some good soul food. You know the kind that makes you think that somebody's Grandmama was in the back cooking. Nana's Soul Food Kitchen did not disappoint. As soon as we walked in and peruse the huge menu with every single side you could imagine we must have looked overwhelmed because they asked us if this was our first time and they would go over everything with us. So welcoming and so nice to deal with my indecisive husband about what he wanted. I was very impressed that the young woman serving behind the counter was able to name all 18 side items in a row. I told her she deserves an award for that. We were feeling extra greedy so we had a little bit of everything. We had the barbecue jerk Wings which was the special for the day macaroni and cheese collard greens potato salad smothered pork chop and catfish. Of course we weren't even able to put a dent in all that food but tasted everything and it was amazing. The desserts were pretty solid as well. As I sit here and write this review while my husband packs up our stuff to check out and head home we are seriously considering hopping over to Nana's as soon as they open to get some food to take home. Will definitely be visiting the spot the next time we come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very good food, very friendly and professional service. They accommodated our party of 40 with no problem. We called ahead and told them what time we would be there and they had every one fed within a matter of minutes. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some good soul food in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great food and welcoming staff. Shae was very nice and patient bc deciding on all the great sides was so hard. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Outstanding! We were staying at a nearby hotel and the shuttle bus driver recommended Nana's, and man was he right. My wife and I split the large plate with Jerk chicken, Fried chicken, mac & cheese and greens. Friendly staff, great food at a great price. A real winner!"}
{"text":"Yes the food here was decent, the ribs not so great, had that baked BarB-que flavor, nothing like authentic grilled or smoked.  We both found the curried chicken to be outstanding though.  Great flavor, perfect medium heat a really nice entree, highly recommended !  The green beans were typical old style southern overcooked green beans that you would expect from soul food, but the nice thing about them is that neither they nor the collards were overly salted.  The employees were all really nice and that always matters.  Nothing fancy here as its cafeteria style so don't expect any old southern charm in ambiance or anything fancy, that was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they use a store brand BBQ sauce. There are way too many better places than this."}
{"text":"First, for a place with a serving line, paper plates and cups, they were pretty pricey. We went to this restaurant on our way to our hotel, tired and hungry, personally soul food is not my \"thing\" but I am not a very picky eater. I got the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and Mac and Cheese, I also got to try some of the collard greens of someone else in my group. The mashed potatoes and collard greens were very good, while everything else was too seasoned, to the point I couldn't eat it, and ended up having to get a sandwich somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow, this place is so good. Great family run place. Clean and delicious. We will be coming back next time we're in the area. The best stuffing I've ever had. Bourbon chicken was the special and it was so good."}
{"text":"I'm a NC native so naturally I LOVE soul food. This is right across the road from work & a great place for a hearty lunch (not good for you but good to you) The fried chicken, mac n' cheese and fried okra is tasty. Buffet style line with generous portions & they also have good sweet tea."}
{"text":"We tried Nana's last night. We ordered fried chicken, yams, pulled BBQ chicken, cabbage, collard greens, and curry rice. We were very disappointed in the food but not the service. The fried chicken was dry, the BBQ chicken had the basic grocery store sauce, the greens were sweet, the cabbage was bland without any seasoning, and the yams were out of a can and too sweet. The cake seemed to be store bought. Cooking soul food takes heart and skill. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Finally was able to stop into Nana's for lunch today.  This location joins Salsarita's and YuYu's at the corner of Oak Lake and Tyvola.  We arrived around 1:00pm in the afternoon and the restaurant was probably 40% filled.

I ordered the Fried Chicken small plate lunch, which entitled me to two pieces of fried chicken (leg and breast), two sides and choice of bread and drink.   I chose the mac and cheese and the green beans along with cornbread.

The chicken was juicy, but lacked something in the taste.  The mac and cheee was smooth and mild, but tasty.  The green beans were okay.  The cornbread was pretty dry though.  And hard.  The total for my meal came to eight bucks and change.

I will definitely consider coming back as they have a bunch of options for their \"meat and two\" and they begin serving breakfast 04/11/11.  The service was great (cafeteria style) and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese is incredible.  I had fried chicken and BBQ ribs.  The chicken was perfect crispy and juicy once bit into.  The pork rib's meat was falling off the bone and was delish!  I overheard another patron say, \"this is Sunday dinner cooking without all the work.\"  That's the best description for Nana's.  Yum!"}
{"text":"During a work trip to Charlotte at the beginning of the month, I was on the lookout for eateries close to my hotel. My trusty Yelp app led me to Nana's. During my 6 days in Charlotte, I ate here twice! I had the one meat combo which came with two sides and your choice of cornbread or dinner roll, and a drink. Also for approx $10. Pretty reasonable, I thought. Both times I had the curry chicken which was fall off the bone tender and flavorful and mac n cheese (good) as one of the sides. For the second side, the first time I had the steamed cabbage (bland) and second time, had the rice (spicy but good). Corn bread was okay. I also had the red velvet cheesecake and other time had chocolate cake. Yes, I was definitely indulging on this work trip!

For what can be a sleepy business park location during dinner time, this place was always busy. Employees were very friendly and that chicken was sooooooo good. If I ever return to that area, I have to make a pit stop at Nana's."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese is off the Hook----

Haha, if that doesn't get you excited then I'm sure there is something on the menu that will. 

Set up in a cafeteria/food court style, you're served up some hot juicy soul from behind the counter. My first time in I tried the ribs, very fall off the bone, and good sauce. I choose the greens and the mac and cheese as my sides. I love the mac and cheese, it's creamy, gooey and leaves you wanting more..how dare they :)


The second time in I snagged up the fried chicken and stuck with the same sides. I'm not sure if I'll get this again (I think I was playing it safe) but it was good. 
Corn bread is on and off, sometimes its very moist - others it may be a tad dry.
 
As for the dessert, I've only seen people order it but I'm dying to try the Red Velvet Cake, guess I'll have to come in again!"}
{"text":"Dank food!!! But a little pricey. Definitely worth the try though. We found Nana's on the way to dropping our brother off at the airport, its around a 3-5 minute drive from there. We walked in on a Friday, the special jerk chicken was finger lickin delicious. I swear, one of the best chicken recipes I have ever had. The mac and cheese was good, not the best, but still satisfying. The mashed potatoes were creamy. My brother ordered a side of fried okra but had to wait a while as it was being fried. It was a little under-seasoned but the hot sauce fixed that up. 

I was tempted to try the desserts but alas, I did not have time. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food spot in Charlotte. Yep. I said it lol. Monday - Friday they have a daily meat special. Yet, everyday you can guarantee a hot bar full of great options such as black eyed peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, yellow rice, dressing, and more. All prices include the drink. And when you check out, don't forget to check behind the counter for dessert options. 
Pro Tip 1: ask for a sample if you aren't sure. They will give it to you. 
Pro Tip 2: mix your sweet tea with the lemonade"}
{"text":"I ordered the food from here for my Family Reunion this past weekend. I wanted to serve up some \"soul food\" so we had Fried Chicken, Baked Chicken, Green Beans, Collard, Mac& Cheese, Rice and Gravy, Corn muffins and Banana Pudding....When I tell you that EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious I am not exaggerating. Not only did I enjoy but my family couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. Thanks Nana's."}
{"text":"I went with the smothered pork chops, mashed potatoes, and fried okra... absolutely delish! The reason I did not give them five star was that my fried okra must had been fried about five hours earlier. The portion was perfect. I would definitely give them another shot!"}
{"text":"The chicken was delicious. The cabbage was a little too salty and had an odd bright green-yellow coloring. The macroni cheese was pretty good but had scorched looking lumps in it but it didn't taste burnt. The cake tasted commercialized. The love and concern was the missing element for this experience."}
{"text":"Gee whiz. This place is worth the hype. I am in from out of town and wanted aome genuine Southern soul food.
I ordered a small dinner ($10.99) and a slice of cake (4.99). I got 3 fried wings, mac n cheese and collard greens, with a corn muffin and drink. The wings were good. They had a slight over smell of grease, but it did not interfere with the taste. I like my chicken fried hard, and they did not disappoint.
The mac and cheese was a small portion ( good for us watching our carb intake) and I am still trying to decide what kind of cheese was used. It was extremely smooth like Velveeta. Lord please say it wasnt.
The star of the show were the collards! Cooked thorough, seasoned with a hint of sweetness. I never had sweet greens. Not overpowering, just slight. Delicious!
The cake is tasty, moist and just the right amount of icing. I hate thick icing. I think the cake was a box mix. Im not sure. But I am sure that $5 was too much for it. Knock it down to $3.50. 
You get a cup to select your own drink from the fountain. I combined ice tea and lemonade.
The staff is very friendly, and the place is spacious to accomodate a large group comfortably. I highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"If you're in the Charlotte area and are looking for Soul Food, this is a good place to check out. It's in a nice location, right near the highway and the Renaissance hotel. The restaurant is spacious. It's clean. The menu selections are broad and the prices are comparable to the portions you get. They don't put pork in the collard greens and there is a lot to choose from if you are a vegan. My only concession with this place is they use cheap plastic plates when you dine in. For a business of this caliber, I would suggest using real plates and silverware. Not only is it conducive to the environment, it's simply more tasteful. They give you a lot of food and it was hilarious to see the line cook take extra time to ensure that the food wouldn't don't drop off of the plastic plate. Other than that, I was pleased. They have TV's for you to look at and they come around and check on you, which is cool."}
{"text":"I went there for the soul food, and ended up with so-so food.

In town for just 1 night (Thursday) and was searching for a place to eat.  Saw some reviews of Nana's, and went there eagerly anticipating bourbon chicken, meatloaf, and some sides.

I review the menu on the wall, and there are my choices.  Ok.  \"Bourbon chicken please.\"  \"Oh sorry, that's only available Tuesday.\"  Hmmm.  Ok.  \"Meatloaf please.\"  \"Yeah, that's available on Monday.\"  Grrrrr.  Ok.  \"Jerk chicken?\"  \"Wednesday.\"

Oh come on!

I'm on a low carb, high protein diet, so some of the other items were just not allowed on my diet, such as chicken alfredo, fried chicken, etc.  So I ordered baked chicken.  Baked chicken.  The same baked chicken I make for myself 4 nights a week.  I also ordered catfish.

Sides.  Hmmm, lemme see.  \"Okra please.\"  \"We don't have okra.\"  This is a soul food place right?  Southern cooking?  No fried okra?  I mean, really?

So I grabbed a couple random sides and sat down.  Chicken was juicy and delicious.  Sides were cucumbers and tomato (very spicy for some reason) and black eyed peas.  Good.  The catfish was inedible - I started digging into the VERY HARD, VERY THICK batter to find some actual catfish meat, and found little.  The breading was so tough, so thick, that it was like chewing on sandpaper.  I just gave up.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I just ate here on my way out of town.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Big selection.  Great food.  The fried chicken was as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I had an overnight layover in Charlotte and stayed at the Hyatt. When I inquired about nearby food options Nana's Soul Food Kitchen was recommended. It was literally just a walk across the parking lot to an amazing meal that tasted as if it were home cooked. The portion sizes were generous and the prices were fair. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"Not impressed as some other reviewers. Being very versed in southern soul food, this place wasn't horrible but didn't hit the bar for me. Now, to be fair, it may just be a difference in receipes but the collards were more sweet than saturated in vinegar (never heard of sweet collards before and never wish to again), the roll was warm and soft, and the macaroni...oh the macaroni; There's no other word for it..... GAR-BAhGE (please say it how it is spelled). I cannot put my finger on it but it just was not right man, it wasn't right. I'm no a big rib fan so this was probably my fault but I didn't particularly care for the ribs either. As ribs typically seem to be, they lacked a good amount of meat and were a bit on the dry side. The two stars are for the baked chicken which wasn't bad. My boyfriend had the curry chicken and ate a good amount of it so I can assume that it was decent but seeing as how he did not rant and rave as he usually does when something is spectacular, I would assume it was sufficient and that's about it. The location isn't bad, they have a nice area where you can sit outside and enjoy the day but I will not be returning to this establishment. In my opinion, Sunset Soul Food over on Beatties Ford Road is MUCH better (get the collards!)."}
