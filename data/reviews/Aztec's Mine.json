{"text":"Aztec's Mine is really close to my house so I order takeout a lot. I've been pleased to see its progress over the year-ish that it has been open. It went from a very small and humble menu with no liquor license and no entertainment to a place that is vibrant with a big fresh menu, alcoholic drinks now on offer, and wonderful upbeat music and entertainment to enjoy while you dine. The outdoor patio has gotten bigger too and is very nice to relax on. 

I go usually for the burrito's but have also enjoyed the Pozole, Tacos, and Chilaquiles.

The most remarkable thing about this spot is the friendly customer service. I believe it is family owned and staffed and they always serve me with a smile. Even if I come in for a takeout order they seat me at a table, offer me water and make me feel at home.

Great neighbourhood place!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Bloor west!! Been meaning to go here for ages and I wasn't disappointed. Except I wish I had come sooner and in summer for the patio. 
Mexican chorizo tacos were my fav!! Although the guacamole is home made and beautiful too. 
Owners are super nice and make you feel like you're in their home kitchen. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Authentic flavours and friendly staff. A little overrun on what is probably its first night but we'll be back"}
{"text":"Decided to take my fianc√© for a morning brunch last summer, we haven't had Mexican before and this place did not disappoint; great ambiance and great service. We had the guacamole tortilla chips for appetizers. The Enchiladas de Mole was incredible, and Huevos Rancheros was very tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience eating something that resembles and tastes like back home. Very authentic in taste and feeling. 

I had the enchiladas rojas and the only thing I'd suggest, would be to make them spicy like in my home city."}
{"text":"Tried the place on a sunny day where I felt like Mexican and beer.  I did take out.  The place was nice and neat, and the staff seemed friendly.  Average amount of wait time and the price was okay.  The food was good - nothing really amazing, maybe because it was take out and I did not eat it fresh?  Anyways, would go back if I was in the location."}
{"text":"Received great service here. You're a lot of really interesting varieties of tacos I was really craving a chimichanga however they didn't have the variation that I know and love from chimichangas restaurant formally (Young and Eglington now closed).
The food was very flavorful very authentic. Worth checking out if you're in the High Park area"}
{"text":"Small, family-owned and great tacos! Live music on weekend evenings too. Definitely try the mixed tacos and guacamole, and you can't beat the view of the park. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go here! Great food, very friendly people, good live music on Saturdays (at a civilized volume!).  Very relaxed. They've had to live through the condo construction across the street for a few years and now they'll be rewarded with more business when people start moving in. I had the Pozole (spicy chicken and hominy stew) and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for years for a Mexican restaurant in the area - and family run Aztec's Mine does not disappoint!  We had dinner there last night - started with the guacamole and chips - very tasty.  The chips were fresh, not greasy or too salty. We split an Enchilada Verdes and 4 tacos: 2 beef and 2 pork pibil. The quantity was good and the food tasted excellent.  The place was clean,  the staff very friendly and attentive. We will return!"}
{"text":"It reminded me of our time in Mexico.  very authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. 

I had been avoiding going, because I somehow got the vibe that it wasn't authentic Mexican. 

I was wrong. 

It is simple and no frills, but there is someone cooking the food who knows what's up and the dishes are totally solid. 

I am definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I ate all my  Barbacoa Tacos (lamb) and that's 4 pieces of yumminess in my plate!!! I usually don't finish my dish, surprisingly did! Even my Dad and Bf. My bf inhaled the Flan, which was freshly made in the restaurant by the owner's wife. I just LOLed!!! Highly recommended! Nothing but love for this Gem! See you guys soon!!!"}
{"text":"So many trendy places do tacos that I've become used to a sub- par product masquerading as awesome behind hip decor. 
Aztec's Mine flips this on its head.
Nice but basic restaurant - amazing, authentic tacos. Try # 9: chorizo cooked with beer and tequila. Also liked the pastor which had fresh pineapple. 
Good Guac and margueritas at a reasonable price.
And they were nice to the kids with us. 
Tacos were the star however- give them a try!"}
{"text":"Food, specifically the tacos we tried, were not great. They used fresh ingredients but flavour and taste was below average. For the location it's never that busy in there. The older man (owner?) tries to be nice and funny but he's old school and actually can come off as rude or without tact. Not worth going back."}
{"text":"I am so happy i found a Mexican place close to me without going downtown. I had the tinga taco platter and my boyfriend had the fish tacos. Just some things to keep in mind... the tacos are quite small, probably 11 or 12 cm diameter, but for the price you are full after three tacos, so the fourth is like a bonus :). The fish tacos are not deep fried like the baja fish tacos in Kensington :(.

They have a patio and every Saturday they have live music. So definitely can't wait to come back in the summer.

I'll probably get the assorted taco platter next time, and chips and salsa and guacamole but most likley will not try anything else. Like another reviewer said, they do lack freshness. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients aren't stale, but it doesn't have the Kensington Market taco taste, and nothing can beat those."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 7 on a Friday night, wasn't too busy and were seated quickly by the friendly and attentive server. They recommended guacamole which wasn't on the menu, and it was delicious - chunky and bursting with flavour, and the chips were freshly made. 

We had the Tacos al Pastor with cilantro, lime and pineapple, and the Enchiladas de Mole. The tacos were good - very flavourful and you get 4 tacos per serve, but the tortillas were a little dry. The enchiladas were amazing - delicious mole sauce and moist chicken, plus the serving was huge. Definitely good value for money.

Service was attentive and friendly, water refills were topped up regularly. The waiter informed us they are waiting on their liquor license and will soon open up the patio.

We are glad to have such a friendly and well-priced option with decent food in the High Park neighbourhood, where new options are hard to come by. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, chicken mole, and very friendly staff, was quite slow when we were there so everyone thanked us on the way out"}
{"text":"This place is the best!
The family that runs it is so sweet and the tacos are excellent. The little sombrero they put on their bottled beer cracks me up everytime."}
{"text":"This is a friendly, family-owned, extremely convenient spot in our neighbourhood.  We try to go 1-2 times a week because we love the food and warm service so much.  My own favourites include the Huevos Rancheros and the Enchiladas Rojas, but of course, the tacos are authentic and tasty.  They also have a wonderful breakfast menu.  Great prices, for a very relaxed ambiance across High Park with fantastic service and food."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends on a Saturday at 8 pm. No trouble getting a seat - stools at a tall table for 4 just inside the wide open front wall window, looking across the street to High Park on a beautiful Aug 1st summer evening. The waitress was a wonderfully warm and helpful Chilean lady. The Margaritas were top drawer. We asked for a bit of ice to keep them chilled. happily supplied. the corn chip and Guacamole app was tremendous - perhaps the best Guac I have ever tasted. Tried a range of dishes - tacos,quesadillas,etc - and shared them around. Everyone loved them all, each of us pitching our own order as the best.  $100 for a shared app, 3 mains and 4 cocktails.  If we had to describe the overall food experience, we would say very fresh ingredients, lightly cooked, a surprising cocktail of flavours in every dish. Since it is just around the corner, we will be regulars."}
{"text":"Really 2.5 stars.  For an area that needs good neighborhood dining, I desperately wanted to like this New Mexican but shortfalls are many.  The menu needs to expand, particularly on the apps - this is not a food truck.  $13 for a soup in anything short of a Michelin 2 star is extreme. Ordered the burrito that other reviewers highlighted. The taste was very good, now only if it wasn't stone cold.  The place is new and it has room to improve but will it?"}
{"text":"For anyone who eats mexican regularly, there's nothing remarkable about the food at this small family run business, but it was friendly, quick, comfortable, hearty and affordable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but if I was in the neighborhood I'd definitely stop in. Our family of 4, including 2 young ones had guac, quesadillas, a steak burrito and the mixed tacos and all were good and gobbled up -- as others have mentioned they have a truly kickin' hot sauce - use with care!"}
{"text":"Solid performance! Food came out a tad too fast, but tasted good. They have a mixed taco plate (not on menu!) - all of the 4 piece plates are 11.75 - very attractive. Good enchiladas. Will try something new next time to sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on my way back home getting out of the west end of HighPark subway station, I had the chance to come and I have to say I loved The \"Enchiladas de mole\" the sauce was very good and with the right amount of spice, the guacamole is very good too, didn't ask but I think the tortillas are fried there too, ambiance is nice and staff is very friendly, glad there are these options in Toronto, I hope they keep the taste the way it is now cause I loved it. Definitely coming back and inviting friends."}
{"text":"very small restaurant, better make a reservation for a group
i had the lamb soup and i loved it, a very unique dish and also the shrimp cocktail but i did not like the sweet flavor of the dish"}
{"text":"A hidden gem, just shy of Bloor West village and close to the subway. Homemade Authentic Mexican food. Good customer service friendly staff made for a very enjoyable dinner with family."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good service by the servers ONLY. Unortunately the owner is not aware of customer service. We went there today and ordered enchiladas de mole, which I had before but unfortunately didn't taste all that good here. Sometimes food doesn't taste all that great and I understand. I spoke to the owner about it and he got really rude saying he was going to call the police on me right away. He never even wanted to hear what we wanted to say. We were not looking for a free meal or anything like it but the customer service by owner left a sour taste worse then the enchiladas. Servers were nice and attentive. I feel bad for anyone that works here as the owner has no interpersonal intelligence."}
{"text":"Flavorless and over priced. I came here with my friends and had the chicken tacos and tried the fish and bistro (steak) tacos and guacamole with tortilla chips. All of these dishes were unappetizing, we're not seasoned well, were watery and the soft taco shells tasted old. The tortilla chips were also stale and the guacamole was lackluster. Each dish cost around $14 for 4 tacos.

I was not impressed and would not come back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Servers were good with animated suggestions.  Big portions and heavy meals - awesome."}
{"text":"Huge Taco List on the Menu! 

Very tasting and filling Mexican tacos & quesadillas for lunch, lots of variety of fillings and flavours to chose from. Friendly staff were happy for us to chose where wanted to sit, will return again to try more."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and authentic tasting but the service was a comedy of errors. We always like to try out new restaurants in the neighbourhood, but won't be rushing back here. They've only been open a week and I highly recommend they think seriously about the first impression they are giving customers."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, perhaps I just chose poorly. Ordered a chicken tostada and horchata to go, to eat in High Park. Saddest tostada of my life. Old dried out beans spread thinly on the stale tortilla, shredded chicken with absolutely no seasoning or flavor. Mostly lettuce and few bits cheese, not melted. BLand, cheaply made with no love. Horchata too sugary. 
I know tostadas are not the crown jewel of Mexican cuisine, but it could've been a little better."}
{"text":"Enchiladas Verdes tomatillo sauce has so much sugar in it.
Salsa has so much sugar in it. Tastes like a preserved chili sauce. 
Gringa tastes like it has cumin or curry in it. 
Tocos Al pastor were good enough.
Maybe this is fusion food? This food is so confusing."}
{"text":"Granted this was about a year ago, however, still the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in this city in 20+ years. We ordered veggie tacos since we're both vegetarian. Half way into the meal, I found a giant chunk of chicken in my food. Not cool, but I'm a reasonable human. 
Took another 15 min to get the owner or waiter's attention and let them know. Not only did they not apologize - they actually accused us of lying about ordering vegetarian tacos! As if we had smuggled in meat to put on our own food! Even though we were being super polite about it and never even asked for no charge (though I don't expect to pay for that) we were accused of lying and trying to get food for free! They actually told us not to come back again even though we were nothing short of polite during the whole conversation. 
I would never eat here again or recommend it to anyone. Unrequested chicken aside, there are way better Mexican restaurants in this city than this place. Don't waste your time and money. 
My condolences to the poor family's kids who seem forced to work at their parent' restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is beyond incredible. Had the fish tacos and guacamole. Holy shit!"}
{"text":"food is okay.  customer service was horrible.  forgot to put guacamole in the bag and didnt even apologize upon us coming back.  the manager owner seemed extremely unappreciative of business.  will not come back.
we spent 60 $ i mean at the end of the day they may have a good location but if the business is ungrateful for their customers why would we ever come back there are many mexican places in toronto."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. It is very convenient since its close to the metro station. It is a small restaurant but had plenty of room and some patio space when we went. The service was very good, and the food came out pretty fast. It wasn't the best Mexican food that I have ever had, but for Canada, it is not bad at all. I think it was pretty good overall. Dessert was very good. As we were leaving, live music was just getting started. 

I would definitely go back to this place, as I have had a hard time finding decent or real Mexican food in Toronto. The prices are good and the service is great! I love the area, as it is walkable and has a cool vibe to it. Give it a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Good:

Reasonable price.
Friendly Staff
Portions are large (I had the beef tacos)
Taste (beef tacos were ok. They put potatoes in tacos, which is weird bc I used to go to Mexico often and lived in Southwest;I have never encountered this phenomenon.  It is unusual and I feel mixed about it)

Bad:

Shrimp Cocktail with tortilla chips (they have a fancy name for it but I don't recall) is substandard - way to sweet.  My friend and I ate a bit and decided to not eat any more.  It was a waste of money.  The amount of sugar they put in the shrimp cocktail was unbearable. What a waste of $15.

Verdict: 

If you are in the area, give it a try.  They give you large portions, and tacos are decent.  But if you have to drive more than 15 min to get here, I would consider somewhere else. All their tacos were based on stew meat, instead of grilled or flame broiled meat.   This place had decent food, but based on living in Southwest USA and visiting Mexico often, I have to say that this must be a Canadian rendition of Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Totally just junk food...but barely satisfying. Low quality ingredients and overpriced. Items are hit or miss but even the hits aren't close to a home run. Staff isn't helpful and there were flies."}
{"text":"Place is nothing special but clean, food is average. Definitely some better tacos out there. That being said, authentic and they use fresh ingredients. A little expensive."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, quick service, and very good value!

Been there many times and have yet to have a bad dish. The flautas will easily feed two, and the nachos are mountainous. Highly recommend the pozole and barbacoa soups, the enchiladas verde, and really, any of the tacos.

Be ware of the hot sauce they offer - it really is very spicy!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out as we were heading back from the Cherry Blossom festival at High Park last weekend.  It's next to the subway and we were starving so we swung by for some food.  The place is small but clean and you can sit at the front of the restaurant and people watch all the interesting characters coming out of the subway.

I had the steak tacos which were nice - you get 4, which are a bit on the small side but for me the perfect amount. They were nice but not spectacular.  My friend got the steak burrito and it was YUM!  So much flavour packed into it!  You get 2 and these are a decent size.

We tried the guac and it was nice and fresh and chunky - just the way I like it!  This place is way too far from where I live so for that reason I wouldn't go back there specifically for this place, but if I was in the area I would go for a nibble or two..."}
{"text":"Great little spot ! Authentic Mexican flavours with live music Saturday and Sunday nights. 
The hot sauce is  H O T !  
Tacos are on point and double wrapped (you can split the filling and double your order !
The flautas filled with lamb were amazing and definitely wash it down with Modelo especial.  We find this experience was better expected and will be back"}
{"text":"We loved this place! It is right across from High Park, and have a nice patio overlooking Bloor St. We ordered a variety of tacos and drinks and everything was made very well. 
I tried the shrimp and veggie tacos and they were very delicious. They have very decent portion sizes and have corn tortillas. 
Their service is prompt and excellent."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Mexican joint right next to High Park, where there aren't too many Mexican places.  The prices are good, the patio was still open (better than inside) and the service is quite decent.

The food is quite good, though not as good as Grand Electric.  The tacos are more traditional, and the freshness of the ingredients does not come through as in Grand Electric.  I had a sampler of 3 tacos and my girlfriend had the Pollo Mole.  She didn't understand that Mole is cocoa sauce, so she hated it, but I tried it and it was a good Mole - it is an acquired taste. The tacos were also good, but again, that hint of freshness was not there.

Great place if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food and reasonably priced with a great patio next to High Park. Had the 4 assorted tacos on corn soft tortillas."}
{"text":"Yelp you failed me. Tried the pork tacos. Very dry meat with no veggies. Once the tacos were delivered there was no follow up. Bellyache almost immediately. Also, no A/C. It was very hot. To their credit they were very kind and pointed a fan towards us. And the gentleman was very friendly."}
{"text":"A really great local Mexican place. My husband and I tried the mixed tacos and mole enchiladas and loved both. The mole sauce is made from scratch with a unique family recipe. Truly outstanding. The owners are hard working Mexicans cooking authentically. We just loved it."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5/5

I rarely eat Mexican food so I haven't had much variety nor know many Mexican dishes.

We got nachos with salsa and guacamole. It was surprisingly delicious. I am usually not a fan of any kind of grocery store chip, however, my friend had wanted to order this. The chips here were not salty at all, and had a pleasantly mold taste. The texture was great, perfect thickness and number of waves to pick up dip. The salsa was a bit sweet and the guac tangy. Both were very fresh. Honestly the salsa was the best I've ever had.

I tried enchiladas for the first time. I had no idea what there were or even what they looked like. We chose the Verde (green) which was tangy. It had plenty of strong, flavourful sauce with cheese and sour cream on top. The dish reminded me of pasta. The corn tortillas were double amazingly addicting. My only complaint was that the chicken inside was pretty dry and not easy to cut through.

Lamb tacos: meat was extremely dry and not very flavourful. We felt like we chose a dud. We added some hot sauce and extra nacho salsa on top in an attempt to make it more juicy... The double layered soft corn tortilla though was yum yum yum.

Staff were extremely hospitable and attentive. The women's washroom also had the most intense baby changing station I ever saw. They had everything in there (baby powder, oil, wipes, etc) !! The venue is pretty nice and I guess the prices reflect that too. Our meal was $45 before taxes with the order of chips, enchiladas, and tacos which come with 4 tacos each. 

One other thing to note was that the mini side plates we got kept making our forks fall off onto the table or floor. It's a weird design."}
{"text":"TIP:  Tacos plate comes with 4 tacos and it's waaay more than enough for a serving.  So unless you're super hungry, skip the apps!  You can't really take tacos to-go.

I'll hafta wait until December to know whether or not Aztec's Mine was authentic or not, but it was certainly filling, with very solid portions, without the hefty price tag!  Btw, why are tacos like $6 each in TO??!!

Located across the street from High Park, street parking along Bloor St. was not difficult to come by on a WEEKDAY evening slightly after the dinner rush.  :)

Servers were very friendly and there was also outdoor seating, if you're interested.  Gringos ain't running this joint, so it definitely was no Taco Bell/Chipotle/Burrito Boyz operation!  

We ordered:  Shrimp Cocktail, Mixed Tacos, Bistec Tacos, & I had a Mojito.  I didn't taste the bistec, but my mixed tacos (different stewed meats) were quite good, they do not skimp on the protein here!  Shrimp Cocktail was on the sweet side (ketchup-y?) and came with quite a bit of tortilla chips that we weren't able to finish.  I personally wouldn't recommend that app.  If their fish tacos are any good, I'll most likely orders those next time.

It's too bad that you cannot order individual tacos.

I'd definitely visit again, but skip the apps, get the fish/shrimp/or barbacoa tacos, and op for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Mexican food, this restaurant is definitely on point when it comes to classic traditional Mexican delicacies, the place in bodies everything that you would expect, the prices are so unbelievably reasonable for the size and portions you will receive, I love that they use fresh ingredients like cilantro, in house made salsa and guacamole, freshness is key and this place knows that, The staff is upbeat kind and willing to help you through the menu , my favorite thing on the menu is the fajitas, they also make a really great spicy soup I forget what it's called but it's fantastic it's great for a cold night, but I enjoy eating here anytime of the year it's a really inexpensive restaurant with high-quality ingredients"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Mexican cuisine at this nice family run business near beautiful High Park. The subway is a couple steps from this place which is an added bonus. There is salsa classes once a month and I had the opportunity to listen to their live music artist on a Saturday evening in April. It felt like I was in Mexico. The owner reseated us kindly because we wanted to be by the window. He is so lovely and served us with true Mexican hospitality. His two handsome sons and beautiful wife (who is the head chef) form part of their authentic Mexican experience. This place is a hidden gem along Bloor Street. 

My favourite thing on the menu was the Abenaro hot sauce...not for the faint of heart and you can purchase a bottle for $6. Golden crispy tacos topped with tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, red onions and cheese....hmmm so mouthwatering you want to eat it for days! The best corn chips I've ever had and fresh guacamole made infront of our eyes. It's an open concept kitchen where you can smell all the flavours of Mexico. Their tiny Mexican chewing gum was so cute at the end...truly an authentic Mexican experience here!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want authentic tacos for a really good price! Got a meal for two people and it came out to only $30! 

I recommend the mixed tacos because you get a good variety of what they have to offer. The staff is really friendly and welcoming as well, so overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Decently priced with a big menu. I got the taco sampler which was really good. Extra for guacamole. Nice servers who explained the menu. Nice outdoor seating looking at high Park. Good for people watching. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Aztec's Mine is a great restaurant to head to after a walk in High Park! My favourites are their nachos aztecas, fish tacos, and mojito. The mixed tacos are good too if you want to try different flavours. Prices are very ideal and service is great. 

Tip: don't order too much.. 4 tacos make a filling meal and the nachos aztecas could very much be an entree, not just an app!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and fantastic food. The owner was very friendly, he served us himself at times and had great conversation with us. One of the best Margaritas I had had in Canada. My wife had shrimp tacos, very good. Mother had the tilapia, excellent. I had the Huarache, fantastic. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Saw review on blogto and Yelp to came to this place today for late lunch. Mexican scene in west of toronto is not great but this restaurant is a gem!!! Home made food & not typical restaurant heavy food... Completely loved it & will definitely Visit again. 
Staff was really friendly, service was great& food was amazing."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and reasonable priced food that was also very tasty!
I was there with two friends of mine and vibe was like having a little bit
of Mexico in the city. The best surprise was a live band that performed
as relaxed and enjoyed our drinks. Oh yes almost forgot order a margarita
it's very good."}
{"text":"Service staff was very friendly when we checked in and then just forgot about us.  Food started off poorly with stale tortilla chips that they don't make onsite but guacamole was tasty.  We ordered a posole, hoping to start off with that but they brought it out with our main.  The chicken enchilada mole had great flavour .  chicken chilequiles were quite tasty as well..maybe this is a good take out spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! 

We had lunch on Sunday, food was great, and the mariachi band was awesome!"}
