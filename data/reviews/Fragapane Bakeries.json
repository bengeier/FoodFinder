{"text":"Great sandwiches, pizza, and of course bakery!  However the absolute beat part if Fragapanes is the people!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not get from here. twice I have had their bakery and have twice I have gotten sick. Danish was undercooked. Filling tasted good but last night I was on the toilet all night. I would stay away at all cost. Women who said she was the owner swore at me and hung up when I complained. Totally disrespectful."}
{"text":"The subs and deli use moderate quality (Boar's head) meats, but are piled pretty high. The bakery is ho hum, with some items coming from pre-made boxes. If you are used to NYC little Italy pastries this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Love  this place...always always always get our birthday cakes there. Always fresh and always delicious. Their Italian wedding cakes can't be beat.  We also buy the donuts once in a while for a treat and they are the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts. Great sandwiches. Different special daily. Friendly staff. 

There is a small seating area, but basically takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods and deli sandwiches!! I try to just get what I go in there for but I always walk out with more... I included their take out menu since it's not posted anywhere!"}
{"text":"Walked in here randomly with a huge chocolate craving. Ended up getting a huge chocolate cupcake anx a chocolate eclair. Everything was delicious and very decently priced. I spent less than 3 bucks. Staff was nice. Service was quick."}
{"text":"I love this bakery, not just for their donuts but other items also.  
I used this bakery for my wedding cake back in 2005.  They did a beautiful job on the cake.  This is my husband's favorite bakery also."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this bakery!

Well, I shouldn't lie and say I \"found\" it myself. I received a yelp recommendation a couple of years ago from the great Simon I, but never visited until just recently. Conveniently, Fragapane is located just about 5 minutes from where I work, so I stopped by during my break to check it out.

The SMELLS. First of all. The SMELLS! You can bottle that and sell it. Think bread bakery mixed with sinfully sweet buttercream. Hell yeah.

I tried to take it all in -- the fresh pizza dough, the homemade pasta, and the deli area, but all I could really do was walk straight over to the bakery area. After much debate (and eye candy -- cream puffs the size of a baby's head!), I decided to get a cannoli, a square of white cake with chocolate buttercream, and a few rainbow cookies -- the latter being the gauge by which I judge all Italian bakeries.

My husband got the cannoli, and he said it was amazing because the marscapone wasn't too intensely flavored. He said there's usually something a little too overpowering thrown into the filling, such as cinnamon, or orange, or whatever. But this filling perfectly complemented the shell, which was flaky, not crispy.

The cake. Ok, I have this thing about cake. I lean more toward the Giant Eagle sugary cake than, say, a chocolate mousse cake or a torte. This cake was the BOMB. It had a wonderfully moist texture, and the icing was the kind I dream about. It was incredibly fresh, and sweet without reaching the \"my teeth hurt\" level of sugar. It was perfectly balanced, and for me, there was just the right amount of frosting (although others might think there was too much). Amazing.

Now, the rainbow cookies were something to behold. Six layers. SIX! So delicate, and thin. The chocolate on top was more of a frosting than a fudge. I can't explain how awesome these cookies are. I have an Italian aunt who sends me her rainbow cookies each year, and these beat those (sorry, Auntie).

I'll bet their sandwiches, breads, pastas, etc. are all great too. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I challenge you to find a better bakery in the area that does not have the word 'giant' in the name. I am not big into sweets, but whenever I get a craving, this is the place to go. Cupcakes, donuts, Italian deserts, such a great selection. Everything is fresh, everyday. There's no doubt in my mind that they do not sell things baked the day before. My favorite desert is the eclair filled with vanilla cream, topped with a hazelnut spread. They also help me out for the holidays, I stop here for my freshly baked breads, Italian, pumpernickel, whatever u want, they got it. If your not in the know yet, get there, your missing out."}
{"text":"Just walk in and the smell will instantly make your mouth water. Great deli counter and of course you have to walk past the bakery to get to the checkout. Not a big place but if you are hungry for guilty pleasure food, they will satisfy that hunger."}
{"text":"Grew up in the area and this Bakery has been a staple of the community and is my goto for bakery, deli, and specialty food items.

Family owned and operated, Fragapane's has long been reliable for delivering outstanding service and products.  The variety and quality of their pastries is unmatched.  Delicious and fresh but still rustic and comforting.  Their canolli, eclairs, seven layer cake, danish, donuts, napoleon-its all great.  Bread and rolls too.  
Their potato salad is something of legend to those who know it. It is the best.  Pizza, deli meats and cheeses and other side items are great too.

Ive used Fragapanes over the years to cater many events and their accuracy, timing, and preparation is always superb. Cakes, deli trays, pastry trays etc. always well done with exactly what I order.  

I can't say enough great things about them.  Their commitment to authenticity and quality is unwavering and I prefer patronizing local establishments that provide a warmth and uniqueness thats hard to find in today's economic machine."}
{"text":"Fragapane's is always great! Great pricing on meat and sandwiches.  

I am a big fan of chicken salad sandwich or tuna salad sandwich.  Family owned business, everyone very friendly and attentive at the counter where you order.

Donuts and baked goods are amazing! I usually have to leave with 1 donut."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Fragapane's Bakery since I was a kid some 20 years ago. What I can tell you is that this place is a gem. Nothing beats the chocolate or maple sticks. No one makes them quite like they do. 

We once moved out of Cleveland to Southern California and I asked my now wife to bring Fragapane's out with her and was dead serious. No one gets it. No one makes the vanilla filling like Fragapane's does. Everywhere else it is custard, fruit filling, chocolate mush - no one can make it like Fragapane's. I can't wait to take my kids here some day and have them make similar memories to what I have going after church with my father. Prices are incredible. Staff is great. Shop local. Eat like a king."}
{"text":"Every Friday my amazing husband picks up subs for dinner after work. We call it Fragapane Friday. I have my usual- turkey, pepperoni, onion, lettuce, tomato, Swiss, Italian dressing. It's one of my favorite things in the world. I am weird about lunch meat, & it's one of the few sandwiches I eat that I don't have to dissect first. The sub buns are the best! These massive amazing subs are also only $5.99! I would prefer if the folks reading this stay away from these spectacular subs because sometimes they run out of buns which makes for a sad Fragapane Friday! He also picks up dessert because he's the best husband ever. The 7 layer cake, cannollis... I'm always surprised. It's become a tradition for us & a nice way to end a busy week. Can't say enough good things. Thank you Fragapanes for this weekly tradition. I'd rather have delicious subs & pastries over flowers any day!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The best deli and bakery on the Westside. Their sandwiches are amazing, their salads delicious and their bakery to die for!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sisters because we tasted their Italian wedding cake from the Taste of Cleveland a year ago. We live about twenty minutes away but figuring that we were around the area (Crocker Park), we decided to finally get some of that delicious cake. Not knowing in advance, that cake is pretty popular so coming in at 5, they were out. Even though that was the case, they had other alternatives. They had the raspeberry filling cake, chocolate mousse, donuts, cheesecake, and cookies! They really had a large selection of baked goods. Also, they can make wedding cakes too! In addition, the place is small but with also a diner with some local goods to pick up. Nice local bakery and prices are affordable. A square of that raspberry cake was only $1.30!"}
{"text":"They have the best bread in town. The butter crust bread ruined all grocery store bread for me. Their cannolis are also amazing. I was underwhelmed by the donuts but everything else is worth it."}
{"text":"Great Staff

3 meat combo is choice

usually quick and easy

awesome chip selection

hard to pass up bakery

local gem"}
{"text":"I would like to say \"Thank you so much!\" for the birthday cake I ordered for Saturday (: I asked for the wedding cake with chocolate cake instead white it was so amazingly good! We loved it! I just moved here from Southern California and I found the bakery I will only be going to."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT bakery. Having two locations is key. I love to their core bakery items as well as their seasonal specialities. Take a look at my photo-a picture is worth a thousand words."}
{"text":"Always a great experience and best donuts in Cleveland, Hands down! I go there for all my bakery needs and I always NEED donuts on Sunday when I can! Hopefully the service and quality stays the same because I'm happy whenever I go there!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bakery!

Their prices were amazing to start off with. I left there with fresh Italian bread, 6 cannolis, a cupcake, Cake, and a few custard puffs for under $30. Awesome. 

Anyway the facility itself is okay sort of located in an older strip mall but it's clean inside that's all that counts. The store itself is a little dated but that's okay because you're here for the food not the decor. 

They also serve high-quality lunch meats from boars head. That is one of the best lunch meat brands you can get. With homemade and imported pastas on the shelves is a great place for any sort of European-style meal. 

All in all a great place so make sure to add them to your grocery shopping!"}
{"text":"Every year we get our holiday treats and cookies from here. They never disappoint and they are consistently great. I love the seven layer cookie/cake."}
{"text":"I have to say my last trip to this bakery was a huge disappointment. I stopped in to pick up some desserts for a dinner party - cheesecake squares and chocolate cake squares - and when it came time to eat them that evening they tasted awful! I was so embarrassed that I served these to my guests. We ended up throwing them all away not one of us could stomach them! What a waste of money!! I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great local deli (and bakery!)  Ask anyone at my work and they will tell you this is a five star place! Their sandwiches are HUGE! And cheap! And fresh!  They have a home-style lunch special everyday and we're always amazed at how huge and delicious they look!  

They use Boar's Head brand meats (every kind you can think of!) and cheeses and you could take the meat off one sandwich and make two!  You can get a sub, white, wheat or rye bread.  They let you order whatever, however you want.  Some basic toppings are free.  Some are 25 cents or so extra.  They'll even let you order 1/2 a sandwich, and pay accordingly!  

They have HUGE slices of pizza too!  You must try the potato salad - it's the best (don't tell my grandma!)  In the colder months, they have soup and the wedding soup is excellent.  

The whole store is pretty awesome.  You can buy an array of Italian pastas and dough, imported beer, and little unique items you don't really come across anywhere else.

And yes, their desserts are delicious.  And no matter how hard you try you can't miss them on your way out.  They're in a huge bakery window.  I recommend the éclairs and the multi-colored layer cake.  Those are my favorites.

Everyone that works here is really nice and friendly too.  They get a nice little rush around lunch time and everyone seems to remain pretty calm.  

If you've never been, you have to stop in!  It really is a local favorite but beware: They're closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Always the best pastries around!"}
{"text":"This seems like a usefull place to have in the area. It's an Italian deli with a bakery counter as well as good selection of food, including in-house-made pizza. My friend and I tried out their pepperoni pizza first since it was lunch time. The slice was so large that we asked them to cut it in two and it was ridiculously cheap, like less than $3 cheap. The pizza itself was honestly pretty average, I've had way better and I've had worse. But if you're in the area and you need something quick to eat that won't be too expensive, definitely stop here.

After that we clearly needed dessert so we got a blueberry donut to split, a lemon cake pop for me and a s'mores cake pop for her and she got a cannoli to go. The donut was also pretty average, not too dense. My lemon pop was a disappointment. It had white chocolate(?) coating and the inside was mostly very sweet cookie dough with a small dollop of lemon custard. There wasn't enough of the lemon custard and it was overall very sweet - I would have liked it to be a bit more tangy. My friend loved her s'mores cake pop, sweetness and all, so maybe it was just me. 

Overall, I wouldn't say make the drive but if you're in the area then stop by!"}
{"text":"Buy the frozen pizza dough, add some pastries, and all will be right in your world."}
{"text":"Large tossed salad with cheese for $4.50 is the absolute best lunch in all of North Olmsted.  It is filled with ham. various cheeses, pepperoni, turkey, and of course lettuce, olives, and occasionally a tomato or two with choice of dressing. I am a big fellow (see profile picture) and I have trouble finishing it some days and yet - I'm eating salad! It's got to be good for me, right?  Oh yes, I said some days as I eat this nearly every day except for Monday when, alas, Fragapane's is closed.  You must get there early (before 12:30) as they often sell out of the salad and other made fresh each day lunch specials (today's was pepper steak but of course I had a salad).  The business is well staffed with very nice employees who really seem to care about the customers and love what they do.  Sometimes I will bring back a box of fresh baklava or cannolis for my staff as an afternoon snack."}
{"text":"This place was super legit. Their staff was hella nice. I ordered a turkey sandwich and it was 5.49, and it was loaded with meat and all the fixing.. The girls that work there are hot too and coo, I would try the potato salad, i've never had anything like it before. Will go back any time im in the area. So legit. Gotta try it one,  i bet you back for more.Truly a classic italian deli."}
{"text":"Fragapane is one of the best bakeries on the NW side of town. I've been to the one in Bay, but for some reason when I'm in the area, I never forget to drop in. 

The staff is always friendly even when they are all busy at the deli making sandwiches or slicing up cold cuts for their customers. You will always get a big smile out of them, or is it looking at my face and seeing me pulling out my Coach wallet? (ha)

Each time I've gone into purchase cake, cookies, cupcakes, or other goodies they were always fresh. Their cannoli is so good that I cannot wait to get home and get something to drink with it. The carrot cake, German chocolate cake, donuts, this place is superb. I'm particular about my desserts, so if they didn't past the \"Coop Test,\" I would never return.

One negative about the bakery. Don't eat too many cannoli over the winter season or else you will not be able to fit in those shorts come summer time."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great bakery items, awesome deli. They have amazing sub sandwiches. EXCEPT, every time we go there now they have no sub buns. How can you offer sub sandwiches, but have no sub buns. Make more!!"}
{"text":"Every year I get my son's birthday cake from here. The cassata cake! Best dang cake I've ever had. The cake is always fluffy, the frosting isn't over powering sweet, and the strawberries are huge! There is always a huge line on weekends because everyone is going to get their baked goods for their weekend festivities. I have had a deli sammich, just a turkey one, nothing special but the bread was fantastic. I also tried my first cannoli recently. And holy cannoli. It was fantastic. They're not over priced, fairly reasonable. I mean if u want cheap stick to Giant Eagle. If you want quality, then expect to pay just a bit more. I think my sons cassata cake was about $20. Which is a great price for what you're getting. I have had some of their pasta salads and those are good as well. Cupcakes are great and again, frosting isn't over powering. Their pizza... is good hot or cold. I usually buy 4 pieces to go and eat them throughout the day. I can't wait to go there this weekend and get some pastries!"}
{"text":"Great deli. They carry boars head meats and cheese which in my opinion are the best. Try the fragabomb, see if you can finish it!"}
{"text":"As a pizza conoisseur, having sampled truly great pizza in NY, Jersey, Chicago, and in Europe, I have to say that this is, quite possibly, some of the BEST pizza in NE Ohio (top 3)!  Thick, authentic 'sicilian style' slices (known as 'squares' in Brooklyn, NY), fresh tasting sauce with just the right amount of zest, cheese that literally oozes and flows like volcanic lava, and a seriously PERFECT thick and airy crust!  And let's not forget, the pastries are 'to die for' too!  Their deli salads (especially their tortellini or crab salad) are fantastic as well.  I can't believe i've been living in the same town as Fragapane's for 17 years, and have never gone there until this year!  Shame on me!"}
{"text":"I found this on Yelp and sort of randomly stopped by. I love the small grocery section - great way to pick up a few ingredients for certain kinds of food. They have micro brewed soda and chips I have never tried - plentiful to buy!

Their deli and bakery counters are the main attractions - and for good reason. I found at least half a dozen bakery items I wanted to try. It was all I could do to get out of there with just 2 this time. 

And they have lots of different sandwiches and other food items - including a pepperoni roll that looks phenomenal. They also have fresh bread that you can have sliced. In other words, this is where you want to be when a blizzard threatens to keep you indoors for a while.

Overall, I can easily see why this place has been in business for so long. They have delicious food that you can't easily find elsewhere and not crazy expensive. My only wish is that they had a real seating area so that I could have lunch and a dessert right there."}
{"text":"Paczki are seriously the best! So so good!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, hoping the service & pizza would be better each time but no luck. The lady in the deli is downright rude. The pizza is too salty and the crust is stale (all three times-not on just one occasion). I got a frosted sugar cookie and threw it out after one bite because the cookie tasted like a piece of cardboard. Maybe their other items are better, but based on my past three experiences I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Ordered a sheet cake by phone for my mom's 90th birthday party. Yellow cake with chocolate frosting. I sent an example photo. They said the cake person would call back. They didn't. I arrived in town and visited the bakery to follow up. Staff pulled the order, we went over it. I asked for gardenia flower on top. Told them there is a YouTube video for tip size and frosting colors, plus building the gardenia. The chocolate frosting was a pale brown, not like the example photo, dark. The gardenia was a tiny quarter-sized attempt on the top. Not impressed. It was okay for $70.00"}
{"text":"They have the best napoleons (7 layer bars)! We have ordered them for bridal shower and wedding! They taste great and fresh, and looked perfect too!"}
{"text":"My BFF & I stopped in for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  I never expected a full delicatessen and I was quite surprised.  The staff was helpful, the corned beef sandwich was so lean and so tasty, and the potato salad was out of this world.   I've  been dreaming about that stuff for the last two weeks... thats how good it is!  I won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! I bought my family from out of town donuts from here and they were a hit I also took some of my friends here to get lunch one day because their subs and pasta salad are fantastic and I just love the atmosphere here everyone is very attentive and make sure every experience is great! They have a lot of baked goods to choose from and I haven't had something I haven't liked yet!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit my mother in Cleveland I visit this bakery.  It is a good, sturdy, traditional bakery that I confess my addiction.  The buttercream frosting (which is a main yardstick of measure for me when it comes to bakeries), is excellent. Mind you, it isn't real buttercream, they use shortening, but it's a great frosting.  Their cakes and pastries are great.  

Their pizza is respectable, with a healthy distribution of cheese and toppings.  Their cookies, again, shortening instead of butter, are great.  This isn't Olivier's Le Bonne Bouchée, but it's a good sturdy bakery."}
{"text":"We ordered their 5' sub sandwich & 2' veg sub sandwich & Cole slaw for our party. It was a big hit & we had the best leftovers!
Very generous portions of Boars Head meats & cheeses. Delicious !"}
{"text":"This place has awesome sandwiches. I got the classic but switched the ham out for corned beef instead. UUUHHHHMAZING. Lots of meat and veggies and tons of food for 5.99. It was awesome. They also had a lot of baked goods and assorted side dishes as well as lots of pasta and sauce like you get at a grocery store but more authentic italian brands. Definitely worth the trip."}

O heavy cow...O chicken light.
In truth, a mis-matched pair. 
Yet try as I might, cannot recall,
A lovelier couple...I swear.

With little effort ye each succeed,
in presenting us thy gift.
Whether squirting or plopping,
Ye do it well.  Proficient, ah!...and swift.  

O fresh eggs and heavenly butter,
Fine cheeses and creams, O my !
Just add some sugar and flour...
Fruits and nuts?...O I'm trem-bling to try !

Tear into that sweet apple strudel !
O Cannoli !  So luscious...No lie !
Cream-filled eclair...thou're stupendous !
Now a slice of that custardy pie !

Alas....and anon... I'll be sorry,
For indulging in pastries divine.
With behavior befitting a glutton,

I'm responding to a 5/18/12 review.     
I don't know why he was untruthful, but I couldn't 
let his comment go unaddressed.  To deliberately 
disparage a reputable business by posting false 
information is inexcusable, and I feel it's the respon-
sibility of conscientious reviewers to speak up.   He 
claims that their buttercream is not butter, but short-
ening.  I confirmed this as untrue by contacting 
Fragapanes.  When they say something is butter-
cream, they use BUTTER---never shortening.   

.
Actually, I partook of a very small sampling of each.  A celebratory occasion was responsible for this stumbling, tumbling fall into sweet weakness, and will NOT be repeated for at least another hour...maybe two.   (no.) 

I'm generally not drawn to bakery, but I was accompanied to Fragapanes by someone who IS---and I'm a pushover.   It had been a few years since I'd purchased any dessert-type item from this fine establishment, and todays wagon-load reminded me why.  IT'S ALL SO POSITIVELY DELICIOUSLY ADDICTIVE !   If you've never been here, you're really missing out on how excellent baked goods should always taste.  

If planning any special occasion, such as Birthday, Anniversary, Shower, or even lawn-mowing, carpet cleaning, or TV channel-changing, Fragapane Bakery is the one and ONLY place to consider.    You'll score major points:   Those who couldn't stand your guts will follow you around like a puppy.   Mothers-in-law who never thought you were good enough will seek out some loophole they can legally slip through just to formally adopt you as one of their own.   Overnight---among your so-called friends---you WILL become the Most Interesting Man (or Woman) in the World.     And all this for just a few cannoli's or chocolate covered eclairs?   Now THAT'S an excellent value.

(Don't forget to pick up some potato salad !)

{"text":"As always they delivered fabulous cookies! I had gone to another bakery near where I was at in Berea,  the experience was horrible and I left and drove straight here knowing they'd have what I needed. My cookies were a hit in my cookie exchange and even had people asking where I got them so they could get them for parties they were having!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Have been on a sandwich kick lately as I drive around for my real eatate biz. Sandwiches have great bread, generous portions of meet and good condiments and sides. I would come back here again for more and to try their pastries."}
