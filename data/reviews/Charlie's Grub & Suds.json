{"text":"We stopped for the first time at this establishment on the way back from Fairmount.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and see the interesting decor.  There are several die cast models of vintage cars in display cases.  There are multiple timeless signs and character pictures on all of the walls.  The bar is separated from the entertainment area, which has a pool table, foosball table, air hockey table and some other games to enjoy.  The service is excellent and the food is very good.  I will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome grub! I enjoy the pizza and bread sticks the most. Good variety of toppings too. Would recommend it if you are in town."}
{"text":"This is s great place. It's a charming small town restaurant and the staff are nice and super friendly. I had the deep dish and the ingredients were super fresh. It's not the same taste as Chicago deep dish, but still really yummy. The is cool. Car models and old beer signs along the walls. Down side is no beer on draft but they have a wide selection of bottles. Your popular brands mostly. Great place for families they have games to play. It's a seat yourself place FYI."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, good pricing, what more could you want! A little outside of champaign but worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza yes. The deep dish pizza, no. Sandwiches yes, appetizers yes.  If you are going to be passing through Homer, use the GPS to figure out when you're going to hit town, call in your order, and have them make it ready for pickup exactly when you're going to be there. That works like a champ, hot and fresh pizza and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great little place in Homer. We had the thin crust pizza which was good. Staff was very friendly and the owner came to our table to chat. Decor consisted of a great collection of beer mirrors. The beer was cold, the pizza was good, and the staff was friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a great little place in Homer.  The fellow who owns the business is friendly and they provide great service! Usually when I visit my son's house, il grab a small Pizza. And I've always felt welcomed!"}
