{"text":"Open fires and live music! We stayed until the fire wood ran out. Just a great place to spend a cool Saturday night. Yes Amanda took care of us like it was her own place."}
{"text":"Service, food quality, price, organization, attention to detail, pride, appreciation of customer all horrible.  Even manager admitted things are bad and offered our group a PBR to make up for the cold meal and terrible service.  Who's running this???????? What a waste of potential."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a work happy hour or with a big group of friends. It is very spread out and has a very chill kind of atmosphere. It is definitely rough during the summer time and I am pretty shocked they do not have more misters but even in August it was not unbearable."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  The first couple of times they were getting the bugs out of the system since they were brand new and had some problems with getting their kitchen ovens to work so the menu was limited to items off the grill (which were still tasty).

The last time I was there they nailed it.  Everything was working correctly and the food, service, and atmosphere were nice.  It isn't a fancy place, it's a kick back and relax place that is kid friendly until 10PM.  If the sight of seeing children running around having fun will send you into a tizzy, this is not the place for you.

It's just a fun place where you can listen to music, have some drinks, and eat some nice bbq."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it has a very cool vibe.  It is mostly all outdoors, and there are two full bars.  There is a stage and they often have live music, and there is a dance floor lit by Christmas lights (there is also two poles on the dance floor).  When I have been, they usually have a band and when they are finished, a DJ comes in (around midnight).  Last time we were there, there was a band playing and two different brides showed up in their gowns dancing with their bridesmaids.  There are fire pits all around, which makes it a great place for cold nights, and there are tables everywhere so it isn't hard to find a seat.  You can play bean bags, and there are also some volleyball courts, but no one seemed to be using them when I have been there (maybe it is more of a daytime thing).  The bartenders are friendly, and everyone seemed to be having a pretty good time.  There have never been any kids at night any of the times I have been, everyone is 21 and over.  The place is huge so it is never crowded.  There aren't many bars in the Happy Valley area, so it is nice to have such a cool place close to us.

How to get there:  
If you are coming from Phoenix and going North, get off on the Jomax exit and pass the light.  It will be the first right after Jomax road, and there is a sign.  If you are coming from north of Jomax, you will need to get off on Jomax, take a left, then another left as if you are going back on the 17, and it will be a right turn."}
{"text":"I use to work here.. and this Manager \"Steve\" is his name, Is the worst restaurant Manager on earth... I worked in the Kitchen. EVERYTHING IS FROZEN!!!!!!!!!! and pre cooked. I got fired for yelling at my staff, for burning a grilled cheese and trying to scrap the burnt toast off and serve it to a guest. If anybody use's this \"Yelp\" thing. PLEASE DON\"T GO HERE!!  they treat everybody like shit..I was a Kitchen Manager. I guess the people who said the food was \"great\" can't taste a thing. They cook the Chicken weeks ahead of time then just put it in a microwave  then \"here you go Sir!\" Gross..They cook nothing from scratch. all pre bought patties, pre bought Dip..Ect. Ect.  if you want to get drunk as hell..Go here, hope you don't mind the sewage leek ;)"}
{"text":"I wrote this review back in back on 1/24/13, but forgot to publish it until now. Looks like it's been closed now for a while. S.C.F. was a cool idea, but I think the rural location, massive size and spread out layout hurt it in the end. Oh well, here's the old review...


This place is far too big and out in the middle of nowhere. It's definitely a different kind of bar. I'd say it's more like a scene out of a 70s or 80s summer camp movie than a regular bar. 

The first time I went there it was virtually empty with no band and no music on a Friday night. The second time I went there a group of senior citizens tried to pick up my buddy and I. For a moment I thought I was on that Betty White show \"Off Their Rockers.\" Third time I went there they had all their fire pits going and I could hardly breathe from all the smoke. Took two washes to get rid of the smell. 

One thing that is a little weird about this place is how far the stage is away from the crowd. It was awkward when the band (who was actually really good) finished a song and not one person clapped. The bartender there works his butt off. He was a pouring machine that kept the line moving at a quick pace."}
{"text":"It's like your back yard, but with a bartender and someone else tending the grill. Skunk Creek Flats (east side frontage road off I-17 just north of Jomax) is a great addition to the N. Phoenix neighborhoods and I'm looking forward to good times to come hanging out there. The food thus far has been adequate, but the real draw is atmosphere and live bands when there going. That said, the cheese burgers are pretty solid. 

Now all they need is to throw some Buffet on every once in a while, and I'd feel like I was in Rocky Point! :)

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Spoke to the General Manager the other day, he told me they are opening another bar called \"Castaways\" right across from SCF. It will be a 21 and over bar, so for all the people who don't like the kiddies running around this will be the place. Not sure when they are opening though,  hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere.  Don't go if you're hungry, the food sucks.  We were the first ones there on a Saturday night at 5pm and it took 45 minutes to get horrible cold food.  Also, since everything is outdoors there is not a non-smoking section so the table next to you might be smokers.  Very unorganized and inexperienced employees although they are all very friendly.  They just need proper training."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure I realy like this place, but for some darn reason I can never remember leaving ??????? geat outdoor bar with tons of room, sand v-ball, horse shoes and live music! one of my new fav places."}
{"text":"I like the idea of having an outdoor bar.  I have yet to experience this place at night, but from what I've seen when driving by, it's HOPPIN'.  

I'm sure that they suffer in the summer time because it's so warm and they don't really have an inside area to sit, but otherwise, it's a gorgeous desert bar.

The service was great... the food was good... the chili... yum.  Get the chili. :)  Oh and the fried corn.  OMG."}
{"text":"We've taken the work crew to SCF several times for happy hour. The management staff has bent over backwards to accommodate our needs and really seems to appreciate our business. They have a great staff providing great service. There are no servers running around taking orders, but this may change as they grow. The menu is very simple (bar type food) but is prepared well and tastes good. A few of us have been here on a Friday night and the atmosphere was great. Anyone that has issues with kids being around before 10pm should probably go somewhere else because there were quite a few kids! 

Good food, an atmosphere that accommodates families (early), service with a smile, and owners and managers that appreciate your business. Seems like a recipe for success."}
{"text":"The food was average. The drinks were VERY watered down. The service was mediocre. The redeeming factor is the atmosphere. I really like the way the seating is mostly outdoor and they have a fire pit where people sit to keep you warm. If I had to review entirely on the service and food, I would have given it a two. +1 for atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out, because it is so close to where I live.  The setting is nice, but the service is terrible!  I can deal with going to get my own beer, but the bartenders behind the counter are not friendly or at least the ones I encountered.  The stench/smell near the restrooms is overwhelming and makes you wonder what might be in the water and several of my friends who did eat the food got sick.  I would say try at your own risk!!

A week or so later we discovered that this place got hit with a food code violation from the City of Phoenix for their deep fryer grease being old and rancid.  I am sure they cleaned it up, but I would never eat there.  I might venture to go there again, but only if I am drinking bottled beverages!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Service is lacking, no one smiles.  Food is ok"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is just north of Jomax/I-17 along the east access road.  Perfect place for after work drinks and (bar) food.  Friday and Saturday they had a band with active dance floor.  Only downside is everything is outside so I suspect it will be very warm in the summer when the sun is up.  After dark with the mister's was fine"}
{"text":"We got chips and salsa, a bowl of chili and beers. The chips, we are pretty sure, were recycled from past orders. We found a rolled up paper straw cover in our chips and the way it was rolled up it must have been wet at one point. 

The chili was not good. It came in a small styrofoam bowl and was not worth the price. Wendy's, sadly, has better chili. 

The only upside is the beautiful AZ weather."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place - HUGE outdoor desert bar.  I haven't tried any of the food yet but the drinks were cheap and served quickly.  There were WAY too many kids running around (after 10:00 PM) so that was kind of a buzz kill, but I'm sure their parents were happy to have somewhere they could go and have fun and still bring the kids.

Just don't blink if you're looking for the entrance from the one-way frontage road just north of Jomax!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome outdoor bar with live music. Prices are moderate, food is alright and beer is bottle only.  Try it out"}
{"text":"The first time husband and I visited Skunk Creek, we were a little intimidated. It was just us two and we did't know anyone who had ever been there. Admittedly, we left after a few minutes. We went again, with another friend to boost our confidence. We decided we really enjoyed the place and have been back a few more times. Live music, decent prices, and good food. Corn nuggets!!! Yum, delicious. We haven't partook in any of the other activities they have (volleyball, horseshoes, cornhole), but it sounded like everyone was having a good time!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to right this review for a new place up north on the east side of i-17 just north of Jomax.  It just opened and it didn't seem like they could handle all of the business on a Saturday night but north Phoenix has needed a place like this so bad that I would be lying if I didn't tell you I love it.  The food is nothing special really but it served its purpose, we ordered chili which was pretty good, chicken fingers the kids loved, quesadilla, chicken wings, and 2 beef tacos all decent.  The fact that I can go there and have a beer with my family while my kids play on a playground and my friends play horseshoes all while a live band is playing and a big grass area for kids to play also makes this place awesome.  There is no waitress service so you have to get in line to order food, and it kind of reminds me of Salty Senoritas over in Arrowhead but without the servers.  The whole place must be on over 5 acres or so, it looks so big and they also do weddings and stuff like that.  I am sure there is much more to tell but I only came here once after our soccer game Friday night and I think it will be a regular stop for us now."}
{"text":"Kind of reminds me of camping.  Cold beer, music, firepits and good food from the grill."}
{"text":"We were there for the first time tonight, and were looking forward to it since my friends live 5 minutes away. 

The atmosphere was good, though the band was due to start 1 1/2 hours later than advertised due to a wedding. We LOVED the bartenders who made sure my friend got as much of the last bottle of chard that was available (but one bottle available on a Friday night???) 

Was not too fond of all of the little kids running around the place post-dinnertime. 

But the killer for us was the wafting sewer stench that came and went the entire time we were there. we originally planned on eating dinner there, but after a couple of drinks, we just could not take it anymore. 

SCF is a diamond in the rough, and we hope that they can work out their issues because we'd love to be able to spend more time there."}
{"text":"Fun place. Monastery meets Greasewood flats is the best description. 
Service is kind of lame, so I grabbed my own drinks numerous times from the bar.
Food was typical, live band was ...eh both times I went.

Still, I would go back for the ambiance."}
{"text":"As many of the other reviews talk about, this place is GIGANTIC.  The property extends way beyond even the usual outdoor area.  There are tons of tables, firepits and a huge dance floor.  So you won't have to worry about bumping into people.  The one time I have been here it was not as crowded as I would have expected for a Friday night however.  This is a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you can easily grab a spot and don't have to fight for a table and bump into people.  However, it felt a little empty with only a handful of people on the dance floor.  I think this is a very cool venue.  The people who worked here were very friendly and effiicent, and that's always a good sign as well.  I love the set up.  The fact that's it's all outdoors allows it to encompass a much larger area than a place like this usually would.  I think people just need to spread the word about this place so that it doesn't seem so empty."}
{"text":"A big group of us came here on a Friday night for happy hour after work.  It was great!  I loved the openness and we could sit without bumping into other people.  There was an area for kids to run around with a playground for them.  It was perfect outside!  (Although I don't think I'd come here during the summer....it must get awfully hot out there.  There's not really anywhere to sit inside)

You have to go inside to order food and I also ordered all my drinks inside.  The bartender was very nice and helped me decide what to drink since I am picky.

I didn't love the food selection because it was mostly greasy bar food and I was in the mood for something lighter.

It kind of had a Monastery/Greasewood Flats vibe to it."}
