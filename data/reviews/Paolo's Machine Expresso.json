{"text":"Quirky.   My Italian style latte was served in a glass cup. It was smooth with a surprising depth to the flavour.   I tried a Portuguese custard tart and that really hit the spot.   Overall, the quality of the coffee and food was good. The atmosphere was ... Yes, quirky; maybe even a bit retro. Well I liked the whole package."}

{"text":"Ordered 2 natas and tea... and it cost me 7$...kinda overpriced... The natas were not really good: the inside was granular instead of being silky, and tasted more like sugar and less egg-y.  The decor is cool though, loved the vintage feel."}
{"text":"Love the vintage trinkets, including the piano. Cappuccino was great! Portuguese sweet treats at the counter."}
{"text":"Delicious food at wonderful prices prepared by hospitable staff. The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Café local indépendant, on y sert des sandwichs ainsi que du café. Les muffins aux dattes sont délicieux. ***Pas de wifi ! Parfait pour lire un livre dans un environnement calme."}
