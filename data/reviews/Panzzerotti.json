{"text":"It's a hidden gem! It's a small clean Italian restaurant located next to the Fabre metro. The menu is not big but the food is delicious. They usually bring free appetizers to the table. We received a beet salad, 3 small slices of homemade pizza, 3 mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and olives. The staff is courteous and polite. I totally recommend it if you're in the neighborhood. It's also a bring your own wine place!"}
{"text":"Truly the best homemade gnocchi I've ever had. So authentic, unique and perfectly made. Loved the panzerotti as well. This is run by a darling family who will take excellent care of you and get to know you personally."}
{"text":"Nous y avons mangé un bon souper. Une salade de fruits de mer généreuse et des gnocchi et un panzzeroto. Un bon repas très abordable. Le service est cordial et rapide. Nous le mettrons sur notre liste."}
{"text":"Excellent petit resto familial. Le service que nous avons eu a été excellent. On nous a offert de bonnes petites entrées italiennes. Les panzzerottis (calzone typique du sud de l'Italie) sont absolument sublimes et vraiment pas chers. La salade du chef au fenouil et orange était très bonne et fraîche en cette journée d'été. La mère à la cuisine et le fils au services furent vraiment gentils et attentifs. Nous y retournerons très souvent!"}
{"text":"Awesome family resto. Simply amazing and cozy atmosphere! Their panzerrotto is a specialty from Bari, best in town !"}
{"text":"I was passing in the Neighbourhood on a Friday night and got a little hungry so I opened my trusty Yelp app for some ideas of what to eat.  Turns out I was parked right in front of this little restaurant...Panzzerotti. 

So I called to get a pickup order (don't judge me, I was feeling lazy). 

As soon as I walked in I was greated by the waiter and the owner with smiles and a very warm welcome. 

They inquired how I had heard of the place and told them about Yelp and a picture on there that looked pretty yummy. 

The owner asked if I've had a Panzzerotti before. To wich I replied \"Only cheap ones at Pizza Pizza\". She looked at me with a big smile and said \"Oh. This is very different. I put my heart and soul in these\". I thought that was very cute and made me smile. Gotta love someone passionate about their cooking. 

Now for the actual review of the restaurant and food. 

The place is really cute and well decorated. Very convivial for groups or family and you may bring your own wine. 

I ordered the Pepperoni and cheese Panzzerotti. The crust is amazing. Light and crunchy, perfection. The cheese was gooey and the pepperoni was high quality although a little bit more would've been better. 

I looooooved and was craving another one soon after. (I should've bought 2 )

So if you live in this area or just passing by. Make sure to drop in and try it. You will not be disappointed. 

And note to the owners....Bravo for such welcoming customer service and the food is AMAZING!"}
