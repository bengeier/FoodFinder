{"text":"No frills, filling, and delicious poke. You really get the bang for your buck here! It seems more like a carry out than a sit in place, and I got mine to go.

I like that the order style involves you filling out a card that you submit. I had a regular rice and greens bowl with salmon and spicy tuna, and up to 7 toppings. They pack your bowl full and there won't be much wiggle room!

Although it didn't appear super appetizing, I was impressed by how fresh the fish was and how flavorful the bowl was overall. I probably should've gone with a small but I was hungry at the time. There was so much avocado in the bowl and every bite was a little different because stirring to make a uniform bowl wasn't super possible. I also appreciated that the salad mix wasn't just a sad iceberg salad. 

If you're looking for a meal on the go, service is fast, and a small is probably more than enough food. This is a great option and I will definitely try and come back to test some more combinations!"}
{"text":"Excellent Poke shop (I prefer it to the new one on State Street).  Large portion sizes, high quality fish, broad selection of ingredients (roe!), and a wide array of sauce choices.  The ordering system is perfect for those who prefer minimal verbal interaction; just mark your selections on the menu, pay, and wait.  Location is also convenient, and a burrito (read: wrap) option is an interesting twist.  Highly recommended for sushi fans."}
{"text":"Taste very good, and cheaper than other poke places in town. The fish and vegetables are very fresh as well."}
{"text":"In the evening, orders are 30% off! So I got a giant bowl with double fish for under $10. I love that you can get up to 7 toppings. I think they put too much rice compared to double fish, it still isn't a lot of fish. But it's tasty and a great deal for a lighter dinner."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Affordable, and huge size! Super friendly staff. I enjoyed this place so much!"}
{"text":"Best poke place in Madison, lots of toppings for a great deal! Much cheaper and better value than the other spots"}
{"text":"Had it today for delivery, generous portions for the money and very fresh. I had the large size, huge portion."}
{"text":"Super good, great flavors, fresh fish. The staff is really nice and helpful as well. The store interior is clean with tables as well as a large area to wait for take it orders. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of Hawaii or LA food truck life"}
{"text":"The way you order is that you fill out a little sheet and they make it for you. I liked that a lot, because I'm a little socially awkward lol. They also give you a lot for the price! They aren't stingy with the extra add ons and the quality is quite good. I actually think *this* might be my favorite poke place in Madison, but they just keep popping up! I definitely think that the value is the best here and the quality is great. The location is good as well. The restaurant looked clean, it was nothing super fancy. I recommend that everyone who isn't sure which one of the newest poke places in Madison to go to, go here!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try! The more options you add the better it taste! I got the salmon w/ ahi tuna for my first bowl. Full of flavor!!"}
{"text":"This place might be hard to find at the moment as there are no signs.  It is in old space that Erbert and Gerbert used to occupy.   I only knew to stop by because I was traveling on foot.  I was glad that I did!

This was my first time trying Poke in Madison and I was pretty impressed given how far we are from the ocean.  The prices are VERY reasonable.  My favorite thing about the place was how many options you are given.  You can pick up to 7 vegetable items and unlimited sauce. 

If you aren't feeling like a bowl you can get a burrito which I'm excited to try on my next visit. 

This place would get a 5 star review, but the ambience is lacking at the moment.  There are no decorations and the signage from Erbert and Gerbert can still be seen on the inside and outside.  Adding some bubble tea or more drink options would bring this place over the top.  The place is bare, but by no means run down or dirty.  Its actually super clean.  Other perks are free wi-fi and they deliever with eatstreet and grubhub. 

The spoke with the owners and they are super nice.  I hope they are here to stay."}
{"text":"Good portions, a pleasant surprise to find in this college town. Fish seemed pretty fresh, the mango topping is something I don't usually see even out in LA.

I ordered the large salad/rice situation, and they do pack on quite a bit of rice--- maybe I just do the salad only variety next round. I tend to lean towards less rice, but maybe that's what you're into?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place in Madison! Great quality and size for the price. Love the salmon with brown rice and spicy aioli and the house soy sauce! You got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Tasty spot for lunch. The kids actually liked it too. Friendly service and excellent tasting ingredients. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Poke It Up by pure luck. It was by far the best we've had in a long time. The poke was light, flavorful, and filling even in the small portion! Customizable bowls are a plus!"}
{"text":"Many people wandering around campus might not aware of this place because it is in old space that Erbert and Gerbert used to occupy.  Never judge a poke place by its facade!

Pro:
- Strategic location in campus
- Hearty portion (up to 7 toppings)
- They pack the bowl until it's really full
- Reasonable price
- Burrito (I call it Sushirito) option

Con:
- Limited sitting space

I have not tried the sushirito, but would probably going to enjoy it more than the bowl. I personally like to mix-in my poke bowl, which can be difficult because they are so generous that they pack my small bowl so full..I cannot even mix it without having bits and pieces falling to the table. Having it to-go would fix this problem, since you will get a lid and can shake the bowl to mix everything together!"}
{"text":"I'll say for what you get here size wise, it's leaps and bounds above Miko Poke. The portion size is huge. I took a picture to show that. 

I got a large with salmon, tuna, and shrimp. Husband got a large with just spicy tuna. He really enjoyed the spice level, I wasn't adventurous today to try it. My salmon and tuna were slightly frozen, but it didn't take anything away from the bowl. My order was slightly wrong, but still good. 

The door is kept open, which means there's no a.c., which makes eating in a little uncomfortable. 

Overall though, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved the service, sweet people. Super affordable for poke and very generous portions!"}
{"text":"Generous portions and delicious tasting, Poke It Up is quite the addition to university area. Take your pick of small, medium or large bowls of 1, 2 or 3 protein toppings and an additional up to 7 toppings, along with your choice of soy sauce and mayo sauce. All the toppings were absolutely delicious! 

Plenty of sushi rice or choice of brown rice and/or with salad fills the bottom of the bowl. Toppings are all neatly arranged on top of the rice and fits snuggly in a clear plastic container. Finding parking around downtown is always tricky but there are plenty of street parking and garage parking nearby."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for some awesome food! I was from out of town and the place definitely lived up to the reviews! Pretty good portions for the price and the Ahi Tuna was fantastic"}
{"text":"This is the best poke place in Madison. The one on state st made me so sad because, coming from California, I have missed poke SO MUCH, and in spite of my expectations being set qquite low, that place was CRAZY over-priced and bad.

This place has great quality, perfect pricing, generous toppings (at no extra cost, because that other sham of a poke restaurant charges extra for SEAWEED SALAD!! IT Is POKE FOR PETES SAKE!!), AND DID I MENTION THIS PLACE HAS A GREAT PRICE FOR A TON OF FOOD!

Do not waste your money with other poke places in Madison, this is the best. Coming from a poke expert.

Also the staff is extremely friendly (especially compared to the young jerks at the place on state st).

Anyways, keep this place in business as they are wonderful and all other poke places around here are bad and should feel bad."}
