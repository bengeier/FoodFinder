{"text":"Must stop in!   I went in there for lunch and grabbed two slices of pizza.  Meat lovers and buffalo chicken.  They were very good.  You can taste the fire roasted style.  Not the best in the world but still phenomenal! The meat lovers is probably my favorite and they do not skimp on the toppings.  You can get regular crust or wheat, I went with regular and I liked it.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches but I've yet to try. Stop by and try it out!"}
{"text":"This might be the best pizza downtown. Wood fired with a delicious crispy crust. You can pick up a slice or two to go, and get whatever toppings you want on them. White pizza, sausage, even chicken were all delicious. Prices are reasonable and the service is always friendly. And it's \"pizza with a purpose\" to boot.  They also have wood-fired breakfast but I haven't had a chance to sample it yet."}
{"text":"Meh! A bit disappointed. A friend of ours had ordered from here during one of the Steeler games. The food had been fresh and good. Hoping for the same we tried it for dinner tonight. The Vodka pizza and wood fired wings left me wanting. The flatbread crust was too hard and the wings were 'icky' dry.  When places like this that have the potential to be good lack consistency it saddens the foodie in me. I'm giving it a 3 keeping my first experience in mind. Not sure if anything in future would compel me to give City Oven another go."}
{"text":"I actually love the City Oven. I go to their breakfast truck parked on Banksville at Sonny and Joes at least 1 - 2 times a week. A bacon sandwich is $3 and sausage is $3.25. It use to be a dollar less, but they raised their prices.   I ate in the restaurant twice, both times being a Saturday afternoon and no one was there. When you walk in you have to walk up a set of stairs where you are greeted with a nice, clean, and simple dining area. You order at a register and then you sit. Each time I sat outside on the side of the building under the yellow awning to look out onto Banksville Rd. The patio is pretty cute with a fire area surrounded by Adirondack chairs, some tables with umbrellas .   The sausage and peppers panini is very good. Not greasy at all and the sausage has a nice spiced taste. They give you the option of whole wheat or white bread, which is great! They also give you an option between frozen grapes or chips as a side, go for the frozen grapes they are tasty.   I also tried a bite of their chicken pesto panini and it was very good, pesto tasted fresh.   Everything is quickly served, but that could be due to being the only customers there.  Try this place out, especially for breakfast you will not be disappointed and most likely begin to crave it every morning while you sit next to the truck in traffic.   TIP: on mornings when traffic is backed up on Banksville  turn right into the lot where the Mintt is(the first right after the Kuhns lot) and keep going through the parking lots until you reach the truck! You won't get a head of traffic, but you certainly won't waste time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast panini van/cart on Banksville Road in the parking lot of Sonny & Jo's.  The panini's are sold out of the City Oven food stall van.  You drive up to the side of the van, order and receive your breakfast panini through the van window, all while staying in your car.  This is a side business for the City Oven restaurant across the street on Banksville Road.  This cart only sells paninis, both sausage and bacon, and they only accept cash.  The sausage, egg, and cheese panini is $3.25 (total with tax), and $3.00 (includes tax) for the bacon, egg and cheese panini.  Additionally, they sell La Prima Coffee.    This is a great way to grab a very tasty breakfast sandwich during the M-F morning hours.  The paninis are a great size, not greasy, and have a good proportion of egg, cheese (& meat).  This cart is not affiliated with Sonny & Jo's whatsoever, but uses their parking lot during the morning hours to allow for super convenient in & out traffic while going northbound down Banksville towards downtown.    Stop and try!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn on City Oven. i always have a good time here, the atmosphere is great, but the food is mediocre.  They wood fire their pizza and it can be really great or it can be really awful. It's very inconsitent. The last time we ate here it almost tasted like they were cooking on a fire that was burning plastic. Our pizza had the chemically taste to the crust. When we complained they made another one but it still had that taste to it. It was disappointing because when the cooks are on they are ON and the pizza is amazing.  The breadsticks are not great. They really have no flavor, just bread sliced into sticks.   Parking is the biggest problem here. They are located on busy Banksville road and have a small lot.  There is a tax service next door where a lot of the overrun tends to go.  They are BYOB which is nice, we always take a bottle or two of wine. Hopefully they work on their consistency when it comes to their pizzas."}
{"text":"City Oven is a nice, smallish venue tucked away Downtown and has just enough patrons during weekday lunch to feel active but not crowded.  The pizzas (whole or by the slice) are pretty darn tasty, but the pesto chicken panini is where it's at."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to learn that the Banksville location has closed.  I was getting set to write a review on my first visit to City Oven:  their red pizza and wings were the best I've had in the area since moving to Mt. Lebanon in July."}
{"text":"I just stopped by this little place for lunch with a co-worker and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! It's small, warm, and homey. I got a lunch special, which was half of a brick oven caprese sandwich and a side salad with drink for $10. Not a bad price for a Pittsburgh lunch. The sandwich was out of this world and the salad had really good blue cheese on it. I will have to start coming back more (my little secret place!)"}
{"text":"I am very happy with City Oven. I have to eat Gluten Free and have tried so far a regular cheese, veggie and buffalo chicken pizza which have all been great. I don't like many GF pizzas but enjoy this one. The wait will be a little longer than usual due to them putting on gloves and making sure its cooked right for you but its worth waiting for because they do what they should. I definitely recommend to stop there!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try.  Pizza was so-so at best.  Price was alright.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Super! Not only is this some of the best pizza you can get, but its \"pizza with a purpose\". The restaurant hires underprivileged kids who would otherwise find it hard to find a job. Read the postings on the dream wall while waiting for your order."}
{"text":"I stop here for breakfast often. They have the best breakfast sandwiches in downtown. The egg and veggie is delicious. Got an egg and cheese w/bacon today and there's a ton of bacon. Only issue is they dont have coffee but I have my coffee on the ride in so a bottle if water is just fine with me. Highly recommend them for breakfast"}
{"text":"City Oven is delicious! The specials are always on point and have never had a bad meal from here. Staff is extremely friendly.  Since the pizza is made out of Flatbread instead of traditional dough, everything is made to order and extremely fast."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza here. I was expecting a lot more considering their tag line is \"fresh fire roasted.\" If the pizza is fire roasted, I couldn't tell. We ordered the sweet sauce pizza, wishfully thinking it might be a nice alternative to my favorite pie from Fiori's. Unfortunately, the City Oven's pizza reminded me of something you'd find in the freezer aisle of the grocery store.  Although I didn't like the pizza, I would be willing to give this place another chance and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown.  I like that I can order the pizza by the slice and get exactly what I want.  I usually order two slices, one meat lovers and one of something else.  They don't skimp on the toppings, and they are delicious! The sweet sauce pizza they offer is really good as well.  Because it is a small place I usually get my order to go, then my coworkers stare at me when I'm back in the office because it smells SO good. The pizza certainly is not cheap, but if you can fill up on 1 or 2 slices, you can get out of there for less than $10, which is pretty normal in town."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! The place is clean and the employees were very friendly! They have great pizza options and you can grab by the slice or get a whole pie!"}
{"text":"Needed a gluten free lunch and didn't want just a salad. They have gluten free pizza and sandwiches. I had the gf buffalo sandwich on a flatbread. Delicious. First time at the City Oven but will return. Hubby had the sliced ribeye flatbread sandwich special. He says it was very good as well."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ and was on a quest to find \"real pizza\" in this 'good pizza desert' called Pittsburgh. This isn't what I wanted, BUT, this is a great product. The price is decent for downtown (don-ton) and ingredients are quite good. This is my fav pizza spot of the nearly 20 I've been to since relocating to Pitt four months ago. Going back today for the pepperoni and mushroom slices. Yum!"}
{"text":"OK place to grab some pizza and wings.  The pizza was good but nothing outstanding.  I did not have any wings but they did not look all that great."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. It was my first time but all of my bosses rave about city oven. I waited in line while looking at a menu. You can order the pizza whole or by the slice. You can also choose the crust which is awesome. I noticed a few people with flat bread sandwiches that looked delicious.   I decided on a margarita pizza. The manager was very kind as well as the employees. The pizza was ready quickly. While it was tasty, I found it to be an average margarita pizza. The sauce could have used some seasonings or flavor. It wasnt a very exciting sauce. Also they either used dried basil or it was just diced up very tiny. Larger pieces of basil would have been appreciated since its one of the main ingredients in a margarita pizza. One good thing is that i only ordered one slice, but it came up as 2 (i guess the slices are just large so they cut them in half)   I'll be sure to try them again.. maybe ordering a buffalo chicken pizza slice or a flat bread sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm really digging their wings and wood-fired pizza. That they deliver to Beechview now is a plus. I definitely recommend City Oven."}
{"text":"Let me just say the pizza here is DELICIOUS. You have to pay for each additional topping so it might add up but it's not too bad pricing. The inside is nice and there's outdoor seating too. It was really loud with like a million kids when I went which was kind of annoying but the pizza's bomb. Definitely check it out!  BTW it's free BYOB cause they don't sell beer anymore. There's a liquor store two doors down though if it's a must."}
{"text":"I agree this is a welcome lunch spot.  Menu is Flatbread pizza (14\" or a slice) of various traditional styles, plus meat lovers, garden veggie and buffalo chicken. That'll set you back $10-15 or $3-4/slice. 8 Flatbread sandwiches from $5-8 with lots of different roasted veggies. Salads and wings.  I had a roasted portobello sandwich. The mushroom was roasted in a balsamic sauce with onions and cheese on the housemade flatbread. The oven fired flatbread was easily the best part, if not just a tad on the bland side (just add salt!)  I'll be back. Two years ago I would have said $8-10 for lunch was expensive but it seems like that is just the going rate in downtown pittsburgh for anything beyond subway."}
{"text":"Mmm... meat lovers!  A lunch buddy raved about this pizza joint and after sponsoring a run I have to say \"sustained!\".  The meat lover's pizza on wheat is really really good.  Everything stands out and works well together.  You can taste the smoke on the meat and all of them have distinctive flavors.  The sauce is just tangy/tomatoey enough and the wheat crust is unusually chewy under the toppings but crispy at the edges (nice work).  The only weak point is the cheese which was there and tasty, but comparatively just holding it's own.  All in all, great pizza.  I'll definitely be having it again."}
{"text":"This place was a really awesome lunch stop for a coworker and I. We ordered a large specialty pizza and it was absolutely phenomenal! I plan on going back to buy individual slices of some of their other pizza, as it all looks great.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I ordered two slices assuming they'd be normal sized, but they were huge and cut each, so it was like 4 slices. Couldn't finish, but enjoyed! Friendly service and quickly made."}
{"text":"I tried to like it here, I really did. We ordered several different kinda of pizza each time, and I must say I've had better. I am pretty picky with my pizza, it's just that there is so much terrible pizza out there, why would I waste my time on some that isn't blow your socks off? It's mediocre at best. Not bad, but not amazing either."}
{"text":"I visited a few times now, I've found not only the food to be terrific but the service to be equally impressive.  It's rare to find a device staff that is so accommodating and responsive.   They have the best gluten free crust I've ever had;  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This was my first Pittsburgh Pizza Week spot. and I was definitely surprised by their pizza week option. It was a brown sugar blueberry bacon ricotta pizza that was actually very very very good. The reason I am giving 3 stars though is because I also tried the plain pizza and for me, I judge a pizza place on their plain pizza. Also because that Pizza Week special was only available during that time. The plain slice just was not good. I am confused by some of the reviews, but everyone has a different taste in Pizza. I've eaten a good deal of pizza in my life and this one just wasn't hitting.    However, if they ever do that pizza week pizza again? I AM SO THERE."}
{"text":"City Oven has great quality food, especially the Oven Fired Sandwiches! I stop in almost twice a week for lunch during my busy work day. Personally love the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and the White Pizza! -- Also, very convenient to stop in for a quick Egg & Cheese sandwich on my way to work!"}
{"text":"Basically flat bread with toppings added. You get a lot for your money. Had white and buffalo chicken. Tasty and quick for a lunch downtown.  Get there early as the line gets long close to noon. I sat at the window and people watched."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite pizza spots in town. The pizza crust is the selling point for me. It's hard to find a good pizza dough that's not too thick, thin, burnt, etc.   My personal favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza. It has just the right amount of sauce to crust ratio.  They don't throw on fried food like a lot of other buffalo chicken pizzas which I really like.   Ambiance: 3 Food/Drink quality: 4 Presentation: 4 Price: 4 Overall: 4"}
{"text":"I decided to try the City Oven today for lunch. What a treat. I noticed most everyone in the place had pizza and it all looked good, but after glancing over the menu I decided on the Sausage and Peppers sandwich. The guy behind the counter who took my order was pleasant enough. He asked if I wanted my sandwich with wheat or white bread (I choose wheat) and if I would rather have a side of chips or a cup of pineapple. I went with the pineapple thinking it would be a nice contrast to spiciness of the sausage and peppers.   He even offered me a cup for water without pressuring me into purchasing a soft drink (who does that anymore).  My sandwich was ready in about 5 minutes.  The bread is tough to describe. It's obviously made in-house and it kind of resembled a toasted flat bread... delicious never the less. It came with a generous topping of sautéed peppers and onions and I was also surprised to see that the sausage wasn't a patty or a link but rather crumbled.  The sandwich was very tasty.   I have mixed emotions on the atmosphere of the City Oven. While it is well lit, very clean, modern yet casual, it was also a bit cramped. I'd say that's about my only negative on the place but it won't deter me from going back. I'd like to try the pizza next time.  Thumbs up for the City Oven."}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch here yesterday with a coworker and really enjoyed it. It was my first time there and I wasn't sure what to expect since the pizza joints in the city aren't that great. It's sort of a grab and go type place but they do have some seating. I had a slice of white pizza and a slice of buffalo chicken. Two completely different flavors but both equally tasty. They make the pizza as your order so it's not sitting under heat lamps all day. I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"City Oven now delivers! Luckily nothing was lost in the short journey from Banksville Road to our home in Beechview. The pie, adorned with black olives, bacon, and minced garlic remained as wood-fired crisp in crust as it had been when we dined there 2 1/2 years ago. The wings were as meaty and well-seasoned as ever.   We were told that City Oven no longer carries gelato, which is probably a good thing (see my previous review)."}
{"text":"Great new fast-casual that is open for breakfast or lunch!   Great addition to downtown for lunch!  Fresh Fire-Roasted Flatbread Pizza, panini sandwiches, soup and salad.   Pizza with a purpose!     Have been to the other location and now to this location.  Delicious Flatbread Pizza, salads, breakfast panini and Wood-fired wings.  You can be creative and create your own pizza or sandwich.  Had the Capocollo flatbread sandwich with lettuce tomato cheese and fire roasted onions and the dry-rubbed wings.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"The patio is great at this time of year.  Our group eat around the fire pit on the patio.  Great place to hang out with cool nights and warm fire.  We all BYOB and it was fun to try different food and wines.    Oh Yeah, BYOB is Back.  Do not serve beer or wine, sold liquor license, so it is BYOB again.  Sampled the bread sticks which are a nice crusty pizza like sticks with garlic, some great white pizza with fire roasted spinach and fire roasted tomatoes.  Also, had a salad which is fresh with some blue cheese and some wonderful balsamic vinaigrette."}
{"text":"Several years ago, I worked in the Grant Building, and I would come to City Oven often to get pizza for lunch. It was always delicious, and I love that wheat crust is an option. Today, I went back for the first time and decided to get a sandwich. I got the Capacollo and it was absolutely delicious. It was so good, and absolutely enormous for the price. It also came with a choice of side, either canteloupe or chips, for $7.50.  I am surprised this place isn't more popular - I will definitely become a regular customer again."}
{"text":"One my list of Must Try Places, so I stopped in for a (very) late lunch.  Turns out, I recognized  the G.M., from his days as an A.M. at Au Bon Pain in EQT building.   Bit into an exceptional, delicious, wood-fired puzza. I haven't had that since leaving  NY.  HUGE, fresh dollops of Ricotta cheese topped the pizza. Not greasy! (Pet peeve: greasy pizza) Had perfect amount of garlic, mozzarella,  etc. Fantastic  crust. I ate every bit.  They have fresh salads ($7.99-9.99),  pizza, whole, or by the sluce,  on white ir wheat crust, and sandwiches. All specialty  sandwiches are  $7.99, and house sandwiches,  $4.99-6.99, all available on white or wheat, or on flatbread.  Breakfast ranges from $1-6.99.  They do catering, too.  City Oven is open M-F, 7am-3pm, a convenient walk from just about everywhere. Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Loved the white pizza!!!! So delicious & so many options... the cheese pizza was a little too saucy for me. They drizzle sauce on top and it kinda washed out the cheese, atleast for me... I ordered 2 \"slices\" but their slices are equivalent to 4 regular slices, so it's definitely a bang for your buck! Nice employees too. They were so respectful.. offered to throw away people's garbage while they were on break, said bye to me and remembered my name! It's a really cute little place tucked away by the post office. Great service, the only reason for 4 stars is because of my personal preference of the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Picked up pizza for team at work. The gang loves the food here. I think it's good. Not horrible not amazing but good. Fire roasted but the flavor isn't always spot on. Flatbread style which is nice when you don't want to fill up on a lot of carbs. Many toppings to choose from. Today was the standard pepperoni."}
