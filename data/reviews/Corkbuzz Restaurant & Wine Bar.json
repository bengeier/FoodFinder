{"text":"Cute little restaurant in South Park. Love their wine selection and the food was definitely very well done. We went in a quiet rainy Sunday evening and The waiters seemed more interested in coaching / training the new ones than real customer service but the experience turned out quite well over all so won't complain."}
{"text":"I would technically give this 2 1/2 stars. The food was good. The service was lacking. We went for Restaurant Week. Our server had her cell phone sticking out of her back pocket which was immediately a red flag. First I ordered a sommelier choice wine flight. After the server poured the wine I noticed some kind of prints on the inside of one of my glasses. I called her over and showed her. She said Oh that must be how someone picked up the glass. What? Isn't that in Waiting 101 Don't pick up glasses from the inside? So she took the glass away and brought a new glass which I'm sure had the same wine in it. Then our bread course came. Then not two minutes later our first appetizer course came. Ugh. She then came over and said I was hoping the way I rang that in would give you more time with the bread. Um did you not learn about firing courses either? I had the smoked pork loin which was good but I could've eaten a whole plate of the braised cremini mushrooms, onion chutney and pickled salad that came on the side. The coconut cake was fine but nothing that I couldn't get at Publix. Overall my experience was just okay but there are much better places to go some even right next door."}
{"text":"From start to finish, Corkbuzz was a disappointment. As mentioned by other reviewers, the bartender was incredibly rude which might be forgivable if his pours weren't so weak and overpriced. 

For food, we ordered the sweetbreads, sea bass, pork shoulder and ham hock tater tots (which contained no traces of ham). Every bite was woefully under salted and forgettable, with the exception of the pork shoulder which was so terrible, we remember it well. I have never been so disappointed by a roast pork dish in the state of North Carolina. I could have done far better in a slow cooker.

It bears repeating because it is so simple, but where was the SALT?!

Expensive and underwhelming aptly describes our whole experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hip wine bar you have found it. Master sommelier always a sure bet!  Food was great, but go for the wine."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to Southpark!  The food is unexpectedly amazing.   The cheese plates are solid - especially the housemase ricotta.  The foie gras with biscuits is probably the best dish I've ever had in Charlotte.  Every dish I've had over two visits was excellent.  I haven't tried any entrees but have instead dined on a variety of small plates.  The staff is friendly, they serve liquor and beer in addition to wine and they take reservations.  Great spot for date night or girls night out."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. And only because if was restaurant week.  The wine choices are awful by the glass and the bartender seemed to be annoyed doing his job.  Not a friendly smile just an arrogance that turned us off. I think it's insane that you only have the silly prefix menu for restaurant week. We saved 3 dollars doing the 3 course menu and the burger was tasteless and the fries over cooked. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and after a round a golf (my index increased, ugh) and wanted a nice dinner and open tabled this place. Omg, Dietrich the greeter and Dara our waitress were both simply the \"best\".  Oh, and did I mention my meal was everything - had the NC trout. Ummmmmmmm. If I come back this way, I'll definitely revisit Corkbuzz."}
{"text":"First time here for a sun brunch. Not crowded, yet food takes a very long time to come out. Had the $35 brunch special. Everything presented well. Appetizer was the banana nut bread French toast. It was good but taste more like a dessert than breakfast. Had the burger for second course. It was good but was missing the bacon mushroom  jam that was supposed to be on it. My dessert was the chocolate cake...wasn't impressed at all. Overall not very impressed with the food but gave it 4 stars because the customer service was good. I suggest just go for the wine; not the food."}
{"text":"Really cute atmosphere and setting.  The place is small but nice.  Loved their brunch.  The lemon ricotta pancakes is to die for.  I also loved their cauliflower and shoe string fries.

My group was disappointed with the service as it was bit slow, but nice wait staff though.  I would still go back.  If the service was on time would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We started off with the goat cheese dumplings and cheddar nduje biscuits which were delicious.  We enjoyed good wine.  

However, the entree left a lot to be desired.  I had the pork (as I was told this was one of the most popular). The pork shoulder lacked clean chunks of meat.  There were Brunswick stew pieces pieced piled up and many of the pork pieces were pieces of fat.  Now, I am fully aware of the shoulder and the expected fat as I smoke these many times per year however at $26/plate I feel the meat could be a little more select.

My wife ate the gnocchi which in her opinion were well overcooked, slightly mushy (big no no in gnocchi land) and really lacked flavor.

The last thing I will comment on is the server, she was on it at first and then fell off.  When we didn't eat 75% of our entree she didn't once ask if they we were ok or how are meals were...

Unfortunately we will not head back to this place even with a great wine menu.  If you're gonna eat there I might recommend sticking to starters, sides, or charcuterie."}
{"text":"Corkbuzz is one of those hidden \"gems.\" Truthfully, having dined in Manhattan a lot, I compare most restaurants with the quality and service I get there. Corkbuzz is close. Service, food, and selection are always good. Ambiance is upscale as well as the prices, but worth it. Clientele are the \"beautiful\" people. Servers are knowledgeable and helpful. Writing this review several months after multiple visits and still appreciate the establishment. Hoping to go back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this new place this weekend and found the food really good.  Its kinda small space but the service was good.  They have a great wine selection.  I'm a Malbec fan so I enjoyed trying a couple of bottles that I had not tried before."}
{"text":"Corkbuzz is very quickly becoming one of my go-to dinner locations in Charlotte. I have been a number of times over the last few months, and the food has not only been consistent, it has been exceptionally well prepared every time. From burgers and chicken to Wagyu steaks, you can't go wrong at Corkbuzz. 

They also have a vast selection of great wines on hand and will even pair each course with a recommended wine.  Overall, the laid back atmosphere, attentive staff, great wine selection, and the amazing food make Corkbuzz a staple in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I went into my visit to Corkbuzz with high expectations and I was not disappointed! Although the restaurant is located a bit far from where I live, a few friends and I made the trip for a pre-Valentine's day dinner celebration on Saturday night. I had made a reservation in advance and we were seated immediately, despite arriving a few minutes late. The ambiance is great...the restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it feels cozy and inviting. It was perfect for a fun girls night out. The one thing that caught me off guard, and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that they were only offering a pre fixed menu, so I wasn't able to sample a bunch of the things I had wanted to try from the normal menu. Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me as I know it was a \"holiday\" weekend with Valentine's day, but I checked the website in advance of my visit and saw no mention of the special menu. 

My friend and I ended up splitting our food, and they were nice enough to separate everything out for us onto separate plates and didn't charge us anything extra. We started with the salad, which was great, but nothing too special. The nuts were a nice addition but there nothing else standout about it. Next, we had the crab cakes, which were excellent. Our main course was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection and was actually quite a large portion, despite the fact my friend and I were splitting! My other friends had the wagyu beef, which also looked great and the portions were surprisingly large. The highlight of the meal was the dessert - and I am not a dessert person, which I think says a lot about how great it was. We had the chocolate cake and the ricotta donuts. The donuts are a MUST TRY! I was hesitant to take a bite at first, but once I did, I couldn't stop. They were served warm and there were more than enough to share with our whole table. Amazing! Our server even gave us each a complimentary taste of a dessert wine to go with our treats (it was a much larger pour than just a sip, but not quite a whole glass).

Overally, I had a great experience, just was a bit disappointed about not being able to try more things on the menu. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding dinner at Corkbuzz last Monday night. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and has a wonderful ambience. As soon as we were seated, our server, Julia, explained that on Monday nights if you purchase a bottle wine, Corkbuzz sends you home with an additional free bottle of the wine that you purchased. What a wonderful idea!  

We shared the goat cheese dumplings which were light and flavorful. I selected the Corvina Sea Bass for my entree while my companions had the Bourguignon Burger and the Local Lettuce Salad and Short Rib Beef Tartare.  One entree was better than the next,  and we each enjoyed our selections very much. The food was creative and absolutely delicious. Every bite was a treat.

We finished our dinner with a fabulous dessert, Ricotta Doughnuts. Our server, Julia, treated us as if we were guests in her own home. She made us feel very welcomed and assisted us in making wonderful selections. I dine out a lot,  and the food and service at Corkbuzz is absolutely excellent. This is a great restaurant, and I'm sure that I will be back many, many times in the future!"}
{"text":"This restaurant truly had everything from surf to turf and an extensive wine list to boast.  Restaurant was intimate yet not feeling crowded. It is my understanding there are only three restaurants. The staff was very friendly and assisted me in choosing my wines. The four of us ordered different entrées and decided to share with each other.  We started out with a burgundy red for around $65. Followed by three appetizers which were on the lighter side. The cheese dumplings were small but tasty and the beets were also shaved thin but delicious. Each of us had a different entrée the Seabass the pork the gnocchi and the sirloin entrées.  I asked the staff to help select the second bottle of red which we preferred to be a little bolder than the first so we ended with a nice Bordeaux red wine for another $65.  We saved enough room for dessert of course and ordered three different desserts the fudge trio the waffles with chocolate and peanut butter and my favorite doughnut balls with a ricotta dipping sauce. The coffees were delicious as well as the Drambuie cordial I ordered.  Entire bill for the four of us was $335 which included two bottles of wine. It's only been open about a year and a half and although it was my first time I'm most excited to return again."}
{"text":"I recently had a very nice dinner at Corkbuzz.  I had made a reservation for us for 8:45, the table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine.  I think we were seated at the table around 9, which would have annoyed me if there weren't two seats left at the bar.

Things got better after we sat down.  We decided to try the pork belly flat bread, it was good, not exactly what we expected though.  It was more like simple pork belly nachos I'd say than flatbread.  Small pieces of pork belly on fried pieces of dough with some baby spinach and dressing on top.  It was good, but not \"flatbread\".  I had the tuna and she ordered the fried chicken.  Luckily the two tables next to us got their food before we ordered so we could see what some of the dishes looked like.  The tuna was delicious, and a large portion.  It came with a corn and zucchini tart and blistered shishito peppers.  I didn't try any of the chicken but I'm told it was very good (my friend, as well as the ladies next to us raved about it).  

The service was mostly very good.  Like I said, a little annoying having to wait to be seated for a reservation, not the end of the world though.  Our server was personable and attentive and I gotta give him credit for handling the shenanigans at the tables around us without getting flustered (they were clearly enjoying themselves, and their drinks).  

That leads us to the dining room décor and atmosphere.  It's a very pretty place, chic and modern décor.  It's not very big though, so I'm sure they get booked up fast for busier times.  I was surprised that it was so loud too.  Corkbuzz would be a good place for a date or girls night out."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Southpark area. It is in the complex right behind Whole Foods. Valet Parking. Great service. 

Artichoke tart was lovely but we would have preferred more artichokes vs puff pastry. Great salad with strawberries - beautiful unexpected presentation on a long plate. We split the chicken entree and it was cooked perfectly and flavorful. The few gnocchi as garnish were a nice accompaniment. 

We will be back again to try out other menu offerings. The roasted cauliflower app and octopus app were both tempting but we didn't want to wind up with too much food."}
{"text":"Pros and cons for the first trip--
Pros: the beef burger was outstanding!! It was definitely one of the juiciest flavors and good matchstick fries. 
The wine selection is varied and the waiter was helpful to guide our choices based on our favorite types of wine.  A bit on the higher end, $13 burger & 10-15 for wine, but you're in South Park so that's expected. 

Cons---
 So So loud! It reminded me of Grand Central or the airport because it was echoing, too loud!! Yes I've lived in NYC so I'm used to loud places, big crowds but this was over the top. You couldn't really have a conversation or relaxing time. I wonder why they haven't used some acoustic tiles to lessen the racket.

They seemed understaffed for the big crowd, so everything took a long time. They might be better in a few months when they get all the new hiccups out of the way. 
I'd give it another go but I can think of other wine bars that are a bit better for a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"I came for brunch with my girlfriends and while the food was good, our experience was less than desirable, to say the least. I reached out and let them know what our experience was like and they invited us back and more than made up for it. Any restaurant that puts effort into service recovery is definitely a place I want to frequent. The brunch is really fantastic!!! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with Corkbuzz, as a whole. You'd think about coming here just for wine, but they have a very delicious menu as well. I was very impressed with how out of the box some of their choices were. The food options are well thought out and they do a great job of helping match wines to pair with your food. 

You should also know that they do regular wine tasting classes, wine 101, champagne 101, wines from different regions (France, Australia) and much more.  They can even source a wine for you. For example, if you are celebrating a memory from Tuscany, they can source a Tuscan wine to try to reciprocate what you are celebrating. They also have great private rooms for events. I came in with the Charlotte Food Bloggers group and it was absolutely perfect for a group and having private and individualized attention. 

We started with scallop noodles, which were amazing! They were served with apple, mint, jalapeno and lemon seasoning, and the flavors were perfect together. We next tried the veal tartare, a different twist on the typical tartare. It was servied with fermented cabbage, turnips and a quail egg, with a side of cheddar chips. The tartare was so flavorful, and I love the bitterness that the fermented cabbage added. The cheddar chips were unbelievable - thin and delicate, while full of flavor. AND YES TO THE CHEDDAR. They were so addictive.

One of my favorite dishes was the confit pork belly, which is served with pork tenderloin, roasted broccoli and gnocci. The combination of pork belly with pork tenderloin gave a unique contrast and the two cuts of pork almost tasted like two different meats. The gnocci was some of the best I've ever tasted. It was so chewy, cheesy and flavorful. I could eat it by the bowlful every day. 

We also tried a unique twist on dessert - a avonlea cloth bound piece of cheddar cheese, served with blueberries, strawberry jam and rosemary toast. I'm usually a cake or ice cream girl - I like really sweet - but this dessert won me over for its more savory side. The rosemary toast was out of this world. It just went perfectly well with the cheese. I would even order this as an appetizer. 

Very impressed with Corkbuzz's creative use of ingredients and flavors, and they have a very knowledeable team. I believe they have 2 or 3 sommeliers, including one of only 33 female sommeliers in the world. You'll find what you're looking for and more here, it's definitely MUCH MORE than just a place for happy hour wine and cheese. Check out their food menus next time you are in and you will agree"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I love corkbuzz for so many reasons. First and foremost the staff. Everyone is on point. So friendly and attentive. Dave is a master at crafted cocktails. Pat and Austin have both taken very good care of us. Best selection of wine and cocktails in Charlotte! They actual offer wine flights. My favorite drink is the figitout. Their chef is working some magic too. Hands down best scallops I've ever had. I wish it was on their regular menu. The pork tenderloin is also delicious. The desserts are my favorite of course. I finally made it out for brunch and they did not dissapoint. Do yourself a favor and get the grits! They also have banana bread french toast. They have outdoor seating but I like to sit at the bar and watch the magic."}
{"text":"Come here for the ambience and wine and decent service but many of their menu items for dinner were a bit pricey and could have been better prepared.

Pros: 
Ambience, location
Scallops (perfectly done with great seasoning)
Wine selection (of course) 
Service was somewhat above average

Cons: 
Braised short rib (tender but not flavorful, and meat quality could have been better)
Ricotta dessert donuts (flavorless dipping sauce)
A bit pricey for what you're getting compared to other nearby options"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night @6:15. While the dining room was empty, we were told that they had no room for us by the hostess. She was a young, inexperienced hostess... She continued to try and explain that her computer tablet would not allow us to sit in the dining room because it would remove other reservations. So much for technology.
 (I had asked for the manager, but the hostess was reluctant to get him). After getting back home, I called and asked to speak to the manager. He came to the phone and said that he had his rear dining room available and we could come back. I don't think so.
The restaurant has lost a customer. This was not worth the inexperienced hostess hired in this supposedly NY establishment. Maybe this is how NY City treats their customers but this will not be acceptable to the Charlotte market.
If you want to go, MAKE A RESERVATION! To be clear, I did not eat or drink here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the whole lunch experience. Very very snobby wait and bar staff.
Food was very  bland, took 20 minutes to finally get a glass of wine, that was not way overpriced.  Will never return. Back to the wine bar at the Ritz, much better value."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Saturday night date!  I took my fiance here for his birthday and it happened to be during Queen's Feast.  Neither of us had been before, so we didn't know what to expect.  Our server, Andrew, was exceptional.  He had great suggestions across the board and was very knowledgeable and comfortable talking about our wine and scotch selections.
We started with goat cheese dumplings with a \"spicy\" shrimp sauce (not even a hint of spice, which suites me just fine, but probably shouldn't be in the description) and salmon flatbread with a dill and chive cream cheese spread and fried capers.  Both of these starters were outrageous.  So delicious!
We were a little less enthusiastic about our entrees.  I had the Sea Bass.  One piece was very dry, but the other was perfect.  Well seasoned with a nice crispy sear.  It was described as coming with pickled cabbage and beans, which didn't end up as I expected.  It was more of a bean dish with two small pieces of sea bass and a tiny bit of cabbage that I probably wouldn't have noticed had it not been in the description.
My fiance got the pork shoulder.  The horseradish in the sauce was OVERWHELMING! Far too much horseradish.  The pork shoulder should have been flavorful enough without drowning it in the sauce.  We will never know.  The sides were delicious (Brussel sprouts and cheesy potatoes). 
For dessert we had a peanut butter pie and apple cobbler with a stout ice cream.  Both were amazing, but by this point, we were so full we couldn't come close to finishing.

The atmosphere was perfect and the service was impeccable.  It would have been 5 stars if the entrees had hit the mark.  I will absolutely come out again for wine and small plates with my girlfriends!  Looking forward to giving it another try!"}
{"text":"This place is still working out the kinks. Made a reservation and was seated right away. Cool hip and loud crowd...stage was set for a fun evening. Started with wine and apps. A few minutes later, the charcuterie and two nice glasses showed up, but our other selection was curiously missing. I really like the wine list here and I was impressed with the place. Unfortunately, from there, it dropped off a cliff. We placed entree orders and then waited...and waited. After 45 min, we got an apology and some bread, along with a promise that our order was coming right up. Then we saw our order go right by us to another table.  Soon after our surprised server went to the back and came back with another apology and more charcuterie. It was another 30 minutes before we got our food, but by then our babysitting time was up. We barely ate, lightened our wallets by $100 and left with another apology and a certificate for a free glass of wine. The entire meal should have been comped. I think this place could be decent with better management (no excuse since they have multiple locations), but we were highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Beware of your expectations as you go to Corkbuzz.

I went into my evening at Corkbuzz as every red-blooded American husband would...

Begrudgingly appeasing my wife to try something new on our weekly date night out. 

She had heard all of these rave reviews from Corkbuzz. I can't tell you the number of times I heard \"honey, did you know that all of the other locations are in Manhattan?\". \"It's supposed to be really good and their wine selection is regarded very highly!\" I heard. 

All I heard through this was, \"wait until you SEE how big this bill is going to be!\" And my personal favorite, \"it's a wine bar, the portions are SUPPOSED to be small.\"

So - my wife sweetly made a reservation for this past Friday and we headed off to a date that I KNEW I would need to make a stop at McDonald's on the way home for a quarter pounder to fill the void in my stomach.

Well - all of those expectations and misconceptions were blasted away at the end of the evening. The wine was great (I'm not a big wino, so I got a flight to try a few out... personally I love Scotch and their Scotch selection is solid.) Then, we did the cheese and charcuterie plate, which every thing on it was incredible. Then, then came the Queens feast. I made the mistake of requiring my wife to get the charcuterie plate because I didn't think the meal was filling. I was BEYOND wrong.

I got the beet salad, because my Midwestern grandmother would roll in her grave if I didn't (rest her soul) and it was great, but my wife's Brussels Sprouts appetizer stole the show. Seriously delicious veggies. 

On to the main course, I got the burger (which I expected to be a \"wine bite slider\" , wrong there) and my wife got the chicken. OK - I always make fun of my wife for getting the chicken, but the chicken was moist, well srasoned, and all around delicious.

Finally - desserts. The apple cobbler, awesome. The ricotta donuts, light fluffy and molten. All delicious.

Overall - our experience there was great and I'd highly recommend a dinner at Corkbuzz. It blew all of my misconceptions away and the food was great. Our service was also nothing but impeccable. Our server, Austin, knew the regular menu and the wine menu back and forth and was more than just a food delivery service, he really enhanced the experience."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Corkbuzz and we were not disappointed!! Having never been here before, we ordered several items to share.  We started with the Seasonal Tart, and let me tell you -- I WON'T be sharing that next time!  It was outstanding!! The Brussels Sprouts with marcona almonds and cheese curds were also well prepared and tasty.  We also enjoyed the flatbread and tried the Bourguinon Burger -- both delicious.  The standout was that tart though . . . . I'm already trying to plan my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has a partner location in Chesley Marketing, NYC - I had heard a lot about it, so I met friends here for drinks and dinner. We tried the little retail shop first and had a glass of wine and some cheese/charcuterie - it was pretty good. 

Then we moved to the main restaurant and they gave us a cute little table by the window. The service was slow, but the wine was good and most of the tapas we ordered were good. I really liked the little honey drizzled bread and the cauliflower. 

The server made some recommendations about the wines that were insightful, that was refreshing.

Overall it was a solid experience and they were pretty cool about arranging the table for our group when one person didn't show up etc."}
{"text":"Came here for a bridal shower! Super cute place with tons of specials. There was a free wine tasting going on from 12 to 2 on Sunday! 

The food was delicious! Must try the Brussel Sprouts and the burger! They also have an amazing peanut butter pie."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, food is wonderful but best is service. My friends had my birthday party here and I felt so special. Thank you all for a great evening. Your hospitality is bar none."}
{"text":"So it's restaurant week. And I'm super hype about going. Never been and by looking at the menu a week ago. I knew what I wanted to order.. Greeted by Stacy. I asked for help on picking a rose bubbles. She gladly to help.. The Rose was ok.. But she did mention it's not as sweet.. Knowing I would like it to be a little sweeter, I went with it anyway. Duhhh, no wonder it's was ok for me.. 
While waiting for my sister to arrive. I order their biscuit with a hint of honey. I love anything with honey.. So this is perfect.. The biscuit was yummy.. Somewhat heavy like a biscuit but have the hint of honey but not dry!! The butter was great.. 1st course was the pork belly with the grilled corn salad. Omg, this I love.. The outer shell was crispy and interior was soft and somewhat creamy.. And with the grilled corn. It pulled everything together! 2nd course: crab linguine. It's on the spicy side of me.. And I don't care for spicy.. Everybody else said not.. But still very yummy.. I'm humming the whole time under my breathe. Then the surprise of the night.z their awesome Graham Cracker Creme Brûlée. All it does was it finish my perfect night!"}
{"text":"We came back for a drink and a snack this afternoon.  This time, the service was fantastic.  The bartender could not have been better.  He was super friendly and he gave us really helpful suggestions.  The rose we had was great.  The gouges are to die for.  For us, food is always more important than service but it's nice to see that the service has gotten better over the last month.  We will definitely be back for dinner again soon."}
{"text":"We stopped here for wine and appetizers and had a blast. Cute atmosphere great wine and food. We had the mixed board and Brussels sprouts. A little pricey, but the experience was great. The staff are also great we enjoyed chatting with them."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed!  I arrived for my 7:15 reservation on time, and grabbed a table outside. The waiter did not come over until 7:45!  We sat for 30 minutes watching him wait on everyone else, ignoring us; I thought we were invisible. He kept looking at us, but never said a word. Finally, he came over...\"so what will you have to drink\" was his greeting. Not, \"welcome to Corkbuzz\", not \"sorry for the long wait\", nothing.  We ordered wine and 2 appetizers.  Took awhile for the wine to be served and it was a very skimpy pour.  After a long wait, one appetizer finally came out.  It wasn't until almost 20 minutes later that our second appetizer was delivered, and the server tried to give it to another table!  I literally grabbed her arm to get my food! 
The food was good, but we couldn't get past the poor service and lousy attitudes. We asked for our check and went elsewhere for the rest of our dinner.  
I expected more from this establishment. I realize this place is new and has some kinks to work out, but a simple \"sorry for the wait\" and a friendlier attitude would have gone a long way. 
I wish you guys all the best, hope your service improves."}
{"text":"went during restaurant week w a group.  the sauce on my pork belly & the corn were the best parts.  they could've saved the pork belly it was so dry.  had the rockfish special again the sauce & garnish were great.  the fish lacked flavor.  the graham cracker creme brûlée where was the graham cracker the sprinkling on top of the strawberries?"}
{"text":"I try to be as fair and objective as possible when I write a review. Let's start with the good:  The ambience is excellent. The service is top notch. The selection of wines, outstanding. 
Now let's move onto the areas of opportunity. The menu prices are quite high, and that's OK with me, if the food is stellar. Unfortunately, that is just not the case. My appetizer was the goat cheese dumplings, and I must say, they were quite delicious, though the portion was very small. (6 small bite-sized dumplings for $9) My dinner however was a burger, I can't remember the exact menu name, I believe the plate ran $15. I found the texture and quality of the meat patty to be subpar. The burger lacked flavor in my opinion. The fries were very pliable and greasy, versus crisp and fresh tasting. I honestly did not report my concerns about the food, when asked about my meal. That would be my mistake. However, I opted not to for whatever reason. It was probably because the server was so outstanding, I did not want to offend. Overall, save your money, if you want a high-quality meal. However, if you are going there for drinks and an exceptional ambience, this is your place."}
{"text":"Incredible bar experience quiet, attentive bartenders going the extra mile with a great ambiance. Will definitely stop by and the best wine bar of the South Park area"}
{"text":"Restaurant week review: wonderful food and service. I've been wanting to try Corkbuzz since they opened, having read about their story and of course the food. The restaurant was surprisingly much smaller than I anticipated, definitely make a reservation if you're planning to go on a busy night or weekend. We were treated to a glass of prosecco after mentioning being recently married, a really thoughtful treat. We started with the pork belly and corn dip appetizers. The texture and flavor of the pork was excellent, my husband really enjoyed it. The corn dip was good but not great, or lacked some depth of flavor and the pita-like chips were neither soft nor crispy, which didn't bother me but I can imagine some might dislike. We split a bottle of Spanish red wine that was less than $30 and excellent. For our entrees we had the crab linguini with chorizo and olives,
and the rockfish with pickled vegetables and grits. We typically share some of our meals with one another and ended up swapping dishes because we each preferred what the other ordered! The pasta was a good mix of flavors and textures, though a bit salty. For dessert we enjoyed the bourbon chocolate cake and the ricotta donuts, both good. The donuts were hot and fresh!  

One of my favorite part of this meal was the excellent service and appropriate pace of the courses. Sometimes restaurant week meals feel rushed even though they are a splurge for many people. we were comfortably able to take our time eating, drinking wine and enjoying one another's company. We look forward to trying the regular menu, as well as brunch."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Corkbuzz last night!  It was my second time there in two weeks.  First of all, the service was amazing!  My friend jokingly told our server we wanted to move in because it was so comfortable there.  Patrick was our server, but Cory, one of the sommeliers, helped us with some great wine and food choices (and told us a few jokes too).  He spent at least 20 minutes chatting with us throughout the night about wines.  He was fun, personable and made our night :-) Patrick was great too.  All in all, I love this place and will definitely be going back.  Oh, and the food was GREAT.  We had the warm olives (yum), crab cake, watermelon and feta salad (amazing) and the burger (wow).  I don't even eat beef...but ate that burger because it was just that good."}
{"text":"The interior of the place is fantastic and the wine list is as well.  The list is much better than The Wooden Vine, in my opinion, which supposedly has the best wine list in Charlotte.

There are, however, a few kinks which they must work out - which is completely understandable.  

First, I'll start with everyone's first impression of the place - the hostess (who would be FIRED if I was the manager).  She did not welcome us and barely said hello.  I actually had to ask her if we could have a table.  She said, 'Yeah just sit.'  She did not offer us a menu or wine list.  The place was not busy, yet we sat for a few minutes (as in perhaps 5 minutes) before someone greeted us by asking whether we were offered the wine list.  I said no and THEN the hostess brought them over.  FIRED.  We were told that we could still order dessert or cheese, but when I asked my server 5 minutes later if we could order dessert, we were told no.  No big deal.  It was late.  I get it.

From the time we were seated to the time we actually got our bottle of wine, it was about 25 minutes, which was kind of ridiculous because it was very late and business was slow.  The manager or sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we ordered and was able to converse with my guest who is an international wine researcher and winemaker, which was a plus.

Our server was nice, but she seemed very nervous and not confident with the wine.

Last bitchy comment I have is that they were playing 80s music - Janet Jackson, etc., which seemed extremely weird and unfitting for the environment.  

I will absolutely be back as I feel this place is a real jewel minus the kinks.  I want to try the food and will definitely be back for the wine.  PS  Fire the hostess!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and better service. Truly a great experience start to finish!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect California wine bistro located in Charlotte. Step inside and you are transported to a new eclectic warm and friendly atmosphere of downtown Napa. The food is fresh light and full of flavor.  While the wine selection is impressive for a place this small."}
{"text":"Corkbuzz is a special place with wonderful food, talented staff, and a pleasant (although kind of strip-mall-ish) atmosphere. The pork was particularly good. The wine pairings are stellar. Desserts were hit-and-miss, with one excellent cake and one pretty unfortunate smoked banana pot de creme. Still, overall it was a lovely night."}
{"text":"You MUST try this place if you are a wine lover.  The staff is incredibly(like blow your mind awesome) knowledgeable.  The food pairings are with the wine are worth a date night.  I haven't tried brunch yet but plan too very soon.  This is a must date night"}
{"text":"The food was great and portioned well but we did not think it was worth the prices. Spectacular wine selection but be prepared to spend a lot!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Tuesday night during their \"Charlotte Wine and Tapas Week.\" The deal was- you get two tapas and two glasses of wine for $35. The restaurant was full, but not incredibly busy. We waited a while for any one to come by to take out order. Once the server arrived, the waiter did not write down the order. Failing to remember the order, he brought me out the wrong glass of wine. We kindly asked that we receive the correct glass of wine. That was no problem, I got the glass of wine I ordered and then got to keep the other. Being that the server did not write down the order, one of our tapas was also wrong (we had ordered Brussel Sprouts, but instead we received the Black Pepper Biscuits). My boyfriend and I overlooked this as the biscuits were delicious. We received the check, and everything was correct. The server took an extraordinary amount of time to retrieve the check and run the card. So much though, that his colleague came over, retrieved the check and ran our card. Once receiving the receipt to sign, we realize the bill had just jumped up by $20. The server must have closed out another table and charged us for their meals/ drinks. We quickly let the server know. She cancelled the transaction and ran the card for the correct amount. Now, we are sitting with a $100 hold on our account in addition to the cost of our meal/ drinks because of one of the many errors made at this place."}
{"text":"Overall this was a great experience during Restaurant Week. Some of our party was running a bit behind and I felt bad for the server. I know they like to keep things moving especially on a night during restaurant week. They have a very large wine selection although I felt not enough mid-priced bottles compared to the number of higher priced ones. And when I say mid-priced I mean $80-120.  I really think a wine bar should have a thorough cross section. They also had a list \"designated\" for Restaurant Week. I did have a nice glass of the Cuvaison Chardonnay which isn't as oaky as most Chardonnay wines.  Now to the food, my selections were the seared  butternut squash crêpe, corvina Seabass, and the ricotta donuts. All three dishes were outstanding, particularly the Seabass. The service was great as well. She visited the table often to make sure we had what we needed. Overall, a nice dinner in a restaurant I had not been to before."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing wine selection with knowledgeable and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try Corkbuzz during a friends and family event - what a fun experience!

The decor and vibe inside is sophisticated, yet warm. Lots of seating options, including small tables and a private room. There is a 2000 bottle wine room that will look tremendous when fully stocked!

Service was gracious and knowledgable - our service person made great food suggestions, the manager chatted with us about pairings and we even had a chance to speak with Laura, the owner! Everyone was attentive, even though it was busy.

Food-wise, we had a couple of the starters - warm olives, and house made ricotta, along with the chicken-fried rabbit. All three were solid, but the ricotta is addictive! The chicken-fried rabbit was an unusual twist on a southern dish, and the warm gravy will be great when it's cooler outside!

The wine selection looks tremendous and paired with the food and attentive service I suspect Corkbuzz will be a hotspot in South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  The bar selection was poor and the staff rushed us the entire meal and were fairly pretentious."}
{"text":"Great brunch! $5 brunch special drinks, mimosa, bloody Mary, etc. Awesome cheddar grits. Try the soft cooked eggs with pork belly, black beans and brussel sprouts. Different and delicious. We had the place to ourself, a rare treat in the Southpark area."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday evening and had our pick of seating on the patio.  Super extensive wine list (almost overwhelming if you're not a wino - which I'm not).  We ordered a pinot from New Zealand, which they were out of but offered a comparable bottle (St. Clair Pinot Noir '13) and it was amazing.  We ordered the gala apple salad, roasted cauliflower (could eat 5 of those plates), cheddar and nduja biscuits and espresso cake.  Service was great, atmosphere was perfect - not somewhere you'll get out cheap but a great place to enjoy light food and a huge selection of wine."}
{"text":"atmosphere is nice, service is good and the servers are very polite. Wine collection is amazing. They have American, Italian, and Spanish wine and their food is delicious. Just let you know that their entrée meal is limited. You may want to look at their menu."}
{"text":"Stop! Do not go here. So not what the Queen City is all about. Wait staff with an attitude! We left the delightful wait staff of the Rusty Bucket in a great mood. Expecting to experience more of new and different in our marvelous city we popped in to Corkbuzz.  WOW,  Corkbuzz is\"BuzzBuster\". We ordered a \"house Cab\" and were indigently told no \"house\" and thrown a menu to select something before ordering. Dutifully looked at menu, ordered a Sambuco and informed Corkbuzz was out of that menu item. 

Not sure why this place is so pretentious? Last I checked this is just \"Charlotte, NC\".Most people still think of this place as \" Carolina \", so why the attitude?

Southpark had so many great places.Try the bar The Palm for a delightful experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Charlotte. They easily compare to high end New York restaurants. I've come here on several occasions bringing my spouse, family and friends. I would HIGHLY recommend it. I have had their burger, many items on the brunch menu and have eaten here twice for restaurant week. You will not be disappointed. The spinach crepe was outrageous! I am by no means a spinach fan but I wanted to try something different as an appetizer, well holy cow, it was incredible. Far bigger than an appetizer portion (definitely could share). We've also enjoyed their ricotta doughnuts which were just delightful, a light crisp dough with different dips, coated in sugar - man, you can't go wrong. I am looking forward to going back tomorrow night. I promise Corkbuzz will have you bragging to your friends and looking forward to your next reservation!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here shortly after they opened. Overall, I had very positive experience. Service was excellent and the food was also wonderful- better than I expected. This place is small and loud, but the service and food/wine makes it a worthy destination."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer of the two Corkbuzz in NYC. I was eager to see if the Charlotte location was just as exceptional, it absolutely was! Outstanding and creative food, paired with great wines that are modern and diverse. And just as I expected their staff provides flawless and knowledgeable service."}
{"text":"The guy bartender we forget his name is awesome. Very knowledgeable about his scotches and took his time with us.  Night manager thanked us for coming in,  donuts were awesome.  Must stop by for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Good food but prepare for a long wait. It took forever for the food to come and when it came, it wasn't right. Had to send it back. The servers were in slow motion. Also, don't order wine here. Worst pour ever ... looked like 1/2 a glass- at best! They need to work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful anniversary dinner with my wife.  We split a bunch of very tasty plates and enjoyed lovely flights as recommended by our knowledgeable and attentive server.  A bit expensive for everyday dinner, but great for a special occasion splurge."}
{"text":"Friends and fellow Yelpers have written mixed reviews and expressed mixed feeling about Corkbuzz. Most of the negative feedback has been about the cost and not the food - the food has gotten great reviews. For the most part, unless some place just gets multiple terrible reviews I like to check things out and judge for myself.

My first impression walking in was \"Wow! This place is beautiful!\" It's got a nice fresh feel to it. Clean lines. For some reason it felt very \"LA\" or \"NYC\" - a \"big city\" atmosphere. Not the typical décor in these here parts. A sparkling wall of glasses behind the bar that makes a grand statement. Another nice feature is the long banquette.

Our server was friendly, chatty and knew a lot about both beer and wine. I like a knowledgeable server - it makes for both good conversation and good drink selections.

My bud Tonya and I met here for a drink so I could \"see for myself\". A round of drinks, one of them a beer, was $20. Part of it is that you are paying for location and atmosphere. The beer and wine list, as it should be in a place like this, was extensive and well selected.

The menu looks pretty orgasmic - the descriptions will make you hungry - you had me at cauliflower (which was the first item). Yes, prices are on high side but someone has to fill that niche in Charlotte. Looks like you could easily spend $50-$75 per person for dinner, appetizers and drinks.

Now for my overall impression - cool, upscale place to bring a date or to come for a special occasion. Saving up my do-re-mi so I can go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Corkbuzz certainly lived up to my expectations!!!  The restaurant has a small super chic vibe, The ambiance was perfect for a date night. The wine pairings we're spot on and we even got to meet Laura the owner ( who couldn't have been more wonderful) I had the octopus appetizer, which was unbelievable. And the clam spaghetti, I have no words. For dessert we had the homemade chocolate chip cookie sandwich and it was as good as it sounds! It was delicious and the best meal I have had in Charlotte by far! Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"We went here for a business dinner last night & it was amazing! John was so knowledgeable about everything we asked and showed us some amazing wines! He was very attentive and was on top of everything. Jacob had the best energy and was so happy. His explanation of everything on the charcuterie board was perfect and he was smiling every time he came to the table! Irene was so sweet and answered every question we had knowing every detail about the menu items we were asking about. 

The food was amazing & I appreciated that we weren't overloaded with too many options! I would definitely recommend trying out Corkbuzz and will be back!"}
{"text":"If this ambiance if your cup of tea, go to J SAMs in Piedmont Row Drive. Food here is decent, service is average & it's very overpriced. Decent place yes, but there's just so many better options in South Park."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Everything was spot on. Nicely season dishes and well composed. Great service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food, wine and service. Patrick is wonderful. DJR"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. Great place to spend time with family and friends. The staff couldn't be nicer"}
{"text":"Just completed my second wine class here and I must say I am very impressed. The classes are extremely informative and well worth a 2-hour break from your busy life, if you have any interest in wine!

The selections of the 6 wines they choose for their tastings are fantastic and expose you to a wide variety of the wine class you are attending!

After the classes, I found myself investigating the wine listings at the bar and have been very impressed with their selection!!  Additionally, the food from appetizers to the main dishes have been great!!

I highly recommend and applaud Corkbuzz for everything they are doing to advance the love of wine and food!!!"}
{"text":"This trendy new SouthPark wine bar and restaurant is absolutely one of the coolest spots in Charlotte to meet friends for a drink -- or a few. The main attraction is, of course, the ridiculously extensive wine list, and on that point Corkbuzz definitely doesn't disappoint. Our server recommended an outstanding Pinot Noir that he promised would be the perfect complement to our meal -- in truth, it was more like the highlight. As fabulous as the wine and setting were, the food was just not quite everything I had been hoping for.

Our Roasted Cauliflower appetizer was tasty, but the Parmesan Gnocchi I ordered for my main course was actually a little bland. At our waiter's recommendation, my wife ordered the Bourguignon Burger, which was was OK, but nothing remarkable. Dessert, however, was great: we shared a a sumptuous bourbon chocolate cake and delicious creme brûlée. 

The atmosphere was romantic, both inside and out, and the service outstanding. And for guests who aren't big on wine, there's also a terrific selection of cocktails and craft beer.  We'll definitely make another visit to Corkbuzz, and I'm hopeful that some of their other entrees will be as memorable as the wine and desserts."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal with friendly staff. The trout was recommended by the host and it didn't disappoint. We also had the goat cheese dumplings and they really hit the spot. I want to have them again - they were topped with shrimp which was a great compliment. I would like to bring my husband here who has excellent taste in food."}
{"text":"We had dinner last evening to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary at Corkbuzz.  We wanted a 'close' by us location wise and quaint atmosphere as it was just the 2 of us as we wanted to \"celebrate\" our day but had had a very busy weekend with family (our daughter is getting married and we had just hosted a party at our home) and this fit the bill perfectly for a quiet night just to ourselves!  Atmosphere is very nice and Corkbuzz has a \"cozy\" feel but yet it speaks volumes with the décor.   Nicely done!  The food was great (donuts were a nice 'ending' to a great meal!) and we enjoyed ourselves.  Definitely will be back!  Great job Corkbuzz!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and ambiance. Love the vibe of the place. Had dinner there for restaurant week and the food was amazing!!  Was super surprised to get such delicious food and amazing service from a wine bar."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week $35 for 3 courses

First 
Smoke salmon lox with picked cabbage slaw, sliced apples, ikura caviar and basil. 

First off the fish was way too salty. It does not make sense to put ikura caviar on a already salty smoked salmon. And the smoke salmon tasted old. 

Second course 
Braised pork shoulder and potato gnocchi , portobello mushrooms 

Nothing special. It just tasted like roast pork with sauteed mushrooms

Third course 
Ricotta doughnut with cinnamon sugar, Almond milk

Which the best part of the dinner. Doughnuts was soft and airy. Not too sweet"}
{"text":"Monday's just got better! Corkbuzz offers by BOGO free bottle of wine! Awesome right? But here's the hard part.... who gets the bottle??

This was my first time here, Corkbuzz is sort of tucked away behind Whole Foods. I believe there's a parking deck.

Hello, Strawberry meringue pie! The BEST EVER!!!!! My favorite part was the crust! I loved the tiny pieces of Pistachios!!! I also had the pleasure of trying the churros, which were amazing! Light and airy! Came with three dipping sauces ( which you won't need) 

They have a large wine selection. Kinda hard to narrow down. Our waitress suggested a Riesling, which was perfection! 

I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here. I heard there's lots of specials each week. I definitely need to do my research. Oh! I almost forgot! The bottle! By one of my friends took it home. I hope she enjoyed'"}
{"text":"Holy yummy! Corkbuzz is uh-mazing!!! I actually had no plans of coming here until I won a 70$ gift card through a Yelp talk thread, thanks Nikki! But boy am I glad I won! 

So we came during restaurant week and the menu was pretty lengthy for it being restaurant week. There were a lot choices and there was enough to satisfy anyone's taste. We started off with an order of the tater tots which were not on the restaurant week menu but so delicious! The mustardy sauce they were served with was a perfect added flavor. I got the beet salad for an appetizer (so good and I don't normally eat beets) but anything with goat cheese in the mix I'll take! My boyfriend got the crab bisque, creamy and satisfying (and again, another thing I usually don't enjoy!). The pork tenderloin was out of this world! So tender, and tasty and the apple slaw added a sweetness that I wasn't expecting! I tried my boyfriends shrimp orrichiette, OMG, this restaurant just kept getting better and better. All I can say is creamy and cheesy!!! 

The dessert might have been the best part. The ice cream sandwich was no ordinary dessert. Perfectly crunchy cookies with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella! The doughnuts with ricotta dipping sauce...outstanding. They were so warm and clearly made fresh! I was sooo full by the end of this meal but still wanted more, always a good sign!  

The overall experience was fantastic. The interior is really nice, dim lighting, romantic setting if you're looking for a nice date night. The service was a little slow but I blame that on restaurant week, not for a lack of caring on the employees part. But regardless, I cannot wait to return to Corkbuzz and try the full menu!"}
{"text":"Very glad I found this place via a fundraiser book. I was not expecting it to be as good as it is, but was pleasantly surprised. The NC trout with crab mousse, broccoli fondue, potatoes, and pear was amazing. I'm not a trout fan, but this was prepared perfectly. The burger was really good too with some fancy cheese and other stuff. Will definitely come back again so I can try the rest of the menu. The menu is limited but what they have all sounds yummy! Believe there are slight changes to how things are prepared based on what's in season, but a great way to change things up. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to the opening of Corkbuzz Charlotte for months and it certainly lived up to expectations! The layout is beautiful and the music is upbeat - both help to create a friendly and inviting ambience. Most impressive for me was the food, perhaps the best I've had in Charlotte. The gougeres, braised octopus, chicken-fried rabbit, clam spaghetti, and bourguignon burger were a few standouts but honestly everything I tried was tremendous. The staff is also extremely knowledgeable about wine and gave us great recommendations to pair with each dish. 

They also have some unique weekend promotions that are worth checking out. They offer blind tasting wine flights on Fridays that are perfect for a date. And Champagne Campaign (50% off all bottles of Champagne) is offered all day Saturday and Sunday. 

Can't say enough good things - Corkbuzz is the perfect addition to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Everything we got was mouthwatering. The menu is new today and full of all my favorites... Love it when it's agonizing to decide. Did the crab bisque and chicken and both were top notch. My husband was raving over the deviled eggs.  Next time looking forward to the short ribs, trout, scallops.... And I have to try the bourbon and bacon charcuterie."}
{"text":"Wow - this place is a great addition to Charlotte. Super knowledgeable staff, great selection, delicious food. A perfect place for our girls night out. Would also be great for a date night or a group. Restaurant is extremely clean (yes!) and parking was easy even though it seems like it wouldn't be based on location. So don't be deterred! I also felt compelled to call them today to let them know that their ads that seem to be playing very regularly on 107.9FM pronounced 'master sommelier' as 'master saw-mill-yeer'. Kind of a big deal when you're a wine bar with a sommelier at this level. :)"}
{"text":"Wine bars are not really my thing. But a wine bar with food? I will definitely give that a try. So we checked them out on a weekend morning for their brunch menu. Actually showed up as they opened. And \"as they opened\" means at the time their hours said they opened.

Turns out the door was open, but no one was around. Stood looking goofy (which I do really well) for a few minutes, and was just about to leave when someone came out and seemed happy to see us. We were seated and a few minutes later our order was placed.

After a while, we had some food. It wasn't bad food, but it wasn't great.

And more importantly, the wait was loooong. If you're there for wine, and sitting and enjoying the wine, then it would probably not be an issue. But if you're going for a meal, and perhaps more importantly, have things to do, perhaps not the greatest choice.

The decor is nice, and the location is interesting - and there are other places around that also seem worth checking out as well - but if you want to go for a meal, it's probably not the best option."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 6 one week in advance and were clear about food allergies. On a Saturday night they were out of gluten free bread, the restaurant was at maybe 75% full and it took 1 hour to get bread and dinner came an hour after that. We've been here a few times before. With so many restaurant choices in Charlotte, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch, drinks or dinner though lunch would not include wine normally. The staff is great, food is amazing and the care of the wine menu is superb. We went for Queens Feast this year for a change and the most impressive thing besides the food was a Restaurant Week wine list that had very affordable wine bottles, $25-35 bottles on top of their normal list. Helpful when we had 3 couples going and went through a couple of bottles. 

 I had the pork roulette, the burger and the fudge. Great combo and the burger was perfect with amazingly crisp shoestring fries. Perfectly seasoned. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had the best food of my life, served with the most perfect paired wines in a wonderful atmosphere, and a very kind, knowledgeable server. Can't say enough good things about this place. Our group of 4 were all so impressed. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We met friends here, and I was a little skeptical ahead of time as I am not usually a fan of the South Park area in general. 
We lucked out with parking, but I saw there is valet also, so consider that a plus. 
Because we were five people, there was a good sampling of menu items on the table to try. 
The Hush Puppies w pimento cheese were very good. Hot and crisp and the sharp cheese flavor was a great compliment. The charcuterie platter was not all that, but we also tried the octopus which was tender and flavorful. 
For vegetarians, the carrot gnocchi is a win, but I think the roasted cauliflower was one of the best dishes on the table with added roasted shallots, pecorino cheese, capers and lemon. I could have just eaten that and been completely satisfied. 
Service was attentive. 
I may not make it a point to revisit, but would not complain if someone else suggested it. 
Worth a try if you have not been there."}
{"text":"Great chill atmosphere. Excellent wine selection & offerings whether  by the glass, flights or bottles. 
Outstanding staff, well mannered, very knowledge, attentive & welcoming."}
{"text":"My review may be slightly misleading because it is solely about the private event space. My book club recently met at Corkbuzz, and it was a fantastic choice. The private room is indeed private. The door and walled-off space definitely helped reduce the noise from the restaurant, and the room has its own sound system so you can choose to listen to music or not. One of the amazing things though was that there was not a charge to use it on a weeknight. Another awesome thing was the service. The waitstaff was very pleasant and very accommodating to our group. They let us control the pacing for the evening and did not rush us to order or to get out. I look forward to dining in the main restaurant space soon."}
{"text":"When I first heard this place was moving in a year ago, I literally watched for updates, started following them on Twitter,  doing drive Bys seeing if the coming soon sign had a date, cyber stalking press releases...you get the idea.  I was obsessed with finding out when they were opening....

....and then they did...

My first experience here was really incredible.  My hubs signed us up for the Burgers and Rosé wine tasting.  Although they had my hubs reservation wrong,  they caught it and called him twice to apologize and to reconfirm.  So problem solved even before we got there and they were sooooo nice about it.  

We arrived a little earlier than planned and sat at the bar and ordered a glass of bubbly.  Bar tender was professional, and was nice.  Told us about the prosecco that we ordered and offered us a taste to see if we would like it. 

Off to the tasting event we go!! 

We move into a long dinning room with an elegantly decorated table.  The rosé had already been poured into 6 different wine glasses all sitting on top of numbered spaces ...so you could quickly reference which wine you were drinking.  Hard to explain but so well organized and beautifully presented.  

I felt awkward because I am just starting out my journey in learning about wines so I just knew that everyone that had signed up for this class were going to be wine know-it-alls....boy was I wrong.  The atmosphere was relaxed and everyone was nice, engaging, and there to have a good time and learn! The guy teaching us went through the history of rosé, where it started from, how it's made and the regions of the wines we were tasting.  So much fun and I actually learned something!  Most wine tastings are not as knowledgable or its a distributor trying to get you to buy a certain wine but don't know anything about the process.  Not this fella...he knew his stuff!  After tasting the six different wines, our food came out and we kept getting top offs of whatever wine you wanted to try again...and again...and OMG.  Lol! 

I almost forgot to write about the food!

The burger was had was ridiculous in a good way.  Nice fat juicy burger with some type of garnish that was amazing.  Totally impressed. 

The wine prices are RETAILLLLL not restaurant rip off.  I bout two bottles.  So well worth it! 

I seriously will be celebrating my birthday, Christmas, sunny days, wine down Wednesday's at this establishment.  There is a patio for our door seating, and complimentary valet because parking is a bit challenging in that location.  The restaurant interior is small however I think that's pretty cool. It forces more intimate conversations in smaller groups.  

*standing and clapping* Well done Corkbuzz.  You had me had hello."}
{"text":"What is up with guy behind bar?  Third time in and I feel like I'm interrupting him.  Not sure if he's a bartender or owner Too bad. Just a great looking bar."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful spot nestled away in the South Park area.  I have been here twice and have sat both in and outside.  I really like the inside area, it's beautifully decorated and has a great atmosphere. 

The bartender was very nice and personable.  They have options for wines by the glass, flights, and bottles.  Monday nights the have buy a bottle, get one free!  Pretty awesome deal.  They also have small bites. The ones I've had are all delish!

I really think this is a nice place for a date, or just to unwind after work.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yuck!  EVERYTHING we ate (salad, multiple appetizers) had their \"signature\" smoked cheese on it.  So overpowering!  Service was poor. Gave 2 stars SOLELY for the good wine and chill atmosphere.  With all the amazing restaurants in Charlotte, we will not be back there and would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"Overpriced,overpriced,overpriced. Not sure who is rating this higher than 2-3 stars unless they just have too much money. 6 of us had dinner and were disappointed for the exorbitant cost. Scallops were good but 3 scallops with no other offering for $26 dollars???? Tater tots were mediocre and would have been better off getting hash browns at at chick a fila. Salmon tartar was inedible and pumpkin custard taste like a sponge and we had them take it off menu. Burgers were ok but $14??

Go somewhere else for cost!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Two girlfriends and I had reservations at Corkbuzz during restaurant week. I will go back because I'm dying to try the braised short ribs and I very much enjoyed the food and wine. The beginning of our experience was not great in that my friend had made reservations a couple weeks prior for a party of six, then changed to a party of 3. She called at 4 pm on the day of our 6 pm reservations just to confirm. On the way to the restaurant, she received an email that our reservation had been cancelled. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and we enjoyed the wine recommendations and charcuterie while we waited at the bar, but this is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Big faux pas to inadvertently cancel a reservation, imho.

The food was very good. Do not visit without trying their house made ricotta and apple chutney with a nice full-bodied red. Heaven in the mouth. The truffled salami was awesome as was the very unique crisp yet creamy smoked Gouda. Their house made Dijon was also outstanding, if we're being detailed. 

Apps: we had the Smoked trout dip, Brussels sprouts and Wagyu Beef carpaccio. All were good. The smoked trout dip came with house made chips and though good, was my least favorite as I felt it was similar to other dishes elsewhere. Just not that special. The Wagyu beef carpaccio was quite good as was the presentation with a poached egg in the center. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts - grilled with fennel, marcona almonds and tossed with cheese curds it was delicious!

I had the pork tenderloin, cooked medium and it was absolutely cooked to perfection and the apple slaw was a perfect compliment. One of my friends had cornmeal-crusted catfish which I do not believe it is on the regular menu but it was also delicious. My other friend had the shrimp orecchiette and it was quite good - very hearty 'comfort food' type dish. We also got the ham-hock tater tots (great!) and roasted spaghetti squash (not my fav). All was very good and we really were too stuffed for dessert. But...

We tried the ricotta doughnuts, chocolate chip cookie sandwich with hazelnut ice cream and apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. The ricotta donuts were sugared donut holes with a ricotta cream. Good but like the cookie, not over the top delicious. I was hoping for more of the regular house-made ricotta, yum. My favorite was the apple cobbler - sugar biscuit crumble, very tasty. 

All in all Corkbuzz was a nice little wine and venue. A little pricey but what you expect in the area. The space is tight and acoustics maybe need to be softened, but overall I'd recommend for the food, service and wine list. Enjoyed."}
{"text":"Pros:
Extremely attentive, knowledgeable and friendly staff - the beverage manager sat us and chatted for awhile 
Great atmosphere
Very impressive wine list 
Great cheeseboard 
We were seated right away

Cons:
Small food menu, but everything was delicious!

Would I go back? Absolutely! It's great for happy hour or a casual wine night. It could also be great for a larger group!"}
{"text":"Best Cosmo I have ever had! Hands down. Smoothest, tastiest, least tart Cosmo I have ever had. It was perfect. This was the end of a delightful evening at Corkbuzz. The bartender was very attentive, and his recommendations were on point. I began with the flight of Spanish wines. Really enjoyed it. We enjoyed some apps-gougères (not what I'm used to-made with goat cheese), but good. We had two cheeses and a meat, the Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. 
The Brussels sprouts were our of this wor! Perfectly seasoned and cooked, just the right amount of crispiness. The cauliflower was rich, but sooooo good. The cheeses combined with the salami were just right. Try the ricotta, and the wild boar salami!

I look forward to getting back to Charlotte soon for another great wine filled evening!"}
{"text":"I went to Corkbuzz for the first time last night and was immediately impressed. The place is beautiful. I did not have dinner, but just a couple glasses of wine.  The entire staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. David was behind the bar and was very helpful in the wine selection of his guests. He engages in conversation without being forced or fake. I will definitely be back soon. Next time I'll try something off the menu."}
{"text":"I'm not into big reviews so I won't say much be I was a big fan of the place.  The service was a little slow for my liking but the food was awesome! Everything we had was great. I will return"}
{"text":"As someone who works in the service industry, the two most important things to me are food and service, and Corkbuzz is on point with both. I went with a group of four so was lucky enough to try an array of food. Somehow, they've managed to fit three of my favorite things into one, with the Bourbon and Bacon Salami (unreal!). I loved everything, but my absolute favorites were the Goat Cheese Dumplings and the Bourguignon Burger. Austin was our server and he was just the right amount of friendly and attentive. I was only visiting Charlotte, but next time I go back, I will for sure be going to Corkbuzz again. Highly recommend for anyone who loves good food and good wine!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place two chances before I posted a review.  Upon my first try to Corkbuzz, the first complaint was the sign.  None of my friends could find the place.  I was told they are getting a new sign.  The inside of Corkbuzz is very attractive.  They have a beautiful private room that looks to seat around 20, with a long rectangular table and abstract art.  I would love to use it sometime.  

Now to the important part...the food. One reason I wanted to wait is because I felt like maybe I ordered wrong the first time.  The waitress pushed how the braised octopus was the best thing on the menu.  She went as far to say there has never been anyone who did not like it. I am an adventurous eater, so I ordered it, of course.  Maybe octopus is just not my thing, but I did not enjoy it. I also ordered the cured salmon.  It was very fresh and looked pretty on the plate, but a bit plain. I tried the trout, nothing memorable, but not bad.   Fast forward to my second trip back.  Again, the waiter raved about the braised octopus! I decided to order the warm olives, which were well seasoned and interesting.   I also ordered the crab cake, which came on top of overflowing aioli with a scoop of tomato jam on top.  Both the aioli and jam were way too much for the crab cake.  I did think the both had a nice flavor, but you only need a smear of the jam, not a hefty scoop.  It was too sweet if I had eaten it, as served.  The crab cake itself was pretty good.  The greens beside the crab cake were delightful!  I tried the scallops over spaghetti squash and they were tasty.  I could not get enough of the spaghetti squash, it was perfection.  As far as the wine, I enjoyed it both times and found the list impressive.  Our servers both times seemed knowledgable about the wines.

The bottom line is that I will be back. There are improvements to be made with some of the dishes. And last but not least - stop pushing the braised octopus!  It really is not for everyone!"}
{"text":"I want to love Corkbuzz but instead will say I like it (have been there 3 or 4 times since its opening). I went to Corkbuzz on opening week for dinner with a group and the kitchen was slow which is to be expected for a new restaurant. I ordered the Roasted Chicken and a glass of wine and both were good. None of us had any complaints about the food or drink.

The next few times I went to Corkbuzz, I was with a group of girlfriends where we ordered mixed drinks, wine and appetizers to share. The wine list is extensive and awesome and predictably pricey -- especially given the location.  

The good...
-The food (Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cheese plates, spiced nuts, olives)
-The wine

The not so good...
-The slow service (continued over multiple visits)
-The very loud, ridiculously loud, dining area 

The nit-picky...
-Given the pricey wine list and high rent locale, I am not that impressed with the décor and space. Corkbuzz reminds me of a basic space that you'd find in a hotel designated lounge/wine/hangout area. It reminds me of a lobby."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere was pleasant,  very \"South Park meets NYC\".  The bartender was nice enough.  Seemed slightly indifferent, no friendly vibe whatsoever, but not blatantly rude. He was very quick to refill when needed. 

  I only had the wine,  a syrah blend.  Was it a nice wine?  Yes. Was it worth  $13 a glass?  To me,  no. 

 Maybe I'm just a simple girl who doesn't understand wine (or places like this).  But I'd rather spend $13 on a bottle and stay home in my sweats..... and get white girl wasted solo. 

If you are OK with spending $12-15 per glass go here,  you won't be disappointed.  I'll continue being super classy and drinking my Harris Teeter bought wine at home.  (Would go back,  but only if someone else is buying...)"}
{"text":"Took the lady here for a birthday celebration, and this was our first time ever going to a wine bar. Wow. Corkbuzz definitely exceeded our expectations as far as service, professionalism, knowledge, and quality of food and drink. And this was their soft opening!!

When you walk in, you can definitely see that this place came straight from New York. The ambiance is very cool, very modern, chique. I'll admit, when we both opened the menu, neither of us recognized many styles of the bottles, but they didn't treat it pretentiously. We told our waitress about the styles that we normally like, and she recommended a fantastic french wine called... *checks phone*...eh, doesn't matter, it was a Cotes du Rhone. And it was fantastic. 

What I really like is Corkbuzz's policy on tasting. They pour a little bit table-side and let you taste anything before you commit to it, even glasses. What a cool policy.

We ordered food as well; I got the burger and it was out of this world. A couple other people at our table ordered some oysters which were great as well. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Corkbuzz's great food and great service complement each other like cheese and... I'll let your mind be responsible for the cheesiness."}
{"text":"Excellent service with very knowledgeable bar staff. 

Nice outdoor seating area but the ambiance inside is where it's at.  Great place to bring a group.  You can hear each other talk and not be on top of the tables next to you.

Reasonable prices for a wine bar."}
{"text":"Like Rachel A. my review may be solely based on a private wine tasting event in their private room.

A friend of mine chose Corkbuzz for a wine tasting event based on the wines offered and menu items available. We had reservations for 6 people at 7:00pm.  Once we arrived we were taken to their private room that was divided into two parties, ours and one other that had not yet arrived.  To start the tasting off the manager and wine coneisseur went over how the night/tastings were going to work. They allowed us time to order some small bites to enjoy during the tastings. We chose to order two charcuterie platters, which came with some meat, cheeses and accompaniments, which were perfect.

We tasted six wines, which I thought was a nice variety, and received the history of each.  Once the tasting was over we enjoyed the remainder of the bottles, decided to have some dinner and dessert. We ordered a variety of food items which everyone seemed to enjoy.  The service was definitely slower, especially once the second party joined the room.
Overall I enjoyed the tasting and food and would definitely go back as I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and would love to try some other items."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago. Absolutely amazing food. I had the burger and it was incredible, and my wife had the roasted chicken which she also said was amazing. 

Only and major downside. It was incredibly loud to the point of not being able to have a conversation. 

We will go back!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening I wanted to spoil my husband by taking him out to a place he'd never been. I decided to try Corkbuzz since I'd walked in during the day a couple of weeks earlier but had never been there as a customer. I was impressed right off the bat with how beautiful the space was! All twinkly and inviting, with an impressive display of wine and the beautiful rack of wine glasses lit up like art! The bartender treated us like old friends, and the wine list he shared with us had my head spinning - the choices are endless. Everyone was helpful and nice, and the staff made us feel right at home. The thought of all those wines I didn't get around to on Saturday makes me want to head back over there right now .. this is a must-try place if you enjoy great food and wine! I think Corkbuzz is raising the bar in Charlotte, and we're ready for it!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great atmosphere with a wide variety of wine selections. The food was outstanding. We ordered the Chicken Liver mousse, Octopus and split the Burger. I can't even pick a favorite out of those 3 because they were all amazing.  One word of caution - we allowed the bartender to choose a wine for us to try (after saying that I liked Tempranillo) and it turned out to be $20/glass. Not a huge deal for some people...but I also made a point to ask how much it was and that question went unanswered.  Other than that it was amazing and I'll definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
