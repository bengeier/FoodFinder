{"text":"Great lunch place!! I've never been too adventurous as an eater, but I've tried a variety of things here. It's all excellent. My go to is the chicken schwarma with the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Consistent, friendly, and tasty. I could eat it every day. Best falafel in town."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Friendly and clean service and also delicious and cheaper than other cuisines."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch downtown. I haven't had a bad dish here and it's always full for lunch. My favorite is the Kafta."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am crazy about a good falafel and this place has them! The staff and owners are very friendly also. I am happy I was walking past one day and decided to give it a try. Best decision I made. :)"}
{"text":"I went there about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended up with the dregs, but ....  One of my favorite reasons to eat Mediterranean is the fresh bread. Their bread was sitting out, bagged, near the register. It may have been cooked that day, but I expected it fresh off the grill.  The same for the chicken. I'm used to the chicken being cooked after I order it. This had been sitting out. It was less dry than I expected given that it'd been sitting out, but it wasn't good.   The hummus had a bitter taste. The rice pilaf was adequate.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"I work downtown, and this is my go-to lunch spot. The chicken shawarma a with garlic sauce is my favorite. The baba ghanoush is out of this world. The grape leaves and sleek are also noteworthy.  Service is fast and friendly. The owner is always at the register with a big smile. If you ask nicely he'll give you a sample cup of anything you may want to taste."}
{"text":"Found this place at random while walking around during lunch break for jury duty. The food was great, as was the service."}
{"text":"I have been to Israel numerous times and have eaten at the best middle eastern restaurants in NYC and this was the best falafel I have ever had! My sister got chicken shawarma which was excellent. The garlic sauce is amazing so make sure to ask for some on the side - good for fry dipping. Everything is fresh. So if you want some authentic, homemade middle eastern cuisine be sure to Check this place out."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat downtown!  The food is so fresh and tasty, and the people who work there are so nice.  The portions were generous and they let me create my own platter, because I didn't order straight off the menu.  Didn't get the chicken but will try it next time.  Grape leaves looked amazing.  The sleek and the beans were delicious, and so were the green beans.  The hummus was not my favorite type of hummus, I prefer more lemony - stronger favor, but it was still good.  Garlic sauce was great, too!"}
{"text":"Great chicken shawarma and a really yummy falafel wrap. Nice place. You may find parking right outside. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious Syrian food. The falafel was great, but the fresh sides are the real attraction. This should be the most popular lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to eat downtown, if not all of PIttsburgh. The Chicken Schwarma with garlic sauce is awesome, so are all of the side dishes. The hummus is so good you can eat it with a spoon."}
{"text":"The owners are super friendly & informative. If you're unsure of the items on the menu, they would show & tell you exactly what is in each of the food options. Don't be scared to ask!   Food is delicious! I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something different than the typical American food."}
{"text":"This place is one of our regular lunch haunts. We've been coming here since it opened. It's definitely in the rotation, and I can always count on a reliable, reasonably priced lunch.  My favorite selections include the Chicken Shawarma Entree which includes chicken from the spit (like the Greeks do for beef/lamb on gyros)  The entree includes two sides from a great selection of different choices. My favorite sides are the Tabbouleh (sometimes spelled tabouli) which is \"tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt\" (Thank you Wikipedia) and Fattoush which is cucumber, tomato, onion, and parsley. Their Fattoush is different from Aladdin's with the toasted pita bread in it, but definitely no less delicious!  Be sure and get the yogurt sauce(think Greek cucumber tzatziki sauce) with it. The chicken can definitely be dry --- you must use sauce here! The garlic sauce is a little too much for me --- although I'd say try it if you like garlic.  My meal comes out to be about $10 with a bottled drink from the cooler. They give you a ton of chicken, and the value is really great here. It includes pita bread.  The cashier, who I believe is the owner, is always super friendly and efficient.  You won't be disappointed with lunch here!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I could eat here every single day. The shish kebabs (lamb) are SO delicious, and I always ask for extra garlic sauce. I could drink that stuff.. seriously. I would put it on anything and everything, it is so good! I am also a huge fan of their tabbouleh and the loubieh. Tabbouleh is definitely one of those things I could eat until I burst, and theirs is probably the best I've ever had. Honestly, even the rice sides and potatoes are awesome here. I cannot recommend this place enough. Besides their food being incredible, the family is just so sweet and absolutely lovely. There was a period of about a year and half that I didn't work downtown, and when I started my new job and came in for lunch, Mario recognized me right away and asked how I was doing. Do yourself a favor and stop in if you haven't already! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Ask for shawarma with extra garlic sauce."}
{"text":"This place is great. Everything is fresh, delicious and homemade and prices are reasonable. The owner (I believe) is always working the register and is such a nice, friendly guy. He remembers you and your order. This is my go to spot for a delicious and healthier lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I never thought to stop in, mostly because I work on the other side of downtown. Plus, it didn't really draw my attention for whatever reason. However, when my husband told me that one of his coworkers comes here for lunch every single day, I figured it has to be good, right?  I went in for lunch with a friend and we each got the Chicken Shawarma. It came with two sides so I got the Tabbouli and Loubieh (green beans). For under $10, the portions were huge; I had enough for lunch and dinner. I was a little nervous the chicken would be dry but it was quite the opposite. I opted to get the sauce on the side and the chicken on its own was delicious and flavorful. Although the sauce does add a nice creamy garlic flavor. The sides tasted very fresh, particularly the Tabbouli. The green beans were full of flavor and were also a very nice addition to the meal.   There are plenty of options for sides so you can make many different combinations. The owners and workers are very nice and welcoming as well. Overall, great place for a quick lunch. Most of the options are pretty healthy too. I will definitely be back when my next craving for Mediterranean strikes."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place many of times on my lunch breaks while working downtown. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. The decor inside is nothing spectacular but no one comes here for that. They come here for the amazing service and the excellent food.   As soon as you get in line you are greeted by one of the staff members, most of the time being the owners themselves. If there is anything you have never tried or wish to try the employees gladly give you samples, at no cost!! They are always friendly and smiling!!   I get the Chicken Shwarma entree with 2 sides. A small side of rice pilaf and extra house salad accompany the main attraction being the Shwarma. It is prepared on a large skewer similar to one that cooks lamb meat for gyros. Always delicious and never dried out or over cooked. And the garlic sauce that accompanies the meal is amazing!   Friendly Staff, Amazing Food, Reasonably priced, and you can eat in and be done in less than 30 minutes, plenty of time for a lunch break!!"}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant where owners focus on customer satisfaction. Delivers a variety of middle eastern food that will keep you coming. Love their chicken shawarma sandwiches and salad."}
{"text":"My colleagues and myself love this place. Their chicken gyro and fatoosh salad is awesome."}
{"text":"I usually stop here once a week for lunch. I'm a fan of the kebabs and roasted chicken. Their roasted potatoes and fattoush are my favorite side dishes. The service is great, and the food is homemade. There is seating downstairs as well (I didn't know this for the longest time). A must try spot!"}
{"text":"Probably the nicest restaurant owners in downtown Pittsburgh.  This place gets busy during lunch and they surely make a killing...i'd be happy too.  Price is good, lots of options.  It's pretty small inside but they do have seating downstairs to compensate."}
{"text":"This is literally my goto place at least once a week.  The portions are massive, prices extremely reasonable and service- impeccable.  From the moment you walk in to, to order and receiving your food, you are treated like family.   My usual is the chicken shawarma platter; however, I enjoy the kabobs and falafel on occasion.  My absolute favorite sides are the tabouli and meat grape leaves *included in an entree. I also love the hummus and all meals come with very good pita bread in a cool ziplock bag to either eat or pass to someone else safely (ziplock protection).  All my coworkers absolutely love this place when I take them there, they then take their friends and family who work in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Mediterranean food! I love the selection here. My new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"The best hummus I have ever had the pleasure of devouring is here. No trip to the Pitt is complete without some hummus and tabouli and maybe some shwarma if I am feelin' meaty.   Service is fast, but always with a smile. Clean for eating in, though small so I usually just take it to go. It's counter service. Order and by the time you pay, your order is ready. Oh and when you pay, you will look twice. So inexpensive.   Till next time, Madonna's!"}
{"text":"The most delicious grape leaves, hummus,  falafel & chicken shawarma!!!! Yum!! The owners are warm & friendly and the prices are reasonable. Don't miss this little gem."}
{"text":"I visit this place at least once a week for lunch downtown. I have never had a bad experience. The lamb shishkabobs are amazing!! The hummas and tabule are among the best I have ever had. The place is clean and the employees friendly!  And omg the bubba!!"}
{"text":"Madonna's is a good place to go for lunch downtown. The prices are low for the portions you get, and the food is prepared well. The staff are very friendly. There can sometimes be a line, but it moves quicker than you'd expect, so don't be discouraged."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so today! I work downtown and stopped at Madonna's for lunch around 12:30. The line was fairly long, but it moved quickly. I got the chicken shawarma meal with tabbouli and hummus. Also got a side of four meat grape leaves. And they throw in pita bread for free. In total I spent around $12 and the amount of food they gave me insane. I'm saving more than half for lunch tomorrow!  Everything was very fresh and healthy with great flavor. The owners are very sweet and you can tell they are proud of their business. As they should be! I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of those occasions when I wish that I could add additional stars on top of the already awarded 5 star reviews.  Madonna's is beyond delicious. I not only love the roasted chicken I fiend for the roasted chicken. So supple is that leg and thigh that falls away from the bone. Always great and cheerful service and always delicious eats!"}
{"text":"Good Stuff!  I was in Pittsburgh for 2 days on a business trip.   I actually visited Palmyra both days for lunch.   I love Middle Eastern Cuisine and this place definitely satisfied my craving.   The first day, I had the Chicken Shish Tawook pita sandwich and a side of tabouli and the second day I had the Shish Tawook entree which included 2 chicken skewers (with tasty yogurt/garlic sauce) and 2 sides, I chose hummus and tabouli.   I can't say enough great things about this food.   The chicken was tender and flavorful, the pita was soft and fresh, the hummus was just the right consistency and flavorful, as well.  The star of the show for me was the tabouli, prepared just the way that I like it, fresh with minimal onions, lots of chopped, ripe tomatoes, and just the right amount of lemon and olive oil.   Also the price was right, approx $8 each day for a delicious and satisfying lunch.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If yours looking for a convenient place in the middle of downtown that is quick and has great service for lunch this is a great option.  I stopped by around 12:15 on Tuesday and the line was going out the door.  It went very fast, basically as fast as the credit card machine could ring people up.  Everyone was very pleasant and my lunch was good.  I got the chicken shawarma with hummus and tabouli.  I do slightly like the same mean more from somewhere else downtown but for how close this is located I would certainly return.  If you like Mediterranean food be sure to give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch on a Friday while in town for a wedding.  The man behind the counter was the best! My gf had never had Mediterranean food really, and he went through and explained everything to her, making recommendations, mentioning where each dish was from, etc. Top notch service!  On top of that, the food was very tasty and pretty inexpensive. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I will absolutely stop by."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! From the pita to the baba to the grape leaves, everything is perfection.  The last time I was there, I got the veggie plate which really shouldn't be eaten in one sitting as it's a ton of food, but I definitely did any way.  I got the three hot veggies - lima beans, green beans and greens and beans.  All are amazing.  I also got the veggie grape leaves and the baba.  The baba might be my favorite - nice hunks of eggplant and a ton of flavor.  The people that work there are a delight and if you aren't smiling when you leave, you have done something wrong.  Go back and get the baba - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is now the only downtown lunch spot for me now. The food is fast, delicious and tastes super fresh. The staff are all very friendly and legitimately seem gracious to have your business. The prices are really fair for how much you get, and it is always nice to have a good vegetarian friendly spot for a fast cheap lunch. Can't say enough. Go."}
{"text":"Mario is a great host and friendly. His staff are. Very warm and welcoming.  I have had lunch there over 50 times and the food is consisrantly excellent.  His wife makes the hummus and other specialty items fresh.  The hummus is the very best in Pittsburgh and I've tried all of them in the city and strip district.  Falafel are cooked there too!  Warm and crisp - not oily.  Try the sleek, fatoosh and the lamb kabobs.  They are terrific!  Others say the chicken shwarma is the best there is with homemade garlic sauce.   Whatever you like, you cannot go wrong here!  Goof food made fresh, nice people and more lunch than you can likely finish for 8-10 dollars! #goodvalue #delicious"}
{"text":"I came here at 3:15 and nearly everything was gone except for the kofta, the falafel, and the sides. You know what? Everything was delicious. Even cold, the falafel was better than most of the best falafel so I've ever had, and the salads were tart, fresh, and perfect."}
{"text":"A downtown lunch winner. Highlights include tasty, authentic food; smiling, warm service; and generous portions at reasonable prices. The chicken shawarma, baba ganoush, and fattoush are my favorites. There's a reason there's a line out the door on any given day: great lunch. There's plenty of seating downstairs. I recommend Madonna's. Try pairing lunch at Madonna's with a walk over the Smithfield Street bridge."}
{"text":"The place is very cozy and enjoyable for a person that is looking for a delicius food! The options are great and the people who work there are so nice! The price is a positive aspect too! I totally recommend the place! I always have a great time there!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and find myself at Madonna's at least once a week for lunch.  The veggie platter is my go to order, and at $8 plus tax you can't beat it!   The wraps are delicious (add extra pickles!), and the grape leaves are some of the best I've ever had.  Also, everyone that works there is very friendly!  Madonna's is relatively new downtown, and I hope they stay around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem but it really deserves more recognition. The food is absolutely excellent and the service is perfect! Everyone who works there is so friendly and helpful. I really hope it continues to do well. All the meals taste really authentic. I always order the roasted chicken and it's absolutely delicious and falls right off the bone."}
{"text":"This is a little place that you might miss if you are not really looking for it. I couldn't believe that it took this long to find this place!!  I went there during lunch. The line wasn't too bad. There were plenty of sitting and the place is clean. The owners were really nice and friendly. I got the roasted chicken and rice and salad. Every main dish comes with two sides. We didn't stay to eat which I forgot to get the utensils and napkins. The food was really good. I really enjoyed their salad and rice. The chicken was juicy and tender. I think that it's priced fairly. I will definitely make more trips during lunch!!"}
{"text":"Excellent new offering from the owners of Madonna's Mexican Food.  They're in the spot by Subway and Pita Pit that was previously occupied by that one really shady pizza joint, serving up delicious falafel, shawarma, salads, and much more.  The food is cheap and delicious, and Mr. Moussa and his staff are super friendly. Stop by for a good, inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"Great downtown lunch spot. I've had a bunch of different dishes here and they are all delicious!  I've had the chicken, beef, lamb and most of the sides--never disappointed! I typically stop in for lunch and it's easy to get in and out and on your way.   The staff is always SO friendly, which is such a game-changer for me."}
{"text":"The best fast casual Mediterranean food I've found in Pittsburgh! Their tabbouleh is made the perfect way - more parsley, less bulgar. They are always friendly and fast too!! The prices are great and there are vegetarian options as well as really tasty roasted chicken. Also, and this is pretty important to me as far as Mediterranean food goes, their pita bread is FRESH. Not like the dry flaky stuff you might get elsewhere. It's so soft and malleable. Love Madonnas!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I walked through town to find a place to eat. I noticed everyone's lunch at madonna's looked delicious! We decided to check it  out. It had been awhile since i had middle eastern food in awhile so i was pretty excited.  I decided on the Kafta entree which stated that it was served with a side, a salad & pita. The lady taking my order said that i didnt have to choose salad-- i could get any 2 sides. I went with loubieh (green beans, tomatoes, onions, olive oil) & rice e/ lentils (i forget the official name) Bobby and I decided to split the entree since he had a large breakfast. Also, the owner gave us extra pita after finding out we were splitting the entree.   The food was delicious. Even after splitting it, we both became full quick (how often does that happen for lunch under $10?)."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and was able to answer any question that you had. The price was right for the portion that you got. However, I just tried Palmyra down the street and even though I didn't order the same thing, I thought that their food was slightly better."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this place-- a small, no frills, middle eastern restaurant in the middle of downtown.  You order and pay at the counter choosing from the options cafeteria style.  The food is fresh and you get it quickly.  I was very happy with the veggie platter."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch downtown. Everything I have ever had here is delicious. The owners are incredibly friendly. The value is second to none downtown. I typically split an entree with a coworker and I could not eat another bite. If they were open on the weekend I would come downtown just to have lunch here."}
{"text":"The owners and employees really round out the experience here. The food is perfect, and they are truly welcoming. Aladdin's is probably Madonna's biggest competition in Pittsburgh. I like Aladdin's a lot, but Madonna's falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush are superior. I would LOVE to see the owners of Madonna's team up with the Vegan Pittsburgh organization to get \"Vegan Friendly\" certified and label their vegan menu items. That's the one thing that Aladdin's has that Madonna's doesn't, and it's the only reason I choose Aladdin's more often. I love being able to look at the menu and quickly identify which options I have. Madonna's could do this easily!"}
{"text":"I wish I could describe my love for this place.  If you are looking for a fast, inexpensive, and homemade lunch in Pittsburgh, look at this place.  I've been here several times.  The hummus is out-of-this-world creamy, the falafel is fresh and hot, everything is flavored nicely.  I love that the family seems to be working together.  The guy that owns it and works the register always seems so happy.  I love coming here to eat!"}
{"text":"did a quick Yelp check to see what was close to hotel, this place looked like a quick walk and sounded good.  First - very large, very clean establishment. Seems family run which was also very nice.  Ordered chicken shawarma and a small babaganush.  The shawarma was dressed a bit differently that what i am accustomed to - had pickles and not the typical sauce and spices but it was good. The baba was good - had large chunks of eggplant and i prefer it a bit more smooth. Bottom line they make everything in here and that makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"Yup, this place has great mediterrean lunch!  Not much in the way of atmosphere but it's not meant to be fine dining.  Had a nice chat with the owner as well.  Nice change of pace from the veritable glut of chain lunch options."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some baba ganoush and decided to go to Madonna's.  This place hit the spot with their chicken schwarma with garlic sauce and a side of their baba ganoush.  The total cost for the chicken and 2 sides came to under $8.00.  The food always tastes fresh and is flavorful.  I highly recommend as a lunch spot for those working downtown.    The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is so good and the service is always friendly. I usually get the chicken schwarma pita and a side of grape leaves. The garlic sauce in the schwarma pita is amaaaaazing and I always get an extra on the side to dip my grape leaves in. I recommend this place for a fast and easy lunch, because even when the line is long it moves quickly!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food downtown. The ingredients are fresh, portions are generous, and the owners are exceptionally friendly. I always get the chicken shawarma entree with garlic sauce and two big scoops of hummus and tabouli, and I have yet to tire of it after more than a dozen times. Don't be scared of long lines at lunchtime - this place is a well-oiled machine. Staff will serve you quickly with a big smile!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Madonnas is the ONLY place to stop in for a quick lunch in downtown Pittsburgh. They sell out EVERY DAY for a reason. Cheap prices, top notch food, everybody is friendly, and they are FAST. If you dont get the chicken shwarma, youre doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. I had the chicken shwarma entree with tabouli (some of the best I've had) and potatoes. Good prices. Really friendly staff. Quick turnaround. If I lived in Pittsburgh, this would be a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Okay, I had to modify my review because I was previously wrong.  This place is awesome and the service is really as good as it can get.  If you get the pleasure of being served by the owner, you'll know why this is a five (5) star place.  They make you feel like family here.  Makes me wish I were Greek... or even an employee at this place."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in downtown Pittsburgh!   Great people inside too, very friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service. Mediterranean food always has good vegetarian options so that's a plus. I had the falafel sandwich for quick weekday lunch. Would go back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best place to get an affordable lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh. My biggest complaint is that they aren't open in the evenings when we're looking for a quick bite before or after the theater!    I've tried a few of their items and LOVE the tabbouleh, kafta, and roasted chicken quarters. The meat grape leaves are a bit inconsistent but always good. I keep intending to try new things at Madonna's but can't help but go back to my favorite things!   The service is super quick. I would prefer if they could switch to a more eco-friendly container than the styrofoam. I would be willing to pay more for that."}
{"text":"What can I say? Madonna's is a phenomenal lunch option in downtown Pittsburgh. I love Mediterranean food and Madonna's gets me my fix. It seems like a family run operation, which makes it even better.   In my 3 times at Madonna's I've always gotten the same thing: chicken shawarma entree with tabouli and hummus. It's so good I just can't bring myself to branch out! They have a house made garlic sauce that is to die for, so don't forget to add that to your shawarma (or anything, really). Additionally, all meals are served with a side of pita bread. Most meals come out to be around or under $10.  Madonna's is the perfect spot for a quick and relatively healthy lunch while in town."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in ATL. I recently traveled to PIT for work and walked over to Madonnas from my hotel for some lunch. I was not disappointed. The food was fast and fresh despite the line at the door, and everyone working behind the counter seemed to have a smile on their face. I highly recommend this as a quick and affordable lunch. The menu and selections offered were authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern style food at great prices. Easy to take to go or eat in. Highly recommend it!  I had the lamb kabobs, well cooked and tender, and I really liked their yougurt sauce.  They also have a good selection of rice and salads."}
{"text":"1. Best healthy food in downtown.  2. All food is made by themselves  3. Fresh (NOT FROZEN).  4. Best Mediterranean Cuisine  5. very personalised treatment. 6. Accept cards 7. Very cheap and cost effective ( $ ) 8. Just beside Pittsburgh Downtown macy's"}
{"text":"An older gentleman from Syria runs this place, and he's always a pleasure to see. The food is pretty good- always ask what's fresh. Chicken shish kebab is my favourite."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place to eat lunch after running errands in downtown. Their food was solid (I had been craving for tabbouleh and they nailed it), their price was reasonable, and their portion was pretty big. In fact, I had to take half of it home and eat it for dinner. The people behind the counter were very friendly as well. If they offered warm pita and added a tad more spices on their shawarma, they'd easily get 5 stars from me, but this is still a solid 4-4.5-star joint. Will visit again when in downtown."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on here for Madonna's, I decided I was going to give this place a try today. I've walk into this place a number of times and then walked out simply because I had no idea what any of the stuff behind the cafeteria style line was. But today I decided it was time to step outside my norm and throw my culinary caution to the wind. I'm glad I did.  Like James R. pointed out in his \"tip\", I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The lady on the serving line explained what each item was and told me that the lunch special consisted of \"one meat and two sides\".  I went with the kaftans for my meat choice (sort of a lamb and beef mini meatloaf) and for my two side dishes I choose the loubieh (green beans and onion in an oil, garlic, and herb dressing) and sleek (a collard greens and chick pea's dish).  It also came with a zip-lock baggy containing a couple of pita slices. Everything was delicious and I'm sure I'll be back again to try some of their other offerings.   Madonna's isn't exactly a plush or cozy place. The seating is more like what you would find in a fast food restaurant. But the service is quick and the food is good. I challenge you to step outside your culinary comfort zone during your next lunch break and discover something more than burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"A great lunch place, Madonna's provides delicious mediterranean (possibly Lebanese?) cuisine at an absurdly good price point. The sheer variety of vegetarian dishes make it difficult to want to have anything else, and the place will let you get in and out quickly, which makes it a great spot to grab lunch if you're in a bit of a hurry."}
{"text":"I've had a hankering for good Middle Eastern and my prayers have been answered.  Great food and great service with a smile!  A wonderful addition to my lunchtime rotation."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly.  The owner was walking around giving out samples and making sure everything was good.  I did not explore to many items the Falafel and the lamb pitas were good.    A good lunch option."}
{"text":"All of their food is excellent, cheap and homemade. Mario is super friendly. I'd recommend the shawarma , but everything I've had here is awesome. I come here 2-3 times per week."}
{"text":"A great quick place to grab a healthy lunch. The owners are extremely friendly! My go-to is always the Chicken Shawarma entree. With the entrees, you get a piece of pita bread and get to pick any two sides that they have up front (that even includes the Falafel - insanely delicious by the way, and I typically don't opt for falafel at most other places). The chicken shawarma is always hot off the rotisserie and topped with this amazing house-made garlic sauce.  Madonna's is the only place to go if you're seeking out a ton of delicious, healthy, food for a fantastic price point!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma with rice pilaf and hummus. It was very very good. The chicken is absolutely delicious and they give you huge portions of food. They employees were extremely friendly and the order process is quick and easy. It's perfect for a quick stop for lunch in the middle of the work day. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here! A group of us walked over around 11:30 AM for lunch one day. This is a mom and pop joint and it shows, really friendly service. I got a chicken schwarma platter with a side of hummus. The hummus was seriously delicious! Super creamy! I also loved the garlic sauce on the side, it was awesome. My whole platter was gigantic, it was impossible to finish all of it. I would definitely come here frequently if I worked downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during my visit to Pittsburgh today and fell in love with this place. The owners were very friendly and helpful. They helped me decide on what I wanted to order and everything was amazing and fresh. After my lunch, I even ordered more hummus to take home to my husband. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for a quick and simple bite to eat. I can't tell you the number of times I've walked along Smithfield Street and passed right by it. Now, I'll be the one pointing it out and planning more lunch dates with friends.   For this visit, I went with the Chicken Shawarma, Falafel, and Lubieh (green beans and tomatoes in olive oil). It was all delicious! The chicken was seasoned well and not dry, which was a concern of mine as I saw it turning on the vertical rotisserie.   The Loubieh was a great take on green beans and hopefully one that's easy to recreate, cause I'm going to give it a shot. And to top it off, I got the chicken and two  sides for just $8, such a steal! I will definitely be going back to try more."}
{"text":"Was a huge fan of Madonnas and I still miss my Conquistador salads but finally got around to coming down to the new place. Love it!  If its your first time Mario will walk you through what's what and the descriptions on the menu and labels make it easy if you're not familiar with the cousine. I admittedly wasn't, my only exposure to schwarma was the end of the Avengers movie.   Have been three times now. Have gotten the kofta entree, the mix of two meats entree with shish kabobs and schwarma, and the schwarma entree by itself .   It's all delicious. Schwarma is my favorite thus far and the garlic sauce is a must. Personally I go for the tabouli and roasted potatoes for sides. The baklava is perfect as well.   Definitely give it a try, and its so much food for the money too."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch while in town on business based on thier Yelp rating. They run a really efficient operation. It's really fast yet very good. I had the chicken swarma plate. The chicken was tasty and the garlic sauce lingered for hours (not a bad thing in my book). I enjoyed the sides too. It was healthier than many lunch options and an excellent value. I might just go back tomorrow. Great place!"}
{"text":"It's all been said before here on yelp- everyone is correct, very friendly people and delicious Mediterranean food. The only reason for the four stars for me was the meat selection was not quite as diverse as I would've expected. Nevertheless I had delicious shredded chicken with several sides. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Authentic and outstanding!  No bells or whistles. No frills. Just real Mediterranean food.  They were out of the chicken shwarma (their star-dish from the pictures) when I got there as they were cleaning up after the lunch rush so I had to try something else.   I had the beef sishkabob and there were no regrets! It was very tasty. Could be a little more tender but that's nit-picky-ness as everything was very good.  The rice was fluffy and well cooked. The potatos where tender and perfectly seasoned. The star of the show ends up being their garlic tzatziki sauce, though. Amazingly balanced, it went well with everything.  These guys know their greek food and they're doing it right!"}
{"text":"Fast, fairly priced, consistently delicious.   I have yet to be disappointed at Palmyra in the 10+ times I have been there. Their falafel is airy and nuanced, chicken shawarma is savory and well portioned and the kicker for me is the baba ghanoush - never too oily and always perfectly seasoned.   The people are friendly and will readily exchange light and witty banter or assist a new customer in the finer points of the menu. Palmyra is the perfect casual Mediterranean/Middle Eastern dining experience you can't really match anywhere else in the city. Especially for the price.   P.S. Very robust vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"The couple that run this fantastic restaurant are immigrants from Syria and they serve the finest food I've had for lunch downtown. Generous portions, reasonable prices and wonderful flavors that linger. I come here every day I have time to eat. I recommend it without reservation - they offer both vegetarian fare, in the photo, and lamb and chicken dishes. All are outstanding although I'm headed in the vegetarian/vegan direction, avoiding meat."}
