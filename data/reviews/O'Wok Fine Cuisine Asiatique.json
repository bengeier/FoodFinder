{"text":"Come to this neighbourhood one day, and my friend took me to this restaurant, and I was impressed.  I ordered a pad thai and also share my friend's dishes. The food taste good and you can notice they pour their heart in the details.  But what really surprise is their dessert. I had a ginger creme brulee, I never know ginger would go so well with custard sauce. Their fried banana is a must try too.  You can't find that kind of quality of food with that price in downtown. Highly recommand!"}
{"text":"Pire service jamais vue!! N'arrivez surtout pas peu de temps, (40 min) avant leur fermeture parce qu'ils ne se gêneront pas pour vous dire de quitter la place ou de prendre pour emporter dès qu'ils ferment leur portes!! Pour nous servir des plats qui prennent 10 minutes à préparer. Quel manque de délicatesse et de savoir vivre!! Nous étions de très bon clients mais plus jamais nous y retourneront! En passant le restaurant était encore plein! Très déçu!"}
{"text":"I ordered what they called their house specialty.  The meal was so bad, I took one bite and put it aside.  The sauce was tasty, the chicken was hard and uneatable.  I told the waiting staff and the person behind the counter.  They seem not to care and charged me for everything.  I am really disappointed with the food but mostly with their attitude toward a client who express dislike for something they made.  Lots of choice of food places in the area, I would choose a different one."}
{"text":"great food nice ambiance we have ordered more take out than eaten in On site the service is friendly and the ambiance nice. The food is excellent. This is good chinese food well both american cantonese and seshwan"}
{"text":"They removed all sushi from the menu. Very unfortunate to my opinion. It was the reason I was going to this restaurant because the service is there's weakness."}
{"text":"The only waiter there was very attentive and checked on me often so I'd say the service was pretty good.  The interior of the place was pretty small and crowded, but I sat at a table near the bar which was really pretty to look at. Not to mention, it had a Asian touch to it with the Buddhist statue there.  The menu had plenty to choose from but the layout of it seemed pretty crammed. The  dish (can't remember the name) I got under the noodles section was really filling and sweet despite what it seemed at first. It was reasonable for the price. However, the appetizers seemed a little pricey to me."}
{"text":"Loved the food hated the service. I felt like the cooking was honest and simple but most importantly fresh! We had Pad-Thai and chicken fried rice (very generous portions by the way) it was amazing. It is a clean modern restaurant with an open cuisine. The decor is simple chic and the menu is a bit busy but inexpensive for the quality.   Overall I will eat there again but I might elect to order out or get delivery in the future."}
{"text":"À part la soupe miso, le reste était mauvais. Riz blanc raté (il faut le faire!) et sec, légumes au gout douteux et sauces (arachide et général tao) si sucrées que les plats devraient être classés comme desserts. Et le poulet géneral tao pas cuit (encore saignant). Service siypathique mais ne mérite aucunement 4 étoiles. Déçu par Yelp."}
