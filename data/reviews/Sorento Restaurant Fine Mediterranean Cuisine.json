{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now. I really love the ground beef kebob, but the wood oven really gives the pizzas a nice flavour. It is pretty busy at lunch, I personally prefer coming in the evening for a nice sit down meal. The price overall is quite reasonable. I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend the place."}
{"text":"Pass by this quite often and finally decided to try it today. Surprisingly, we had a pretty decent experience. 

We were a little skeptical at first. It was pretty quiet...We were there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There were about 3 other parties there. There's a sign that said please wait to be seated so we waited but no one came. So we proceeded to walk in on our own then we saw a server peer from behind the counters. He gestured us to sit anywhere. Waited around for the menus...they finally came. Then the server disappeared again...

Eventually, we ordered the calamari to start. It was lightly battered not rubbery. It was okay nothing to write home about. We also had the chicken kebob platter and the Sorentos special steak pizza as well. Both were pretty good. Decent portion and good flavour. The pizza was a little different as it had a tomato aioli sauce. Interesting...but ok. 

Overall, it was a good experience and we'll be back to try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We'd eaten here before and really enjoyed the pizza, so were looking forward to a lovely dinner, and just ended up supremely disappointed. We made a reservation, expecting that most places are going to be crowded on Saturday evening. We would never expect to be seated for over 20 minutes without anyone so much as offering us water. Maybe I'm being harsh, but when a group of 8 was seated after us and is attended to with water before we are even acknowledged we decided to just up and leave. 
Not sure if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Yeah yo this place is lit af. Especially calamari. Like get the calamari because the breading is so bless like you'll wanna eat so many plates as your main course. 

I got a pasta dish it was called shrimp and scallop cacciatore which is good except my dumbass thought it was a cream dish but it was a tomato sauce dish. So I'm minusing one star for that. But YEAH YO. for price and service it's a pretty good place. Ch-ch-check it outttttttt."}
{"text":"I used to live in Toronto, and would frequent Sorento quite a bit (during lunch mostly, as I worked nearby).  I moved to the States a few years ago and recently returned to Toronto for a visit.  I just HAD to come back to Sorento!  I came with some of my friends on a Sunday afternoon/evening and we sat on the beautiful patio.  The ambiance was great.  Our server was very attentive, always checking on us.  We started out with a few appetizers: calamari was golden and crispy.  The tzatziki that came with it made for a great pairing.  We also ordered the hummus-you CANNOT find hummus like this ANYWHERE ELSE!  I've tried hummus at several different restaurants, bought hummus from the grocery store and I have not been able to find anything that matches this.  The bread they serve with the hummus is SO delicious as well, great combination.  For my main dish I ordered the combination kabob (ground beef and chicken).  Both were SO tender and cooked to perfection.  The rice is so fluffy and delicious, I've never had rice like this before.  I love the saffron on top, the presentation is just beautiful.  My friend ordered a pizza that she created herself and the crust was just right-crispy and delicious.  Another friend ordered the lamb shank and I tried a few bites.  I'm not normally a fan of lamb but this was just something else.  The sauce was just right.  For dessert we ordered some tiramisu.  They make the tiramisu at the restaurant and it is TO DIE FOR!  We paired it with cappuccinos and it really hit the spot.  I wish my stay was longer, so I could have gone back and ordered that lamb shank!  I guess that will have to wait until the next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favourite places in North York to eat.  The food tastes like home cooked!  The hummus plate is probably the best hummus I have had anywhere.  I also really enjoy the veal parmigiana.  Their wood oven pizza is not bad either.  They have a great selection of standard desserts (chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu, cherry cheese cake and apple pie) that are actually quite delicious!  The servers are super nice too."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was overall good. The warm mushroom salad was really good as was the cappuccino. Yeah I know who has cappuccino with dinner. 

Service was good. It was not super busy. 

They have put a lot into the decor. 

I suspect I should share a salad with my wife next time and order a pizza. The wood oven looks great."}
{"text":"Yum yum!!! Very reasonable prices and flavorful food!! We had calamari, carbonara and Napoli pizza ... Delicious!!! The Caesar salad wasn't bad but didn't impress. Should have tried this place sooner!!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to irk me. And this place did it. 

The food, was good. Nothing special, but it was good. That's where the positive ends. 

First off, we were a party of 10. So naturally, a 15% gratuity is added to the bill. Pretty standard. What was NOT standard, was the manner in which it was implemented. 

First, the receipt didn't even have the tip added to it. So when I wanted to pay by Credit Card, I was just going to add my standard 20% and be done with it. Well, that didn't happen. Instead of doing it like every other restaurant I've been to, (Simply adding the 15% to the total when you hand them the machine. If they ask, you simply tell them 15% has been added as per the menu) they did it their way.

I was handed the machine with my chip in and ready for my PIN. I thought it was a little odd, but continued. Bam! Transaction complete. No tip option, no displaying dollar value. Nothing. Just \"here's your receipt\". (NO! It doesn't work like that)

I looked at it, and she sure enough had added the 15%. Hey, no skin off my back if you want to be sneaky and not get my extra 5% tip. Not my problem. 

But it didn't end there. She didn't even serve us. She walked to the end of the table and had US pass everything down. The water, the food, the bills. Just about everything, she ONLY brought to the table. (Ok, some of the food, her other staff helped, but she didn't really move down the table accept to TAKE the order, and to pick up the bills. 

My co-worker only had water to drink, but there was a pop on the bill. When we told her that it was in error, she retorted back \"Well someone must have had it\". 

We had to explain that all the people who had pops, (4 of us) all had them on our bills. So she gave in. But we were in a hurry and were trying to get out, so we suggested, could we just pay it as if the coke wasn't on it, as we are in a hurry. (It took over 40 minutes for our food to get to our table) She said \"sure\" and walked away.  huh?????


So, we waited. She finally came back and we could pay the last bill and get out. We will not be going back. Not worth it. 

On a side note, I'm lactose intolerant. (I know, hard to go out for food) But usually there are SOME alternatives. EVERY pizza has mozzarella. No goat cheese pizzas, no Asiago, no buffalo mozzarella, just plain mozzarella pizzas. For a restaurant, I would think just a COUPLE options would be necessary. Oh well."}
{"text":"I visited this place yesterday and ended up getting the worst so called beef tenderloin. We ordered greek salad with tenderloin and ended up getting scattered salad with unseen feta cheese. Got 6 flat iron beef which  the restaurant owners call it chunks of beef tenderloin. These 6 tiny pcs would accumulate to 1 piece of Tenderloin which was 20 bucks for a plate.This is an open robbery.  
The tables beside us were also not happy campers.
I would never step in this place again.Name sounds like Italian but were Persian owners. 
Cheap owners."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with an interesting decor.
Staff are friendly.
Food tastes good and feels like it's all fresh.
Their Hummus plate is worth a try.
Honestly, it's a great place to go and have a lovely meal.
Please try it."}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. We were a table of 7 (3 kids) and there were no issues with seating, granted it was a Saturday afternoon. Of the 4 adults, 3 had the pizza and it was very good. They didn't skimp on the cheese, but the dough could have been a little more cooked in the middle (of mine, anyway). The 4th guy had fettuccine alfredo w chicken breast. Wasn't awful but he wasn't turning cartwheels over it either.   

The strangest part of the visit was that the decor was hardcore Greek, but the staff (and possibly owners too) are Korean or Chinese. Very nice, just wasn't expecting it.

I'd go back for the pizza for sure."}
{"text":"Sorrento's is awesome! The hoaggie (steak) sandwich is amazing. It is the best sandwich I have ever had. Their Pizza's are great too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch. They're really good at providing fast service for employees that need to get back to work. Food is really good. Some great pastas and pizzas. They have a lot of unique toppings as well that I havent seen anywhere else. The food is filling and great for its price. Most items are under 20$.

The atmosphere is beautiful. Very euro artsy. Nice decor. Quite spacious so it's very quiet. During the summers you can sit at the patio.

Only downfall is sometimes theyre too rushed. When we were deciding what to eat they kept coming back, atleast 2-3 times every 5 minutes. I also have to remind them twice to give me some extra water."}
{"text":"What is Sorrento? Is it an Italian restaurant? Greek? Pan-Mediterranean? They have pizzas and pastas, lamb shanks and pita sandwiches. Instead of feeling like a unified mediterranean menu, it feels a little like they just couldn't decide so they have a little Greek and a little Italian.

It's a decent place to get a bite to eat. Everything I've had here has been decent. Nothing was terrible, nothing was exceptional. The prices were decent for Toronto, although perhaps a little high given the location and the quality.

Basically, I wouldn't steer you away from Sorrento or recommend it. We've been there a bunch of times from work and we'll undoubtedly go there a bunch more, but it's not a hidden gem. It's just a decent place to get a meal."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this place a 3 and not a 4 or 5 is because of the service. I came here for my birthday with my girlfriends a couple years back and although the food was decent and ambience was really nice, our servers/waiters were really rude. There's a certain amount of tip % you have to pay for groups and they kept reminding us like no tomorrow and they just did not treat us well. Haven't gone back since 4 years ago."}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant was COLD.  Overall this wasn't a good experience.  Even with coats left on it was uncomfortable to sit and the food got cold before we could finish.

We would have appreciated being asked if we wanted more drinks but the server didn't do this and was too far away the whole time to get his attention."}
{"text":"Sorento is a great restaurant if you're looking for good pizza which is reasonably priced. I love the steak pizza and the calamari."}
{"text":"Great parking outside and even better food inside.
Great wood-burning oven pizza. Crust is thin, crispy but not burnt.
Will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Situated on Don Mills in the same plaza as the Congee Star and Swiss Chalet, I will say that between the 3 of the places this is the best if looking for a sit down meal. 
The price points are reasonable, and there is a good selection of options from pasta to sandwiches and burgers to wood oven pizzas to kebab plates and so on. Service was friendly and I did like the decor and the way the room was broken up. They do have a sign out front saying \"Under New Management\", but given this was my first time here I can't say if that's a good thing or not.

I had the Veal Parmagiana Sandwich (around $8 or $9, plus $1.50 for a side of fries), and a both of my other dining compatriots ordered the 9\" Chicken Club Pizza (somewhere around $12 before tax). My sandwich was pretty good, although perhaps could've used a touch more marinara sauce. But the veal was tasty.  I tried a piece of the pizza and it was also quite good but not as good as I was anticipating given the wood oven preparation. We washed the food down with some pints of Moosehead, which to be honest was a bit overpriced as after tax was near $8 for a pint.

In the end we were perfectly satisfied and can't really complain about anything that should persuade someone to not come here. Basically it's a situation that while I won't soon be the person to suggest coming here, if someone were to suggest the place I wouldn't be against it."}
{"text":"Sorento's is home cooking done very well.  Nice basic Greek and Italian dishes, with a few American options (hoagies are very good, even if it's cheap white bread, cheap steak, and cheap cheese... works nicely).  The handful of oddities (curries, mostly) are out of place on the menu, but I'm told they're good... so if they give families more options, I suppose that's a good thing.

My one substantial complaint about Sorento's is that, as a Greek/Italian restaurant, they should know better than to use cheap, canned, sliced black olives.  They have virtually no taste, and it's embarrassing that they'd skimp on such an iconic and essential ingredient.  Yet there they are, crappy canned black olives, scattered over many of the classic dishes on their menu.

Upgrade your olives, and I'll upgrade my review!

A final note:  the prices at Sorento's seem a bit askew.  Some items are extremely inexpensive for what you get, while others seem a tad high... examine the menu and be aware."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but I think it is necessary to do this one. The dining experience and atmosphere is good though the food is tasteless, under seasoned and lacks Italian identity. Pizza came cold and service extreme slow and waiters didn't remember my request. I tasted from most dishes, No dish was near good ... definitely not visiting again or recommending to anyone ... I really regret not to check ratings before visiting, very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times.  The food is fine.  Typically, the pizzas are the better option on the menu.

It can be difficult to get in and out in the space of a lunch hour, so if you're in a hurry, this might not be the best choice.

The parking lot can be chaotic, too, during busy mealtimes and while under construction."}
{"text":"I recently came to tryout this restaurant.  Their food has really changed.  They now have a new owner and the food is really good.  Must try their wood burning thin crust pizza. It's crispy and really good. Love it. The place is packed during lunch. Will definitely come for the pizza.  They are renovating the outside but its still open for business.  They look like they renovated the inside as well. Food is great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I\"ve been here a couple of times because my fiance lives in the hood and recommended this place for me to try out. I was not a huge fan of their soup (mayte that particular one wasn't that great - just raosted pepper), but I LOVE their pizza and their pasta. The prices are quite reasonable and their portions are more than adequate! They also usually have specials for that day for pasta and pizza that isn't on the menu. So far I\"ve tried their meat lasagna, Shrimp Scallop Cacciatore, Fettuccine Pollo Pesto and all of them were tasty, delicious and very good. All their pizza is wood oven, and i've tried traditional, milano, Calabrese and all their dough was nicely done, love the thin crust and they are generous on their toppings. All of the items range from 12-16dollars so it's definitely quite reasonable. I've done both takeout and dine in and the restaurant is very cozy, decoration kinda looks mediterranean. If you're ever in the area and need some good comfort Italian food, this is definitely a place worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"3.5

Went here for dinner on a sunday night with some friends.  Sorento is one of those middle of the road type of places for me.  Nothing done poorly, but nothing that will floor you either.  It's also got curries and Persian food that you won't find at other Italian restaurants. 

Pros:
Variety of dishes to choose from
Prices are very good for some items
Friendly staff

Cons:
No wow factor at all

I came with a group of 8 so I got to see a good variety of dishes Sorento makes.  We had a couple of pastas, a steak sandwich and 2 pizzas ordered between us.  The portions are pretty good here.  The pasta dishes had bigger portions than I'm used to at other Italian restaurants.  The pizzas were a good size, easily share-able for 2 people and the steak sandwich seemed big form what I saw.

I can only review the 2 pastas I and my girlfriend shared.  We had the Linguini ai Fungi and the Fettuccine Pollo Pesto. The Linguini ai Fungi was the better of the two.  The portion was great and the taste pretty good.  They could of given us more sauce though, the noodles seemed barely coated in it.  The pesto dish disappointed us.  My gf and I love pesto too.  There was barely any sauce as well.  The chicken was a tad dry too.  The dish wasn't bad, but there was so much potential for more.  

When the waitress found out we were there the first time, I think she went and told the manager.  He then came out to have a chat with us.  I found that a nice touch.  He came to welcome us and thank us for our patronage.

All in all, this is a nice place to have a good Italian dinner.  I would go back if I'm in the area and craving pasta.  The prices are good and the staff is friendly.  I just won't expect to be wowed by anything."}
{"text":"Sorentos is one of the places on my list of repeats. Especially for work lunches and I have to say everything on the menu is delicious and simple but the quality of the food is definitely worth every penny. Another family run business. The service is great, the servers are attentive, quick and very accommodating. They also have the patio which is nice for the summer with a nice cold drink. They let us pre-order our food because we have an hour for lunch, and our reservation is usually for 8 to 9 people. This place is clean and well lit, you get a Mediterranean feel with the painting on the walls and price is reasonably standard. My favourite quick go-to item here is the Hoggie with fries. I keep forgetting to take a picture as I devour this sandwhich the moment it is placed in front of me. (Its and Italian version of a Philly Cheese steak). This is a must try place if you are in the neighborhood or just passing by..stop in and grab some lunch!"}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch 12.30 p.m on Sunday. We we were the only patrons...never a good sign. During our meal 10 other patrons arrived (2 were children) Only one waiter, and one chef, tending the large pizza oven.
We ordered the lightly breaded calamari starters and the roasted lamb shank as mains. Food was good, prices reasonable. No bread offered or served us, but the table which ordered pizzas was served with an abundance of bread, and presumably butter. 
The decor was something out of the 50's...not hip. It is a large venue, adjacent to other large eateries....maybe the customers went there...
The bill took a long time in coming....longer than it took for the food to arrive...
Really a pity, and deserving of a meh only..."}
{"text":"Eclectic menu combines Italian (pasta/pizza) with Persian (kebabs). Huh? Whatever, I didn't think the owners/staff were Italians so I went with the kebabs (ground beef and chicken). 

I'd say the ground beef was a 4 and the chicken was a 3. Both were tasty, and someone else might give them a higher mark, the taste of the chicken just didn't do anything for me. Salad was very nice (fresh, leafy greens, not just cheapo iceberg lettuce chunks) and the broiled tomato was a really nice touch. Basmati rice was OK but for the price of the meal I would have liked to taste a bit of saffron, not just plain old white Basmati.

I also had a couple of slices of my son's Con Pollo pizza (with chicken, sun dried tomatoes and feta) because my meal wasn't filling enough. The pizza was OK but again, not anything to write home (or to Yelp) about.

Dessert was a shared square of tiramisu -- tasty but it was a tad soggy on the bottom.  Coffee was good and strong, just the way I like it.

I'll come here again for a change of pace, but there are lots of choices in the same plaza so it won't be very often. And there are also better pizza, pasta and Persian kebab options not too far away. Although admittedly, not all in the same place!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place several times on my way in for congee next door and decided to try it for a change.  

Boy am I glad I did because everything I tried was amazing!  The hummus and the salmon Salad with sautéed mushrooms? !  Zomggggg 

I made noises with my mouth while nodding my head with approval with every bite lol. 

I ordered the cheesecake ball for dessert which was just ok.  I guess I was expecting more after such an amazing dinner. 

I returned a second time with my family and all immensely enjoyed their food.  I tried the pasta which was ok but maybe because I'm not much of a pasta person.  For dessert i tried the chocolate mousse which was quite nice with a bitter green tea. 

I'll definitely return again.  

Pricing is decent and I actually like the decor.  It's different like you've stepped into another world"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for take out and it was ready faster than expected.
For the price, 4 pizzas were over $70 dollars and 2 of the 4 were next to inedible.  The crust was both burned and underdone and the chicken on the florentina was not real roasted chicken but the kind you can get precooked in a package.  At 13 15 17 dollars for a pizza we expected better."}
{"text":"A great place to meet and eat. My favourite food choice are the freshly made pizza but there is a good selection of entrees to choose from. I couldn't help but peek at the tables of the other diners, and everything looked delicious. There is a moderate wine selection and a well stocked bar. This restaurant appears to have a loyal clientele and can be quite busy at times.  But why not; good food and drink, attentive service, comfortable surroundings, free parking. It is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"So my friend had an entertainment coupon so we decided to try this place...  They were nice initially until we showed him we had a coupon...We ordered a balsamic pizza and shrimp and scallop spaghetti.  The waiter asked what we wanted to drink and when we told him water, he then told us the coupon won't work unless we both order drinks .  This was clearly false as the coupon does not say this and it was verified by entertainment.com   We didn't want to complain so we ordered pop. We were then neglected for the duration of the meal and given sub par service.  Totally felt the mood change when the coupon was introduced. They never once checked on us.   Anyways. The food came out and it was very average. It reminded me of the type of food you would get at a 4 star all inclusive tropical vacation buffet.  

Pizza - very cheesy which is a good thing if you like cheese.  Did not skimp on cheese. But wasnt crispy and gets soggier as it went towards the middle. 

Spaghetti - portion smaller than i expected 4 jumbo shrimps that tasted very shrimpy, had an ocean water taste like it was not rinsed. Might or might not be a bad thing depending on if you like that. Scallops were over cooked and rubberish.  Overall tasted like home made. Not bad but not the best.  

This restaurant would have gotten 3 out 5.  But the discrimation i felt because we used the coupon killed it.  The food is very homey and subpar i think. If they agreed to have coupons your suppose to honor it with a smile on your face since the point is to have returning customers.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"OK Just went here last night and due ti that 1 star rating less.

The service wasn't as good as last time I was there.  That caused the one star drop.

Also I actually tried the food aside from the pizza.  Pizza is still good, but thumbs down on the food that I tried Chicken and Ground Beef dinner plate.

One more bad service run like that I may have to make this a two star and not bother coming here ever again until someone convinces me otherwise."}
