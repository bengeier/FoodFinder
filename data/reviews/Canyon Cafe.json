{"text":"Gotta respond to Dee M. and her critique of the lady bartender at Sam's Cafe.  I've been served by Amanda about 100 times over the last few years, and never once has she shown me poor customer service or a bad attitude.  She's about the best bartended in Phoenix, so go check her out some time!

As for the restaurant itself, the food is pretty tasty.  Pancho's enchilada's are my staple, but you can't really go wrong with anything there.  Happy Hour is also great - several good food and drink specials.  My favorite drinking place at the AZ Center by far!"}
{"text":"Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try."}
{"text":"To start the service was terrible. Total dining experience took 2.5 hours when it should have taken and hour or hour and a half. Not only did it take forever to get our food ordered, to come out and even longer to get the check when we were more than ready to go. Food was okay however later that night I discovered something was very bad. I got food poisoning from the salmon Caesar salad and was sick for almost a good 24 hours. Bad experience all around."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and only to the Bar Area. 

The bartenders know their drinks and you are offered Chips & Salsa which are warm and amazing. The chips are dusted with some seasoning and you get a chipotle based salsa.
The menu has many options and their table side guacamole is very good and fresh - get it if you can. The only downside is that they cannot make my favorite drink is a Michelada (also known as a Red Beer) and consist of a Mexican beer, lime, spices and Clamato and salted glass . For some reason they don't carry Clamato and I usually order it with a bloody mix instead which is my that great but will do. They also don't have any Hefeweizen at all which is odd but this is the reason for my 4 stars - I'm limited on my favorite drink selections"}
{"text":"Another good meal at Canyon cafe.  The 3 kinds of chips was a great start.  We almost asked for another bowl of the chips.  YUM. My husband and I both had the fish tacos.  Also delicious.  The waitress brought the check with a white chocolate treat.  Nice way to end the meal.  Wish they still had the bison tacos."}
{"text":"Went with my son during a rainy Super Bowl afternoon.  Due to the inclement weather it was pretty dead.

The best part were the chips and salsa and margaritas.  Ordered table side home made guacamole which was very tasty.  

Disappointed with the tacos.  Tacos??? Really, lol.

Fajitas were just, \"ok\".

In my opinion, a great place to go to for margaritas and chips and salsa and that's it."}
{"text":"All the way from the amazing mix of flavored chips and salsa to the meal to the view and service you can't go wrong here! This was by far one of the best meals I've had. I got the salmon and it had a pine nut pesto serve over mashed sweet potatoes with spinach sautéed with candied pecans on top.  Freddie was my server and she was absolutely a charm! Very attentive and sweet as can be! I wished we had a location in the Dallas Texas area, I would be here weekly! They truly know how to please the eye, the mouth and the heart! Job well done Canyon Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Best lunch ever!!! We ate here 4 times while in Phoenix. It was an easy 5 minute walk from the convention center within the shopping/eating center. Get the stuffed pepper (Carnitas Relleno), the tuna, stuffed chicken breast, and/or chicken quesadilla. You won't regret it!! Also, they serve AMAZING chips (thick homemade sweet potato, tortilla, and baked chips) with the best homemade salsa. And the prices can't be beat for what you get!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful but could not eat there because of allergies gluten and soy. Recommended nearby place instead."}
{"text":"Great portions and good food. Stayed for a week near by. Probably ate here 4 times in a week. The southwest Cobb salad is beyond delicious. Great happy hour 4-7 everyday. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went on a random trip to downtown Phoenix and decided to eat lunch at this place.  Be careful of the chips & salsa appetizer- they're bound to get you hooked before the actual meal comes out! I got the salmon flautas which had a fruit salsa topping.  It was greasy and not too flavorful, but the salsa balanced out the greasiness.  My friend had the bbq burger and the black fish tacos, and they enjoyed their dishes as well.  It's not outstanding, but a nice place to eat at with a nice view.  They also gave a peppermint white chocolate tamale dessert for free at the end of my meal! Only thing I didn't like were the birds outside sitting on the tables and pecking at crumbs on the floor!"}
{"text":"The free chips and salsa was great!  It was hard to stop eating the various types of warm chips and chunky, fresh salsa.  The shrimp tacos were delicious! The nice free dessert (banana burrito) from checking in made it a perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place they will definitely see me again. Often! The atmosphere outside was fantastic, noise levels were jovial while we could easily converse without shouting - just right.

The food was amazing. People at two other tables around us exclaimed Wow! When receiving their orders. 

Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great blackened Tilapia!
Almost like the Blackened Mahi I regularly eat at Papadiux. 
Visited this restaurant while attending the Infusionsoft ICON15 Conference. 
It's 2 minutes walking distance from the Convention Center."}
{"text":"This place was interesting, to say the least. 

The location is absolutely beautiful! It's in the Arizona Center and the scenery makes the dining experience so much better. 

The meal: it started off with some tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were something new for me, they had some sort of seasoning on them, but they were good!

I ended up getting the chile-rubbed sirloin with the double mash. The steam itself seemed a little dry, but it was still delicious. The mash potatoes had a similar seasoning as the chips, but seemed to be mixed with sweet potatoes too. I wasn't a fan, this took me by surprise.

The flavors are good, but definitely a little bit different!

Our server, Jennifer, was amazing. She was kind, attentive, and friendly!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful!! I love the huge windows and outdoor patio! Gorgeous! Their food is amazing everything from the chips (there are about 5 different chips in the basket) and salsa to dessert! They have some of the best margaritas in town! Yum! My favorite thing on the menu is the goat cheese stuffed chicken with roaster red pepper sauce! This is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Good place. Not the most exciting food, but solid quality. The table-side fresh guacamole was a knockout!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed eating at Sam's (now Canyon) from when they had their Biltmore location...the Pancho's Enchiladas are my favorite! However I went to their downtown location with my 4 month old daughter today to meet some friends for lunch and they do NOT have a diaper changing station in their restroom. Was pretty disappointed and won't be returning if it is a family meal."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Complimentary and yummy chips and salsa.  Good price on my favorite dish...the black and blue quesadilla.  Plus, there is always at least one beer worth drinking at happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"We had several of their specials in our group and they were all fabulous!!  Our server was incredible and service was great!! Going back before we leave one more time!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of work associates while staying across the street for a conference. Service was very good - our waiter handled the large group with ease, which doesn't always happen.

The chips and salsa are unlike any I've had anywhere else and they were totally addictive! My end of the table demolished our bowl in minutes and then grabbed the one from the other end. 

The entrees left a bit to be desired, however. Lots of seafood - which just doesn't seem right in the desert. I would have liked more traditionally tex-mex dishes to choose from as I eventually settled on the enchilada and carnitas platter, which was OK. 

All things considered, it was a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back next time business brings me to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went to Sam's Cafe with my boyfriend last week, & it was amazing. Great happy hour prices & THE BEST margaritas of my life. For $2. 

Our waitress was extremely attentive, always refilling our waters, chips, margaritas. My chicken tacos were incredible! And he loved the shrimp tacos so much that we actually ate at Sam's twice more before returning home to Oregon. 

In a state known for its southwestern dishes, Sam's Cafe sets the bar high for Tex-Mex cuisine."}
{"text":"I love this place and have eaten her more times than I can count.  Anything with their green chili pork is fantastic.  The steak and blue cheese quesadilla is amazing.  As several others haven mentioned the chips and salsa are quite tasty."}
{"text":"This is my second review of the Canyon Café; the first was the result of a very disappointing visit earlier this month due to their service.  I reviewed on Trip Advisor and Yelp and asked the management to please read the many reviews online about their horrible service and take notice.  They DID!

Not only did I receive a response to my posting from the Manager, but I was invited to make a return visit.  His response was not defensive or full of excuses but a sincere desire to make things right, which I appreciated.  I will admit to sending two other friends down there to see how they were treated after I received the Manager's reply saying they had made some changes.  They each told me the service was very good so I replied to the Manager with my number and said we would be giving them a return visit for our wedding Anniversary.

When I received the call from them to make my reservation, Laura was very informed of my review and said it made her shudder when she realized what had happened.  I was surprised that she knew the details but apparently, everyone - from the Manager on Duty, Steven, to chef Thomas to waitress Cheryl - all were well informed!  Cheryl thanked us for making them aware of the problem and said they had made some changes to assure their customers didn't leave unhappy any longer.  Thomas - who'd had no part in the problems before - shared his passion for the restaurant and made a good case for how they are a family there and all care about the restaurant's being well perceived by the public.  

Our experience there was delightful!  The food was the expected excellence we've always enjoyed and the service was exemplary!  Thank you, Cheryl!  We received a lot of personal attention but noticed that the other diners were given the same.  This is what we wanted to see because as long time customers, we didn't want people to turn away from them and see them go into a decline like so many restaurants.

Hats off to Canyon Café for listening to their customers and making the necessary changes to assure a great dining experience.  All done with a great attitude, too!  So please count on our continued return for many more enjoyable visits at the Canyon Café!  Nice job!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here at the end of a long week of conference meetings. Compared to the fast food, food court, and hotel fare I'd eaten throughout the week before, this was a fabulous meal. Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it.

Primary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish.

Positives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish. 

Service-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome."}
{"text":"What a great menu and patio... The commemorativo margarita is great..."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was just okay. Nothing super great, I had the special- it was some kind of tenderloin but it was dry. Good margaritas!"}
{"text":"The food was very innovative and delicious. I ordered stuffed chicken that had goat cheese in it. The nachos were also delicious with the salsa. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The chips were different than I've ever had. They had different spices on them which were delicious. We also had the roasted artichoke queso dip which was amazing. I also had the street tacos which were delicious. The service on the other hand was a different story. Our waitress Denise M was so rude. I had to ask multiple times to get my water refilled and she was rushing us with ordering and the check. Very disappointed in the service but the food was delicious. If you decide to try this restaurant out hopefully you get a different server because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great flavor, reasonable prices and good service. Enjoyed happy hour margaritas and a delicious carnitas plate. Salsa and chips were surprisingly different. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my son.  So we buzzed into this neat little complex.  Found the restaurant and sat outside watching the nursing students go by.  I ordered a house special margarita, that they will only sell two of to you.  The drink was made out of fresh juices and a healthy pour of tequila. Wow it was delicious. 

A unique basket of chips was dropped off at out table.  Different kinds of chips with a great spice on them and what appeared to be a restaurant made salsa.  Absolutely delicious.  Really, fantastic flavors in a great combination. 

Had a chimichangas for my meal.  It was really good as well.  Crunchy outside with a real intense flavored chicken inside.

I will without a doubt return next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Staff was rude and obnoxious. Also, they close very early no matter what their hours say. Never going back in there."}
{"text":"Don't often leave 1-star reviews but have no choice with this one. We went on a friends recommendation who went a day earlier, they had a great time but our experience was completely opposite.

The chips and guacamole were awesome but everything went sharply downhill after that. We waited about 45 minutes for our food (after finally complaining to the waitress and getting an eyeroll our food came out immediately). The food was mainly cold and the steak fajitas were rubbery. We all ate about half our plates and decided it was time for the check.

The restaurant was empty and waitress was nowhere to be seen for most of the night. Oh well."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix for work a lot and this is always a place my co-workers and I come to when we're in town.  There's really nice outdoor seating with some misters to cool you down on a hot summer day. 

They always provide you with chips and salsa which are AH-MAY-ZING.  It's not your typical tortilla chips and salsa there's something extra special about these chips.  

It's your standard tex-mex cuisine.  I really like their shrimp taco's.  The carnitas platter was pretty good but the pork was a bit too salty for me.  Their fajitas are always good.  The salmon is also pretty good.  Those are the typical dishes I get when I go.  

When you end the meal they always give you white chocolate tamales to clean/cool your palate.  Always delish. ...

The place hasn't really disappointed me except for this past week when we purchased two pitchers of the Grand Canyon margaritas and there was more juice than there was tequila.  :-\  but other than that it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered the stuffed chicken breast with goat cheese.I believe it was the Santa fe. It was absolutely amazing and delicious. The chips and salsa were a great taste prior to the main course."}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe at Arizona Center is a relaxed restaurant good for dinner or a weekend lunch. I've been underwhelmed by an entree or two (note: don't bother with the steak), but in general, the food is good. The margaritas are large and potent. They have a small but good selection of beers on tap. The chips and salsa are good. I enjoy their quesadillas and burgers. The patio is a great place to have a lazy Saturday afternoon drink with friends.

While I like Sam's Cafe well enough, I know some people who absolutely love it, so I can confidently say it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Canyon Cafe was fantastic. We started with their awesome chips and table side Guac, which was very fresh. Then I had shrimp tacos. The lightly-breaded shrimp were bathed in a sweetish-spicy remoulade and topped with \"margarita coleslaw,\" which was light and citrus-y. I savored every bite. Finished lunch with white chocolate tamales. We're only in town for a few days, but we'll probably even eat at Canyon Cafe again on this trip."}
{"text":"Our server was a little slow BUT, she was really nice and very helpful.  Our meal was excellent starting with their chip bowl that had a variety of chips in it and good salsa.  The meal was also really good.  I got the seafood flautas.  I would've finished it had I not filled myself up on the chip bowl.  They also bring out complimentary white chocolate tamales that tasted really good!  If they do that for all their customers, I can see why everyone comes back."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a conference at the convention center.  No car, extreme heat, dead downtown.  This was across the street and one of two Mexican places in the area.  Had the naked chile relleno and the max limit (?) of two margaritas.  Chips and salsa were very good and different.  I suspect they used dried chiles.  The relleno was great.  Meat was tender, mushrooms and other veggies very flavorful.  Can't imagine why they feel a need to \"limit\" customers to two, but it was good.  Service was brusque but quick."}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix for a convention, give this place a try. I took a group of 10 clients...they loved it. Nice southwest atmosphere, food was great! Service was great! For 10 people with drinks and a few deserts came out to $27 per person with the tip. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa. Never tried because it never came. Waited in hour at my table just to walk away. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant serving southwest menu. Lots of choices - you will have trouble deciding. Great margaritas - gotta try the Limit 2. Once you have one - you will understand its name! 

Service is excellent - never an empty water or ice tea glass! The tea is fresh brewed. We ordered all over the menu - several favorites - Fish Tacos and Crispy Shrimp Tacos were outstanding. Both cooked perfectly - the slaw is off the charts. 

The pork dishes are incredible. Location is a little challenging to find - in the middle of a small corner shopping plaza - across the street from the Sheraton. Two blocks from the Convention Center. 

Salsa is so fresh the tomatoes are still ripening in the bowl! Nice smoky flavor to salsa - also the chips are seasoned - really different and delish!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!

The chips and salsa are fantastic, I couldn't stop eating them.  The food was excellent, the service was prompt and friendly, and even the desert was delicious (tres leches)!

We went on a Friday night and were one of the only ones in the restaurant, which surprised me.  We also ordered a margarita (one of the ones large enough to share) and it was perfectly prepared.

I look forward to coming here again and highly recommend giving it a shot if you haven't yet.  The free dessert Yelp coupon alone makes it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"This is actually one of favorite restaurants ever, been coming since 1999 and they've only gotten better over the years, Guys: great first-date place!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic southwest food! You want something fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced go to Canyon Cafe! The canyon classic burger is perfect! Cheddar jalapeño bun can't be beat!! Guacamole made to order right in front of you! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Here at Sheraton and walked over for dinner. Ordered Pablo's enchiladas (2 orders) and a spinach and mushroom quesadilla. 
Negative: All was originally served room temperature at best...came to us within 5 minutes of original order and we were told it was \"cooked to order.\" Server was okay...he did return the original plates to kitchen and bring out somewhat fresher food...microwave warm. Service is slow at best. 
Positive: ambiance was nice. Server was kind enough re: our complaints of stale/rewarded food. Sauce on enchiladas (which is what this restaurant is apparently known for) was tasty. 
Overall: I would not return. Too many options for southwestern food nearby. The restaurant was busy (not overly, but steady) during our visit which would suggest food was being freshly prepared...which is certainly was not."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation, but after a long day of sightseeing, if you want to just sit down and get some Mexican and a few coronas without having to go back to the hotel and shower and get dressed up, this place will do."}
{"text":"Two! Not one,  but two roaches crawling on the table. Came in, sat and ordered then here comes a Roach crawling on the table then another! Not sure if the solar flares, the full moon, or the fact that it's Friday the 13th had anything to do with it,  but the fact that it was my first time there, the roaches made it my last time there! And the fact that the booth seating with the huge square pillars makes for an uncomfortable setting. And the energy is not good,  very off! Also, the roaches were small, meaning there are more, probably a nest! Roaches don't come out during the day unless there's an infestation! Wouldn't recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Went in about 430pm folks were friendly service was prompt. I had the chicken enchiladas, my friend had the Canyon Carnita Relleno. They were both outstanding. The chips and salsa were great. We travel for a living and have sampled several Mexican restaurants over the years, this one is certainly in the top 10%. Enchiladas came with a nice green salad. Service was excellent. I will definitely return. This is a slightly different take on Mexican food, not you usual bland fare."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency recommended us to go here for some great Mexican food and that we had - along with some great 2-limit margaritas! Our server Frederica was so great! We told her about how we were going to drive all over the state and site see in the days to come, we pulled out a map and she gave us the best routes to drive, best scenic views, she said if we needed more information she'd call her dad and we could ask him questions. I'm glad we had her as a server and we're so glad we listened to her advice!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times because of the good food. Yesterday I had tuna with rice, vegetables and avocado. The food was yummy and the waitress was excellent. When I checked in on yelp I noticed the free desert with an entree promo. How exciting for somebody who LOVES sweets. I ordered a cheesecake with caramel sauce to go. Very disappointed to say, the cake was old!!!I tried a few bites to give it another try but just couldn't do it. Changing my rating to 3 stars. I realize that the dessert was free, but that is not the reason to serve somebody an old product...."}
{"text":"So we came here for drinks after work, and the sign says \"half price Margaritas.\" After we order the first round we find out the happy hour is only if you order drinks from the bar. Really? That first round was really weak, by the way. After bringing this to the waiter's attention, he \"checked\" with his manager and gave us the happy hour price. Needless to say, we didn't order any more drinks from him and he made himself scarce. Would have ordered food, if he came back and checked on us. Ever. Gave two stars because he bumped down the price (as he should) and the chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"We were a group of 23 for dinner our poor waiter had no help. We were served a round of drinks and it was an hour after before we were asked to place our orders. The food was terrible!"}
{"text":"Giving a one star is very generous. Ate there last night for one reason, the fabulous location. To start off there was a 45 minute wait and the restaurant was half empty, that was the first sign something was not right. Second sign, the most rude bartender on the face of the earth and we still stuck it out. Finally got to our table and the bad adventure begun. To start off, the tortilla chips were just covered with salt and seasoning spice, you have to clean them off, one at a time. The salsa is nothing but tostitos southwest sauce they've sold for years, just garbage. As for the service, after the 6th time the waitress telling you your food will be right out and 1 hour and 10 minutes gone by, who really wanted to eat ? We should have walked out and headed to Taco Bell for a better meal, enough said. As for the Superbowl visitors, I'm from Phoenix this is a no go, don't ruin your night....................."}
{"text":"How good is Sam's? Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is. 

I'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! 

Let me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.

Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.

Let me stop right here.

I knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!

Once we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.

For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.

Words cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.

I'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!
 
At the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. 

While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever seen. We waited for a half hour before grabbing a waitress."}
{"text":"This is a decent place. I came here some time ago because I had a Restaurant.com certificate, and the BF and I needed to use it up. 

The best part were the margaritas- tasty and lethal. I can't remember what I got, only that it had coconut in it. It shouldn't have worked, but it did! 

The food itself was... so-so. It was edible, nothing to write home about. The service was good, and the ambience lovely. We went in the fall and sat on the patio.

I wouldn't come out of my way to dine here, but if you were in the neighborhood during happy hour, it's definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times once for dinner and a couple of times for happy hour. And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.

The food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better

The best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. 

Another good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. 

I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a lovely lunch experience!  I had a carnitas-stuffed breaded pepper with a rich, creamy sauce...was almost sad when the meal ended. A complimentary small dessert of white chocolate-stuffed corn husks was a very nice surprise. I was too full to \"unlock\" the dessert listed here on Yelp and, so my friendly server, Cheryl, suggested I come back for it later - I think I'll take her up on that offer, because Happy Hour looks great!  :-)"}
{"text":"Great ambience of fun, somewhat outdoor seating, water play and a cocktails. Chips and salsa was very good. The wait staff was very friendly and accomodating. We experienced as a couple and a large group, both times were amazingly friendly. Dining experience was great, food is good, however skip the calamari as it was cut thicker and chewy. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to eat here every week, but got tired of overcooked steaks. Thought I would give them another chance tonight but sorry I did. After braving the construction that is the AZ center, had another overcooked steak. Ordered MR & it came out Med to MW. Service at the bar also sucked. Never asked how the food was (after sending out the wrong sides) and never offered to refill my drink.  Probably not going to return after this experience."}
{"text":"Margaritas were awesome! I ordered the crispy shrimp street taco platter and at first glance it wasn't what I expected however they turned out great! I will definitely be returning and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is not only great but beautifully presented! The staff and management (Tony) work hard to ensure customers are having a great experience. The construction downtown makes it tricky to get to restaurant, but it's well worth it. Their happy hour (4-6:00) drinks and appetizers are a great value and tasty."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 starts! I had a reservation there and when I walked in, there were about 20 other people waiting around the hostess stand. I walked up and said my name and what time my reservation was and the hostess said \"yeah, he said that I can't seat anyone right now.\" I explained that I had a reservation, and was told that the other 20 people also had reservations, but \"he said I can't seat anyone and I don't know when I will be allowed to seat.\" Now usually I'm okay with waiting, but the way that she said it irritated me - I have a background in the service industry and the first rule is to not put blame on another person - manager, servers, cooks, anyone! She could have said \"unfortunately we aren't seating right now but once I know more I will let you know!\"

Anyway, we went to the bar to see if we could at least get a drink while we waited. We're sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting.... No acknowledgement or greeting from the bartenders. The only time we are acknowledged is when he says \"chips?\" We said no, we'd like some drinks, but he never got back to us. And the bar wasn't even busy!! While waiting there, I see the hostess seat two tables so I go up to her to see if they're seating now. She says, \"well they're find with sitting and snacking on chips - are you? Because I don't have a server for you.\" Wow. How nice. No, we have a movie to catch and don't want to sit around and wait when you can get a server.

Basically, it was one of the worst experiences I've had - no table after we made a reservation, no acknowledgement at the bar, and no servers able to take us. Very impressed... not!"}
{"text":"The struggle to find decent food and service in the #phx area was among one of my biggest struggles. The bartender was a bit brash at first and I felt rushed to make a decision on food & drink within a minute or two of sitting down. I ordered the wings and a coyote margarita. The wings were ok, pretty greasy & nothing spectacular. The margarita was good. When you arrive they give you complimentary chips and salsa. Don't get excited about it, because the chips were covered in heavy seasoning and salsa was very thick, smoky & heavy with adobo. After my appetizer and feelings about the chips and salsa, I didn't trust the place to deliver a decent meal. I had dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, vibe, and had the best waitress ever!

The meal starts off with a free basket of chips+salsa. The salsa was different than you would expect to get normally. It wasn't spicy, but was actually super dark red, and it was served cold, which was great! Pair it with the assortment of chips they provide, and you could easily fill yourself up! You could tell they were homemade chips--a blue tortilla, normal corn tortilla with seasoning, and then a thicker sweeter churro-esque chip (which was my favorite).

The margaritas were delicious and were pretty strong without the taste of alcohol (major plus). Maybe it's because my alcohol tolerance has decreased significantly in the past few years, but after drinking 1/3 of it, I was hit with a surprising, pleasant buzz. I got the frozen mango margarita and my friend got the frozen raspberry one. 

We also ordered the table-made guac (where they have all the ingredients ready and bring it to your table side to mash it up in front of your eyes). It tasted good, just very ordinary as you would make it yourself at home. Nothing too special--wouldn't order it again.

I ordered the blackened tilapia with crawfish since it was something different than eating the normal Cajun crawfish. It had great flavors..unfortunately I was already full from the chips+salsa and guac.

All in all, the delicious food combo'd with the amazing service would have me definitely coming back on any future trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really good margaritas but food is not that great. We have brought several friends on the weekend though because the environment can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat, but there are a few issues. The food is fresh and tasty (though neither authentic nor flavor rich). The premium margarita is excellent and the chips are a nice mix of fresh spicy styles. This is my third visit and I enjoyed the carnitas and enchilda platter. The enchiladas were great and had an unusual white sauce that really made the meal. The carnitas was well prepared, but a little fatty for my taste.  

As others have said, uneven service remains a challenge. The staff works hard, is friendly and trys to be attentive, but somehow come up just a bit short. Remembering details like split checks or dessert requests seem too much. If you have time to linger and people watch, none of this will be a problem. They seem to cater to conference visitors and folks coming downtown for the day. This may be your best option in the area. 

A final thought. While the desserts are not spectacular, they are good. The banana burrito stands our from the rest. It is tasty, a bit like bananas foster in a fried tortilla, but the use of Hershey's syrup leaves the experience falling short. And that summarizes the entire experience. Good for an area where you wouldn't expect good, but still short of what it might be."}
{"text":"Food was great, SW Cobb salad is amazing but the service was horrible. First the hostess sat me at the farthest end of the restaurant away from the few patrons that were there. Order was quickly taken and drinks and chips delivered very quickly, even the food came relatively fast but after that one person came by in the next 25 minutes to refill water until the waitress showed up and brought me my bill. $15 salad, I can get that somewhere else with much better service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by the hotel we were staying at.  Very disappointing .  Poor service, we actually had to get our menus ourselves.  Drinks were wrong after ordering- they were however corrected.  Food orders were messed up, arrived nearly 45 minutes later, all were cold, some were not even cooked all the way through.  We even had to return the chicken salad twice as it was made wrong, nothing special about it just didn't want dressing.  No one ever came to check on us, no one apologized, nothing was comp'ed.  The young ladies at the hostess stand were not very helpful either to our waitress who was clearly trying her best but over her head.  Not a good experience - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I treated my mom and aunt to lunch. The restaurant was pretty empty but we were advised that the restaurant was booked from 4pm until close. That would've been an acceptable response if it wasn't 2 in the afternoon. We were told we could sit at the bar ( 6-8 people were already seated and being obnoxiously loud) or at the bar tables ( which were filled with plates and glasses from the last patrons). The hostess and manager ( assuming) seemed annoyed by the fact that we asked why we couldn't sit at the plethora of empty tables, to clean the tables around the bar and explanation as to why no one wanted to help. Visiting with a convention and being treated the way we were makes me EXTREMELY unhappy and wouldn't recommend anyone visit this establishment. 
The only saving grace is Sal. He was super helpful."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here never disappoint ! 
Chips and salsa are the reason why we go. No place in the valley that has chips like these. There is a margarita that they only serve you no more than two that is soooo sooo sooo good, and they are right on the no more than two! Service is always friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the place has gone down hill since the last time I was here. Booth seats not clean and worn out. Bathroom not so clean... ugh. 
Go for the food, look past the other stuff :) 
Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about a undiscovered gem. My husband and I frequent the movie theater here often and today I just had to have something to eat. Originally we were going around the corner to My big Fat Greek restaurant and I realized it was closed. My husband insisted we keep walking and we walked right into this place . Happy hour 7 days a week the bartender was just the sweetest woman giving us recommendations and answering all our questions. I will definitely be hungry next time we see a movie ;)

I highly recommend the Grand Canyon margarita and wings!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group of 11. The service was great, the food was okay. I had the blackened fish tacos and the flavor was good, but it was nothing more than fish in a tortilla, nothing special. My favorite thing about this restaurant was the basket of chips they put on your table. They had everything from regular tortilla, deep fried, sweet pototao and blue corn chips. The margaritas were great too. I'd go back again because they do have a great outdoor patio, but the food is nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Great food.  We went with a large party and got great service.  Margaritas were very strong, so beware of how much you consume!  Fortunately, I wasn't driving and the metro is a short walk.  I could have made a meal of the chips and dip.  They had some sort of special seasoning that I couldn't quite place, but I loved them and ate way too many.  We sat outdoors and the weather was great."}
{"text":"I wish there was one of these in Atlanta!!Amazing food & drinks!  I had the Rico Rita (margarita made with rum) and it was awesome!!!  Then we did table side guacamole and it was fabulous!!! I loved their \"chips\" and salsa!  I had the street tacos (shrimp and carnitas) and they were delish.  They brought out some yummy white chocolate dessert too. 
My suggestion - sit outside & listen to the fountains!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Queso dip and black and blue quesadilla were delightful. Highly recommend. For happy hour, you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!"}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed from the food to the service the food was barely edible. the service was slow waitress did not know the menu or the ingredients. We ordered the  top shelf margarita we split it, it was nothing to write home about. The only thing on my plate that was absolutely good was the grilled vegetables they were crunchy and seasoned well. The talipia was bland and saturated with oil is very greasy yuck! 
The have a beautiful  view of the courtyard with lights."}
{"text":"If you're gonna eat tex-mex in the downtown phoenix area, this is your best bet. 

I typically go here every time I come to Phoenix, and it's pretty great. the outdoor seating with the Grotto view is really really gorgeous. 

The chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!!!! You get an assortment of chips and they are the best I've ever had. 

The blackened fish tacos set my mouth on FIRE. I had no idea they would be COVERED in chili powder. too extreme for me. 

Typically you get, white chocolate wrapped in a tamale leaf to cleanse your pallet after you are finish with your meal, which is one of my favorite parts of dinner ... but our waitress forgot :( ... definitely ask! 

I would say this is your typical \"mexican/southwest\" restaurant, where the entire menu is basically variations of taco salad, 10 different variations of quesadillas, and tacos of some sort, and 3 pages of different margaritas and drinks with \"loco\" in the name. 

Not too bad, not great either. I personally prefer the Greek place next door :)"}
{"text":"Visited Sam's Cafe on the Urban Wine Walk. I recommend the white sangria!"}
{"text":"Wow...what a nice surprise!  Chips and salsa were great, even though I usually prefer my salsa spicier than what is offered. Desert Fire Pasta was EXCELLENT, and sons loved their pork enchiladas and chicken quesadillas. Limit Two margarita was awesome (Top Shelf Conmemorativo).   Highly recommended - great food, reasonably priced, and outdoor seating wonderful!"}
{"text":"I dined here three times in one month, each time with different groups. We all enjoyed the experience. The chips are made fresh on site and believe me, you can tell! 

Lots of outdoor seating right there by the palm trees and water fountains at Arizona Center. There are usually a few birds squawking and chirping in the background as well. No charge for this entertainment. 

Tried several dishes (NOT all in one sitting!), including tacos and enchiladas. All excellent. 

Full bar and indoor seating as well if desired. Friendly staff each visit. 

And here's a nice touch: they give out these corn husk-wrapped white chocolates as complimentary dessert. Make sure you unwrap those husks or you'll be in for a nasty surprise. 

The goods are on the inside. Not the outside. 

But on the inside? Savory, cool white chocolate. It tastes a bit like butter pecan ice cream (if anyone can even remember that flavor, which seems to have gone the way of vinyl albums and phone booths). 

Check out the Canyon Cafe. I believe you'll also become a fan."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I only ordered table side guacamole and a cheese quesadilla.  The chips were amazing and I thought the salsa was just okay.  Quesadilla was good. Service was slow but that was okay cuz I was there to enjoy a beautiful morning in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here for dinner on a Sunday night. The service is great! Our server gave great recommendation for food and drinks. I had the carnitas chile relleno and my guy had the chicken flautas that were both featured items. There are both tortilla and sweet potato chips with a delicious roasted salsa.  Just wished they did not require to pay for garage parking on the weekends downtown to hopefully bring more people to the center. If this restaurant was closer to my house I would go once a week."}
{"text":"Only gave three stars because the hostess would not seat us on the patio.
We were only there for drinks
I do say the margaritas were wonderful.
We ordered a pitcher and it was plenty for four, chips and salsa were delish.
Would definitely like to come back for food."}
{"text":"Great location. Food good. Came here on a Monday night about 10 minutes before closing and they accommodated us. Service was pretty quick and good. Outdoor seating available.

We ordered margaritas which were delicious. They bring the entire mixer, so you get about 1.5 - 2 glasses once you're finished drinking it.

We had the fish tacos and Avodo chicken pasta. Both tasted good and were cooked just right. Portions were fairly sizable. 

Dining space is fairly large and is good for groups."}
{"text":"Wow,  atmosphere and good food ! Amazing service.  The Pecan Salmon was out of this world,  and Open faced Chile was way killer.!"}
{"text":"Omg this is a hidden gem
Great food and service 
Tony the manager and tonya the server was great
I ordered the black and blue quesadilla lots of stake and great flavor
My partner ordered the applewood salmon is was to die for
And the margaritas have a great taste and are potent lol 
Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Canyon Cafe is in the top five of favorite places to eat. My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon Cafe.  

Pro: The chips and salsa rock my world! The entree's are delicious! The staff is friendly and efficient.  The ambiance is quiet and relaxed.

Con: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.

Canyon Cafe exceeds our expectations every time.  You go for dinner but you stay for the chips and salsa.  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and regular tortilla chips.  The salsa is roasted and heavenly.  

Recommended: The bison burger, it is juicy and flavorful. The Verde Chicken enchiladas, love the sauce and chicken is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.

Can't wait to go back.  It's our little secret place that we enjoy because it's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric."}
{"text":"Here on business, staying at the downtown sheraton across the street from the restaurant. I've been here twice this week and the food and service have been great. Chips and salsa are a unique blend of sweet and salty and delicious. Great margaritas. Both I can only comment on the fajitas but they are amazing. I'd definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Best Fajitas I've had!  Service was fast and friendly.  There was enough food easily for 2! The mall is under construction but it's worth the walk."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a long day at the convention center. The tableside prepared guacamole was awesome as was the Chipotle salsa and variety of chips delivered to the table. The service was attentive but not annoying. Two of us had the naked relleno, one had flautas,  one had carnitas and another the corn chowder.  Everyone loved their meals that came out hot and nicely seasoned. Being from Colorado were really picky about our Mexican food so this was quite a treat."}
{"text":"This is a good stop for travelers to grab cheap food and enjoy some drinks.  

They start off with a nice helping of chips and salsa.  The chips were an assortment of corn, fried dough like, and whole grain chips.  The salsa was nice and spicy, a great start.  We also ordered guacamole which was creamy and oniony.   

We came at the time the servers switched off and areas, so we had 3 different servers, but after we had our final server, he was courteous and took care of us.

I had the desert fire pasta which was a big helping of spicy, cheesy penne pasta with shrimp.  It was really salty but still thought it was still good overall.

My co-worker had the fish tacos which was a nice large platter with black beans.  The sangria was delicious and you could have a choice of white or red."}
{"text":"No real complaints about this place - last time I was here, I was fairly pleased overall.  Chips and salsa were a treat, possibly only because I was really hungry.  Pretty good margarita, as well.  I guess the reason this place doesn't get more stars is the food - while not bad, it doesn't stand out much.  I've never had any problems with the service here, though I've never been really impressed by it either.

Eat on the patio - it's not a great patio, but it has a decent view of the Arizona Center's plaza."}
{"text":"Stood for 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us.  Finally hostess greets us and first thing she states is sorry you will have to wait.  Half the restaurant is open!  Bad first impression"}
{"text":"This place has so much promise, I need to come back and try it again!  The chips and salsa are spectacular.  The service was quite slow, but the restaurant was also quite busy.  It still took an hour and 15min and all I ordered was a salad.  Don't get the Calamari Salad if it is on special.  I should have known better than to get that at a TexMex restaurant, but lesson learned.  The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.  

Long story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.  I saw plates of tacos go by that looked and smelled much better than what I was mulling through.  The waitress felt bad though, she could tell I was not enjoying my meal.  As a consolation prize I was hooked up with a delicious white chocolate tamale when I got my bill.  I will be back, I will choose more wisely, and hopefully things will be better!"}
{"text":"A decent place for a businessman's lunch or a post-work Happy Hour for margaritas in the Arizona Center, but the food is a hit or miss, the servers are pretentious hipsters who could care less about their customers, and it's overpriced for very average Tex-Mex food in a city that has plenty of better Mexican food options. Good chips and salsa, but nothing else stands out."}
{"text":"I took a group of people here from work -  The service was outstanding the food was even better. I produced my \"Yelp\" coupon and it was honoured without question. The chips and salsa really get your attention, and some of the cocktails were excellent. They seated our group of 8 immediately, even while they had a large function going on outside. All who ate there were thrilled."}
{"text":"Bomb.com. Try the fajitas or enchiladas. It's enchanting. Check in for free dessert. Shout out to my girl Brent for hooking it up with to go chips n salsa."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and taste of the food.  I had an amazing waiter and the manager was even walking around asking how everyone's meals came out.  

I loved the chips and salsa.  There was a mix of different colored chips with different seasonings.  I ordered steak fajitas which came out hot, tender and delicious.  A lot of veggies and a lot of nice spices.  I ordered a slide of dulche De Leche, which was so good.  

My bill, with a 30% tip only came out to $20, which I thought was very reasonable.

The restaurant is located in a nice little plaza area with a cool looking courtyard, surrounded by an office building and a sweet looking Cathedral, a few blocks from Chace field.  I was glad I went here."}
{"text":"Long wait with super rude host.  Directed us to the bar and after being ignored for 20 minutes was told we would just have to wait until bartender would get to us.  Had to go up to bat individually to order our food and definitely knew we were putting him out.  Food ok."}
{"text":"Not bad place in downtown. Chips and salsa were good. Got two a la carte tacos...tempura fish and chicken. They were tasty. Happy Hour margs are a good price."}
{"text":"Great complimentary house made chips and salsa and the limit 2 margarita is the best I've had in awhile. Our server was very helpful and she did a great job given the busy night. The wait was a little long but the food and service was awesome and will definitely bring me back here!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Canyon Cafe. Atmosphere was quiet with southwestern decorating. Food was great! A really cool mixed chips with flavoring to start, fajitas with great presentation and took advantage of the free dessert promo when you check in on yelp. The waitress was standout, she actually asked about our timeline! We had time to relax tonight and we weren't in a hurry but there are so many times when we are and they don't bother to ask. I would definitely recommend. The only reason it wasn't 5/5 was my fajitas were super wet, and rice was soaked in sauce."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least 7 times in one week while visiting in Phoenix including lunch and dinner. Everything we tried was wonderful. We had salmon, tacos, fajitas,chimichanga  and salads. The deserts are especially good. Be sure to try their award winning Margaritas"}
{"text":"Our prime reason for eating here was that it was directly across from the Sheraton and after a long flight, we were starving! We had a a decent sized group, around 10, and all of us were pleased with our meals!

I wish there had been a few more vegetarian options but was pleased with my selection of SPINACH & PORTABELLA MUSHROOM QUESADILLA. It had a perfect smoky taste. Not too cheesy or vegetably. A perfect balance in my opinion.

I would say the winners of our trips there were:

#1 The chips and salsa. The free chip basket seemed never ending and there were three different kinds of homemade  tortilla chips in each basket. The salsa had a nice chipotle kick and I filled up more than I intended to with the chips and salsa!

#2 Their infamous, \"limit 2\" margaritas. While I didn't have them myself, several people in my group did. They said they were strong and delicious and definitely did the job of getting the fiesta started!

If I'm ever in the downtown Phoenix area again, I'd stop by Canyon Cafe next time when they are having their Queso Bar. Sounds delicious."}
{"text":"Great TexMex/Southwestern food located in the Arizona center! Chips&Salsa, table side guac, margaritas, white chocolate pecan \"tamales\" and superb service made our last meal here in Phoenix a memorable one! 

SERVICE was excellent from everyone here. The hostess, server, and manager were great. In general, we felt everyone in AZ was friendly and this place was no exception. I had a few questions after seeing their menu and they were happy to answer them. My first two questions came after reading their sign at the front door:
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#5bkxBk1xbLz1lfpCt1slkA

WHAT?!? LIMIT 2 MARGARITAS?! I never heard of this!! Our server explained that each margarita order is actually 2 glasses full, each glass has 2oz of alcohol so they limit you to 2 orders = 4 glasses = 8oz of tequila. I guess it's true, 1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, floor. Recommend!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#9CoBAf2lHDm-VuDInPyyqA
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#0EvNrLfD3apsqZt0tNaaBQ

CHIPS and SALSA! This is not your ordinary chips and salsa! Like everyone else says, these are great! The salsa is awesome by itself and the 4 different types of chips - wonton, sweet potato,  blue&white corn tortilla (some of which were dusted with some magic sweet/salty/spicy rub) just hit the spot. Awesomely recommend.

TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE! Holy guacamole! They explain all the ingredients that go into their guacamole to make sure everyone is ok with them and then proceed to make the freshest and best guac...take notes because this stuff is good! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#iye-PBk09GNJJhpwsGFq5w

The dinner entrees were just okay. Nothing special going on there. But by this time you are wasted from the the two margaritas so it doesn't really matter. 

CHECK-IN on YELP, get free dessert! The white chocolate pecan tamales that arrived at our table were great, and this banana burrito was the free check-in offer!!

I'm not gonna argue whether this place is authentic or not. I'm no expert. However, this place has stood the test of time, as we've visited this place multiple times over the past 10+yrs whenever we are in Phoenix because we like it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner for our anniversary after a baseball game and to our surprise, mostly everything was amazing! His adova rib eye was cooked just right and had succulent flavors to the dry last bite. My adova penne chicken pasta wasn't far behind! Not to mention the chocolate chip and pecan complimentary tamale was totally different than the traditional tamales we're accustomed to yet scrumptious! I would have gave this restaurant, formerly Sam's cafe, 5 stars but the guacamole was too lemony and our service was pretty slow at the beginning despite seeing tons of staff pass us on by, but once the manager took notice everything changed! Definitely coming back next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were excellent. My wife loved the chicken avacdo salad. Visiting from Calif. We will eat here again on our next visit."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. Clean and friendly service. Wonderful margaritas, and the chips are yummy"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch food. Carnitas are awesome and the white chocolate tamales are a nice finish."}
{"text":"This is a must visit place in Downtown Phoenix. The staff go out of their way to make each visit an experience. Tony, Richard, Kristen ,Amanda and the rest of the staff fo out of their way to make each guest feel special. The Chili Rubbed Sirloin is a must have and the margaritas are wonderfully refreshing. Anyone in the Downtown area for any reason should make it a point to visit this place. The fire pits in the evening are an amazing site as well. This place is 5 plus stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I live downtown, and Sam's has become one of our favorite regular spots (bonus that the AMC theater is right there, too!). The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad but nothing spectacular to say about Canyon Cafe. 

My meal started with chips and salsa, but not normal chips Tortola chips, sopapilla chips and tiny sweet potato chips... all covered with Chile spice. Seemed like a good idea but the portions aren't right and the chili space conflicts with the salsa (which was good) but did not create a synergy.

I had two tacos and made it a meal with beans and rice. The Bison taco was slightly over spiced and being that the ground bison was very light in texture it took in too much other characters and was hard to differentiate from other beef. my chili Relleno  taco had mushrooms and an overabundance of tomato paste making it almost like lasagna.

Overall I have to say it's like they are trying too hard and creating these fusion recipes that miss the mark. Although things were palatable, the concepts employed were okay, and the service was good I have to give it a 3. I did see many good dishes I wish I had tried instead so I'm not completely averse to trying those items, but the tacos were certainly lackluster."}
{"text":"I was at Sam's for a work dinner with a group of six.  I couldn't believe that I had never been here before and I was excited to try a new place, so I could Yelp about it, of course!

My co-workers and I walked up on the wrong side of the cafe and came through the patio area.  Normally, I don't think this would have been a problem, however this night they had the majority of the patio roped off for a private function and we looked like we were trying to crash it.  Oops.  No harm done, they still let us into the restaurant.

While waiting for everyone in the group to arrive, the two girls at the hostess stand were watching us with little to no expression on their face.  I felt a little uncomfortable, they were not friendly and welcoming by any means, but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out.  We decided to sit inside as it was a little warm outside.

The server was nice and even joked around with us a bit.  I ordered the Orange Beso margarita.  It was good, since it was made with vodka instead of tequila, it wasn't quite a margarita for me, but hey, it tasted good.  Since they drop off the shaker so you can refill your own, it was the margarita that seemed to never end.  That made me happy!

Plenty of other people have mentioned the cool assortment of chips and the great salsa so I won't get into details.  I just leave it that I loved both!

For my meal I ordered the Black & Blue quesadilla.  It sure was yummy!  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and as I've mentioned in many other reviews, the right amount of blue cheese is always a winner in my book.  This quesadilla was right on the money, not overpowering with the blue cheese.  I ended up taking half of it home.

As plenty of other reviewers have mentioned, the white chocolate tamale was great finish for the meal.  I'm not so big on desserts, but I usually crave a bite or two of sweet to finish lunch or dinner and this did the trick!

I can't wait to go back on the weekend to relax on the patio, drink some margaritas, and try more food.  I think next time I'd like to try some tacos . . ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch on the patio overlooking a gorgeous scenery. Chicken enchiladas are a must! Yum!"}
{"text":"superbe terrasse au bord du jardin des fontaines.;trés romantique..;bonne cuisine un peu spicy"}
{"text":"Sometimes you take a risk when you order the dish the waiter/waitress recommends.  This time the risk paid off!  She was 100% correct that I would love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken.

Talk about some good flavors.  First of all, if the dish includes goat cheese, it probably has already won me over.  You add creamy red pepper sauce (not spicy), a little pico de gallo, some asparagus and put it all on a bed of rice pilaf and I'm one happy camper!

Our waitress was nice.  Not the most attentive (considering we were the only ones in the dining room at first), but she was pleasant.  I wouldn't go back here based on just the service in other words.

The chips and salsa was a bit of a miss for me.  They seemed like they were fresh chips, but they were a strange mixture of sweet and salty that was a bit confusing.  Plus, we had a ton of broken chips so it was hard to enjoy the salsa.

Will I be back?  Probably.  I don't know if I'll want to try something else since I enjoyed the chicken so much."}
{"text":"Yummy Margarita, interesting fried calamari, and fabulous blackened fish tacos!

We decided we wanted Mexican Thursday night and found out within a walking distance of the Convention center you have about 3 choices for dinner.
The one closest was indicated as herendous, so we immediately skipped it. One of the \"ambassadors\" suggested this place and said the carnitas were fabulous.

We arrived right about 6pm and had no trouble getting seated outside. Our waitress was really friendly and happy.
I started with a house margarita (rocks, salt of course) and it came in a shaker that help pretty much the equivalent of 2!!  Hence the limit to 2 to a person! 
Very tasty! I didn't think it was very strong till i got up and started to walk around!

The chips and salsa were interesting. There were 2 different type of chips - some puffy with a bit of sweetness, some regular. Definitely tasty. And the salsa was good!

We started with corn encrusted calamari - very interesting and yummy! I did the blackened fish tacos, hubby went with the steak and blue cheese quesadilla.
The fish was amazing! Make sure you get extra salsa! The quesadilla was weird - not something we would get again."}
{"text":"Long time user of Yelp...first time reviewer and Sam's is the reason!

WOW...what a great restaurant and an even better experience.

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!

Then, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!

Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.

And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!

I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.  PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food.

Thanks Sam's...WOW!"}
{"text":"Went here per a friends margarita suggestion. I had the Rico Rita which was a piña colada-ish flavored margarita. Very tasty while a little on the light side. For $10 you got about 2 glasses worth as they bring out the shaker, which was nice. I didn't order an entree but I did attack the chips which were awesommmme! The basket was a mix of a few different types, including sweet potato, with a southwestern spice sprinkled on. Yum yum yum! I would go back for the chips and a heavier handed margarita!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, I couldn't stop eating the chips and salsa. It was my first time here and I want to come back soon. KEITH provided awesome customer service. I felt welcomed and well taken care of, his recommendations were great. Food was amazing!!! I know I'm coming back!!! Thanks Keith and who ever cooked my food"}
{"text":"The other day my coworkers and I decided to go to Canyon Cafe.  Also this restaurant used to be called Sam's Cafe.    They changed names back in February.  

So, we got our drinks and we order the Queso dip to start our meal off and then we ordered our food.   Then the Queso dip came out.  It was really good, but it was also a little runny.  

Now for our food, when they were handing us the food.  The lady was passing the fajitas across me to my coworker and the juice from the fajitas spilled all over me and my meal.  Luckily I had my napkin in my lap, but it still got on my jeans.  You would think that a manager would come over and apologize for what happen or at least comp my food.  Instead they told me that they would pay for my dry cleaning bill, if I wanted to get my jeans dry cleaned.    

Other than the spill the meal was great. I ordered the basin Meatloaf. I totally recommend the meatloaf.  It was one the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  Last but not least our waiter was really nice and did a great job taking care of us."}
{"text":"This is the first sit down restaurant I ate at here in Phoenix and I have to say it is just awesome. The service was great, the food was super delicious (I had the street tacos w/ rice and beans), the salsa is probably one of the best I've ever eaten. Great ambiance. Love that you can eat outdoors or indoors. Will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"The margaritas here are good.  All of them.  We stopped in during our Cinco de Mayo, Tour de Margarita, and were not disappointed.  Unfortunately we did not eat during this visit, much to the detriment of our sobriety, but I'm sure there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Margaritas and chips are awesome!   Guacamole is to die for 
I also got 2 tacos.  They were good but hard to eat after stuffing myself with chips guacamole and salsa. 

I would recommend 

Dessert coming yet..,,


Down here for the  super bowl"}
{"text":"Came on Cinco de Mayo.....friendly hostess, nice server, excellent margaritas and yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite to eat. Very tasty and very easy on the wallet! Service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Phoenix Awesome location. Chicken and Shrimp tacos were amazing. The Margarita coleslaw was a nice fresh take on the classic coleslaw. I will definitely come back. The White chocolate almond tamales were awesome."}
{"text":"I've only been here for happy hour and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Margaritas for $3 and food items for $3, $4, or $5. I had two margaritas and a chicken quesadilla and spent only $10. Can't really complain about that. The bartenders are cute and friendly and they have MLB Network. What more does a girl need?"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was fantastic.  I had the chicken quesadilla and I swear it was the best quesadilla I have ever had.  I went with some colleagues for lunch, while on a training break.  We all had different entrees and all loved our food.  When I checked in on Yelp, I was pleasantly surprised with a free desert.  I got the cheesecake and fell in love.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I would moreso give this a 2.5 rather than 3 but it was pretty good! The salsa they bring out with chips is very smoky and rich/tomatoey. Pretty interesting combo with the chips that have some sort of sweet spice dusted on them. I got the pork chili relleno. Beautiful presentation and very filling, but the flavors were a little bland. The rice very much so. I also ordered a tres leches cake which was honestly disappointing. The patio setting is beautiful so if the weather isn't sweltering hot, definitely sit outside!"}
{"text":"This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!

We basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. 

Anyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.

The food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.

I had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!

My mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!

It was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. 

Again, our waitress was not very nice to us. So I'm taking off a point for the service.

We were out the door by 10:40pm."}
{"text":"AMAZEBALLS! Great drinks, delicious food and excellent service.  Beautiful views, patio comfortable. Will come back often...bottomless chips and salsa like no other. Exceeded my expectations by far."}
{"text":"I went with three others on a Saturday afternoon. We were not greeting with a warm welcome. The hostess was very rude to me and the others in my party. When she seated us she did not tell us when our server would be around and she didn't check the cleanliness of the table. There was fresh bird poop in multiple places on our outside table. We moved OURSELVES  inside and the hostess never came to check what the problem was or why we moved.The restaurant was pretty much empty so she should've been able to do that.  All but two plates at our table were dirty. We waited about 15 minutes before we actually saw our server. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. We waited another 10 minutes for those. We waited 20-30 minutes for our food and when we needed any kind of wait staff there was no one around. On top of that they don't validate parking and if they do they didn't offer that. When we finally got our food our meters for our car had ran out and we had to go out to refill them. The food tasted good but I've had better and for the amount of food you get I think this place is overpriced. I definitely will think twice before dining here again."}
{"text":"Good food, and excellent service. I recommend asking to be waited on by Johnny."}
{"text":"Although the house margaritas and table made guacamole were outstanding the rest of our meal was not worthy of 2 stars. I tried the chicken enchiladas and after unwrapping the rubbery flour tortilla I found only a few small cubes of chicken the size of sugar cubes. The rice was smothered in so many flavors that it did not appeal so left behind most of my dinner. Tilapia tacos were thin pieces of tasteless blackened fish and one of the two tacos had a piece as this as the taco shell itself. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I am so expressed by the courtesy of the manager of this restaurant when my Agency had a fund raiser at the Arizona Cafe.  He invited our team to have lunch, gratis, after all the work we had done.  

The service was excellent and the food very good.  I had the carnitas which were a little spicy for my liking but there was plenty of it and take home provided a lunch the next day.  I have GERD so maybe if I had not just had a stressful week, they would have agreed more with me.  The second lunch I had a few days later, a salad was even better, very fresh with a dressing that was not overpowering as they can be.  Once again, excellent service.

The only thing I regret was the weather was on the cold side.  It looked like the patio would have been a beautiful setting for a nice lunch.

I have no issues with suggesting you try the Canyon Cafe."}
{"text":"Such a great time and the food was delicious. Topeaka was super awesome and such a sweetheart!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sam's several times and have never been disappointed. My most recent visit was last night. We skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding! You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert. I also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I can't say as much for the service. Our server forgot to put in the order for one member of our party and of course didn't notice until the rest of the order arrived. The manager offered a half assed apology (they couldn't have felt too bad about it, they didn't offer any kind of discount). This was pretty much the turning point of the evening; our server seemed to avoid our table for the rest of the evening. We even had a hard time getting our check so we could leave. Undecided if we will try them again."}
{"text":"I remember the first time we had a White Chocolate wrapped tamale.  It was here, about ten years ago. 

Canyon Cafe is a fun, southwest culinary stop - that your taste buds will thank me for later. Whenever, we're near the AZ Center, we try to make a stop here (boy, do we still miss their Biltmore location).  So in Yelp lingo... yes, we are a Fan. 

Mind you, don't get me wrong, they're not perfect - which is why this isn't a Five Star review.  But Canyon Cafe has so many things going for it, it's an easy Four Stars.  A no brainer. 

First, let me start with the chips and salsa. Their pita chips are made in three different styles, Chinese Puff Wonton, Sweet Potato and a Sweet & Spicy combo (photo).  

I could write a few hundred words on each.  Their complex flavors, the spices used and yet, the star here is their smokey chipotle móle Salsa. Wow, what an incredible layer of flavors. It's chocolate base comes through ever so gently, with a hint of heat that doesn't overwhelm. Nice. 

Second, what to drink. Every Mexican inspired restaurant has a bunch of margaritas on their menu. And somewhere in that predictable and pedantic, sirupy mess is some tequila. Yawn. Boring. 

Canyon Cafe's drinks are a must. Names like Grand Canyon, (which is a Prickly Pear Catcus nectar type), Blue Moon (made from Blue Curaçao), and Mango Rita are all delicious. Really outstanding. But our favorite, is their Raspberry Chambord flavored Coyote mix. It's a must. 

Okay, what's for dinner?  Everything here is good and their fish tacos are the best.  But tonight, we went with the \"Naked\" Chile Relleno and the Panchos Enchiladas roasted chicken, both were $13. 

Their charred poblano pepper Chili Relleno, reminds me of some of the best we've had in Santa Fe (photo). It's a fajita marinated steak, with adovo mushrooms, beans, light melted cheese, and a level 4/10 heat index ranchero sauce, served on a bed of rice. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. The rice itself is outstanding.  I even took a photo of it, so you could see how complex and interesting it is. 

The Enchiladas comes with chucks of chicken, Jack cheese and a three pepper cream sauce (photo). It's fresh tomato salsa is nothing like the móle serviced with the chips, it's light and tasty. It also comes with its own southwest rice and greens. 

For dessert, we used our free Yelp Coupon and went with the flourless chocolate cake. It was thick, rich and chewy. Nice!

Our server Kristen presented us with our white chocolate wrapped tamale (no mas!), and the bill which came to $58.74, including taxes but before gratuities. Kristen was always nearby and very friendly & pleasant; so ask to sit in her section. 

Enjoy,"}
{"text":"I visited over the lunch our.  My friends had a taco salad that was not very good.  My food on the other hand was excellent (the spinach portabella quesadilla). So two bad meals and one good, why the 5 stars, right?  None of us said a word about the meal issues but someone came up and asked if we weren't happy and they told them the beef was a little tough and not good.  Almost immediately the manager shows up apologizing and explained there had been done kind of different meat than usual- they had noticed that they had not fished the meat and so they I wired.  They told us they would discontinue use of that meat vendor and they took it off our bill then brig ought complementary desserts that were also amazing.  My food from start to finish was excellent and the service recovery was impressive.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food overall.  The guacamole was excellent!  The group enjoyed their entrees overall.  I had the seared tuna which was very good. Margaritas were potent...which is good .  Desserts were also enjoyable - tres leche cake was moist and tastie.  Atmosphere was ok.  Cost per person was about $40 person with a drink or so."}
{"text":"Tasteless. Nasty. 
A definite go when you have no desire to eat good tasty food, and no desire to impress out of town visitors. Calamari tasted like rubber, prickly pear margherita was iced down to the fullest. My stomach hurts. But the staff was nice."}
{"text":"I hosted a group lunch for 35 people on the patio at Sam's a week or so ago.  They were so prepared and had our buffet ready to go when our group arrived.  The chips and salsa are amazing...a meal all into themselves.  The chicken enchiladas were so tasty.  The patio is the place to sit at Sam's to overlook the beautiful gardens at the Arizona Center - such a great view!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a big group of people, probably over 30 people, and I have to say I was very impressed with the hospitality and great service from this restaurant. 

First off, my group made reservations at the wrong restaurant and we were staying at the Hyatt about 5 min away and we had no idea where a group as large as us could eat last minute. However, our concierge directed us to Canyon Cafe and upon calling, they were very willing to accommodate for our party. Luckily, it was a weekday evening and there were not too many people there. When we arrived we were welcomed by a very beautiful patio area with palm trees, string lights, and a pond, perfect for a group picture. The restaurant was charming too with a Tex-Mex influence. I also must compliment on their hospitality when one of our group members changed from eating outside to inside last minute and the restaurant had to accommodate very quickly. 

I tried their Orange Besos alcoholic beverage and it was delicious. The price seemed like a lot at first but you get enough for two servings so you can easily share with a friend, or be selfish like me and down it all. They serve salsa and chips as you are waiting, but that was honestly the best chips and salsa I've ever had. The chips had really great seasoning and the salsa was the perfect spice. I also ordered chicken quesadilla for my meal, and I strongly encourage you to share unless you're a fatty like me! It was really good too, they have chipotle sauce on it that tasted great, along with guacamole on the side. I enjoyed it for breakfast the next morning as well.

I have no complaints against the restaurant considering we threw a lot on them last minute. Getting our checks took a while, but what can you do when you have a group this large. All in all, I enjoyed this restaurant and give huge props for their service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  My first visit was great.  The service was perfect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the chips and salsa and the special of the day was excellent.  It was a very interesting mix of Italian and southwest.  

My second visit didn't go quite as well.  My group was sat at the very back of the restaurant and the servers visits where few and far between.

Perhaps I should stop wearing my \"bearded for her pleasure\" shirt when I eat out..."}
{"text":"Coming from Portland, OR, Phoenix is like going into the twilight zone. I actually asked the hostess where all the people are. Downtown Portland is filled with people all the time. I realize that the 100+ degree weather is a downer, but I've seen maybe 100 people in my whole day. Most of them working.

So needless to say, the Cactus Café was not busy. In the over an hour I was there no more than 10 people came through the door. The atmosphere was great. The chips and salsa was very good, the chips were seasoned with chili and were of different varieties which is different from the chips I expect at a normal place.

I was recommended the Chicken Tamales which were delicious. They were served with a normal salad, and I think they could be more creative for a side dish than just a plain romaine lettuce salad. By checking in on Yelp I received a free dessert which was a great bonus. The server recommended the Banana Burrito, which I will recommend to everyone. Who doesn't love deep fried tortilla filled with bananas served with ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel. It was delicious. The price was bearable for a downtown atmosphere, basically what I expected, but the desert as a bonus really made it worth it."}
{"text":"Came here twice for dinner while staying at a hotel across the street for a conference. Staff was very friendly. Food was awesome. The first night I had the Carnitas Platter...second night I tried Pancho's Enchiladas. The chips and salsa were yummy! Nicely seasoned, and once in awhile you'll find some sweet potato chips mixed in. The white chocolate tamale they give you at the end of your meal was a perfect ending."}
{"text":"I went to Sam's cafe with a group of 8-10 and they had no problem accommodating us, even though the restaurant was packed.  The service was great and the food was amazing!  The complimentary chips and salsa were addictive.  The variety of chips was incredible, sweet potato, multicolored corn chips, and some other unidentifiable but delicious vegetable based chips.  Amazing.

I had a stuffed chicken dish and my date had the carnitas plate.  I tried them both and they were really delicious, but the carnitas was definitely the better of the two.  It was moist and tender, but with delicious crispy caramelized edges. 

I didn't hear a single complaint about the food and drink from anyone at the table!  The only complaints I could possibly voice are about the atmosphere.  It was very crowded on a Friday after work and so it was pretty loud.  The sun beating through the floor to ceiling window was a little much, I was blinded for the first third of our meal and it was a little warm.  Once the sun went down, it was pretty great though.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.

Canyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.

My first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! 

My fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.

In the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.

This particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. 

I'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,

\"Oh, you're not finished?\"
    No.
\"Just enjoying the weather?\"
    ..........

I think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas."}
{"text":"Very busy Saturday night arrived near the end of happy hour.  Was a 45 min wait but we were able to sit in the bar.  Calamari  was delicious.  I had the ahi salad..yummy.  Got the free dessert with yelp coupon.  Oh, the 'Rita's to die for!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference at the convention center and stumbled upon this place across the street for lunch one day - what a happy surprise!  Loved the house-made chips they bring as soon as you're seated - not just your average tortilla chips but also wontons and sweet potato chips, and all with a nice sized bowl of a really flavorful smoky chipotle-style salsa - delish!  It's a good thing the kitchen is quick because my Cobb salad that came out a short time later was gigantic.  I would probably say this is one of the top Cobbs I have ever had - every item on it tasted fresh and crisp and good quality, and there were a lot of unique items included - oh so much more than your average Cobb.
I planned all week to go back at night for dinner and margaritas but never did make it - boo!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! It was a convenient walk from our hotel. The restaurant atmosphere was great. Everything was reasonably priced and the service was good."}
{"text":"Best $8 lunch, the chips and salsa was a great start, a mix of chips with a thick, flavorful salsa. The the two large chicken enchiladas with salad on the side was plenty. Service and outside dining was great."}
{"text":"It's the best place to come to eat with your friend and family I would recommend this place to any one who wants to come chill and have a good time food"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fantastic and authentic southwestern food. The chips were homemade and had a nice little kick to them as well as the salsa. And the flautas were really tasty and nicely presented. The waitress was very friendly. You really can't beat sitting on the patio on a clear evening.  The prices were totally reasonable too."}
{"text":"For me, this place is very satisfactory. It's not super great, but it gets the job done. Also, I liked the chips and salsa that they served starting off. It was a nice mix of torilla chips and sweet potato chips. The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end.

My one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate. 

Lastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill. Come here to eat, don't come here for fine dining."}
{"text":"A hidden place with good food and terrific service. Limited beers but choices at good. The bison meat loaf was very well presented and a great choice."}
{"text":"Came here upon my cousins recommendation. Glad we did. We sat outside on the patio because it was unbearably cold inside. The chips and salsa were different than ive ever had: crispy, good spice with a hint of sweetness. A raspberry margarita hit the spot. I ordered a chicken salad, lots of breast meat chicken, and a delicious salad dressing. Great service, just watch out for the birds they are ready to EAT too!! When in town i'd come back here."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife while I was in town for a conference. We ate here because it looked nice and was located close to our hotel. We were seated and waited quite a while for a server. Our server did not introduce herself, and it was obvious she didn't know the menu well. It eventually became apparent she was training, but no one ever told us this before we asked her. 
We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which we had to remind her what we ordered and it took an excessive amount of time to arrive. 
We had ordered guacamole as well, and had to ask about it after not receiving it, her response was \"oh yeah.\" 
I didn't see her waiting on any other tables, so I'm not sure what was so difficult.
The food was okay, not spectacular. 

I might come back, but better supervision of a training server would be nice."}
{"text":"Nicely located in the Arizona Center in an open air mall downtown which is beautiful with lush landscaping. Some pricey entrees but there is lots of price ranges and options to pick from. They had terrific 3 flavor chips and a wonderful smoky chipole type of salsa to start. All of our food was fantastic and flavorful. Our waitress \"Topeka\" was excellent, and she was a one person show making the homemade table side guacomole, along with being a top notch wait staff person too. Beautiful magarita's and I had a killer mojito which was best I have had for years. We split the table side steak fajitas with all the extras! We will would go there again anytime, Next time for happy hour too 4-7pm and be happy!"}
{"text":"Wow! So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally, so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed. It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night. 

I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. 

I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time."}
{"text":"This place is great! Definitely deserves more than the 3.5 stars it has on here!

The chips and salsa are the best I've ever had. I got steak fajitas that were excellent. My friend really enjoyed her meal as well (can't quite remember what it was). Very fair prices, almost cheap for how good it is and the ambiance is quite nice. Definitely worth a visit, I'll probably eat here every time I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I like the food at Sam's and I like the happy hour. I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  

But here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. 

THEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Yummmmy. For such a humble name, this place really exceeds expectations.  

Nice ambiance, and good food.  They really impressed me right off the bat with their chips and salsa.  The chips were assortment that were quite good and far from the ordinary corn tortillas you'd expect at any old Mex/Tex-Mex restaurant.   I had  the tortilla soup and the spinach & mushroom quesadilla which were quite good too.  But, I must say, the best part was the white chocolate tamales that they serve at the end of the meal... a most pleasant surprise and a wonderful end to a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviews, this place has the potential to be a go-to Downtown Phoenix restaurant, but falls short on so many levels. The only part of my meal that I can say was good was the chips and salsa - that is the only thing they have down. The staff was okay.  But there are so many other restaurants near here that it is going to hard to come back.

They have a great outdoor patio and location so they have the ability to thrive. My coworkers and I all felt the same way, our main entrees were awful.  All I had was a salad and soup, and I'm not sure how that can be messed up but it was.  There was not enough flavor and overall zest.

Canyon was kind supplying us with white peppermint chocolate tamales for dessert, which were quite tasty. But that is not going to be enough to win back the meal."}
{"text":"I returned here fr a birthday lunch with a co-worker.

I was a bit sad to see the Tuna sandwiches was removed from the menu leaving me with the $13 tuna plate option. It comes with two decently sized Cajun pieces of tuna, on a bed of rice and veggies. I asked for rare and it came medium well however.

There is a new small bites menu for budget conscious lunch crowd.

The validation is no longer of much use, it is just $1 off now.

As allays the chips are great."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I usually don't complain about service but this has happened way too many times.  This establishment I frequent once a month at least and service is typically good.  However, tonight, Valentine's Day, I decided to meet up with a relative.  I go to the restroom come out to my table, the waiter never asked me for my meal order, barely asked for my drink order.  I was completely unaware that he had already taken my cousins order until he brings out his meal, then he looked at me and said \"oh would you like something\" REALLY!  At this point, I was fuming inside, first of all, why didn't you ask for my order at the same time you took my cousins order this is your job and why at this point would I place an order, generally, most people go to restaurants to eat together and not separate, go figure.  I thought it was completely rude and inconsiderate of the waiter and he seemed oblivious to the fact and there is absolutely no excuse.  I must say this is not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert."}
{"text":"We loved it here! The bartender, Kirsten, was amazing and happy hour pricing is great! Margaritas and tacos were done well and service was really quick and efficient We'll be coming back anytime we're in pheonix!"}
{"text":"If you like Lawry's chili powder and cumin, you will love this place because they are on EVERYTHING. Chips? Check. Salsa? Check. Rice? Check. Chicken? Check. The tableside guacamole and margarita were the highlight, though the guac needed salt (easy fix). Service was good. In my opinion, the food is reminiscent of what you buy in a plastic box at an airport. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my wife last night, as we are both new to the city and were celebrating our anniversary. The food was great. However, the staff went out of their way to go above and beyond my expectations. They were friendly and prompt and the manager made us feel important as patrons."}
{"text":"Below average Mexican food. Salsa is non traditional.  Chips were seasoned which was weird.  Drinks were week, and service at the bar was terrible.  Go somewhere else.  Seriously, not worth your time."}
{"text":"Service was great!! Fajitas were just okay. I would order something different next time"}
{"text":"In town for a conference.  Wandered over to this mall full of chain restaurants and found Sam's to be a gem.

Food was fresh, large quantities. Great flavors.  I had a vegetable taco.  Not the same old bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions.  This had asparagus, spinach, zuch.  

Waitress provided great service.  Gave us free guacamole. Outdoor seating is lovely, though lots of skanky pigeons and flies."}
{"text":"My first and only visit so far to Sam's Cafe was quite nice. The house margarita is a bit pricey, but they offer some good happy deals so be sure to get in on those. I had the Black and Blue quesadilla and it was delicious. Our server was bit quirky but friendly and attentive. The atmosphere on the patio is wonderful. With the fountains nearby and plenty of opportunity for people watching, you can easily relax and enjoy your visit.
I won't say Sam's blew my mind, but I would definitely visit again. Especially for hour happy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I had some great grilled tuna with rice and veggies. It was cooked perfectly and the seasonings didn't overwhelm the tuna. Everyone else at the table got more traditional mexican dishes...tacos, fajitas etc. and they really seemed to enjoy them! I also had an AMAZING margarita. It was a specialty one with citrus flavors, I don't even like tequila but it was delicious. The outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ate surrounded by trees covered in twinkle lights, so pretty."}
{"text":"Service was great! Ambiance and location are good. I had the tortilla soup, which was very good! Not impressed with the steak quesadilla. The meat was a little chewy and tough."}
{"text":"Average, the cheese dip was good. I got the Black and Blue quesdillas, which were great! But the side of slaw was not great, I wish it would have come with beans and rice. Overall it is not a bad place, but not the place to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Canyon Cafe is located in Downtown Phoenix in the Arizona Center. They serve Tex-Mex- sort of Spanish inspired food. They offer a really nice patio, complimentary assortment of interesting chips and salsa and complimentary white chocolate pecan tamales with the check.


I had the Blacken Salmon Caesar. The salmon was ok on a bed of warm wilted greens and garnished with unripe tomatoes. The dressing lacked flavors of anchovy, Worcestershire and black pepper maybe they were busy and the kitchen ran out of those things....? The dressing tasted like mayonnaise thinned down with lots of water and lemon juice. 

My husband had the Chile Relleno stuffed with fajita steak. I tasted a small piece of steak and it was tender and flavorful. I didn't try the ranchero sauce but my husband said it tasted just like the salsa and over powered the fajita steak. (the salsa was very strong with lime)  My husband insisted that I try the Paella Rice. It tasted like boxed seasoned rice infused with enough smoke to season all of Arizona and maybe a neighboring state. I'd say someone slipped with the smoke flavoring.

On the way out we saw table tents on the specials that nobody told us about.

The positives were the atmosphere of the patio, The interesting and massive assortment of chips (some vegetable chips, tortillas that were savory, sweet, plain and different textures and colors) the complimentary white chocolate, pecan tamale."}
{"text":"I'm splitting this right down the middle with 3 stars.  Things I really enjoyed...the patio, location and chips to start were great.  Things we didn't love..again, the patio was insanely loud, and the food was just ok.  For southwest food it hit the mark but wasn't my favorite overall.  And my street tacos were just ok, the tortillas being soggy, almost like they weren't cooked all the way."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas and enchiladas.  the carnitas were fine but no better than what you can get at trader joes and the pancho's enchiladas were just plain bad.  they had no flavor, and the tortillas were hard.  the chips were unique, seasoned and sweet potato, but the salsa was no better or worse than a dozen other Mexican places I've been to.  I'm from California so maybe I'm a little spoiled when it comes to good Mexican, but regardless this place fell way short.  oh!  and I asked for no onions and the plate was covered in them!  poor form."}
{"text":"Great service,  interesting food.  
I ate at the bar and looked it so much I got some friends and went back the next day for more.  The tacos are delicious and you can pick a couple different filings.  

The best thing on the menu is the table side guac.  The dip is delicious,  but the chips are incredible.  I ate an entire basket without realizing it.  

4 stars because it was solid quality, nothing wrong but nothing mind blowing,  so I rarely give 5."}
{"text":"Was just ok... Food wise

I had higher expectations afterall this is az.  Land of southwest cuisine.  Sorry guys it tasted like eating at chilis at an off night...Ive had better mexican food at a hole in the wall in long beach, la, tucson. 

Came with a large group for a convention (15 of us).
-slow service and the restaurant was not packed it was a tue night 730 pm. Maybe they understaff during the week? We still tipped our gal nicely...
-table side guac saved it for me fresh, not too much heat or salt

Apps:
(Calamari too much breading and way too salty. Chicken quesadilla tons of make your tummy hurt cheese)

-had the steak fajitas... Beef was not good quality. Under seasons and veggies over cooked. My rice/beans looked dry and sad like they were waiting under a heat lamp for 30 min.

-my colleague had the shrimp fajitas looked like old defrosted baby shrimp.. Just a sad lookin plate (not worth any pix)

Id come back for drinks and apps but not dinner.
The patio at night is pretty"}
{"text":"Amazing bartender, she treated us so nice. Great happy hour & they also have a nacho cheese bar when you seat inside at the bar. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"It's a day like any other, or so you think. 
During your daily exercise session, a short walk to the mailbox, everything is about to change.
You're a goner now.
It's a letter from the class reunion committee with your wife's hyphenated maiden name on it, and this can only mean one thing.
Saying goodbye to carbs for the next 3 months as she starts serving up swill with hefty amounts of god forsaken vegetables and no carbs. 
Yes, she'll try any diet to lose weight, and on her way down, into this veggie-eating, omni-farting hell, take you with her in the process. 

It's ok, don't panic.
You're a yuppie remember? You live downtown in one of those overpriced lofts, within walking distance from the Arizona Center. 

Here's my recommendation.

Walk to Sam's. It's a few more steps than the mailbox, but at least you won't find any unwanted surprises. 
Carb loading? You bet. 
Order the Desert Fire Pasta, Pancho's Carnitas, or the Chicken Quesadilla. 
All noteworthy, especially if you're trying to negate the affects of your wife's cabbage-reunion soup. 
Sam's delights. Try it."}
{"text":"being in phoenix, i was hoping for some killer mexican food. canyon cafe was ok. came here for dinner, but wasn't impressed by anything on the menu. ordered the steak fajitas and it was unexpectedly sweet. raspberry margarita was good though!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this a 3, is because the Bison Burger was great! Other then that, coming from So.Cali, this Mexican style of food does not compare. But I would give it a try again."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the Hyatt during my stay. The service was awesome and the food was even better!! We had a big party and the waitress was great on refills and bringing out our food. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A date picked this restaurant for me and I have to admit I was impressed!  Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!   

I've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!   

This is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.   Then grab your date's arm and take a stroll through the courtyard, enjoy the twinkling lights and fountains.   There's no way you'll be able to resist the romance!  =)"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice.  Both times, I thought the food was excellent.  Sam's enchiladas, while non-traditional, are admittedly my favorite in town; they are significantly better than Barrio Café.  The portions are huge; the prices, very reasonable; and the atmosphere, especially the beautiful outdoor patio near the fountain, is fantastic on nice Phoenix days.  

And this is all before you consider the chips.  Good gracious, the chips and salsa!  Five star worthy chips and salsa."}
{"text":"My parents and I were so satisfied with this restaurant that i don't even know where to begin.  First off the chips and salsa were amazing.  They had three kinds of chips.  Wonton's, Regular chips, and Sweet potato chips. I got the chimichanga and WOW so freaken gooooood!!!  I would definitely get it again! At the end of the meal they give you a corn husk filled with white chocolate(not a tamale, like everyone keeps saying) which was very quite delightful. Also the setting was so beautiful.  I have never been to a place that gorgeous before and to top it off my parents hate sitting outside but this place they rather of sat outside then inside! lol.

P.S. I went in January of 2012 just forgot to finish my review. =]"}
{"text":"Went to a 2:00 show at Herberger Theater. On our walk from parking lot we stopped to eat at Canyon Cafe. Loved the raspberry margarita, variety of chips and enjoyed our tacos. Yummy, felt a rush of happiness. My husband sneezes after a good meal and this actually was a 5 sneezer!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Mexican food but I did like this place. First, what I ordered: Prickly Pear Margarita, Chicken Pasta, Chocolate Pie, house made chips and guacamole.  The pasta was good and delicious, I just wish I couldn't have taken it home with me and the chocolate pie was to die for. Delicious heaven in your mouth, it was so creamy and good. I shared it with everyone at my table and they fell in love. And for only having one margarita it packed a nice punch and got me pretty tipsy.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and people around. The server was very kind and explained anything we asked of her.  The only downside was the floor was sticky. From the moment I walked in the door and started walking back to the table, I could feel this unusually stickiness under my feet.  Not a big deal once you hit your seat or once you walk out the door.  As long as you're not walking around the place all night then it shouldn't bother you much.  I'm also sure that the sticky floor was a onetime fluke and will probably never happen again should I ever return.

In the end I'd recommend it, it was good food and good service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great find while staying downtown.  Be prepared for extremely slow service.  While you are being seated by the hostess, tell her you want an order of the table made guacamole.  Do this before your waitress comes.  They serve you great chips and salsa but hold off for the guacamole to come if you can as it is fantastic!

The street tacos are the hit here.  My favorite was the carnitas.  There is an option for Rice and Beans but would pass.  It's a tiny plate with a tortilla bowl in the middle with black beans. Richard surrounds it.  Looks cute but the portion is kid size.

Great location and outdoor seating is a must.  Super friendly staff but the only knock is the slow service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Came here for lunch yesterday and I about inhaled the entire bowl of chips and salsa :) BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! I was on a quick lunch break so I ordered off the light lunch menu and had a chicken quesadilla, which had carmalized onions and gave it a sweet taste. I will definitely be back! Yum!

4 Stars due to the fact that we requested 2 bowls of the salsa, but additional chips were never brought to the table. Maybe a good thing as I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl :)"}
{"text":"Ok I have always been afraid of chile rellenos as green peppers and I do not always get along, but man the Naked Chile Relleno was, well words can't describe it.

The flavors of the roasted poblano pepper and the salsa makes me want to pack a plate in my suitcase and take it back to Milwaukee. 

I can't wait to retire out here."}
{"text":"The menu may fool you because it really does look completely delicious and enticing. Don't be fooled. I've had more satisfying meals at Chilis. The food was so terribly bland. My margarita was FIFTEEN DOLLARS CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!? However, the patio is really pretty at night but it's definitely not worth your time."}
{"text":"Good service and friendly staff is the reason why I  gave it 3 stars. The food is the most Americanized Mexican food I've ever had. Don't expect any authentic Mexican food. I mean, it's good, but not great."}
{"text":"Went here for a team lunch during a workday. Food was decent.. Server was ok.. It took about an hour to get our food though so we were getting hangry by the time we actually got our order. Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! ...Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.......... Move over, Manuels & TEE PEE....ew!"}
{"text":"It was so good we went back 3 times during our stay. The chips and salsa are good, but different. Enchiladas were pretty good. Very nice Margaritas!"}
{"text":"If you appreciate good food, cocktails, a clean, well-kept restaurant, and quality service you will be disappointed. This used to be a good restaurant, but is completely run down and the food is mediocre, at best. The chicken on the Caesar was terribly dry. The \"remoulade\" for the crab cake tasted like tartar sauce mixed with French dressing.  The mojito was made with a mix, too sweet to drink.  And the server came to our table of eight with our drinks and called each one out for us to raise our hands. Then she came out with our food and called out our dishes for us to raise our hands.  Really?

As for the atmosphere, the carpet has holes worn in it. The women's bathroom had moldy wood molding and a 3' x 3' hole in the wall covered by a black plastic trash bag taped over it.  As for the awful, old fake plants throughout the restaurant, I don't know what they are thinking. 

I give the extra star for the salsa, everything else was gross.

Owners of this restaurant have no shame and no pride.  I was embarrassed to be the one who recommended my seven friends eat there."}
{"text":"The table side guacamole is a must!  The service was fantastic in the food was very good. The atmosphere, especially sitting outside by a tabletop fire pit, made for the perfect evening."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Started with the complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was full of bold flavor and color while the tortilla chips were seasoned and had a flaky texture. The combination was an upgrade from the bland chips and tomato juice most Mexican restaurants serve. I followed that up with some chicken enchiladas covered in hatch chile sauce, which came with a side salad and corn salsa in an edible tortilla cup. I noted the great attention to detail and beautiful presentation.  Topped everything off with a white chocolate tamale \"on the chef\" which was just sweet enough to satisfy that dessert craving. Will stop in again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"If I come back to this place it for the freebies and not the entrees. 

To begin, I'm a big fan of Tex Mex and I was really looking forward to eating here. Unfortunately the place didn't live up to expectations but complimentary food you get with every visit softens the blow. 

I ordered the enchiladas and carnitas platter with a cup of the chicken chowder as an appetizer. The soup was pretty average, thick and creamy with big pieces of chicken and even bigger pieces of carrots. Not bad but not really worth ordering again. The platter on the other hand was a disaster. The enchiladas were nothing more than poorly rolled taquitos completely lacking in enchilada sauce sitting on a bed of rice covered in some watered down cheese sauce. Meh! The carnitas were even worse: dry, tough and flavorless, I took two bites and couldn't finish the rest. I really don't know how this plate left the kitchen.

There are some upsides however. The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. They brought over two big bowls of chips (assortment of sweet potatoes, corn, and plantains) and some home made salsa. Canyon Cafe also brings over some white chocolate/nut desert wrapped in corn husks. A welcome distraction before you see how much $$ they are charging you. Lastly, don't forget the Yelp! check in for a free dessert. We got the cheesecake and it was a massive strawberry coated piece of deliciousness, probably the best part of the dinner. Service friendly and on point.

Overall an ok experience. Worth a second chance."}
{"text":"Jeff,

Thanks for your response but I won't be going to your establishment only to pay and, in return, be berated by a dimwitted, stupid server who tried to humiliate and embarrass me in front of my friends and family.  My previous review didn't go into details about my encounter but you are misinformed.  Your server yelled at me... publicly scold me to leave and refused service (albeit she wanted the rest of my party of 30 to stay) - all due to her unprofessional conduct! I'm not the server; I'm the paying patron.

Had the server done her job and informed me of your state restrictions or simply been more tactful then we wouldn't have had this problem. Instead she created the unnecessary and upsetting confrontation and by attempting to debase and disgrace me. 

She claimed to be a \"manager\" so she should have known better and I assumed properly trained.  I'd like to think she lied about being a manager rather than think that you hadn't trained your managers properly but that's not the issue. 

As a matter of fact, the server provided multiple pitchers of margaritas and other cocktails simultaneously to the table without questioning the number people sharing the pitcher or anyone's age. Many of my friends were  consuming from the pitchers, other cocktails, inidvidual shots - all in apparent violation of your state's mandate.  

Because it was a large party I paid my bill for our family plus the gratuity however if you'd like rectify your server's misconduct and I'd appreciate a refund for my meal if you're truly sorry for my experience. You can message me directly."}
{"text":"Street tacos were good. Service was quick but it was about 1 pm when we arrived and only a few other tables were occupied.  The outdoor seating by the fountains was nice."}
{"text":"The food is good  nice atmosphere need more on the vegetarian and vegan side on the menu ."}
{"text":"Great people great chips and salsa not good tuna"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in a long time.

Was here on a very slow Tuesday night, there were maybe 10 other patrons. Seated promptly. Our server told my date the specials while I was in the restroom, I got to hear the last one before he walked away. Nice. He returns to take our drink order, repeats it. Walks away. Returns with chips/salsa and my dates beer. No margarita for mama, I think maybe the bartender can't keep up with to 10 people here. Nope. Server forgot. Cuz he's so slammed, right?  We ask for more salsa, which finally comes with my drink. The chips are stale and the salsa is just blah, but we are starving.  After what seems like forever server comes back around offers to get my date another beer. Ignores my empty glass and tells us that our order should be next. 10 minutes later the food arrives. We can immediately tell it's been sitting for a long time. Plate is extremely hot and the food has a thick hard outside, cold in the middle. My meatloaf was dry, hard and flavorless. Potatoes might have been good had they been served within 20 minutes of being ready. My date's meal was also overcooked and bland.

I checked in via yelp and there was a free dessert offer, which I decided against since the rest of the meal sucked. No need to waste my daily calories on more sub par and disappointing food.

Slow/inattentive server+bad food= no return visit for me. Ever.

I think most of the reviews praising the cuisine and service have to be after several of  their \"limit 2\" margaritas have been consumed."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa! Friendly service.  Will definitely go back for more!  This was a first time visit for me, and I can't wait to visit again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Pleasant spot for a margarita-filled lunch or dinner. 3.5 stars

Highlights:
- Margaritas: I loved the fruity grand canyon one (lime, prickly pear, etc.) and the hub got an adult version of a milkshake canister with his 2-limit margarita (got 4 glasses out of that thing!)
- Outside/inside seating: outside was nice on a patio especially at night overlooking some blue lit up trees and misters for the heat, but inside was a nice A/C haven for the height of the sunny day.
- Chips: combo of sweet wontony, yellow corn, orange spiced, and blue corn as well as sweet potato chips. It's rare to find such variety.
- Salsa: great roasted flavor
- Pork: carnitas was a large portion of meat--quite juicy and tasty
- Menu: pure mex and southwestern mex as well as pastas and salads
- Dessert: creative presentation with white chocolate pecans enveloped in a tamale wrapper. Complementary item which was a nice touch.
- Staff: super duper friendly which I appreciated

Lowlights:
- Crabcake: too dense cornmealy for me--couldn't taste much flavor or crab
- Fish: didn't taste too fresh and advertised that veggies would be in the mix, but only limited slivers to were found.

Decent spot. I'd come again for chips and margaritas."}
{"text":"Went to Canyon Cafe on a recommendation when the call went out for authentic Mexican. Well, this place is not what you would call authentic. More like Tex-Mex I would say. Went here on a Sunday afternoon and seating was immediate. The server was really great! She was personable, knowledgeable about the menu, and pretty darn cute to boot! We got the table side guacamole to start which went over very well. Tacos were had by everyone including a special request that the kitchen had no problem filling. I got the grilled chicken tacos and they were pretty good. I put a fair amount of hot sauce on them but the flavors were very good. A nice place to stop in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you, that this was BY FAR the BEST meal of my entire Phoenix stay. Great food, affordable prices, and an amazing happy hour. Kirsten the bartender was totally awesome, definitely try to hit up the bar when she's there!"}
{"text":"Sam's cafe was a nice place to go for lunch or Dinner and enjoy some Tex~Mex if your in the downtown area. They are conveniently located on 3rd not far from the convention center.  The Tex~Mex Decor was sorta fun with a small bar area near the front and a huge patio along the park side of the restaurant.   

The service was a bit slow but they were very busy for lunch.  I think everyone at our table had salads, all were A~OK.  Their Cobb salad was rated the best at our table.  The Blacken steak taco salads were lacking steak and and other veggies would have been nice too in addition to just lettuce, cheese and diced pieces of steak.  The Cobb was full of everything your would expect with a good Cobb salad and was very tasty.  The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.

The chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.  

Suggestion: seek out the \"Info-dude\" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons. We were able to get 20% off our meal coupons from him.  Based on their margaritas and a few other Yelp reviews I'm looking forward to my next visit but will order something different."}
{"text":"Really not that impressed by Canyon Cafe. My work recently moved downtown to our corporate headquarters building, so I am trying out all kinds of new restaurants in the area. Sadly, Canyon Cafe just doesn't cut it. I ordered the carnitas plate which came with meat, fajita veggies, rice, beans and tortillas. The meat was tender but bland, the fajita veggies were not cooked thoroughly (I expect fajitas veggies to be crispy and fresh off the grill), the rice was mediocre. The beans and tortillas were the best part of the plate. My coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars.

The best part of my meal was the white chocolate nut dessert that comes with your check. It's wrapped up in a corn husk and looks as good as it tastes!

One highlight: free dessert if you check in on Yelp! I got the chocolate cake to go. It was super rich and basically a huge block of fudge. The crust was tasty but I hardly ate any of the cake itself.

4 stars for service and convenience, 2 stars for food, 2 stars for dessert (even though it was free). I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Top notch Service the black and blue cheese quesadilla is to die for and the queso dip with artichoke hearts as well! Great service beautiful setting and atmosphere you can sit outside with the heaters on. Truly an amazing place to eat. The attention to detail they have is stunning."}
{"text":"This place was awsome!!  The hotel I stayed at recommended it & I was definitely grateful. Great food, great service!!  I highly recommend it too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and delicious. Your pallet is guaranteed to go wild with the flavors. I had the Bison Meatloaf yesterday and the BBQ was the best I've had. I returned the next day and had the \"Naked\" Chile Relleno. All I can say, it didn't disappoint. Our server, Topeaka, was attentive and gave great recommendations when we asked. The Traditional Margarita on the rocks was superb. 

I was here fo a conference and when I'm in town, I will certainly make a stop here!  Highly recommend eating outside."}
{"text":"The bartender Kirsten was outstanding. Kept a great conversation and made my friends and I feel welcome while we are in Phoenix visiting. Had to come back here twice just for happy hour. Took care of us and definitely made my experience here memorable. Thanks Kirsten!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent as she made us feel like guests in her own home. We'll go back again anytime we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to dine! We have a difficult  time deciding what to order on the large and tempting Southwestern menu. The appetizers are also fabulous...the fried calamari is the best, served with a creamy spicy dipping sauce... large portion....enough for two as a meal. The prices are reasonable and the staff have become our friends. The surrounding outdoor area is beautiful, with fountains and twinkly lit trees. The cafe is located in the Arizona Center so a nice place to walk and shop after dinner.
Ask any ASK ME AMBASSADOR (those guys in orange are great and know what's best in Phoenix) and they will direct you to Sam's."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time at lunch and sat on the patio. It's a large beautiful patio that overlooks a pretty garden area in the courtyard. Nice large restaurant. A ton of great menu options and good drink menu. The margaritas are strong and made with quality ingredients so they limit you to 2.

They start with fresh made chips and salsa. Salsa is homemade with a roasted flavor. It's not Spicy but very flavorful. The chips were amazing!! They are actually a assortment of flour tortilla chips, corn chips, sweet potato chips, and wonton chips. It was fun and creative to try all the different flavors. The sweet potato chips were like candy, so good! 

I got the Southwest Cobb salad and it was amazing. Large with a ton of toppings. Everything tasted so fresh and packed with flavor. The blackened chicken was very tasty. My friend got the sante fe stuffed chicken breast and she loved it, it looked delicious too. 

They serve these white chocolate and pecan wrapped in a corn husk for free with your bill. Tasty treat at the end of the meal. 

The service was okay but the food was amazing and you could taste the quality ingredients. I would definitely recommend and love to come back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pros: great chips and salsa! Veggie tacos were very tasty. Ambience on outdoor patio is great.
Cons: the service. I think our server was just too busy with three other relatively big tables . She took our order, delivered the first round of drinks, and then never saw her again. Not until we were almost finished with our meal. I was able to flag down the hostess for the waters and more chips and salsa. She was helpful and asked if she could get us anything else. We also had to see the hostess for our bill. 
The pork carnitas taco was really dry and the bison taco was average at best. 

Just too many other good places in the area to eat."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  I had the enchiladas and they were good. The rice was also great. the chips and salsa were horrible in m opinion. The salsa was slightly sweet and the chips were a mixture of different types of chips. While this was unique.. it wasn't good. On the flip side my food came out in about 5 minutes. My server was good also."}
{"text":"Good Lord, it's so annoying when a business has an ineffective social media presence. 

I've been trying to write a favorable review for Canyon Café for ages, and every time I go to answer a question for myself, I stumble into their social media circle of death.

Their Website: Outdated.

Facebook: More like an online journal than a business website. 579 Likes. No recent posts. Mostly my photos from previous visits.

Press: Two old propaganda \"articles;\" one from New Times and one from DTPHX; and one random blogger piped in several years ago to say they liked their multicolored chips.

Twitter/Instagram: ??

But why is their website and social media important to your Yelp restaurant review? Why? W H Y??

I'll tell you why: The owners don't care enough to invest in their own company's public image; they're not on top of their game; something's amiss, but what?

According to their website, \"at the end of 2002, Bruce Lazarus and Doug Czufin led a small group of dedicated managers and chefs from the large public company and began operating a small private company...\"

Ugh, what?!? What large public company? What small private company? Which chefs? What are you talking about?

Well, I'll tell you. Canyon Café Acquisition Company LLC, is a former subsidiary of Avado Brands Inc. It seems that the website is suggesting that Canyon Café is somehow better because it's now held by smaller company than it was previously held by, yet it's held by a company dedicated to acquisitions. And, as a side note, plenty of great restaurants are held by big corporations, but whatever, you do you, Canyon Café.

It goes on to say, \"...that's what the Southwest is all about...\"

But according to their website, they have locations in Missouri. Is Missouri the Southwest?

Then it randomly says, \"visit our sister restaurant 1130 The Restaurant at the AZ Center,\" with no links nor explanation.

Ok, but HOW'S the restaurant? How's their food?

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

My friends and I have been going to the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center for years, and depending on what food/restaurant they want to try, that's what we do. 

And one of those times, they picked Canyon Café.

Canyon Café is in a SUPER pretty location. The courtyard, with the mature palms and water fountains, are delightful. Also, the architecture is lovely. They also have a very cozy patio setup.

We sat at the bar, and although it wasn't packed, the service wasn't fast.

The chips were indeed multicolored, and the salsa seemed scratch-made. I preferred the fresh guacamole.

I'm all about the frozen mango margaritas. They were very good, albeit a tad watery.

We also tried their chicken quesadilla, which I liked very much. I'm a sucker for cheese melted on a tortilla, and folded over.

The server/bartender was pleasant, not fast, and not memorable in general: Break even.

CONCLUSION

I can't see how this business stays alive, other than from the weekday downtown crowd and the Phoenix Convention Center traffic.

The atmosphere is the best part.

Canyon Café is good, but not specifically seek it out good.

4/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*Locations: San Antonio, Texas, St. Louis, Missouri, and Phoenix, Arizona.

{"text":"Well for starters, I will say I had given up on going out for dinner so I ate a couple slices of warmed over pizza. We finally went and as I was less than hungry skipped the steak I had been eying. We split a Meatloaf and switched the mashed potatoes out for the mashed sweet potatoes. The two split plates were more than enough food for a regular meal. I can't imagine eating a whole one and I am a hearty eater. We also each ordered a Rico Rita. Yummy and again large portions. The service was good too. I used to go to the Camelback location and the quality and service is the same here. We will be back."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time on May 18th. What a great find! We received tickets to see Diary of Anne Frank so stopped here first.

The chips and salsa were brought to the table initially upon sitting along with getting our drink order. We loved the smokey deep taste of the salsa but the chips not so much, although we ate them. They were a combination of flour and corn and had seasoning on them. I asked about getting some without seasoning and was told that was how they were served. Would have liked them better without seasoning. Ordered the table side guacamole and it was so delicious! Chunky and flavorful!

I ordered the tortilla soup, which was so good.  Rich broth, big chunks of chicken along with tortilla strips.  Partner had the carnitas, which we will definitely be back for!  Tortillas wrapped in corn husks, along with rice and beans.  Neither of cared for the black beans...found them too salty.  The rice was ok as well, full of taste and flavor (cumin I believe).  But the pork...so juicy and flavorful. Also comes with onions and peppers...the whole dish was so good.

Took advantage of the check in deal for dessert and we ordered the Tres Leches cake.  So good, rich, and yummy and was served with a strawberry sauce that just added to the entire experience. 

Service was great and we really enjoyed sitting on the outside patio!  We will be back and will recommend.  Why the four stars?  Beans too salty and not having the ability to get the chips without seasoning on them."}
{"text":"Great experience!!!!

Highly recommended by the hotel I was staying at, my colleagues and I decided to try this restaurant for a \"Phoenix experience\"

The chips and salsa we started with were seasoned uniquely and delicious. Our pitcher of margarita was good too.

Entrees are big and nicely plated. I got the special, a sesame tuna with squash noodles. The tuna could have been a little more rare to my taste but the noodles made of squash were yummy.

The indoor/outdoor atmosphere was great.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The chips in this place are ridiculously good!  I literally ate an entire basket myself.  We stopped here for drinks and an appetizer and were thoroughly impressed.  The Guac itself was decent, the presentation of it was really good.  I was a big fan of this place and would go back in a hurry.  One thing to be aware of is the fact that the advertisements for drink specials on the sidewalk are a little misleading, as they are only valid in the really small bar area.  Next time, I will be sure to grab my drink first in the bar area for the discounted price before I sit down.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for a break from working like a mad woman.  M and I met up!  Had an early dinner.  M got dinner and I got an appetizer.  I got the wings.  They were done, crispy and flavorful.  A little messy but good!

Service was great an the chips are good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato chips .  Chicken chowder  .  Mango margarita .  Everything was really good.  Service awesome & free desert with Check in. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy Hour here this weekend before catching a flight back to the Bay Area. I was with two friends who live nearby and enjoyed their company as much as I enjoyed the pretty view from the outdoor patio of Canyon Café. 

I was in Arizona for the Ragnar Relay so most of the places I saw were on foot or looking out the window of a minvan. This was really the only afternoon of my vacation that I had to rest and relax and see the town. 

Service was terrific. Saul (I think that's what he said) was very attentive and brought us some delicious chips to start and even a wonderful white chocolate tomale dessert at the end. We had $4 margaritas and one iced tea as we sat by the unlit firepit. Everything was perfect! I would definitely return here next time I visit friends or run another out-of-state race."}
{"text":"This is a perfect low key relaxing restaurant with great southwest food outside the usual tacos, fajitas, etc.  I sat outdoors today and there were kids present but it was quiet, and relaxing.  I ordered the southwest Caesar salad which was a perfect variation on a classic.  I then received my entree the Santa Fe stuffed chicken breast.  So flavorful and huge!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  I also got a free dessert for checking in on yelp.  There are small remnants of the previous Sams cafe but it's the good things.  Staff is friendly and low key."}
{"text":"The food was ok. It was good, definitely not bad. I was just expecting a bit more of a southwestern flavor."}
{"text":"The food was bland, the cheese dip reminded me of cheese wiz and after seated I waited over 15 minutes just to give my drink order.  The only good thing was the chips...not going back."}
{"text":"this place was in a small little shopping area across from our hotel.

Service was outstanding, food was great, they do not skimp on portion sizes, better come hungry

A very good choice for our first night in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Food was good. Tell the chef that u do not serve a closed shellfish. And tell the waitress, veronica, that u can't eat pasta with a spoon. Staff could've been better"}
{"text":"Fairly decent upscale Southwestern spot.  Great margaritas and nice outdoor dinning area.  The enchilidas were good, although I think I prefer the preparation at an authentic Mexican restaurant.

The fried wonton \"tortilla\" chips and salsa were an excellent starter."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was eerily quiet and empty until about 2:30pm. 

It was hard to find for my first time in Phoenix and at this mall. The construction really threw me off. 

This place boasts a Sonoran style of food. Not quite TexMex, not quite Mexican - something for the American taste buds in between.

I got the fish tacos, which were spicy and flavorful. I didn't care for the side salad - it was bitter. But I liked adding the side salsa for extra texture. 

The chips and salsa were fun, though I prefer traditional corn chips and these tasted too much like an off-brand of Doritos. 

The table salsa didn't feel worth the price tag for me, but it was okay.

This seems like a fun place to go for happy hour, or with a large group to sit on the beautiful patio. Give it a shot, don't expect anything to taste \"authentic\", and check in for a free dessert while it lasts! Definitely recommend the tres leches."}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.

Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.

They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?

We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.

I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. 

Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table."}
{"text":"To start off, the decor in this restaurant was so amazing. The chips and salsa that was brought out had to be the best I have ever had! We ordered the appetizer with the 3 different options and all of it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Average food in a convenient location. I would probably return if they had cheaper dishes but sure to it's location, it's a bit overpriced.

I really enjoyed the complimentary assorted seasoned chips. It had flavorful corn, flour, blue and sweet potato chips! The salsa was just average though, which is a bummer. 

I ordered the special of the day which was green pork stew. The pork wasn't very tender but I liked the flavor. It had hominy an the rest was soup-like. It came with flour tortillas and black beans. I wish it had rice too.

Husband ordered grilled chicken tacos. He didn't really enjoy it because it wasn't like a traditional taco, but I thought it was okay. It had pieces of grilled chicken with shredded cabbage, picked onion and something like a Chipotle sauce. The rice was underwhelming which was disappointing. 

I would probably return if I was really hungry and I had no where else to go. The decor is nice but the food and service was average only."}
{"text":"The outdoor area was great to sit in during a warm summer evening.  The service was attentive, even though we were the only ones sitting outside.  The complimenatry chips are terrific -- they are a mix of a bunch of different types, not just stale tortilla chips that you may get elsewhere.  The entrees were solid (not earth-shattering), but in light of the other positive aspects, the four stars are well deserved."}
{"text":"Loved this atmosphere at canyon. Lit up patio and patio heaters, good food and very relaxing."}
{"text":"This is a great place for happy hour.   I do believe these were the best chips and salsa I have ever had.  They have a bit of a kick.  Be careful though, they are definitely hard to stop eating and you will spoil your appetitie.  The fried shrimp tacos were fabulous.  I would have definitely ventured back if it wasn't for the lady bartender's bad attitude and poor customer service.  The manager  Angel was nice enough to give my co-workers and I gift cards for our next purchase there.  Not sure I would go back though."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place when i went here for a lunch meeting.  We arrived about noon on a Wednesday and the place was busy, but not packed.  The weather outside was awesome and we wanted to sit outside but the noise from the fountains/waterfalls up against the patio was really loud to talk over so we sat inside.  

The chips and salsa they brought out was amazing.  The bowl had 4 different types and flavors of chips and the salsa had a good taste and spice without being too hot.  For a meal i picked the Meatloaf and it was a ton of food.  2 huge pieces meatloaf that was seared on a grill after it was cooked came out with corn & mashed potatoes and a roasted tomato BBQ sauce.  I ate the whole thing (even though it was more food that i should have eaten) and i didn't feel bad!.  The meeting was a little hard to pay attention to though since the windows faced the pathway and the women from ASU downtown and all of the businesses kept walking by!!!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake I ordered had fungus on it! I didn't even want the cheesecake, I asked for the Banana Burrito and they ran out of that. Definitely a disappointment"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Canyon Cafe because it was extremely convenient- located across from my hotel in the Arizona Center.  Because of that, and the fact that they have a wonderful large outdoor patio (perfect in March), we wound up here two nights in a row, even though we found the food, drinks, and service mediocre.  Group decision, not a personal preference to return.

First thing, both nights, the service was Extremely Slow.  It's annoying when multiple servers/bussers walk by without even a 'someone will be right with you'.  On our second visit, the hostess actually stopped to ask us if anyone had been over after 15 minutes sitting at our table without any wait staff talking to us.  We must have looked irked.

Secondly, they limit you to 2 margaritas, so they should be fantastic, but we all found them to be incredibly inconsistent in taste and alcohol strength.  Out of the 4 margaritas I personally had over two nights; 1 was Fantastic, one was overly strong, 1 tasted like a virgin, and 1 was just okay.

As for the actual food, the chips they serve with the chips and salsa were an interesting and cool mix of yellow and blue corn tortilla, sweet potato (my fav), wonton (second fav), and flour tortillas with a dry seasoning (next fav).  The salsa was meh, but the untraditional chips didn't even need it.  This was the best part of the meal.

I had the chicken fajitas night 1.  The chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it.  The accouterments were just standard.  I ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas night 2.  The steak was very good but the shrimp was tasteless.

All in all, I cannot see why I would ever return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"-1.. They closed early and are not reliable. Don't  going there. The staff closes up early and people who drove from Vegas to check out the #1 yelp restaurant. Never going back."}
{"text":"I wish we could do 3 1/2 stars. I do think the food here is very good and the atmosphere is phenomenal but I don't think it's worth four stars.
But I'm going to give them four stars because that was my first time there and the rest the food that others were having around me look very good as well. Started the evening with a wonderful combination of different kinds of chips and a great salsa and a good house margarita.  I had the pecan salmon very good but under cooked and I wasn't there for sushi. I have attached the pictures And they say at all. Interesting combinations in flavors with in the dish. And salmon for $20 anywhere with all the sides that it came with in a nice dining experience is a good deal. Waitress was very nice and will definitely go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Went in with a couple of friends for a post-softball tournament drink.  Didn't get served for quite a while; all we had on our table were the menus and the chips/salsa.  No water?!

When we ordered our drinks, we got the typical \"you're not ordering anything else tonight?/Well, I guess I'd better go work some other tables for a bigger tip\" vibe from our waitress.  So what? Serve ALL of your customers the same and you'll be compensated.  Silly.

Yummy margaritas, though.  Chips and salsa don't QUITE compare to Aunt Chilada's, but they were better than most (ahem...chain restaurants...)."}
{"text":"I have been to this wonderful place a couple of times now and have had the most delicious dinners and lunches always.  Last night I invited a friend to have dinner here for her 1st time and she was raving all night about the crab cake dinner she had to eat.  The service is always terrific and our server \"Keith W\" did an outstanding job (thank you , Keith) making my friends 1st time there a memorable one!  Thanks to all the staff!"}
{"text":"this place is decent. the service was great. there is a nice outside patio surrounded by trees lit up with pretty blue lights. the food was good; i had the shrimp quesadilla. my fave was the rico rita drink. they have a 2 drink max policy on this drink b/c it's supposed to get you soooooo wasted and um well i assure you i am not an alki but this drink did nothing of the sort. but it was very tasty! i will try to make this at home :P 

i would recommend if you're in the az shopping centre but i wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian fajitas we've ever had! The seasoning was amazing on them...the guacamole handmade, the sour cream freshly whipped. Easily made vegan...the flavor is good that you don't need the cream or cheese...not often the case with fajitas.They even put the beans on the skillet too so those tasted delicious too...beans are cooked in vegetable broth.

Both times we've been here, I've had the sangria...delicious! Queso dip very good. The salsa bar during happy hour is yummy--FREE chips/salsa! Kids' menu includes cheesy noodles that were really good too. Service is fast and friendly. Outdoor area is comfortable and shaded.

Whoever made the menu items vegetarian-friendly did a fantastic job of making the dishes very flavorful--a must for cooking without meat. This is one of our favorite places to eat now! A pre-movie dinner at the Arizona Center...beats Esplanade hands down."}
{"text":"Had a group business dinner here while in PHX.  If you are out of town the location can be a tricky as it is inside a shopping plaza.  Most of the group was about 10 mins late (I know I know...sad when most of us have GPS capable mobile phones).  We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).  

The restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.  

Food was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.  She sent it back and after a few minutes got a new one closer to the rare side but she was happy.

If I lived in the area and was able to visit again I could consider becoming a fan of this place.  Definitely check it out.  Another plus - they have a patio too!"}
{"text":"Street tacos!!!! Margaritas!!! Get the Orange Beso Margarita and the street tacos. I get 3 tacos with no beans and rice. So far my favorite tacos are the spicy chicken and the Poblano Chili tacos. I tried the shrimp one. It was kind of bland compared to the other two. Husband had the gi-normous Cobb salad and really liked it."}
{"text":"Walking by and checked out the menu and decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did. The service is great and prompt. The food was so yummy. And I recommend the limit 2 Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Not very busy on a Monday night. Recommended by hotel concierge. The chips/salsa were ok, but not worth the calories. The table-made guacamole was likewise unremarkable. I think the avocados were still not fully ripe. The calamari was the worst I ever had - fishery and tough. A table of 7 hungry guys didn't finish either appetizer. The main courses were all pretty good. I had the grilled tuna. A bit overdone (scalding hot plate is always a sign that it sat under the heat lamp too long), but flavorful. Overall, ok but I'd probably look for someplace else next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has the best outdoor seating!! GM Tony and Manager Richard are so attentive, kind and social!! If you want a great drink Amanda or Kristin can make you one, two or three:) If you haven't been.....you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"This place tucked in a business building off Black Canyon Hwy (in the Revana building) is a hidden gem! There are delicious smells coming from the front door. I had the breakfast special, biscuits and gravy and hashbrowns. I'm not much of a hashbrown fan, love home fries. They were filling and good, even the hashbrowns. The ketchup dispenser was empty. They have a breakfast and lunch menu, I noticed Naked Juices and Boar Head's meats are served. That's for another time. There is inside and outside seating, several TV's and the decor is very classy yet comfortable with an aqua/brown earthtone theme. One draw back is that unless you have business here, it will probably be hard to find. I look forward to future visits to check it out more."}
{"text":"We were with a big group so service was slow, but margarita and food was good."}
{"text":"Folks, if you visit Phoenix and are in the mood for Tex-Mez you must try out Canyon Cafe. I had the lunch portion of the Enchiladas, rice and green salad and it was great. The lunch portion was perfectly presented, portioned and prepared. Jennifer did and outstanding job of serving and I was very happy I found you for lunch. 

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Pretty setting. Mediocre food.  Mediocre service.  We got tired of waving our hands trying to get someone's attention."}
{"text":"The best salsa EVER!!! I would seriously buy a case of it if I could!!! We sat outside right as the lights on the palm trees went on. Atmosphere was great!!! I ordered the Tuna med rare...really good!!! Loved the area in the AZ Center. Would definitely recommend and go back!! Seriously--the salsa!!! THE BEST!!!!

PS---I just told the waiter once again how much I loved this salsa and he is getting me some to take! So happy!!!"}
{"text":"Only had their margarita, which was enticing due to the local prickly pear. WAY too sweet. Really nice seating outside and waitress was really friendly. Chips and salsa were good. The nice surprise was the white chocolate dessert in the tamale corn husks."}
{"text":"Eating outside at Sam's while birds are awake is a bad idea if you a) have sensitive ears, b) are distracted easily or c) don't like feeling like you're in the middle of a rainforest.  The birds in the trees surrounding the patio are RIDICULOUS.  
Excuse me birds, I'm trying to eat.  I don't need your incessant chatter, and I also don't need you perching on nearby chairs giving me those \"look how cute I am, don't you want to give me a chip?\" moony eyes.  And since you're shouting so loud to hear each other over the water feature, it just means the paying human diners have to yell to each other even louder to be heard above everything else.  Soothing, it is not. 
But if you're a mellow sort and you can let the cacophany fade into the background, you'll be stoked you found anywhere downtown that is serving food on a Sunday evening, and hey, it's early March and you're sitting outside for dinner because the temperature is in the mid 70s!  Gotta love the desert!
The margaritas are glorified lemonade; I had to have 17 of them before I even started to feel a tiny bit buzzed, and even then it may have been just from wishing so hard.
I had the carne asada and it was pretty good.  Flavorwise, it was quite good, although I couldn't get past the feeling that it was flavored with beef bouillon or something, to up the beef flavor.  Texturewise, if you told me I was eating mountain goat I would not have argued with you.  Note to management: sharp knives would be nice to cut through the stringy cut of meat.
My server was fast and friendly, and didn't even call the Federales when I had to confess that I did not have my wallet.  Good thing online shopping has taught me to memorize my credit card number!!!
Oh, and score on the chips & salsa concept: a mix of blue corn, corn, flour and. . . . sweet potato!  Hell yeah!  Only drawback was that some of the sweet potato chips weren't crunchy and had that awful chewy, oily texture of fried food gone wrong.  Who knew sweet potato chips would be good with salsa?!  Prices were great - my slab of some type of animal and onions (don't believe their promises of \"onions and peppers\" - it's mostly just onions) with black beans and rice, and a margarita all for less than $30, including tax and tip.  Not too shabby.
Oh, and don't forget the white chocolate/pecan \"tamale\" they give you gratis.  It tasted just like a Jordan almond if you ask me, and even though you didn't, I just told you anyway.  Better than average mall food."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa ever! Variety of chips.
Our favorites are the wontons and sweet potato chips Favorite margarita. Grand Canyon margarita the best ever! Only $4 during happy hour."}
{"text":"We didn't have a really good experience here, but I don't think it was the fault of the restaurant.  A little misunderstanding with the server on \"gluten free\" food, but otherwise food was good, relatively competitive with others.  Atmosphere wasn't really what we liked, but that is a matter of personal opinion."}
{"text":"After a hard day working an event across the street at the Sheraton, I was pleasantly surprised to find Sam's Cafe.  We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the most amazing chips + salsa which many people have raved about on Yelp.  Towards the end of the meal, manager Nicole dropped by the table to ask how the meal was and we enjoyed talking with her. She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing. But the chips, atmosphere, service and overall relaxing evening made this a 5-start experience.  I'll go back and try something different and I'm sure it will be even better."}
{"text":"They have an enticing menu with great choices and a great looking bar, nothing was really above and beyond to me. However, I would visit this place again. Oh! Their chips are amazing, they have three or four different types they throw into the same basket . .salsa was so-so."}
{"text":"Patio is dog friendly.  Very good service. Had the blackened catfish which was good .  The little white chocolate and pecan praline deserts rolled in tamale husks were outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! I had the Blackened Chicken and Avocado salad which was good. Not totally original but still great. Hubby had the Sante Fe Stuffed chicken breast and said it was pretty good. We had the tres leches for dessert which was delicious. Friendly staff and clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been in Phoenix for a convention and stayed across the street in the Sheraton Hotel.  I walked by the Canyon Cafe and thought it looked interesting.  Also one of the helpful people in the Orange outfits had recommended it.  

I went there twice for Happy Hour and also I had lunch there.  Their Happy Hour prices are 1/2 the price of the drinks at the Sheraton.  

For lunch I had their chips and salsa.  The chips are homemade and have a very unique delicious taste to them.  Their salsa is also good, but just a little too spicy for me at lunch.  I also couldn't decide which soup I wanted.  So the waitress was kind enough to bring me out both soups:  Tortilla Soup and the Poblano Chicken Chowder.  I liked them both, so I ordered them both.  Actually the Tortilla Soup was a little bit spicy.  They were both good though.  I also ordered the Southwest Caesar Salad.  It was good and fresh.  

The waitress also brought me out a piece of white chocolate wrapped in a corn husk. (I think that's what it was wrapped in)  It was very good.  

The service can be a little bit slow.  Especially at the bar area.  Take that into consideration if you're on a time crunch."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed eating at this spot it is really cool to walk around after dinner or before... I have eaten at this spot twice both times really great and friendly service. The first trip I went with the (Black And Bleu Quesadilla) Blackened steak sliced and served in a crisp flour tortilla with red onion marmalade and Monterey Jack & Bleu cheese. Served with tomatillo-avocado salsa, chipotle mayonnaise, pico de gallo, cotija cheese and Margarita slaw. Upon my second trip I went with the (Blackened Fish Tacos)  In crisp taco shells with Margarita slaw, pico de gallo and fresh limes on the side. Served with southwest rice and black beans... I rate the food as followed.

Black And Bleu Quesadilla - A+
Blackened Fish Tacos - C 
Chips - A+
Salsa - A

I will be back to this spot for sure an all around great place for a good meal... Plus the white chocolate tamale after dinner treat will keep you coming back for sure."}
{"text":"You're going to fight your friends over their chips. Their chips they give out have three or four different types of chips, even some sweet potatoes. And I could drink their salsa. I have their grill chicken avocado salad, and I loved it. It had fried capers and I think I ate every single one of those suckers!"}
{"text":"Good Southwestern food: Addictive chips, efficient service."}
{"text":"This place sets a new bar for complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are a cornucopia of crispy warm blue corn, white corn, four, sweet potato, and wonton style flavors sprinkled with yummy seasonings. The freebie salsa is thick and delicious, far beyond freebie grade.

The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.

The table-side guacamole is pretty good. I think I'll ask for extra spice next time.

The outdoor seating s great...overlooking the courtyard mini waterfalls & fountain."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to go for authentic cuisine in Phoenix. HIGHLY recommend, incredible service. The hosts/hostesses are so accommodating and great at what they do. If I could give a 10 star rating for Richard and Shantell then I would! The best service and the most delicious food in Phoenix. Sometimes the wait is long in the evenings but this place is totally worth waiting. 10/10 you guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"We chose Canyon Cafe for our dinner after walking through the Arizona Center and it looked appealing. We asked to sit outside since it was a beautiful, balmy December evening.

We told our server, Ryan that we needed to be in and out in an hour and he assured us he'd make that happen since the kitchen wasn't terribly busy. Waters all around and then drinks were ordered. A had a beer so there's not much to report there. M choice a Mai-Tai and it was VERY strong. We all choked back a swig to verify and then asked Ryan to add something to tone it down, which he did rather quickly. K & I were intrigued by the \"Limit 2\" Margaritas so we each ordered the Top Shelf ConMemorativo which I have to say was just average. Pricey ($11.95) for average.

Dinner selections included the carnitas platter, a spinach/portabella quesadilla, and some kind of stew with jalapenos and all kinds of tasty things...beef? pork? Can you tell this wasn't my dish? I did however, get to taste it and all of us had wished we'd ordered it. It was that good. The report on the quesadilla was that it was good and just enough food. The carnitas were a little dry but the plate arranged beautifully. Canyon serves an odd chips & salsa combo too - puffy fried flour tortillas (my guess on the flour) and then sprinkled with a sweet, BBQ flavoring. Interesting. They were good but we could only eat a couple each.

The best part about Canyon for us was Ryan! He was super friendly, super attentive without annoying us and accommodated all our requests...even one for a picture!"}
{"text":"Just the chips itself is enough for a five star! The margaritas are on point! The Carnitas and enchilada platter is so delicious! A must go in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"\"Great Meeting Room in Back\" - We recently held a meeting in the back room and it was perfect. You were connected to the main restaurant, yet a wall blocked the noise so you could hear our meeting conversation. A glass wall to the beautiful Arizona Center gardens kept you from feeling too closed in. The server did a good job of keeping everyone's drinks filled and timing our orders. She filled bowls of chips and salsa with a mix of blue and yellow corn and flour tortilla chips. The salsa was pretty good.We had the Salmon and a Sweet Potato Puree served with Spinach Salad. It was a wondeful tasty lunch. The chicken sandwich and an enchilada plate seemed popular as well. I think we will keep this our regular spot for our monthly meetings for the foreseeable future. So, ladies, if you see us there on the third Saturday's of the month, come join the fun of the Network of Business Women Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is A-mazing. When I lived in Phoenix a few years ago, I came here almost every Friday for happy hour with co-workers (back then it was called Sam's Cafe). Although I live in California now, I still come to AZ for my dentist (see my other review below) and every time that I am in town I make sure to stop by this restaurant. Their service is impeccable and the food is even better. They have the best chips and salsa EVER. They throw about 5 different types of chips into their mix (e.g., blue corn, sweet potato chips, tortilla chips, fried tortilla chips), and they are out of this world. The blackened fish tacos (I order soft shell) are my favorite entree on the menu, but I also love the blackened chicken ceasar salad. Pretty much everything on the menu that I have tried has been delicious. In addition, the atmosphere is awesome. It has a very relaxed vibe on the inside and the outside patio has a great view of the beautiful landscape (water fountains, palm trees, plants) at the Arizona Center. This is my happy place, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I had in Phoenix. I was super leery because I thought it would be a trap since it's so close to the convention center, but it completely blew away my expectations. The tortilla chips were served warm - nice touch and the salsa was fresh. My chicken sandwich was awesome. The chicken was well marinated and blackened and everything was well seasoned and went together. The white chocolate tamale at the end was a great touch. I plan on stopping back again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin...we came in during happy hour and we sat at the bar, the bartender was nice and greeted us and whatnot. They have this free queso bar but totally not worth it, the melted cheese sucked, clumped together and too salty, also flies flying around. Now on to the main event, the bartender asked us what we wanted to eat, I ordered the wings, my wife ordered the mini pork chimis, and about 15 mins after ordering, the bartender comes back and says they only have enough wings for four wings and that I can order something else...I mean how do you run out of wings at like 6pm on a Tuesday? Now the nail on the head was that just as we were getting our food, my wife and I see a mouse running around on the floor and get caught in a mouse trap. The crazy thing was that the bartender just ran away when we pointed this out but didn't do anything. No one came and got the mouse for ten mins!! Now does anyone really expect us to eat the food?? I mean if the bar has a mouse, just imagine the kitchen!! No manager came and apologized to us, no one offered to comp our meal. It's ridiculous how bad that night was. So be warned before you go here, you are probably dining with rodents. I wish I could give this place no stars."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great!! However, it's not. The chips and salsa and atmosphere are definitely a reason to go! The best I've ever had!!!! The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, \"ok\".  Never an apology or \"oh my gosh! I forgot!\"  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out. 

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. 

So my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I went here after searching for a dinner place around 9pm on a weeknight. Much of downtown Phoenix closes up shop early during weekdays so it was good to find a place that was open with some life to it.

We were quickly seated and ordered some margaritas. They brought out chips and salsa that were actually very tasty. The chips are brushed with some sort of chipotle spice and served with chipotle salsa as well.

For my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas which were decent, but nothing to write home about. All of the portions were pretty large, but I still felt that the prices were a bit high considering the quality of food.

The service was friendly and relatively speedy and they even gave us a little palette cleansing dessert to complete the meal.

Overall, this place is a good place to get your fix for margaritas and Mexican food in Phoenix, but just be prepared to pay a little higher price than you are probably used to."}
{"text":"2nd stop on the dine around. 

Our group gave them a 3.25, which I'm rounding down to a 3. 

We were seated quickly and ordered a round of the grand canyon margaritas. We were brought chips and salsa, which unfortunately was the best tasting thing we ate at the restaurant. I had the carnitas taco, which was sadly underwhelming. The pork wasn't too flavorful. Jon had the corn crusted calamari. I don't have a calamari palate so I can't rank it against anything, but he said it was just average. The drinks however were BOMB (margarita with cranberry, lime, and prickly pear juice), both frozen and iced. Our server was super sweet and chatted it up with us which was nice. I don't know if I'd make the trip back for dinner, but if I was in the area I'd definitely come back for a margarita and some appetizers."}
{"text":"Positives:
*Chips and salsa
*Nice outdoor seating 
*Fish tacos with light salad was delicious
*Affordable prices

Negatives:
*It took 45 min for the food to be brought out even though the restaurant was not very busy and especially after several inquiries about our order, stressing that we needed to be back for a conference.  Because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up.
*Orders were incorrect.
*No apologies from management or wait staff."}
{"text":"Let's say you're in Phoenix for a conference. You want to unwind at the end of the day with your colleagues, have a leisurely discussion of what you've been conferencing about, and enjoy regional cuisine without wallet-breaking prices or concerns that \"authentic\" might verge into \"scary.\" GO HERE.

1. It is within walking distance of your hotel, with a lovely view of a garden.

2. The chips are amazing. Think \"professional chef reimagines Doritos\" for portions of them, but there are also normal tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips.

3. The drinks are exceedingly drink-like, with none of that pesky margarita-mix taste. Order something with prickly pear juice in it.

4. In sporadic meals during my years in Arizona, I've never had service that was other than charming. It's possible YMMV if you hit a huge rush, but if they're not jammed, you should feel very happy and pampered.

5. The white-chocolate tamale at the end of the meal is perfect if you want a little something sweet but weren't up for dessert.

Order lots of plates to share among your group because... the food ranges from amazing to meh, and I'd swear sometimes the same dish has been both amazing and meh on different trips. (I'm certain I had the Pablo's enchiladas with a totally exciting salad and very subtle flavors on a past trip, when it was more \"well, that's an enchilada, can't argue with that\" the most recent time.) The good news is that I've never had a dish be worse than meh, and even the meh-est experience was pretty good for the first two or three bites... so if you have a bunch of dishes and are taking a couple bites of each, the odds are strongly in your favor that you'll generally be very happy.

If that method doesn't work for you, I've had good experience with the carnitas so far. There was also a very pleasant Easter brunch. You're paying about normal street prices, maybe a couple bucks above Macayo's, for enchilada-type meals (and the quality is way better, even on meh days) and $17-$20 for serious entrees.

In any case, you're really here to converse and drink and nibble chips as evening falls across the artificial pond, which experience they do exceedingly well here.

ETA: if you visit on a really cold, sunless day, bundle up! Like many Arizona establishments, this place expects sun through the windows to contribute to a pleasing indoor winter temperature."}
{"text":"I enjoy this Sam's location particularly for the gorgeous patio. I love sitting outside enjoying the water and light features and seeing all the people strolling by. It's a great first date spot because it is distracting enough to inspire conversation. 

Last time I was there I had a table of five grey hairs on my right, and a table of  ten 20 something's on my left. Diverse crowds are always nice. It's a chain, and a decent one and I've been told they make a mad margarita. The white chocolate tamale adds a sprinkle of joy at the end of every meal. I can't wait for the cooler weather..."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with a great view. Nice Variety on the menu. A little bit of everything. Had the shrimp tacos and they were excellent. The chips they bring you when you were seated are to die for! Once you think the meal was over when they bring you the check, it is accompanied with white chocolate! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I will never, ever recommend this place. I asked for a good Mexican restaurant..This is not it... Over priced, and definitely Tex Mex. I don't enjoy cream sauce on anything let alone enchiladas..Went to my hotel and was sick all night..Never..Ever again..The funniest thing is about five different people named this place as the go to.. Ugh.. Never"}
{"text":"I went to this place two times while I was visiting Phoenix. The first time we had a very large party and the service was great! We were seated quickly and served drinks and our food in a timely manner. Prior to ordering I checked out other Yelp reviews just as you are now and the things that stood out to me we're the chips and salsa and the margaritas. Well, everyone said it and I'm gonna say it too! You must try the chips and salsa (my favorite chip is the wonton chip, a little sweet heat! Yum!) and of course to go with it get the top shelf conmemorativo margarita...so, so, so good! I also got the spinach and portobello mushroom quesadilla and it was good. 

It was so Delish that I brought a different large group of friends back to this place. Unfortunately, the restaurant was much busier and I'm not sure they handled the large crowds very well. We were told 1 hour wait, but after 20 minutes our buzzer went off. When we gathered our group to be seated the hostess told us it was a mistake and asked us to wait off to the side in the dining area. This wait was another hour before we approached the hostess. She was very rude and told us it would be 'awhile' but wouldn't give us a time frame. When we asked if it would be 10? 30? 1 and a half hours? She said it would be at least that! Unacceptable when we were told an hour wait. I asked to speak to a manager and Tony was extremely responsive! He worked it so that we were seated right away! The server  was fantastic as she stepped in to take our large party and we were seated outside her section. The chips and salsa came out quickly and she was great with getting us drinks (of course I had another round of the margarita) and the food was great. This time around I had the salmon. So delish! And the desserts were covered by the server as an apology for our wait. 

The manager Tony was great, responsive and helped me to overcome my disappointment in the rude hostess encounter and he brought me back to a 4 star rating for the great service and food once we were seated. I would definitely recommend this place and the margarita!"}
{"text":"We went downtown and had a great meal here.  We were seated outside where we got a great view of the fountains and enjoyed the first cool breeze of the fall.  Our drinks arrived with a basket of chips with salsa.  These chips were incredible.  First, you notice a variety of colors and shapes, second you notice they are warm, almost hot, third the fantastic flavor.  They have a dusting of some sort of mild spice.  There were regular corn chips, blue corn chips, flour chips, squash (?) chips, sweet potato chips..lightly salted and the chipotle salsa complemented the combination.  We ordered our meals and knocked off the chips waiting for our food to arrive.  We ordered more chips, (still hot when they arrived from the kitchen) and our meals arrived. My wife had an enchilada something and I had the southwest chicken salad.  Those chips really enhanced the meal.  The flour chips were lighter and softer, yet crispy and not oily.  The sweet potato chips were slightly chewy and were indeed \"sweet\" and were great.  I had iced tea, my wife had a couple of blue margaritas and said they were very good.  We finished our meals and the chips.  Our waitress brought us a nice white chocolate \"tamale\" with our check.  If you are looking for a full meal or just want a nice place for a beer or cocktail this is the place.  Try the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Al the bartender was the best server we've had! We had a terrible experience at a nearby restaurant and decided to head in to a favorite spot we always enjoy and Al undid the terrible experience we had elsewhere. Highly recommend Canyon Cafe. Plus it's one of the few places that gives you chips and salsa without a charge.  Great food, fantastic service and the best chips you've ever had! This place is consistently good. Al is our new favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch or a casual happy hour when I am in town. The Chips are amazing. They are not your typical tortilla chips. Every basket has a sweet, spicy and regular flavor. The food will not WOW you but then again this is a laid back tex mex restuarant with good margarita's decent food but a really good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've eaten here, and I'm sorry to say, but they really flubbed it this time.
PLUS: Portions are generous.  Chips and salsa as soon as you sit down are really tasty.  Service is solid.  Prices reasonable.  Food is tasty.
MINUS: Way too salty.  Everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable.  Music was too loud for the few other diners and was some terrible mix that had nothing to do with the Tex/Mex theme that was so carefully planned everywhere throughout the entire restaurant.  And final problem was probably just bad luck, but the chili rubbed sirloin, while fantastically yummy to taste, was the most gristly piece of meat I've ever been served anywhere (including the IHOP).  Also managed to deliver an almost well-done dish when I had asked for medium-rare.  Would have given 3-4 stars if more appropriate music and volume, less salt, and properly prepared steak."}
{"text":"walk down and sit at a table in an empty bar.

\"ill have a gin and tonic\"

\"oh i don't think we have gin\"

\"hmm. ill have a house margarita then\"

\"okay\"

(7 minutes later)

\"actually we do have gin. would you like beefeaters, tanqueray, or Bombay?\"

\"i'll do the beefeaters\"

\"okay\"

(10 minutes later)

\"we actually don't have beefeaters\"

\"ill do the bombay then\"

\"okay, how do you want it?\"

\"...with tonic.\"

(many minutes later, checking out, reading bill)

gin and tonic...

$12.

Im giving these guys three stars because they give you a white chocolate/pecan treat with the bill and it was delicious but it wasn't worth a $12 gin and tonic with awful service"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch.  Food was great!  Chips and salsa they give are not only tasty but a bit different than what you might usually find at a similar place.  The Black & Blue Quesadilla was probably the best thing in our order.  My wife said it was the best steak quesadilla she's ever had.  My son had the ahi and gave it 4 out of 5.  I had the blackend fish tacos and I would give a 4/5 as well.  Our server, Cheryl, was extremely nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"We ate here during lunch on Sunday and I can't understand why this place wasn't packed. They have the best vegetarian fajitas, chips and salsa that I've ever had...and I eat Mexican food a lot. The chips are mixed, some are won tons, some are sweet potato crisps and some are seasoned corn chips...all mixed together. Our waiter explained that the salsa takes two days to make the concoction of roasted vegetables. I had my free checkin dessert to go...and there was a lot to choose from. If I lived in the area, I would definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"EAT the chips and salsa!!!  You will not be disappointed!  

Chicken enchiladas are A-MA-ZING!  

Great patio!"}
{"text":"We went here for mother's day meal 5/2014 and I was very pleased. It was an excellent day and we were able to eat in the patio area. I remember that the chips, as I had previous read, were great. Some where deep fried, different flavors, and overall a great way to start the meal. I had the carnitas plate and it was very moist and portions were plenty. The flavor was very good. We also took advantage of a yelp check in free desert and the banana burrito was great with banana wrapped in a crispy sweet tortilla topped with ice cream.

The food was great and vibe was really nice on a nice breezy, summer day. The waitress was very helpful, good service and the chef actually brought out samples of desert that I can not remember the name but it was a nice touch. The only bothersome part that there were pigeons that interrupted our meal a few times but not a big deal. If you are in the area, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was semi-hungry and was wandering around downtown Phoenix and found this Southwestern themed restaurant here in the mall. I figured since I'm here for a few days, that it would be nice to try something that is \"Southwestern\".

Came here for lunch and it was relatively empty and I sat at the bar. Nice clean area, with a couple of tv's for the sports fanatics. The servers were pretty friendly too. Although some of the servers were super bored since there were not a lot of customers.

Again, I wanted something Southwestern so I went with their Desert Fire Pasta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=AykZwJA1xSgxLOBaWbWHOg It's basically shrimp and fresh mushrooms over angel-hair pasta in a jalapeño cream sauce. Topped with Parmesan cheese and pico de gallo. This pasta was pretty much soaked with butter. Is that a typical Southwestern thing? Because if so, I would feel light headed all the time if I lived here.

And for dessert, I got their fried banana burrito with ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=PpE4HMvbpTU7mJdb19VlZA. Nice presentation actually. It's a great theme for a Southwestern style dessert.

Tip: Use your yelp check in to get a free dessert.

Overall, a decent experience, though just a bit fattening to me with all that cream and butter. 

Went to downtown a couple of times, and this place was desolate. I mean everywhere else as well. Not sure why, but it can be a good thing but you must also wonder why...oh well."}
{"text":"Stuffed chili relleno was absolutely delicious. Flautas, not so much. I rely enjoyed the salsa, it had a nice poblano pepper flare."}
{"text":"Being from Texas I am used to Tex-mex Mexican food, this place exceeded all expectations and might be my favorite Mexican food place I have ever had. I am here for business and this is my favorite restaurant I have eaten at so far. It's not super fancy, but everything was good. I had 3 margaritas, all good. The chips are HOMEMADE AND PHENOMENAL. I had the steak fajitas and that is my go to at every Mexican restaurant. I have had better vegetables, but the meat and seasoning of the juice on the steak was awesome. My mom had the spinach and portobello quesadilla and I can't stress enough how good the flavor was to me. I would order this quesadilla again!"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting here more often lately since it is by our favorite theater. 

Our bartender now recognizes us, knows our order, and is sweet as pie.

Seriously one of my favorite happy hour spots of all time."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group for dinner and drinks.  Had what they call the \"best margarita\"--you should get that; they are very good & HUGE!  The chips are great (especially the ones that come with sweet potato chips mixed in).  The guac was okay.  And the blackened fish tacos, while huge, were okay.  I'd say that I agree with most other reviews about the food; not bad, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"I was surprised that it took me a year a half to realize that this place was so close to me. Wish I had known a long time ago. 

I came here for lunch with a couple of buddies and from the very beginning I was impressed. We got seated right away and our chips and salsa came within seconds of sitting down! And let me just say, this is the BEST ASSORTMENT of chips I've ever had at a restaurant. There were typical white/yellow corn chips, along with blue chips and sweet potato chips and other stuff. Very tasty. The salsa tasted a little \"pre-made\" to me but it was still decent. 

I ordered the carnitas and enchiladas platter. It was pretty good. The carnitas had good flavor (but there was only one tortilla) and the enchiladas had a good creamy sauce on top. I also liked the fact that they offered us a carafe of water so they didn't have to keep coming around to refill it for us. I know for some that seems a little lazy and cheesy, but I think it's AWESOME!

The best part was the little mini White-Chocolate/Pecan tamale at the end. It was REALLLLLLY good and wanted about 10 more. Bill was pretty cheap and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Margaritas were tasty but a little light on the booze.  Complementary chips and salsa were better than average.  Even though we didn't get any food the waiter still brought us a white chocolate with pecan mini tamale for desert at no charge.  Nice touch, just for that kind gesture I'll come back to eat."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Table side guacamole is very good.  The chips have an interesting flavor. Not a big fan.  If you like smoky salsa, this is the place.  The carnitas were ok.  I like mine savory rather than sweet and CC's was a little on the sweet side.  

A decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"Good food and good location 
But terrible Service
I had the Buffalo Meatloaf which was pretty tasty but a little pre-fab,
But the service was terrible.  Never saw the same person twice for some reason.  Nobody came back to see if I wanted another drink (I did) or ask how I was doing.  Very rushed.  
Maybe they were short staffed but not my problem.
Ill try them again and see what happens. Maybe,"}
{"text":"We had a long layover so we decided to take a taxi downtown. I'm not sure but I think the taxi driver took the long way there, 20 bucks from the airport seemed a bit much considering how close it was. 
But as for Sam's cafe, we really enjoyed it. The chips and salsa was a good start, I like how the basket was an assortment of chips. They prepared the guacamole fresh in front of you too which was pretty cool. We both enjoyed the food. I had this skillet lasagna dish and my girl had a carnitas and something combo plate. The carnitas were a little dry for my liking though. They were a few items on the menu that looked really good too so if I'm ever in the area again I'll hopefully try them. 
Oh, we took light rail back to the airport for $1.75 each and took us less time to get there. Just in case you're traveling like us."}
{"text":"Was pretty impressed with the food and service during a  very large private group dinner here in January 2015. Some logistical issues are also pointed out but I'll start with the positive:

We had a set menu that included their delicious variety of chips; a generic salad starter; 
a choice from 4 entrées heir seared tuna, vegetable pasta, chicken pasta or sirloin steak (not sure what the exact names are); and dessert. As a bonus they also gave us some corn husk wrapped white chocolate with nuts.

I chose the seared tuna and was floored at how good it was. Two generous tuna steaks/filets came served on top of a blend of fresh grilled bell peppers, zucchini and other seasonal veggies. The tuna was dressed in a delicious dry rub and zesty sauce, like zesty mayo or something. 

Everyone else seemed happy with their food. We were quite a diverse crowd with different backgrounds and tastes so it was quite impressive to hear overall satisfaction. 

A couple logistical things that were annoying was that there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and wait staff so quite a few of our guests who ordered steaks had to wait quite a while until they finally came out. I mean a long wile... like to the point of wondering if they had to go lasso, haul, and slaughter the cow. They were also out of dos equis. Also, this reservation had been made for a month or at least weeks in advance...how do you know you have a group of 45 people coming with a beer & wine allowance and not have a fully stocked selection of your beer? Or, how do you not inform your staff that it's not available so don't suggest it? Anyway, just some logistical problems that could've been better."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner outside on the patio - it was really pretty. The margaritas were pretty good. The salsa and chips were also pretty tasty - it was nice to have some variety- these were no simple white corn chips; there were blue corn and even sweet potato chips mixed in. My fish tacos were awesome, I love spice and they certainly delivered. I would try it again and hopefully find another item on the menu that was just as good."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating in the Arizona Center. They open at 11am and have a nice top shelf margarita selection.  You get a shaker full of drink so it's more like three drinks in one.  We all had soup and salads. It was a good lunch with  nice variety of flavors.  The chicken pablano chowder was really nice.  End of the meal comes with a little treat of white chocolate pecan in a tamale husk.  Yelp check in gets you a free dessert with entree. I didn't think the soup and salad would classify but our waitress was awesome and said she surely could do one dessert for our table of three. 

Great place for lunch. Plenty of seating. Starting filling up at noon."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Service Amazing. FoodAmazing, had the chefs daily special stuffed poblano pepper with carnitas.  Sit outside on the patio for a great view."}
{"text":"Food gets one star
The chips are all dusted in REd chile pepper - why?!
The salsa was - you guessed it - red Chile pepper paste.
\" Phoenix mex\" - and it's awful.  The queso was  truly like vomit and I couldn't eat it.
The service was fours stars because the bar tender reimbursed me five bucks for the inedible queso - which is usually hot melted cheese - please tell the chef.
The margaritas get four stars because the price was right during happy hour but I have to admit it I really didn't taste any tequila.  I won't be going back and FYI the AZ center is truly a ghost town.  Go there if you want breakfast, a manicure, Starbucks or hooters.  That's all there is."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, with unique dishes, yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert. Now it's just average, with nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but somewhat forgetable. They did give us free dessert with Yelp check in... so that was good."}
{"text":"This spot is great for entertaining friends and family with a taste of the southwest that is right in the heart of downtown Phoenix. The servers are attentive and sincere. The menu is full of options for everybody without being overwhelming. The outdoor seating option that sits right next to the garden at the center of the Arizona Center is wonderful for the Arizona weather."}
{"text":"My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. 

We went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. 

The next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. 

The third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. 

The final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more)."}
{"text":"I dined at Canyon Cafe while I was on a business trip there last week.  The atmosphere was layback and pleasant.  I had the Naked Chile Relleno which was amazing and different from the typical breaded one.  The mango margaritas were amazing as well.

What really amazed me is the staff service all around.  The bartender was attentive. I inadvertently left my iPhone by the bar and didn't realize it was missing until an hour after I left the cafe.  I called the cafe and sure enough they found an iPhone which I went back for it and once there the manager verified that I was the rightful owner and got my iPhone back.  Today I needed a copy of my receipt for my business expenses, which I forgot to take with me, and I called for it. The staff person who answered and general manager located the receipt and e-mailed me a copy of it.  Again, I cannot be any more happier with the customer service all around.  Pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Chips & salsa FANTASTIC! Went back for spinach/portobello quesadillas; best ever. Beautiful patio area. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Our group was wondering what was good on the menu and asked our waitress for input.  She said to try the \"Limit- 2\" Margaritas $11.95  Two of my friends said the drink was strong, one of us opposed.  I also disagreed.  It was definitely salty though.
We grubbed on the chips on salsa and drank our margaritas as we waited for our food to come out.  The chips were really good, especially the chips that had the sweet topping on it; but too much of that can make you sick.  I kind of did and had to stop...

Finally our order came out.  I had ordered the Mango Buffalo Salad as suggested by the waitress, and it was a featured item on the menu; it was alright.  I was too full to even finish the tostada."}
{"text":"Excellent chips and salsa, great patio, and consistent food. The \"limit 2\" margaratias are so strong I have never actually wanted a second one. I like the ahi salad a lot, which is a spicy seared ahi with their raspberry vinagrette, and the chimichanga is awesome. Dine on the patio or the bar for the best service, as sometimes inside it can be terrible. The patio is also great in the evening when the place is lit up with christmas lights and you get the view of the beautiful water features and scuptures. Keep in mind the Arizona Center, being the lush green place it is, has somewhat of a cockroach problem in the summer when it is warm, and them suckers are HUGE. Never seen one near the restaurants though. The menu has something for everyone, and everything is decent. If not for the proximity to my home, and the patio, this would be a sub-par bet, however."}
{"text":"Our waitress was wonderful. The service was timely and she had such poise. She really could be on Americas next top model.

Tuna was amazing, but spicy, loved the chipotle sauce. I ordered it rare. The peppers and zucchini were good as well. Though nothing was added to them, I guess they figured the spices of the tuna and chipotle sauce would suffice. Ripe avocados are always lovely and a good balance of the spice. The rice was good, mostly enjoyed it for the coloring...was looking forward to the \"paella\" but was rather unimpressed with the rice, it's nothing like the paella of Spain and likely came from a box. 

Loved the chips!!! Yummy spice added to them and there was a great variety."}
{"text":"Not as good as I had hoped.  Strange menu:  pasta, but no burritos.  Had the chicken quesadilla, and didn't care much for it.  Although, the free dessert deal using Yelp was nice."}
{"text":"Ditto on other comments about the chips n' salsa. Whoduthunk that simply putting 4 kinds of chips would make a basic appetizer so much better?"}
{"text":"I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree. As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.

We started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.

 I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.

All in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again."}
{"text":"Omg the worst place to have access to in the work place. I feel depending on who is ordering they may cook it better like a Person that's looks of importance but if your a regular employee and once they realize you are, they don't care about the food is prepared. My bagal was made with the dried out cream cheese. And no, it wasn't just an accident. They literally spread the cream cheese with the dried out cream cheese visible within the cheese. It was obvious they didn't care. Another time they have me under cooked fries. And That time I ordered a BEC SANDWICH they made it with the wrong bagel. I tired to see of I can avoid the issue. It w ant good. Too spicy and I cant do spicy due to GURD. I returned and it was such a hassle. The Spanish girl.gave me back and bagel with NOTHING on it. And got annoyed at me for wanting what I actually paid for. Then another issue where I purchased coffee and they wanted to charge me extra for the half and half. Terrible service. Just buy your food for work. Don't waist your money"}
{"text":"Stopped at Sam's for a work lunch. Great location. It's good to have places like this downtown. 

Everyone in our group enjoyed the food. From the variety of pre-meal chips, the entrees, and the post meal white chocolate tamales. 

I had the shrimp tacos an they were great. Fresh, rich with flavor, and very filling.

I'd like to stop in after work some time for some margaritas."}
{"text":"It's hard to explain how good this place is.  I've tried everything on the menu now and everything but the kalamari is perfect.

Their food is very fresh and their chef is a true culinary great.  The flavor profiles are amazing, and such a thing is rare.

I could go on for pages because this is one of the 5 best restaurants I've ever been to.  Let that say it all.  Avoid the kalamari, and enjoy one of the best meals you could have.

Also the outdoor seating by the fountain is pretty great."}
{"text":"Dave and I were exploring to new places around our new home and came across this lovely cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  

We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. 

Over all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away."}
{"text":"Really great chips and salsa!!! Also, one of the best Margaritas in town! The food is good, patio has a great atmosphere. reasonable prices for what it is."}
{"text":"Very good! Love the Orange Beso! The Chips and salsa are amazing!!! I got the Bison Meatloaf! Freakin amazing!!!! :-D Highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to mix up the usual subway/corner cafe I usually go to throughout the work week.

To start, I must say their chips were absolutely amazing! What a pleasant departure from the normal tortilla chips that are served at every other Mexican place. The complimentary basket includes several different kinds of chips with a salty seasoning that is out of this world! It reminded me a bit of Steak n Shake seasoning or Lowrys - delicious! I also enjoyed the salsa, tasted very fresh and made in-house.

I went with the blue cheese and steak quesadilla per the servers suggestion (I couldn't decid between the enchiladas and quesadillas). It was pretty yummy and about what I expected. Paired with the dips that it came with (some sort of cilantro/avocado spread and a smokey chipotle) it was gobbled up in no time!

My only drawback is the lack of lunch pricing. I'd love to come back but ~$17 for a quesadilla and soda at lunchtime? I can't be doing that super often. 

Will return again in another couple weeks to explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Whoa - exceeded expectations.  Here with hubbie on business conference.  Had dinner here because of proximity. This was the best meal we had, and we had excellent meals at Barrio and Fez.  Our server Karissa was awesome - she knew the menu well and helped direct us to excellent selections.  Both of our margaritas were delicious.  Hubbie had the classic (not more than 2), I had the one with pineapple juice.  Both well crafted.  Donner salads were a step up from the usual fare.  Dinners were so good!  I had crab cakes with a delucioys tex mex remoulade, he had chili relleno which was heaven.  Oh - I didn't mention the chips/salsa.  Like everything else, they were a notch above.  Salsa had adobo base, chips were homemade and exquisitely seasoned.  

What a delicious meal.  It was also a beautiful location overlooking lit palms and fountain - quite romantic, too!"}
{"text":"Yep still a fan. Mostly of the Grand Canyon Margaritas, they soothe away the pains of the day.  They have what I have now seen to be a rotating list of Happy Hour food options which are usually not bad and range from $2-$6. I usually fill up on chips and salsa. I have not changed my mind on the seasoning they use on the chips (sweet...spicy...meeh) I find myself picking through the basket to avoid the highly seasoned chips. The salsa is good but the large tomato chunks make it tough to get on a chip, or when you do it is hard to get from that point to your mouth without it falling off (usually on my chest or lap). I have yet to order from the regular/full menu. Maybe one day!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and wanted something closer to my downtown hotel. Sat at the bar with the bartender and a manager and had excellent convo about the area. Both steered me to the combo with carnitas and enchiladas - I'm from TN, and a pork purist. The carnitas were fantastic. I loved the sauce on the enchiladas as well. There were very few people here on a Saturday for lunch - not sure if that's a good thing or not."}
{"text":"Ummm...in a word, no!  Waited half an hour, yes I timed it. That was because I wanted to sit outside and there was a big crowd at the time, sort of a convention that must have all gone to eat at once.  Okay, that was fine. I waited at the bar and ordered iced tea, with no offer of sweetener.  Waited and was seated about 1/2 hour later.  Sat, and the menu looked good.  Ordered enchiladas.  When they came out so quickly I was surprised.  When I saw them, I couldn't help but think they had been sitting in a warming dish and that is why they were prepared so quickly.  Taste was lackluster.  \"Salad\" served with it was more like some chopped lettuce, that I couldn't tell if dressing had been put on it or not.  If there was I couldn't taste it.  Cheese on top was a sort of creamy cheese sauce, nothing to write home about.  Served on rice, it was sort of dry and not really hot...thus my thinking that they were sort of held warm until served.  No cheddar cheese, no guacamole, no beans.  This dish needed help!!!  Started to check in on YELP to rate while I was sitting there and noticed that I got a free dessert with my meal by checking in.  Had the cheesecake which was thick...if that is the word.  Bill was $14, which I thought was fair.  Had better.  If you are really desperate for good TexMex, and don't mind a drive, the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel in Scottsdale, yes hotel food, is amazing and a view to die for.  Yes, it's about 1/2 hour away by car, but I think next time I'll make the drive."}
{"text":"First time here, chips and salsa are unique and excellent.  The carnitas & enchilada platter excellent as well.  Finished off with the bunuelo dessert and it was a perfect finish."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend has been to Canyon Cafe in St. Louis which is owned by the people who own Sam's Cafe and we had been meaning to go for a while so he knew what to expect but I didn't.  The meal started out with the chips and salsa which were pretty amazing.  The salsa had more bite to it than normal salsa you'd get at Macayo's or Arriba's.  The chips were a wide variety that included everything from sweet potato to blue corn to a white corn with a sugar coating.  I got the carnitas platter and my boyfriend got the enchiladas and carnitas dish.  The carnitas were mouthwatering.  The combination of the meat with the guacamole and rice made the tacos to die for.  The cheese used in the enchiladas was rich and mouthwatering.  Different than just the typical cheddar cheese.  For dessert, I had the banana burrito which was okay.  I much prefer the banana tempura at Benihana.

Besides the fact that the food was so good, I give Sam's Cafe 4 stars because I lost a piece of jewelry while dining and the staff helped me find it :)

Definitely would return here."}
{"text":"The prices for this cafe were appropriate, and the food had good portions! I am pleased to say that I am excited to come back...although I think they're remodeling currently. Still, my friends and I are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Went with friends to the Pompeii Exhibition nearby at Heritage Square and stopped in for lunch beforehand.   Always a great experience at this restaurant.   I can't believe how great the complimentary salsa is and the variety of chips.   We enjoyed the Blackened Salmon Caesar, Pancho's Enchiladas and Pecan Crusted Crabcake.   Beautiful presentation, bold flavors and exceptional service. A visit by the manager Tony was appreciated!"}
{"text":"Not happy at all and definitely not coming back.
My colleague and I met for a business lunch here and sat at a high top table near the bar. We let our waiter know that we were in a bit of a rush. Even to get our waters took a long time.
I ordered the fish tacos and they were yuck. I was definitely not impressed at all. Aside for my plate taking 40 minutes to get served, it was cold.
We paid and immediately left hungry."}
{"text":"I have worked near the Canyon Cafe since it opened. I had been in once before for a quick happy hour with co-workers, and that was fine - they have a pretty good margarita happy hour deal.

This is the first time I had gone in for a meal. It was a Monday at noon, and the place was slammed. This isn't atypical for AZ Center restaurants when there is a conference in town. However, they had a table for 8 ready to go quickly, which was pleasantly surprising. Despite being slammed and dealing with a table of 8 going Dutch, the service was swift, accurate, and pleasant. 

I had a combo fajita platter - steak and grilled veggies. It was $17, but felt like $30 worth of food. I can eat a lot. I had three enormous fajitas - each stuffed to the gills with steak, veggies, rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, and tomato. I only ate about half or maybe two-thirds of this platter. It was impressive. It was also pretty tasty for this kind of more-casual Mexican eatery. Not mind blowing, but will do for large groups of co-workers or clients. As Yelp says, it's A-OK.

Even with 8 folks on separate checks, we were all seated, fed, and out of there in 45 minutes. I was delighted and impressed. Canyon Cafe will be on my list of potential client spots/business meals from now on."}
{"text":"Nice service and decent environment but the food was meh. Had the fajitas and didn't even finish them because the meat was way too over cooked."}
{"text":"This place has great table side guac!!  Meals are a decent size.  It's been there a while and always tastes good.  I like that the chip basket has an assortment of chip types.  The salsa is yummy too.  Service is friendly.  There are many options for margaritas.  

They have indoor and outdoor seating and room for large groups.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out, not too crowded. It's not a great place to watch sports, but it works in a pinch. Their happy hour is pretty darn good, and their food is almost-passable Mexican for the most part."}
{"text":"Five stars for my fire-roasted veggie tacos.

Zero stars for the heat. My god, Arizona is Satan country."}
{"text":"I work across the street from these folks and eat their food a lot, either on site or catering. The ambience is very nice Southwestern and suitable for a business lunch. The food is really good, especially the salsa, which is smoky and complex, and salads, which are imaginative and delicious.  The white chocolate tamales, which always arrive for free with the check, never cease to delight my guests.  Something that needs work is the chicken breast on the salads. It's usually overcooked and dry. If this were corrected I'd give them a 5."}
{"text":"Great find thanks to Yelp! My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit. 

Next time we go back I'll definitely try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good and probably tastes really fresh."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Sticky floors. The chips for the table came hot and were delicious. Our waitress (who also sat us) was very courteous and attentive, checking in on us regularly throughout our meal. The food was good. They had decent Mexican cuisine; everything was seasoned well and there was a small, but broad selection of menu items to choose from. The kids menus also featured chicken fingers, cheeseburgers, and Mac n cheese in case you have picky eaters like me. The only down side was that the floors were definitely not clean. My shoes kept sticking to the flooring as I walked, like someone spilled a soft drink and it wasn't cleaned properly."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friend while we were visiting phoenix. The ambiance of the place is pretty great. Nice and relaxed and beautiful scenery if you dine on their patio. 

We made the mistake of ordering two entrees and an appetizer because the portions were HUGE. We couldnt finish anything we ordered and had to take at least half our table home at the end of the night! 
Not only were the portions great, but the each bite was so flavorful. We also had a little yelp coupon for a free dessert and were not disappointed one bit! This place was a gem we stumbled on by accident and i wish we could go back for another bite!

Also, they gave us a little complimentary dessert at the end of our meal as well! It was some kind of chocolate and it was exquisite! 

Needless to say, we were rolling down the streets back to our hotel from our overstuffed belliesss"}
{"text":"good fresh table-side guacamole, margaritas were too sweet and diluted, fajitas were good! rice was not vegetarian but beans were.. service was fine.. patio seats were fun"}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  I love that you can walk right in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location?  But the food has always been phenomenal.  The seared tuna and fresh veggies is so good and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great lunch the next day.  Chips and salsa are the best of anywhere.  The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice blend AND sweet potato chips.  Sooo good.  And it's a great, roasted salsa too.  I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good.  I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it.  We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too.  If you love calamari, there's is great.  IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends.  Really.  Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.  Just the perfect little two bites of sweet to finish your meal.  Consistently good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service!

Went for lunch with a coworker, who had never been here before. Both of us enjoyed the salsa and very unique tortilla chips. Wish I had ordered the made-at-the-table guacamole. Prices were very reasonable (especially for downtown Phoenix).

Both of us ate more than we should have. The servings were huge and dee-licious! Way too full to even think of ordering dessert. More reason to return!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I have one word for you, 2 Limit Margaritas!!! Okay, thats more than one word but you get the idea (: 

The free chips and salsa are really tasty and come in a variety of sweet potato, tortilla and seasoned crispy fluffy ones... mmm. 

The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the food. It's good but I felt it was missing something both times I ate there. 
I had the BBq burger and Portabello quesadilla which were a little bland and ordinary. 

If your lookin' for a good, strong margarita though, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Prompt even with long lunch lines. Food is decent for the price. Can't go wrong eating here If you don't want to fight traffic during your lunch break."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside & enjoy an afternoon with a friend, especially since the AZ weather is startin to cool slightly!  There were mostly business types and tourists dining around us.  We chatted over drinks while taking in the water fountains @ the AZ Center and soaking up comfortably warm sun rays.

While waiting for our food, we grazed on chips that resembled a mix of real tortilla chips and some potato puffs that reminded me of Munchos.  Except the things that looked & crunched like Munchos had a slightly sweet taste.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  My plate came with the double shelled tacos with a zesty sauce and a choice of toppings for you to spoon yourself--black beans, spicy coleslaw mix & Spanish rice.  AT the end of the meal, they brought out white chocolate that had been chilled & wrapped in a corn husk.  It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap, if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal.

The only drawback is that the prices are a lil high--$10.95 for my Orange Beso margarita, which was poured @ the table.  (The server left the remainder in the shaker for me to imbibe).  And my taco plate was around $10 too."}
{"text":"Another nice downtown restaurant.  Had the chicken salad...outstanding!! Light touch with the tasty dressing (yeah) but almost enough chicken for every bite of salad. Chips were fresh and paper thin, to dip in the flavorful salsa. Had the ice cream with caramel sauce...so good. Enough to share too. Server Austin was efficient, friendly and knows the menu well.  Wish all servers were as good at their job as Austin. Can't go wrong having a meal here, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"The black and blue quesadilla was amazing! And the chips and salsa are to die for! Service was great, too!"}
{"text":"Reviews don't lie. Our party of seven had no complaints about the food, excellent. Service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. It was lunchtime on a Monday but the restaurant was dead so no excuses not to be on top of things. It took forever to get water and chip refills. From order time until they picked up the check it took one hour forty five minutes....but we did get some complimentary chocolate dessert compliments of the chef"}
{"text":"I was just  visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on  Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! 
I can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!
We were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! 
I will return on any visit to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Theirs guac is amazing!  Just tastes so fresh. Made right in front of yoym and they have some fancy margaritas too!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. LOVE the happy hour! Happy hour is only at the bar area. I'll be frank, happy hour is great because of this bartender whose name I'm still not quite sure of. The several times I've been, I've asked and he jokes around a lot so I'm not even sure. Alex, Al, Carlos, whatever, you're awesome.
Margaritas are strong, guacamole is delicious, wings are awesome and most of all...THOSE CHIPS! The fluffier non-corn tortilla ones and sweet potato ones are my favorite. Salsa is a smoky and dark, unique. Coconut mojito is amazing. 
Unfortunately, I'm moving soon and will miss this place like crazy. Canyon Cafe happy hour, you will always hold a special place in my heart."}
