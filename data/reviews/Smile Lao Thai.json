{"text":"Had our second outing to Smile Lao for our anniversary.  Once again, we had a great meal. The eggplant in red curry and the green papaya salad were perfect.

This most definitely our favorite restaurant now.  It'll be our go-to."}
{"text":"This might be one of the best Thai places I've ever been to and I've been to many different ones. The avocado curry and the eggplant curry are amazing. You'll have to try their egg rolls while your there because they are perfectly made!"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing! Johnny our server recommend great food and was extremely kind. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"REALLY want to love this place but the service is just so so so slow and absent. Also the square plates that they use \"rattles\" on the table - super annoying. As for food, most are full of flavors, especially of the basil. That can be a hit and miss depending on what you order. For example, the yellow curry is so tasty but not green. Looking forward to a better service in the future."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and great to deal with. The food was equally great. Everything was delicious and was served quick. If you are looking for a Thai restaurant that is clean, friendly and will certainly leave you feeling satisfied, this is the place."}

Yelp Review
Smile Lao Thai
2107 S Rural Rd Tempe, AZ 85282 (480) 894-5495

On the first school day of this semester, I was informed by a friend that there has been a newly-introduced Thai restaurant opened near Arizona State University area. Since I am a huge enthusiast for traditional Thai food, where the taste of Thai food somehow matches with Chinese cuisine, I decided to give this restaurant a try. This brand new restaurant is called Smile Lao Thai. which is located on south end of rural rd, approximately 8 minutes drive from ASU Campus or 12 minutes from my apartment. Based on the name of the restaurant, I think this restaurant combine the cuisines from both Lao and Thailand. I thought it might be a little \"novel\" to try. Anyway, the overall impression to this Thai restaurant is fairly well based on attentive staff, reasonable pricing and delicate foods. I highly recommend this Thai restaurant to ones near the ASU/Tempe area. 

I was here during the dinner time after school. The first impression of this restaurant is just so-so because it situated on a normal neighborhood without too much traffic. Also, the outside decor for this dining venues was sort of missing as there were no obvious signage or billboard. However, once I entered this place, I found the interior design very comforting and assuring with plenty of natural lights and wood furnitures. The menu of this restaurant was made of very thin paper, which is sort of vulnerable I think. But I guess some name of the dishes on the menu were not translated in an efficient way, making me confused a little and spending a little bit extra time looking at the menu. Generally, the price here is very reasonable and lunch time offered a lunch special package that contains a soup and a main course. Anyone who wants to save some budget could come at lunch time!

The service at this place is not top notch but definitely worth of the price you paid. The staff here were also very sincere and attentive and smiled just like the restaurant name. Based on their look and accent, the waitress might be from Thai or Lao I guess, but they are also pretty fluent in English. So you do not really have to worry about lost in the translation. Also, they quite understand client's need for getting what they ordered in a timely manner. Thus, all of our dishes ordered were delivered in a very urgent pace. We truly appreciate that since another Thai food venue here was really slow at delivering their dishes.

As usual, I ordered my favorite Thai dish tom yum gum soup, a soup made of spicy pepper and seafood. The taste was not bad, though definitely not as spicy and distinctive as what I normally eat. And for the main food, I ordered a seafood fried rice and a spicy pumpkin basil dish. I found the size of the food here were really courteous and sort-of beyond my expectation except the soup. Generally, the food quality was quite edible and tasty by \"American Standard, though not as spicy as \"Asian Standard\".  Finally, the waiter came over asked if I need any desert, and I ordered the mango sticky rice. Actually, this became my favorite dish as the mango was very sweet and juicy while the sticky rice were really soft and tasty.I finished the whole plate, and I would definitely come back here for this dish again!

I would definitely return to sample more food options whenever I was around that block."}
{"text":"Our saturday night dinner :
Service was slow, our waitress forgot about us so the other waiter took over, and my son had hair in his food ! No apologies, no compensation! 
Not the laos food I grew up with, but ok flavors...just not a very good first time here !!"}
{"text":"Super good service. Lots of variety for the picky eater. We had six different orders and each was excellent. We frequent this great place often!"}
{"text":"I don't believe that I have ever written a review on Yelp, but Smile Lao Thai deserves recognition. The interior was clean and provided a great ambiance for dinner. The food was amazing, some of the better Thai food I have had. The portions were large as expected with Thai food, but upon your first bit you look forward to having the left overs for another meal. The staff and two waiters we had were exceptional. We rode our bikes over with our two dogs and sat outside. The staff was extremely support of with us having our dogs, they used a take out container to create a dog bowl for our thirsty pups. 

The few items that I would comment on do not affect the stars as these reasons did not affect our experience. This restaurant is fighting a very difficult location, I have seen several tenants pass through this space, but I believe Smile Lao Thai will succeed. A sign on Rural would be extremely beneficial and provide traction. I hope they work with the property owner to get something installed. They are also working on getting their liquor license which was great to hear, so soon enough I will expect them to offer a great happy hour menu.

I look forward to many more visits to this restaurant for the great experience/food and support our local Tempe businesses."}
{"text":"Yay!  Finally an excellent Thai place in the greater east valley! 

Having lived and eaten Thai in many cities who actually embrace good Thai food (SEA, SFO, NYC, etc.) and having tried many of the places in the greater PHX metropolitan area (not-so-inspiring), I am happy to report we now have authentic, fresh, delicious, Thai (and other East/Asian) inspired offerings. 

Highlights:
*Good variety on the menu but not overload that they try and do too much, they stick to what they know and do it well.  
*Clean establishment with a nice atmosphere and easy parking/access.  
*Owner and staff who are present and care and make sure you are satisfied with your meal and willing to customize to your taste (heat/spice, vegetarian, healthy options, etc). 
*Fresh food with great flavors and quality ingredients.  Everything tastes (and I believe is made) fresh daily. 
*REAL chopsticks (not the wood disposable ones, at least not in dine-in, small thing but I appreciate this). Nice dinner wear as well.  
*Prices: Reasonable, not cheap, not expensive, just about right and I never mind paying for quality ingredients anyway. 

What Could Make It Better:
*A liquor license (not one now, not sure if planned and I would still go regardless). 
*Be closer to my home (ok, not really something I can influence but obviously we are willing to drive there and past other closer Thai places to eat here). 

Try it out!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some take-out for dinner. We ordered chicken pad thai and basil fried rice with chicken. They lady on the phone wasn't really helpful and didn't explain anything about the spice level. After asking, we decided on level 3(from 1-5) for both dishes. They ended up being really mild, more like a 1. The flavor was still really good though. Also, we were quoted 15-20 minutes and then had to wait an extra 10 or so minutes. 

We will definitely give it a try again for dining in but don't know that we will be doing take-out."}
{"text":"Food is great?Service is good. The only thing I won't try again is the Thai tea. It's way too sweet!"}
{"text":"So good!  We haven't had Thai food this delicious since traveling through Thailand!!  Fantastic service and a nice atmosphere!  We'll definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"We had the Lemongrass beef stir fry, red curry with tofu, and vegetable eggs rolls (and Thai iced teas, of course). Simply delicious with the perfect amount of heat. Beautiful decor inside and very clean."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for both sit down and take out - the quality and authenticity of the food cannot be beat in Phoenix, hands down (and really, is on par with the Thai food you will find in SF and LA). However, some of their dishes are Laotian and quite unique - case and point: the Mii Kathi is one of the most flavorful things that I have ever had. Once the weather cools off, I can't wait to dig into some warm bowls of their soup!"}
{"text":"Surprising long wait for food despite relatively empty dining room.  And the food was not really worth the wait.  The food was basically meh.  Wings and Satay appetizers were OK.  Tom yum pho was OK.  Nam Salad was probably the best dish we had but it was only average at best.  Overall, despite the high ratings that drew us here, I would not come again."}
{"text":"I love the sweet panang curry, the shrimp pork avocado spring rolls.  Dining area is clean and inviting.  Price is very reasonable.  I will be coming back often."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is terrible. The lettuce wrap dish is the best thing I've tried there yet. However, they really need to hire more experienced staff. Not only do the servers not check up on you to get your order, they did not give us napkins or the check without our flagging down and prodding. Who eats lettuce wraps without needing napkins???"}
{"text":"Really like the vegetarian options here. Nice, quiet restaurant with a calm atmosphere, though small. Glad we took a chance and called them--they are not closed as this page indicates."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!
Enjoyed the green curry with tofu; complex flavor was the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I've had in AZ and the Won Ton soup is incredible!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and the food was amazing! Very authentic. The dishes tastes very much like the dishes I grew up with. I will definitely be back. Thank you for the excellent food and amazing service! The staff was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent new Thai Food. 

Was hard to find at first, drove around in circles in the parking lot until i looked over by the subway.

The food was very fresh with Lots of crunchy veggies and whole chilis - no chili flakes like what other Thai Restaurants seem to subsitute for spice. The green curry had a very unique flavor, not as sweet as other thai restaurants here in AZ."}
{"text":"I came in here for the pad thai, it's honestly the only thai food I really like, and I ordered online. I came in and it was done a little early which was nice, and the guy at the front desk was SO nice and chatted with me for a bit. It was slow in there, but I think it was at like 3 PM so in between lunch and dinner. The pad thai was DELICIOUS. Just the right amount of spice (I did level 2 just to make sure) and the noodles weren't mushy they were cooked perfectly. The onions and slaw that came with it were so fresh and crunchy, adding that perfect texture to it. I have never had the slaw added before, but I loved the dynamic it added to the dish. I will Definitely be back here after trying Sai Ba and many other thai places...this one definitely beats those!"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING. Super fresh and beautiful ingredients and lovely sauces. Our was item was very attentive and sweet. He kept our water full and checked in on us frequently. The decor is tasteful and simple. Could have done without the big screen tv distraction, but at least it was closed captioned. We both ordered Laotian dishes ( I had the pad pet, he had the house seafood dish with green curry sauce) and the flavors were delicate and delicious."}
{"text":"This establishment had very tasty food, a basic atmosphere, but very friendly service and very clean restrooms and dining area."}
{"text":"We got back into town late and were looking for a Thai restaurant. We read the reviews for this place and decided to check it out just 50 mins before closing. The staff was really nice and welcoming, even this late in the day. The food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was amazing. I don't think I have seen such good-looking dishes in any of the Thai restaurants that I have been to. The seasoning was perfect for what each of us requested. We will certainly return the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in the service and etiquette of the waiter. I walked in and sitting on the cash register was an open cheque book with a credit card sitting in it in attended. The restaurant only 5 or 6 parties were seated and yet it appeared to be very overwhelming for the young man acting as a server. This probably is what caused him to have lack luster customer service. 

Restaurant is moderately cleanly for the area that customers most frequently traverse. 

I had ordered the shrimp and pork spring rolls and the pad see ew. 

The spring rolls were huge! Easily 2in in diameter. They were open on both ends however and that made for eating messy.

The pad see ew was luke warm and flavorless. Also, the portion left something to be desired for a $9 entre especially when the aforementioned rolls were quite large.

I also found a foreign object in my entre, not sure what it is. Appears to be a large seed of some sort. I will provide a photo."}
{"text":"Ann is back! Delicious Lao/Thai food, beautifully presented. Two of us - one no spice, while I love it hot, thus ordered all at a 2 of 5, and lovely condiments allowed me to satisfy my need for spice. Ordered pumpkin/chicken stir fry, Fried Pompano covered with tasty vegetables and a green papaya salad and all were great. The complimentary salad with two dressings (opted to use both) and the sticky rice/mango desert were tasty preludes and conclusion to a lovely meal."}
{"text":"First off, the servers were so nice and so pleasant, reason enough to go there.  The food was great, I can take the hottest Thai food there is, so I was surprised when I ordered it at heat level 4 out of 5 and it was really hot.  But that's OK, I love it hot.  We will be back, especially when you have beer and wine!  Thanks for a pleasant night out."}
{"text":"5 stars. Just opened up too so everyone should come down and support it, great prices for how amazing and fresh all the food is, and they give you ALOT! Best Thai nearby, beats Thai Elephant and Thai Basil for the same and cheaper prices. 100% 5 stars, come try since its new, once people find out, this'll fill up fast!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere. We were there for lunch and we both had the lunch special.  The soup and egg roll were delicious. I could have made a meal on that. The 2 lunch specials were good. I liked the fact that the veggies appeared to be fresh and not frozen. Will definitely go back! Nice to have options in the hood."}
{"text":"Beware beef dishes are additional $1 eventhough menu does not state this, waitress tells you upon order. I enjoyed the complimentary soup that came with lunch.  My meal was too salty.  Probably won't return, roughly $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place offers great favor and very authentic SE Asian favors. The plates were plentiful and prices are similar with restaurant near by. Ordered the chef specialty fish, beef panage, coconut soup, pad Thai, and bun no hue soup( too sweet in my opinion) all were very tasty. And oh- these were multiple visits, can't eat all of these entrees between two people... This will remain on our list of valley rotations."}
{"text":"My associate and I were in the area and stumbled upon this place and it just so happened to be the 3rd day open! It was a nice place to conduct a development lunch and to also treat my associate to a nice meal! We started off with the fresh coconuts and a free soup/roll that were delicious.  We shared two entrees that were beautifully presented, the drunken noodles and Pad Thai. Both excellent. Right when we thought we couldn't eat anymore the server let us know about their free desert special ! The sticky rice and mango as well as the coconut mango ice cream were to die for! Such a nice experience. Can't wait to take my team back for our quarterly lunch!"}
{"text":"Picked up an order over the weekend, red curry and pad thai. The pad thai was great but the red curry didn't compare with others in Tempe, it actually had a weird funky taste to it. It is in a convenient location and the kid who helped me was very nice."}
{"text":"Got take out from this place a week ago. Ordered Pad Thai and Sweet and Sour chicken. The food was fresh and well made. It didn't have as much heat as I would have liked. The place was clean and nicely decorated inside. I would definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Johnny is always quick to suggest something new. Have not found anything i did not LOVE!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience. Order a to go and it take 30mins to wait on it!! I will never come here ever again !"}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends for dinner. We ordered the app sampler to start which was average. I ordered the mi kathii soup noodle, which was amazing! My friends ordered the pad thai and the pad see ew. All were really tasty and big portions. I would definitely try to make it down for lunch. They have lunch specials for $8! Our waiter could've been better groomed but all in all really good food and great ambiance."}
{"text":"A new Thai restaurant option in Tempe! Love it. I've been by Smile Lao Thai a few times now and had pretty good experiences as far as the food goes. The first time we went, it was for dine-in and the next couple of times, we just got an order to go.

My fiancé dined with me the first time. He got an order of the Avocado Curry and I got an order of the Pad Pet with chicken. Our server told us that their spice levels are more spicy than at other Thai restaurants, so I ended up getting a 1 on a scale of 0-5 with 5 being the most spicy, and my fiancé got his dish at a level 2. It didn't take too long for the food to come out and both dishes smelled phenomenal! Even at level 1, the Pad Pet was pretty spicy. I liked it because the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, and the sauce was flavorful. The Avocado Curry was by far the star of the meal though! The curry itself was thick and creamy, and texture of the whole dish was even more creamy with the fresh pieces of avocado in it. It still had some crunch, however to offset the soft texture with bell peppers and green beans. Spice level 2 was away too spicy for me, and even my fiancé who doesn't mind spicy food thought it was a bit much.

I couldn't get enough of the delicious avocado curry which is why I have gone back a couple of times just to get that! Unlike the first time we dined in, our to-go order have always come with a side salad. We noticed the menu says all entrées are served with one, but I'm not sure why we weren't given salads when we at the restaurant. Additionally, the sides of rice which came with the to-go orders have also been much larger. I think I got more rice for my own entrée than my fiancé and I did for our two entrées combined when we were there! I'm not sure if they charge for an extra side of rice if we ask for more than what is initially served to us, but I imagine they would.

This is why, overall, I'm going to go with a 4-star review. I know the restaurant is still new, so maybe they're just working out some service inconsistencies, but as mentioned before, the food has been consistently really good. We'll be back to give them a try again for dine-in."}
{"text":"I gave this place a chance because I missed dishes from back home and hoped for Smile Lao Thai would fulfill my pallet. When I called in and asked for a question about their menu, the girl was so unenthusiastic, monotone and seemed like she did not want to be there at all and gave me one/ two words answers. Very unprofessional. 

I ordered their green papaya salad and their chicken satay. Both were very disappointing. I asked for a Lao style papaya and they gave me Thai style. Keep in mind there are big differences in taste between the styles since both style uses different ingredients, so you can see why I was so disappointed when they didn't give me what I asked. The green papaya salad was $8-9 a little pricier but Its at an okay price/portion I guess.

The chicken satay was the bigger disappointment. The meat was dry, old, smelled like it was expired, and poorly put together as the presentation was like they didn't even care. Very small portion and an appetizer starting at $9-10; very expensive and very disappointing. I will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, they deliver within a three mile radius for orders over $25. Minus one star because the food took 2 hours to get here, which is probably because I called right at their busiest time (oops) but at least they were nice and very apologetic about it. 

The food was AMAZING. So so so good. I tried the Mii Kathi and Pad See Ew. I usually stick to curry when I eat Thai and decided to try something different. So glad I did. My new favorite place. Next time I will go pick it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  My first time in Phoenix and I found a great Thai place on the first try.   They definitely know how to meet your spice level."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai noodles with scallops. Excellent flavor lots of bay scallops. Good service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the customer service was not. I felt rushed and like they really didn't want my business."}
{"text":"If you would've asked me to rate this place two months ago, I would've given it a solid four stars.

Now, however, that has changed.

It's too bad really, because this place has good food for the most part. It's nothing mind blowing, but it always seemed relatively fresh and healthy. So why the two stars you ask? Well, let me tell you.

The last few times I've been in, I've noticed a rather disheartening sense of unprofessionalism and lack of attention to detail, from both the wait staff and the owner. It started when I came for lunch one day and got a beef curry dish. Everything was good, until I got the check and noticed the $1 upcharge for beef. Not a big deal, but it wasn't listed as such on the menu, and I wasn't told as such. I called the next day and spoke to the manager about it, to correct the problem. She explained they had ordered new menus, and the server should've mentioned it. She said to ask for her next time I was in. 

So next time I came, I did just that. She thanked me for letting her know, and she apologized. But that was it. Now, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but when a owner tells you to ask for her, doesn't it generally mean the intention is to compensate in some way? This was slightly annoying, but it was made worse by me overhearing her talk to a table behind me who had complained, and then offer them free dessert. Why the double standard? Frankly, I felt embarrassed for even saying anything at all. Especially since I was being polite and neglected to mention how the spring roll was cold after she asked me how my meal was.

Okay, so that was a pretty big hit on the score card. I finished my meal with an air of uneasiness, not helped by my server who upon asking for a cup to go to pour my water in, brought a gigantic 44oz cup full of water. I mean really, are you trying to make a point or something? It seemed tongue in cheek and slightly passive aggressive, but maybe that's just me.

This brings us to yesterday. I was weighing in my mind whether to give them another shot, or go to another nearby Thai place instead. I chose the former, and went in a bit after 2:00. I was greeted by the same two servers who are always there, one of whom who insists on calling me 'Sir', even though he's almost the same age as me. Side note: am I only one who thinks it's smug and kind of condescending when people do that? I'm 25, not 50. I'm not a sir. 

Anyways, everything seemed fine at first. I got soup, which even though it was mysteriously lacking the spring roll, I chalked up to a kitchen error. However, when it didn't come out with the entrée, I asked where it was. The same guy server then told me that 'the owner stopped serving the egg roll since it was making us lose money.' Now, I don't run a business, but in my humble opinion, if you are a new restaurant trying to gain loyal customers, you DON'T change your menu and prices not once, but twice within a matter of weeks! To build the expectation, and then suddenly change that expectation is just bad business. And I'm not buying that they're losing money. If you are, you're doing something wrong, because every other Thai restaurant in the area has them, and are in fact actually cheaper on average for lunch.

So, another big hit on the score card. Does it get worse? Unfortunately, yes. When biting into my chicken curry, I pulled a small chicken bone out of my mouth. Okay, a bit gross, but it happens. But the real kicker was this: the restaurant was completely empty when I was there, which apparently means to the staff that they can be as loud as they want, to the point of me hearing all of their personal conversations in the back and upfront. Keep in mind, the owner is engaging in these same conversations. Then suddenly, the music cut out completely half way through my meal, only to be replaced by the guy server's phone music, which consisted of completely cheesy country music and some Irish jig crap. Excuse me, what? This is how I enjoy my meal? That's verrry professional alright! Let's just say, it made for another awkward dining experience.


Although I generally like the food, I'm afraid I won't be returning to Smile Lao Thai. I've been disappointed too many times now, and experienced too much unprofessionalism to return. I just hope they will improve these faults and succeed in the way they should for future customers."}
{"text":"So this place had a weird vibe for us as soon as we walked in- it was near dinner service time and not a single person was in the restaurant. That is usually a sign to head for the hills but we were pretty hungry and therefore, committed. The server was friendly but she really needs to step up her game. It took nearly 10 minutes to take our order and we were sitting 20 feet away from her. We ordered spring rolls and those took 20+ minutes to get to our table. When our entrees finally came out they were warm, not hot. We asked for chili paste and instead of telling us they didn't have any, the server doctored up some concoction of \"chili paste\" and then brought it to the table and said, \"I think that's what you're looking for?\". It was strange, and no, it wasn't what we were looking for. In terms of our entrees- pad see ew and yellow curry- they were pretty good. Nothing noteworthy but not terrible either. Before we left, a woman and her friend sat for nearly 15 minutes before getting their order taken (yet the server had plenty of time to entertain a couple and their dog right outside of the restaurant). I'd eat their food again but the poor service is what will prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"I don't want anyone to know about this place because I don't want it to be busy when I want to go! This place is legit and delicious. Green curry and the fresh spring rolls cannot be beat. The guy that works there is beyond sweet and just adorable! And of course get the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here a few weeks ago. Server was very friendly, but a little slow on the refills. We got the pineapple fried rice, avocado curry, and the honey chicken. Everything was great!  Never had an avocado curry and now I want to know why!  Definite recommend and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I ordered the Green curry with avocado and it was fantastic! The side salad and soup were delicious too. The other people in my party enjoyed there food as well (they ordered red and green curry). The restaurant was clean and the service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Terrible and slow service this time despite their delicious Lao authentic dishes. That's the only reason why I still continue to come here for the past five visits."}
{"text":"Very good thai food. Pad woon sen is my favorite, however they don't make it consistently, it is still good. Sometimes its a huge portion, others its small. Sometimes it has baby corn, sometimes it does not. Not sure what's the deal with that?

The avocado curry is good too, but even at spice level zero, it was WAY too spicy. So that kinda ruined it.

Still, its the best thai food I've had in az, and holds King Title for now.

Minus one star because of the young asian female workers there was VERY unenthusiastic. My friend tried to joke and make her smile, because after all, its called SMILE lao thai. But she would not even crack a smirk. I mean not at all. Like a mean muggin' angry chick. Get rid of her, and hire someone else!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great mood to it; the decorations and lighting create an intimate  feel. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and everything was clean. The menu is full of options and the prices were decent. The portion size was ample.

We spoke with the owner and chef; she let us know she buys the best ingredients and measures each portion carefully. She believes this helps to maintain the food quality, control costs and assists those who are watching what they eat, to stay on track.

I would recommend this restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"This is our go to local Thai place. So pleased. Food is always really stimulating and fresh ingredients, service is friendly, and decor is nice. We only do take-out so far because it is so close to our house, but I do enjoy hanging out while waiting on my order, chatting with the staff. But mostly it's all about the food, it is great. Oh, it's all the way on the west side of the mall, facing Rural."}
{"text":"Smile Lao Thai stands out from the typical Thai restaurant as it's a fusion of Laotian and Thai dishes. Our server was wonderful at explaining this and was very detailed in describing the dishes and the different country's influences. We had the spring rolls, mii kathii and drunken noodles. The spring rolls were delicious and had fresh herbs and veggies. I had never had mii kathii before, it's similar to Tom Ka Gai as it's a coconut curry broth but a little less thick and contained ground pork, peanuts and rice noodles. I love this soup! It was so full of flavor. The drunken noodles were more traditional Thai style and were very good too. I will definitely return to try more of the menu as the service was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend of mine and we were impressed by both the food and service here. I asked the waiter for recommendations in which he did recommend some awesome dishes for us. After looking over the menu I decided on the drunken noodles and my friend ordered the curry with duck. The noodles were extremely tasty and I loved the flavor in the entire dish. My friend also really enjoyed curry and said the duck was very good.

Overall it was a great experience and I would come back again to try some of their other dishes. The people working here are really helpful as well."}
{"text":"Too bad the service is so awful: the food is decent. I ordered pick up and arrived when the time said I should. I went to the front desk to pick up and she had to look up my order Then started cooking. It took them another 30 minutes to put my order together. I can kinda forgive that though it did make me late to an event. Then I ordered delivery. I checked on EAT 24 for the conformation and time frame and waited the 45 minutes after estimated delivery time. After an hour I call the restaurant. No answer. I call back in ten. No answer. Call yelp. They can't get a hold of them. By now they are listed as closed. So I guess they confirmed my order then forgot and closed. Nothing like waiting for food that never shows up. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth and nothing to wash it down with."}
{"text":"wanted to try a new thai place so i decided to come here but i definitely regret it.... i ordered a pad thai and asked for medium spicyness but it actually tasted sweet... so gross!! The worse part is my food had eggshells in it... Who doesnt know how to crack eggs!? Ridiculous!!! I will never come here again and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Ann is, by far, one of the most talented chefs I have had the pleasure of knowing. Her Laotian cuisine is fresh and delicious. The spices she cooks with are authentic and you will end your meal wanting more! 
The Yum Woon Sen, Avocado Curry and Whole Pompano Fish are just a few of the must haves on the menu; and not to forget the desserts she handcrafts upon order. The Sweet Rice Mango and Fried Bananas are beyond delicious and the flavors as colorful as the entrées! 
If you enjoy Asian cuisine, freshness and support local businesses in your community, check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great. The dumplings are wonderful and everything is freshly prepared. It can be spicy so use caution. My new favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular curry then came out a coconut curry but with my super sweet waiter he was really feel sorry he would like to change for us, but I told him No! Well, let me try your coconut curry! Oh my god I love it and all the foods I had are crazy Good! It was my first time visit Arizona and I love it! :)"}
{"text":"Great solid Thai food!  Everything we tried was so tasty and had great flavor.  We had the House sampler platter which I couldn't find any fault in.  The soup that came with entrees was solid.  The Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai were good and I appreciated the portion size.  Some of the best Thai Coffee I ever had too!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A shout out to my new Yelp buddy Karen W. for suggesting and meeting me for lunch here last week. 

This is a newer restaurant in a strip mall that is shared with an Applebee's.  It is tucked away at the side corner right off the road.  There is plenty of parking since its in a strip mall location.  

They offer a lunch special that includes soup and while I didn't get it, looked good and was a generous purchase. 

I got the Pad Pet dish, which is one of the Laotian dishes they offer.  I had never tasted Laotion cuisine before, so I was quite excited to try it. It was served with yummy steamed rice that was sticky and delish.  The flavor was so well balance, it was quite spicy, yet packed with the flavors of the spices and veggies.  The savory flavors really complimented the tastes of the fresh veggies.  I especially liked the texture of the Thai eggplants, they are small and round (green skin) and are a litte crunchy on the outside and full of crunchy seeds, I thougt this really added a dimension to the dish that was unique and new to me. Note that you may adjust the spicy factor, I asked for mine medium and it was quite spicy. I like spicy foods so I can certainly go Thai spicy with it, however I usually try medium the first time to see how spicy its served. 

I would and can't wait to return to try some more dishes. I would certainly give this place a try if you are thinking about it."}
{"text":"The wait is finally over. A small sign said Thai Restaurant opening soon in a small strip mall in my neighborhood. Aside from this small tidbit of information (which indicated that a Thai restaurant was opening) I had no information but today I noticed the new sign which said OPEN! I immediately texted my friends and planned a dinner outing to take place promptly at 6:30 PM. We were not disappointing. 

All of the food was very well presented and delicious. We started with some Thai Iced teas and coffees that were absolutely delicious. Then onto the house sampler which included Two veggie egg roles, chicken stay, fried shrimp rolls, crap puffs, shrimp tempura, and curry puffs. It came with three sauces, peanut sauce, sweet and sour, ... and some other thing that was also good. The hot sauce was extremely fiery and pleasing/burning. There were lots of vegetarian options which were great for the vegetarians in our group! Basically everything was great. 

Although we were all skeptical if we could eat anymore we were seriously considering trying the Fried Banana with Ice Cream dessert. Then the wonderful news came; they were giving free desert. We split the fried banana desert that came with three scoops of ice cream, green tea, coconut and vanilla. In the midst of our excitement I forgot to take a picture but as we promptly devoured the tasty treat the opportunity was quickly lost. It too was delicious and I was quite pleased with a strong finish to our first visit to Smile Lao Thai. I will definitely be back and am excited to have a new dining option right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and Nate was our server, super nice guy! Asked for feedback and he meant it, it was classy. 

As for the food, I had the Mii Kathii (I believe that's how it's spelled), WOW!!! It's curry, and it's peanut sauce, and it's Pho....only it's better than all 3. Dang it, I'll be back!! 

I order 3 hot...and that was hotter than I expected. My friend who has been here warned me their scale is off by a bit. Add a star to whatever you say. They do things hot. 

I normally get a 4-5 depending on the place, this 3 was an easy 4 and when it comes to soup, to hot isn't always fun."}
{"text":"The best Thai i've had in the greater Phoenix area in years.  This place offers fast, friendly service wth a smile.  Each item on the menu comes with enough food to feed two people.  I had the Spicy Lemon Grass Stir Fry with Chicken and it was darn good.  I did ask for extra heat but it tasted like mild to me.  The waiter gave me their tray of hot spices but none of them added the heat I wanted.  Daddy likes his Thai HOTTT and Spicy.  It gets crowded durning their lunch service.  I find it best to arrive around 1:30p-2:00p.  Plenty of parking is available in the strip mall lot.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Elegant presentation, authentic Thai cuisine and super friendly staff. We shared the pot stickers, Pad Thai and Green Curry. Ask for pan fried pot stickers. It's the best! Both main dishes were so fragrant, beautiful, and made our taste buds so very happy. The Green Curry especially had a lovely fragrance of fresh lemon grass. The flavorful Pad Thai reminded me of my first trip to Thailand. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is good if you can get past the awful service. I would not recommend coming here hungry or you will end up feeling starved and upset by the time the food arrives.

I believe the daughter of the restaurant owner is the one that I have had a horrible experience with multiple times. I get the nepotism here but it is going to cost them a lot of business if it continues to be like this. 

Will probably never come again."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've tried so far in the East Valley! The tom yum fried rice and the coconut soup were insanely tasty. So much flavor! I will definitely be back to try the rest of these delectable dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a proper eatery with fresh selections and fair prices. The atmosphere is modern and classy, the owner smiles naturally and is ever present. Rad Na us as good as any I have ever had. The coconut/ pineapple ice cream drizzled with honey is quite unbelievable and is a do not miss!!!!!"}
{"text":"Update-7-25-16

Thanks to the owner who read my review contacted me about my visit and decided that the waiter didn't do his job. You will no longer have the service problem I had at this restaurant. I feel it's only right to up them to a positive Three Stars since the waiter is out of the equation."}
{"text":"This place made us SMILE! Delicious, flavorful food, great service and clean beautiful facility. We got the Pad Thai, Garden Delite and the fresh rolls. All excellent!"}
{"text":"With so many average Thai joints around Tempe, I had become used to the status quo pad 
Thai experience and began to acquiesce to the reality that my cravings for coconut curries and stir fried noodle dishes could be accomodated - but never properly sated. Then this amazing little restaurant opens up less than half a mile from my home. If you haven't tried the Pad Woon Sen yet, I can't recommend it strongly enough: fresh, crisp, perfectly cooked broccoli, carrots, bean sprouts, and green onion stir-fried with egg and glass noodles in savory Thai spices and just the right amount of oil. The dish is somehow both filling and light at the same time. Adding a spoon or two of the homemade chili oil from the little tableside spice rack turns an already flavorful affair up to levels that obliterate all previously known taste standards of good Thai. The portion is huge and could easily feed 2 adults. I usually take half of it home and enjoy a reprise for lunch the following day. I'm beyond addicted and now require an infusion of this miracle dish at least once per week. Since I started coming here a few months back, I've gotten acquainted with the owner, Anne, who is Laotian and adds her own unique twist to common Thai staples. She has been cooking Lao/Thai food her entire life and her passion is undeniable. Smile Lao Thai is most definitely the deep end of the Thai restaurant pool here in Tempe."}
{"text":"Spring rolls tasted and looked very fresh. Tried nam and Spicy Lemon Grass Pork, both were very tasty. Restaurant is very clean and everyone was friendly. I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Had the Garden delight lunch special, which is basically chicken and veggies. It's not my first rodeo with a Thai lunch special, and this one was really good. 
It comes with a crispy veggie spring roll and a cup of sweet and sour soup for $8. 
Everything seemed really fresh and not greasy. The pic says it better, but an impressive amount of veggies in this dish with the perfect amount of spice. The spice level was 1-5, and I said 2 after I was told they're a little spicier than other places. He was right, and 2 was perfect for me. Looking forward to going back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My wife & I never had Lao cuisine before. So it was with a bit of excitement that we decided to stop by for dinner. We are happy to report it earned our recommendation. 

Our waiter was very nice and professional. He was also attentive, yet not intrusive. 

The decor of this restaurant is simple, yet elegant. We were so fascinated by the items in the menu, I forgot to photograph the interior. 

The Wings with tamarind honey sauce were a finger-linking good dish. The tasty sauce was the right combination of sweetness, tartness and spiciness. It even made the fresh side salad tasted so good. The wings themselves were crispy & well-cooked. The meat was moist. 

The Nam is a pleasant surprise. It was a dish made with seasoned minced chicken, tossed in coconut rice and served with fresh green lettuce & mint leaves. I believe the proper way to eat was to use a lettuce leaf to wrap at least a spoonful of chicken rice, and top it with a mint leaf. The combination of flavor and texture of this dish was very good; the round rice cooked in coconut was creamy, yet some part of it was crispy but not hard; the minced chicken was well seasoned. The portion of this dish was a meal in itself, or at least enough to share among 4 people as appetizer. 

The Pad-See-Ew with beef tasted slightly different than the traditional Thai version. Some deep-fried noodles were added for contrast with the remaining soft noodles. The meat was well seasoned and tender. But both my wife & I were too full from the other 2 dishes. After a spoonful, we asked to have it boxed up to take home. 

The owner came out to greet us toward the end of our meal. She was very nice in describing to us the wonderful cuisine of her native country. At our next visit, we will definitely ask for Lao flavors instead of the \"traditional\" (Westernized?) ones. 

Yes, this restaurant earns our recommendation. We plan to be back to try-out other dishes."}
{"text":"We order here at least twice a week. When we dine in we always BYOB/wine. Best Thai in this area."}
{"text":"I had the pad woon san. My companions had the cashew nut chicken and the pad see ew. The pad woon san was ordered at spice level 3 however I felt the pad see ew that was ordered at spice level 2 had more heat. In terms of the food, it was definitely not bad at all, however none of the flavors really stood out to me. The flavors in the pad see ew stood out the most of the three dishes in my opinion. The cashew chicken was probably my favorite out of the three. I felt the green onions really went well with the flavor of the chili sauce. Overall, the food was good but nothing stood out. I would come back."}
{"text":"This place it literally the best. Been here 3 times and each time has been better than the last. Try the pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Great service, ambiance, and food! We tried several dishes, all were  flavorful, colorful and spot on! The price is good for the quality and quantity provided. This place is a must try! My family and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for steering us towards this place! I wanted authentic Lao food on the last day of April to commemorate Lao new year. I was leery of trying a place that claims to have Lao food because I've seen many that have tried and failed due to the complex dishes and foreign ingredients. But this place did it right! Good job!

The service was very friendly and attentive. I believe the owner is also the cook. She genuinely cared about how we enjoyed our food, presentation and experience. 

We ordered the papaya salad, spicy pho, and my favorite dish, nam pork! Yum!! It was the right amount of spicy kick and the flavor was strong and memorable. So good!"}
{"text":"Awfully SLOW service. Been waiting for half hour and finally being told that they just started making my food... and according to other reviews here, slow service is common. And it's really pricy regarding the food and portion. The tofu in my dish was sour, not fresh at all. And I didn't get napkins. I really don't understand how they got good reviews. They did give me 20% off for the long wait, but the food and service prevent me from coming back again."}
{"text":"This place won The Worst Thai food in Arizona. On top of that I got overcharged. I ordered Red Curry which was supposed to be $9 (on the menu) but they charged me $12 instead (Plus $1 if you order beef which the waitress should have informed me, but no big deal). Back to the food, it was not flavorful at all. Veggies and meat obviously wasn't cooked with the curry long enough so it was plain. I barely touched the food. The waitress asked if I wanted a to go box but nah.. I tried this place because they have good reviews in general. Unfortunately they failed me. There are places in AZ with much better curry and even cheaper. If you like authentic Thai food, pick a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Tofu curry is on my top 5 list of favorite foods for sure, but red curry is my fave and it's hard to convince me to order a different kind off the menu. Smile Lao Thai succeeded in having a menu so good that it convinced me to try a different type of curry. There was no way I could resist ordering avocado curry!!
This place is small and a cool little whole in the wall place, I had a bit of trouble finding it, but not too much trouble. The service was a bit slow but not too bad, we weren't waiting too painfully long. 
The avocado curry was so delicious, and a really big portion. I got to choose from steamed or fried curry, and I went for steamed. I probably would have liked fried more, but I wanted to be healthier! I loved all the vegetables in the curry and how creamy it was! It was served with a ton of rice too.
It was a tad expensive, more than curry I normally get, but not too bad at all. Worth it for that yummy curry every once in a while! I'll totally be back, I want to try the pumpkin curry as well."}
{"text":"Been looking for an authentic Laotian restaurant and was delighted to find this place through a search of \"papaya salad\".  Decided to give it a try and so glad I did!  Took my mom with me and she really loved her mii kathii (she can't chew well and this was perfect for her!).  I ordered the nam to keep things light, flavorful yet filling in a hot AZ late afternoon.  Ordered the mango with purple rice for dessert; it was tasty and with 2 mango halves perfect for splitting.  I ordered the papaya salad Lao style (the aroma was spot on, spicy level 5 and they did make it Lao style - much more hotter and pungent than Thai style).  Highly recommend ...from a Lao girl.  It's the real deal!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service fine. I ordered a basil fried rice and a Thai tea. 
I was caught off guard by the amount when I got my bill--$18. Turned out the Thai tea was $5 (!!). There are two different sizes of Thai tea for $3 and $5 each. The server never asked which size I wanted and just gave me a large one. The tea wasn't that great, I only drank 1/4 of the $5 tea. I spent $18 plus tip for a fried rice and Thai tea...."}
{"text":"I went back up to Tempe last week by invitation of the manager. She provided me an apology and a refund for my meal that I reviewed earlier. The waiter that messed up our order has been let go. I was so impressed that I stayed to have some spring rolls and a bowl of soup. She would not allow me to pay for it and invited me to come back. I certainly will! 

The spring rolls at this place are very authentic. Many Thai and Vietnamese places don't always use mint and all the correct spices. The owner and chef at this place prepare some pretty authentic tastes. I was also informed that she is preparing a new hot sauce that she would like to market. 

Come and try and be treated right! The two waiters that were there were right on the money. I will certainly be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I thought the customer service here was fantastic. The lady who helped me was super attentive and very friendly. The food here was really good. I got the Tom Kia soup which had a beautiful flavor and aroma. Their fresh springs were good but not my favorite. I prefer less lettuce in mine and more noodle.    The clear sauce they served with it was Delish. I ordered a side of tofu fried rice and I really enjoyed it. It was a much lighter fried rice and I really enjoyed that. I would go back to try other things on their menu"}
{"text":"I got the fish pad Thai and it was amazing! The plate was full so I had plenty of left overs. I found this spot on Yelp and very happy to say that I have new Thai spot to visit and eat good food. My girlfriend had coconut rice with her meal and was also very satisfied. I would recommend giving this place a try. He food is good!"}
{"text":"So I was torn; the food quality was excellent, really really food food! However, we ordered take-out, and the portions were small compared to the price paid. Also, we ordered two full dinners, yet only got one small scoop of rice. 
We ordered thai boba tea. However, the tea only had a few small Boba Tapioca pearls, and we paid extra for that. 
Would I try the place again? Yes, but not for take out. Don't skimp on the sizes"}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and delicious. I had the Tom Yum Fried Rice with tofu, others had avocado curry, and the beef pho. We loved everything."}
{"text":"I love this place! So tasty. Best Thai food in town. I love the Yellow Curry"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their Lao style Beef Pho and Mii Kathi! Absolutely delicious. The pad see ew with duck is also amazing! Service is always prompt and good, however, I do take out orders 90% of the time.

If you want to try a different variation of Pho that has a good hearty flavor, their Beef Pho (Lao Style) is absolutely delicious. There is a bit more seasoning, some garlic and other Lao style seasonings that made it absolutely addicting."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the pepper steak on their lunch menu. The meal came with sour and spicy soup and rice on the side. It was delicious! 

The interior, including the bathroom, was nice and clean. The staff was wonderful. My server Nate was very polite and friendly! He was so kind to give me a free iced tea, because my order got mixed up and took longer than expected. 

Overall, I would definitely come back and bring my friends for their food and customer service."}
{"text":"Restaurant was very clean in a nice setting playing lao music. The service was great. I requested a lot of little things like diced Thai chilli sauce to go with my pad see ew and they made it for me. We ordered a variety of items from papaya salad, wings, Thai iced coffee, noodle dishes and everything turned out great. Their portions are very large. Love this place and will be happy to come back!"}
{"text":"We had the pot stickers, Mii Kathi soup, Tom Yum fried rice, and Avocado Curry. It was all really good. I would have a tough time picking a favorite. The place is nice and clean with good service. One of the best Thai restaurants in Tempe."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a place like this one. The menu is extensive, however, the best items are not stated on the item. Ann offers sine hang, which is Laotian beef jerky that is paired best with sticky rice. This really is an authentic restaurant, worthy of checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute GEM!! I'm a SE Asian food fanatic and this place is topnotch!! 

The restaurant is very clean and great ambience - greeted with smiling faces of everyone in the front and in the kitchen. 

Our server was very friendly and patient.  I of course arrived late to my dinner and my friends had ordered.  Our server was very quick to get my order and get me my food out. 
I also took the advice of a fellow yelper and got the thai chilis with fish sauce and vinegar - holy hot batman!! It burned so good!  If you wanna add some spice - GET THIS! I put it on top of my Tom Yum Fried rice (which on its own is soo tasty) but with some spice and a splash of soy sauce its on another level. 

No thai dinner is complete without mango sticky rice (purple sticky rice I will add) - just melts in your mouth. 

I also had a few bites of my friends Red Curry - so much flavor it was hard to only have two bites I wanted to finish her plate. 

If you are looking for authentic, flavorful food and service with a smile (no pun intended) I would absolutely recommend Smile Loa Thai.  I will be back... a lot"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Very clean and modern interior. We had the vegetable egg roll, chicken coconut soup (sooo good!), pad Thai and red curry. Everything was so delicious and they had homemade sambal hot sauce. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow. So good! I'm in love with the Tom Yum Pho. Extra spicy per my request, and incredibly flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed. They advertise Lao style papaya salad with crab. I even called to make sure they use crab paste, (the dark goodness) and they assured me they used it. 

I ordered two orders and three small orders of sticky rice to go along with it TO GO 
The total came up to $30!!! I was a bit shocked but whatever, We were all craving spicy hot papaya

We noticed when we got home, they had gotten the spicy levels wrong  and that the crab paste wasn't mixed in, we were 15 mins away. I called them to tell them of the mishap and the young gentleman that answered was unsure of his answers. He then said I could bring it in to have them fix it. 

First of all, it wasn't worth it to drive all the way back. We had dinner set out and we were ready to eat. A good business would have offered to have a new one replaced or at least credited one back. 
Keep in mind, they deliver; well at least they advertise that they do. They should have brought one over. 

He made sure to tell me, \"u can bring it in. We won't give u a new one, but we can fix it. \"

To be honest, i didn't want anything from them. I was just super highly irritated and I just wanted someone to hear me out and pretend to give a sh*t. 
We all hate it when food comes out wrong ESPECIALLY after it's been confirmed before ordering. 

Sigh~~~ anyways, the papaya was decent. It didn't satisfy my spicy craving, but it wasn't completely bad. 
I give the food 3 stars, knocking off 1 star for not soothing my need to feel special."}
{"text":"Very good, fresh Thai food...vegan options available too! Good service and carry out available as well."}
{"text":"Lucky me! What a great find of a restaurant!  I ordered the lunch special jalapeño stir fry and I ordered some spring rolls. Yummy!! You can get brown rice if you want and I also had them custom make my spring rolls with chicken instead of shrimp. The server is a sweetheart! Great customer service. I will be back!! But a word of warning, I LOVE spicy food and I got a 3  out of 5 but with the large slices of jalapeños, wow whee kicked even my butt! But soo delicious"}
{"text":"This place is where I come when I'm missing home. The place is small and quiet, the music is authentic, the food is authentic. 

We got the crab wonton for an appetizer and I have to say, they are the most scrumptious ones I've ever tasted. I've tried a couple at different places but they didn't have enough filling in them unlike these. Delicious! 

Wife got the laab salad and she totally destroyed it! It was a little spicy for her, she got 3/5 spiciness but she needs to learn to eat spicy if she wants to stay with an Asian lol 

I got the Mi Kathii. Delicious!!!! Such a huge bowl! I couldn't finish it all sadly. 

Overall, this place is great. The food is delicious and the owners are super nice!"}
{"text":"The owner has sold the restaurant. Food is undercook, along with the fact that they either add too much salt or too much sugar to each dish. The smile Lao Thai restaurant that I've known and loved is no longer there. I won't be back here again. Even the desert doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, Recommended if you want to try something different!

Food:
I enjoy Thai food, and was curious about what Laotian food would be. I was excited to see this new restaurant that combines both cuisines, so I stopped by for an early dinner. I was impressed with the menu, and had a hard time selecting my entree! With some help from the staff, I finally selected a Lao dish: Mii Kathii. This is a soup made with rice noodle, ground pork, peanut bean sauce, red curry, coconut milk, and egg. On a scale of 1 - 5 I ordered \"4\", and it was plenty spicy without being over the top. It came with a good selection of condiments too: mint leaves, shredded cabbage and carrot, sliced raw chili, bean sprouts, and a lemon wedge. They also brought Sriracha sauce, Hoisin sauce, and a couple different kinds of chili paste. 

This dish is reminiscent of spicy Thai chicken and rice noodle soup, but without the fish sauce (I think). It had a nice balance of spice and flavor, and the egg added an interesting touch. The only down side for me was the rice noodles were a bit soft. According to the chef, who came out to chat, I can ask for the noodles to cooked less next time.

I also had a Thai Tea, which was very sweet and flavorful, as you'd expect.

Cost:
The Mii Kathii was $9, the Thai Tea was $3. Especially considering the size, I thought this represented good value. Oh, and they offer one free refill on the Thai Tea! And they currently offer complimentary dessert - I had the Mango Slice on sticky rice. It was very sweet, but a nice finish to my meal.

Service: 
When I arrived I was the only customer in the place. The staff were very attentive and, as I mentioned, the owner and chef, Ann, came out to see how I liked my meal.

Atmosphere:
From the outside, at the end of a strip mall, it doesn't look like much. They're so new, they don't even have a proper sign up yet. But the interior is attractive and clean. 

Overall:
Definitely a smile-inducing experience - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second time around! Johnny has a good memory, he remembered me from my last visit months ago. We got a booth and ordered crab wontons, since I raved about them from last time. Still just as tasty. I choose a different entree this time, the sweet panang curry with fried tofu and it was delicious. My spice level was a 4 and it was perfect for me. I appreciate the prompt and friendly service at this restaurant, especially since my friend had her toddler with her and Johnny was thoughtful and brought him a kids water cup and a side of rice."}
{"text":"Every dish here is so tasty. This time I got avocado beef curry and papaya salad with shrimp. Avocado curry was creamy and sweet with the favor of Thai herbs. Papaya salad was refreshing and brighten the day. Last time I got the coconut soup (Tom kha kai). The soup filled with finely chopped Thai herbs and coconut broth was a smooth mix with the heat and the favor."}
{"text":"Visited on new year's day for lunch.  Had the wide noodles with chicken and spicy #2.  The basil and the crisp veggies was delicious flavor.  The sweet thai iced tea was a great compliment.  Also had the chicken pho, which was good but I wouldn't go back for this dish alone.  It came with the standard veggie dish which included cilantro as well, which was a good addition.  The 2 servers were nice and attentive.  The parking is plenty and the inside is small but chic and clean.  They had large tvs for conversation avoidance!!"}
{"text":"Food was so tasty!! We stopped in to try something new on a Friday night and what a great choice this place was. The ambiance was so cute for date night and our service was excellent. We ordered pot stickers, a hot pot of Tom yum soup and the drunken noodles with beef. The soup had such a different flavor compared to others that we have tried and it was fantastic! The drunken noodles were great and our server offered us a spice rack which made our noodles even better. Great experience and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice and clean. Service was excellent. The servers were attentive. Food was great and it was authentic Lao food. We ordered mi Katii and nam. Excellent. Just like eating at home with out the prep or clean up. We'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great find in Tempe! Super friendly and attentive staff. I had the green papaya salad American style (no fish sauce) and it was very fresh and a large portion. I had the grilled salmon with brown jasmine rice and steamed veggies for my entree and the salmon was off the chart! The chef grilled it in a banana leaf with salt and pepper and holy cow, was it good!! Moist, flavorful, a hint of spice from the pepper, and the chili garlic sauce I put on it added a nice spicy dimension. The brown jasmine rice was perfectly cooked and a huge portion. Steamed veggies were good but nothing special. But that salmon!!! Wow!!! The owner told me they had only been open 3 months. So go support good local Thai food!!! Well done!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here a few times. Each time it has taken over an hr to deliver (orders were placed at peak times) BUT that being said, the food is definitely worth the wait. I have tried several different dishes ranging from traditional curry to seafood fried rice, to pho and nam. I have made special requests like adding a fried egg on top or tofu to a dish that doesn't typically include it. Each time the quality of the food, freshness of veggies and scale of spicy-ness has been stellar. Hands down the best crab puffs you can get. I moved here from a place that had phenomenal Thai places to eat and was pleasantly blown away by this food. It's a bit pricey but the portions are large,(usually I'm able to get 2-3 meals out of a serving). This BY FAR is my favorite \"go-to\" for Thai. Staff is also very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Smile, because you'll be eating delectable dishes if you eat at Smile Lao Thai! I drive by this area all the time and had never ventured into this part of the shopping plaza until I saw all the lovely photos of delicious food here on Yelp. It's a small little restaurant off to the side a few doors down from Subway next to a pawn shop. They are still so new that they don't have official signage up, but don't let that stop you from enjoying their menu!

The restaurant is beautifully appointed with serene accents of dark wood, lush purple and jewel toned green. We were greeted warmly by the chef/owner who was also multitasking today as our server and we had our pick of comfy booths and tables.

The menu features a tour of various Southeastern Asian cuisines, with Thai, Vietnamese, and Laotian dishes. We had the vegetable eggroll appetizer and shared a tom yum fried rice and pad pet. The appetizer was decent, with cabbage, glass noodles, and carrot. It was fried until golden brown and served with a sweet sauce. The chef, upon hearing I like to kick up the spice level, brought out a condiment tray with sweet chili sauce, savory chili sauce, sriracha, and soy sauce. Awesome! I loved the combination of the different chili sauces with the sweet dipping sauce the rolls came with. 

The dishes were a lovely sight to behold, with unique vegetables you typically don't see in your usual Thai restaurant such as Thai eggplant and beech(?) mushrooms. The tom yum fried rice was amazing, with tender chicken, vegetables, and the bold tom yum flavor running through the rice. I enjoyed the pad pet as well, a Laotian red curry dish, and I was excited to try a taste of Laotian cuisine. We talked with the chef, and it was clear she holds a lot of pride and passion in presenting real Asian cuisine just like you would eat if you were visiting one of the countries represented at this restaurant.

I also indulged in a rich, almost syrupy Thai coffee, a strong potent elixir that was smooth and had a perfect amount of sweetness. It was served iced in a large glass that was satisfying to drink with our meals.

Our total for the iced coffee, appetizer and 2 entrees was a little less than $30.

Stop by and try them out. They have lunch specials right now for $8, and this is probably the only place in the Phoenix area where you will find a true taste of Laotian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I came here late on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead, but when I entered it was very clean and every one was very nice. It is visually appealing. And the music is very relaxing. I got the chicken ginger pad king.  It was very good just right spicy. It also came with a small salad to start off things. I got my food quick and it was just right in all regards. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and this was my first time here. We were a party of 4 and everyone's order was wrong. Server assured us they were working on correct order. 20 minutes later the owner came over to see what we wanted and only then did 2 of the orders get corrected. The 3rd order was not remade they tried to fix it. Not edible the 2nd time. The owner was terribly rude and was making excuses for the wrong orders. As a restaurant manager the service was unacceptable. I will not be back. As a side note a couple had ordered Togo  food by phone. Same server who was waiting on us forgot to put order in so they were forced to wait for their food. They need work on the service."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! If you like authentic Thai/Loas food and spicy heat, this is the place for you. They have unique dishes that come from Loas that I used to eat as a child and could never find or recreate. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent especially for our party of 12.  2-3 waiters were constantly helping us. 

The best thing was this place is a BYO so we picked up wine/ beer at the liquor store. 

The food was delicious and we ordered a lot. We've been to Thailand so know what good Thai food taste like and this place gets a strong Yay.  

Please try."}
{"text":"It is no wonder this place has 5 stars! The food, atmosphere, and service is outstanding. I had the Tom yum fried rice and for dessert I had stick rice and mango. I loved everything I ate! I have been to Thailand 3 times and am I regular Thai food connoisseur. :) this place exceeded my expectation."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 because the food is delicious. I've had their pho, pad Thai, and pad woon sen. I haven't had thai food this good in so long and I've tried so many around the valley. BUT they lose a star because I was completely disappointed by their customer service. I waited 50 min for my fresh roll appetizer! I almost left and would have if it wasn't for Isaac, the server that wasn't even my server but continually checked on my mom and I as he took care of all his tables. I was willing to deal with the horrible wait because of his charisma, his humor, and his overall exceptional customer service. The reason I returned was for the food and customer service I received my first time there with Isaac. I was disappointed that he wasn't my server this time but I truly valued his care for us even though we weren't his responsibility. I hope the manager takes notice at how wonderful and valuable Isaac is to their establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and service!  Ambiance is simple but classy,  very clean.  BBQ salmon was a perfect complete meal.  Pad Thai was very good. Chicken satay was wonderful!   We had the coconut pineapple ice cream for dessert and it was delicious.   We highly recommend this restaurants"}
{"text":"Went here with a meetup group.  The restaurant is on the small side, and tables were full so our service was a little slow--but the group I was with was nice, so it wasn't a problem.  And the waitress apologized over and over.

I ordered the Pad Gra Pow (Sweet Basil) with a #2 heat.  They rate heat from 1 - 5, with 5 being the hottest.  The heat was right on, and I was happy with it.  I had shrimp with it.  There was an ample amount of shrimp and I was able to get brown rice too.  That always makes me happy.

I also ordered iced tea.   Upon leaving I asked if I could get an iced tea to go.  I usually do that when I'm leaving a restaurant.  I have never had a problem getting one to go (unless the restaurant doesn't have to-go cups), but the waitress I asked had a problem with my asking.  She said to me:  \"our cups are huge.\"  So I said:  \"fine, I'll take a huge one.\"  So she filled it to the top with ice and then half full with tea.  I wasn't happy with her attitude or the tea to go.  I dumped half of the ice out when I got outside, so I had a cup half full of ice and tea.  That woman needs to get over someone asking for tea to go...just do it!

I don't live in Tempe, so I wouldn't make a special trip to go here.  Food was good, but there are a lot of other Thai restaurants around in my area, so I'd just go to one of them."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the very first time. It's a gem!
Had fresh spring rolls, Chu Chee fish and Tom yum Pho. Everything was aweaome but the fish was simply divine."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in town. Good and quick service. Order the pad Thai or the Mii Kathi, can't go wrong, delicious!"}
{"text":"'That's what I'm talkin' 'bout'. ,,

I was spring loaded for disappointment when I was the first customer to arrive in the late afternoon.
In 15 years, I had not yet found truly authentic Thai in the Phoenix area.

The Beef Salad was as good as I've found anywhere in the country.  Not cheap, but they use the very finest ingredients, perfectly assembled, and made for a VERY special experience. The salad was ALIVE with magical, authentic flavors

This restaurant cares about 'authenticity' and they know what that word means!  

Yesss!
I'll be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I came here excited to try the food, I ordered the sampler appetizer but it was so super salty and not enjoyable. I had their avocado curry dish and it was pretty good. The pad Thai was a lil dry, the server was not too people friendly and hung out and text on her phone. I got pretty annoyed by the fact that she kept handing out dishes to us over the bannister we sat buy. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Incredible Thai food. The atmosphere is great for either lunch or a nice dinner date. Service was friendly and prompt. The food took just long enough to know that they were actually making it fresh for you. We had the pot stickers as an appetizer and Pad Thai and it was insanely good. Oh! And BYOB!"}
{"text":"great customer service .  I love the padewsew (flat noodles). nice portions and great flavor.  desserts are also large enough to share.  I would definitely return to satisfy my craving for noodles and sweet sticky rice with mango."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night as we celebrated two birthdays.I felt that the $14 dollar sampler platter was a little skimpy for the price, but our main dishes were great. The Yellow curry, Avocado curry and Sweet Pa-Nang curry were favorites. They also gave us two complimentary deserts for the birthday people. The service was very pleasant and prompt. We will go here again and soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new Thai place out so I went with my boyfriend and ordered the red curry with tofu & pad thai. Both were pretty good, but I was expecting a little more based on the very positive reviews I saw."}
{"text":"Best food and best service! Had the Pad Thai. Large portion and delicious. Johnny (our server) was amazing! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Such complex flavors! I love the Song Sa Hai, it comes in a traditional clay pot. I added an order of sticky rice and Thai tea. The owner makes it in house and it was wonderful. I suggest you try both of the items. On a separate occasion I have had many of the items and can't wait for more!"}
{"text":"Two words to describe this place (BEYOND PERFECTION). I cannot believe how good their food is! it tastes like something you've truly never tasted before. I am addicted to their chicken satay and veggie spring rolls. Oh and my favorite dessert, fried banana with ice cream. This place is by far my favorite restaurant in Arizona. Five.. Freaking... Stars."}
{"text":"I had the Pineapple Curry Fried Rice and it was not up to the expectation and the quantity is not much. Its good for a quick meal and with no expectations. My friends had pad Thai with tofu and it was really good. GOOD for Vegetarians."}
{"text":"Amazing chef at this place!!  She can really show you authentic Thai food!  Excellent service from Johnny and lovely people."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food here. We are kind of surprised not many people came in for dining. We ordered pineapple fried rice, pad thai with fried tofu, and a green curry with beef. They are all served with large portion and tasted very nice! The pineapple fried rice is a bit sweet because of the sweetness from the pineapple and cranberry. Pad thai is also a little bit sweet, but I really enjoy the noodle served with lemon and the fresh cabbage together. The green curry with beef is really hot and spicy, but the flavor  is just right and rich. In addition, we had a really good service tonight, maybe because there were not many customers:P Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but have have discovered their take out policy. If you call in an order, they won't start making it until you arrive. I like this place but don't like how they operate"}
{"text":"I gave this place five stars last year because of the quality of the food and the friendliness of the owner. 

I revisited this place today and my own experience had an 180 turn. 

I was greeted upon my arrival which was nice. I was told they just switched the owner two days ago. I was surprised but still decided to sit down and see what's going on. 

When I placed my order, I was told they were out of several items, I mean c'mon, you guys just open and you don't have everything in stock?

Water was served without straw, which is a minus. 

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup, which is traditional Thai hot and Sour, but all I can tasted was sugar.... another minus. 

First highlight came with the server brought the big bowl of soup without serving spoon, how am I suppose to serve the soup to my own bowl?! Amazing right?! The servers answer was the kitchen couldn't find any because they just open....... before she came back with this answer, the server actually had time chatting with another customers for five minutes, didn't care about my table at all!

When my entree was brought to me, after I literally just took one bite of the food which was tasty at all, the check was presented right away........ I mean what was the hurry? I was even asked if I need to go box, it felt like they are  just really trying to push the customers away. Very bad customer service.

Or did I mention there were only two tables total but it still took them 20 minutes to cook the soup?

Overall, unauthentic food, bad customer service. Will never come back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this gem right in our back yard. Great apps good soup and great curry will back back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm probably never going back to this place. I read the reviews and was very excited to try it. I got the chicken pad Thai, a typical dish I order at almost every Thai restaurant I go to. It was horrible- noodles were seemingly plastic and it lacked the \"Pad Thai\" flavor. The dish was oily and it tasted strange and completely off. My friend got the stir-fry broccoli with beef. When it came out, it looked completely drowned in watery sauce and tasted off as well. 
I could not finish my plate so I took the rest to go, and it was extremely difficult to even finish these leftovers as the taste was so wrong, almost sour. 
The service was ok. Nothing special, but the restaurant was nearly empty anyway. 
If you're looking for good Thai food, I recommend going to Thai Basil just down the road. I consistently get great food there."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I got the veggie Pho and it was great. Extremely clean with a nice vibe. I will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is actually really good.  I was struggling to find a pho place on Yelp in Tempe and wound up basically spinning the wheel on this one and it didn't disappoint.  The food was ready for take-out on time.  When I got home and started disassembling I was surprised to find several ingredients and the meat was already in the broth.  It was really good; tangy and not too sweet (I really don't like sweet anything), decent portions of noodles, greens, and meat.  My only comment (not really worth dropping a star off the review) is that the meat seemed to be a bit thick and marinated in something or maybe this is what it tastes like after sitting in broth for hours.  Super clean inside and the place was packed when I arrived on a normal Wednesday night.  This is best you can expect in Tempe so consider this a solid choice.  Next thing I wanna try is the avocado curry!"}
{"text":"We eat a lot of Thai food.  Stopped at this place on a whim.  Not disappointed!  I had the Pad Prik King (spicy green beans) and the girl had Fried Rice.  Food was fantastic and on point!  Our server was Johnny and he was just great and enthusiastic.  See you again soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this place! Had the jalepeno shrimp egg rolls and fried wontons. The eggs rolls were good, super fresh and spicy!! The wontons were too crispy, I liked them but my friends thought they were over done.

I had the stir fried udon noodles - so so so good!!!"}
{"text":"I searched up Lao food on yelp and came across this place. My girlfriend and I love Lao food. When we first walked in, we admired the decor. We also loved that there was a pokestop nearby. The food was delicious and our waiter also gave us complimentary ice cream for finishing all of our food!!! I had some questions and the waiter immediately asked the chef for me. I love this place so much."}
{"text":"When I was looking for restaurants nearby that were still open, I spotted this place.  After I read Rashmi's review and endorsement, I knew it would be good!  I was not disappointed.  The avocado curry was delicious, flavorful, and seemed relatively healthy.  I definitely had enough leftovers to take home (but note the avocado curry reheated doesn't really taste that great).  My boyfriend ordered the pineapple fried rice, which I kind of liked even better than the curry!  They had a lot of stuff on the menu, so we're looking forward to coming back and trying more.

The purple sticky rice dessert was pricier than other Thai restaurants, but it was also quite a bit larger than most other restaurants. So keep in mind that it's made for sharing!

The servers were friendly, but also seemed a bit overwhelmed and maybe a little confused with keeping track of which tables ordered what.  They were really trying their best though."}
{"text":"Little Thai place in Tempe. Friendly attentive staff. Have a somewhat limited menu but good choices. Was not impressed with their lunch specials so we ordered off of the regular menu. If you're in the area there are many places to choose you might want to check this out or try something else."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was very glad they had lots of options for me to try. I had the ultimate asparagus, because, how can you turn down the ultimate asparagus? It was great, as was all of my friends' dishes. For opening day they were also giving away free dessert. That too was delicious! 

The good
- amazing food and drinks
- very friendly service 
- vegetarian friendly 
- fast service 
- clean and modern design 
- unique dishes as well as classics

The not as good
- No alcohol (yet?)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Very high quality. They got my order wrong due to a computer issue, which was forgiven once I tasted what they brought me. Great service."}
{"text":"4/12/17- Update- Today i ordered the Pad Ped. It was  really good!  Almost as good as the Pad Prik King.  If you love Thai, you really need to check this place out. I think it is my very favorite Thai restaurant ever!!  

I love this place!! i go for lunch and i have been there 2 times. It is never busy and it is tucked away on the side of a strip mall. The first visit i order Mii Kathi because of the reviews i read here and i was not disappointed. It was spicy and yummy and very filling. Next i ordered their lunch special of pad prik king w/tofu, which i love, but loved their's the best!! it was sweet and spicy and delicious. I think it was the best tofu i ever ate.  i will definitely for a regular there for lunch. I can't wait to try some of their other dishes.  Servers here were attentive and nice."}
