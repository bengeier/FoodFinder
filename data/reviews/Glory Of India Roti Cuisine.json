{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and decided on this nice little Indian restaurant while my laundry was drying.  I was met by a friendly man(whom I think is the owner) and ordered a butter chicken combo ( I know I know, but I'm a white dude..... And we love our butter chicken)  It was fantastic !!!!    I was back the next day,   Having dated an Indian girl for over a year, I know the food, and these guys are nailing it at an affordable price !... Cheaper then the competition I might add."}
{"text":"So far this hole in the wall spot at Queen W & Lansdowne is the best Indian food I've had yet in Toronto... I'm not an Indian food expert but I LOVE their Butter Chicken it's amazing, I crave it all the time...  I had a convo with the chef who informed me that the rice is super aged basmati rice from India & he marinates his meats for over 13 hours...I believe. Either way, the LOVE is there. Great food, it's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, however the establishment is far from clean. Have eaten here a couple times and it is not consistent. Employee was nibbling at food while it was being prepared and then coming to the front and dealing with money and such without washing hands, and then going back to prepare. I also had to wait 30 min the first time and the 2nd time 20min, not a big deal, except they kept forgetting to bring things and I had to keep reminding them. Though I got to say, they are all very polite and pleasant."}
{"text":"I come from Singapore, lived in Sri Lanka, and I swear by this place as being the most authentic Indian curry you will find downtown. Their curry is a cut above the rest;  layered and complex. North american curry is dumbed down; this spot hasn't tempered it's recipes [yet] to suit the mild-tongued, and I hope they never will.   Sorry, but if you're looking for a non-spicy butter chicken, don't ruin it for the rest of us by complaining to them about it being too 'hot'. You just need to earn your stripes and understand what curry is. Their butter chicken is deep, with pre-roasted chicken, spiced and aromatic, versus bog-standard tourist recipes that omit the step for a milder flavour. Don't wuss out, order it Asian-level spicy, and embrace curry for what it is."}
{"text":"Glory of India is quietly offering up some of the best Indian food in the city. After years of visiting Mother India I decided to branch out and try something new among the Parkdale Indian restaurants.   The risk was worth the reward. I haven't spent a great deal of time in India (I travelled there for about 5 weeks) but the food and the people were my favourite part of the trip. Glory of India offers both. Extremely friendly, informative staff and excellent, flavourful and authentic food. I ordered a thali-style veggie combo with mutter paneer, sambal, chana, pakora, biryani, roti and other delights (for only $8.99). I highly recommend it. Also the chai was delicious.   I will definitely be frequenting this place from now on!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name or the sparse decor fool you, this place is much more than just another roti shop in Parkdale. Here, it's the combos that shine. Essentially you get get a full thali - which allows you to try several of the different delicious dishes on offer - and can choose the meat (or veggie option) and the style (tikka masala, butter chicken, etc.) for your main dish. I highly recommend the samosas as well - so good (and even better with the mint sauce... worth the extra $1 or $1.50 for that for sure)!   This place has become a staple for delicious take-out on a regular basis, and since it's just around the corner I really hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"We went for the first time last night, because a week or two ago I walked by and smelled something delicious wafting out. Not fancy but bright and clean, just getting started, and the location at Queen and Lansdowne is best if you're walking. My husband's butter chicken combo dinner and my chicken vindaloo combo (ordered with medium heat) were excellent! Finished with masala chai, which may have pushed me over into being too full...We were impressed with the friendliness of everyone and we went home happy and satisfied.  Update- we've been back 4 times since I posted my review and both the food and the atmosphere are consistently great! Chicken vindaloo, medium...YUM! Low key, local, lovely!"}
{"text":"I ordered from uber eats. It was suppose to be chicken roti, but when I was eating , I noticed there was no chicken at all , just potato and sauce , kind of a let down , plus I just ate bread and potato for lunch , awesome !  I will not be choosing them as an option again that's for sure ."}
{"text":"Delicious food and generous portion. I ordered the veggie combo. It came with chick peas in a delicious sauce, the spinach paste with cottage cheese(one the tastiest I've had), a dahl soup (with a nice touch of curry leaves), rice, pakora(freshly fried), roti and I asked to have gulab instead of rice pudding. Great deal - only $8.99!"}
{"text":"I want to give glory of India a 3.5 but I'm new to yelp. So I'm trying to figure it out. Anyway I got glory of India off Uber eats and I got I believe the sagg paneer combo that came with rice another chickpea dish and a roti with a veg pakora and a nice little rice pudding which I really enjoyed ( really good texture). I think glory of India was good nothing I would go raving and ranting about but was still good and would definatly eat here again. It came to my door fast, tasted good, filled me right up, for 8.99( which is great) . So overall, if youre in the area and if you want something for a good price that is satisfying this is your place."}
{"text":"Love the food from Glory of India. Full of super authentic flavor. Love that even the mildest curry tastes amazing. Glad to finally have great Indian cuisine in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Incredible food and the kindest staff. Veggie dishes were delicious and ample. Definitely recommend! Best Indian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it at first glance, but decided to take a chance. Veg combo is suitable and tast enough."}
{"text":"The best Uber Eats I have ordered thus far. Curry chicken roti wrap is large and very tasty. Nice and spicy,  this is comfort food for sure and totally worth the $9 price tag."}
{"text":"Really good food! Saag was great Chana masala was great. The garlic naan bread was thin but soooo good."}
{"text":"I've been there about 2-3 times now and I must say I am immensely happy with the choice of Indian food choices we are getting in the area.   This place offers the same quality of ingredients as their competitor Mother India across, but for lower prices overall (and a different taste, but they're both good in their own way). I had all the usual classics I like in an Indian restaurant from this place and so far I have nothing to say, really.   If you pick a certain meat combo you can have it cooked from a choice of probably at least 5 styles! I was picking lamb and I could have had it tikka masala, vindaloo, and probably 4 other things I don't remember! This restaurant doesn't offer other stuff like desserts or samosa/pakora, but that's ok since they offer quite a choice of dishes and that's what they're good at, so you can trust them for that.  Anyway, I am highly supporting these new-comers. They seem like good people (unless their kids are there to make us feel sympathetic :P) and their food is really proper and clean, not too fat or oily, the heat selection is good (I like my spice so I'm not afraid to go hot!), and the fact that they offer so many different styles of a main ingredient is very enticing, all that for a few dollars less than Mother India. Give these guys a boost!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to neighbourhood take-out. The curries are always tasty and the portions are generous. We love supporting this local family business."}
{"text":"I always order their butter chicken on plain basmati rice, it's absolutely amazing!! I've tried mild and medium for spiciness; doesn't matter both are so good. Get both roti & rice with it. Also their butter chicken roti wrap is super good too. Obv get a side of plain rice."}
{"text":"Alllllll of the food I've ever orderes has been so out-of-this-world that I think this has to be ny favorite Indian resto in the city. No exaggeration! It really is a must have. Please try their samosas and biryanis... and everything."}
{"text":"Oh my god! The owner of Glory of India I believe has been harassing me on YELP for the past few months like a psycho ex girlfriend for my honest review. I had no idea who it was first, now I figured it out lol How pathetic. Instead of doing this, how about washing your hands, not licking the spoons/spatulas and putting back into the very dish he's cooking. Disgusting.   It is not like I went there again, he keeps coming back to this page and reading that someone called out on this disgusting behaviour, so instead of taking this as a constructive criticism he can't get over it.  Check this out please. http://imgur.com/a/mdvX1"}
{"text":"I'm actually convinced that every positive review on yelp is by someone who works at Glory of India, because if you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine and roti, this is probably the last place you should go.   The butter chicken sauce comes out of a jar, guaranteed. The curry sauce is far too oily, and separates in between bites. These are just not good dishes.   I grew up with Indian and Pakistani friends, whose families often invited me for homemade dinners. I have gone to just about every descent Indian restaurant in the GTA with these same friends. This is far and away the worst I've ever had, and the only reason I tried it in the first place was because I accidentally ordered from this place and not another restaurant in the immediate area, which is the realest joint in the block."}
{"text":"The Butter Chicken was the yummiest I have had in Canada. The authentic gravy taste and flavour was different and much better than what is being served in other Indian Restaurants here. I definitely recommend it.  I loved the saag paneer too. Its been months I have had ghar ka khana (authentic Indian home food) and this reminded me of that.  Looking forward to visit more often and try everything."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favourite roti place in the city!! Look out butter chicken this place really holds it own on flavour portions and all else! Price point for portion is great considering we always have leftovers after we get take out here and price wise you get a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is the best food  I ever had in Toronto,the butter chicken taste is can't be described,I suggest everyone to have your own experience..!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious for a takeout spot. I would not want to sit in the restaurant and eat though it's not nice to take a friend too and eat.  Biggest reason for the 3 star rating is their prices went up significantly in the past month. They stopped including rice or roti in the price of your dish as well.  They put out a new takeout menu in June and by the first week of July refused to honour the 10% off offer on the cover of the takeout menu even though there was no limited time offer legal disclaimer and the flyer was new.  Not a great way to retain customers doing all those things within the same four week period."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim as we were searching for roti in a hungry frenzy. This place does Indian style roti (as opposed to the West Indies type).  Glad we found this gem. Tasty, huge portion and cheap.  Recommend any time of the day! Try the spinach potato roti"}
{"text":"After moving into the neighbourhood, I was really looking forward to eating at Mother India, since its sister restaurant, Ghandi Cuisine, was our go-to place for reliable curries.  Unfortunately, Mother India didn't live up to the expectation (review on why is  under Mother India).  Thankfully, though, across the street is Glory of India, which is much more worthy successor to the mantle of Our Favourite Local Indian place.  They have a comparable menu to Ghandi, and although I'd say that Ghandi still reigns supreme (and nearby Bacchus Roti, actually has better roti), for anyone closer to the west end, proximity to Glory makes it the better option.  I appreciate that they are very flexible with heat levels (mild, mild-medium, medium, medium-hot, hot), which Ghandi dabbled with and then retracted, and they are happy to take phone orders for pick-up (they've got a fair amount of seating if you want to eat there).  Flavourful, amply-portioned, and well-priced."}
{"text":"First time at this parkdale gem! Really great find.  We are huge Ghandi's fans but live in Parkdale, so not within walking distance. We tried to fill the void with Mother India but they always seems to come up short, good but not as satisfying as the Great Ghandi himself. Now we've found our Parkdale roti spot! Cheap, super delicious.  Glory of India is the best place in the hood for roti for sure, and the combo plates come with so much food for so little $$ its too good to pass up. Check it out."}
{"text":"I'm British so I'm pretty fussy about my Indian food. This was ... not great. Some of it was ok. The daal, for example, was quite nice and the rice pudding was delicious. However everything else tasted like a microwave meal. It all kind of tasted the same ... the Korma, the tikka masala and the aloo gobi- not very fresh and a bit like it came from a jar. The roti was strange, more like a tortilla.  I wouldn't eat here again, unless I was just having dessert, in which case I would eat ALL the rice pudding."}
{"text":"$19 for mango drink and butter chicken wrap? Stomach felt uneasy, much better roti/curry around.  Counter staff friendly. Interior clean, too expensive for mediocre meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken roti and the sauce had too much water in it and didn't have the best butter chicken flavor in Toronto. It seemed to have less cream than I was expecting. It did have a lot of chicken which is hard to find around here. Overall it was alright. The service was top notch. Price wise it's on par with everything else in the area. I'll give it another go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, every SINGLE TIME!  Two visits and two perfect meals. I have had their veg thali on both occasions which was hot, delicious and oh so satisfying.  Must visit!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala plate was really good (and really spicy, so be sure to ask for mild) and came with a bunch of different vegetable sides.  Not going to lie, this place is located in a very run-down area that really didn't seem safe while we were walking around at night. We were starving from our drive from Toronto though so we had to stop here."}
{"text":"Part of me is a little afraid to post a review that isn't four stars. I read the previous reviews so to be honest that might have sky rocketed my expectations.  My love of Indian food started when I spent a few years with an Indian family. Boy, did I learn alot. Did I ever learn to appreciate it's complexity. I can still smell the food cooking in her kitchen or watching them mix the spices to make tea.    Ever since then I have been searching for  cuisine that matches that experience.  I ordered the butter chicken combination that came with a smattering of other items to try.  I had read that the butter chicken was spicy but suffice to say, not at all. Rather the opposite and lacking depth of flavour. One of my faves, a veggie pakora, including in this tasting was burnt. That made my palette very unhappy.  Now the surprising highlight of my meal was the rice pudding. Can you believe that?  It had all the complexities people would describe in their main entrees but here in this simple dessert - I found a little piece of heaven. It was fragrant, sweet and had just enough tooth to the rice that I ordered an additional serving.  Now, on the upside. It's a clean establishment with enough tables to hang out and eat in. Like any establishment, some days aren't as perfect as others so maybe another time my opinion would change."}
{"text":"Finally an Indian restaurant that listens to requests to make it Indian hot. Ordered the Massala Potatoes, Beef Vindaloo and Yellow Dhall.  The flavours were distinct and even though delivery was rapid it did not taste like a lot of other Indian delivery: same curry sauce with boiled meat dropped in it.  Came with roti which was delish and still warm. Went beautifully with the spuds and beef. Had enough left over for 2 meals and the rice was very generous and well cooked and I still am going though the first container.  WIll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Wtf! I ordered lamb and saag paneer roti from uber eats. 30 minutes post eta delivery for the food, I finally received my order. Biggest disappointment- the paneer roti I ordered was not a roti! Came in a plastic tube, no roti or naan. What happened?!???  Also- we order saag Pannel (roti, ended up being just the dish) and lamb.   In the paneer dish, there was probably 3 bites of paneer, the remainder of the dish was potato. Same with the lamb dish.   Would never order from here again. Butter chicken roti and mother India have MUCH more cheese/meat fillings compared to glory. Simply incomparable in terms of quality and quantity for price. Do not order from glory!!!"}
{"text":"I am not an expert in Indian food, I just know what I like. My family and I loved this place. All four of us got the platters and they were a lovely range of tastes and colors (see Geraldine G's pic). The platter had rice, roti, the meat entree, daal, rice pudding, a pakora and a chick pea dish. The menu photos on here don't do this food justice. The decor was basic but the staff was very hospitable and the prices were great. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"By far, the most unprofessional place as far as restaurants go!  Decided to have food from here this evening. Went online to see if we needed to order for pick up or delivery and the website seemed unclear on whether they were going to deliver or not even inspite of asking for a buzzer # in the order form.  We called the restaurant over 12 times only to get an an answering machine! Guess that should've been our cue.  We placed the order and received an email saying the order will be available for pick up! So we start getting ready and jump in the car to get the order only to find the place..you ready...CLOSED!  Their website, Facebook page & Yelp showed it as being open!  Thank god for the diversity in this city as we were able to order from another place right away and pick it up!  Terrible experience! @Yelp - Please work on updating the info.  Never again!!"}
{"text":"PS. If you like cauliflower, try the chili gobi. It's deep fried cauliflower dressed in a sweet chili sauce. Pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered off of uber eats , fast delivery delicious food tasted fantastic, the butter chicken wrap roti is the best, i've eaten here a few times and you can never go wrong, delicious tasty and provide to you something different from ordering pizza..."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I tried during my stay in Toronto. Excellent flavor, decent portions, and all at a very reasonable price. I ordered the veggie combo so cannot comment on any meat items.  The restaurant is clean, spacious, and the owners are very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Chicken saag was nice and flavourful. Just the right amount of heat at medium.   My only complaint is that the \"garlic naan\" menu item was actually thinner and more flatbread-like than I'm used to for naan. It was a good amount though, more than one dish can handle.   Everything is still delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city. Everything's fresh and delicious. $9 for a huge veggy thali, you can't go wrong. So far I've had the saag paneer, dosa and pakoras and all three were fantastic. Can't wait to try more of the menu"}
