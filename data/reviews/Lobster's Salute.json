{"text":"They don't seem to have the $9.99 value meals any more?  So I picked up an 'introductory offer' Maine style lobster roll for $12.99 instead - and it was delicious and very good value, with a decent amount of lobster meat.  They mix the lobster with the mayonnaise, fresh to order.  It has to be one of the better values in the GTA.  Have had lobster rolls downtown that have costed about 50% more, that weren't this good.  Hope they keep their costs down, and the quality up, so that it will stay a standout of the GTA!"}
{"text":"This small little restaurant tucked in on highway 7 opened recently so I decided to try. The owner of this place was really friendly. He made us feel like we belonged. I had ordered the taster combo 1, which was a cool lobster roll. The combo comes with a lobster roll, a side of fries, and a small coleslaw. The coleslaw and fries were quite tasty. The lobster roll was also quite good. It is a bit small but you pay for what you get. The reason I am giving this place a two stars is because, although I did not find any in my roll, my friend who came along found a piece of green plastic string in her lobster roll. She had ordered taster combo 2, which was a warm lobster roll. If this problem was not present, I would not hesitate giving this place a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5 stars for solid and fresh lobster roll at a decent price and very friendly and helpful staff. The lobster sandwich is definitely worth a try IMHO and I would do it without the coleslaw/fries. There's room for improvement, but I'd still come back to try other items in the future.   Food: The menu had a few options that revolved around, of course, lobster. I opted for the \"taster\" size because of lunch hours. Honestly, I felt bad if I was going to spend over 15 dollars at lunch for a roll, where you're not being served by a waiter. The taster combo comes with coleslaw, fries and a drink at just under 10 dollars.  The main star of the dish was of course the lobster roll. I had it warmed and spicy. I drizzled lemon all over the meat. It was nicely buttered with large chunks of lobster, with a light kick to it. Yesssss the first few bites were delicious. I ignored the whole \"wonder bread\" aspect of the roll, because I figure it's a cost-quality ratio. If you have a nice bread, you'll get less lobster, or more expensive meal overall. For this reason, I give the lobster sandwich 4/5 stars.   I will harp on the coleslaw, as it was a bit bland and not all that exciting. The fries were nothing to write home about either.   Service: I came for lunch and found the restaurant to be inviting. The staff greeted me and introduced me to the menu. They were very friendly and I really appreciated this.  Atmosphere and Ambience: The decor was fine. It was simple and clean. That said, I felt like it was for a quick bite only, obviously not fine dining. The food is served over paper plates and I get the feeling there's a cost-saving situation going on. The important thing is that the roll and lobster quality is not compromised at all.  There's ample seating for sit down dining. You place an order, seat yourself and pick up the order when it's ready, sort of situation :)"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because it's one of the only lobster roll places in Markham. It's a pretty small store located at the strip mall beside Service Ontario.   The store front is really simple and the menu had a variety of lobster rolls (cold and hot). We got the Maine lobster roll and the original lobster roll. I preferred the original lobster roll. This place is pretty pricy but makes sense cause they are serving lobsters. I'm giving this place 2 stars because there wasn't enough lobster in the rolls I got. And the flavouring wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I love supporting small businesses in my neighbourhood so I really wanted to enjoy the food at this place. The restaurant looks like it is run by a family with the parents working in the kitchen & the twenty-something kids are at the counter taking orders.  The place is clean and the prices are fair (considering it is real lobster).  Like I said, I really wanted to like the place & hopes it does well but there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the actual food.  I ordered the Maine style Lobster Roll Meal which came with a side of coleslaw & fries and a Lobster Bisque which comes with garlic bread.    Lobster in the roll could use more seasoning - all it had was mayo, the roll itself was too much bread & didn't taste fresh even after it was toasted.  Coleslaw was not good at all.  Just cabbage & mayo.  They need to use a real coleslaw dressing - it isn't too hard, there are dozens online.  Also, the portion size could be a little larger - I've had Costco samples bigger than what they gave.  Fries were OK.  Lobster Bisque was bland and thin.  Again, I think they need to Google some recipes to get the right flavour.  You can't just put some lobster meat & soup stock together and call it Lobster Bisque.  There's certain seasoning spices needed and it should be a thicker, denser, consistency.  The Garlic Bread was also mediocre - the bread must be from the same place the got the Lobster Roll from.  If the food was better tasting I think the price point is fine.   I think they do use good quality lobster so I don't mind paying for it - they just need to improve their recipes/cooking methods."}
{"text":"It is what it is, a $9.00 lobster bun. Fair price for the quality and size. Add $3.00 for soft drinks & fries, the fries is unexpectedly good crispy on the outside and still soft inside."}
{"text":"First time visited here. The inside looks better than a regular fast food shop. Checking in at Yelp gives you a 5% off anything you ordered over $10. I ordered a regular lobster roll, and a lobster bisque with a slice garlic bread.  Lobster Bisque is creamy and tastes delicious. It is not on the salty side which I prefer.  Lobster roll, the roll is like the Chinese style bun, slightly sweet and blends well with the lobster meat. There's quite plenty of lobsters meat inside the bun and the sauce that goes with the bun tastes good. I will come again."}
{"text":"Overall it was a pleasant dining experience, but I wasn't wowed by the food itself.  Service was very friendly and nice.  Food: spicy lobster roll and warm lobster roll.  The amount of meat to bread was disproportionate.  I probably should have gotten the sweet bun instead of salty bun, as there was too much bread on the salty bun.  Also tried the lobster bisque, it was ok, but I literally scared it down bc I was afraid the hot soup would melt the styrofoam bowl.  Interior: nice and clean, modern, take out set up.  Price: a bit steep for the quality, but not by too much.  Overall, I think I will wait a while before coming back, seems like they are still in the soft opening phase."}
{"text":"I happened to bike over here for the first time this week and I really love their lobster, where else can you find delicious fresh tasty lobster for only nine dollars? I was a little shocked by the fact it was only wrapped in a piece of toasted wonder bread, based on the photos that look like a fresh homemade bun and then will it serve to you it's just a piece of wonder bread, I'm not kidding. However the delicious lobster taste and texture and the great service more than made up for it. Thank you."}
{"text":"I came to this place when it was fairly new and I didn't have a really good experience. The restaurant was completely empty when I went in and the owner was pretty nice but he also seemed pretty pushy. He recommended the cold lobster roll, which we got, and we also got a lobster bisque and a dessert. It's pretty pricey for this place but i guess because it was lobster then it kind of makes sense (?) When we got our food we were disappointed because the portions were SO small. It came with like 15 fries and the lobster filling was so underwhelming. The flavours were pretty good though. The lobster bisque is the only thing that I would say was worth the price. However, I see this place has some good ratings so maybe they made some improvements and I wouldn't mind coming back here to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Clean and simple restaurant. Food is excellent. Staff is friendly and service is wonderful. Must try!"}
{"text":"The lobster role was delicious and I enjoyed every bite but if this place intends to survive they have to offer better value.  $10 is a perfect price point for lunch but there is nothing I hate more then leaving a restaurant still hungry.  If they offered their bigger role for $16 with fries and coleslaw as well I believe that would be the right amount of food.    I would love to see this place succeed, it is family run by some very nice people.  I hope they can find a way to offer better value because I would not be willing to spend $25 to fill myself up for lunch.  Giving it 4 stars because of the family friendly service and the quality of the lobster meat."}
{"text":"There are room for improvements.  Lobster bisque - OK, not sure what I expected but it was ok...  I tried the cold and hot lobster roll - both were $14.99 and comes with coleslaw. I prefer the hot over the cold lobster roll. The lobster were fresh that they tasted sweet. The bread they use is on the sweet side which sort of masked the flavour of the lobster. I'd have to say the lobster tail is quite big for the regular size lobster roll. Coleslaw was quite decent too.  The price is quite high for lunch that wasn't very filling. The lobster quality is there but everything kinda of falls short even for the price point.   Interior is modern bright and clean. Kinda small with a few tables available to sit. The employees are friendly and helpful as we had a few questions about their menu. Limited parking available."}
{"text":"I got a warm lobster roll and a cold lobster roll.  Both were bland.  Also got the hot milk tea and it wasn't good.  Price was average and service was good.  But I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Fair warning, the parking for this place is on the smaller side. There's parking behind the building and I strongly recommend you back-in when you park for easy exit!   I had the classic cool lobster roll and it was bursting with flavours. It was just lobster and butter but they did something to it which makes me want to come back again! Their coleslaw on the side is refreshing and cool (perfect for summer!). I would definitely suggest getting a combo because their fries are super crispy and well fried. I also ordered the heart warm lobster roll. It was very delicious when I had it. If I were to choose one of the two, I'd go with the heat warm lobster roll. The sauce mixed with the lobster is amazing!   The cashier at the time was very friendly and kind to me! She also recommended these two rolls as well since it was my first time there. Overall the experience here is nice. I recommend that you sit there and eat for the whole Lobster Salute experience!  Side note: i wish they had more of was the coleslaw on the side...it's so good imo. Definitely compliments the meal"}
{"text":"If I wasn't renewing my vehicle registration at the Service Ontario next door, I would not have stumbled upon this new restaurant. Specializing in lobster rolls, lobster bisque, and lobster salad, the restaurant is still in their soft opening phase. The owner tells me that the lobster roll recipe is based on the recipe from Luke's Lobster which is famous for their delicious lobster rolls. Lobster is sourced from Canada (yay!). I ordered their classic cool lobster roll in the taster size ($7.99 vs $14.99 for the regular size lobster roll), plus lobster bisque. The taster size lobster roll was served in a Dempster split top bun with chunks of cold lobster meat served with warm butter on top. Unlike some lobster rolls, I appreciate the use of fresh lobster meat and the omission of fillers like celery or mayo that take away from the sweetness of the lobster.  The bisque was creamy and had a good amount of lobster flavour but also clearly contained some tomato paste based on the colour of the bisque. As it is still their soft opening, the owner was receptive to feedback (such as suggestions to omit lemon juice from the garlic bread, which left a disarmingly sour taste in my mouth). It's worth checking out this small restaurant at least once if you're into lobster meat. The restaurant itself is small but nicely decorated. As one would expect, lobster comes at a price but arguably a price reasonably paid for freshness."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit at Monster's salute. First time was on a Sunday and they are closed on Sundays?! Hope they open on Sundays after their official opening as most people only get a chance to eat out or try new stuff on wk-ends.   This time we tried the warm lobster and shrink roll (2 orders). Lobster and shrimp was delicious!  However the roll is small and salad was tiny. Fries are OK but not any better than other places. For $9.99 a meal,  I'm not filled and got hungry quick. I understand that lobster is expensive,  but they could offer large size for few dollars more. Drinks are $ 1 extra. They could have offer a value combo meal includes a drink. No water served neither."}
{"text":"We had the hearty warm lobster roll and lobster linguine.  They were flavorful and fresh.  The service was great; when I told them they got the order wrong, they quickly checked and rectified the matter."}
{"text":"I had the Hearty Warm lobster roll and the lobster bisque.  The roll came with coleslaw in a tiny paper cup.  The lobster meat was sweet and succulent, and the hot lobster sauce took the roll to a greater height.  The lobster bisque wasn't thick and rich enough, and the garlic bread that came with it didn't have much butter and garlic.  I love lobster roll with overflowing meat, and I'd rather they serve the meat in a smaller bun.  Would I come again? Yep!  Would I have the lobster bisque again? Nah!  Will try their classic cool in my next visit. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5 stars.  To fairly rate a lobster roll joint, the price point must be part of the consideration.  I rate Lobster's Salute 3.5 stars, because at CDN$15, the freshness of the lobster meat is impressive.  The meat is sweet.  The roll is warm, soft and inviting. I do agree that the portion will leave some gentlemen not satisfied.  Maybe the roll itself can be more substantial or filling?  Note that the lobster roll in the combo is a \"taster\".  The roll has meat of one lobster tail.  The regular lobster roll has meat of two lobster tails, admittedly small tails.  I really like the impressive lobster rolls I ate in Cape Cod.  I paid US$25 (2015 price) for a roll with 1/3 pound of chunky lobster meat, plus a fries, at a roadside diner/shack (actually it was a trailer). I hope Lobster's Salute would consider adding an extra large lobster roll on menu for a higher price.  Yeah, I expect the item would be the same price of a steak dinner, but hey, lovers are gonna love!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I got the hearty warm style which I believe this is Connecticut style lobster roll - it is warm and the sauce is great! They actually put a fair amount of lobster in the sandwich for the price (lobster aint cheap!). I ordered the taster, which comes with fries and coleslaw - the side dishes were nothing special. I didn't quite like the bun that came with the taster - I don't think this is the traditional roll and there was too much bread relative to the lobster (I would prefer a smaller piece of bread with less crust for the amount of lobster that was given). Overall, would come again!"}
{"text":"I walked by after buying food for my boyfriend at Golden Horse and was attracted by the lobster aroma. After dropped off the food, I decided to take my mom to try Lobster's Salute. Her and I are big lobster fans!  We ordered the following: 1) Maine Lobster Roll - $12.99 2) Hearty Warm Lobster Roll - $14.99 3) Lobster Bisque with Garlic Bread - $4.99 4) Mango Smoothie - $4.99  Prices were decent, but for the quality, it really wasn't worth - especially because we were still hungry after. It's a far way from a Buster's Cove.  Lobster was pretty bland and tasteless on both our rolls. There were nice chunks of lobster in there, but it wasn't the freshest. Same with the bun, you can tell with the hard surface.  The lobster bisque was the biggest disappointment of them all. It seems like a home recipe that needs a lot of improvement. It was too watery to be a bisque, and there were no lobster meat in there at all. I would suggest getting a big can from Diana's Seafood instead (no one would know :)  Here are my reasons for the three stars rating: 1/2 in support of small businesses, 1/2 for accepting AMEX, 1 star for clean and bright area and 1 star for quick and friendly service. Unfortunately, aside from the Mango Smoothie that my mom thoroughly enjoyed, we were both disappointed with the food overall.  Freshness is hard to upkeep if your turnover isn't high enough. And to be fair, Toronto is very sad for seafood afterall."}
{"text":"Came to this cute and cozy lobster roll restaurant for lunch. The decor inside is more modern than how the store looks from the outside. Friendly service is always a plus. I ordered the winter combo $8.88 for a lobster bisque and a mini warm lobster roll as I was not that hungry. The lobster bisque was pretty good; less salty than typical lobster bisques so you won't feel thirsty after. The lobster filling in my bun tastes like the lobster bisque but with bits of lobster added. It was good but not wow. My friend ordered the cool lobster roll combo. He found the portion a bit small for the price. Overall I like that their food is not as salty and greasy as typical lobster roll joints and is on the lighter side, but their portions may not be enough if you are hungry! I think I will give this place another try!"}
{"text":"I went to Lobster Salute last week and I tried the Maine Lobster Roll and a Taster hot and spicy Roll and fries with lobster sauce. I went in with such high expectations since it is so close to where I live and I am a huge lobster lover. I was very disappointed at the food for $15 what i got was a piece of bread the size of my palm and maybe a tablespoon of lobster mixed with mayo. If you are looking for a good bite DO NOT EAT HERE. the fries with lobster sauce tasted like some gravy that was bought from Wal-mart. Friendly service but TERRIBLE food.  will not be returning."}
{"text":"Lobster's Salute is a pretty new place. Been wanting to give it a try.  I ordered a Lobster Roll (regular roll) for $14.99 and upgraded to a combo for an extra $3 which came with a small side of coleslaw, fries and a soft drink.  I had it prepared 'Hot & Spicy' with medium level spice.  I'm a bit methodical in the way I eat, so I eat things in order. I started with the coleslaw which was good. It's not something you'd dislike, but not something you'd be wowed by. With that being said, I think with slight tweaks, it could be something that could sneakily stand out.  The fries were next. Same with the coleslaw, they were your standard french fries. Though quite crispy. Just to take it to that next level, maybe some cajun? Just to give it a small kick.  Now, the Lobster Roll. I have to be a little critical because Lobster hasn't been the same for me since I went out to the east coast. And since then, lobster has never been as fresh and delicious tasting. Lobster's Salute is no exception.  I can understand paying $16+ for Lobster rolls are reasonable, but it either has to be larger amount of not as good lobster masked by seasoning or topped with melted cheese maybe baked in an oven. Or it has to be the freshest cleanest quality lobster that will make heads explode even with smaller portions. Considering that Lobster in the GTA may never be that good, ever. Going with the former, and making it a more hearty option might be a good idea.  Overall, it's good, but not $20+ good. However, I love lobster and will at least return to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I didn't know that Alex's Shawarma place had closed down and this place popped up! I happened to discover it on the what's hot list and made a decision to come try it!   Lobster's Salute is a small shop serving lobster rolls, shrimps rolls and lobster bisque, to name a few of their items. Their menu is not extensive, which I feel contributes to the overall quality of the food they put out.They also offer 'value meals' which are pretty much just combos.  We tried out the bisque and lobster rolls; one hearty and warm, and the other, hot and spicy. The hot and spicy lobster had a nice kick to it and was overall very satisfying, and the hearty warm was... well, warm in terms of flavour haha! The lobster bisque was quite aromatic and packed some flavour, but it could have used a touch more salt to bring out the flavours of the lobster. My only complaint would be the portions for the fries and the coleslaw that came with the value meal, but it was still a satisfying meal nonetheless.  Overall, for their soft opening, I think that they are doing great, save for some small back-of-the-house issues, but I think that as they move towards their official opening, they will do well!"}
{"text":"The service was a absolute 5 Star, but the food... Not only was it super pricey, the food it's self wasn't what I expected.  I got the combo; lobster soup and lobster sandwich. The sandwich I got was the size of my palm but the soup was quite filling, soups portion is slightly bigger that the Tim Hortons soup.  I understand that lobsters are not cheap but there is no reason overprice these items...  The soup was not good. There was this mixture of a lot of cream, yet a lot of water mixed together. The lobster sandwich on the other hand, that was good. Of course it wasn't so over priced, I would totally get it again.  The service and the cleanliness of the restaurant was 5 Star plus!"}
{"text":"Hearty Warm Lobster Roll Combo ($9.99) was tasty. I love their crispy fries with the perfect crunch but not oily at all.  Since they uses the small lobster tails as filling, the texture is not as bouncy and firm as some pricier lobster roll. You do get what you pay for. But the taste of lobster is intense and I really enjoyed that.  And for the $1 drink, I highly not recommend their hot drinks especially lemon tea. The tea had been made quite awhile and it has this bitter taste and was so strong!  I will be back when I have craving for a quick snack. But as that price point, not too often."}
