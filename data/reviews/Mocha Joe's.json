{"text":"Perfect. 

I've found the last breakfast joint I'll ever need. Fantastic place all down to the last details; whimsical menu, house-made jelly, even the thrift-shop coffee mugs. 

And most important: The food was LEGIT good and original- not just average diner food. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Excellent food, and very clean and neat. Lot's of choices for food combinations, and reasonable prices.  Newly opened in Nov,2015.  House made Jelly is great.  A filling, hot breakfast and great coffee for under $10.   Do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"Sweet little restaurant with cute decor. The wait staff was friendly and very familiar with the menu options. The homemade apple butter was tasty. I was surprised to find the Sexy Spuds, a staple and highly recommended menu item, to be cold. It was as though they had been prepared much earlier and sat waiting for someone to order them. 
The chorizo gravy was delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff - very nice and attentive waitress in Megan - the day we stopped in for our first visit was the week they changed owners so new menu. 
We didn't know any different as it was our first visit . 

Western omelette was tasty - filled with peppers onions ham AND sausage - wheat bread was so good I thought it was probably made in house - the coffee was hot and true diner style although the fresh milk for it in a mason jar style was classic! 

The breakfast redskins sealed the deal for us - baked smashed then fried so baller!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. 

We ordered a lot of things so we could try stuff. 
Blueberry pancakes were delicious - we often hesitate to order blueberry pancakes when we are out because often they aren't cooked in the center but they checked these by peeling back the center and they were perfect. 
Cinnamon French Toast was amazing. Simply delicious!!
Homemade jelly was good. 
The sexy spuds were full of flavor and yummy!!
Very good coffee as well. 

This place is far from where we live, but we will be back!!

PS - the only problem we experienced was the service. The people were friendly, but not on top of things. I had to ask for silverware after we had food and I had to ask for coffee refills, which I don't like!!"}
