{"text":"This place has a good environment, it seems cleanlier than the other pho restaurants. The food is really good for the price and it tastes authentic to asian cuisine. The pho bowls and the vermicelli dishes are to die for. All the servers here are really nice, and have amazing service. They're really cool and have an amazing aura to them. Overall, I have an amazing dining experience every visit here and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good hearty bowl of pho."}
{"text":"My friend has been bugging me to go to picko lime for the longest time. Firstly, because it was in Vaughan and I live downtown where I am surrounded by a bunch of Pho places. Secondly, when I saw photos of the food I really had second thoughts about going. As weird as it sounds, I thought the place looked TOO NICE to be a good pho place.  When I finally went, I decided I was completely wrong. The place was clean, looked very nice, staffs were very nice, the menu is quite big ranging from appetizers to Pho, Bun, rice dishes and vietnamese beverages.  We had Nem Nuong and Summer rolls for appetizers. The peanut sauce was thinner than I would have liked it to be but it was flavourful. The appetizers do come in quite small servings but the taste was very satisfying. I cant really compare the taste of their nem nuong to anywhere else in Toronto because the last time I ever had nem nuong I was in Vietnam. But it was very tasty.  Same goes with the summer roll. I quite liked the fact that it wasn't stuffed with herbs. It wasn't too over powering.  For the main dish, I had Pho Dac Biet. The broth was amazing. It doesn't taste like it had a whole bunch of MSG in it like at most pho places. It was light yet flavourful. Their beef cuts were thicker than most pho places and was very fresh and tender. The rice noodle used here is different too. It is not as wide, it actually reminds me of the noodles I had in Vietnam.  The size of their pho is really big too. Usually I order a large. My friend warned me and told me to go for the regular because it is quite big. And it really was. The regular was as big as a large in other places. So while the price is a little higher here than other pho places, the serving size is satisfying. This is probably the best pho I've had ever since coming to Toronto. The missing star is for the fact that there will be no pho as good as the ones in Vietnam and for the fact that it is so far away from me!!"}
{"text":"Love Bun cha Ha Noi! It is tasty! Really recommend to try if you dont know what to order"}
{"text":"Service- We were greeted right away upon arrival. Didn't wait long for our food. Very clean place including the washroom. Automatic soap and towel dispenser which was a bonus.   Food- I ordered the pho sirloin which was excellent. The broth was clear and tasty, a tad salty. The meat was good quality. Mango salad was the best I had in a Vietnamese/thai restaurant. I highly recommend it! It was sweet, tangy and a little bit of a kick of spiciness. Perfect! I will order it again. The spring rolls were larger than usual, filled with minced pork. My son enjoyed it very much. Definitely worth the price. The most surprising part of our evening and was well appreciated was having the cook come out to greet us and ask how the food was.  I think that is excellent service and the restaurant is all about their customers satisfaction.  Like I mentioned to the cook, I will definitely return and order the mango salad. Look forward to trying new dishes at Picko Lime such as the curry chicken. I rate this place 4 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Great place, a little difficult to find, but right near Vaughan Mills Mall.  The mango salad was delicious.  The soup and noodles were great and the black sesame ice cream and dip fried vanilla ice cream were to almost die for.  Prices really good.  Janice Grant"}
{"text":"First time here tonite. My friend and I were really impressed! The place is clean (no typical sticky floors, table and menu like most viet places). Even the washroom was clean! The staff was friendly and accommodating to our food preferences (no onion/scallions for my friend, and broth change for mine). The plating was nice. We also got individual bean sprout/basil plate, lime with a mini chili (the whole plate was very fresh too i might add)!  We ordered spring rolls (1 pork/1 veggie), they were tasty and not oily (especially an hour before closing where some places redeep fry - not here)! We ordered 1 house special noodle and 1 chicken noodle. Regular size for both. Portions are quite good. The house noodle had quite a generous portion of meats and the broth was good! The chicken noodle had also a generous portion of meat. White meat, was used and was very tender!   Too bad we dont live near Vaughan or we wil be here all the time!!"}
{"text":"The best of the best. Clean & modern pho. Friendly service. Amazing food, tasty and VERY CLEAN. Chef walks out from the kitchen to see if customers are enjoying his food! Much respect."}
{"text":"Tastiest pho ever and I have tried years full of pho. The dessert, deep fried ice cream as more than expected. It had been rolled in the most tasty cake that was  pastery chef worthy,  it was than encrusted  with corn flakes before fried. A wonderful contrast and relish dessert in its entirety. The salad perfectly balanced so your pallet never gets bored, sweet, zesty and refreshing.    As for the restaurant. Very upsale and super clean. The prices are beyond reasonable and service amazing. Your getting a high quality experience and more importantly chef without the upcharge for it.   Wonderful....Mmmmmmm!  Thanks for such an outstanding effort."}
{"text":"Really really good pho!! New place that opened on Rutherford road! Our server was Nate and he was very helpful and had a lot of recommendations! We went for the sirloin and brisket pho and totally devoured it! I've personally been a big pho fan and this place definitely satisfied my palette! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Location: Inside one of the plaza's located just north Vaughn Mills Mall (on the south side of Rutherford). Picko Lime is kind of hard to locate because of all the businesses in the area. It's a north facing shop on the south side of the middle plaza. (Here are the exact Google coordinates: 43.828081, -79.537275). Ample parking space!!  Facility: Up to date modern decor. The minimalist design and exceptionally clean space makes Picko Lime a slightly more upscale restaurant for Vietnamese cuisine. The design leads into the washroom which is spotless. Motion activated lights, automated sink with water at the correct temperature, soap and paper towel dispensers ensure a hygienic experience. Venue itself is small and cozy, but enough to accommodate the customer flow in the area. There is even an old photo of owner and chef Tony in the hallway washroom from his younger days in the kitchen!!  Food Quality & Price: Dishes are a dollar or two more than your typical Vietnamese restaurant but it was definitely worth it!! Portions are appropriate and dishes are presented like fine dining establishments. Owner and cook Tony, is Vietnamese-Chinese, and has worked in hotels and under masters to perfect his menu. Everything is made to order on the spot and authentic. The Lemongrass Chicken was juicy and tender and the grilled vegetables were sauteed to perfection. The beef vermicelli was sizable, impressing my Vietnamese-Chinese mother. The Creme Brulee was delicious; egg custard was a nice consistency as was the caramelized crust.  I did not get a chance to try the Pho, which I will return to do so in the future.   Service: Timely and efficient. My water glass was always filled. No complaints, though I would like to see more outgoing wait staff.  Overall: A lovely new hidden gem in Vaughn. Picko Lime is off to a great start. As long as they maintain the standards and quality they have set for themselves, I predict that this location will be a go-to spot for nearby shoppers looking for a modern, chic, authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Picko Lime is purposely and cheekily named for the jarred pickled limes that the owner's father used to can (he has since passed)."}
{"text":"I've tried pho at every pho restaurant available at this plaza and nothing beats picko lime's!! Rich tasty beef pho that's light and delicious. The catfish in tamarind soup is so savoury! Since I work in the area, I'd always make sure to stop by during break to order their food. The atmosphere and decor is very classy and washrooms very clean. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Wow!! The food here is so good, that I feel compelled to write a review while I am still eating!  High quality of meats used, fresh bean sprouts and mint leaves and flavourful broth. Best of all, portions are large. Also, when you order the larger bowl size, you don't just get more noodles with only a little more meat - you actually get a proportional increase in meat as well and they don't cheap out at all.  Decor is modern, well kept, clean and even the chopsticks are individually wrapped to prevent germs from going on them.  I've gone to a lot of Pho places and this one is now on the top of my list.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a spring roll and 2 large bowls of noodles. The spring rolls ($5 for 2 rolls cut in halves) are crispy and authentic. The broth for the pho ($12 each) is flavourful. I would prefer the beef to be more raw. Portion size is reasonable. However, it is a bit more expensive than other pho places."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho! Good service. Low key, nice looking place. I would recommend to friends. Lots of parking available too."}
{"text":"Have to say i've had better lemongrass chicken. I found it quite salty. I think I'm used to lemongrass chicken with a bit of sweetness. The chicken was tender tho, which was good, and I liked that the dish came with a side of veggies and not just rice. Don't know if I would go back though."}
{"text":"The only Vietnamese place we frequent in Vaughan. Their bun and pho are phenomenal and service is very good. High quality food and eating here is always a pleasure. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy!!  Small little restaurant - clean and cozy atmosphere.  Service was also friendly and fast!    We ordered the deep friend spring rolls as a starter, and shared the shrimp pho and seafood vermicelli as mains!  The spring rolls were delicious - very meaty and no fillers!  The vermicelli was also amazing - generous seafood toppings and the deep fried squid and fish were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!  Shrimp pho was just OK tho - nothing the write home about.   Was quite disappointed they didn't have a lot of drinks to choose from!  Would be great if they had more selection - like shakes and stuff.  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Very good pho! Tasty broth, fresh ingredients. This place is one of 2 I go to in Vaughan. Yum"}
{"text":"Tried Picko Lime today because our usual pho place next door was closed.    I am impressed.  The decor is very nice, sleek and modern ... washrooms very  clean.    Now to the food.  I had the bun (vermicelli) and asked for vegetarian version.  Though the noodles were warm, it was still very tasty and full of garlicky vegetables, tofu and spring rolls.  Also bonus points for having a vegetarian dipping sauce, instead of the usual nuoc cham made with fish sauce.  Mr Leny had the pho ga and declared it better than the competition next door which has been our go-to pho place.  Can't wait to go back to try Picko Lime's vegetarian pho to compare.    Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The chef also came out during our meal to ask how everything was.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Since being such pho addicts we decided to try this place out since we been trying out different pho restaurants around this area. This place is located right outside in one of those Plaza beside vaughan mills. Ambience is nice as they have several booths. My bf ordered the bun bo and he said it was diluted and tasted more like tum yum soup. I had the regular pho special and it was alright. The lady said the medium size one is quite big so I went for it. When it came, it was more of a small size. The soup is fairly good however the price is not the cheapest in terms of pho in the area. We probably won't be going back here for pho anytime soon considering there is pho vaughan and viet thai in the area that offer better quality and better price."}
{"text":"OK, so I did not like that place. Staff was OK but food was bad.  I asked for regular pho soup with beef and asked specifically not to put beef with tendons and excessive fat because I dislike it.  I got a soup with meat that was pretty much fat, tendons and other stuff which I dislike. I had a bad stomachache after their soup.  Also, we asked for spring rolls which were OK actually. However, it came with pickled carrots and daikon which tasted awful and were not crunchy at all.  Anyways, I am not going there again."}
{"text":"This place is really good for the pho stores around the area...  I always get the spring rolls n pho both are great  I will always come back"}
{"text":"Amazing food at reasonable prices. We come here with the family. The staff is polite. Service can be slow at times but it's never terrible. Highly recommended as good healthy option."}
{"text":"Tasty, reasonably priced Vietnamese fare served piping hot. What's not to like?! Spicy basil beef was delicious and the fried ice cream was a perfect end to a very satisfying meal. PS...the black sesame and ginger ice cream are excellent desert choices as well!"}
{"text":"I did take out - Vegetarian Fresh Rolls (delicious), Pho Nam (beef brisket), and Vietnamese chicken curry (delicious).  I was reminded that pho is something you don't take out. It's a bit of a pain putting all the ingredients together at home (Shame on me). I didn't find the pho to be flavourful as well.  I would return back if I did get that strong craving for Vietnamese food again. There are several dishes I would like to try."}
{"text":"Great dine-in experience.  One of the few pho restaurants that doesn't have the utensils out on display in those containers that are usually filthy! Here you get utensils brought to you which i really appreciate.  But the most important thing was the food - I had the pho a couple times now and it is always delicious, and the service is great too!  Although it's small, the decor is also nice and more updated and maintained unlike some others. I definitely would recommend however evenings can get busy!  Could only give this a 4 star because i tried take out once and i found the experience not as pleasant.  The food was still tasting great but the take out container is not good.  It makes a mess trying to pour the pho broth liquid into the noodles and meat container.  This only works if you have a large bowl of your own to pour everything into so be prepared in advance with one if you're going with take out pho."}
{"text":"I'm really quite surprised that this restaurant has a 4 star rating. We came on a Sunday around 1:30pm, so it wasn't busy. When we arrived, there were multiple tables open but they hadn't been cleaned off yet. As we waited for the waiter to wipe the table, he actually just moved the leftover food bits from the table ONTO THE FLOOR with his towel. I find this very unhygienic and a bit of a turn off. We ordered lemongrass pork with vermicelli and another with Rice, + a combo. The service was very slow - we must have waited at least half an hour to receive our food. Unfortunately, both our dishes lacked flavour. I even overdosed my vermicelli with fish sauce, but even the fish sauce was bland. We were rather disappointed by our experience here and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  Fried spring rolls: burnt Fresh rolls: packed w/lettuce&noodles (barely any meat) Hue style: good toppings, broth not flavourful Hoi an chicken: not good.. rice is brown rice  Pho: not bad. Not memorable  Service: not bad Decor/ambiance: great! Clean modern renos"}
{"text":"My first time here and the service was great.  Food was delicious.  Ordered the seafood vermicelli and the seafood was fresh and delicious.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Why do all the restaurants in the strip mall across from Vaughan Mills Mall suck....at least the ones we've been to. We needed a quick dinner before shopping so we decided to come here. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was not busy at all. There was only two other customers..hmm...but the reviews said the food was really good so we thought why not try it. We ordered Lemongrass Pork Chop with rice and Lemongrass Beef with rice. Both dishes were super oily. Felt like I had a grease attack and couldn't even finish it because that's how bad it was. Another thing is that they focused more on the \"presentation\" and served the food on fancy oversized plates making it look like you are getting a lot but really it's half the portion. Was really disappointed with this one too..."}
{"text":"Rarely do Viet places leave much of a positive impression on me. Growing up Viet definitely skewered my definition of \"impressive\", I admit, I tend to hold Viet food to a different standard. So frequently, I am disappointed with what I am served, if not disappointed then I am indifferent. I cannot remember the last Viet restaurant that actually left a good impression; truly distressing now that ponder about it.   I walked into this restaurant hungry but not expecting much. The setup is typical through décor is less in your face. I glanced through the menu and was underwhelmed and thought most items were pretty typical. The price was steeper than most places but I felt fancy and adventurous. We were seated, the wait staff was friendly and quite responsive, always a good start (then again, anything is a step up from the savoir-faire, point and do-it-yourself attitude I am used to being greeted with). I knew what I wanted straight off the bat.   I wanted the least typical thing possible. I wanted to order something new-ish. I chose the Ch Cá Lã Vng (the Hanoi Style Pan seared Catfish), the BF took the Gà Hi An (chicken). The dishes came and wow were we impressed. The high price tag seemed justifiable by the sheer portion and quality of what we received. The fish came in the make-it-yourself style and nicely presented where you can customize it to your liking. The fish fillet were serve over a flame in an iron cast pan to keep warm-at first I primarily thought it was for aesthetics but the meal progressed the presentation certainly had a functional purpose; the iron cast caramelized the onions and dill further to release all the flavour and sweetness locked in. I drizzled a bit of the fish sauce into the pan to add a bit extra flavour. The fillets with well cooked and marinated, the outside sealed in the juiciness of the meat and kept it tender. The herbs and noodle was a nice staple. To keep it authentic, you would have to use the mixed shrimp paste. The shrimp paste sauce as well as the dipping fish sauce are heavily based on preference of each person (it's truly hard to please everyone). For me, they did a decent job, especially good call on leaving the lime slice and chili pepper for adjustment. I, myself, would've liked a bit more acidity and sweetness but that's strictly me. I LOVED THE DISH!   The chicken was good but didn't impress me quite as much as the fish. The Chicken was well prepared and flavoured. The rice served alongside was definitely infused with chicken flavour. Nothing was wrong, but it was definitely overshadowed by the fish.   I will definitely come back to try their other offerings. They are worth the splurge for the level of service and quality. I am definitely a fan and am interested to see how they will continue to impress."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie pho!! The broth is super fresh and not oily.  Love the attention to detail with the veggies.  When I asked for no mushrooms they even added more of the other veggies, super delicious. I've come back multiple times just for that broth.  Service could be a little bit better re: attentiveness ..but it won't stop me from going back again and again"}
{"text":"First time being here. The usual Vietnamese restaurant to the left of this one actually closed down so thought to give this place a try. Overall, not bad. The food took some time to arrive to us but it was OK. We were served our drinks immediately. The food took awhile to come up despite we were the only customers eating there. The portions were OK but I'm use to eating at the Markham vietnamese restaurants that when I got my lemon grass pork chops on rice, the portion of the pork was super tiny. But they give you a huge bowl of rice and veggies. They also forgot to add my pickled carrots and daikon/radish on my dish even though the menu said it comes with it. I didn't bother to complain since I was super hungry and flagging someone down might rake awhile. My friend had a noodle soup and my other half ordered the Vietnamese chicken curry. Overall experience was OK.  Nothing wow but food was still decent.  I would give this place another try if I'm in the area. But I think Markham still has awesome Vietnamese restaurants with larger portions that don't leave you hungry. I give this rating a 4 stars because the food flavors were still tasty and authentic, service was just meeeh, wait time to sit was automatic and prices were mediocre for this style restaurant."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather on Saturday and knew that some hot pho would do the trick. Little did I know we had such a wonderful pho place right in the heart of Vaughan! Picko Lime was a bit hard to find at first but it's right next to Chatime Vaughan which I frequent, as most of you know  once my friends and I came inside I was impressed by the surprisingly chic interior, with clean new custom menus, branded chop sticks, and the servers had iPads which they took our order and could also show us a visual preview of what we were ordering if we were unsure. Very clever!   As most pho places go, prices were extremely reasonable and servings were huge. Not to mention everything tasted great.  The service was also great, and the music was modern and enjoyable.   Should be noted that the reason we chose this place over the place literally next door was that picko Lime was open until 11, half an hour later than everywhere else. That extra half an hour was what sold it, as we wanted a late snack and didn't want to feel too rushed. We finished right at 11. Had a great time. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood vermicelli ($15) from here and loved it! Lots of seafood toppings including catfish, shrimp and fish patties. Very generous portions!! Super impressed with the catfish it was probably the best catfish I had, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.   This place not only serves your typical Vietnamese food, they also serve lots of dishes that you would not normally find at a regular pho joint. I would come back and try other things on the menu. Only thing is I wish they supply bottles of sweet sauce and sriracha on the side like most Vietnamese restaurants. I'm sure they would if you ask but then you gotta ask."}
{"text":"Was going to give this place a one star for the food but added another star because staff was friendly. Me and my bf order pho, nem nuong and bowl of bun thit nuong. The food portion was small, taste was mediocre and the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Vaughan. It's a western style restaurant with Vietnamese foods. Nice decoration and the foods are really delicious. My husband and I have come here many times and we tried almost every dish in the menu. This is the first Vietnamese restaurant where the waitress takes the order without having us write it down. Nice waiters. The chef often comes out from the kitchen and walks around the store and chat with you. We really love the Siracha chicken wings and the Bun cha muc, Bun cha ca. They are just open so not many people know about this place. We hope they will be successful, and for sure, we will come back again."}
{"text":"Great experiences up until today. Found hair in my food and told it would be compensated and they kept it on the bill (but did not communicate this until we asked). Bad attitude from the staff who didn't even try to explain anything.  Definitely won't be back and no, I've never nor would I ever put my own hair in my food to save $9.00. It's about doing the right thing the right way with your customers. We've recommended a few of our friends here and will be sharing our experience of how your staff handled this today. Really disappointed.  That said, really nice chef who's very proud of his food. Poor staff managing with bad attitude and poor communication, you should be ashamed. All over a bowl of pho not even half finished!"}
{"text":"Went to this place after pho mi Asia 99 at the other plaza closed down. It's funny how at this plaza all these pho restaurants are like right beside each other. I chose this one because of its transparency to inside, being that it look cleaned and some guests were eating as well. It didn't fail to disappoint. The pho was good, but my bf complained about the small portions at prices that are fairly expensive than the average pho restaurants. I love the other options that they gave on the menu and I am definitely coming back here to try them. This time we ordered common things like boun and pho. Spring rolls are also very good and staff are friendly. Ironically, the lemon grass chicken boun came than the house special pho. Usually pho places should be faster and should be a quick eat - this one wasn't this time."}
{"text":"A great bowl of Pho!  This particular Vietnamese restaurant has all the same menu items, but I found the richness of the Pho broth much more flavourful than many other places.  A great lunch and at a good price, I'll make Picko Lime a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The place was great, such lovely presentation of food. One of the best Vietnamese restaurant filled with traditional authentic Viet food. On top of that, decor and the restaurant itself was beautiful (in comparison to other Viet places). 5/5 would definitely go again. I gave this a 4/5 because of food being on the pricier side; however, not by much in comparison to other Viet places. Anyways, you pay for what you get, and this place is just perfect."}
{"text":"This is a quality Vietnamese eatery. That's a word you don't usually associate with Viet cuisine; at least not often in the examples we have in this city.  Let's start with the good. The broth is flavourful, complex and clean. You do taste the various herbs and spices used and it's not overly greasy or salty. I have to commend them on the meats in my Pho. They are probably some of the best I have ever had in any Pho. You can tell these guys took the time to hand cut their beef (they use sirloin) from the slight variations in the thickness to the \"with the grain\" cut not seen with machine cut meat. There's a noticeable pronounced beefy taste to their meats. Even the chicken pho had an excellent broth. Though the chicken can be better. The prices are a tad above average but in the grand scheme of things you do get a slightly larger bowl of noodles than most places and most importantly you get top notch quality.  There are only a few things that detract them from getting the full 5 stars. The bbq chicken in the chicken pho lacked flavour. You do pickup hints of lemongrass, sugar, lime and fish sauce...just not enough of it. There's also a lack of char to the meat. Secondly, the highly touted sriracha wings were a big letdown. The wings are dreadfully overcooked to the point of almost become chicken jerky. The sauce on the this was delicious but did lack some acidity. I supposed I could squeeze some lime on it myself but I shouldn't have to. This part is an easy fix."}
{"text":"Amazing, people. JUST GO! The decor, the service, the food, even the cutlery is lovely. The presentation of the food was beautifully done (you don't see much of that at pho restaurants). While we were eating our meals, the chef came out and asked us how our food was. This shows how confident the chef is in his cooking, which also makes the customer feel way better about what they are eating. Overall it was an excellent dining experience and will definitely be back. Oh yeah, the prices are great too! :-)"}
{"text":"What lured me into this place..was the fact that their menu offered northern vietnamese dishes that I have not seen anywhere else in the city. Restaurant is nestled in a busy plaza, ample of parking. Decor and ambiance is definitely nicer than most viet restaurants and is geared towards the caucasian demographic. Pho broth is ok - I've had better. I had that cha ca la vong (tumeric spiced fish w/ dill and onions) - which is supposed to be their signature dish. I had this dish in Hanoi, Vietnam and have been dreaming of when I'll get a chance to eat it again. Anyways, Picko made a good attempt but not quite the same. They have some other signature dishes I also wanted to try, like bun cha ca. I'm not sure if I'll ever eat there again...maybe if I happen to be in the area, but I wouldnt go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Went here for their Bun Cha Ca which is number 22 with my mom. The food was fresh, good, cleaning and reasonable prices with good portions. Would come here again to try other dishes. Very friendly and attentive staff. Recommended my friends to come try this place too. Very close to Vaughan Mills & easy to park :)"}
{"text":"Went here again tonight and I must say it's by far the best pho restaurant in Vaughan.  The decor and service are very good.  The food is also excellent."}
{"text":"Our favourite Vietnamese restaurant by Vaughan Mills! The restaurant cannot fit a lot of people so we always pick an off time to go cuz it is so good! Totally family friendly and staff is so welcoming and nice.  I always upgrade my pho to make it a combo cuz spring rolls and meat sausage are sooo worth that extra $2.50!! Their crab and dill pho.  It is the best I have yet! Would recommend people to go!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bun bo hue.  The broth was clear and had no msg.  It wasn't spicy.  Bun bo hue was supposed to be spicy.  I would order a regular pho next time."}
{"text":"Delicious! Summer roll with shrimp and pork is perfectly proportioned and not overstuffed with rice noodles. Tastes light and fresh. House Special Pho noodle soup was great- broth was flavorful and yummy, good sized bowl for $10. Very pleased I stumbled on this place! Restaurant itself is very clean, waitstaff is friendly and efficient..."}
{"text":"Great place with even better service! Waiter was able to answer all my questions and made great suggestions.  Ordered the beef soup, but the waiter brought over a small sample of the chicken for me to try for next time and it was also great!  Definitely heading back there soon."}
{"text":"There's a rule of thumb that I have: never trust a Vietnamese restaurant with good decor.  I've been proven wrong on very few, select occasions, but Picko Lime is not one of the m unfortunately. Prices are a touch higher than the neighbouring competition, and perhaps for good reason -- they do need to cover the cost of their snazzy reno and fancy washrooms. They also put in a bit more effort into presenting their dishes.  But at the end of the day, the food is largely unsatisfying. Having grown up frequenting pho restaurants, I'd say I have a fairly established standard to compare these guys against and they have fallen quite short. Pho broth was bland and unflavourful. This wasn't just an attempt to have a \"lighter\" flavour or more \"natural\" broth without the excess MSG often used by pho establishments, it was an outright travesty. Maybe their other dishes are decent, but I don't know if you can really call yourself a Vietnamese restaurant without at least a half-decent pho. It's fine to have other types of dishes as your specialty, but the pho was bad enough that quite frankly I don't care to give these guys another chance.  Much better options within a 10 minute drive in any direction."}
{"text":"What a great place. They have amazing food and awesome staff. It's not just Vietnamese but they have a great variety of Thai food also.  It's relatively a small place in a very busy plaza but let me assure, you won't be disappointed.  Try their Mango Salad.  Will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Pho and quite literally stumbled onto Picko Lime.  It is a great place with an excellent menu.  We had the Summer Rolls for appy and were so fresh; the Bun Bo Hue -  Lemongrass Beef Noodle Soup with sliced pork and beef shank,  a really tasty soup; and Bun Cha Ha Noi - Bun Cha Hanoi Style Grilled Pork belly and meatballs. It was really good.  Fresh.  Awesome. Highly recommended. The Chef came out to chat with us afterwards which was a nice touch.  If you are in Vaughan you must try Picko Lime."}
{"text":"Ordered: 5 Bbq meat, $7. Siracha chicken wings (5), $7. Large House Pho, $12. Spring rolls, $5. Avocado smoothie, $4.50  I don't think that it is an authentic Pho restaurant. Pho was bland and lacked substance: Has 1 tendon and 4 strips of meat. 2 beef balls. The 5 Bbq patties were ho-hum. The spring rolls were crispy but tasted bland.  The avocado shake was ok.  The place was clean. The service was alright."}
{"text":"Very impressive of their service The food good Excepted the raw beef noodle soup is salty The price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Vietnamese traditional dishes from the north, I must say they got the presentation but the taste is not there. But I can see the authenticity of it. Felt the dishes were a bit flavourless. Feel that picko lime needs a bit of work on the taste. We had cha ca va long, bun thit nuong, bun ga rieu and pho. Cha ca ca long wasn't bad. But my next visit I may give it a try later in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried fillet tamarind noodle soup. I requested spicy and it was delicious! The broth was tasty, not spicy enough for my liking but its got a nice kick.  Definitely order the spring roll! It came out fresh and hot. Crispy with nice filling."}
{"text":"Walked in only to be greeted by a waitress with very nice manners. The aesthetics and interior of Picko Lime was very modern and clean, something I enjoyed.  Upon ordering the food however, which was summer rolls, a plate of Chicken Curry and Lemongrass Porkchop with rice, I was very disappointed.  The lemongrass with rice was smaller in portion compared to other Pho restaurants in the area with lower prices, coming with only one piece of steak with some vegetables on the side.  The Chicken Curry on the otherhand was not authentic asian curry at all, it was thick and looked plus tasted much like (if not) Glico's Japanese Curry sauce which I could have easily bought from the market and ate at home.  Summer rolls on the otherhand were the highlight of my food, fresh and pretty well portioned.  There are better Pho restaurants around the area that cater better portioned rice as well as better tasting curry. I cannot speak on the other dishes, but if you're looking for a clean atmosphere with great service then this is the place to go, otherwise you can do better."}
{"text":"Came in today for a late lunch. I ordered the vegetarian fresh rolls to start. The ingredients were fresh and the peanut dip was delicious. As an entree I ordered the vegetarian pho. It was a good size with generous veggies and tofu. The broth was filled with flavour and was very good.   The reason for the 4 stars is that the server was nice, but not attentive. Didn't check up after receiving  both meals. I will be back though, food was really good."}
{"text":"Casual, but modern and clean, with comfy booths. Friendly service. Food was great and came out suuuuperr hot!. I had the catfish and tamarind soup. Great broth and the fish was nicely seared and meaty. Wasn't sure if I'd like the 'patties', but the fish and the pork ones were nicely seasoned -not rubbery or full of fillers. Hubby had the pork belly and vermicelli. He liked that they didn't skimp on the meat. Would go back and skip the Vaughan Mills food court to have a real meal here."}
{"text":"Food tasted a little on the bland side to me. I don't think I'd come back. I had the bun bo hue. Wasn't enough flavour and didn't have enough extra toppings. Just seemed like a bowl of noodles and broth"}
{"text":"I have found the best Bun Cha Ga in town!!!  Those of you that have been following my reviews probably know that I have an obsession with bun cha ga and have been on a quest for the best bun cha ga for a while. This is it, the best so far.   The broth was just right, not too sour, not too salty with a good amount of dill and roots to enhance the broth flavour. The quality and quantity of meats were top notch. I got 4 big chunks of grill catfish and 2  fish cakes. The Mr. Ordered bun rieu which was also very good.   The service was good. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious - this was my first time having pho so I don't have any other pho dishes to compare it to but the first try was great! I highly recommend the spring roles and the pork chops to start. I got the house pho and my friend got the vermicelli chicken, and the vermicelli was the best of the two mains."}
{"text":"Contemporary decor  Ambiance atmosphere  Friendly staff  Prompt service  Great Vietnamese authentic food selection"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and didn't have to wait. Its conveniently located across from Vaughan mills but there's lots of Vietnamese cuisine here. My family chose to go to picko lime and it didn't disappoint.  The food was great! I got the lemongrass pork vermicelli and I also tried the classic rice noodle soup, the pho tai Nam (sirloin/brisket). The vermicelli portion seemed slightly smaller than other places but it was still filling and yummy.   Would definitely come back again to try other items when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is good but over the last few years, service has been poor recently. It was my family's go to place for Viet food but not anymore. Plenty of other options around the area to try."}
{"text":"I can't give this restaurant anything higher. The rating sits at 1.5/5 stars. I drove all the way from the east side during rush hour to catch a quick dinner with my family and left hungry, and disappointed   Hospitality was 3.5/5 - she was pretty slow on our drinks/ just getting water or tea that came out after our appetizer   I feel like the rating of this restaurant only goes for those who have never tasted authentic Viet food.   The bun cha hanoi tasted horrible. The only good part was the vermicelli. There were many things wrong about that dish. I'm the master of eating the dish. The type of pork they used was just the ordinary \"bun thit nuong\" meat. The patties which i was very much excited for lacked in flavor, and tasted like nothing like the pork. The sauce for the bun cha was sadly not made properly either and lacked in flavor   The bun cha ca (fish patty with soup) lacked in flavor, and they used the wrong type of vermicelli for it. The patty itself was OK.. nothing good i can say about it   My bf tried some Hoi an chicken broth rice or something like that and it was not worth it for the price. Came with less than a bowl full of rice on a plate, with regular chicken that too tasted like nothing.   The spring rolls were decent. Too much carrots tho.   The place was clean, but i would never recommend this place to anyone. I've been back home many times, and my family cooks these dishes too. Everything i tasted here tasted like tap water.   I'm sorry but 4 stars for a crappy non authentic vietnamese restaurant is a no go. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for its food, or for viet food in general. Second of all, definitely not your typical viet get up. You can tell they tried to cater to the more western style in their restaurant.  Waited over 25 mins for a bowl of pho and bun. We presumed the food would taste good if it's taking this long to make... nope. Bun was bland. Oh and you only have a choice of one meat and they would charge an extra $2.50 to \"make it a combo\" for the usual spring roll and sausage  (nem nuong), which btw authentic viet places never do.  The pho that came was less salty than usual, which is good based on personal preference. But I preferably like it saltier than what the establishment sends out.  I'm going to stick with the old school establishment from now on.  Mississauga still has the best pho in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place with good services, I came around 8pm.  guess they are not busy so the chef came out talk to talk to us.  He was made sure we were happy with the meal and explain the history of the dish.   Must try the catfish noodles, it limited in the store for everyday."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean Service was good  BUT, large beef pho ($12)only had a very large bowl....  broth was tasteless,  beef didn't taste fresh at all and  just little bit of noodles.   This should only be size Medium in other Vietnamese restaurants I will not recommend this restaurant if you want pho.  There is another pho restaurant in the same plaza which tasted a lot better than here."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Picko Lime serves more than Pho and Bun which is more for casual eats. I like how the menu is versatile that includes other items that might not find in a regular Vietnamese joint.  Ch Cá Lã Vng - Hanoi Style Pan Seared Cat Fish?  Bún Ch Cá - Cat Fish in Tamarind Broth?  The meat they used in their Pho are Sirloin Beef which is of better cut that does reflect in higher pricing.  So for some that are willing to pay a little more for a better dining experience: environment, deco and plating. Picko Lime is the place to be compare to other Vietnamese restaurants in the same plaza.   Mc Chiên - Calamari ($7) Ch Giò - Spring Rolls ($4) Bún Ch Hà Ni - Hanoi Style Grilled Pork ($11) Bò Lúc Lc - Shaken Beef  ($14)  All the dish we shared were solid. Nothing too amazing but it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Soup portions were huge and delicious. Don't know what's the big deal about paying ten dollars for a bowl of soup so not sure why people are whining about it being expensive. I ordered the beef brith with veggies. Veggies were fresh and delicious. My boyfriend got the sirloin pho with beef broth and the meat came very lean. Will definitely come back  Update: I still love coming here. The chef always comes out to say hello, food is fairly priced and HIGH quality I can't stress that enough"}
{"text":"This is a small spot within a strip mall. The place is clean and service was ok. Got the grilled chicken vermicelli. The chicken tasted great and the noodles are the thin kind of vermicelli, which I enjoyed. The dish came with pickled carrots and cucumbers which was delicious. The presentation was good but nothing special. Overall good experience but wasn't blown away by the food."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I was in the mood for some pho and they had the pickled limes on display and that is something that I really love drinking/snacking on. The inside has a very modern decor and I found service to be very friendly and fast.  I had the large pho special ($9), spring rolls ($4) and the pickled limenade ($3.5). I would say that this place is fairly priced considering that they are located in Vaughan and I've been to some places here where I paid $20 for pho and a smoothie.  The pho was fairly standard, as nothing really stood out but at the very least, the broth had a decent amount of flavour and decent amount of meat. The noodles were to my liking as well.  The Springs rolls were very crispy and tasty as well. I must say though that no matter where I try Vietnamese spring rolls, I will always compare it to my mother's which cannot be topped.  Lastly, the pickled limenade a nice refreshing beverage. It tasted like that had used 7-up or sprite rather than club soda. I've never ahd pickled limenade outside of either my home or my aunt's so I'm unsure of how it should be but the slices of limes (3 slices) I had in my drink weren't really edible. This is suppose to be my favorite part of the drink and I was pretty let down about it. I could be wrong and maybe its either meant to be as firm and tasteless or maybe others don't eat it at all but I wouldn't know.  I'd say this place is worth a try. Next time I'll have to try the Cm as the pictures I saw looked very tasty. Make sure you give the limenade a try as it seems they named themslves after it!"}
{"text":"Picko Lime is a fairly small Vietnamese restaurant in the strip malls between Rutherford and Vaughan Mills Mall. The restaurant has about 5 or 6 tables and some decent decor. The booth seats where we were sitting were a little thin and any movement pushes the back cushions for the patrons on the other side of the booth, which was unpleasant.  We ordered the regular brisket pho and seafood vermicelli noodle bowl. The regular size pho was quite large. Most of it was noodles, though, and the beef had a lot of fat. The broth was tasty. The seafood vermicelli noodle bowl was good as well. The shrimps were marinated and grilled, the egg rolls were crispy and also had shrimp in them.  For dessert, we ordered a creme brulee and a fried banana with black sesame ice cream. The creme brulee was good; your standard creme brulee. The fried banana was good as well, but the black sesame ice cream was amazing! It was nice and smooth."}
{"text":"Food was great, very good-sized Large pho. Beef was advertised as sirloin and much better than the typical cheap meat found in other places. Nice fresh bean sprouts which weren't cold because they just came out of a freezer.  You can tell a lot about a place by its details. The chopsticks are wrapped for hygiene which is appreciated. The washroom has automatic soap and paper towel dispensers which is cool. Not very large washrooms though and not wheelchair accessible, which is very understandable given space constraints.  Has free wifi!!!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurant tucked away from the main attractions of Vaughan Mills Mall.  At first it seemed like a less dingy restaurant but the restaruant was lacking some service. There was one table that was left as a mess for a while even though we have sat down and ordered already. But getting the order in wasn't  as straight forward. We sat down and they asked us what we like to drink which was pretty quick to ask but we waited and waited and waited and eventually we got the menu to start ordering. The table that  came after us already ordered before we got our menu.   In terms of food we ordered the House Special Pho (large) and Bun Cha Ca (grilled catfish and fish cake noodle). The house special pho was meh... it seems like a very big bowl of soup and some noodles and beef. The soup base was very typical nothing very special about it. The Bun Cha Ca was something different in a much better way. The flavour was unqiue and flavourful. The pickle added a little something special to it. The catfish, well catfish is normally good. I would recommend the Bun Cha Ca noodle."}
