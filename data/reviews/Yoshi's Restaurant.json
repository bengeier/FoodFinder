{"text":"That's right, five stars. But that's based on my first visit, so take it with a grain of salt. 

Right across the street from a light rail stop, nice happy hour, free wifi (!!), and teriyaki chicken that's really good. Seriously, I've paid tons more for worse teriyaki at loud sushi bars. The chicken had a great charbroiled flavor, it wasn't rubbery and fake, the veggies were crisp and fresh, and the sauce was flavorful -- so much better than the wad of gloppy corn syrup nastiness I've come to expect from mall food courts.

I would definitely have taken off a star or two if I'd gotten some of the terrible service I read about in other reviews, but for me it was fine. There was only one lady working the register and the drive through, so I can see how it wouldn't take much of a crowd to overload her, but I got lucky."}
{"text":"As a college student on a budget, Yoshi's is the bees knees! I can get a regular side of white rice and an egg roll for $3.25. I'm really not sure it can get any better than that! I could pay the same at McDonald's but then I wouldn't get the lovely small talk with the employees that work there! 

I love Yoshi's and it's never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Yoshi's for nearly 20 years. Over that time the service has declined tremendously. The last time we were in was about a year ago. They were supposed to bring us out our food but we waited for over 30 MINUTES and no one ever showed up and I couldn't even find the person, so we just left. 
So today my girl suggests Yoshi's.. we go to the location on Central. I start to order my food and the line cook lady says, \"I'm not making those.\" (referring to a veggie sushi roll item). I said I would wait if necessary but.. same thing. Nothing. And the cashier just stood there trying not to laugh!!! 
Was so pissed I drove to the 24th st location in an attempt to speak with the owner who is usually there during the days but no dice.. was told that he was gone. So I left my phone number for the owner to contact me but nothing yet. 
I will update this when/if he ever does. 
Until then, I am never setting foot in Yoshi's again. Good luck running a business with employees like that.. you'll need it."}
{"text":"Dear Yoshi's.  You and I go way way back.  Remember that one time I ordered Combo #2 (Teriyaki chicken)?  Oh yeah I mean that was about 500 times.  Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok, eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now, Yoshi's, but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok, we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot, fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price."}
{"text":"I went to To Yoshi's on my lunch hour.  I ordered a chicken teriyaki rice bowl. When I got to my office to eat, I noticed there was no napkins or fork in my bag. So how am I suppose to eat a rice bowl with no plastic ware? The chicken was dry and burnt around the edges. Quality has gone down which makes it over priced."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this fast food restaurant with Asian flavor.  It is a positive surprise.  Of course I am using the standard of fast food restaurant instead of full service restaurant.  I think for any one tired of burger and fries, this would be a good alternative choice.  The staff are friendly and efficient, the restaurant is clean, the service is quick and the dishes are quite decent although Americanized -- probably better than the real authentic version.  Detailed comments on the dished we ordered.  1.  Teriyaki rice bowl, quite good, better than the one from Jack in a Box, although a little less sauce would be even better.  2.  Musaka curry -- my boys said they are very good chicken meat/steaks.  3.  Udon Noddle, decent and not salty at all (we like it).  4. Miso soup -- a complete different soup from the original miso soup we expected, but not bad (I think it should not be called miso soup here).  If you have open mind fir some nice, healthy fast food with very affordable price, please go.  If you expect an authentic full course Japanese meal, this is not the place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent and the service fast, but the last 4 times I've been in on my lunch hour, the air conditioning has been out, so I've been avoiding going there lately. :("}
{"text":"I have gone there many times for a quick rice bowl.  But no more service has progressively gotten worse.  I contacted the owner to complain about my experience but no reply.  The inside is fairly clean but worn out.  The chairs and booths are worn out and very uncomfortable.  Too bad it use to be a nice place to go, I don't know if it is run by someone different or the owner just stopped caring about it."}
{"text":"I've been here on three occasions.  I ordered the same thing every time.  On The first visit it was fresh grilled chicken on my teriyaki veggie chicken bowl, the second time the same order far less fresh, tonight, my last trip here, warmed over dark meat chicken on over cooked rice, mushy veggies swimming in sauce.  Gross.  I just moved here from Denver and I'm trying to find something similar to Tokyo joes, this isn't it.  Don't go, there is nothing fresh or delicious about this."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken (white meat only) and the spicy Dragon chicken are excellent, I would recommend trying one of these two for first timers. Orange chicken is usually above average, all other deep fried entrees are okay. Egg rolls & spring rolls are both very good. Spicy chili side sauce is awesome here."}
{"text":"I'd say to avoid this place until they learn proper food safety.

I used to go once a week until I saw the staff handling trash then just grab a little Purell and go back to handing out food. Then I saw a cook come out of the restroom, grab some Purell and go back into the kitchen and put his apron on."}
{"text":"Horrible! The rice tasted it was steamed with dirty water and the quality of the meat was very poor! I heard good things about it so I tried it! Will never be going there again!"}
{"text":"Try their dragon chicken bowl! It's great!
The service is good, you don't wait much, you get served less than 2 minutes.. 
Parking is easily accessible.. The staff are happy and the place is clean"}
{"text":"Affordable and quick! Pretty good for what you're paying for. Employees are always kind and the place is clean. Never had a bad experience. If you're looking for fine dining gourmet, try going to PF Changs instead of leaving this nice little place a bad Yelp review."}
{"text":"What can I say, I really like the Hibachi beef.  Whenever someone is willing to make a run, it's hard to pass up.  It's spicy, flavorful with a good meat to noodle ratio.  And for $7, you get your money's worth.  Not a fancy place by any means, but the food is on point.  If they would put a location closer to PC, I would be there more often."}
{"text":"So being from Seattle, I'm kind of a Teriyaki afficionado (sp?) I have lived in the valley for 5 year now, after moving back from Italy. I've always lived near Central, and no further North of Camelback or South of Osborn. What a great find in Yoshi's, let me tell you. I have been completely hooked on the teriyaki chicken and rice bowl. The chicken is grilled (like it's supposed to be), the rice is well done and the sauce is just right. Those are the three things that really make a good teriyaki.  BONUS: They even have a drive through! Now I will say that I've never had anything else on the menu, but this is the best teriyaki I've had in the valley hands down. And where else can you eat a great lunch that's not fast food for 5 bucks????"}
{"text":"Well, I was driving between work locations and in need of a quick lunch when I saw Yoshi's through the windshield.  I thought I remember hearing this was owned by the same guy who did Yasu Sushi (which is sublime) so I went in despite the large Pepsi banner outside.  I should have known just by that a lackluster experience was about to be had...
I ordered the spicy dragon beef bowl and gyoza and an iced tea :)  The beef had an interesting flavor akin to melted plastic.  I kept waiting for the spicy to kick in but it never did.  The gyoza were cold, yet amazingly enough they were crunchy enough to chip teeth if you weren't careful.
The tea wasn't bad..."}
{"text":"I wasn't to impressed by the building but the location was convenient and the other location was not at the moment. I was the only customer in this big place! I had the chicken Yakasoba. It was all thigh meat. It was okay. There was a healthy percentage of fresh vegetables in the dish to make it a balanced meal. The cost was comparable to having a burger meal but a nice change. It's still not the noodle oasis I was seeking. I have had better Yakasoba but I'll return at least once to try the Teriyaki at some point and the other location."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine ever since I was a youngster. I have always known that when I'm in the mood for some cheap Chinese food that tastes magnificent, this is my spot. If you're expecting a world-class dining experience, you should probably look elsewhere... but if you're looking for a world class take-out experience, you've hit the jackpot!! *cha-ching*"}
{"text":"The price is reasonable.  They give you a good portion of  chichen and rice however  the chicken  was a little  dry and there is too much sauce  on the rice. Their teriyaki  sauce is a little  sweet . It is a good value"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch there for the first time.  Was going to Subway on 24th Street and Indian School and saw the Yoshi's sign, thought I'd check it out first.  Well, if you are familiar with Samari Sam's its basically the same concept.  Many of the same menu items and bowls as SSam's.  I'd have to agree with some of the reviews on here about the taste of dirty or tap water with the veggies/rice.  I'm sure it's not a health code violation although I just ate, we'll see in a few mins (crossing fingers).  

I'd say if you are craving this type of menu it's not that bad, pretty decent taste and the egg roll was nice and fried and crispy just how I like it.  I do have to say the cashier could be a little more happy to take my order.  She wasn't rude or anything just kinda, bleh as far as her demeanor.  Oh well, she probably was just having a bad day, but that and the small funny taste was the only negatives I can say about this place.  I'll probably go back again when I'm craving this type of menu, it just won't be anytime soon.  Maybe in a few weeks or so.  Hope this review helps you."}
{"text":"Convenient for quick lunch and reasonably priced.  I ordered teriyaki salmon rice bowl.  Lunch rice bowl is more of rice than the topping.  It was fast to order and eat between meetings.  Their drive-through is also convenient."}
{"text":"I was really craving rice & veggies so I came here only to get a really crappy meal. There was almost no teriyaki sauce on my meal first of all. Secondly the rice was not well cooked. Thirdly the food had a funky under taste like if they had cooked the food in toilet water (NOT KIDDING). That is the best I can describe my experience, however I did give them an extra star for at least being very polite over the phone, and being courteous."}
{"text":"Ok, I say this all of the time to friends and coworkers, so I will just say it here.....u believe present staff has really turned this place around. The food is tastier, friendly staff is always good... I'm the beginning I only went Yoshi's because someone else dragged me there! Now the food is just good!"}
{"text":"ordered 2 chicken teriyaki bowls and one salad at drive through. Chicken tou7gh and dry!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki bowl with white meat is good.  It's not knock your socks off but I go there weekly to get my rice bowl fix on.

The lunch service is pretty fast which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is so harsh about this place.  You have to set appropriate expectations when visiting a place like this.  The restaurant was dated, but clean, the staff was super friendly and quite helpful and the food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  We sat outside with our furry friend and enjoyed ourselves for a quick bite to eat when we didn't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"It's fine. 

I miss the Yoshi's of old, though. They used to make the sushi rolls as you ordered them. The Yoshi Roll was the best!! They still make them, but they are never available (and they are called Chicken rolls now). I asked why and they only make 2 orders worth in the morning and they go fast.  That to me says MAKE MORE ROLLS."}
{"text":"If you are someone who appreciates REAL ingredients in your food than I do NOT recommend the Sesame Chicken. Best case scenario, the \"Chicken\" part of the meal is processed chicken made from scraps with heavy battering, or worst case, it isn't chicken at all. Difficult to say for sure. It certainly doesn't have a texture that resembles chicken to me (kind of a soft rubbery squish) and it is so heavily battered and spiced, it's impossible to tell.  I havn't had every item on the menu but  suspect that Yoshi's is attempting to increase their profitability by substituting less expensive ingredients in those meal selections that they feel they can fool us on.   I'm very disappointed. Their food used to be much better than this.  Bottom line?, . . . I would rather pay more for quality ingredients.

Where is Trump when you need him.
\"Make Yoshi's Great Again\""}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to truly love this place. I don't. What better could one ask for? Drive-thru teriyaki? Sign me up! Well. After my second visit, I think I'd rather unsubscribe. 

My first visit was later in the evening for dinner. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with a side of spring rolls. Service was lackluster but prompt at the drivethrough window. The teriyaki bowl was of rational size. The chicken was a little charred and crispy, which isn't super appetizing in a teriyaki bowl. The teriyaki sauce itself was SO sweet, I don't even want to imagine how it's made. Probably about three times sweeter than other fast-casual teriyaki joint's sauces. But, being hungry I wolfed it down. 

The second time I came here was also for dinner. I got one of their yakisoba bowls, which is advertised (I think) as a citrus yakisoba. Again, this dish was SO sweet. Even sweeter than the teriyaki. The sauce tasted similar to orange marmalade. This dish was not so great, and I decided it was easier to be hungry than to eat the rest. 

The only real pleasurable thing I've had here was their spring rolls. They were fairly good. Not amazing, but good. 

I really wanted to love this place, but it's hard to even try to when the food has been consistently below average."}
{"text":"Quality has really gone down. Last time there were bones in chicken. This visit the chicken was like rubber. I will not go again."}
{"text":"Seriously the best teriyaki in town! Plus the nicest team of people in town! Everytime I come thru the drive thru I more or less order the same thing. Sometimes they are out of my favorite cucumber avocado rolls. I just drove through to grab dinner on my way home and they were out of them again. They've very generously offered to make me a fresh roll and then surprise to me with an additional cucumber avocado roll for free for all the times that they have been out in the past. I have been to the location on Central and Indian School as well as the 24th street and Indian School location and has been met with equal friendliness at both locations. I love this place! The fact that their central location also has a drive thru makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"It's basically Asian fast food - and the quality of the food is pretty good for that standard. It's priced right as well. The food is ready, well, fast, since it is fast food. The inside, however, is the area that needs improvement. You can tell there's been some wear and tear to the building and the booths."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure what a spent $8 on. The food was cooked well, but it had a funky taste like the rice was cooked in dirty water. I'm not a fan simply because it was overpriced and the food was sub-par."}
{"text":"My dad picked up Yoshi's tonight, and it smelled really good! We ate the large spicy teriyaki which is only 5.99!!! It fed both me and my dad! Sooo cheap! I thought it was pretty good.I wish there was a bit less sauce (I like low sodium dishes), but next time we'll just ask for less sauce or sauce on the side! Problem fixed! :) I don't know why they are rated so low. I want them to stay in business so I can keep buying good food for little money! Haha."}
{"text":"Love the convenience, great prices and drive thru! I have kids, so getting out of the car to run in and get take out is a pain. So glad to have a place in the neighborhood that is quick and not a regular fast food place. Great udon, egg rolls, teriyaki chicken, and yakisoba."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot.   I always order the Dragon Chicken bowl.  It's made of onions, green bell peppers, sliced carrots, ginger, chicken all stir fried in spicy sauce.  It's very delicious!  Egg rolls are okay.  Pricing is affordable!  I definitely recommend Yoshi's for lunch."}
{"text":"This food is delicious. I love a good value, which translates directly to quality of food and most of all flavor. It doesn't matter if it's a fancy place or not. I've been coming to Yoshi's on Central and Indian School road for years. I get the teriyaki chicken on brown rice. The chicken is grilled over fire to perfection, and the brown rice is satisfying. The sauce is very good. A perfect mix of not too salty and sweet. I like that they let you put your own ginger on. Their Asian salad is wonderful too. And, every staff person is friendly and welcoming and it's very clean. And, no, I don't work for them, I just like to eat here. Thanks Yoshi's for a great lunch that I actually crave."}
{"text":"I just spent the last 24 hours vomiting in my bathroom due to food poisoning. I don't think they cook their chicken all the way."}
{"text":"Great food, prices, service and a well rounded menu couldn't ask for anything else. They're 3-5 lunch special is also pretty good for the price!"}
{"text":"I used to work a short walk from here and I ate here every day for three months straight. I couldn't get through the day without a bowl of the dynamite chicken. It was a craving like no other. Compared to most fast food options this place is a breath of fresh air. I wish I had one near me."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Dragon bowl, delish!!! Plenty of chicken , tasty vegetables. I would come again.  Next time Going to try the white teriyaki chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Food good.  Girl workers there polite and efficient, but too many freakish earrings everywhere.    Mostly ghetto teen customers there on a weekday afternoon last I went."}
{"text":"Solid rice bowls for quick, savory, reasonably priced meals.  Been a patron of Yoshi's for nearly ten years they are consistently clean, with considerate service, and flavorful rice bowls. Here and at their 24th St & Indian School location.  They have some tributes hanging up here to sports celebrities that are fans of Yoshi's so that is cool to see.  Confirmed that the Happy Hour special is at both locations.  Plenty of parking behind the building, easy in and easy out, makes Yoshi's great take out."}
{"text":"I know I don't look it but I'm actually of Japanese descent and I have eaten Japanese food everywhere from my Grandma's kitchen to Sashimi in Hong Kong to Japan itself and I try not to be an overly
critical food snob but frankly this is exactly the food a persons imagination would conjure of you said \"I got some Japanese food in Arizona\" it's average quality... Confused ingredients and the rice is over cooked as hell and funny tasting"}
{"text":"Panda Express orange chicken is better. 

What I got tasted like it was was already cooked and they threw it back in the fryer to warm up. The chicken was so dry and the batter was hard. Almost inedible. 

I tried the yakisoba once and it wasn't that good either. The soba noodle soup is pretty decent. Bottom line, the only thing here I recommend here is the happy hour special teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Still trying to find my go-to noodle bowl place after visiting Yoshi's. This place looked dive-ish, but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables, but the drive-thru was buzzing. 

My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought. 

We got back to my house, opened up the white wine, and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good, even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though. 

All in all, not my dream dinner, but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Yoshi's offers quickie fast food Japanese food at reasonable prices. The happy hour deal is great: $2.77 for a teriyaki bowl with rice (Every day from 3-5 PM). It's a very basic bowl with white rice, chicken breast and teriyaki sauce. It was made in a short amount of time and we were out in no time. I did notice that they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine so you can have a custom beverage with your meal here.

The interior is a bit dingy and faded, and the atmosphere isn't the most welcoming but if you want a cheap meal this is a good option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Service is a solid 2, food maybe a 3.5. Rounding up since the $2 happy hour Teriyaki Bowl is a pretty good deal and it's right up the street from my ivory tower. 

Considering there aren't many options for me and my half hour lunches downtown, could be a lot worse."}
{"text":"This place has ok food, would come here because it was closer to me. Now I make the drive to Tokyo Express instead. They really upset me one day when they were clearly open but would not serve me via drive thru and demanded that I come inside if I wanted food. Of course I drove off in a fit and hungry haha."}
{"text":"Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl \"white meat only\" and ended up with a bowl of fat, gristle, skin, cartilage, and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the \"white meat only\" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that, ever. 

If you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit, go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand, but it's got veggies, delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor), rice, and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl. 

I'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all."}
{"text":"This fast Asian-American food is awesome. 

Seriously, come here for lunch. In mere minutes you can enjoy a wide range of dishes, from tofu and veggies with a tasty curry sauce, to sesame chicken and cream cheese puffs. It's not anything fancy, obviously, but it's better than big chains they compete with. By a LOT. There's even a drive-thru! There's even a *happy hour*, where you can get some rather inexpensive terriyaki chicken. There's something here for everyone."}
{"text":"I now know how my Hispanic friends feel about Taco Bell. It was almost embarrassing being the only Asian person in the place.  
I went to Yoshi's Restaurant trying to stay as unbiased as possible.  I try and give all restaurants a shot, why not its close to my house.  

I can't give a three star review because Yoshi's is below average, 1 Star for keeping the place some what clean and 1 star because I'm nice.  The food seems to be inspired by Japanese cuisine but is a poor example for food quality and texture and taste.   

I do not recommend people subject themselves to this type of food. Japanese chiefs pride themselves on the quality, taste and presentation of its food, there are a few restaurants located with in a few miles."}
{"text":"Sumo bowl 5.79 special is chicken teriyaki and orange chicken on rice. Plenty of sauce. Side bar, by free style Coke machine,has lemon slices, green onions, chili  +. Also iced tea (not brewed) and free wifi. Great for quick lunch.Ask for key to use the bathroom. Medium 20 ounce drink 1.76. I will be back.. good food-good portions-good deal. I really wanted to rate 3 1/2, but worth 4 for a quick, good meal, decent price."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for the happy hour chicken teriyaki bowl, but it was a couple of minutes past the special cut off at 5pm. I thought I would ask anyway. If not, no big deal, but I would get something besides teriyaki chicken. 

I asked about the special, and the girl behind the counter said she would ask her manager if they could do one more, and disappeared to the back. When she returned she said the manager OK'd her to do one more, but I would have to wait for the manager to override the cash register. I handed the manager my card, and I noticed that she had rang it up for full price. I asked \"What about the happy hour special?\", but the manager said they were not doing anymore today. I looked at the employee and she just shrugged. Being on my way to a meeting, I didn't have time to argue.

Digging into the teriyaki chicken I found a lot of vegetables and little chicken. Worse yet, the rice was warm, but the chicken and vegetables were cold. Obviously this was cold, leftover food that they partially reheated, and tossed on top of some rice. This low grade dog food wouldn't even cut it for a discount special."}
{"text":"Great food! They even have a drive thru. The big sumo bowl is definitely recommended if you like Teriyaki chicken, Orange chicken, and white rice."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on the number of stars this rating should be.  We didn't go inside, so I can't really judge the place.  The drive-thru was full of pigeons having sex which made me tense and uncomfortable.  I didn't have to wait in the Aviary Burlesque House for too long before you took my order and let me get up to the window.  I thought the prices were high for cheap asian food but the quantity was there.  

The egg rolls were probably the best I've ever eaten.  I hate egg rolls but I would order one of those again.  My orange chicken, however, was tough and rubbery.  The orange flavor was fine, but those pieces of meat had been sitting out a LOOOONG time.  Too bad too...

I may go back and try something else in the future...but for now, you suck."}
{"text":"3-5 teriyaki chicken over steamed rice $2.77. The bowl was amazing. Plenty of chicken with the right amount of sauce. And the sauce had good flavor. The rice was good too which is rare. The egg roll and 3 piece gyoza were $1.50 each and both done nicely. The sauce that came to dip was gross tho. But I usually just eat them without sauce. Also got a 4 piece CA roll for $2.30. Although good not as good sushi as Ichi Bowl. I'll likely be back at least for the chicken. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"I have been there many times. It is close to my work so I eat there quit often.  They mainly serve rice bowls and you can get an egg roll on the side for cheap. They're nothing outstanding but the food is decent and fast."}
{"text":"Food was good, but thought it was a little ridiculous that we waiting in like from before happy hour ended but when we pulled up to the order at 5:02 they wouldn't honor the half off deal. Not a big deal but just think if we were waiting in like and the person in front of us took forever that we should have been able to get it at happy hour rate."}
{"text":"Walking in the doors at Darbi's was already a great feeling of the restaurants culture. It was like walking through the door of a relative or loved ones house - it felt comfortable. 

Despite, it's busy business, we were seated quickly and out on the patio as we had asked! The service was prompt, real and added to the comfort feeling. 

The food portions are HUGE! Come hungry. This place is one of my favorites and I will be returning again!"}
{"text":"So surprised at this place. I generally won't try new restaurants but this place was well worth it. Ate here twice and impressed both times. Food always came pit fresh. Best place for the value."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why people keep going back to Yoshi's!  I ate it once.  ONCE.  It was right across the street from work (the Indian School & Central location) and everyone went there everyday.  So, I figured I would try it.

Now, I ordered chicken, but I'm really not sure what meat it was OR what part of the chicken it was from.  It was really string-fatty-grizzly.  Teriaki sauce was good and the rice was ok, if a bit *too* sticky for my liking."}
{"text":"This place used to be half way decent but has gone soooo down hill. The chicken has become almost inedible and the staff isn't especially helpful or knowledgeable about what they serve. God forbid you try to get extra sauce. Seriously I have even paid for extra sauce and they won't give it to me. I can't wait till they go out of business and they put something good here."}
{"text":"I would say it is comparable to Kyoto Bowl.  This particular location has a drive-thru window.  The menu is pretty basic, nothing too special.  Low price for a quick, fast-food lunch.

The exterior is kind of dingy, can't elaborate on the inside.

3-star for a Fast-Food Japanese bowl place."}
{"text":"Yoshi's was not bad, but it wasn't really that good either.  It get's three stars though for the delicious egg rolls.  They were big and packed with pork and veggies.  Good stuff, but pretty greasy.  The rest of the menu was fairly so-so.  The options were pretty much chicken or beef covered in some kind of sauce.  I got the yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken.  It was actually pretty good once you mixed it around.  The noodles were mixed with veggies like carrots, zucchini, cabbage, and onions and drenched in a very tangy citrus soy sauce.  The chicken however, was just placed on top with no sauce or anything.  Kind of weird.  I enjoyed it until about half way through when the sauce became too much for me to handle.  I'll just drain in next time.  I will probably be back, but maybe just to order way too many eggrolls to gorge on."}
