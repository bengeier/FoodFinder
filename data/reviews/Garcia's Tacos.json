{"text":"The tacos here are by far the best I've ever had. The tortillas are hand made and the meat is delicious . I love this taco truck . He doesn't skimp on the meat either like others do."}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Mexican food in the Medford/Phoenix area! My favorite thing to order is their chicken burrito, which includes beans, rice, and an amazingly good pick salsa. The owner is also really friendly and gives a discount for high school students."}
{"text":"I've been eating at the taco trucks of southern oregon for 20 years,  this one is my favorite.  The owner is great,  the food is fantastic and the prices are reasonable.  Even my 8 year old,  who is very picky,  loves the burritos here.  And you can pay with a card!  Huge bonus,  as many places are cash only."}
{"text":"I've tried the tortas from El Tapatio's, Geno's and Garcia's food truck. Garcia's makes the best tortas out of those three. I wish they would include avocado, but the bread and the protein has the best flavor. Tacos are good too! Great, fresh ingredients. The food truck seems to always be open--every weekday. Right off 99, look for their canopy and picnic table, and pull right in!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best taco trucks in southern Oregon. Real deal tacos with homemade tortillas and their breakfast burritos are awesome as well. They also open at 8am while most of the other trucks don't open until 10am."}
{"text":"Where i live there are tons of taco trucks.  I have tried them all.  The are many great ones but none of them has ld a candle to this one.  The homemade tortillas are perfection.  The meat is plentiful and the salsas are very flavorful.  The father and son that run it are very nice and personable.  I wish this was located near my house.  My kids wanted to rat here everyday for the 10 days we were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We just recently tried their tacos and quesadilla for the first time and we are instantly cooked! Handmade tortillas, generous portions and delicious flavor! Not to mention the friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"THIS!  I LOVE taco trucks......and this is simply the best there is.  I don't say it lightly....because I've literally had every taco truck in the valley....(and continue sampling). Some have their high points, and I'm a fan of several.

While I also love the sit-down place down the street, (because it is easier to get to with the fam), no other place near Meddy makes tacos and tortas as good as this.  You're not gonna get beer......and there's only a picnic table out front on the highway for \"ambiance\".....but if you want FOOD.   The BEST food.  And that want includes tacos, tortas, or a loaded burrito, then this is the place-hands down.

The family that runs it puts a ton of love and care into what they do.  The salsas are always fresh and just amazing.  The handmade tortillas are what you have always wished for.  The meat......well......just try and not fall in love with the carnitas or asada.  I defy you.

When they opened a couple years ago, the owner told me that he meant to be the best taco truck the Valley had.  I smiled nicely, and said I was sure it would be good.

But it's not just good.  He has continually proven, over and over, that he and his family are up to the task.  I literally eat lunch here at least once a week.  In fact, I arrange my work schedule just to do it.  Yeah.....it's THAT kinda good!

I fear this truck ever leaving.....and my heart skips a beat when I see it has moved. (They take it home to clean and restock). One day, I will reminisce with the owner as he has a storefront somewhere-if that is their goal-about the best taco truck ever.  Garcia's definitely made it."}
{"text":"Handmade tortillas, normal size ones at that and a good quantity of meat.   What else do you want from a taco truck. 

I have eaten the burritos and the street quesadillas (callejeros) and they have  been great.  The Callejeros are  packed with melted cheese and meat of your choice. 

I had horchata with my meal and it was refreshing.   It wasn't to sweet but the flavor of the cinnamon, vanilla and rice had a good balance.  This was definitely homemade horchata and by it not being over sweet I was able to savor it more with its flavors. 

I got the chicken adobado and it was so good.  The chicken was very well marinated and had that asado taste you can only get from a fire grill.  Definitely on par with the best pollo adobado I've had. The asada was good but a tad bit overcooked, still delicious though."}
{"text":"These guys have EXCELLENT, DELICIOUS, food! The tortillas are homemade too. Their customer service was friendly and appreciative too.  We stopped by on a whim, and it's out of our way, but there's no match-we'll be coming back here for our cravings!"}
