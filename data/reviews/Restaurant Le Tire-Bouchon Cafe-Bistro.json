{"text":"Un restaurant caché...  Un petit bijoux à Boucherville.  Style français marocain.  Qualité prix excellent. Ambiance et déco légèrement dépassée"}
{"text":"Très bon, ambiance, le personnel, le chef cuisinier et surtout les plats. La présentation et le goût qui contient une explosion de saveurs. Le patron très aimable a fait visiter mon petit garçon la cuisine durant notre première visite. Il ne l'est pas obligé de le faire mais c'était des petits gestes simples qui nous fait retourner souvent à ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Just twenty minutes outside of downtown Montreal, you will find LTB, an urban chic hole-in-a-wall upscale - yet humbly unpretentious sophisticated restaurant - in a subtle and otherwise very ordinary strip mall in Boucherville. People drive from far to eat here and it's not unusual to be sitting in the company of sports and entertainment industry professionals and personalities. The food is a fusion French and Moroccan; with a local flare.  All ingredients are organic and locally sourced.   Our lunch started with a organic local greens mesclun salad and Bastilla - a Morocan baked filo dough with minced beef, cinnamon, nuts, powdered sugar and orange pesto base sauce; this dish is an orgasm on a plate, a definite must try!  The Bavette de boeuf which is a fancy French way of naming a beef flank steak was exceptionally tender and cooked to perfection, served with organic asparagus, roasted onions green beans and potatoe Au jus.    Our waiter insisted that we try a the house's signature secret dish that is not on the menu: Wild salmon filet baked inside an orange infused dinner filo pastry with Mandarin and pumpkin spread:  My tastebuds were on cloud nine #FoodPorn at its best!!!  We ordered the Morrocan Orange infused peppermint tea and, to our surprise, it was an experience seeing it prepared right in front of our eyes:  a ton of fresh peppermint leaves and spices in boiling water served in a traditional and artsy Moroccan Kettle and glasses.   The mini sweet baklava and biscotti nut bites accompaniment were a nice touch.  No wonder people drive from far  to experience LTB's exceptional food and hospitality, definitely true to all the hype! #NewRavingFan #FoodPorn"}
{"text":"Jamais déçu.    Aujourd'hui au diner, ce fut le boudin noir et le risotto... quel délice, ça goûte le ciel.    Un des meilleurs rapport qualité/prix de la rive-sud.    Le service est de haut niveau.  Y'a pas mieux.   J'ai même réservé par internet.  Bravo les boys et les girls."}
{"text":"Très bon service, repas impeccable et carte des vins très intéressante.  Nous avons passé une superbe soirée!"}
{"text":"We can't read French so they printed an English menu just for us. Long wait for everything but it was nice and pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in Boucherville, Le tire Bouchon was a great discovery, the decor is nice and they have a beatifull terrace. The menu offers you a good variety,  i hesitated a long time before making up my mind.. I started with an appetizer of grilled zucchini with goat cheese served with babaganoush  (an eggplant spread ) the mix of flavors was amazing.  Then i continued with a Paella with mussels, shrimps, fish and chorizo,  it was delicious, i am very difficult when it comes to paella, i have to say this one was up there. I finished my meal with profiteroles,. The trio of creme Brule or the sorbet trio were also very tempting."}
