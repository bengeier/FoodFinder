{"text":"Tragic nachos. Just tragic. No redeeming attributes. So un-lovingly assembled. Salsa was watery mush (from a jar) with overpowering amount of cumin. Portion was small. Cheese was sparse and largely unmelted and still in shredded straight-from-the-Kraft-bag form. Guacamole was additional $2.50 for a tiny plastic dipping container of store-bought paste. No tomatoes, scallions or other toppings. Just chips, cheese and jalapeños with sides of the watery salsa and sour cream (and optional guac). Oh, there was some sad shredded lettuce sprinkled on top. Blah."}
{"text":"Love it!
I always get the pork sammich. Damn i dream about that dish! The avocado is always ripe ( a rarity), the pork is tender and the sauce is great! Yum yum!
They have lots of specials during the week and great beers on tap. The patio is super tiny but great for people watching! I also enjoying counting the cocks when I walk in! The atmosphere is great, laid back, spacious and friendly! Never had a bad meal or server and here!
 Skip the newly opened giant ass next door and head to the Giant Cock!"}
{"text":"The Jersey Giant used to be my favourite pub in Toronto. I'd been here four times over the past two weeks and the food, drink and service was good, but it's a case of fifth time unlucky I'm afraid. I'm here now, honestly feeling a little disgusted with how I'm being treated. 

Every time I go up to the bar to get a drink, the so-called waitress, who hasn't approached me once in two hours, turns her head as soon as we make eye contact and pretends to be busy doing something - ANYTHING - else. She must have more important things to do, like scribble something on a bit of paper and dry glasses - she did that. 

Eventually a regular gets the attention of the barman by throwing a beer mat in his direction - he didn't notice the 6'4, large man standing at the bar, but he noticed a beer mat. He walks over to me with the enthusiasm of a death-row prisoner walking the green mile and shoots me with a look that says, 'I'm just letting you know that I fucking hate you too.' \"One more cider,\" I say to him. I'm so far past the point of saying please and thank you. He's half a foot from the fridge but he does a bunch of other stuff first - again, very urgent matters, such as putting mustard and ketchup on empty tables - and two minutes later I get my can. 

I'm trying quite hard to figure out why I'm being treated poorly here. Is it because I only tipped 15% for my food during the previous three times? Sorry but I'd been in the country two weeks and I was told that was the average percent. Is it because I'm sitting on the couch and not at the bar? Sorry but I have no desire to speak about ice hockey, Syria or Donald Trump. Is it because it's a British pub and I'm Irish? Who knows. I really have no concrete idea why, but there is a definite dislike for me in this place. It's a good thing I didn't order food or I'd probably be picking pubes out of my teeth for the next two weeks. It's quite odd. 

There's a dartboard down the end and I'm convinced that those two will put a picture of my face on the bullseye after closing time and spend an hour trying to hit it. Normally if I get a sense of dislike I can generally pinpoint the reason, but on this occasion I'm flummoxed. Is it worth thinking about? Not really because I'm never coming back, but cheers."}
{"text":"There were cockroaches on the walls and the bar tender told me to fuck off... Horrible experience"}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant on Saturday, December 11 around 11am with a friend to catch up over a casual pub lunch.

The drinks took forever to start off, and the guy that was serving us was gruff. My friend asked a question about the menu and the guy just walked away from the table. 

The red haired server with tattoos was very busy attending to her tables and the stocky server was slow to attend or respond to our needs. 

My friend ordered chicken wings and after the long wait to get the order, she asked for blue cheese dip. It came after she finished eating her wings. 

Then to add insult, I had to sit and watch her eat the wings because my soup did not come until afterwards.
 
When her main arrived, the BLT was cold. My friend told the server that it was cold. His response was that it was a cold sandwich. In addition to that, she asked for the French fries to be substituted for sweet potato fries. He brought regular French fries. Then he took then away and brought the right fries which were soggy and cold.  Bad service and bad food.  Very disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Cozy pub. I like the comfortable couches and modern lighting fixtures. Tables are small but service is quick and friendly. Food is average. For dinner I ordered the steak and mushroom pie with roasted potatoes and vegetables. I liked how tender the steak in the pie itself was, but the crust of the pie was smothered in gravy before it came to my table and was soggy. Taste was good however. The vegetables were bland and required a good pinch of salt. 

I came here prviously with some friends to grab a drink and chat and the \"Jersey Giant\" did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came on a whim because we were craving some fish & chips and happened to walk by it on our way to a different eatery. Never been here before for food, just a couple of times for drinks (but many years ago). Our food was really good (the shepherd's pie and the fish & chips), although a bit pricey for my liking. 

One suggestion: they should remove the carpeting. It smelled really musty, like years of old beer and socks. A bar shouldn't have carpeting."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a beautiful Saturday afternoon for a feed of fish and chips. Being an English pub I thought it should be good, which was confirmed by our (very nice) serve. I thought, it better be good for $17.99!! 

Very disappointing. The fish was like a halibut steak instead of haddock or cod. It was dense like meat, and not flaky because it was overcooked. The beer batter was ok and crispy enough but the fish inside was tough and not very hot. Chips were also not very crispy or hot -- not sure if they were fresh.

To the server's credit, she first offered something else and then came back to let me know she took the fish and chips off our bill. So that was good. Maybe it was just an off day but I won't be back to try it again.

P.S. A little cup of coffee was $2.50! Sigh."}
{"text":"I come to this pub for lunch.  On the board have a lot of good deals ranging from soup to sandwiches to burger.  I order a draft and a beef burger with mushroom.  The burger tastes very good. The meat quality is above average and is cooked just medium.  The waitress is very fast in servicing, probably due to she is the only one serving us for all tables near the door.  The décor is very standard for a pub."}
{"text":"An okay place.  I like how it looks inside.  There is a pool table in the back that it's pretty much impossible to play in fear of stabbing people walking by or sitting in the back.  For someone who like to play, it is very frustrating.

Food is okay, nothing special.  Staff are okay as well.  Will definitely not be the time of your life but from other places that are near by, I like this one the best."}
{"text":"Let's face it.  If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.

BUT, if you are looking for \"that place\", that place that the locals go to, that's consistently good, a great place to watch the latest game and enjoy a relaxing night out, then this might just be the place for you.  

It sure is for me. On any given week, when the work week has taken its toll, there is one place I know I can go to around the corner where frankly, they know my name and my drink! (Spoiler alert,...it's a lame-assed, non-alcoholic, delicious tall glass of cranberry cocktail,...but they know it).  Yep, this is Cheers.  They'll take care of you.

And if you do go, while I find most of their menu to be a consistent selection of pub-style comfort food, my latest obsession is their fish tacos.  Damnit.  Now that I've written that, I want one.  

So, if you're in Old Town and want a cozy place to chill out for a while, with some good food, a pint and maybe take in a game, I definitely recommend checking out the Giant.  They're always glad you came, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best of the blue collar bars Toronto has to offer, as of now.
So far this is one of two place that resembles home.
The staff are friendly and not afraid to have a conversation with you.
The 5 dollar Wednesday burgers are as good as I have found to date.
I still don't understand the Canadian laws that require burgers get cooked to hell but its not my country and I can only do as the say.

They have great beers on tap and have some really good deal through the week. Hacker-Pschorr are 2 for 10 on Wednesdays.  Thank you Jersey Giant for not making me pay strip club prices for beer while in Toronto.

I've not had too much other than the burgers but I've seen the same customers on several occasions.  I was told its a chain but I would have never know.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious, and the sangria was spot on! Great value for money. The service was a bit sloppy, but the waitress was accommodating and changed our wrong order without us even asking. Do yourself a favour and order the cheese quesadillas!"}
{"text":"A great little neighbourhood pub if you're looking for super casual and cozy. The drinks are very reasonably priced, and there are always daily specials for food and drink.

I'm reading a lot of bad reviews about the Jersey Giant regarding the food and I'm a little surprised. I've eaten here 3 times now and I have no complaints!

On Monday, they have a wing special - 10 wings for $10 or 15 wings for $14. Comes with a serving of fries. Both were great, especially the fries here. We also tried the fish tacos which were decently tasty.

On another day we ordered the fish and chips when it was on special for $11.99 (with drink purchase). It was a really generous portion of fish with a perfectly light crisp beer batter. 

My hubby said he had the poutine before and loved it.

All in all, a solid place, but obviously for casual fare and it's not for some of the uptight patrons (which may have written some of the reviews). For example, if you know there's only one server working their butt off, cut them some slack! Big deal if you had to go to the bar to order? You never know if someone called in sick or something, and it's really not the server's fault if they're under-staffed either. Have a heart, and get up for some exercise every once in a while!

Maybe I enjoy it here more so because I am not coming in with the expectation of 5-star service (although I've always had good friendly service from all servers and bartenders here)."}
{"text":"I know some would consider four stars a little high for the Jersey Giant but something just feels right when I drink here - probably a personal thing I guess. A great place to unwind or reflect on life. 

BEER options are rather good, something for everyone. (Note - this is not a \"craft\" beer pub) I love that they have Maisel's Weisse on tap - you don't see it too much in the city (I personally consume kegs of this stuff when in Germany). You get all the irish pub taps, one rotating local craft tap, a house selection, a couple Mill Street choices and some bigger international brands. 

SERVICE has been excellent on all my visits. Very friendly staff who always know when your ready for the next pint. Very consistent - I guess not being super busy helps on this front.

ATMOSPHERE & DECOR - Somewhat dated for sure. This is defiantly not the latest trendy pub!!!!! It feels / looks like an old style pub, but not dirty. I like the couch seating. They have a pool table room in the back. The bar is also very dark.

MIXED clientele for sure - everyone from students, suits, tourists, the elderly and many folks enjoying a beer on their own at the bar.

FOOD is standard pub selections. Never tried it myself but from what I can see, would probably be 2-3 star at best. Come for the beer & quiet time.

Conclusion - I like it (visited three times in the last two weeks). A perfect place to unwind after a crazy day at work. Not for the hipsters, trend setters or decor lovers (and that's OK with me).

{"text":"This is a casual pub downtown that serves quality food and beer at a reasonable price. I usually go on the weekend for breakfast or lunch and never have an issue with seating.  Try the Toronto Burger - Bison, blue cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and still can't tell whether i like this place or not.  there is some seriously confusing decor- again, i'mnot sure whether i love it or hate it.  but i'd come here if i was trying to avoid my regular spots in the neighbourhood.
really, not memorable in any way but not offensive either.  try it if your bored."}
{"text":"Good local spot - a bunch of us use it for casual lunches etc....very good food: I'd say a notch or two above standard 'pub-grub'.

Beer selection is varied, and seems to offer a decent spread of options.

Decor is standard \"sorta-British-pub-thingy\", not that I care much, to be honest.  I'm there for a pint, a bite and to yak w/friends!

Service quality can vary a bit from time to time, but show me a place that doesn't have that issue...

All in all, a great place for a casual get-together...will be back: again and again!"}
{"text":"First time I got to Toronto was not to have alcohol whatsoever. I was walking around the area looking for a place to eat  so I ate a pub instead over a 24 hour diner. Had the fish and chips w/ non-alcohol drink. $9.99 isn't bad for a Thurs. Special."}
{"text":"Please remember to serve your customers Jersey!  It was a Friday night that I came here with my boyfriend, excited to watch the hockey playoffs.  They had 2 for 1 Guinness pints, which was an additional lure.  But it took a good while to get menus and for the server to notice us.  My boyfriend had to keep going to the bar to get drinks the rest of the night and even started cleaning our tables.  We understand that they were short-staffed but we were making the effort to be understanding so the least they could do is acknowledge it with some kindness.  But we got no love from this place.  We had passable calamari and beef dip sandwiches.  It was edible and we were so hungry from waiting so we ate them.  Definitely not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Jersey giant is a quiet little place to grab a beer or a quick appetizer at. I love the big sofa chairs and couch that allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy your frosty cold beverage! 

The inside reminds me of an English throwback old school pub for sure! I dig it alot! The people here are rather friendly as well and they do offer a decent tap list as well!

I'd definitely come back in to enjoy a cold sudsy brew and a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"It's a pub with a pool table. On a Wednesday night it was not full but definitely alive. I usually don't see so many people at a pub on a Wednesday. 

The food: 
We had the daily special which was $6.99 for burger and fries. We also got 2 lbs of wings.  It's pub food...what can I say? It tastes good but it's not going to blow your mind. The wings I found to be a little scrawny. It didn't feel like 2lbs. At $18, I felt it should have came with fries or something. From now on I'm sticking with wings night if I want wings. The chipotle sauce tasted more like BBQ sauce. Still delicious of course. The burgers were adequate. Patty was a bit dry. Perhaps a little overcooked? The buns were awful. It was like chewing on rock. 

The rest: 
It's your typical pub atmosphere. Not much to say. They have decent selection of beers at reasonable prices. It's a decent place to chill and talk about whatever. I don't exactly walk into a pub expecting amazing food. I'd come again if I'm in the area. The prices are generally reasonable. The daily specials all seem like great value. I looked around and it seemed like most people got burgers and fries too."}
{"text":"They have a pool table - that is cool.  Not much else is, though.  My buddy was raving about this place, but I was really disappointed.  He recommended that I try their Stiegl on draft.  The bartender felt so bad after he saw the face I made when I sipped it, that he tossed it out and gave me a Kronenburg instead.  That must have been a bad line or something.  There were not very many people here and honestly it was dead."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Caesars r excellent! Go here to drink. Bartenders are awesome. Not their fault that the food is unedible!"}
{"text":"Well, they don't seem to have done any renovations to the front of the house, just the kitchen. It's basically the same well-worn dive - and I mean that in a good way."}
{"text":"I came here randomly looking for a place to eat. I had the chicken pot pie and the Jersey burger. The food was okay. The chicken pot pie tasted good but the fries for the burger was really over cooked. The burger meat itself was also burned a bit on the outside."}
{"text":"A lot of the reviews talk about food. The place looks pretty beat up.I wouldn't think to order food here. It's a good place for some drinks with friends, though. There's a pool table, a juke box, the prices for drinks aren't too bad for the area, the bartender is friendly, and it's usually not so loud/packed you can't have a conversation."}
{"text":"we came here the afternoon spain  litterally spanked italy in the euro cup. now im not a big soccer fan, but my girlfriend lives and dies by it, so i tag along. anyway we had a fantastic time on the small patio.. enjoying numerous drinks  and a great atmosphere.  what stood out for the both of us  was the attention to service the waitress showed. not once did we ever have to ask for anything... she was simply there with a smile and the next round.. seemingly as we needed it most.  and made our afternoon a very fun one.


 id highly reccommend the patio here.. especially when shes woking it!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Jersey Giant is one of the more un-assuming places in this area of town. It's a pretty low key pub with decent food and a nice selection of beers on tap.
Pitchers are under $20 for import or premium brands, and the food is all decently priced and pretty good as well. I've enjoyed the nachos on numerous occasions, and the Cubano sandwich is quite good. Pork tenderloin with bacon and avocado sauce on a bun, tasty stuff indeed. Last time I had wings and ribs and it was along the standard pub quality.

The front half is more dining area, typical tables and chairs, middle of the room has a good sized bar, and then in the back by the bathrooms there is a small room with a pool table, dart board, and jukebox. There is also a small patio out front that seats a couple small tables, but like most downtown patios, the real estate fills up quick. 

While this place is unpolished and not really an impressive place at first glance, it is good for some lunch or even after work drinks if you're not looking for something with the corporate stiffness associated at most of the other places in the area, which is pretty much the main reason I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Typical run of the mill pub.  Great patio if you don't mind being surrounded by old farts smoking their way to an earlier death.

We only stopped here for beer, and it was ok - it was 30 degrees and we wanted something cold to drink and it fit the bill.  However, I wouldn't order food on this patio, it's crowded and it's overrun with folks who can't sit through an entire meal without running outside to grab a ciggie between courses.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here with friends from school. The beer selection is great. The specials are pretty good. Their burgers are amazing and their happy hour menu is amazing because you can get a bunch of appetizers for $3 or $4 each (smaller plate but so worth it). Pitchers of their Jersey Giant beer are only $14, can't argue with that! The servers are very nice people and I love that bartender who looks like Chris O'Dowd! I like to play pool and it's a decent price for the hour. We all usually sit at the tables near the back because it's quieter. My only complaint is I wish they would turn the jukebox volume down sometimes when they see there are different groups back there who are trying to have a conversation. Sometimes I don't want to hear people's terrible Miley Cyrus or death metal. If there's no one back there, then the volume doesn't matter to me. I really like this place though, wish they had a location closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Always a great place for pub grub and a drink, any time if the year. 

The Jersey Giant is the quintessential neighbourhood pub and bar. They have a pool table nook in the back, plus beat-up, but comfortable leather couches. The Jersey is great for pre-theatre dining, or post-show drinks. Wendal is always on his game and keeps the orders flying through, up-to-the-minute. 

I also fell in love here, so yes I'm biased!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for over a year and have amassed a fair bit of experience with the local bars and restaurants. I use yelp frequently so I think it's about time I start to contribute. I want to start with the worst of the worst. 
A friend and I walked into this place on a rainy Sunday a few months ago. Mostly because we wanted somewhere comfortable and cozy, and we wanted to try someplace we'd not been before. First impression was okay; it smelled musty but that could be just because of the rainy weekend. We sat at the bar at first. There was a middle-aged guy behind the bar. He was having a conversation with a middle-aged woman at the bar. I'm not sure if she works here too but she was complaining loudly, rudely, and disparagingly about some customers that she'd dealt with earlier at her job as a server. We had to wait a long time for them to wrap up their conversation before we got any service. 
We then headed to the back to play some pool. There was a group of high-school aged kids playing so we sat at a table in the corridor and placed coins on on the ledge of the table. The kids that were playing saw and acknowledged this. After about a half hour (no, they weren't seriously playing, just killing time) another group of kids walked in and sat at a table near ours. When the last group's game was done, the new group jumped in and started playing with the old group. We spoke to them and said that we'd put money down and the next game was ours. We had a fairly polite conversation about it but they wouldn't back down. 
We went to the bar and asked one of the bartenders what the expected decorum was for use of the pool table at their establishment. He agreed with us that we had the next turn at the table and unless the table was reserved for a party at a specific time then patrons should take turns. We asked if the group that playing had a reservation for the table. He grabbed a writing pad, checked it, and said that there were no reservations for that day but that he was just the bartender and couldn't do anything about it. We asked to speak to the manager. It turned out that the middle-aged guy was the manager. He was very dismissive. He said they let their customers sort it out among themselves - note that this would be reasonable if you didn't have  high school kids loitering in your bar. I asked what they would do if a group won't share the table and have no reservation. In reply he said well they do have a reservation so I can't do anything. This was obviously a lie seeing as the bartender had checked the reservation schedule.
At this point we'd had it with his attitude and poor service so we paid out tab and went elsewhere. 
Terrible service. Bad atmosphere. Bad clientele, Smells bad."}
{"text":"I came here when I was traveling in the area. The service was mediocre at best; my friend and I walked into the restaurant and were unattended for a good 5-7 minutes. We were finally seated outside, but the arrangement made for a really tight situation. The food was typical bar food, so nothing special. The most entertaining part about my time at the restaurant was watching the waiter and manager prevent the table next to us from drinking under age.

There are many more restaurants on Front St. that I would suggest you check out before this one."}
{"text":"Just by the St. Lawrence market is this popular pub. As a first timer walking in, I would say it definitely has a great pub vibe.  One of those places you hang with your buds on a weekend. I can absolutely see that.

However, playing pool in their back section was a bit of um....an unforgettable experience. It wasn't that the pool table was not in the best shape or that the room wasn't big enough to house the table making it interesting shooting. More so because you may end up stabbing men with your stick as they walked out of the washroom. The icing on the cake for me was the lovely strong scent of pee emanating  from the women's washroom. Oh, it was killing me every ttme the door opened. I was informed it was much better now because of renovations. I can't imagine before.

Food was pub fare. Greasy and meant to just have something in your stomach as you drank the beer. This makes total sense. I rarely go into a pub expecting food to be good.

I think this is the place for you if you want to sit and enjoy the game with a few drinks under your belt but other than that if you are expecting more, you maybe disappointed."}
{"text":"Still standing and surviving from the break-up of the chef, owners, or whatever it was that happened to force some of the folks from here to go across the street and open up the Jason George (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-jason-george-toronto), this is a pub that I always have fond memories of.

I used to work for Canadian Stage (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-canadian-stage-company-toronto)and had to put in shows at the Bluma Appel Theatre at the St. Lawrence Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/st-lawrence-centre-for-the-arts-toronto).  As you can imagine, working for not-for-profit theatre does not leave you with a lot of money to splash around on nights out.  Step forward Jersey Giant with your $5.00 burger special.  They still run it to this day and I try to persuade those in my party that we should hit that place mid-week when the opportunity arises.

It's a pub pure and simple with decent food, and a good run of taps.  There's a pool table at the back of the restaurant and nooks and different levels that give the place an interesting dynamic.  Pub food and drink pure and simple.  It's easy enough to find.  There's a huge pub-storefront sign on the street with a huge rooster (the \"Jersey Giant\") on it, allowing you to make dirty jokes to your friends really easily.  Too easy, really."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday for the first time, Heard good things from colleagues who always come for their burger fix.

Ordered a burger and fries, service was great, Burger was decent.

Will i come again  - sure why not."}
{"text":"Good stuff for my first lunch in Toronto for business.  I wanted to walk around a bit and see the city and I had heard good things about the place.  Pretty empty for a late lunch on a weekday.  I had the Mill Street beer off the tap, a good choice, and one I stuck with the rest of my Toronto trip for local beers.  I ordered the Cuban Sandwich which I thought was going to be hit or miss as this place didn't seem like the kind of place that would do something like this well.  I was very happy with the selection in the end.  

The thing that made the place above average was the bartender, who could not have been more friendly and on the spot helpful.  The places strikes me as traditional British Pub and the food goes toward that as well.  Not being from Toronto I'm not sure when I would be back, but I'd be happy to visit again."}
{"text":"The Jersey Giant was a bit of a Diamond in the Rough.  It's definitely firmly in the category of dive bar...that dingy, damp, darkness that greets you as you descend into the basement makes that unmistakable.

What was also unmistakable were the excellent prices.  They had a burger and fries for something like $7 or 8, and it was in fact a good burger and fries.  They also had some decent pints on special for $4.50 or something like that.  I was overall pretty impressed with the food.  

The quality of the service was also pretty good.  We arrived after having had yet another douchey experience with the hostess at C'est What where she tried to put 7 of us in a table that seated 4 and most of the other open tables were somehow \"off limits\" for one reason or another.  The waiter at the Giant took great care of us, bringing us sample beers, etc.  He did disappear for a while when we wanted to pay but was otherwise quite attentive and friendly.  

I'll definitely be back to this place sometime.  The overall experience was pretty good."}
{"text":"This British Pub looks good from the outside but the food is horrible! The service also is moderate, there were only 1 poor guy as a server who had to do all the stuff. 

It was a Saturday night around 10pm. This time is one of the busiest time of all times I don't understand why only 1 server had to take all responsibilities. The guy gave us the menus  and disappeared. We saw him he was so busy with the bar. We waited to the extend we had to go to the bar and asked him to take our order!!! 

We ordered Onion Rings as appetizer. It was not that bad but when we asked for a sauce like ranch or tartar he said they don't have. He brought some Plum Sauce which was awful! Main courses were Rhuben Sandwich and Roast Beef Sandwich with blue cheese. Both were so greasy and tasted disgusting! I am not joking! 

The prices also are high compared to food quality... We asked the poor guy to bring us more water. We had to wait 10 minutes for him to bring 2 cups of water. 

Never never go back to this place! Everything was terrible: service, food, prices..."}
{"text":"My first time at The Jersey Giant was actually great and the Toronto Burger was impressive, but after returning last night and hoping for a great dinner, I was so disappointed. 

We were seated right away and we both ordered the specials of the night. On Wednesdays, they have a burger special for $6.99 with a purchase of a drink and they also had a fish and chips special (with drink purchase) for $9.99. We ordered both specials and calamari appetizer.

Our waitress took our drink order and left, assuming she would come back with our drinks. She forgot our drinks and took our food order instead.

We got our fish & chips and burger specials quickly and I had to remind our waitress that we ordered an appetizer. I wouldn't mind if she forgot to punch it in, but she gave us this lame excuse that she swore she rang it up but the kitchen staff disregarded it as a duplicate order. 

Something clicked when I heard the table behind me asking why they haven't received their food yet and they were almost done their beer. I heard the waitress apologize but then she blamed the kitchen staff again for messing up the order! Not cool. 

My boyfriend asked for some condiments for the burger and I asked for some tartar sauce for my fish. She never came back. I asked another server for tartar sauce and never got it. 

So my boyfriend ended up eating a dry burger with no ketchup, mayo or mustard and I just doused my fish and chips in the coleslaw and malt vinegar. 

The service sucked last night and even though I know it was probably a one time thing, it's enough to make me stay away."}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night. The bartender was very attentive and kind to give advice on things to do in the area while visiting. Was staying in a 5-star hotel nearby and honestly I wanted to cut the crap with the fancy hotel and snobby hipsters and enjoy a juicy cheeseburger and martini in the comfort of my Walmart clothing. Jersey's to the rescue. 

The food was quite a surprise too. Everything was fresh and tasty. I'm a bit hesitant with late night food orders but after a long day traveling in the car, this place did not disappoint. 

The large sofa and chair was quite comfortable! If you find yourself downtown Toronto just want causal, non-pretentious booze and bar food, I'd not hesitate in stopping in."}
{"text":"You know those little pink urinal deodorizer blocks you put on your toilets? When I walked in it smelled like that. I wasn't even drunk yet. When we did order beer, it was flat. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  had brunch with 5$ caesars today, generous portion / a good serving with friendly waitress - nice atomosphere - glad we wound up here - the Hot House was packed accross the street so we wound up here for a great brunch at a lot less cost - loved it."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend as we wanted to try something different from the businesses around the St Lawrence area. When we arrived we seated ourselves. I don't believe anyone noticed us until 5 minutes later and brought our menus. They have a lot of specials of the days and drink specials but it wasn't anything appealing. My friend and I settled for fish and chips and pulled pork tacos. My friend had no complaints about her fish but it wasn't anything special for the expensive price. I've had better and cheaper fish and chips. My tacos actually didn't even taste warm. The meat tasted like room temperature. Maybe my tacos are meant to be like that? Not sure. 

The decor is a little dated. If you're not looking for anything fancy and just grabbing a pint I would come here. The drinks you can't go wrong but I wouldn't order food here. Service was okay at best. Maybe just an off night?"}
{"text":"Great place for a laid back drinks night. It's relatively cheap for the area and 3njpyable if you want to watch the game or chat the night away! 

The good
- drinks specials
- central location to financjal district
- dead so you'll get a seat

The bad
-washrooms are not the nicest
- crowd is so so
- Food looked only ok
- drinks cheap but wine but pricy
-overall place uppity for what it was

Won't be back 100$ for a few drinks? No thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here for St. Pat's and wasn't disappointed.  Great Guinness pours.  Great fish n chips.  Great service.  ...and got a table right away!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Giant in quite a while, but this Sunday I decided to pop in to escape the gloomy windy rainy day.  I'm glad I did!  After a long day of touring around the city with my aunt, we were looking for a place to kick back and have a drink and a snack.  We each had a glass of the Valpolicella and we shared an order of nachos.  My aunt wanted chili, but I'm really allergic to MSG.  The server made a point of checking with the kitchen staff and she assured me it was MSG-less.  Taking my chances, I indulged and am pleased to say that I was just fine.

I've have been to the Jersey Giant many times and have tried all sorts of things on their menu.  Nothing has been mind blowing, but everything has been enjoyable.  It's comfort pub food, and there's nothing wrong with that.  The service is good, the portions are plentiful, and the booze selection is decent.

If it was closer to my home, I am certain I'd be there more."}
{"text":"Feels like a neighborhood bar. The Jersey Giant seems to be about comfort and company. They are not trying to set the world on fire with fine furnishings and fancy decor. The atmosphere is on the darker side; tv's at various spots; its pretty spacious with a small pool room in the back.

They had an interesting blend of pub menu items - burgers to poutine to shepards pie. Beer choices were pretty deep. I had the shepards pie and it was pretty good - but then again it's not rocket science to throw together mixed vegetables, hamburger and mashed potatoes.

The staff was friendly and the service was excellent.

I stumbled onto this place - I was looking for another pub called \"C'est What?\" and ended up in the Jersey Giant. I would considering another visit when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the worst restaurants in the area. If you can get past the odour of grease and sweat coming off of the regulars, who I would guess spend half of their disability cheques at this dump, then you're in for a surprise. The food is disgusting. That's all that is worth saying. Save your money, and that way your clothes won't smell when you leave!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends a few weeks ago. It's a very laid back environment here with a pool table at the back. You basically sit yourself and a waiter/waitress will come to give you a menu and take your orders. 

I ordered ribs and wings, my friends ordered chicken pot pie and the other ordered steak & mushroom pot pie. I must say, I really liked the ribs and wings. The wings and ribs were both so good. They were moist and for the ribs, the meat came right off the bones. It's definitely messy eating ribs, but it's so worth it.

My friends also liked their orders as well. 

To finish off, we got a creme brulee. This is actually the first time I've had a cold creme brulee. Not sure if it was supposed to be warm or not, but it tasted really good. Not too sweet and the top crust was just hard enough that it didn't break my teeth when I did eat the caramel top. I would definitely go back if I ever felt liek a creme brulee.

I would go back to try their brunch menu. It looks really good. I would go back to Jersey Giant if I ever wanted a laid back pub style dinner for sure!"}
{"text":"Any of their pot pies are fantastic, filling and downright, absolutely delicious homey food. You need comfort? Come here and indulge in rosemary potatoes and an array of market veggies. Probably the BEST pot pie that got me stuffed and content from the first bite alone. However, beware the tasty but not hearty reuban (not enough meat) the interior has character and is very chill. Speaking of which, there's a nook a few steps from the bar to get some business done. Free WiFi, reasonable drink prices, pool table in the back with darts. Definetely coming back on future date nights."}
{"text":"Poutine. That's all I gotta say. Poutine. And beer. I should say that, too. Good combination. As for the rest of the menu--it's well above average for pub food. Very laid back, comfortable and friendly place with nice staff. It's a nice break from the chaos of the St. Lawrence Market area outside."}
