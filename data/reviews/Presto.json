{"text":"First I have to say I've been coming here for over ten years! The pizza is so good! Light and fluffy crust. The wings are really good too but I always ask for them fresh. I would not suggest getting anything else because I've never tried anything else because the pizza and wings are bomb! I do bring my friends and family here they always love it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place instead of the national chains that my hotel recommended and I was not disappointed. 

The wings, first off, we're really good! Medium was spicy but not too spicy. 

The pizza was really good as well. Pepperoni was a bit sparse but bacon was well covered. 

All in all, a great alternative to the big guys."}
{"text":"The hot wings are outstanding. They aren't the kind of hot that is going to set your mouth on fire, but I really like the.  Their spicy bbq wing are also pretty darn good too. The medium and mild wings in my opinion are ok. I'd also rate the pizza as ok, and I doubt I'll get one of their calzones again."}
{"text":"Just okay.... had pizza and wings, that were not bad, but not great either. Had sausage and jalapeno pizza with bbq wings, wings were way to saucy, maybe to hide that they were not freshly cooked. Can't say too much about pizza ...just average."}
{"text":"This is written by my 11 year old niece.

My first time and I have to say I'm impressed! The crust is totally amazing and so awesome in my mouth! The cheese was a bit chewy though. I would still go back for the crust."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 3 years. It has always been the best pizza and wings hands down!!! You know it's good if reheated leftover pizza and wings  are edible!  I noticed they have more deals lately then what they used to offer. So a couple months ago we did our usual order of xl pizza with sausage and cheese and some medium and mild wings. Let me just say I was floored at how horrible this was!! It tasted cheap and had the texture of the tinos pizzas in the frozen part of the grocery store. Tasted like one of those from the microwave. We were shocked!! So shocked that I decided about 2 weeks ago again. I just wanted to see if maybe they ran short and borrowed from a different company. No. I am sad to say no. They did not borrow anything. So sad. Their quality has tanked lately. I gave 2 stars because I am hoping they bounce back from the horrible frozen pizza world they moved into. Come back presto!! Go back to your past supplier were the ingredients were top notch. I don't mind not having as many deals as long as the quality is there. 

P.S. Breakfast sausage crumbles IS NOT what I expect when I order a pizza with Italian sausage and cheese. They weren't even big crumbles. I'm telling you, tinos pizzas for $1 at frys (microwaved) taste the same."}
{"text":"Good winds, good pizza, good price!!  I wish they delivered to downtown but hopefully they will open a location near downtown!  ;) They are very good with customer service."}
{"text":"Very pleasant service. Delicious pizza. With 5 very picky pizza eaters, the 3 that were home to enjoy LOVED and raved about this pizza and said this is our NEW regular spot. The wings were absolutely finger licking good (however no fingers were or will be licked). I was very satisfied with everything this place has to offer. Will definitely be back. Not your average chain pizaa taste. A must try and a new FAVORITE."}
{"text":"This pizza is better than Pappa Johns , Pizza Hut and Domino's combined. I just wanted to try something different and was very pleased. The only Pizza I like better is  DiCarlo's Pizza in Avondale ."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings last night for dinner. Everything was really good! I asked for extra crispy wings and they were perfect. They said delivery would be around 50 minutes but it came in 35! Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"the best pizza in the phoenix area....i had to come back. my cousin is a beast at this!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything but a pepperoni and jalape√±o pizza but I love it. It's cheap too."}
{"text":"Good pizza ..better wings ...typical wing recipes and textures but definitely good food ...I got their flyer at my door figured I'd try them out ..nice staff phone ordered and very nice people ...looking forward to try other menu items soon ...I would have given a 4 but the pizza crust was a lil chewy...guess it all depends on your pizza style likings ... 5 star would of been best pizza ever tasted so this 3 star is definitely a solid 3 ..Thanks for the pizza and great service ."}
{"text":"Yikes...5 people ate here & no one was pleased. I hate giving bad reviews, but the pizza and salad were just bad. I like taking a gamble on \"dive/hole-in-the-wall\" type places, but this one turned up empty. Dive-like enviornomnet (which we are cool with--actually, looks like a converted Mexican restaurant). Just terrible food. Sorry."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that i DO personally know these fellas who own this pizza joint. 
They used to come into my work EVERY friday and they would give us a couple of pizzas and they are ALWAYS BOMB!!! 
They have a location on Cave Creek and Sweetwater (just south of greenway) as well...
But their location on Indian School is ALWAYS poppin'! 
Their sauce has that GREAT sweet taste to it that makes your mouth water when you think about it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley! Their vegetarian pizza is like no other, I cannot say enough good things about it! Their wings are very tasty as well. They often have coupons and the prices are awesome! Fast service, and great customer service!"}
