{"text":"Stopped here randomly while looking for a place to eat lunch and was pleasantly surprised. We both ordered sandwiches which were good and the prices were reasonable. We also tried their alfredo poutine which was to die for!"}
{"text":"I should have stayed away since they ruined my day. Was there 2 times, first time, average food, slow service, poorly trained staff. Second time, told I could only take one particular table and nothing else whereas the restaurant was empty. While trying to sit at that table they changed their mind and asked to sit at another one..."}
{"text":"J'y allais souvent AVANT qu'ils changent leur menu. Mon plat préféré était le ciabatta poulet-bacon qui venait avec une frite et salade césar. Mais maintenant pour le même plat, c'est au moins 4$ de plus. Ça n'en vaut vraiment plus la peine."}
{"text":"Repas très bon, mais service exécrable. On ne s'occupe pas de vous, t'attend 15 pour commander, 15 minutes pour ta soupe et on t'apporte ton plat principal sans te laisser finir ta soupe. Personne n'est venu voir si tout était correct. Après 30 minutes on a décider de se lever payer sans prendre notre dessert. Ca faisait +10 ans qu'on avait pas mangé à ce resto à cause du mauvais service, ca n'a pas changé..."}
{"text":"I have some family friends over at Varennes and we often go have breakfast or dinner at this mikes. The staff is very friendly and the food is great, the ambience is quite calm for a family restaurant, loved that. The food is great, (yes, I said it twice) nothing to complain about. Service was quick and the waitresses come often enough to refill my coffee."}
{"text":"Ganz ok für ein Restaurant in einer Mall. Pasta und 'Veal' schmeckten gut."}
{"text":"There is really nothing special about this place.  The food is good and the choices are decent. It's more of a Italian-American mix Good for catching hockey games."}
{"text":"Standard three star Italian-but-not-really-Italian 'ristorante' (cough) that you'd find in a mall.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing really authentic, either.  There's a huge choice on the menu and some good deals to be found on the combos. I liked how they thought outside of the box with the combos, instead of just offering main+salad+side or something, they offer half pizza, half pasta main dishes - really interesting and great for those (like  me) who couldn't decide what to have.  I went for the cheese and tomato mini-bruschetta-pizza thing with the spaghetti carbonara. There was a huge amount of bacon with the carbonara, which was a really pleasant surprise. The sauce was decent and not too heavy. The bruschetta/pizza was a tad on the soggy side, and very heavy on the cheese.  I'm glad I didn't order a full pizza, as I saw one going past and the crust seemed really thick, with, again, excessive amounts of cheese.  Service was ok in terms of friendliness, but very very slow despite the restaurant not being busy.  I'd be happy to go back again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Take out is crapWent on a Monday night  meet  under cooked, bread went an soggy  Fries under cook I would understand if it was 11 pm when there closing but it was 8:30pm I call them back tell me the boss is not there come back tomorrow  any ways it's suck will never go back  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Courteous staff were helpful. Many local tradesmen were parked in the lot so we knew there would be a good breakfast. I would go there again."}
{"text":"This place is always empty I don't know why I recommend the Thai chicken pizza it's a little on the Sweetside and it's also spicy I also tried to international pizza pretty good"}
{"text":"Eh,  Just average food. Very slow service. They drop off the food and don't return until halfway thru the meal. Horrific chicken parmesan.  Pass"}
{"text":"Les heures d'ouvertures sont ridiculement mauvaises, livraison incluse, les sandwichs et pizza sont très avares de garnitures pour le prix payé. Extrêmement décevant comme restaurant et succursale."}
{"text":"Mikes use to be the place to go about 15 years ago but has gone down a lot over the years.  Decent price and the food is ok but not what it use to be.  The service was very slow and it was fairly empty went there on a Thursday night around 9pm so no reason to take so long to serve.  We got 2 sub and they were lukewarm and the bread wasn't really toasted.  Wish they would go back to what they use to serve"}
{"text":"Never Again. Not worth going there if it was the last place on earth. Good was less than average. Overpriced. Empty and no one available to give you a good service. Plus you get a wrong order.  Never Ever again"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for delivery and I was a bit disappointed. It took more than an hour to get the food even though it's a five minute drive away and I didn't call during the lunch rush.  What's even more disappointing is that when it got here, my sub was all soggy and inedible. :("}
{"text":"Got the menu in the mail and decided to order. What the heck right.  Until you realize that you need to repeat the oder 3 times on the phone. Then having to wait over an hour for 2 submarines.   Honestly what has happened to the old Mike's you know the good subs and service."}
{"text":"We ordered pasta dishes. Portions were tiny and I had more oil in my plate than actual spaghetti! Service whatever. Will never go back and not recommend."}
{"text":"Rue St catherine is one of Montreal's busiest places all through the year. After a long day all we needed was a good cosy place and , Trattoria Di Mike's, also known as Mike's, was our choice.  Entering the restaurant, we couldn't but notice the waiters welcoming us with a wide smile and amicable way. Joel, our waiter for the evening showed us to our table and gave us the menu.. few minutes later, he came back and asked for our order... the place was crowded, we thought we were going to wait forever to get our food.. but fortunately, it did not take long... the order was fast, we even had an extra basket of fries for free. The Salad was not very tasty, the vegetables did not seem fresh, but the rolls were fruity and light, the onion rings were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The place was so welcoming that we were not at all in a hurry to leave.  Mike's is well known for its fondant which we highly recommend. Mikes menu includes a range of pizzas, pasta, sandwiches along with other exclusive italian specialties such as the famous Gondolas, haven't tried but we sure will the next time we go there.  The christmas songs put us in that joyful mood before christmas. The music was just loud enough that we could still manage to have a conversation with our friends without getting annoyed."}
{"text":"I ordered through the online delivery service justeat.ca. No complaints about the ordering process. Their website is clear and concise and placing an order is easy. Their communication about the status of your order is very good as well.  The order was for one all dressed large regular crust pizza and a Caesar salad.    The order arrived about 5 minutes before its scheduled time and the driver was friendly.  So far so good. Then came the so called Caesar salad. A foil plate filled with lifeless romaine lettuce leaves. No hearts! Hey Mike's....what did you do with the romaine hearts? Don't you know the lettuce is supposed to be fresh and crispy? Just the limp leaves and a small container of dressing. Oh yes, a few tasteless croutons. Absolutely nothing else. A classic Caesar at the very least has grated parmesan.  The pizza was good. Not great. A touch above Dominos or Pizza Hut but definitely not worth twice the price. Soggy crust. Average sauce. Pepperoni that needed to be cooked and not just warm and oily. The cheese on the pizza was good. I'll give them that.  So Just Eat - I was impressed with your service but I hope that the other restaurants that you have on your web site are better than this one."}
{"text":"...poorly trained stuff... took 40 minutes to get drinks, an hour to get breakfast... good luck trying it..."}
{"text":"Un classique, savoureux sous-marins, service courtois,ambiance relax.  Toujours aussi bon chez Mikes."}
{"text":"Le service est bon, courtois, bonne présentation dans salle à manger, le restaurent est propre et les salle de bain de même... Ce n'est pas mon restaurent préférer mais certaine chose sont délicieuse d'autre sans plus...  Y aller par votre propre opinion pour la nourriture , pour ce qui est des lieux moi j'ai apprécié , il y a petite terrasse sur le côté mais aujourd'hui trop frisquet ^^"}
{"text":"I like to come for lunch McGill special  Price and food quality are good plus they have a terasse and good drinks special  I like steak putin"}
{"text":"This is for an impromptu birthday lunch for my sister who lives in Contrecoeur, so I had no input in the decision to eat here.  I normally get Mikes Pizza in Ville St-Laurent as they are one of the few who deliver where I work. It's the only decent thing they serve. Aside from that, I always avoided this chain at all costs.  Now I know why: the failure to make Italian food. I can open a can of pasta sauce and can boil spaghetti noodles. But I should not pay $12-15 for somebody else to do this.  The most revolting of all dishes is the Parmigiana. Tiny overcooked breaded cutlets drizzled with a bit of cheese. The pasta on the side was cheap and mushy and the sauce tasted canned. Ugh  Paying for 5-6 people, it can add up to about $100 for downscale Olive Garden wanna-be chain food.  The service was really mediocre, we were forgotten for hours and the restaurant was so cold we had to keep our jackets on, but our feet were still freezing.  I normally never do this, but I had to ask one of those feedback cards that chains offer and give my 2 cents.  Is it going to work? Probably not, but if this review can cause people to eat elsewhere when in Varennes, then all the better."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The server asked for additional tip claiming that quebec has a law that we were obliged to give 15% of what we've paid for (we gave $10 for the tip). The server was rude and racist. There were missing items on our order too!"}
{"text":"You need to have the right expectations before eating here. It's in the mall, so don't expect something fancy. It's good food for the price, great portions, and friendly staff. Good place to go if you want to leave full and not break the bank."}
{"text":"For a breakfast place this was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by our food options. They did an adorable pancake smiley face for my little one. I had their version of eggs Benedict and it was delicious.  The loss of the star comes from when they failed to refill our waters the entire time we were there"}
{"text":"burned our appetizers and served them to us with no apology, we tasted 1 each and sent the rest back it was a brushetta dish, no one asked why we didn't eat it. We had Spaghetti and pizza the Spaghetti tasted like canned Spaghetti with the fakes parmesan cheese and the pizza crust was awful like they used a frozen roll or something, our entrees were served and no one checked to see if we needed anything throughout the meal. The server brought us the check and pointed to a pos and told us to check ourselves out, I couldn't figure it out so she had to come back and help and boy did that put her out, I would buy a can of chef boyardee Spaghetti and a frozen pizza next time and save $70."}
{"text":"Mikes is a chain resto that has changed for the worse progressively over the past decade. There was a time where I relished their subs to the point of an addiction as well as their awesome fries.   Every year or so, I give in and order from one of their chains, hoping for a return of their golden age and every year I get predictably disappointed again. This year it the same old song.  The ordering process is terribly quick and efficient. No qualms with that.  Got my food within 30 minutes, though the delivery driver needed directions. Seriously? We're 2014 folks, why are people delivering without a GPS? Heck, free apps like Google Maps or Waze do the job admirably. I shouldn't be telling you how to get to my place like it's the 19th century.  So, if I got my food within 30 minutes, how exactly is it cold? My 14 inch co-star sandwich was barely warm and it was close to 10 degrees outside. How is this even possible? Had to heat it up. The bread tasted old and the meat flavorless. Terrible sub, even by Mike's standards. Maybe they should be shielding the food properly for deliveries... or heck, maybe even dish out a bit more for fresh ingredients. It's an embarrassment.  The 9 inch all dressed pizza was the star of the show by being decent. Sauce was zesty and the dough actually seemed fresh. Nowhere close to other pizzas offered in my area... but it was actually edible.  The fries were dead cold, as if they just scooped up some fries lying around for the sucker getting the delivery. They were also undercooked and unsalted. What did I actually get?  The onion rings were about the worst type of onion rings one can be unfortunate enough to receive. Completely cold and greasy with no hint of crispiness or flavor beyond the grease. Once again, unsalted.  The price tag was about $35, no way shape or form equivalent to the value of the meal received.   All in all, this Mike's delivery was a disaster and I think it's due time to throw the pamphlet to this grub in the trash once and for all."}
{"text":"I went with a group of coworkers for a farewell party. I wasn't the last to order, but I was definitely the last to receive the food eventhough, I ordered similar food as my coworkers. I had to ask many times for my drink. My coworker also had to remind the waitress for my drink. I ended up getting it halfway eating my food. I had the fish and chips which was okay, nothing special. I didn't enjoy my fries much. My virgin mojito was okay as well. I tasted my coworker's calamari which was really good. I was quite disappointed with the service. It is in the basement of a mall, it is a fast food resto, but we made reservations in advance and I think they could have done a better job."}
{"text":"A fairly bad experience. My friend and I decided to have lunch here due to proximity. It looked bright and nice and it was fairly empty.   Our waitress was completely clueless. Everytime we asked a question regarding she said she didn't know. She'd go check on the computer and come back with an answer. When we placed our order she tells us she's never heard of that item. When we pointed it out she's like there's only one size and it's not offered in the size you want. (Mikes fix your menus!!!)   We ordered the waffle cut chips which were more on the burned side. However the dipping sauce was really good! We also had the vegetarian pizza which was slightly undercooked. We asked to switch some veggies for peppers which they didn't have.   We never got our glasses refilled with water. It took forever to get our bill. The whole service was slow which made this experience bad.   Although the place is clean, well decorated and good location I wouldn't go there for food again. There are better options in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Very average food and slow service during our recent Sunday lunch. My salad was soaked in dressing and rather plain.  Restaurant in a shopping mall."}
{"text":"Cher pour ce que c'est, service ordinaire, pour ce qui est de la nourriture elle était bonne .... mais trop dispendieuse. ..."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable.  Locals recommended hot sandwiches as the only things worth eating.  They tasted OK, the price seemed appropriate.  Wait staff at 3pm was very slow, took 2 hours start to finish."}
{"text":"L'endroit vient juste d'être rénové. C'est très bien et propre. La pizza est excellente. Par contre, les frites gaufrées étaient huileuses. La sauce sur les pâtes goûtaient trop la crème. En plus, on était une mauvaise journée où à court de personnel, le service était lent. Dans sa catégorie, cela reste quand même un bon restaurant pour satisfaire une table avec des gens aux goûts différents."}
{"text":"For a mall restaurant, I generally keep my expectations low, but this was definitely a pleasant surprise! It was also packed for a Saturday night with people of all ages.  The pizza was great with an interesting-looking crust, with pesto sauce. The pasta was also excellent. A glass of wine was a reasonable price.  Convenient if you're headed to a show across the street at Place Des Arts. You don't even have to walk outside to get there, just use the RESO!"}
{"text":"This place is not good. If you are only in Montreal for a weekend, don't waste a meal here. My group got a fair sampling of different menu items from pizza, to panini to gondolas and it seemed like everything was microwaved. The place is clean and conveniently located, the staff are friendly enough and the portions are suitable, but the food is really nothing to be even close to excited about."}
{"text":"Une chaîne de restaurants, la bouffe est la même partout ... Mikes ; on aime ou pas, on y va pour se dépanner ou pour se gâter dépendant des personnes. Par contre, ce qui distingue cette succursale est le service à la clientèle absolument génial ; il est constant, poli, agréable ... À chaque fois, peu importe l'heure, j'y ai été extrêmement bien reçu !!"}
{"text":"Cette soirée-là, je me suis demandé si ce n'était pas mon pire ennemi qui avait préparé la nourriture. Inutile de faire un long discours. C'était infecte! Il ne faut pas s'attendre à de la haute gastronomie chez Mike's mais quand même!... Que ce soit au moins mangeable. Les crevettes Alfredo de l'entrée, baignaient dans une sauce grisâtre. Les calmars frits... mon Dieu! Un spaghetti à peine égoutté et nappée d'une petite cuillerée était flanqué d'une salade César dont les feuilles avaient vieilli. Mon invité a opté pour la pizza au saumon fumé. À bien y penser, on aurait du la garder pour jouer au frisbee  l'été prochain."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I stepped into a Mikes but since I received a gift card, it allowed me to rediscover the chain.  Most Mikes restaurants have undergone a makeover in recent months, they have a new logo and simplified menu that still focuses on pizza and pasta dishes. The Place Versailles location is no exception to this rule, the decor is very modern and suitable for a casual sit down with family or slightly more upscale business lunch. I love the red, white and grey color combos, everything looks clean and bright. There is even a bar and smaller, closed off room that is perfect for group events.  I opted for the do it yourself \"Duetto\" option which mixes a pasta and pizza of your choice, for around 12$ it was very reasonably priced. I recommend the bruschetta rolls which are smaller pizza bites if you do not want a traditional pizza. These are fun and easy to eat as you can dip them in marinara sauce or drizzle the seasoning oils over them.  My partner had a submarine which was generously sized, and upgraded for a meat sauce poutine that was a real knock out. The sauce is so flavorful and the mix of curd and parmesan cheese added to that extra savoriness.   I noticed that the pasta dinner options are closer to the 20$ range and feature many of the same Mikes sauces that are widely available in grocery stores, therefore I'm not sure it would be worth it. They used to offer a great tortellini dish but this has now been removed from the menu.  I would stick with pizzas, sandwiches or the duo options for lunch. Great quality and value.  Bonuses: free wifi, tv screens to follow sporting events, and free refills on fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Food was okay. On par with say Olive Garden. I had chicken Alfredo linguini and my husband had the chicken parmigiana. It was good but nothing spectacular. Service was slow but friendly. They were really busy on the Tuesday night we visited. That might have contributed to the slow service. Probably wont go back during our week stay here in Montreal but if you like Olive Garden you will like Mikes."}
{"text":"What a dissappointment. We were there before but forgot what it was like and since we were driving by, we decided to try it again. I regret we did. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and my wife a spaghetti a la bolonaise.  The spaghetti was OK but not the best said my wife. The pizza was horrible. Let me remind the readers that I ordered a pepperoni pizza.  I could not believe what I got. The pizza was covered with a thick layer of cheese covering the whole pizza and the pepperoni was hard to find. Very tasteless. I complained to the waitress about it and her answer was that people complained that there was not enough cheese so now they just splatter more cheese.   Sorry Mikes.... Bad answer, bad service and bad food.  I heard that there is a new Mikes that opened in Lasalle. Too bad because he will have to pay for the one in Lachine because we will never go to another Mikes anywhere."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant. Food really sucks, especially the pizza. I don't understand why anyone would want to come here. Service is good though."}
{"text":"After an intense study session, my friends and I decided to come here to grab supper. It's a very small and cosy restaurant. We were directed to a booth and we felt very secluded, as if there were only us at the restaurant. (Meaning, the booth offered a very intimate dinner.)   Our waitress was extremely kind and she took the time to answer all of our questions without seeming annoyed.   All 6 of us ordered different meals. I ordered the superstar Poutine. I could barely finish it, but it was quite tasty. I hear that the bruschetta is to (figuratively!) die for! Two of my friends ordered the table d'hôte and got the dessert du jour. It was a delicious Boston cream cake. When we ordered, the waitress said that the piece of cake was fairly small, but when it came, it was much larger than what we excepted!   Paying was quick and simple and we were sent off with a few kind words. The only little hiccup was that the table d'hôte came with a coffee and we had to ask for it to go as we were leaving. Overall, it was a pretty great experience!   Oh, there's also a parking lot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service à la livraison et en salle aussi  Très bonne pizza j'aime bien elle au fruits mer  Les sous-marins sont très bon aussi :)"}
