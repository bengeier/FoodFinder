{"text":"This was my first visit and the food, service and atmosphere are amazing.  Hefty portions with great prices.  Guacamole is amazing. I'll be back for sure. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with food here. Give it try. You'll be happy. It's not your average Mexican restaurant. It's real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excited a new Mexican restaurant came to the area - paid a visit last night.  The salsa and cheese dip were very good. The chicken fajitas were ok - no sour cream or guacamole served with dish $15.99. Corona Light on draft which is a +."}
{"text":"First, Yelp is showing they are closed on Sunday and we just went there, on Sunday, so call ahead. 
We had a party of 3; we ordered a strawberry mojito-which was great, a cucumber margarita-which, while pricey, was excellent and strong, flautas appetizer, chicken enchiladas with mole, a chicken poblano burrito, and a chicken and homemade chorizo dish. Drinks were great. Flautas were good. The mole was on par with another top modern Mexican restaurant on the near West side. The homemade chorizo and chicken was the bomb, the burrito was crazy massive-like 12\" long, their refried beans were seriously the best I've had (compared to anything I've eaten in CA. or Texas.) Their salsa was excellent, slight cilantro flavor, slight heat, fresh and perfect consistency- not too chunky. Definitely going back to work through the menu. Their prices on on par with other modern Mexican restaurants in Cleveland, their specials are a bit higher in price but that's normal for just about all restaurants, and the only negative I can think of might be that their burrito dinner didn't come with any sides like the other dinners."}
{"text":"I feel like this a decent place to eat with opportunity for growth. 
They give you chips and salsa while you wait. The menu, though small, includes a lot of typical entrees you would find at a Mexican restaurant. 
Food portion sizes were good. They had a lot of choices for drinks if you're ordering alcohol. But, the drinks were almost all pretty pricey so you would think they would actually put some alcohol in them. I ordered the peach Mojito which tasted amazing but had nothing in it. My husband had the same to day of his Guava margarita. The staff was great. They all worked as a team so anyone walking by would offer to help or refill something. 
The negatives are: pretty pricey for a Mexican restaurant. 
My food was average but under-seasoned. 
I may go back to try happy hour but that's about it."}
{"text":"The presentation is beautiful. Food is all visually appealing and tastes as great as it looks. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help you order from the unique menu. A gem of a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good. Waiter was very attentive and kitchen was very quick to get appetizers and dishes to our table. Bar selection was very good.  
Food was ok. Not our favorite place but if you in that area and hungry save place to grab some food"}
{"text":"Great Place with great great food!!!  The best Chile rellenos ever!  Very good hand made drinks too!!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in town and so it was packed for a week night as the town is starving for new and good dining options. 

So it's a casual Mexican restaurant and it has a relatively big bar for a medium sized place. Nothing exciting but it works. We were seated and served right away despite how busy the place was. Salsa and chips came pretty fast right after drink order. So overall, services were good and quick.

Now the food...I have been to Mexico many times and so my tastes are a bit more particular. We ordered chicken tacos, beef enchiladas, and beef fajitas. The fajitas was a big portion but the beef was overcooked and on the dry side. The rest of the dishes were good. So because of the big portions and good service and nice atmosphere, I would be back. I just hope they would offer more authentic Mexican food from Mexico city area."}
{"text":"Abysmal service. They will be out of business within months. Too bad, because the food was pretty good the last time I was here. We walked out the last time though. Manager was on the phone while I sat at the bar for 10 minutes. Bartender made one drink for my girl and then left me twisting in the Wind while he took care of three other tables on the floor. Even though there was a waitress on the floor. Untrained, unprofessional oh, and they will never make it. Good riddance"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Mexican food! Friendly servers, authentic dishes, and chips and salsa always come out hot! I hope it sticks around, everyone needs to come check it out!"}
{"text":"Solid new Mexican Offering on the East Side

If you live in the Greater East Side, there's not too many fancy Mexican joints to check out.  Lopez for high end in Cleveland Heights, La Fiesta in Richmond Heights for classic family-vibe Mexican, and Don Ramon's for classic 'chain style' which is pretty solid and affordable.  

Mojitos is a new player with Mexi-Locally inspired cuisine that strives to be 'different' and entice customers with their twists on Mexican classics.  Their different styles of Gauc is a huge plus, we really enjoyed their fajitas as well which had different seasoning styles than your average Fajitas elsewhere.  I had the Peruvian Ceviche, which is essentially cod and it was pretty good but not amazing.  The free Salsa was a nice touch but nothing spectacular.  They are bran new, but the service when we went was top notch.  Free refills / quick attention and fast turn around.  Decent vibe inside but missing a special 'oomph'.  The patio will be great and I'm sure their 'feel' will improve when the liquor license comes through.  Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! If you are looking for authentic Mexican food with a modern twist, then this is the place. Probably the best Mexican I have had on the east s of Cleveland. Don't miss out on their long drink menu - you can get many varieties of Mojitos and Margaritas. We enjoyed the poblano pepper guacamole, the enchilada verdes, & a (super) spicy shrimp dish. All were delicious and worth the trek to the east side! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Pretty good start for a fusion type of Mexican food. Margaritas are good. Had the Ceviche which was a little over the top with sourness.  Chips and salsa are good."}
{"text":"This was a tough one to review - how to do you rate a Mexican restaurant with:  drinks...below average and leaning more towards unacceptable, BUT, with food that is authentic and overall very good.  

A family owned restaurant, Mojitos Modern Mexican, is the next entrepreneur to take on the challenge of the keeping a sustainable and profitable restaurant on the corner of Highland and Bishop. It is good to see another diverse restaurant option here in suburbia after Harry Buffalo moved down the road.  

Starting with the drinks.  The two things you order at a Mexican restaurant are cerveza or a margarita - I chose the latter as I was in a celebratory mood.  Charging 10 dollars for the standard margarita with an up charge for a more premium tequila (up to 15 dollars for the specialty flavors) - I was expecting quality - homemade and good flavor.  Instead, I was given a premix margarita where you could barely taste the alcohol and which reminded me of the bottles of Jose Cuervo premix bottles you can buy at the local gas station.  We also ordered a caipirinha - if i would have tasted that in a blind tasting, that is the last drink I would have guessed.  The bar staff needs to seriously take a look at the drinks recipes -- these are easy issues to address -- either lower the price point of the drinks otherwise, amp up the quality.  Note that when I did complain about my margarita, the restaurant immediately replaced my drink with no questions - this was appreciated.  

Food on the other hand - was on point and a pleasant surprise after our experiences with the drink orders.  The restauranteurs definitely wanted to change up the traditional Mexican restaurant with some local homemade fare.  

The Peruano ceviche was authentic and reminded me of our times in Peru.  It's huge.  Probably a good appetizer share for 4 people.  It's perfect to eat with chips and salsa.  

If you love spicy and shrimp, the camarones de diablo are excellent.  Spicy sauce with well prepared shrimp to layer on top of white rice.  Will definitely order this dish next time around.

The tacos are also well done.  Appreciated that the restaurant is flexible with mixing up the combinations of taco fillers.  By far the favorite has to be the Baja fish taco, however, the chicken and steak were also very well prepared.

All in all, this restaurant has great potential.  They have the food spot on, and that is the hard part.  Drinks can easily be addressed - I wanted to given another star, however, I just cannot bring myself to do that for a Mexican restaurant that has not nailed the margarita yet.   I do really really want this place to succeed.

Give this place a shot, try out the non-traditional dishes, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for some appetizers and cocktails. My sister and I sat at the bar and were quickly attended to. My sister had the jalapeño margarita (probably had a whole sliced jalapeño in it: bonus!) and I had a caipirinha.  I've had my fair share of caipirinhas and this one was probably the best I've ever had! (Oh, Batuqui, I still love you though!) Complimentary chips and salsa were good, nothing special, but much appreciated. The guacamole was fine, wish it had had a little more kick with red onion and cilantro. We shared the shrimp ceviche appetizer and that stuff is money!!!! I would go back just for that!!!!!  I think I had dreams about it last night...  Everything was reasonably priced. Will definitely return for dinner and hope everyone gives this place a chance because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Wish this place was better.. Have been there twice and same result.. On Cinco de Mayo it was packed and food was just ok at best.. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was so busy and new.. The Guac was good both times however.. There table Salsa both times its like a Tomato Purre sauce..Not much flavor so its so so at best.. My wife got the Burrito which had a red sauce on it.. That tasted more like paprika sauce than anything mexican.. My tacos i could not get A la carte so had the steak.. They were also so so... On Cinco De Mayo i got the Fajitas and they were pretty good.. But overall the need to step it up.. With how small the menu is, I figured it would be much better..."}
{"text":"We tried this new Mexican restaurant in search of tasty Mexican food. Mojito's didn't disappoint us. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and our server gladly accommodated my request for a cheese enchilada with suiza which isn't on the menu. She said the cook is wonderful and will be happy to make them.  My dining companion had a chicken dish and ate every bite declaring it delicious. 
While the menu is rather limited, Mojitos calls itself modern Mexican, and this place certainly isn't like a Chi Chi's! But the food is fresh and delicious, and worth the drive for a visit. In warm weather they have a roll-up door leading to nice outdoor seating. 
There is a large drinks menu which offers a tequila flight - hoping to try that next time"}
{"text":"Well its fairly new so they do NOT have their liquor license yet.
There menu were printed on plain paper and not very clear and yet very limited. The workers were very nice, and  kind so that was a plus,. the atmosphere is the same as before when it was harry buffalo so nothing new there . Chips were little greasy, salsa was pretty good. the guacamole has ok, if you like lots of lime and not so creamy. Food was overall pretty good .

changes they should make since they just opened.
1) Get better menus
2) Change the chips
3) Tell people there plates are very hot, they cam to table so hot I almost  burnt my hand.
4) Get your liquor license ASAP.
5) Get rid of the RAP music playing in the Mexican restaurant
6) watch your prices cause no body likes to pay a lot for Mexican.. NO one.

Good luck..."}
{"text":"We have been to this place four or five times since it opened in the Spring.  It's still good!  The food is really good, more than you can generally finish, and the service is friendly.  And now the patio is open!"}
