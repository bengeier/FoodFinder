{"text":"A friend recommended this place so I figured I would give it a try. We had no menu to go off of and just ordered a pizza and breadsticks. (Wish they had an online menu.) Fast delivery, decent prices and good food, dough is a little bland but the sauce makes up for it. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great! So are their prices. I really like their salads, sandwiches and burgers. Definitely one of my favorite pizza places."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up pizza and wings combo.  Pizza was good so were the wings and fries. All nice and hot.  There are coupons online and combo options too check out before you order it's helpful."}
{"text":"Got a flyer on our front door weeks ago and decided to just go for it. Read the reviews and I do think they're unfair. The pizza had nice crispy crust and flavorful cheese. Hawaiian special was yummy. Not very greasy at all but I was expecting a lot from the other reviews. Chicken fingers were alright, nothing special. But the Pizza hit the spot and all pizzas are 2 for 1. If you're iffy about it just give them a shot. Will order again. :)"}
{"text":"Received a flyer on the door of our hotel room last night and decided to take a chance. We had dinner salads that were huge and delicious and the supreme pizza incredible!  I usually don't like leftover pizza, but decided to try this one tonight, hot or cold is still very good.  I will order from them again for sure!"}
{"text":"Rude!! Called this place and some man answered the phone-couldn't understand what he said and asked if it was Roma Pizza. He said yes. I stated that I found them on yelp and asked if they had specials and he couldn't understand what I was asking so I repeated myself. His response was well what do you want, I can't read the menu over the phone. I thanked him and hung up!"}
{"text":"Meet up with a few buddies at the PT's Pub a few establishments down. The PTs didnt offer food and i was starvin so when i asked for a menu the bartender gave me the menu to Roma Pizza. I figure i'd just walk there and put the order in myself.

Took advantage of their 3x extra large one topping pizza combo, had an urge for wings and fries so threw on the wings and fries combo as well. Paid somewhere around 30 dollars so it wasnt too bad.

Pizzas came out around 15-20 min later and wow...For as much grease as each slice contained there was just ZERO flavor from ANYTHING.

The cheese was the greasiest cheese i've ever had and tasted neither like cheese nor pizza.

The ham had slices of ham so thin they were nearly tasteless and contained the same amount of grease as the standard cheese.

The pepperoni suffered the same fate as the last two. Having too thin and small slices of pepperoni which barely registered a taste and had a fine shiny layer of grease on top. 

The wings could have been tossed better for some pieces were evenly coated, others where just half on half off.

The fries werent bad. I was surprised at the fries being not bad. I half expected them to be deep fried gummy bears filled with grease."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Definitely need more credit for their amazing customer service and food!"}
{"text":"Stupid Idiots left a flyer on my door, but after ordering called back 10 minutes later and said it was to far to drive. WTF"}
{"text":"got a small calzone (pepporoni&cheese) it was bomb and a great portion enough maybe for 2 and some fries that were perfect as well everything affordable and delicious !!! The perfect Munchies"}
{"text":"Love this little local spot, especially when I'm hitting happy hour at PT's next door. Great deals on chicken fingers and wings that are always delicious. Pizza is solid and they always have good specials. I like the chicken parmesan sandwich as well as the buffalo chicken fries. Good, fast, cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing (well ok, it took me me 3 days, but I ate it all). Think I'll order another one tonight."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, very tasty crust and high quality toppings. Affordable and quick they are all you could ask for in pizza delivery. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered Philly cheesesteak sandwiches with fries and 2 different pizza pies . The gentleman there were so polite and very welcoming.  It was my first time there and i shall be going again . Thank u guys you rock!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that for what it was, the pizza was actually not too bad.  A little on the greasy side, but not so bad that I have to take breaks eating due to an imminent arterial embolism.  The crust was nice (I know everyone likes a nice, soft crust) and the ingredients weren't super fresh, but I didn't expect it to because of the accommodating price.  Speaking of price, prices are decent and the people there are friendly.  I think we went with the 2 large topping special and, although I don't remember the price, the total came out to be cheaper than any of the other pizza shops in the area.  ANDDDD I wasn't upsold when I got there to pick up my pizza, which is nice because everytime I do anywhere to get pizza, I always seem to get stuck with a pizza guy/girl who insists that I try their AWESOME breadsticks.  Pleasant surprise.

Not bad...will try to venture out to the breadsticks next time and see what it's all about but, for the price, I'm sure I'll be stopping by if I'm working and need my pizza fix."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint ever! Friendly staff, great food and best price in town! We always order the pizza, wings and finger deal for my family of 4. Plenty of food. Went in today for a pickup special without ordering ahead, \"ready in 10 minutes\" he said, sure enough a perfect  in 10min. Thanks Roma for being great!"}
{"text":"I love this place I love their specials and of course the pizza I prefer their sausage and pepperoni pizza and It was delicious and I love their wings and fries!!!!!!!! Will come back again thank you guys you are amazing!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered a meat calzone and ten wings from this place. The calzone was good, but the wings sucked. The food was cold by the time it was delivered. It was disappointing. I probably won't get food from here again."}
{"text":"Roma Pizza is an old school pizzeria. It's pizza is consistent, affordable and good. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. They will prepare whatever you ask for. They do not chisel customers who ask for slight variations on the specials. They are fast as lightning. On multiple occasions when I wanted to run an errand while they were preparing the pizza I intentionally told them to hold off for a few minutes. They take great pride in banging the pizzas out for whatever reason. It's like a competition to them

Not to be confused with Roma's - which apparently is terrible. Give Roma Pizza a try and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Roma pizza on Tropicana, formerly known as Tropicana Pizza, is one of my favorites. I usually go for the carry out deal but I've had them deliver a few times as well. They are open until 2am, catering to the PTs a couple doors down. The owner is incredibly nice, I have not one bad thing to say about him. You can tell he works hard because he's always there. Always answering the phones, making the pizzas, handling the register. The quality is great. I've only once had one given to me that was slightly undercooked but time and time again it's made to perfection. They also have pastas and subs, fingers and wings. The usual for a great pizza shop."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and chicken wings! The best part? Honesty! 
We called to place a delivery order: two medium pizza, bucket of chicken wings and drink.
The guy on the phone told us they were running specials: 2 large pizza + wings + drink for $32ish. Basically he gave us free upgrade on pizza and discount on drink. 
The pizza was delivered faster than their estimated time. 
Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza at Roma, and the staff there are very nice to, and there prices are the best in town, I've been to pick up at there location to and saw that it was very clean , definitely am going to go at Roma's for pizza"}
{"text":"Really cool, small, friendly restaurant with amazing pizza. The crust was my favorite part. And the \"Chicken wings\" was delicious with my pizza. This is the perfect place to come for outstanding pizza at extremely reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place on a Friday night. Delivery times are usually reasonable. The pizza is greasy and delicious. We've tried their salads and cheese steaks, they are good. And their wings are the best. Nice local spot for good pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place. My fianc√© started working at the tattoo shop next door a few weeks ago so we have ordered from them a few times. Their pizzas are really tasty and the crust is nice and crispy. Their wings are really good too, although they can be a little greasy. I liked their pizzas so much that I ordered from them today for a lunch my office provides for seniors today. Everyone, including our staff, loved the pizza! Our clients said it's the best pizza they've had at our center. The guys who run the place are always very nice and helpful, even if they aren't overly friendly. When I called to place the order, I asked what time they open and the answer was \"we can open whenever you need us to.\" I was pretty impressed by that. 
I definitely recommend trying these guys out."}
{"text":"I love the gyro with feta cheese the best ever land the best thing is that my delivery is always small cause it's just me and the deliver with no problems or making me by extra food to be delivered love it thank you"}
{"text":"Bomb pizza! Cheap, fast, easy! Unfortunately PTs pub next door is gone, but the food is still good!"}
{"text":"Been a costumer for years, they take pride on their pizza and their consumers. One of the best independent pizzerias in Vegas. But the only good thing good is the pizza. Cheese sticks are not bad, mozzarella chesses sticks got me sick once, chicken and French fries are ok, nothing special. But like I said the pizza is really good."}
{"text":"good pizza , i like the meat lovers , i also like the burgers they make and recommend the carry out specials are great. check them out if u have munchies and want fast hot pizza late night as well"}
{"text":"Delivery took about an hour or so but it is a busy weekend. The pepperoni pizza was very greasy and hardly any sauce. Also we got cheesy breadsticks (they were out of mozzarella sticks) those were greasy and the dipping sauce, which I think was supposed to be marinara, reminded me of watered down Tostitos salsa."}
{"text":"Very quick delivery, however the pizza crust was to soft alike it was not cooked all the way. The wings were meaty and their mild sauce is good. I just wish their pizza was better."}
