{"text":"Firstly, this was my first visit. 

Just to reiterate.....service is well below par. With that being said the food is meh. It is neither good nor bad. My boyfriend and I were hungry so we tried one of the combo platters made for two. It had steak (salty, chewy, and overcooked), chicken (seasoning was minimal and it also was overcooked) and lastly pork (this was the best meat on the plate). It also included white rice which was ok and some plantains. I ordered the empanadas....one beef and one chicken. This was the highlight of the meal. Beef was better but I did enjoy both. Lastly, you are supposed to get bread with the meal....like many restaurants it comes before your meal. I asked once we received the main course and our waitress said that they were out. Probably something you disclose at the beginning of the meal. Well come to find out, they were not out. I'm sure she noticed my unhappiness with this news and came out a minute latter saying that they would have it right out. So basically she lied.....not sure how you go from being out to all of a sudden having some stashed in the back??? 

Needless to say probably won't be coming back. If anything....I would order the $2 empanadas and call it a night."}
{"text":"We walked in without a reservation, we were told they did not have any tables available but we were welcome to sit at the bar. We did, the bartender was great. The food was fantastic. We live in TN and we are trying to think of reasons to go back to Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is sad. We liked the upbeat live Cuban band music. People were dancing up a storm and having a great time to the beat. The decor is attractive and the food, while not spectacular, is good. However, they water the mixed drinks at A Piece of Havana, an action so fundamentally dishonest that my partner and I will never go there again. I ordered a Mojito with Bacardi Superior rum. It contained zero rum--water, ice, and mint for flavor. When I sent it back they took it off the bill but without a word of apology. For me this is a deal breaker. For you, well, caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have yet to write a review well here it is... the food is delicious and the sangria superb... Enjoyed dinner tonight and each and every time I go here I enjoy the food, drinks and cozy atmosphere...oh I almost forgot on Saturday nights the live music is really nice."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but not completely authentic- and the quality seems to be a little hit or miss. Sometimes we'd go and everything would be fine, other times the rice would be bad or something else not made right, over-seasoned, under-seasoned, etc.

If you're looking for authentic Cuban food, you're much better off making the drive out to Rock Hill and hitting the Carlos Cafe."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in one day since I've always wanted to try the place and pass it all the time on the way to Club Fitness. We ordered some sangria and Havana Sampler to start. The sangria, turnover and plantains were delicious. The fried pork chunks, meat balls, and fried yuca were very bland and overcooked/dry. We also got the roasted chicken which is supposedly a house specialty. The portion was huge but the sides and chicken itself were again bland and overcooked. 

OVerall, this would have gotten the place at least a \"meh\" and two stars. However, the service was absolutely terrible. I never like it when servers interrupt you during a meal and ask how it's going while you're still chewing on a large forkfull but at Piece of Havana I had to get up and ask for an extra silverware despite trying to flag down a waiter making his rounds. I then had to wait abnormal lengths of time to get a water refill. At that time I also requested a sangria refill but by the time it came out we were already done with our meal! I then had to get up again and go to the hostess station to ask for my check! Very inattentive service led us to not even order the tres leches dessert which I've heard is fantastic. This is too bad since I won't be back."}
{"text":"Randomly drove by and I don't drive by a Cuban restaurant without trying it. Ambiance was good and service was quick. I ordered the pork with rice and black beans, it was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but, worth having again. Mojito was pretty good too. With two drinks and two entrees, meal came out to 35$... Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Disgrace that they would even serve croquetas like this. And to top it off they aren't even filled it's almost as if injected. I would say save your money for a flight to get some real Cuban food in south Florida."}
{"text":"LOVED!!  I went recently with a group and loved everything I ordered.  We had the empanada and croquette appetizer.  So good.  Came with 4 (3 different) delicious empanadas...ham, chicken, and beef.  The avocado dip was perfect and came with plantain chips that I could have eaten by itself.

Split the shredded beef and Milanese chicken entrees.  Both very good...I couldn't decide which one I like better.  Side of sweet plantains and yellow rice were both delicious.  We all agreed the yellow rice was better than the congri.

Had tres leches cake for dessert and was perfect.  I am a chocolate lover and preferred this cake over the chocolate crepes that we also ordered.

Only complaint was one person had the pork and it was a little overcooked.  Overall great food and live music was a plus.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Try the chicken and fried beef, this place is your traditional Cuban joint and one of the few that is really good in this area. Be prepared to wait a little while, but that is usually standard at most authentic Cuban places. You will not leave hungry.  They have a live band on weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent Cuban restaurant and with very reasonable prices.  I have never had a bad meal here and love their crispy shredded beef, but I had the mojo pork the other day and it was great as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! The palamillo steak, roasted pork, black beans, and plantains were amazing. One of the best mojitos I've ever had. There was a large celebration that took up half the restaurant and the food and service was still excellent. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The first thing that impressed me was the daily specials. In my opinion, that is never a bad idea, especially on drinks. They had a decent bar selection and their mojito came highly recommended. I love Cuban sandwiches, so I couldn't wait to try the \"Milanese\", a breaded beef steak or chicken breast, with lettuce, tomatoes, ham and cheese in Cuban bread. They use American cheese in the sandwich and when I tried to order it with Swiss or Jack (my twist) the server looked confused and slightly hesitated, so I just let it ride with the American cheese as-is. My friend ordered the homemade chips and guacamole and it was really good. My sandwich was good, it came with a side and they featured a good bottled beer special that night. We also got a mojito and it was actually as good as word of mouth. The Menu appetizers include Papa Rellena (Stuffed Potato with ground beef), Empanadas and Tostones Rellenos de Camarones. Entrees include such specialties as Arroz con Pollo, Bistec de Palomilla, the very popular Paella from Spain (a seafood mix with Saffron yellow seasoned rice cooked with beer) and ropa vieja (Shredded Beef) a traditional Cuban dish. They have a decent selection of wines, Latin-American cocktails, domestic and imported beers as well as their famous Mojitos. They also have Cuban style sangrias by the glass and by the pitcher. 

The design of the dining room is a re-creation of the early 1900's in Havana, Cuba. Although it's not as authentic as it could be, It does create a warm and cozy feel. The chandeliers make the room sort of dimly lit and romantic. There is a lot of Cuban art on the walls and they play Cuban music for background ambiance through the week, with live music and DJ's on the weekends. This seems like the type of place my man Ernie Hemingway would have visited in La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana to get loaded on Mojitos and Daiquiris, then fall into a hammock and scrimshaw a few classics. Ah yes, Big Ern was a wild boy. No doubt. A Piece of Havana features live music every Friday & Saturday from 7PM to 10PM. Fridays are \"Havana Nights\" with a DJ spinning International music. If you're not too familiar with Cuban cuisine, start with sandwiches and salads and work your way up the menu."}
{"text":"This place is doing Cuban food right. I've been here several times and will continue to come for as long as they're open. Staff and servers have always been friendly and I've never experienced any long delays. Food has always been exceptional in presentation and taste. For those who aren't sure of what to order for the first time. I recommend going with the ropa veja and crocettas as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The oxtails will keep you addicted, as will the guacamole! So many good things, just pick something and enjoy!

Service is terrible, even for a simple call in and pick up, Especially if you don't speak Spanish.

They used to have dancing to spanish language music on the weekends.  If they still do, it's a great time with no fighting or negative issues of any kind."}
{"text":"The food was good. Mojitos were average. Cool ambience. Friendly service. ... But for a party of 2 I feel that we waited too long on a day that Wasn't busy for our drink then food order to be taken. 

Lots of personalized decor adds a nice touch to the feel of the restaurant. 


I can still confidently recommend,but I worry about the speed of service on a busy night. 

I had the shredded crispy beef.  .  Pretty good !"}
{"text":"If your wanting to hear live cuban music, And taste it too you have to come to come to POH!! and don't forget to try a mojito or yummy sangria YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to have great experience here. Came with my husband for a date night with a reservation. We were 10 min early and seated right away. But experienced long wait time just see a waitress and order drinks. The food was was ok but what really upset us is that after we got our food we did not see a waitress until we had to ask for to give us our checks! This was a hour wait. This was very frustrating being that it's a nice place with live music. I hope they get this together."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best mojitos in Charlotte!!!  This is the first restaurant that I've been to in this city that puts fresh fruit in their mojitos, I recommend the strawberry and mango ones.

The decor and overall atmosphere is really enjoyable, we went on a Friday night when they had live Cuban music.  We were also told that later that night, they'd open up the dance floor for salsa night.

The service was very prompt initially, actually too prompt.  I've always had a pet peeve around being given my entree less than 5 minutes after you brought my salad out.  Other than that one slip up, the rest of the service that night was excellent.

The food was very fresh and tasty.  I had the calamari, chicken Caesar salad and the Havana Pork.  The calamari was very fresh and had a nice tangy dipping sauce on the side.  I only had a couple bites of the chicken Caesar before my Havana Pork came out, so I can't really comment on the salad since I just had them trash that.  The Havana pork was nicely seasoned and extremely tender.  Based on the way the pork was cooked, I'd recommend their pork dishes to anyone.

Pricing is very reasonable, most entrees run between $7-16.  If you're looking for good Cuban food, A Piece of Havana is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Catered lunch from here today. OMG! So good (this coming from someone that lived in S. Florida for 5 yrs so I know good cuban food) We ordered Lechon, Picadillo, Sweet Plantains, Black Beans & Rice, and green beans."}
{"text":"Went on 8/25/13 during a short visit to Charlotte. Appetizer was excellent -- croquetas and empanadas. The main courses were good, but not necessarily the Cuban taste that I grew up with. Service was good, ambiance is nice, bar looked very well stocked."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and tasty. BUT, the music last night was so loud that it diminished the enjoyment of an otherwise delicious meal. We told the waitress, who was lovely, but nothing changed. I will not go back because of it. Too bad,,,,"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, my group decided on Cuban food for dinner.  I am so glad we chose A Piece of Havana.  The entire experience was amazing!  Service was great.  Food was SPECTACULAR (huge portions)!  The vibe is really cool.  We went on a Friday night and they had a group performing. There is a small dance floor where patrons could salsa and mambo.  It was so much fun!  If you're nearby, be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is super friendly and the food is fabulous. I always get the roast pork with the Congris (Black beans and rice) and a bowl of soup on the side. Everything is made from scratch and is always hot and delicious. The roast pork is so tender and the mojo sauce they do it with is incredible. Sweet, tangy and delish. I always walk out full for 9 bucks. And that's with a tip. They even have a card now so that after you buy 6 lunches you get one free. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"The worst servers ever! It's a good thing that the food is good. I sat outside  and got no service what so ever. I had to go in to order, get my check and pay! They tend to forget the tables outside.  There is nothing worst to me than bad service. Service completes your overall dining experience. What a shame!!"}
{"text":"I had mouth already to eat some cuban food.  Then instead I got served really bad greasy Mexican food.  Yuck couldn't even eat half of it.  Charlotte is in such desperate need of a good cuban restaurant! At least I can get a decent Cuban sandwich from Publix."}
{"text":"It seems like a lot of people reviewing this place as not being too great aren't very familiar with Cuban food to begin with. If you are familiar with it and enjoy it, you'll like this place. 

I'm native to the Tampa Bay area of Florida so I'm quite familiar with the cuisine. The food here is excellent and seasoned well, the atmosphere is quite beautiful and the staff is personable. I had the Palomilla Sirloin Steak and it was delicious. Their homemade tres leches cake is also intensely delicious (extremely moist yet not mushy), and their Cuban shakes are very good too."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y la comida riquísima  recomendable la comida salió rápido muy atentos a todo los postres muy ricos me hizo el día este restaurant"}
{"text":"Muy buena comida,excelente musica en vivo,clases de baile y ambiente latino ideal para un viernes en la noche"}
{"text":"Between the crispy shredded beef, chicken havan, and skirt steak you can not go wrong with this place.  Everyone there is very nice and the mojitos are delicious!"}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant a  big 0. They  don't have any respect for the costumers. I don't care is the food is acceptable, but the service at this place is really poor. Mangement does not know how to deal with the costumers. My phone was stolen at this location at nothing was done about it. Unfortunately was an Apple 4 that cost $600. I will not recommend a place."}
{"text":"No offense nor disrespect but I'm a Latino that's cultured around Cuban cuisines from living up North, this is the second time in 2 years that we were disappointed.  Never again!  Don't recommend, truth!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows Cuban food can tell the difference. The taste of the beans taste like Mexican beans. The pork chucks  ordered were saturated in oil. Any Cuban knows that pork is supposed to be accompanied with limes, which at this restaurant they do not even offered with the food, the rice was extremely dry. I am sorry, but for real Cuban food please don't waste your time. Go to Miami one day, and taste the real Cuban food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We found it on our honeymoon in 2012, and came back recently. The food was just as good and the service was excellent. The Cuban coffee is wonderful."}
{"text":"Just like the name, it give you a taste of Havana. Food is good and cater to American taste. The atmosphere is friendly, service is good. A good place for lunch."}
{"text":"I went to eat here for the first time on a Saturday night when they have the live music. On my visit, there were two men singing along with some kind of music machine with various tracks on it.  I only mention it because there werent live musical instruments being played, but it was okay because whatever sound system they have makes the music sound like it is live in the building.  They were great singers and even stepped out and danced at times with the customers who gathered at the front to dance.    

I ordered the stewed beef with rice. It was very good. I also tried the strawberry mojito.  Im not typically a drinker, but it was very strong (to me). I don't know if that's good or bad.  Otherwise our server was nice and a couple different people stopped by our table to check if we needed anything. 

Also, we had a reservation and were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  And good music to boot!  Get the empinadas, yucca, plantains, and tropical beef."}
{"text":"My wife decided to try this restaurant the other night as we are avid foodies and love trying different cuisines. We have been to other Cuban restaurants before but not with the same atmosphere and flair as Taste of Havana. After a tasty Mojito, we started out with the calamari appetizer. It was very tender and seasoned well. We both agreed the sauce was so good, you almost wanted to eat it as a soup. For entrees. she had the fried pork chunks and I had the fried shredded beef. Both were equally delicious (we tried each other's entree).
For desert, we both had the tres leches and Cuban coffee. A perfect compliment. There was also a live band which added to the ambiance. I was very pleased with the check as well. Drinks, appetizer, entrees, desert and coffee all for around $60.00 bucks including tip. We will definitely be coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD! It's out in the middle of no where but well worth the drive. Everthing that we ordered was spot on.  I felt the dinner portions were small for the prices but the taste and quality of the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"We had a Cuban sandwich and a sampler platter. Sandwich was hard no mustard no mayonnaise no pickles.  sampler platter was very confusing. Could not tell what was what, All fried. Male Server was so not helpful. Very rude and curt.  Will not ever go back that is for sure."}
{"text":"NOT HAPPY. 

Service was awful.  Food came wrong. I was super disappointed.  Mojito was good though. 

Will never go back. Got the stank eye when I let them know I had issues."}
{"text":"My first trip here and I enjoyed it. Great restaurant and the food was amazing and authentic. Tuesday was half off wine by the glass which made my meal perfect. Friday's and Saturdays they have live music and the place is hopping. 

I gave 4/5 stars because the food was great but we were sitting at the bar and the service there was ok. Maybe the service would have been better if we had sat down at the table. But overall good experience."}
{"text":"Went for my b-day dinner, a little disappointed this time. They have changed the menu some, deleted some items. and this night they were out of couple of things all together. Good news they are opening a \"Tapas\" lounge right next door, so they will be connected. They also did some changes to the dining room - not sure if this will stay that way, but honestly wasn't overly impressed with the entire night.
We did order an app, they were out of ham croquettes, and they no longer serve calamari in the main dining room - they said they might in the Tapas lounge.
Service was good - server nice.
Want to go back for the Tapas lounge to try it out, the restaurant not sure we will eat in there anymore."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Great location. Family place. BUT service is hit and miss. Week day lunch took 90 minutes, and made me late for work. Coupons keep it inexpensive."}
{"text":"Good food!
Unfortunately...Without any disclosure they charge 24% to 21% tip included on the check.
Don't get me wrong service was good and I planned on giving a generous tip, but I'm not a fan of being tricked into tipping an amount that I did not approve of."}
{"text":"The food - my favorite dish, the red snapper is the best. 

My only problem is that it's difficult to get a table when you show up, yet you're told they don't take reservations. On several occasions we visited and was told there weren't any available tables because of the tables were reserved, yet there only a few people in the restaurant. I guess my question is, if you arrive at 6:30 and a table is reserved for 8:00, I don't understand why one can't be seated and served and out by the time the table is needed."}
{"text":"Finally made it here, and I must say DAYUM...so good! Roasted pork dish was awesome. I will be here more often"}
{"text":"Ok...Stop into this restaurant for lunch...My husband and I love cuban food and thought we would give it a try.  Surprisingly it was very delicious..  Service was quick and steaming hot.  However, we stop in today (Sunday evening) for dinner and service was not so good...

First, for a Sunday evening (6:30p) customers were few at hand. (maybe 8)..so we had hoped service would be quick and attentive...NOT!!  On the contrary, service was very slow...
Secondly..We waited at least 30 minutes to be served. (remember almost empty restaurant)
Thirdly, and most disappointing, was the food...Unlike the lunch service, the food was luke warm....Important ingredient (Mojo sauce) left out of recipe....Rice, cold...Plantains, burned.  Smh!!  Not acceptable....
If you plan on visiting this restaurant....Make sure it's LUNCH TIME!!  Because the food is really good..."}
{"text":"We had a party of 15 and everyone loved the food, from the crispy beef to the Cuban sandwich, from the Havana Chicken to the Cuban green beans and so much more everything was wonderful! The server was able to answer all of our questions and they took wonderful care of us. We all highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food was good; however, the issue came after dinner. Our check was $59 (with a $10 tip) but our waiter ran the debit card for $82. He could not figure out how to correct the error. The manager came to the table to explain what happened. She said that the amount we filled in would be all that would run through the debit card. She lied. We had a debit from the checking account for the $59 AND the $82. When we went back to speak to the manager. She said it was up to the debit company to correct. She refused to fix it even after we demanded cash back. She said it would be applied back to the account in a month. INSANE. We would not EVER eat here again. BEWARE."}
{"text":"So good and the staff is so sweet! Between 4 of us we got white rice, beans and rice, and yellow rice (all delicious), fried yuca, green beans, and yummy plantains for sides!   Roasted pork, Cuban skirt steak, crispy shredded beef, and Hemingway chicken! All so good! The owner ended up giving us a gift when we left because we asked questions and complimented the food! I definitely recommend this place! Great environment as well! Clean and inviting! Next time we are in town I want to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for!!  The shredded beef is by far the best dinner entree available on the menu! they have delights like the empanadas, croquettes and much more! it's even amazing for takeout. If you stay later in the night you will enjoy the lively salsa dancers!"}
{"text":"Was in town finding a new place to call home, and was missing my Spanish cuisine, found this place and I TOTALLY recommend it, the food was almost perfect, the service was spectacular, the place was clean and it felt good to get some authentic Cuban cuisine. If you want delicious Cuban food this place will give you your fix, and I'm from Miami I KNOW what good Cuban food is."}
{"text":"My husband and I came out to A Piece of Havana for dinner Saturday night. It was an A-Ok experience! Nothing bad at all but nothing spectacular. All in all, I am glad we stopped by.

We got here right around 7pm when the music was about to kick off. I was impressed because they had a decent size band playing live music!

I ordered a coconut mojito and my husband got a Dos Equis. The coconut mojito was very tasty and had shredded coconut on top. It wasn't very strong at all....not sure how much rum was in it! 

We decided to get the Havana sampler for a tizer and then split the shrimp in garlic sauce for the meal. The sampler was pretty good. However, most of the food was fried. Not really my style. I did like the plantains a lot though! The shrimp in garlic sauce was delicious though! That sauce was so yummy. For our sides we got black beans and green beans. Both were pretty decent and nice portion sizes! 

The band was awesome and definitely the highlight of the evening!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the birthday surprise. Our first visit!  Good food, great service (by Anita & other waitstaff) wonderful atmosphere with band & nice booth so we could still carry on a conversation. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Steele Creek and found this little place. Took my mother here for her birthday lunch, and I must say I was impressed! The food was delicious, great portions, and great prices! 
A waiter noticed my daughter was eating the leftovers of some of my cake and brought me a piece for her on the house!

I definitely recommend, and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food here, derive is top notch. I've been going here for 4 years. It's the best Cuban food in Charlotte hands down."}
{"text":"I'm cuban I love their food very authentic when my family comes over from Los angles I always take them to eat here lunch time specials are even better"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, friendly staff and AWESOME food!! Good to know u can find good places to eat around Carowinds besides fast food.

Had the skirt steak with green beans and fried yuca; everything was delicious!  Tres leches cake was sooooo good!! 
Service was excellent :)

I truly recommend this place, amazing food, and affordable prices."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a Cuban restaurant, but I loved A Piece of Havana.  

All of our food was absolutely delicious.  No complaints at all about the service either.  There were several large parties on the week night we were there and from what I could tell, there were only three staff members working the floor and still, our service was great.  The table beside us practically had the waiter explain the entire menu to them, plus the drink menu, and he was so patient and calm with them even though he clearly had his hands full.  I was very impressed.  

Is the food authentic?  I haven't a clue - but it was good and that's all I care about."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to southwest Charlotte and to A Piece of Havana. Growing up in Tampa, I have had the opportunity to eat at some authentic Cuban restaurants, but since moving to North Carolina, it has been difficult finding  Cuban food. For the most part, they fall short of my expectations.

Dora here. With so few Spanish restaurants in the Charlotte area, we were surprised to find the place empty. This is what it looked like on a Sunday around 11:30, but during our meal, people started rolling in. We just tend to be earlybirds.

For an appetizer, we chose the Caribbean Calamari, breaded, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. The calamari was plentiful, good, fried crispy, (maybe too crispy) and worked well with the dipping sauce. Dora here. Dry and brittle for me, but hubby cleaned the plate, so...

For my meal, I chose one of my favorite Cuban specialties, Fried Pork chunks slow cooked in Mojo sauce then deep fried and topped with sautéed onions. The pork chunks were great, fried perfectly and mixed well with the Mojo sauce and sautéed onions although more mojo sauce would have been great. The plantains (banana family) were firm, just as I remembered them, and the fried yuca was cut into larger pieces than I prefer.

Dora here. After living in Tampa for so long and loving Spanish food, I admit being a little disappointed upon first glimpse of the Palomilla Steak (Bistec de Palomilla). Pounded super thin and unbreaded, I could've done without the chimichurri sauce. I don't believe it added anything and actually detracted from the presentation. What do you think? 

Still Dora. Service was quick and the place was spotless. If we make it back (it's a long drive), I will order something different to avoid comparing A Piece of Havana with all our favorite haunts in Florida. The meal ended on a high note.

We rate this restaurant 3.5 forks out of 5 for a family restaurant serving very good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"I dont know i was just expecting something amazing when i was browsing through the photos and was a bit dissapointed. Food was decent."}
{"text":"I'm falling out of love with this place. 

Don't get me wrong--when it's good, it's really great. However....

My primary complaint is the lack of consistency, which I've heard from others also.  Each time we've come here, they're out of something--skirt steak, plantains, whatever. Sometimes they have closed before their posted closing time. Sometimes the bartender is not there during the dinner hour, which is sad, because I love their calle ocho mojitos.

I just never know what to expect.  I really hope they step up their game."}
{"text":"I live very close to here and decided to call in a carry out order. Ordered a Cuban sandwich which was very tasty, however I almost walked out before I got my food. It was about 630 and only about 10 people in the restaurant, I walked in and the hostess was at the front desk and gave me no attention whatsoever even when I was standing right at the desk. I remained about 10-15 minutes before the bartender finally asked me if I wanted a drink and I told him I was waiting for food, he gladly took care of me! Except for the bartender, the kind of service I received will not make me want to return any time soon. Hopefully they haven't lost too many potential customers due to this!

John B."}
{"text":"I just want to say this about the Restaurant...my family and I went in and there was maybe 4 people seated in the dining room and the bar was full..but plenty of open tables. We go in and say we need a table for 4...she looks at us and says we don't have any tables they are reserved. I was like really...she was like you can sit down but you have an hour to eat. What a joke...I was going to give it Another shot and call and do reservations..but they don't seem to be great with answering phones. So right off not a very good Impression of the place. Hopefully the owner fixes the reservation problem...Bc it's complete bull."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant I ever been, I went with my friends last week we were sitting at the bar trying to get a drink, no body even bother to ask us if we want some  drinks those bartenders were just looking down at never looked up we tried to get their attention but they didn't care so it took 30 minutes to get a drink, so I don't recommend that place is just  my friends and I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Best meal in steelcreeke! Always thinking about this place's mariquetas and Cuban coffee. If you can't stand the waits, come in on a Monday or Tuesday. Open table is also a pretty decent solution for you aren't spontaneous. There's always some type of event to look forward to in addition to the amazing food. Friday is salsa lessons!"}
{"text":"2nd time we have been there and customer service is an issue. We waited 20 minutes after being seated we left no waitress or water even offered."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and it was unfortunately a bad experience. I ordered the ropa vieja with white rice and sweet plantains and a side of tostones. The meat tasted plain, the white rice was definitely not fresh(refrigerated then microwaved) and the sweet plantains was cold as if it were just sitting there for many hours. The only part of the meal i could tell was just made were the tostones. Living in Miami for the most part of my life this was definitely not the quality Cuban food Ive known and grown up to love. 

The restaurant was clean and had nice setup. The service could of been better because my waitress surely seemed as if she didn't want to be there whats so ever. She barely attended my table and was more concerned speaking to her other coworkers about God knows what but it sure wasnt about taking care of her tables. She came to my table twice which was when i ordered the food and when i asked to pay for the meal. 

Maybe today was just an off bizarre day and hope that if I come back again I can have great reviews."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was slow and horrible. Mojitos were eh. Ox tails were very good. Service was entirely too slow for them not to be busy."}
{"text":"Terrible as a previous reviews.  I really recommend not go there. First I order a Piña Colada which didn't taste like one. Terrible mixed with pieces of coconut and pretty much sugar and cheap rum. The price was $8.00 dollars really expensive for the quality. For the main plate I ordered a Mofongo which is plate very recognized in the Caribbean.  This plate look like someone throw up on the plate. From the color to the taste it was nasty plus only 2 pieces of pork hard as concrete literally.  Frozen And tasteless yuca and a old salad on the side. If you don't want to lose your appetite please don't go there. Doing business like that I don't think the will be in business for too long. Simply nasty"}
{"text":"Skip the Paella, great atmosphere and drinks on a Friday night. Live band was great. Avocado dip was good but overpriced. Paella was wet, mushy rice with low quality imitation seafood, mixed in with shrimp, mussels, and a lobster tail on top. For $30, i expected better quality. The portion size was enormous, like family style with a serving spoon included. Picked out the shrimp and trashed the rest when i got home."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly servers, but SLOW and forgetful. It took over half an hour to get my check and another 10 to get it back, without my card. Definitely getting take-out next time."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place when the hubs was code orange, and the slow start (only one server for the whole restaurant on a Monday) left me nervous we were going to have to bail. However, once we were finally seated and our order was taken, the food was ultra fast. Our server asked if we were familiar with Cuban food, and well, I've never been there, so no. We ordered the roasted pork and grilled fish (mahi mahi). The roasted pork was good, the fish was OK but I'd order something different next time.  The plantains were (of course) delicioso, and I wished we had tried some of their really yummy looking mojitos (like 18 flavors) or sangria.  

But the whole point of this review is that FINALLY after waiting my whole life (OK so the 14 years I've been in the QC), I found worthy empanadas!! The server said the ham & cheese was his favorite but I went for the beef.  The pastry covering was nice and crispy, but not greasy at all and the beef was seasoned perfectly and also was not greasy at all!  Hallelujah!! Hail to the empanada maker!  Even though I live nowhere near Steele Creek/Ayrsley I would make an excuse to come back and have a meal of mojitos, empanadas, perhaps some of their avocado dip special and tres leches. Bueno!

Tip: coupon in Citipass made it even more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Never again!!! Last time we went there we had no reservation and they kicked us out practically saying that they were booked and they had no waiting.. uhm u close @2am and it was close to 8 ish maybe when we went.. So this time we went here on Saturday night @7:20. Pm We had reservations for 5. I walked in and the hostess told me that i had called in and canceled the reservation??? She personally remembers it cause she wrote it down. I assured her that neither i nor anyone else had called and canceled it. She went next door and found us seats. Place is really nice and they have music but the service yesterday was horrible.. got appetizers after 45 min of getting our drinks. The food came in probably 45+ min later. I had to chase the waitress to bring us more drinks and she only brought us 1 of the 3 drinks we ordered... she never came back withthe other 2 drinks. I never even bothered her again about them as we were getting ready to leave anyway. The. I had to chase her for the check and a box. 20 min later i had to ask another waitress for them as my baby started to cry now!! It was way past her bedtime ( we left there @10 pm)."}
{"text":"Food is ok. To start I was expecting Cuban bread not old sour bread. The mojo for the tostones no good. Service was nice looks clean. Pork chunks were dry. The sauce for the fried yuca was pretty good."}
{"text":"Warning.  I'm a highly opinionated half Cuban about my...errr....cuban food.   So unto A piece of Havana.  This is the first place (Out of Puerto Rico or Miami) that serves authentic Cuban food.    Want to know if you're in a real Cuban Restaurant?  Ask for a Materva.  If they don't have any, calmly proceed to the door.  Guess what, A  Piece of Havana keeps them ice cold.

Friday night is great here.  The Jazz band plays great Latin music, and creates a great ambiance.

The food:  My favorites are the Ropa Vieja, and the Parrillada Cubana will give you a a huge selection of food (steak, pork, and chicken), plus rice beans and sweet plantains.  

Next time I go there, I plan to order the Sea Food Paella.  It looked insane.  

I would eat here every week if it was closer to my house.

Have I said enough?  Go get your Cuban on!"}
{"text":"There are very few Cuban restaurants in Charlotte.  So, I give this one a four partially out of scarcity.

If you live in South Charlotte, definitely go.  It's a hearty, flavorful meal.

I don't know if I would make a trip out of it from huntersville, let's say, unless you just really want Cuban food.

In all, I thoroughly enjoyed it, however."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my meal. I ordered the pork platter and it was so bland, this is not authentic cuban food. Me and my husband spent $30 for horrible food what a waste our hard earned money. I will never go there back again"}
{"text":"Friday nights have live music, appears to start at 7pm, we (5 adults) arrived without a reservation at 6pm and were seated immediately but many others had reservations for 7 or later. Call ahead! 
Shared the fried plantain appetizer, DELICIOUS, and everyone liked their dishes- pork, chicken, pasta, shrimp. Friend with gluten allergies loves to eat here! She says it's never crowded at lunchtime. Green beans, fried yuca and sweet plantains are some of our favorite side options; haven't tried the sandwiches but willing to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for a week, and happened to pass by this place on a Friday night- the live music was intoxicating and my friend and I had to check it out. Food was good... atmosphere was great... and the musicians were playing passionately  add my 2 glasses of Tempranillo and it was beyond lovely. Only thing I wish was that they had more tables available. It was a bit strange to see all the tables in the center of the restaurant completely empty on a Friday night- and to have to leave earlier than we would have liked due to a reservation coming in. (We were still super grateful they sat us for the hour and a half we had there though.)  Really fun dinner experience, will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. 

Normally I love going here. I think they're food is excellent! I get the shrimp in garlic sauce with Cuban toast and green beans. The meal was swimming in garlic. Almost literally. I didn't finish because it was so garlicky. Pretty sure I am going to smell like garlic tomorrow. However, I do love some garlic, so this will not deter me from coming back. 

I also got the house made sangria. It is $3 on Monday which I think is a good deal. For all of you beer lovers a pint of Coors light is $2 everyday. Back to the sangria, it was ok. Vey sweet, but a good compliment to the meal. 

I thought our service was great. If I could just rate our waiter I would give him a 5 out of 5 stars. Very attentive and helpful with making our decisions."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and both times the service was lousy along with the food. I love Cuban food... The first time I ordered the whole fried fish and it was over cooked and tasted as though it had been cooked in old oil, my plantains were over cooked as well.  my girlfriend ordered some dish that contained shrimp that weren't  de-veined.. The only reason I gave it a second chance was because  she loves their mojito's.. This last time I ordered Pollo a la Habanera, rice and beans, and plantains. The chicken was over cooked and lacked any seasoning at all.  She ordered Ropa Vieja.  It did not taste or look like it has other places.  She pushed her plate to the edge of the table and our server (Manuel) asked what was wrong.  She proceeded to explain that it did not taste as expected. He responded that it was their signature dish, then proceeded to ask what was wrong with it in a harsh tone.  I interjected and stated that it was different from what she had before and maybe the recipes were different.. He snatched the plate away and did not return for 40 mins.  

The overall service was terrible.. We had to grab another member of the wait staff in order to get another drink, another member of the staff refilled her water, and I was never offered anymore tea by my server.  I kept my cool no need to get upset it wasn't worth it.. 

In conclusion.. I've had two bad experiences at this establishment and I love Cuban food.. I love food period. In order to get me to write a negative post you've really had to screw up..

The bright spot of the night was the entertainment though.. Loved the band.. They made the atmosphere very fun and pleasant.. 

 If you're ever in the DMV you should look up Cuba De Ayers.."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch, right before the holidays and again after.  Both times the service was a little spotty.  We would get seated right away but then it would take awhile for our order to be taken.  Once we ordered the food came out pretty quickly but then it would take awhile to get drink refills.  By the time we got refills we were ready for our checks which also took awhile to get.  Aside from that the food was pretty good.  I had the ropa vieja the first time which was good but didn't come with enough rice (at least for me, I like to have some rice for each bite and I ran out half way into my meal!)  I had to ask for more, which they had no problem just giving me some more.  The second time I went I tried the lechon asado which was also good.  This time I ordered the rice which had the black beans mixed in and that was a better helping than when I ordered the rice with the beans on the side...I'll definitely be back for lunch to try some of their other dishes but hopefully they can get their service a little faster.  They are very nice and helpful but just a little on the slow side!"}
{"text":"The live band can start at any time even though the website says after 10pm.  On the Saturday we went it started at 7pm.  

I personally hate loud music while I'm eating and they had a microphone on every instrument.  In a small space like their dining room you don't need to be that mic'd up.  I was deaf before we got our food and we couldn't carry a conversation with our friends.  

A good band knows how to adjust their volume for the venue.  They played a weird mix of Latin and US pop songs, and Bob Marley.  I wouldn't go back just for their band unless they lowered the volume and stuck to a theme in their music.  It's not a drunk wedding crowd they're playing for...

I got the Cuban sandwich (no cheese) with fries.  It was pretty tasty but I was burping pork the following 24 hours.  We went out afterwards and I definitely did not feel like dancing!  I would go back to try another dish but only if that's the only thing we're doing all night..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant...I read some great reviews on Yelp and knew I had to try this place. I was impressed with the service and the food was perfect. They also have live music and a nice little dance floor to get your salsa on. Great place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really tried to give this place a chance several times because I am of Cuban heritage and grew up to enjoy Cuban food. Each time I went with my mother who speaks fluent Spanish was great, but when I have gone by myself it was a whole different experience since I do not speak Spanish. 

The first time, the service was so bad. The hostess had an attitude with us and told us we had half an hour to eat. Our waitress came to our table only twice. We ended up having to speak with a manager and she gave us a $15 voucher for the next time we came in. 

So the next AND LAST time we came in we tried making a reservation for 8:30 and the man who picked up the phone kept telling us that they closed at 9. I told him we understood that but we were driving 2 and a half hours to eat at that particular restaurant. He then told us basically that by the time we got there we could not eat within 20 minutes. We got there anyway at 8:30 and were able to finish our meals by 9 no problem. Pretty sure the same man served our table. 

We ordered the croquette and empanada platter. When it finally came out we received 5 empanadas and no croquettes. We were only informed then that there were no croquettes and we got 1 extra empanada. This did not seem fair because we were still charged the $9 for an uneven number of empanadas when there were two of us and we were supposed to get a total of 4 empanada and 4 croquettes. He then asked us how many empanada we would rather have and if he should take the extra one away. He almost grabbed the 5th empanada with his hand. 

Our next peeve was that we specifically asked for the salted plantains instead of the sweet ones as our side and we got the sweet ones instead. He then told us that since we said plantain instead of tostone, we got the sweet ones. Right after that I saw him go up to another coworker with an attitude and point at our table. 

Overall we will not be returning again and will take our business somewhere else. Being open until 9 does not mean you stop serving half an hour before and that you have a limited time to eat. I have worked in the restaurant business and if you cannot wait for customers to finish eating after the time you close then you should not be working there. Being tipped is based on the quality of service that is deserved. It's very poor management and extremely rude. It is such a shame."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Great prices and fresh, delicious Cuban food. The crispy beef, tostanas, and congris are my favorite - but everything is pretty great.

Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the service is always very slow. The waiters are nice but it just takes forever to get orders in and pay. Would be nice to be able to get in and out in 30 mins but you'll need an hour here at least."}
{"text":"Ordered Mariquitas and got something that was not
Even close to what we ordered. And we questioned the waiter she said yes I know but this is what they did.  Service could not have been worse. Croquetas left a lot to be desired.  Enjoyed the live music but other than that will never be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a super-quick, super-affordable lunch and find yourself in this area, A Piece of Havana may be worth a try.  I ordered the roasted chicken with mixed rice/black beans and plantains.  I think the dish was $5.95 which is a great price.

However, I was a bit disappointed in the chicken - it was tasty but a rather small portion. Sadly, the mixed beans& rice was a bit dry and did not have a lot of flavor.  The plantains were good though.  

On the plus side, the service was very good and the food was delivered  super-quick. 

This place is not bad overall and if I happened to be in the area I would probably give them another try."}
{"text":"The food here was wonderful. My date and I had mojitos for drinks that were fresh and delicious. I ordered the chicken and he ordered the Cuban sandwich and we both shared the appetizers. the waitress provided great service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is not that great. Nothing that really makes me feel like I'd want to come back. Empanadas were good that's about it. If you want to have Cuban you can try it, I'm sure there's better places though."}
{"text":"FInally had a chance to check out this place. I'm a large proponent of Cuban cuisine and had put off trying this place for far too long. It's a trek from where we live in Dilworth, but I'd say it's damn worth it. Located off of South Tryon past Carowinds, It's in a small shopping center, but as it's own building. 

We stopped in on a Saturday night and we were greeted with live music. It was awesome. The guy was singing his heart out and I'm happy to say that he was really good. It wasn't unpleasant at all. Actually added to the ambiance.

We started out with the avocado dip (basically guac) with fried plantains. Dude. I'd highly recommend getting this. The dip is pretty commonplace with other guac varieties, but the fried plantains make for a really nice change-up from plain corn chips. We cleaned the plate between the three of us. 

I went with the Cuban sandwich. I have to order it any time it's offered at a Cuban place. Happy to report it's a textbook sandwich. Flaky Cuban bread, yellow mustard, Swiss, pork, ham, dill pickles. That's all you need. Ordered it with a side of tostones. Mashed, and fried plantains served with \"mojo.\" Basically an oily, garlic-y dipping sauce. It's amazing. Super mild and a nice touch.

We also ordered a couple of the gin mojitos. Have to give these a big \"meh.\" It's a great idea, but the grenadine really killed the flavors. It was just too heavy.

Service was incredibly friendly and cordial. The place was packed and the guys on the floor took care of everyone with a smile. 

Cuban dinner round #2: Coming very soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the oxtails with rice, beans, and plantains. By far, the best oxtails I've had. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was excellent. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and not drowned in salt. Croquetas are made fresh to order. The red bean soup was so delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit the first time I went here the service we had was a 2 star performance.  It would have been a 1 star if we didn't start asking other servers for things (turned out our original server couldn't care less).   Having said that, the food was what brought me back - never had fried yucca before!

The second visit was a complete 180!  Our server was super-attentive and kept the cups full and checked up on us consistently and always with a smile.  The food was again amazing - I could seriously eat their chimichurri sauce out of a bowl.  This time there was a live musician and the atmosphere was electric - people got up to dance in the front as well!  The coolest thing I noticed was that most of the tables were larger groups - which probably aided in the festive atmosphere.

You'd be a fool to not try their fried yucca and if you're really going for that food coma- definitely get the tres leches for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Was there Friday night for drinks. Atmosphere is great!!!  So was the music!!  Def a nice spot to go with friends or a date."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was around half capacity. Appetizer sampler platter was great and came out quick, but I agree with the other reviews that the service for entrees was a little on the slow side. Would not recommend coming here if you need a quick 30 minute in and out. 

I had the Ropa Vieja and it was pretty good, but a little salty. It comes default with white rice, black beans, and plaintains, but you can sub them for 2 sides of your choice. Papaya shake was great and recommended. I'd probably go back, but it won't be a staple favorite."}
{"text":"I consider myself Cuban by default... I was born and raised in Miami and just left two years ago. That said, I was so excited when discovering this home away from home! I have to admit I was skeptical at first but they had me at my first mojito! 

The food is muy rica (delicious) and very on point with what Cuban food is. We started with the mariquitas (thin slices of crispy plantains) and they transported me to calle Ocho in little Havana!  I ordered my favorite dish- vaca frita and it did not disappoint. We ended with flan and tres leches for dessert. Since then we have gone back several times and had great experiences. Never a bad dish.

They have live music on the weekend (first was a great salsa band.. Another time was just a Latin dude and his keyboard). 

Either way I am a fan and when I'm craving some good old Cuban cooking, that is where I head!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a colorful and festive environment. The crispy beef is amazing and their yuca (both fried and boiled) is the perfect side. An authentic and affordable meal with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I give the food a 4 star, but the service was pretty bad.  We had to remind the waiter 3 times to bring our drink and he told us the wrong information on a few of the dishes we ordered.  I will definitely go back, just with lower expectations on the service."}
{"text":"This is the first time eating here. It's a friends birthday dinner and everyone is pretty disappointed with their meals! The steaks were way over cooked. My side- green beans and fried Ukas taste freezer burned. Drinks and atmosphere is all this place has going for it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a warm, family-owned and family oriented restaurant, plus the food is always amazing! My fiancée and I usually share the paella dish, which has lots of seafood and flavorful saffron rice. You can't go wrong with the mojitos, especially the Calle Ocho! The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is vibrant. I'd definitely recommend it, wether you're just in the mood for lunch or dancing the night away, you'll have a great time at A Piece of Havana!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch. It's a good size restaurant with a nice little bar. Menu seems authentic with the little knowledge I have on Cuban food. But naturally I had to order the Cuban sandwich and the mariquitas with avocado. The sandwich was good but the mariquitas were the best I've had while warm."}
{"text":"My go to for Cuban food for lunch. I passed this place dozens of times before me and my fiancée finally decided to try it, and we were not disappointed! Their lunch prices are really low for the amount of food you get. But let's get into the important stuff, the food. I can only speak for the beef and chicken dishes but both are amazing! Flavorful and moist. You can't go wrong. For sides, I usually get the beans and rice and plantain and both are always made well. I have been several times and the food is always consistent and fresh. For $6 you can get a quality meal the same price as fast food. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"Got some coffee and plaintains to go while on a road trip. The coffee was great. Good flavor and hot. The plaintains were not good. I have had much better other places. Next time a road trip brings me this way, I will stop and try the full menu before I write their food off."}
{"text":"This is authentic Cuban! We were thrilled to find this place. The tastes took us right back to our childhood kitchen in Miami where our abuela cooked. 
The croquetas came out piping hot. The to stones were great. I had the masitas de puerco and they were great too. I asked for lime just because that was how we ate them growing up, with lots of lime. The boiled yuca was good, could have used a bit more mojo. My kids had a pan con bistec. It was the thin steak cooked just as it should, i am just not sure it was on real cuban bread. It comes with mayo and mustard so we opted to have it without. They ate it all though and really liked it. The Cuban coffee (espresso) was very authentic, the way they make it on calle ocho. We look forward to returning. So glad to find this place!"}
{"text":"Authentic cuban. Good sandwiches and pork dishes. Food should have been much hotter as it was room temp. Flavor was on point. Service was slow but friendly. Very rude hostess told us we couldn't stay ( there was about 8 or 9 empty tables too ) and that was super annoying as we spent a lot of money and even ordered food to take home. Live music was terrific."}
{"text":"Very good food! I lived in Miami for17 years and was spot on for variety of dishes, etc.
Finally found a good Latin restaurant in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Updating because return visits have proven to be a much better experience. Although, I have not tried another Cuban sandwich. I chose more traditional Cuban entrees and enjoy them very much."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again!!! My family and I have tried to come here...key word TRIED several times n they are always closed or just closed hours before the time indicated online. They claim they are a family owned business n when business is dead they close early so there for they need to indicate that online.... Needless to say that will be my 3rd n last time trying to eat at this family owned business... Good luck running business like that!"}
{"text":"Worst Cuban food I've have ever had. Beans had a funky taste (maybe burned). Ropa Vieja was dry, clumpy & so bad tasting I couldn't eat it (and I have never not eaten a meal at a restaurant before). Also, I ordered the smaller portions and brought/charged for the more expensive portions. Same situation with my wife who ordered the steak which had a good sauce on it but the steak itself was practically tasteless. My kids ordered Cuban Sandwiches & Miami Sandwiches but the waitress came back to tell us that they had none. No Cuban Sandwiches at a Cuban restaurant? That should have been my warning sign. When the bill came, we were charged for 3 extra items and a hefty tip was already included. We informed her of the incorrect bill and she corrected it but left the same tip for the higher amount. Basically she gave herself a 28% tip! I corrected the tip but because I know how hard these people have to work for a living I still gave her a 20% tip. Waitress was nice and apologetic but service was mediocre at best. I know there are not many Cuban restaurants in the greater Charlotte area but still would drive past this one to get to another one much further away. I have never said this before but if you're thinking of going here, think twice about it. Honestly, I felt like it was a waste of money."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying my husband and I eat out quite a bit so we are seasoned restauranteurs. 

My husband and I tried this restaurant previously and were not impressed with the service. The food at that time  was good but very slow service. We thought that maybe the busyness of Mother's Day had contributed to the slow service. Well after our most recent visit, it is quite apparent that they just give slow service. Most restaurants give bread that you can munch on while your food is being prepped but not this one. You have to order it like an appetizer to get any. The food is standard but not exceptional. Our reason for going to a restaurant is to eat and not to socialize. For others gathering here as a group function with no rush to get done with their meals, this place would probably be fine. Couldn't help but wonder how the lunch crowd get serviced during the week when their lunch time is limited... Not sure if we'll be back. There are other restaurants that consider the needs of their customers that we'll revisit before Havana."}
{"text":"I love the food here but like a lot of really good places in this area, it can get slow during lunch.  I've also heard they can get really busy at dinner time but I've only had lunch. Try the crispy shredded beef or the milanesa steak."}
{"text":"sadly, meat (Vaca Frita) was greasy, fries were really sad looking, plantains were ok.  service pleasant but not very good.  I read the reviews but someone else picked the place calling it \"hit or miss.\"  Our visit wasn't terrible but I certainly won't be wasting my calories there again.

I don't know what your other options for decent cuban food in the area are, but I would recommend you look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went with a large group to A Piece of Havana and over all had a good experience. I was born in Miami, FL so I am use to Cuban culture and food. Had some croquettas for an appetizer they were ok not quite how I remembered them but not bad. For an entree I had the Havana pork which was much better than the appetizer. My wife had the Milanesa Steak and it was also good. A WARNING this is a Cuban restaurant and is going to have a laid back atmosphere. You will most likely not get in and out quickly. If you want to talk and have a few drinks this is a good place to do it while having decent Cuban food. But if you want a quick meal I would not recommend it. I gave 3 stars becuase although the food was decent I never felt the need to go back again."}
{"text":"A really nice restaurant with great Cuban food...try the beef empanadas!  Service was friendly, but a bit slow.  Drinks were well-made - especially mojitos.  Would certainly recommend a trip to this place...and we look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!!! Service was absolutely terrible!! Went here yesterday with a friend we both order something different. She order shrimp scampi and I ordered Cajun shrimp. My dish was soooo salty, I could barely eat it! It was terrible and my friends pasta was drenched in oil, just disgusting. We ask to speak with a manager and was told thirty minutes of waiting that she wasn't in the building. Needless to say I was very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Not in love but it's good Cuban food. Ox tail was pretty good. I've definitely had better. Their chicken chunks however were really good. It is a citrus alternative to Mexican. I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I have been here multiple times and I would have given it a much higher review had I not had the experience I had last night. I suggested to a few girl friends that we have a Monday night girls night for Sangrias and dinner. I have been here before and the food is always good and the mojitos were always good so seemed like a winner. Well that's where I was apparently wrong. 

Our waitress had to be the nicest WORST waitress in the history of the profession. Two of us got there at 5:30 and were seated at a table. We decided we'd like to move to a booth so we were waiting for the waitress to come back. This is where the night of waiting begins. We didn't get out of this restaurant until about 8:45 when it was all said and done. Every time she'd come by and say oh I'll be right back it became a minimum 30 minute wait. Took us over an hour to get our food not to mention the hour it took us just to get to order the food. The Sangrias were really bad. Tasted like concentrated juice (without added water) and really sweet off red wine. The empanadas were tasty and my friends chicken soup looked and smelled amazing. Our main courses came out not as hot as they should have considering the wait and one of the orders came out wrong. 3 of us ordered the crispy beef and somehow my friend got a different beef dish instead. I got a mojito after the bad sangria which I again didn't drink because the basil was discolored and slimy and it was really watered down. I have never had a bad drink here before so I'm not sure why it was this bad but something changed.

 Now as I was watching I gather they only had 2 people working the floor and the bar last night so they were short staffed. I was prepared to just say okay they are having a bad day. We order dessert, she's picked up the pace here at the end, and the bar has shut down so pretty sure they wanted to close up shop. She brings us our bills and we notice that gratuity has been included already. Also it's a hefty gratuity (over 20%). For my one friend that was the last straw for her and she asked to speak to the manager. We asked if it was customary to add gratuity to a group of 4. He says yes this is what we do here. Then another friend asks but it says we are a table of 6 not 4 on our bills. So then he back tracks and says oh no she put it in wrong etc. (I feel here there is a language issue going on and want to give the benefit of the doubt but I probably shouldn't). The whole thing was a mess. We had an enjoyable night in spite of the bad service but that was due to good company. The food was good but definitely not as hot as it should have been considering how long we waited. 

Overall I'm giving it 3 stars because I've been here before and the food, drinks, and service were good. However If I was basing it on last nights visit I definitely would give it 1 star. Also my tres leches cake was not very good... tasted like grocery store cake where the bottom had been soaked in condensed milk. This could be skewed because I've had amazing tres leches cake in Charlotte and this didn't live up to it."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic atmosphere.  The tiramisu is a must.  Service is a little slow for lunch, but it is part of the culture.  Never been here for dinner but the lot has had cars in it when I've driven by.

The ropa vieja and lechon asada are my favorites"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Love everything I've ever ordered there. I also love the mojitos, they have several flavors and all are homemade, no pre-mixed crap, always a plus! The service is typically very attentive. The atmosphere is nice and would be a great date spot."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews this was a must try while visiting Charlotte. Had the Cuban with sweet plantains the bread was a bit hard but over not to bad."}
{"text":"Simply an excellent place for Cuban cuisine! All the food was flavorful and tasty. Only complaint is that the service is SLOW! I know it's crowded, but to me, that means you need better planning to stay in this business.

But, the food was worth the wait. Just be prepared to tough it out, especially during the weekends."}
{"text":"I promise I wanted to like this place. I moved here from New York and my family is of Cuban descent so I was excited. To see this place...until I tried the food. The sandwiches are DRY. the pork is DRY and unseasoned. All of the food lacked seasoning and the empanadas were more grease than anything. It was very disappointing. I guess for people who don't know what the food is supposed to taste like then this is a great place but I will NEVER eat here again. I literally feel sick and like I'm gonna vomit."}
{"text":"It's rare I come across a place that gets everything right. There's almost always something I'd do differently if I owned the business. But A Piece of Havana is the sort of place where I'd really have to be stretching to find any reasonable criticism.

In the 10-15 times I've been here I've tried several different appetizers, entrees, desserts and cocktails and not once has anything failed to impress. As far as I'm concerned, there are really only a few things a Cuban place has to get right: Cuban sandwich, mojito, ropa vieja, flan and cortadito. And finally, some effort has to be made with the decor and music to make the diner forget for a moment that he/she is actually still in Charlotte, NC. 

In every one of these and many more, A Piece of Havana surpasses expectation. Something as simple as their black beans are the best black beans I've ever had. The flan is also the best I've had, at least outside of the Spanish speaking world. 

Perhaps most impressive, the Cuban sandwich is as good as you're going to get outside of south Florida. I grew up taking family vacations to the Tampa Bay area to visit family. And until I found this place I'd given up on finding a proper Cuban sandwich in Charlotte. I don't know where they get their bread or if they bake it themselves, but it makes the sandwich. Everywhere else, to their eternal shame, seems to substitute French bread."}
{"text":"As with the rest of the reviews, this place is true authentic Cuban cuisine. The food is fresh and loaded with flavor and the portions are average size. Black beans, Cuban Style Ground Beef with rice, Mariquitas with Avocado Dip , and Cuban toast were just a few of the items we really enjoyed. They had live music on the night we were there which was a Friday. If you are looking for a quick meal this is not the place as we were there about 1.5 hours from start to finish. Although a little pricy, you get what you pay for. Will def. be back again."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it! Vaca Frita is incredible. Ropa vieja amazing. Wines are priced fair. Service was great (Betty) - she came by multiple times to check on us. Food was brought out promptly. She also told us that they have live music and turn into a club at night. We lived in Miami before and always look for great Cuban places ... This one will be on the \"Charlotte rotation\"."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Cuban place in town! Their Havana chicken and friend plantains are amazing as are their Cuban sandwiches and sides."}
{"text":"55 minutes and our appetizers are still no where to be seen. The excuse of, \"we are busy\" is not acceptable to paying customers. Going to be busy, staff appropriately"}
{"text":"A Piece of Havana is the kind of restaurant you'd drive past a thousand times and never think to stop.  Then, one day you do and you never stop coming back.  

Located in the way back of a shopping center, you think it's going to be some shlubby fast food dive (not the good kind).  It isn't.  The inside of the restaurant is almost opulent with deep leather booths and romantic curtains over massive windows.  

And then there's the food.  I had the empanadas, Cuban sandwich and my boyfriend had the roasted chicken.  All were outstanding!  In addition, my boyfriend had the Cuban salad.  It had at least an entire avocado sliced along the rim.  It was delicious.  I'm so glad we went and we will keep going back.  Next time, I'm getting the oxtail."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here tonight. We ordered Cuban sampler appetizers, which were very tasty, although some weren't as warm as I'd prefer. The mojitos were fantastic (definitely try the coconut). For dinner, we had the Parrillada Cubana which had pork, Havana chicken, and steak. It was great and I really liked the rice which had a lot of flavor and definitely added a lot to the meal. Our server did a great job pacing the meal for us and she was quite attentive, in spite of what some other reviews have stated. Definitely recommend folks in the area try this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great value. Unbelievable tamales,coconut flan, and my hubby loves the Calle Ochos!"}
{"text":"beautiful place, good food good atmosphere, I like, a excellent care what a great time with my family I recommend for its authentic Cuban food"}
{"text":"Went in for its weekend salsa band and DJ. Had a great time. Bartenders made you feel right at home and were respectful. You've got to try their empanadas. Customers were filled with regulars and friendly with out of towners. Music was awesome!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated quite nicely, though the silverware wrapped in paper napkins took away from the custom made leather chairs. There was a guitar player doing the usual Spanish guitar numbers. There were eight tables seated and two waiters, which may explain why it took 20 minutes to take my order. My waiter was nice and attentive once he came over. Two of the eight tables were speaking Spanish, which could be a good sign that ethnic locals frequent this place.

I had the Original Mojito, Cuban Salad, Pork Chunks with Congri and Plantains. The mojitos here are all made from scratch. My mojito was made right away and was very good. The Cuban Salad came out in about five minutes, and the meal came out a few minutes later. The salad was just as it appears in pictures posted to Yelp. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. The pork chunks were properly marinated and cooked, and were really good. The congri and the plantains were as I expected, which is to say good and authentic.

I ordered the Tres Leches for dessert. While it was ok, it certainly was not authentic. Instead of the real thing, this was a slice of pound cake soaked in condensed/evaporated milk with whipped cream topping covered with a squirt of dulce de leche.

Overall, the food and drinks were great, dessert was ok, and service was ok."}
{"text":"Mostly everything we ordered was good however the cubano sandwich and the fried whole snapper, (4) ordered at our table, not so much. The fish was terribly overcooked and underseasoned and the sandwich was just awful. The bread was hard, meat was cold...it's just wasn't good. The other plates ordered like the seafood salad and ropa vieja were scrumptious! Drinks were good and the service delightful."}
{"text":"Right away I liked the look and \"feel\" of this place.  They were busy for lunch today (a Wednesday) mostly men in white dress shirts and ties filling tables for four.  This place has some character, is comfortable and is a lot nicer looking than I was expecting.

I ask one of the waiters about Cuban Style Espresso and told me to try something else.  I do not speak much Spanish so I have no idea what it was, though the name sounded really good and he seemed confident that I would like it.  Since I believe \"Fortune favors the Bold\" I thought I would see how I liked it.  This Coffee with milk had a good (not great) flavor and it was better than many, though miles from the Great Cuban Style Espresso I'm used to!  What he described as their approach to Espresso Cuban Style sounded close (close but not quite) and I probably should have ordered it and will next time.  OK I know I'm crazy and I do not speak Coffee, so I'm part to blame!

They serve their Cuban Sandwich with Mayonnaise, yet you can choose to have it with none as I did!  This Cuban Sandwich was very good, the pickles were thick, the mustard could have had a less dominant presence though I'm not counting that against it!  Swiss Cheese, Ham and Pulled Pork, YUM!  This sandwich gets 3.85 yelp stars, because I am almost a fan. 

Instead of Fried Potatoes (french Fries) I substituted ($.99) fried Plantains (the sweet kind).  The Plantains were perfect...5 yelp stars!

Soup of the day was Corn (Not the Creamy style) I guess it was a broth or water base, was flavored nicely and had some meat in it, 3 yelp stars.

The service was Superboy on Cuban and if you do not know that is a compliment.  They made one small mistake on my order yet fixed it before it left the kitchen and I know they don't think I saw it.  They put fries on the plate and my server caught it before he picked up the plate to bring it to me.  Five Stars for Service!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Charlotte. Ordered the combo plate and everything was delicious! Chimchurri sauce fresh and delicious. Great monitors. 
Friendly service and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The kids menu was pre cooked and just heated, the beef was dry. My order was cold and my wife's order beef was raw. Prices are expensive for the food they serve. The ecuadorian waitress was very good, she did everything possible for us to enjoy the food but good service does not solve a bad meal."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Charlotte and heard about A Piece Of Havana from some co workers so of course I had to try it. The best days to go if you're into entertainment while you dine are Fridays and Saturdays. On these nights, a live salsa band performs salsa versions of greatest hits. I would recommend making a reservation as it can get extremely crowded on these nights. The waiters are all very friendly. The drinks are good and well priced. The spotlight here is the food. The empanada platter is very good (it comes with 4 empanadas and 4 croquettes. I usually get the Crispy beef which is delicious with the chimichurri sauce on top. The churrasco is also very good. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for cuban food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is going to be one of my new stops when I hit Charlotte. Great food, great service. Lunch prices are very appealing. Entrees come with two sides. Extra sides are very reasonably priced. Had the Havana Chicken, mixed beans/rice, and plantains.  I appreciated that even as a solo diner I didn't feel rushed out during business hour; the place is big enough that the staff isn't rushing to turn over tables. Recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place, authentic Cuban food, first time I went there,  food was delicious  I had the rice with black beans and pulled pork with a side of plantain. Taste great, but then every time I order something they prepare it different from the first time. I know they cannot be changing chef that fast. I also love the Yuca,  but with the constant changes I cannot take it anymore."}
{"text":"The place is nice. I had \"Vaca Frita\" it was OK but it tasted more like \"chimichuri\" than Vaca Frita. They have traditional Cuban sodas like they have back in my home town of Miami. But being from Miami I am spoiled when it comes to Cuban food and am very selective. The \"mariquitas\" (fried plantain chips) were a bit soggy and had too much salt on them. The server was nice but it seemed like it was a Cuban restaurant trying to give the appearance of a Mexican one to gain money from \"anglo locals\" that assume anything \"Latin\" = Mexican. I would go back on Friday Nights when there is a salsa and the Cuban community really comes out.  Overall I liked it."}
{"text":"Not bad, but it could have been a lot better. To be fair even in Miami it's not easy finding really GOOD Cuban cuisine these days.

The Ajiaco soup didn't have any pumpkin or chunks of meat, it was very bland. The roast pork was OK but needed lots more mojito and more onions. The masas de puerco (fried pork chunks) were cut into too small pieces, they were fried right but the chef failed to use any garlic which is a must for that dish. This restaurant doesn't even offer chicharrones de pollo which is like the best fried chicken in the world and the so called \"Cuban turnover\" was an Argentine empanada. 

The sides were solid, the congri (rice and black beans) was not typical but way better than usual, the maduros (sweet plantains) delish and the tostones tasted like.... tostones. 

Prices were very reasonable, portions were generous, service was cheerful and you better drink tons of water before bed to compensate for all that salt. 

There's potential but the chef needs to get a lot bolder with his spice rack, mojito and garlic."}
{"text":"Any Cuban Latin jazzy music fans in the house? If so, I strongly recommend a Friday night visit to a Piece Of Havana. Found within which warm friendly atmosphere, extraordinary service, and drinks that will have you ready to get up and try your steps.
Initially thought of being good and simply ordering a caesar salad, but the lure of oxtails won me over, and oh, was I happy that I made them change. Their oxtails were tender, extraordinarily seasoned, and pleasing to the palate..
A taste of the empanadas also proved to be a wise choice, especially the beef. The washing is down with the cool crisp mojito, I was ready to try my Latin two step on the dance floor with everyone else...
Come on down on Friday night and get your tastebuds pleased and your dance step on at a Piece Of Havana."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment!  I had high hopes but all quickly went downhill when our waiter informed us that most of the ingredients needed for their menu selections were unavailable due to Hurricane Irma - seriously!  Responsible owners should know when to keep their doors closed.  Management made no apologies to customers.   Es Una Pena."}
{"text":"You want legit Cuban food? Come here. - from a cuban
It might take some time to seat you but the food it worth the wait. Abuela's home cooking in Charlotte. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A nice change of pace.  Started with the Havana Sampler which included foods made with corn, plantain, pork, and ham.  All of it very enjoyable. For dinner we split the dinner for two . The pork was incredible and the steak we full of flavor.  Cuban coffee and tres leches for desert were also very pleasing ."}
{"text":"While the cafe con leche and cafe cubano were great, the tostones and croquettes were extremely bland.  The tostones were like eating cardboard, very little seasoning.  Hell, a little salt would have made them better.  Prices were very good.  We got 2 cafe con leches, 1 cafe cubano, order of tostones, and an order of croquettes for $13."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out. We drove over an hour on Friday night. We were told we had to wait 50 minutes to be seated. We waited outside because it was so crowded inside and loud.
Way too loud...not very family friendly. It's more like a nightclub setting not really for intimate dinner or quiet family time.
Very bad service. Bar was rowdy and they had three large parties going on at the same time. We tried to get a drink at the bar, but bartender never acknowledged us. We scrambled to get a menu while we waited but hostess was too busy and snotty.
Reservations are required or a must.
I will not be coming back here.
Ended up at another latin- family friendly restaurant for the evening. We spent over $100.00."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Service was ok, server seemed nice just rushed us because she said the were closing in 20 minutes.  It was only 8:30. Prices are fair I suggest the churrasco steak"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a few friends before we went over to Cajun Canvas.  The atmosphere is nice and festive.  The chairs are all leather, but sit very low.  Our server was friendly, but probably could have checked on us more.  We went for dinner around 5:30 or so and it was pretty empty. 

I ordered the Havana Fantasy drink - and boy, do you get your money's worth!  That drink was strong!  It was very good - and it was $8 - so honestly, I was glad that I could taste the liquor I paid for.  I felt like this place was ok, and fine.  Then our food came...

I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce with Cuban toast and fried yuca.  That's the moment I became a total Piece of Havana fan.  The food was delicious!  The sauce and shrimp dish was just right, the bread was great, and the yuca was crispy and amazing.  Maybe it was the strength of my drink that made my dinner taste so good, but I will definitely be back.  Everything was reasonably priced too, for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"I hate that I didn't have a better experience because I was really looking forward to eating here. 

We made a reservation and ventured out on a Wednesday night.We were promptly greeted and seated in a booth... and then no one ever came back. We waited and waited and waited. We finally waited so long that I got up and went to the bar because that was the only place I could see any of the staff. I told a waitress we'd been sitting for 15 minutes with no server, and she said she didn't know who ours was, but she'd find out. Apparently our waiter was also the bartender. He was really nice, but trying to find him at any point during our meal was like trying to find a needle in a haystack (until it was time to pay and then he was Johnny on the spot.)

Our food was good - we got beef/ham and cheese empanadas to start, and then I got the Havana Pork with plantains and boiled yucca, and the fella got the Fried Pork with rice and green beans - but our service was so terrible that it colored our whole experience.

To end on a positive note, they did have live music, which was a nice touch and not too overpowering."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Cuban restaurant before today. Having been exposed to Cuban culture through my wife's family, I have only tasted some homemade Cuban food. 
My wife and I ate pork and beef empanadas to start with. Pork is the best. We then ordered skirt steak / black beans and rice and the cubed pork /black beans and rice. We were totally impressed with the food.
The service was excellent and the waiter patiently explained what we didn't know about the food we were ordering. I finished with Cuban coffee. I never tasted Cuban coffee before. I had two cups! The only negative was the iced tea. It was very weak and I could have read a newspaper through it.
Totally great experience ! We will be back !"}
{"text":"Visited this location while in town on vacation! and wow! this place is lively and jumping on a Friday night.  I think it was because a local group was there meeting up.  Either way the Spanish band was fantastic.  I love live music! and people were dancing salsa.  It was very loud and I could hardly hear what my date was saying.  The food was just ok for me.  There was not a lot of seafood options of my liking, but I made do with was was there.  It was so so.  the fish I had was very tangy as if it was seasoned with lemon juice.  Everything else was good! I give it an A for atmosphere and and B- for food!  that's my food truth!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed! And after reading the first few post on Yelp we should have walked out! But we gave it a chance.
Nothing like a \"Real Cuban Restaurant\" An hour before even getting there the phone rings...rings...or busy but when someone finally picked up and I asked I was put on hold forever and he NEVER came back on!! The hostess said it would take 45-to an hour wait. After an hour wait we are still waiting but we 2 big groups of people to sit. When I approach the hostesses reminding her I been waiting and I was there prior to those groups. I was told they had reservations lol!!! WOW!!!! 
Finally we got to sit down to a table with nothing!!! No water!!! No Cuban bread with butter!!! Crackers!!!!NOTHING!!!!! 10mins later the waitress decided to show up. By this point we had our order ready. No \"oh give us a min\" we told her everything we wanted. When the food comes out she tells me they ran out of fried banana?! HELLO?! Seriously?! For the prices they charge the portions are small!!  My breaded steak was brunt, the chicken my step daughter got was super small and my husband steak was very skippy!! 
Not sure why we ordered cafe con leche more or a disappointment!! It was rusty!! Then they only have just plain flan?! Once again even more disappointing!!
I'm honestly convinced the owners are not Cuban this would have NEVER happen in Miami or Jersey!! This is why Cuban restaurant never make it here in Charlotte. Considering this is the ONLY!! One how they made it around this long oh yea because people do not know how bad it is!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in the greater Charlotte area.  Amazing Cuban food (recommend the garlic shrimp), great atmosphere, authentic mojitos and very reasonably priced.  You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I met some friends for lunch here on a monday. When we walked in, we were seated promptly by the host and given menus. The atmosphere was very nice, and we were looking forward to our meal.

Unfortunately, our waiter seemed as if he didn't want to be there. we waited about 20 minutes for drinks, and another 20 for him to come take our order (and he only came over because we were all staring expectantly at him). He never came to check on us once, unless we got up to get him, or flagged him down (which was difficult, as he never seemed to look towards the tables, instead keeping his head down over the screen to the POS ordering system).

Once the food came, everything was delicious, flavorful, and well prepared. Such a shame that the horrible service ruined it for us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot.  I love everything I have ever ordered.  The plantains are always cooked just right and the service is wonderful.  Very authentic Cuban food!!!"}
{"text":"Crispy beef OH MY! Delicious food. Live entertainment. Good people. I still don't think they cooked my food in olive oil like the waiter said though..."}
{"text":"In Atlanta, there was a shack of a Cuban restaurant that was so authentic they had a picture of the raft they came over on (I'm not kidding about that). I ate there at minimum once a week.
While not quite as good, this place has been the closest I have found so far. Definitely a lot more upscale than my Atlanta spot, which had bars on the windows, but the food was really good and reasonably priced.
I had a beef empanada and the Media Noche. The Media Noche was pretty good but the empanada was outstanding. If I had any room in my stomach, I would have ordered 2-3 more of them. 
They place is tucked away at the end of a strip mall but now that I've found it, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went with a prearranged large party. Service was terrible, because the support staff was not supporting our waiter. Drink orders were taken once, delivered, some to the wrong people, and almost never thought thought of again. When they finally took or orders (40 minutes after we arrived) it still took another 40 to be served.

The food was far from good either. The seafood and chicken in all the dishes was overcooked and tough. The only reason our drink and water glasses got filled was because all of us were asking. No one even came and asked how the meal was.

I spoke to the owners, a husband and wife, and while she was somewhat apologetic, she several times tried to lay the blame on our group for not telling them what to do. Hey, hears an idea - how about you the owner come over and see if everything is okay.

In the end we were served three complimentary flans, but it didn't make the situation any better, especially since the came out over cooked and burnt on the bottom.

I don't think any of us are ever going back."}
{"text":"Nice place!, very good service, and very good food at average prices....Havana sampler app was very good way to try all the \"basics\", and all were very good..."}
{"text":"I ordered at dinner a Delicious veggie platter -under salads! Came with veggies and plantains! I ordered with yellow rice and veggies .Beans would be a perfect addition as then would be a complete protein! All delicious! Colorful and I will be back! 
Husbands Mahimahi was good but he felt portion was on the smaller side, flavorful though!"}
{"text":"Disappointed...we wanted to try this restaurant. We arrived 25 minutes before they closed, and the restaurant was almost empty, but we were told that they couldn't seat us because they were going to close. You only get one chance to make an impression, folks."}
{"text":"Go someplace else. Had dinner here and we spent $50 (with no drinks) and left dissatisfied. We left thinking the only thing that was enjoyed were the plantains. It is a clean restaurant with attentive service though.

Visited October 2013"}
{"text":"Was pleased to find this restaurant in North Carolina, the Cuban sandwich was a miss But the plantains were good as well as the flan. Fried steak was a tad over cooked. Black Beans were excellent. Service was attentive and I look forward to trying some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Even if you have never had Cuban food before, I am sure you will find something you like on the menu.  Definitely worth trying!

Service:  Excellent.

Ambience:  Nice outdoor seating - don't feel like you are in a strip mall at all.  Inside has plenty of seating, nice decor and a bar.

Food:  Have eaten there several times and tried something new each time - great selection on their menu.  The food is very good.  Nice flavor and cooked correctly.  Portions are good.  

Price is fair."}
{"text":"Quiet place for a quick lunch. Nice, low music, service was great, had the Cuban sandwich with the green hot chili sauce, absolutely amazing & tasty."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants and the price is very reasonable. Start with a Calle Ocho Mojito. They grind mint leaves into it and use cane sugar. 

I typically get the chicken empanadas and the shrimp in garlic sauce. The shrimp includes either yellow rice or plantains. I like to double up on the plantains. For dessert, I get the coconut flan and two cuban coffees. Awesome! The food is great. The service is good.

There is live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  It can be a bit loud.  If that is an issue for you, there is outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This food is decent however the service is incredibly slow so if your in any rush don't nothing coming."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and has great customer service. The live band is amazing and plays great music to dance. But, the food is awful to say the least. There is nothing authentic about it. There were 8 of us at the table and no one liked their food. The appetizers were so low on salt that they didn't taste like anything. Our entrees were all cold and taste was horrible. You could tell the food was not fresh and just been reheated upon serving. Honestly, it is a shame that the food is not good as their ambiance and music is amazing. In my opinion the owners should really look into having better quality when it comes to food. Also, although the service from our waiter was good, it did seem they were very pushy all the time asking what else were we going to order when we really wanted to take it slow. Have some appetizers at first and drinks. Then order our entrees, after all a place like this is inviting for you to stay the night consuming and dancing. Yet it seemed like they wanted us served and out. Mind you, we were a party of 8 consuming and there was no waiting line of people wiating to come in. Honestly, I would love to go back only for their music but would definitely not eat here again. I really hope one day they actually serve good authentic Cuban food with quality as this would probably help the business a lot."}
{"text":"Came here one weekend night with a group of friends.  The food was delicious and authentic. The black beans and rice are a must. Make sure you finish dinner with a Cuban coffee! This would be a 4 star review if not for the speed of service. Our waiter was extremely polite and great at providing recommendations, but our drinks went empty more than once and we were almost finished with our main dishes before our sides showed up. That being said, I'd have no reservations about giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Very nice interior, welcoming and friendly staff, and a solid Cubano sandwich make this place a must try.  The prices are extremely reasonable for a night out with the family.  I have been living in the Charlotte area for 4 years now and don't think I have had better service and friendliness from any other area restaurant.  You just can't go wrong by grabbing your next lunch or dinner here.  I have also been with large groups and they are very accommodating and keep the drinks full!"}
{"text":"As a Cuban, I always look for a Cuban place and visiting Charlotte,I decided to try this and it was good. The drinks were excellent- great mojito and margaritas. We ordered the Havana sampler that is so worth it- tamal, pork,Maduros, tostones, yuca, croquetas, and empanadas- the tamal was the only disappointment - the rest were great!
I ordered the rabo and it was ok- not like the one at Versailles- and the rice was a major disappointment- hard and old. The yuca with mojo also was not up to par.
Overall good music, good drinks, great cortado . The rice was a disappointment and not worthy of Cuban since in general, the Cuban rice is fabulous."}
{"text":"Coming from NJ where Cuban restaurants are aplenty, my expectations of quality authentic Cuban food are high. I am pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant meets my expectations. The food was delicious and the atmosphere supported the authenticity of the food. I am looking forward to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"This was the second time we had lunch in this joint.  First time I had the crispy shredded beef and the woman had a Cuban sandwich.  Both were pretty good along with some tostones and plantains.   Crispy beef was a bit oily but I ate every bite of it.  This time I had the garlic shrimp and tostones and boiled yucca and the gal had some skirt steak with rice and beans and a couple plantains again.  Skirt steak was ordered well done and was a little chewy which is expected cooked well but did taste good.  The garlic shrimp was decent some where cooked better than others, I like my shrimp cooked longer, more well done, a couple were that way and a few were softer, not as good.  Yucca was perfectly cooked and tostones,  well, it's hard to mess up a tostones,  so it was good as well.  Service was good, waiter was very attentive,  didn't have to look for him for anything.   Food was out in good time, place was busy for a lunch crowd.  I will have to try it one night for dinner, looks like the drinks are worth trying as well. Adios for now."}
{"text":"I went last Saturday. All the reviews said service was slow so I expected slow. To my surprise service was great. They were full capacity and service and food great. The best of our table was the ribs OMG EVER BODY said the same thing FANTASTIC. I hade the steak which was great. The chimichuri Sauce  great. I will be back a great find. Yucha fried yummy. The appetizer platter was a not miss"}
{"text":"After hearing several co-workers brag on this place I had to check it out, I love Cuban food. The two of us got there at 7pm on a Monday night, were seated right away, there was 4 other tables with guests inside and 2 outside. Some were just having drinks. There were 2 servers, 1 bartender and 1 cook from what I could tell. We ordered within 10 minutes and we had the Starter Family meal that has a combination which is perfect for introducing someone new to Cuban food like my guest. We had , shredded Pork, Grilled Chiken and specialty thinly sliced, pounded sirloin. We also had Plantains, white rice and black beans.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after we ordered which seemed long given the low crowd in the restaurant. When the food came it smelled great but was luke warm and it almost seemed like they had forgotten about us given the time and temp ? I did not send the food back (which is rare for me) because it was all together. Despite the coolness, the food still tasted great. Full of Cuban flavors and in the end I was content. My guest also enjoyed the food but expected a little more. Over all I will recommend them but just plan on a long wait and be sure to get it at the right temp and you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Growing up in Tampa, Florida I consider myself an amateur Cuban food foodie..... I lived on shredded mojo pork, rice and beans, plantains, ropa vieja, Cuban toast, and other Cuban specialties and I know good food....... So when another Yelper Elite and I decided to scope out a new place in another part of Charlotte.  Going back to my roots, we ended up at A Piece of Havana.  I ordered the shredded pork with white beans and rice along with a side of plantains.  She ordered the crispy shredded beef with yellow rice and plantains.  Mine came correctly and hers came with yellow rice and black beans but no plantains.  It was corrected by the server promptly after I sampled mine and determined that they were too nice to pass up! So the pork was melt-in-your mouth tender with delicious mojo seasoning..... The rice and beans were tasty but the plantains were carmelized perfectly and complimented the dish amazingly.  I WILL be back to try the Cuban sandwich! A must try in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"WOW is what I thought when I finally found a restaurant to take my husband to that caters to the Latino. He is Puerto Rican and we have yet to find anywhere to eat since we moved here in August, 2006. We found one place - I am naming no names - but it was not authentic and we were excited to go out to this place for his birthday dinner. We got there and were seated quickly. We loved the atmosphere and thought surely the service and the food would measure up...NOT - it took forever to get our drinks, we had a party of 5 - including 3 adults - and only got 5 rolls. They don't have Cuban bread! They even only brought 3 pats of butter. It took the waiter several times to understand our order so when it was my husband's turn to order - he ordered in Spanish which the waiter still didn't seem to understand. Our food came out with the white rice cold, the tostones cold, the plantains cold - my chicken soup never came - the waiter said he thought I said I didn't want it??? My Chicken Milanesa was not supposed to have onions but I bit right into one! The tostones were soft not firm - the yellow rice was weird - not authentic and I have had plenty of arroz amarillo in my day. We asked for more bread on several occasions and it never came, nor did our refills. When we asked the last time for more bread - we were told it would take 7 minutes!!! We told the waiter of our dissatisfaction and he didn't say too much. When the check finally came - the waiter said - the owner gave you a discount and some coupons...A 10% discount off of a $55- $60 bill! The coupons were what they would give anyone - buy 1 entree and 2 drinks and get one half off! I will never go back here again! What a waste!"}
{"text":"As a native South Floridian partially raised by Cubans, I know my way around Cuban cuisine. Reading through some of the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to go to A Piece of Havana, knowing that my hopes and dreams of a walk down memory lane could easily be dashed. Suffice it to say, I'm glad my fear of disappointment didn't get in the way of my need to reminisce. 
We went at kind of an off time: 3pm on Saturday and there were very few people there. We were greeted and seated right away, then the fun began. Our server was delightful, especially since she was helping me persuade my fellow dining compatriots to enjoy some adult libations with me. 
Mojitos, Cuban bread, crispy shredded beef, Havana chicken, shrimp, black beans and rice, and Cuban coffee...?! You can't go wrong and I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now..I've gotten the same Cuban sandwich. Awesome both times. Not dry, seasoned right. However, this time I got a drink. No complaints onthe taste of the drink. Actually it sad quite strong with excellent taste, however, I had to go to the bar area to order it. The place wasn't crowded and I arrived after the rest of my party, but I still expected service. They still deserve a 5 star because all else was fine. I just really wanted a drink. :) Customer service regardless for what needs extra attention.."}
{"text":"I tried this place on the recommendation of coworkers. I was hesitant but was in the mood for something different. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was very good, restaurant was clean and enjoyed the Cuban music playing. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was the service. There are some good and not so good members on the waitstaff. Waiting thru most of my meal for someone to come by to see if we need anything was a bummer. Any good waiter/tress will stop by a few minutes after food is served to check on the table. I will continue to keep dining here despite the spotty service."}
{"text":"Decent mojitos.  Food is O.K., but way overpriced for portions that are not very generous."}
{"text":"This was a great spot. Even better experience. My wife & I loved it. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Dark 
Service : friendly 
Food : meh ... i ordered  the yellow rice  and veggies which tasted like it came out of a box of Goya Spanish rice and was have been here for a while . The tostones were also kinda old tasting . The chicken Milanese  was pretty tasty . Ice tea was flavorless . All and it was not terrible but it wasn't great either . I so wanted to like this place . Perhaps I should have order something else ?"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Live music, delicious Cuban food & beautiful atmosphere. I highly recommend this place if you love Cuban food and live music."}
{"text":"Oh man, I was such a fan of this place but the quality of the food is so inconsistent, you never know if the food will be good or mediocre. But the WORST part about this place is the blue hair girl that works front of the house. OMG I have never met someone so entitled and rude! I am guessing she is the owner's daughter bc there is no other way you would have someone with such poor people skills in the front. It is so bad that when you go during their peak hours and are waiting for a table, random people bond over her horrible service. She is so rude to customers and the rest of the staff, it seriously puts a huge dent in your dining experience. 
I do want to note that everyone else in the staff is great! Always nice, polite and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Music and environment was entertaining. I went specifically for paella and was disappointed. Will return to try another dish."}
{"text":"1st time trying Cuban food and it did not disappoint! The food, the drinks, and the service was great! We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the live band was a nice touch to seal the deal.  We'll definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"nice cuban dandwich recommend?crisp bread with grill pulled chicken and ham with fries  Nice for a lunch."}
{"text":"LOVED the crispy Beef with Rice & Beans and Pantains!!! Amazing! I will try the Cuban Sandwich during my next visit. There is a small stage and dance floor....I assume there's a live band during the week. Service was great and the food was amazing. I plan to attend a live show next visit."}
{"text":"I've been back to A Piece of Havana twice since my initial review.  I have not encountered the snooty person as on my first visit and have found everyone to be very friendly here.

On my second visit here, I just went with something listed as a favorite on the menu and it was decent, just not something I was expecting.  On my most recent visit, I asked my server for a recommendation and he recommended a shredded beef dish. 

Now I am not a big beef eater but this dish was absolutely amazing.  The crispness of the beef is what did it to me along with the chimichuri sauce.  For a side item, get the green beans!  They are very flavorful.  The fried Yuca was good too but I've had better at a Peruvian place.

I spent a little time talking to my server and I think this is a place I will bring the dinner group very soon.  I've never been here for dinner and some of their menu options they only offer for dinner so I am looking forward to trying them.

One odd thing,  The chairs here are custom made.  The backs and seats seem to be made out of leather.  The only problem is that I sunk down a bit when I sat down.  I felt like I was sitting in a hole.  But that's the only flaw I saw with my latest visit.

Good stuff.  Check it out sometime!!!"}
{"text":"Live music made me feel like I was actually in Cuba or Puerto Rico! The atmosphere was live with people dancing on this Saturday night.

 However, I didn't like the first waitress attitude as the first thing she said to us was that they were closing at 10 (we sat down 9:10). Like it's not about to close for almost one more hour! After we ordered our drinks, a different waitress took our food order. She was nice & courteous, and remained with us for the remainder of the night. 

We ordered the Empanadas as an appetizer, Chicken Hemingway (chicken wrapped in bacon), shrimp in garlic sauce and chicken alfredo as the entrees. The Empanadas and shrimp in garlic sauce were tasty. The Chicken Hemingway could have used more marinade and seasoning as it was kind of dry and bland.  The Chicken Alfredo was okay, just a different sauce that we are not used to. Overall, I would come back to hear the live music and try something different the next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place but the amount of food just doesn't match the price. Flavors are good, servings are small. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  A real gem of a find.  Best mojo pork in the Carolinas
My wife and I came here on the recommendations of friends.  Can't than them enough.  Great service.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Considering I've eaten twice here in 30 days I decided it's time for an updated review.

Every visit I have made to this restaurant the food has been delicious and except for my first experience the wait staff has been good.

What to try here:

The empanada sampler - they taste amazing and come hot fresh out of the oven! The dipping sauces served alongside the empanadas are a wonderful flavor addition.
The Argentinian Parrillada with Malbec - I am going to venture a guess this meal would comfortably feed 3 instead of the 2 advertised. The real surprise when we ate this meal was that on a plate of meats, including steak, I have to say the chicken was the winner! I don't particularly care for bone in chicken but it was prepared perfectly with generous seasoning and every bite was juicy! 
The Cuban sandwich - I can only get so excited about a sandwich personally but my fiancé adores this sandwich and orders it consistently when we go for lunch. 
Chicken Bacardi Alfredo - I am surprised to be saying this as well but my friend ordered this at lunch and I had some serious food envy! The Bacardi alfredo sauce was unique and delicious.

It's proven to be a solid date night location with large comfortable booths and consistently delicious food and drink specials. I am glad I went back and tried them again."}
{"text":"The waiter looked like he wanted to be elsewhere, he wasn't welcoming and seemed bored every time he had to come to our table. Not only was that putting us off but the food was cold when we got it and it was lacking flavor. Not interested in visiting again."}
{"text":"Went went on a Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was a GREAT night!  The food was delicious (we had one of the combo dishes for 2), the Sangria was fantastic, and the band/DJ had everyone on their feet!  We loved every bit of it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WTH!?  No Media Noche or Bistec Empanizado on the menu.  Turn in your Cuban card! JK.
Jason the server was good, the Mojito and Masa de Puerco Frito were on point as was the Havana Sampler.  Would have been a 4 but you need to work on getting customers seated quicker, you weren't that busy."}
{"text":"I liked  some things about A Piece of Havana quite a bit. The place is very nice in terms of atmosphere, the garlic shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the wine-broth was very tasty. There were a few hiccups though; while service was friendly, it took a long time to get our lunch and my portion was on the small side. I was actually kind of hungry when I left, which is never a good sign.  Looking at other photos on Yelp it may have just been my entree- so maybe next time I'd opt for rice instead. I also thought the tostones were bland & the green beans next to them were super salty. My best guess is maybe they just salted the green beens twice instead of both of the side dishes? Anyway, I would definitely give them another shot-as overall the main dish did taste good & they have some great sounding cocktails on the menu."}
{"text":"Athentic Cuban restaurant. The \"congri\" and the \"vaca frita\" were excellent.  Good food all around. Good live music and good mojitos. It's hard to find good Cuban food outside Miami, this place was really a piece of Cuba in North Carolina. I will return and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Saturday noon and it was closed. It looked dirty inside, some used lime slices on one table. I tried the phone number and no answer. I went by the hours indicated on yelp or their web page so wasted a trip out there."}
{"text":"We went here in a whim after seeing the movie Chef and getting excited about Cuban food! 
It was amazing! We had a lot of dishes between is both vegetarian and fish and Cuban platter! 
There was great music, the other patrons were dancing ! A comedian from
Venezuela had the mike for awhile which was good if you understood Spanish! Not if you didn't!! 
Would I go here again? You bet"}
{"text":"I visited this treasure for the first time last night. I Googled best Mojitos in Charlotte and \" A Piece of Havana \" popped up. I was there  celebrating my 45th Birthday. Several other parties were going on at the same time as mine so it was on fire.. First off  the drinks are great! Nothing watered down at this place. I think they have over 15 mojitos. I ordered the skirt steak, green beans and rice. The steak and beans were seasoned to perfection the rice was good as well. They have live music and a small dance floor. I was very impressed. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I am from Miami and love Cuban food. They do a good job and have a really nice place. Go, eat, Easy to get to too."}
{"text":"Mojitos are very good.  Empanadas are delicious.  What a great restaurant, so excited that Charlotte has a great Cuban place to eat!  
If you are even considering a visit, by all means come here for a great meal.
Picadillo is also very good.  Great steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Great Mojitos!! Excellent skirt steak, rice and beans, fried yuca, and fried plantains!  Cool atmosphere.  Very welcoming."}
{"text":"Honestly, every time I come here I am extremely satiated. Only once was there a tiny blip but I'm going to chalk it up to a bad day. (There was absolutely no stuffing in the croquetas and the waiter would not replace them with fresh ones with actual stuffing) 

BESIDES THAT... 

I truly enjoy bringing friends here, coworkers, clients, my boyfriend and family here. I recently moved up to Charlotte from Miami in January so your girl KNOWS her cuban food. Although I would not really classify this as 100% cuban eats - this place does have your Cuban staples and the savory flavors are undeniable. 

I've tried their churrasco, roasted chicken (my fave when I ate meat) and most recently the grilled mahi-mahi. All were superb. Highly recommend any of these options if you are indecisive. 

They also have a pretty extensive mojito selection which I have been dying to try!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to check out this spot for drinks and to listen to music. I always wanted to visit the restaurant. The lady that was performing Wanda Lopez was very good. She had people up dancing and enjoying the music. The restaurant was full. There were a few birthday parties going on that night. The highlight was seeing Coach Riveria for the Carolina Panthers there with his family and friends while we waited. There was no one to greet us when we walked in. After having to ask for the host we were told there was no tables available. So we sat the bar. I had a pina colada without alcohol. It was too sweet. The pork bites were nicely seasoned and good. I will probably visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! The only reason I didn't give perfect 5 was because the space is very small and crowded and I ordered a sampler plate so that I could try multiple items, and the roasted pork was AMAZING, the steak was \"good\", but the chicken was \"blah\"....
We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and he and I both had a wonderful time-- the band was absolutely amazing, the vibe made us feel like we were in Little Havana in Miami, everyone- patrons included- were happy and lively and having a wonderful time. If only they had a bigger space so that you didn't feel so crowded it would have been perfect. 
And again, the food was delicious, over all, but I feel on a sampler plate where they have chosen the best of the best authentic items for your to sample, everything on the plate should be outstanding. The chicken was really dry and wasn't seasoned....the steak, again, was good, but not great....the star, by far was the roasted pork...OMG!! Soooooooo Amazing! I truly hope they expand and open another one of these somewhere else in Charlotte, as I feel it This cuisine and culture is missing here(and I live in Mint Hill, so SteeleCreek is kinda far for us to get to).  Can't wait for an opportunity to return...."}
{"text":"Nice place tucked away in Steele Creek. Service was excellent. It took a little longer than normal to receive dinner since there was a private event. There is live music  each day. The bartenders were very attentive and polite. Food was hot and savory!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Cuban fan and had such high hopes of this place, but unfortunately am leaving disappointed.
Ordered the Lechon Asado lunch portion with boiled yuca and plantains (my go to dish). Pork was cooked very good but the marinade was incredibly salty to the point of being overpowering. This is not normal for this dish.  The yuca was very undercooked and tough to cut/chew. Plantains were great, but also pretty hard to mess up. 
All said, the price was great at $6.95 but flavor and quality were very low too. Too bad because they have a great atmosphere for sitting in a strip mall area."}
{"text":"Food was tasty as usual but the service left much to be desired. We arrived around 630 and it took nearly 2 hours for our food to arrive. A couple in group received their food absolutely cold with apology or concerns about that. Makes me skeptical to return here unfortunately"}
{"text":"Decided to try this local Cuban cuisine.  Service was great.  My shrimp scampi wasn't what I expected.  Shrimp with plain pasta and parmesan sprinkled on it.  Husband ordered a large plate that had mixed seafood and rice.  Very good!  Be forewarned, this is authentic so if order a plate that says calamari...you're going to get whole baby squid.  Not strips of calamari.  Live band plays at 7 p.m. (at least on Fridays).  We plan on going back!!"}
{"text":"The best lunch value around.  The crispy beef is awesome.  They make everything fresh and the food is very good.  Dinner portions are enough to share."}
{"text":"Really good Cuban food for being north of Tampa! The Cuban sampler appetizer was great and the ropa vieja was really tasty."}
{"text":"Tried the mojo pork with green beans & plantains. Will def go back when i'm up that way."}
{"text":"This place is a local secret. If you like Cuban this is as authentic as I've found in the area. Crispy pork and plantains are the best thing on the menu. The mojitos are off the charts! Kid friendly and tons of fun on salsa night :)"}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a Costa Rican friend of mine.  It did not disappoint!! My husband and I came here for dinner on a weeknight to celebrate our anniversary and LOVED it.  The Long Island Lemonade was a tasty drink to start off the night.  We got the sampler platter, and the empanadas were BY FAR the best I've ever had.  Fried plantains were perfect.  Our seafood paella was to die for.  Capped the evening off with a cuban coffee, and boy did that ever give us a jolt!  But, it hit the spot.  The tiramisu was great for a Cuban place (thought it was an Italian specialty).  Our server was so very kind and attentive.  I loved it!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good .. had the mojo shredded pork with Cuban rice and beans and tostones .. empanadas as apps .. everything was very good!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised and delighted with my meal.  Went during lunch.  Service was prompt and food came out fast.  Food was very flavorful, reminded me of some of the Cuban food I had in Miami.  The Mojitos were absolutely delish.  I suggest the Mango because it was made with real fruit.  The ones without fruit(peach for instance was peach flavored syrup) were still good and had the basics (lemon, mint) but didn't taste as authentic to me( though very good).  I would go definitely go again if I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last night and had sort of a bumpy experience. As a disclaimer, this was Valentine's Day weekend, so I can understand them being stretched thin. Although, the restaurant was never totally full during our time there. 

There was PLENTY of staff to go around, but it still took a very long time for our server to approach. We placed orders, no problem, but almost never saw our server for the rest of the night. Others came around to top-off our drinks...at one point, topping off my diet soda with sweet tea. Somehow, our absentee server saw this happen and brought a replacement, which was nice. 

Food was just okay. The Cubano is not the best I've had, and the fried yuca was disappointing. We never did get silverware, and only got napkins because a bus boy spilled water on us. Also took ages to get the bill, which turned out to be for a different table. So we had to hunt down our sever again and have her fix 

Overall, the place is clean, staff is friendly enough, and they have good live music some nights. Maybe they are better on a regular night. I doubt we'll go back, though."}
{"text":"I really like Cuban food so this was a big disappointment to me.  Not only was my stewed beef rojas WAYYY over salted, and my sides portons absurly small, but my service  - well every one's service - all 8 of us at different tables in the place - was lacking. I wasnt the only one neck craning for some service. and I thought the pricing on the menu was a little on the high side for steel creek. Maybe it was because it was Sunday afternoon??  who knows.  Nice decor, spacious, big bar. that's the good parts and the good note I'll leave it on....."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times. Time after time I always wonder why I even bother to return. The food is either a hit or miss but the service has always been a miss. It's almost as if you are inconveniencing them to dine there and for that I don't plan on returning anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Second try, never returning. I've been in the industry for a long time and I understand things happen but twice within two years means management doesn't care enough to stay on top of their employees. My ceviche was good, not the best I've ever had but edible. My husband's food was just gross - seriously,  how do you mess up a sandwich and fries? The fries weren't even cooked all the way. It took the server 45 minutes to take our order, two people at our table waited 15 minutes longer to get their food, beers were warm and mixed drinks ice was melted by the time it got to our table.  We would've said something but we only saw our server twice the whole time. I wish the server didn't add gratuity because she certainly didn't deserve it, not to mention adding gratuity automatically now is against the law for a few years now. Maybe if you didn't let your servers add gratuity I wouldn't be writing this review because she may have actually tried to do her job. The one positive was the band was pretty good."}
{"text":"My friends and I needed a pick me up.  My girlfriend's part Cuban, my guy friend is Puerto Rican and I'm part Ecuadorian.... 

This place was like \"home\" cooking for all of us!  

Rice and beans, fried pork, plantains, guacamole, yucca, soup, Cuban sandwiches, mango and other fresh fruit  milkshakes,  flan ... REAL FRESH CREAMY FLAN... , tres leches cake .... And to top it off Cuban cafe au lait.

As for the decor... It was like stepping into my Ecuadorian family's restaurant in Quito... dark wood, high back leather chairs, deep red curtains and wrought iron accents, tiled dance floor ... and the service was just like family ... welcoming and generous to a fault.

Yup ... It's ALL that ... And did I mention the food is to die for... 

One of our new favorite places for sure... And one of these nights my Mamacita is going to light up the dance floor."}
{"text":"We came here last night to celebrate my aunt's birthday. We were greeted by Arnaldo, a friendly waiter who tended to our needs throughout the night. We were a party of approximately 20 people so our service was a little slower than it would for a smaller party. Going to dinner with a large party, a longer wait is to be expected so it wasn't a big deal. I ordered the mango mimosa and it was quite tasty!! For dinner, I had the shrimp with garlic sauce and chose yellow rice with veggies and Cuban toast as my sides. The shrimp was DELISH!! The yellow rice with veggies was a little on the salty side but I ate it all so I suppose it wasn't entirely TOO salty, lol! My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and it tasted excellent! It was my first Cuban sandwich and I'm not a huge pork eater but ended up eating the second half of his sandwich for lunch today! The prices are reasonable but my cousin ordered a strawberry/mango margarita and it tasted too sweet and syrupy. I would recommend you try the mimosas!! Everyone was pleased with theirs! The restaurant itself is clean and the bathroom was nice! 

It was also a plus that Arnaldo was willing to hold my aunt's birthday cake in the cooler until it was ready to be cut. Little things like that make for a more memorable experience. I will be going back with my husband so we can try other dishes and have a few mimosas!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The oxtails are really good and meaty...the service is really slow.."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!  Food was cold!  I would recommend you go to Taco Bell instead!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, 12hour slow cooked roast pork ... yes! give me some please 

I don't visit Cuban restaurants often but this one delivered in taste . $11.98 for a dinner size portion of pork , yellow rice , and black beans is a bit steep for lunch but it was worth it . the lunch portion is $7.95 but I can't imagine getting full off of it.  

Only negative I have for this visit was my coworker ordered the house sandwich and they couldn't fix it bc they didn't have any potato croquettes... they suggested a Cuban sandwich instead which was disappointing bc you get a Cuban anywhere . However, huge plus for giving a discount for the inconvenience.  

Service was fast, friendly , and I love it when my drink is always filled ."}
{"text":"After a recent visit to FL and enjoying a great Cuban meal there, we decided our craving for Cuban food was worth 30-mile drive to give Piece of Havana a try.  We were not disappointed!

We started the meal with two mojitos, and a pork empanada for me and the soup of the day for my hubby (Ajiaco Cubano for Saturday).  I loved the empanada - it was the perfect portion, it wasn't too greasy, and the pork filling was very flavorful.  My hubby also enjoyed his soup which was full of meat.

For our entrees, I had the fried pork chunks with white rice and plantains.  The rice was nicely flavored (with butter?), the pork was crispy but a tad dry, and the plantains were nicely cooked and not too sweet.  This was a great value for $9.95.

My hubby had the crispy shredded beef with yellow rice and black beans for $10.95.  His rice was just as good as mine, and the beans were well flavored.  We actually preferred each other's entrees, and so we switched halfway through.  His beef was topped with a delicious chimichurri sauce that made the dish for me.

We didn't have room for dessert, but we had to try their Cuban coffee.  Basically, it's sweetened espresso.  They were a tad sweeter than I prefer, but the coffee was good and strong.

Service was fast and efficient.  The dining room is also very nice, and we had a spacious booth for the two of us.

I haven't tried any other Cuban restaurants in CLT yet (really, there aren't many!), but given the great food, prices, and service, we'll definitely make a return trip to PoH very soon!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and the service was absolutely horrible. It took 1.5hrs to get our drinks, mind you our table was right next to the bar.  The waitress was clueless. The food came out 3hrs after ordered...some over cooked, some undercooked and some didn't even get their food at all. My salmon was burnt, dry and served with no dressing  (see picture below). They had the nerve to bill us for food that we refused to eat. Not to mention, the bartender made my drink and was licking and sucking his fingers in the process. My friends wine glasses were dirty with lipstick stains on it. When confronted about the drinks, they got an attitude. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I got a beef dish wirh yellow rice. The cilantro sauce is so good! Live entertainment was awesome! Very busy and very slow service."}
{"text":"Good and atmosphere was amazing. Def felt like I was not in Charlotte for a couple hours."}
{"text":"I grew up in South Florida and have a Cuban mom so I know Cuban food. Unfortunately A Piece of Havana does not quite get Cuban food right. I am not saying the food is bad. It is just not Cuban. Other reviews here who claim to be Cuban or from South Florida and give this place rave reviews, I am not sure what Cuban restaurants or food they ate.

Let me give you a few examples. Their Cuban sandwich has mayonnaise in it. Cuban sandwiches do not have mayonnaise in them. They douse their Palomilla steak with Chimichurri sauce. Palomilla steaks do not have Chimichurri sauce. They put soggy onions on their Palomilla steak. Palomilla steak is supposed to have either raw onions or lighly cooked but still crispy onions on it. They put raisins in their Picadillo. I have never ate at any other Cuban restaurant that they put raisins in their Picadillo (although I have been told that some Cubans do cook it this way). And their white rice is completely off. Lacks the flavor or consistency of real Cuban white rice. If you want an example of Cuban/Colombia white rice done properly, head over to Los Paises instead (which BTW is great and truly authentic Colombian food).

To me it seems like they have \"Americanized\" their meals so it lacks the true Cuban authentic feel and flavor. Again the food is not bad, but it is just not \"Cuban\" to me.

I have been to A Piece of Havana many times throughout the years. I always go back hoping it improves since unfortunately we don't have many other choices here in Charlotte when it comes to Cuban food, but I always come away disappointed. The service and food quality is also very inconsistent. I can say that some of my meals here have actually been very good and they did get the rice right, but most of the time it is mediocre and the rice is completely off. One time we were seated and had to leave after waiting for 20 minutes when no one even came by to take our drink order.

I also made the mistake of coming here once on a Friday night. They had a live band going and we were seating right next to the band. It was extremely loud and we could not even hold a conversation. As other reviewers pointed out, you don't need a bunch of amplifiers and speakers for such a small space.

Ultimately this place down in South Florida would close pretty soon after it opened as it wouldn't even compare to some of the even more mediocre places. I am not expecting a Versailles or even La Carreta, but would love to see something on the level of a Latin America Cafeteria. Too bad this is not it. Ever since Carlos Cafe closed down, I have not been able to get a decent Cuban meal in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here twice. I want to talk about the second time.

We went on a Valentine's Day, and I had to go up to the bar to get my water refilled, since the waitress didn't refill it. The bartender just laughed at me as he refilled my glass. The hell? Who laughs at customers who need something? My husband noted that his meat was incredibly dry, and I had specifically asked for my order to be cooked a certain way, and brought it up with the waitress. This girl had a pretty huffy attitude, didn't even apologize and at one point even uttered an incredibly sarcastic, \"Awwww, really?\" Rude, rude, rude. Normally we get a flan when we go to a Cuban restaurant, but we didn't stick around for dessert this time, since we were pretty appalled by the service and the horrible quality of the food.

I would have hoped things have gotten better since our last visit, but from the looks of some of these reviews, they haven't. Piece of Havana? More like Piece of Shit!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch since it's close to work and have heard great things about this place.  I wasn't disappointed.  

I ended up ordering the roasted chicken based on the recommendations I read on here.  It was surprisingly crispy being that it's grilled.  The chicken was accompanied by mixed rice and beans as well as some green beans.  Everything was equally delicious.

The menu had a lot of items that had me salivating so that definitely means I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of all there was great atmosphere.  Live music was playing on the Friday evening that we dined.  There was also nothing to complain about the service, however, more importantly the food was very good.  Not only were the portions plentiful, but as someone familiar with Cuban cuisine, I can honestly say that everything here is authentic.  In our party we had a little of everything.  To start the Havana platter had a nice selection.  The empanadas were especially good.  The congri and roasted pork was a favorite.  We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We ordered the Red snapper and another sea food dish that showed two lobsters in the picture but it only came with one. They need to update the picture to only one lobster. We was expecting two lobsters since the dish was $30.00"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Don't get me wrong... place was beautiful and clean. I came in with a discount dining coupon. I was with my two kids both under 12. It happened to be kids eat free night and I ordered the items from the kids menu. My discount dining dollar value for a meal at up to $12. I ordered a meal for myself which was just under $17 and an additional meal for $12.95. A few minutes later the waiter came back and said I would not be able to order from the kids menu because I couldn't use a dining dollar discount certificate and get the kids meal free. I said OK I will order something else. I ordered a meal for $9.95 for the kids to share. I knew that once I presented my discount certificate that the service would be somewhat poor. The waiter never came to check on us. I had to call on another waiter to go and get him when my daughter needed to refill her drink. He never came and asked us if we need anything else. He never asked if we wanted desert or anything but showed up with a box and the check and proceeds to tell me that he only took off 9.95 and not the 12.00. Ridiculous. I tried to protest and he gave me a so sad too bad look. There are just way too many restaurants here in Charlotte for me to give them my business. The food was OK."}
{"text":"More like A Piece of Heaven!  The fried snapper was delicious.  It was fresh and filling, it comes with two sides: I recommend the plantains and yellow rice w/veggies.  You MUST top off your meal with a cup of their Cuban coffee...AMAZING!  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Friday. Place looked pretty busy. I ordered the pork sandwich with onions and French fries. Although the sandwich was skimpy, it had a good flavor, but I only found about two onion slices. It could've used some more juice on the bread.  The fries weren't crispy and had the sandwich had more pork on it, it might've been worth almost ten dollars. I'll give it another chance, tho. Overall, the sandwich was good and everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Urggghhh where do I begin. We made reservations for 8pm on a Friday which making reservations is a must especially on the weekends. We arrived on time and was seated right away. After we were seated we waited 20 minutes and no one had even came to our table to greet us. So my boyfriend got up and went to the hostess who came to our table to take our drink and appetizer order. Another 10 minutes past and a guy that seemed to be our waiter brings us our drinks and ask if we wanted appetizers to which we told him yes that we had already ordered them. Another 20 minutes later we received  our appetizers. A little crazy as we have now been there for over 40 minutes. We quickly ordered our entree when our \"waiter\" brought the appetizer because we didn't know when we would see him again. We waited another 20 minutes no food. The staff looked disorganized with their full attention on a large party celebrating a birthday. I needed some air so I walked outside and told my boyfriend if our food is not here in 10 minutes we are leaving. He talked with the \"waiter\" who went to get the food. Finally at last a Christmas miracle came and our food came over an hour after we arrived. By this point I was over it and over the lackluster food. Never again. If I was completely exhausted and hangry I would have spoken with the manager."}
{"text":"Great Cuban food and fast service. They are my go to place for Cuban food. Give it a try who knows that thus could be the best food to eat out at."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place but I've had mixed experiences there.  I went a few years ago for drinks and salsa dancing which was super fun.  We've tried to go back at least twice later in the night on a Saturday to dance again and for whatever strange reason either they were closed or did not have a DJ to do so.  

There is very little for a vegetarian to eat on the menu which was disappointing.  A coworker had lunch here recently and it took forever because she said the waiter totally forgot about her :/"}
{"text":"I don't know about food but the Mojitos and music are great! We def have a fun time every time we go!"}
{"text":"Poor service.there is a star because it wouldnt allow to post without it.but that star is not from me"}
{"text":"Amazing experience for my mom's birthday that coincides with Cinco De Mayo. Live band was absolutely amazing . I couldn't sit still in my sit. We danced the night away. The atmosphere was welcoming. Mojitos, so many flavors, yummy  food. Definitely coming back and definitely recommend.

Pro Tip: Every 3rd Friday there's live music and dance lessons ( Call ahead to double check)"}
{"text":"A Piece of Havanna... NOT the piece you want. 

1.) Service: TERRIBLE! We got there and it was not busy. It took our server (Juliette) 10 minutes to come and take our order for water. We ordered immediately so we wouldn't wait all night. 

2.) Food: The food was decent. I ordered a steak and my wife got the shrimp scampi. Everything had great flavor. My steak was overcooked for ordering a medium temperature. 

3.) Drinks: ALSO TERRIBLE! I ordered a raspberry mojito. If you like the taste of children's cough syrup, then this is the drink for you! On top of that delicious flavor, they will charge you $9. I recommend you go out and buy a mojito mix instead of wanting to have a terrible after taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ok, I've gone twice to this place. WILL not give it another opportunity. First time wife and I walked in and waited to be seated, and waited and waited.  Waiters passed us by and NOBODY greeted us or bothered to tell anyone that we were waiting to be seated. In fact, a guest there called what seemed to be the owner's son to seat us. At that moment again no greeting and only said...ILL BE RIGHT BACK.  This was about a 25min wait while standing in front of the hosts podium!  Wife and I walked out. It was then when a woman ran out the door to call us back. That moment we decided to leave because of the lack of professionalism. Ok. So I gave it another try. This time with some buddies and my 25year old nephew. Well dressed but wear a baseball cap. We walk in and he was immediately told he must take hat off to enter.  Of course he took it off and held it in his hand.  While seated he was asked to leave if he was going to hold the cap in his hand. Mind you, HE TOOK IT OFF HIS HEAD but apparently having it in his hand was a big enough offence that he was asked to leave if he continued to hold it in his hand.  In all. There will not be a strike three because I WILL NEVER RETURN to this OVERATED so called establishment."}
{"text":"ZERO stars. Can't say they don't try but the \"food\" is NOT Cuban, does not taste like any Cuban food this 50yr old Miami born Cuban-ish person has ever tasted or cooked. Makes me want to open my own place to show them how it's done. Not one to ever want to see a small business fail, but they need a new chef(s) to support their menu and their Cuban food claim. Really."}
{"text":"It's alright. 

I've been for lunch during the week a couple of times, since it's so close to work. The service is S-L-O-W, like, sloth on tranquilizers slow. Getting there, ordering, receiving food, and getting the checks is over an hour ordeal, and I don't know how many more times I can go here before I get called out on it...

Anyways, the food is usually pretty decent. I got the crispy shredded beef, and it was drenched in oil. Soaking. I don't know if anybody else has had this problem, but it definitely dissuades me from ever ordering this again. Flavors were altogether good on this though! The plantains were nice and crispy on the outside, but the yucca was seriously under seasoned. Just kinda a disappointing experience. Not enough to never make me come here again, but it's going to be low on the list of places I want to return to."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm giving them 5 stars if you love empanadas and mojitos, they have chicken, beef, and ham/cheese empanadas. Mojitos they have 13 options. I've never had bad service but I must admit I get empanadas, white rice, and black beans every time I come, come Friday night for a great live band."}
{"text":"OK for vegetarians as we have to survive off the side dishes. Great for non-veg folks, lot of options."}
{"text":"FIRST OFF, I AM CUBAN. How does one ruin a Miami Cuban  Sandwich?? It can be done. The bread was so hard I could barely chew it and had to discard part of it. I took half the sandwich home to give to the dog. The roast beef on the sandwich was tasteless, very small amount of ham, and the Swiss cheese was there, but heated away outside of the sandwich by their sandwich press. So much mayo it dripped out when trying to bite the hard bread. I NEVER had nor put mayo on any Cuban sandwich I made or got in Miami. I didn't taste any pickles on it, either. I would have sent the sandwich back but I was with my son. I won't go back. I can cook my own Cuban sandwich much better. It's a nice place, the employees, are very professional & friendly."}
{"text":"I am a Fort Lauderdale transplant that greatly misses diverse foods.  I was stoked to find this place.  I had the Palomilla Steak for lunch and was not disappointed.  The food was well prepared, the atmosphere was very comfortable, and the service was great.  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"First impression: The location is nice and had a great atmosphere. We were greeted immediately and given a table (not that they were busy). I enjoyed the decor but I will say that their leather chairs were a bit uncomfortable.

Nothing like Cuba Libre in DC (amazing decor!) but for NC it is a great ambiance. Now about their food...
  
*sigh*

What a disappointment when I drove almost 2 hours to eat here. I got here about an hour before closing and I guess that wasn't enough time since our waitress was rushing us to order. We came here to have this GRAND experience and left with nothing but a decent steak sandwich that I ordered after my disappointing meal (that she put TOGO without asking and I had every intention of eating it in the restaurant). My mother started off with a sangria which she gave it an \"OK\" it was on the sweeter side but still a decent sangria. Between my parents they split a Paella (which was huge) but they had no lobster! It also came with no sides and cost almost 30 dollars. The Paella was good but not the best, the rice was not fully cooked and the clams were closed shut! I on the other hand ordered their garlic shrimp with yellow rice and sweet plantains..... and I will never order that dish again... ever. I figured out their special sauce! The shrimp was overcooked and was chewy and the \"special\" sauce overpowered the dish.... all I can say is... Mojo Criollo anyone?? The yellow rice was cold and all I enjoyed was my sweet plantains. 

I will come back again with an ample amount of time and hopefully the food and service will be better. I love Cuban food and thats the only reason why I can't turn my back on this place just yet!"}
{"text":"I deem this place middle of the road.  Seating is comfortable and the noise level is low - good for a business lunch.  But the food is average at best.  Did not \"pop\" with flavor."}
{"text":"When I was feeding my car down by Carowinds Blvd, I used my new(er) BFF aka my droid phone Yelp app to locate a new place for lunch.  The truth is I've been condemned to un-cultured, un-worldly food for way too long.  I was determined to get some real taste back in my mouth before it goes on strike.

Who knows there's a cuban restaurant in the suburbs!  The location is obscure... a little strip mall off Tryon (right at Moss).  Something about Cuban/Latino music, it just brightens the day (and the place).  Ok, so the service was slow (no one sat me, but to their defense I was standing by the hostess stand looking at the menu, I think they thought I was a to-go customer).

Lunch menu (smaller portion) is only available during the week.  So I went after the sandwich (didn't feel like breaking my bank for a quick solo lunch).  Instead of the old standby Cuban sandwich, I tried the Miami Sandwich.  It's like a Cuban with with lettuce, tomato and mayo and ham croquettes.  I love croquettes.  I also orderd the soup of the day, Ajiaco Cubano.  

The soup was tasty.  Though it's very brothy (not as much as stew-y as it's described during my quick research online).  It definitely wasn't creamy like the waitress said.  But nonetheless it was good.  My cup ($2.95) had a piece of fatty pork and a little yuca in it.  

The sandwich ($8.95) itself was ok.  The pork was a little tough.  That's the disappointing part. (side note: best freaking Cuban sandwich EVER was the one I got in DC in the market... see my old review).  The bread was good, and the mayo/mustard added to the taste.  I definitely enjoyed the croquettes, which were being deliciously smushed by every bite I took.  The sandwich was big enough for me to save half for later.

I substituted fries with plantains maduros.  I'm a sucker for sweet plantains.  And they were good.  But is it possible to mess up sweet plantain?!

Overall it was an ok experience.  The waitress was nice, but I can see if it's busier (the place had 3 other tables at the most, virtually empty) the service would be slow.  The pork was the least impressive.  But I was happy, I was very very happy that I haven't lost my appreciation for REAL food :)"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that I'm giving this restaurant a bad review. We've been here a couple of times and our first visit was okay. Our second visit however, was absolutely terrible. We came with a group of friends before a church event. There were eight of us in when one of our group members went in to get a seat, the restaurant told us that they did not have space for us. At the time, the restaurant was completely empty and they continued to turn us away. Eventually, my friend had to beg to be able to eat there, and they allowed it as long as we promised to leave by 8 PM. 

The staff must have felt frustrated about having to serve us after claiming that they did not have space. The server was extremely rude and inattentive. She rolled her eyes several times and was extremely impatient. 

Several people in the group had made an order for chicken. While our food was being made, one of the servers came out to tell us that there was no chicken of that type yet and suggested that they replace it with a different kind of chicken. We agreed and that's what they served. However once we got our check, The three of us that had ordered the chicken found that we had been upcharged for the chicken breast. This was completely unacceptable, considering that the change made in the menu was made by the restaurant. And needless to say, the meal was sub-par as it could not be prepared in its original, authentic way. 

It took more than 30 minutes for us to get our meals. Overall it was such a disheartening and disappointing experience. We were there for the joy of authentic Cuban food and hospitable service, and we did not get either. To be completely honest this experience was enough to deter me from going back. I hope that The staff could be more mindful about the customers' needs."}
{"text":"I'm no chef Ramsey but disappointment from what I tried last night. I left the restaurant hungry. I really wanted to enjoy this experience but it was far from it. Waiter was slow. He was acting confused from the very beginning. I didn't understand that. I love when there is a language barrier because I feel like the food would be more authentic but not for this case. I ordered a Cuban sandwich. It was cold. The bread was dry and not even hot pressed. Ham was cold, mealy sliced tomatoes, mushy mess of ham croquettes, cheese had started to solidify. So opposite of what I was expecting. Also fries were soggy. I really wanted this place to be good because just moved from Wesley chapel and miss Bella Fresco Cafe and Gelateria in the Arboretum. Bella's I would have no problem recommending but not Piece of Havana."}
{"text":"Returning to A Piece of Havana to meet a friend for dinner, still an outstanding restaurant.

I opted for one of their skirt steak dinners, which arrived accompanied by a few plantains and two scoops of very tasty rice. Not a huge meal, but a decent portion. The steak was cooked perfectly, though the steak knife was appreciated. It was melt-in-your-mouth though not cut-with-a-fork. Great flavor with some spices but also the taste of the grill.

Service is excellent at keeping drinks refilled, clearing dirty dishes and generally staying on top of things without being annoying.

As we were leaving, the live music was getting set up. I understand that they also do some salsa dancing here. This place would be a perfect date night."}
{"text":"Not real cuban food. Over priced. Very over seasoned. And the black beans are from a can they just added seasoning and heat then up. I got Ropa Vieja. Shredded beef and it had extreme amounts of garlic/salt/ oil. They are famous cause they are so far from Miami. If you think this place is good, you haven't had cuban food before."}
{"text":"You won't think you are in Havana or even Little Havana, but it's not a bad place to grab lunch if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Friday night live music deserves 5 stars alone!! It's amazing! The band is incredible and will make you want to dance. The food is average. Not the best but the ambience and music makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant. Coming from Miami, the food was good.  The cafe con leche wasn't as sweet as I'm used to, but it was good!! The rice and beans tasted excellent. The servers are nice and it's great getting to speak Spanish with other people here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, I did not have a good experience here. Service was slow and the waitress was absent-minded. We went on a Saturday, and got there early enough that it wasn't yet crowded. 

But the food is what really disappointed us. My churrasco (skirt steak), came out very overcooked (I had asked for it medium-rare).  Not even a hint of pink in it. It had also been pounded with a meat tenderizer until it looked like a cube steak. I sent the steak back, and the next one came out a bit less overcooked, but still no where near medium-rare. 

My husband's picadillo was even more disgusting. The meat was ground so fine it was about the texture of canned cat food. It was covered in a gloppy tomato sauce. Normally a picadillo has things in it, like peppers and olives. None of that in this version, just meat ground to an unrecognizable pulp with tomato sauce.

Both entrees came with black beans and rice. The rice was mushy and completely unseasoned. The black beans were also woefully underseasoned. We had tostones with our meals instead of the standard maduros. The tostones were overly soft and very greasy.

I agree with previous reviewer would suggest Carlos Cafe in Rock Hill. The food is always well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The good is always tasty and the atmosphere is always fun! On Saturday nights they have live music and dancing... Great to participate in or just as background noise.

The BEST part is their mojitos! They're huge, strong and inexpensive! 

My only complaint is there's always a long wait."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place tonight. Being new to the area and craving Hispanic food I decided to give it a try. The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was worth it. They had a live performer singing. My food was so delicious with large portions. Def will come again"}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar at 1220... I am now leaving at 1247. I was never acknowledged. Watched as the bartender bussed tables. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Feels like I'm back in Miami. The vaca frita is THAT good! It's light and crispy, no greasiness. The empanada sampler is also tasty ... but filling. Could be a meal all on its own. Live conga band covering great music from the 80s tonight (friday). The location of this restaurant however isn't quite right; A Piece needs to relocate closer to Center City, maybe Elizabeth or Central Ave."}
{"text":"This is another place where I've been to a few times but have just gotten around to writing my first review.  First off, the service is great.  The servers are friendly and always willing to explain the menu if you have questions.  
For lunch, it gets a bit busy even when it's not full.  It's more of a sit down, and you may have to wait a bit.  But, things may have gotten better because dinnertime seemed to be almost quicker.  Maybe an extra chef?  Who knows.
The food itself is great.  The lunch specials are good deals, but even the dinners are reasonably priced.  You can substitute sides, but I usually go with yellow rice and black beans.  The maduros are good and not too sweet.  I had the gaunabana shake which was a bit different.  Probably won't get it again, but it wasn't terrible.
I'd definitely recommend this place to people who want something different, but it's a bit heavy so don't go if you are looking for something light."}
{"text":"Super tasty food. We all usually get the same thing each time. I get the pollo ala plancha. It's tangy thin chicken. Lish. Then I get white rice and black beans. Today I tried the beef empanadas with yellow rice and black beans. Awesome. My brother always gets the chicken sandwich and yucca. Service is a tad slow but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It was my second time here and it was so good! I had the breaded fish stuffed with shrimp and avocado and it's delicious!!!! Also the fried yuca as an appetizer tasted amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. First, make a reservation on the weekend or you'll have to wait in line. Second, make it around 7 pm, so you can hear the live music.  Get the fried plantains and avocado dip, and a mojito to get started. apps, music, mojito. Everything else is extra. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cuban food my husband and I have found north of Miami (we lived there for a number of years and moved up to the Carolinas about 8 years ago). Delicious mojitos and caipirinhas, the best yuca I've ever had (the recipe changes daily so you probably won't get the same one twice). The place is always packed so reservations are highly encouraged. Seriously go, you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I went to Charlotte with my family for New Years 2017. Wanted to eat and listen to Latin Music. This place had both. I didn't eat as I wasn't hungry. Family did and they seemed to have enjoyed their meals. I really enjoyed the music. It was a life band of about 4 members and these boys were jammin' ! The played Cuban and Latin Jazz tunes. They also played american classic instrumentals like \"Hotel California\" in Latin Jazz. Cool stuff. 

The ambiance was receptive and well dressed as some hung out at the bar as they listened to the music and had a drink, while others even danced. This is a place I'd go to again !"}
{"text":"Hit and miss, depending on how busy they are.  Sometimes they bring out bread, sometimes they don't.  The \"mariquitas\" appetizer is good; the \"Havana sampler\", not so much.  The vaca frita (crispy shredded beef) is good; the \"fried pork chunks\", not so much.  We've made reservations several times: sometimes they'll seat us right away, sometimes they'll try to put us at a two-seat table right in the middle of the dancefloor and the greeter will argue with us when we tell her we reserved a booth.  The live music on Friday nights can be pretty loud, if you want to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Piece of Havana, but was instead horribly disappointed. This place fell flat in every single way it could.

Let's start with the service.  It was severely lacking.  There was barely anyone (only 2 other tables) in the entire restaurant and it still took an obscenely long time to get anything, from our initial drink orders to refills to even our food.  If they were slammed I could understand, but the waitstaff spent most of the time chit chatting or watching one of the TV's mounted on the wall.

Now, the food.  I don't believe my standards are unrealistic.  There's plenty of good Cuban food to be found outside of Miami, all it takes is a little effort.  Also, it shouldn't be overpriced.  We're not talking foie gras or lobster here.  Sadly, this place suffered from both bad and expensive food.  

First of all, the Cuban salad was a joke.  It was the bare minimum needed to be considered a salad and clocked in at 8 dollars.  There wasn't even a dollar's worth of ingredients on the plate.  Then there was the Vaca Frita which should have been called Vaca Greasy.  It was served in a little bowl swimming in grease and fat.  There was nothing Frita about the dish with all the meat hanging limp and dripping oil.  The chimichurri sauce was equally greasy and unappealing.  I'm not even going to talk about the rice and beans (a staple dish of any Cuban restaurant).  Suffice it to say, I've had better at Taco Bell.

The one thing they did well where the Mariquitas and the avocado dip.  That's it.  The best part of the entire depressing meal was the appetizer.

This was a bad experience across the board.  I don't understand why such little effort was put into what could otherwise be a fantastic place.  The decor is great, they have a solid looking menu, and the right ambiance, but it fails at the very essentials of any restaurant, food and service."}
