{"text":"A small take out sushi place inside the food court of the Shoppes on the Parkway on Leslie and Highway connected to the Sheraton Parkway Hotel. We were hesitated but as a foodie we gave it a try and it wasn't disappointed. We ordered their deluxe chirashi don which have three XXL size of Argentina sweet shrimp, salmon sashimi, scallops, UNI, ikura and black tobiko. Everything was very fresh and the price ($13.99) was amazingly reasonable. You've got to give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! Good value for the money! Already been back twice in 5 days. There's Toro (tuna belly) in the sashimi party tray which tasted super delicious!!! MUST try!"}
{"text":"Great prices on delicious sushi! Ordered a 80 piece roll tray which came up to just under $51 after tax - very reasonable! The tray had great variety and not overly filled with rice. The fish was very fresh.  The reason why I'm knocking it down a star was because when I asked to pay with credit (since the machine was right in front of me) the lady behind the counter was like oh no. We only take cash because the prices are already so cheap. I would have understood if there was a discount with cash payment but I was still being charged regular price plus tax when paying with cash.   Despite the fact, I would like to go back and try the chirashi don! Looks so good!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with quality food and friendly service.   Firstly, this place is VALUE (price relative to quality and quantity).  We love to order the Combination meals because it comes with a Main (teriyaki meat or udon soup as examples), miso soup, salad, small noodle soup, rice, basket of tempura (2 shrimp + veggies), 3 california roll pieces and 3 nigiri.  The roll, I think it's called Lover's Roll?, is to die for. We really enjoyed this.  My only qualm the clumsy wording in their menu for Combination meals. It states that the combination meals come with soup, salad, and rice. However, when I ordered the combination with sushi and sashimi, it didn't come with rice... When asked about it, the waiter said that rice only comes with the teriyaki meals (surprising to me, because this meal came with quite a lot of sashimi to go with rice. Not a big deal, but something to note. We also ordered the udon noodle soup Combination, which came with a miso soup the first time we came, but the second time we came it didn't come with a soup... the server said that it's because the udon noodle soup is already soupy. Again, not a big deal, but they need to fix the wording in their menu because customers will be disappointed when they don't receive what is listed in the menu.  Anyway, the restaurant is great overall. Get a Combination meal and share a fancy roll and you'll be happy.  Lots of parking in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Ordered the 100 piece party platter for $60, and an extra black dragon roll for $12. This fed 5 people  (4 males + me). I was really satisfyingly full after the meal. The cuts are nice and big, and the quality is pretty good. Not high end quality, but decent for the price. I definitely think this is one of the better Take Out sushi options in the area, and I'm glad it opened as its a good option for a night-in. :)"}
{"text":"This sushi joint has only been open for 2 months and after reading all the great reviews I decided to give it a try.  We ordered the 40 piece maki tray for $25 and it was really good!  The rolls were made fresh to order and the ratio of rice to filling was perfect.  Everything tasted really good and the price is super reasonable. The workers there are very friendly.  This would be a great place to order those sushi party trays for your next event.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for decent sushi on the cheap, this place is a good place to fend off your sushi craving.  This place gets busy, so I suggest that you call ahead of time for your order.   We ordered a 60pcs tray with assorted sashimi, rolls, and sushi for $40 plus tax.   It came with assorted sushi (salmon, red tuna, tilapia, some pink fish, shrimp and crab), assorted sashimi (salmon, red tuna, tilapia, surf clam, raw shrimp (large) and another white fish and pink fish), and rolls (california, spicy tuna, avocado and salmon, and a spicy roll that included salmon, crab, avocado and cucumber).  We ordered 60pcs for two people and finished the tray. (I don't know how that happened). Maybe we were super hungry!   The pros is that the sushi taste good and the quality is def there and the price is right.  The cons is the fact that sometimes if you want more assortment in your rolls this place doesn't include them in the party trays. You will need to order individually."}
{"text":"Good price. Not so good quality.  My boyfriend and I excitedly ordered the medium sized assorted sushi, sashimi, and maki platter (40 pieces for $30) for dinner last week, hoping we had found a new hidden gem for sushi.. but we were fairly disappointed.   The maki rolls were fine but the sashimi wasn't fresh. It had a fishy odour to it and the texture was mushy (the underside of the surf clam was browning and the ??? fish that was seared at the edges tasted like it had gone bad). Nowadays with all the food safety concerns around raw fish and their potentially harmful bacteria/viruses, I think I'd rather pay a few more dollars for better quality sashimi that I can trust and eat without worrying."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise YuSushi takeaway!  'Yu\" certainly satisfied my family's craving for sushi and YuSushi took away our hunger. 'Yu' delivered quality, undeniably fresh and great tasting sushi for such an awesome price.   We ordered the AR02 party tray, which comes with salmon avocado rolls, California rolls, Spicy tuna rolls, Red Dragon, Rainbow Dragon and pop up roll?  The rolls were stuffed with a generous portion of salmon and had just the right amount of rice.   We've found ourselves a worthwhile sushi take out joint for our weekly sushi dinners.  We will definitely visit again very soon."}
{"text":"Ordered 60 and nice portion. Fish is fresh and little rice, will buy again. You need to go inside the mall to get to this place"}
{"text":"The sushi was quite inexpensive, as we got the 40 piece mixed sashimi, sushi and roll set for $25.  However I didn't feel as if the fish was that good.  I don't know if it's a question about the freshness or if the quality of the fish is just below my standard; either way it wasn't the best sushi I've had.    The lady was quite nice though, allowing us to substitute salmon and tuna for any sashimi we didn't like at no extra cost.   It is quite a hidden spot, tucked behind a food court that I never knew was there."}
{"text":"YuSushi,  discovered by chance on a  hunt.  Found it locally through yelp,  located at east beaver creek and highway7. This is the place for sushi. Trumps all you can eats and a la carts. Delicious and priced very fair for the quality put into maintaining quality. Friendly staff.  I've been ordering the $40 mixed platter which contains sushis,  maki and sashimis.  Try it and let me know if you love it like I do. If you don't like it, please tell me about it too as I'd like to know that too :) food court is full of whatever non sushi goers can ask for too."}
{"text":"Located inside the Shoppes of the Parkway (Sheraton Parkway plaza food court next to The Host indian cuisine). We ordered the AM03 $30 with 60 Pieces assorted, can't go wrong since we can try a bit of everything! Fish was fresh!fresh! At least they weren't served warm like some other takeout places, so the fish was still nice and firm(and cold) after we picked up our order. This place definitely does not cheap out, less rice, more fish, which is what all customers want! This will be my go-to place for sushi party trays since their prices are very reasonable and good quality fish."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch. Ordered the deluxe kaisendon. The selection of sashimi it come with was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tucked away inside the Sheraton Parkway food court this sushi take out place is a hidden gem.  Amazing prices for sushi so fresh.  It is now my go to place for take out sushi.  I wouldn't say it's authentic considering it's Chinese owned, but it tastes good enough for my palette.  They don't overstuff the rolls with rice which is what I like.  The filling inside the rolls is very generous.  Sashimi is so fresh!  Although it's a take out place, there is a relatively large seating area in the food court where you can order and dine there too.  I hope they can keep up the quality."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish! Awesome value for its party trays! I order from here at least once a week now. Their baby octopus is a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon for lunch. I was going to try the other place in the food court but it was closed and found this sushi place around the corner. Pricing was very attractive so I gave it a try. I ordered the Chirashi Don and a Spider roll. Presentation was good and the roll is well made. Service was good. Extra point for free green tea. The quality of the fish seems alittle overrated on yelp. The salmon was fresh, but the other fish was only so so. They are not bad enough to cause you a stomach ache but not as fresh as other authentic Japanese places. You don't see the nice layer of oil on the fish. Not sure if it's because they are not as busy on weekends and the fish don't move as fast as weekdays. Anyway, in my opinion it's just another average Chinese operated sushi plate. Great value for the price. Lots of seating and even underground parking. But if you are looking for high end fresh sushi, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My other half and I were trying to find a new place to try and happened to come across YuSushi and were quite intrigued with all the good reviews so we decided to pay a visit.  This place is located in the Shoppes of the Parkway - Connected and right beside Sheraton. This is not a full restaurant but actually located in the food court, and is a large food court stall. I know what you may be thinking, I was also skeptical as well to know that this was a food court stall, but based on the reviews and the pricing we decided to give it a shot. This same food court also has a number of other well reviewed establishments such as Bento Boy and Thai 5 cafe to name a few.   Whenever I try a new sushi place I always make sure to put in an order for Uni sushi. Uni is an acquired taste, and it is honestly very hard to find a place that serves it fresh and tasty. I have been to Japan twice, and I found only a handful of restaurants in Toronto that offer Uni as fresh as in Japan. Also Uni has a much shorter shelf life then, lets say salmon, hence a lot of \"lower\" end sushi places dont offer uni. So I was quite surprised to see a food court stall of all places offer Uni. I was expecting the uni to come out dark colored and sort of mushy (what I usually see in T&T), but if this place could pass the uni test, then it most definitely will make me a regular.   We also ordered a 40 piece sushi/sashimi/roll combo for $30. To give some perspective, my other half and I are regulars at another full sit down sushi restaurant, and a 40 piece platter there costs $53 + tax + tip which works out to close to $60. So YuSushi definitely has value, its pretty black and white there. But how was the taste?  I am happy to say that YuSushi was quite impressive! I would actually dare say that the sushi here can most definitely pass for sushi served at a full sit down restaurant, but for nearly half the price. I wouldnt go so far to say that this was the best sushi I have ever had, nor would this place come to mind as a recommendation for a night out given the fact that it is in a food court. But if you have a place to sit down and eat, or dont mind going home to eat this then this place is absolutely worth the trip dollar for dollar.   Also to note, when ever my other half and I go out to eat sushi and get a sushi platter we nearly always request NO WHITE TUNA - The reason being is because \"white tuna\" is not really tuna, but another fish called Escolar - Which in large quantities can cause indigestion. If your not aware of Escolar, I urge you to read up on it through Google. When we mentioned this request, our order taker mentioned that they actually do not serve white tuna but albacore tuna - The real tuna! This in itself earns this place a star.   Our platter included for sashimi - salmon, surf clam, lightly torched albacore tuna and another fish I cant recall at the moment. There was also 3 different types of rolls, and a large number and variety of sushi pieces which included red tuna. Pretty impressive for a food court sushi stall!  To also note though, since this is in a food court we did see a number of people just sitting down here and eating there. Also parking was very very easy to find here. Also from the moment we placed our order to getting it took probably no more then 10 to 15 minutes.   Speed, good price, good taste - Pretty tough to find any fault here!  All in all, this place is a really great deal. If your staying in, or want to impress a date with a romantic candle light dinner at home then I would absolutely recommend you come and get a take out order here."}
{"text":"My friend brought us to the food court where this Japanese take out restaurant located.  They have very decent price for the sushi, rolls, and sashimi.  We ordered 100 pieces tray and it didn't take long for them to deliver.  The rolls, sashimi and sushi all taste great.  Going forward we will be coming here for take out because of decent quality and match with great price."}
{"text":"This place specialty is take out sushi, as seating is pretty limited in the food court. The quality of the sushi was pretty good, especially considering the price. I absolutely love the selection and they do a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"I came across this place and have been back quite a few times since. This spot is hidden yet convenient--right at the corner of Hwy 7 and East Beaver Creek in Richmond Hill. What's even better is that it's right at the corner of my work place.  Prices are amazing and the quality is excellent. Please note that each pic was taken on a different day...yes, I love my California Rolls :p ...that tells you how much I love this place  Salmon carpaccio is very yummy Uni (Sea Urchin) - very fresh  Sushi platters are excellent--fresh, tasty, the rice is just right :)  4.5/5 stars-I'd for sure give it a 5/5 star but don't want to be biased"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday before 8pm so it wasn't busy and all the stores in the plaza were closed. So that made it super easy to find parking outside the main plaza doors.   Ordered Party platter AM02 (assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls - $30) is a pretty good value for the amount of pieces in the platter. Easily shareable.   From order to pick up it was all done in 11 minutes! Right beside the register counter, they have hot water dispenser and individual packages of green tea for those who would like a cup of hot tea (complimentary). The order (40 pieces) was enough for two people to be comfortingly full. The cuts of fish are generous and rolls are decently sized. I liked how their rolls doesn't have too much rice wrapped around it. A small suggestion would be the rice needs more seasoning!  This place hits the marks for quality and value. We will definitely come back and try their assorted rolls platter! Another 40 pieces.. maybe 60 or 80 pieces!? Yum! Solid sushi place with friendly service."}
{"text":"So good for eat in yusushi. The sashimi is freash. Working hrs is good for people to order."}
{"text":"Have been hearing a lot of good reviews about this place. Finally got to try it last weekend. Ordered the 40pcs assorted sashimi, sushi, and rolls tray for $30. The price was very reasonable for sushi takeouts. The sushi and sashimi pieces were generous but some of the pieces tasted kind of bland. Perhaps due to the quality of the fish. The rolls were delicious, I will definitely come back to try the assorted rolls tray."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. Everything is fresh and really reasonably priced. Definitely my new favourite."}
{"text":"Solid take out sushi tucked away in the upstairs food court! great prices for the platters.... cant go wrong with 40 pcs/$25"}
{"text":"Eventhough it located in a food court but the food and price is great. Best value ever. Strongly recommend the chirashi and deluxe chirashi. We were here 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check this place out due to the recent hype. It is located in the food court of \"Shoppes on Parkway\". This is a take-out sushi restaurant with plenty of seats in the seldomly-busy food court. We ordered a 40-piece assorted platter which was only $33 with tax included (for those that aren't familiar with the average cost of sushi in Toronto, this is a very reasonable price, which would explain the hype). However, paying the bill was ironically the best experience of my visit because that's where it started going downhill...  We waited for approximately 15 minutes and noticed that a few people had picked up their food even though they arrived after us. We figured that they probably made an order by phone, which is fair game. 5 minutes later, the cashier asked me and another group what our orders were. I thought to myself, \"the receipt with my name and order is right behind you...\", but whatever, there's no harm in re-confirming. Another 10 minute passes as I watched a few more groups pick up their orders while I stood there patiently. Once again, the cashier asked the other group and myself what our orders were... At this point, I started to get impatient. It's been 30 minutes since I placed my order and she was still asking me what my order was. I finally got my order after another 5 minutes.  Presentation and the quality of the rolls were actually quite decent, but the sashimi (with the exception of the salmon) was definitely not fresh and a bit on the warm side. However, I felt that it was still a great deal for the price. Up to this point,  I was still planning to give a 3-star due to its great price and above-average rolls. It was not until I spent about 20 minutes on the toilet with an upset stomach after my meal that I decided to drop another star.   Overall, I would recommend that you spend a few extra dollars for higher quality sushi elsewhere. You'll be grateful for the time and toilet paper saved! If you still decide to check this place out, make sure you call and make a phone order and take a nap before showing up."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi quality within Richmond Hill & Markham.  This place is a true hidden gem. Pure golden.  Do not be deceived by \"take out quality\". Come here and try out the freshness of this place! You will not be disappointed. Very delicious and great prices. The sweet bang for the buck.  I highly recommend anyone to come try out this place!"}
{"text":"YuSushi Takeaway is located inside the food court of The Shoppes of the Parkway.  If you looking for some reasonable sushi to satisfy your cravings, then maybe you will enjoy what YuSushi offers.  I had their sushi twice for lunch. The fish was decent but the shari rice lacked seasonings.   So I probably giving YuSushi a pass."}
{"text":"Although it isn't the best sushi around, they are definitely one of the best for it's price.  Ordered a 100 piece sushi tray for 60 dollars expecting it to come with only the common/basic sashimi such as salmon and white tuna. I was pleasantly surprised to find red tuna, squid, and other types of fish you don't always see for this price."}
{"text":"My new go-to sushi spot! Don't be fooled by the ghetto food court location they're in. Was really surprise that 40pc maki roll platter is only $25. The quality was fresh, prepared in 15 minutes and tasted great. Will be back to try other platters soon!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the (always) abandoned mall known as the Shoppes of the Parkway, adjacent to the Town of Richmond Hill building and across the street from the flourishing York Blvd restaurants, is this gem.   Where else can you find a 40 piece sushi tray for only $25? Such a steal! Quality is pretty decent too.   I just hope this place stays afloat, because the \"mall\" doesn't generate a lot of foot traffic."}
