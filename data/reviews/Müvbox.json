{"text":"And little box by the river serving delicious lobster rolls in the summer at a reasonable price.  Also does lobster pizza and a surprisingly good clan chowder.  Lobster was fresh and you are given a good sized portion of it."}
{"text":"What do you get when you cross an abandoned cargo shipping container and food truck? No not a cheesy joke, but the delicious and hip concept that is Muvbox!  This old port equivalent of a food truck embodies the essence of shipyard chic. Located in the old port conveniently right outside bota bota spa, it's the perfect snack to keep you energized for biking the port or walking old montreal (or powering through your bridal party photo sesh). 

The muvbox complex hosts both a taco box and a homard box (the montreal version of a lobster shack). I tried Taco Box and OMG- DUCK TACOS, best I've ever had! The duck confit was plentiful, succulent and perfectly complimented by the hoisin, shiitake mushrooms and shreds of seaweed salad.
My friends had the lobster taco and were equally enamored.   

I was in canard confit heaven! So much so, that the next day at my friend's bridal party photo shoot (which ended in old port) I tried to get us all to recharge at taco box just so I could have another taco- but sadly were pressed for time. [Insert sad face]

I had the horchata (a Mexican rice drink) which was delectably cinnamon-y and milky... Perfection! Wonderfully refreshing on a hot summer day. 

We had the chips and guacamole as well and while the guac was great, the chips had sesame seeds(?) which was different I guess, but didn't work for me. My friends got a cucumber lime juice which was a bit too sweet for our taste- definitely skip that."}
{"text":"J'y ai été en juillet 2014 et manger que la Guédille au Homard( le Lobster Roll) et c'était très bon et frais."}
{"text":"Ive heard about this place and seen it all over instagram... I was really excited to finally try it. When we got there I was really happy , the location is so nice right by the water and near the bota spa.. but honeslty for 11$ a lobster roll its really nothing special , they use a really cheap brand of bread. Also they could atleast butter the rolls or press them? And they sell bags of chips. I dont know about you but if your already serving homemade lobster rolls why dont you make your own fries? They have a wood oven to make pizzas and the couple beside me had it , it looked great. I guess I got a little disappointed because you kinda expect more than a bag of chips & cheap bread. By all means you dont want to serve homeade fries no problem but atleast be unique and make your own. The place really looks like a small box its really cool. It sucks when you have something going on with downgrading quality. I think the location really helps with the place.. otherwise good luck!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a \"snack\" while playing  tourist on a beautiful sunny day in the Old Port...and I was disappointed. For just over $15 after tax I expected more. The lobster isn't bad but it's a small portion served in what is basically a hot dog bun."}
{"text":"Pratique (en mode food truck au bord de l'eau), bien situé (dans le vieu port), ms un peu cher j'avoue (15$ pour un tout petit lobster roll..).. autant dire que généralement, on prend autre chose pour compléter.. il y a des formules avec soupe ou salade mais bon, ça ne \"cale\" pas tellement non plus...
Bref, c'est bon, c'est juste un peu cher selon moi..."}
{"text":"Premièrement, le lobster roll est pas vilain ! Délicieux, le chowder est encore meilleur ! Succulent ! J aurais 5 étoiles si la bière avait été plus froide !"}
{"text":"I have to admit, their lobster rolls are pretty darn good and also their clam chowder. The lobster rolls are served on a grilled bun which makes it really crispy. One bite, and you are in lobster heaven. Maybe I'm hyping it up, and that could be because I don't eat much lobster. But anyhow, I enjoyed the food. Oh and warning to people who think chips is fries, it's actually just Vickie's chips, not made by Muvbox or anything. 

My only main complaint is the price.But then again, this place is in the Old Port so rent is probably quite expensive."}
{"text":"Je serai bref : c'est beaucoup trop cher ! Je ne m'y ferai pas \"pincer\" deux fois. On avale de travers le sandwich de homard après avoir payé un prix exorbitant pour un petit roll bien ordinaire.

I will be brief: this is too much expensive! I will not pinch myself twice. It chokes the lobster sandwich after paying an exorbitant price for a very ordinary little roll."}
{"text":"My friend read about this place in the Foder's 2012 Montreal guide book. We stayed more on the northbound side of town near the museum district, so it was quite a track to get to Muvbox. The plus is that we rode bikes along the river and saw the zip lines and ropes course, which looked amazing. We then walked through old towne and back along the river again past the cruise ships and some cool 1970s housing on the other side of the river. So, when we finally arrived, expectations were very high, and my friend was starving. 

Since I'm a raw foods enthusiast, I had brought my own raw burger from Crudessence and was happy to sit and eat that while she had a lobster role. However, I know a thing or two about lobster rolls, and these looked average to say the least. So I didn't even have a bite when she offered it to me. So, she then became ill with what appeared to be a mild case of food poisoning. It took more than 2 days for the food poisoning to run its course. Otherwise, we ate vegetarian the whole time. If you are really \"into\" lobster, use yelp to find the best place. If you just happen to end up he, sure go ahead and eat the lobster roll. Since I am the first person to mention food poisoning, it may have been a one off or related to the Poutine that we are at another establishment. (However, I also ate the Poutine and didn't become sick).

Also, it's such a casual place that I did feel comfortable rating my own food that I had brought with me so that is a plus for this place."}
{"text":"I like the taste of their lobster roll, tastes great but its so expensive that I don't think I want to come back: for $15 you get some lobster with a lot of mayo stuffed inside hotdog buns. Not my idea of a good meal."}
{"text":"Le concept est génial, la vue est superbe et le lobster roll est excellent, de même que la chaudrée de palourde. Cependant, le spécial est un peu cher et ma copine est tombée sr un morceau d'écaille de homard dans sa pizza (qui a trop de sauce au vin pour qu'on goûte le homard)."}
{"text":"Lobster Roll implies it is served on a roll. Not a piece of white bread similar to Wonderbread. Respect the lobster. Respect yourself. 

Plus it is too pricey for what you're getting. Not into it."}
{"text":"Muvbox is a little restaurant inside a container located in old Montreal. It's such a fun concept and a great spot to grab a snack during your stroll in the old port.

There are two Muvboxes in old port. One is Porchetta, the other is the lobster roll stand (or lobster box!).

I've only tried their lobster roll so far and may go back for the other items on the menu.
The lobster roll is a bit pricy at $13.75 after tax (one star off for that!). They are quite generous with the lobster as you can bite into chucks of fresh lobster meat. But the size is so small that I would need 2 to make it a worthy meal...

The price value relationship definitely reminds me of the gourmet food trucks. :P"}
{"text":"Nice location, on the water, in a cool little box. Lobster is good but not out of this world or anything. The sandwich you get for $10 is tiny (understandably so, lobster is not cheap). Worth a trip for a snack but don't go here if you're hungry looking for a meal because you will end up spending a lot."}
{"text":"Heard of this place a lot and saw a lot of pictures Instagram, so figured I had to try it.
Wow what a waste of money.
Not tasty and incredible overpriced"}
{"text":"One of the fresh lobster role you can get in montreal. The place is located in the old port and hence the cool atmosphere. The roll is delicious and will definitely come again. The price may seem a bit higher $13.50 after tax. But I should say it is definitely worth it for the money."}
{"text":"Succulent Lobster roll mais cher ! Beau concept dans le Vieux-Port de Montréal, essayer le lobster roll, le classique du Müvbox. Mais pour 12,59$, je trouve cher pour un pain à hot-dog avec du homard."}
{"text":"I went to the small location near quaie Jacques-Cartier, where all the food trucks are.
I was so excited to try it but was very disappointed with the quality. Considering that all they serve are lobster rolls that cost nearly 20$ with taxes, I was expecting something great.
The lobster meat only consisted of claws. There were 3 claws in my roll. The lobster was very chewy to the point where I had to spit out one whole claw as it was impossible to chew. They obviously use pre cooked frozen meat, which I understand since lobster season is over, but the product should remain edible. I love love lobster and I was so looking forward to this... 
They do toast the bun... but even a good bun could not save it.
The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"To eat lobster, you'd think you'd have to fork up a fortune at a dressy restaurant, but that's not the case. Located in the Montreal's Old Port, Müvbox makes the best lobster rolls in town for only $10 or so. A bit more expensive than usual street food, but the location, the taste and quantity are well worth it. You can see the shape of lobster claws in the roll, and the ratio of lobster meat vs. mayo is perfect. Our neighbor raved about the pizza which I am looking forward to trying out soon."}
{"text":"Le concept du Muvbox est franchement sympa puisqu'il s'agit d'un ancien conteneur reconverti en \"food truck\" (non itinérant pour le coup) installé au vieux port environs 3-4mois sur l'année. A la carte, du homard! En soupe, sandwich ou pizza. 
Le lobster roll est juste délicieux...mais le prix est beaucoup trop élevé ! Payer 20$ pour un mini roll et un canada dry me paraît légèrement exagéré.
En soit l'expérience reste sympa mais nous sommes malgré tout reparti avec un goût un peu amère en bouche..."}
{"text":"Le roll était certes très bon, mais 21,21$ pour le trio avec Diète Coke, tasse de chowder (correct) et chips? La prime du buzz et du lieu est chère payée. Et le pain est un pain style Weston. Une chance que les chips étaient des Miss Vickie..."}
