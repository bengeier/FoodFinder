{"text":"I love this place!! Small menu but it gets the people in and out which is great! Food is great and cheap and the managers are funny and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I've loved Tenders in Huntersville, from whence PDQ was birthed, since the beginning (expect for that pork sandwich which is years removed from the menu). The food is excellent!  I've loved PDQ's Concord location since it opened, too. Until my last visit, that is (7.10.14). My family and I have eaten there often but this last trip was a disappointment. We were there around 12:30 pm and everything seemed normal--staffing, cleanliness, good customer traffic, ordering experience--until I picked up the tray for the four of us.   My chicken tenders (3pc. meal) appeared to be about 70% of the size I'm used to. Maybe that's imagination, maybe the H'ville location has me spoiled. Still, it's not what I remember from PDQ Concord. Chock that up to a subjective determination, but one that made an impression nonetheless.  What was objectively different from every past experience is the temperature of those tenders. Usually they are too hot to eat without some cool down. Not so this time. The flavor was right but smaller and just warm = no bueno.  And the fries were objectively unusual too. They were limp and a tad oily instead of their usual crispy. Luke warm, not hot. Very disappointing.  So, has People Dedicated to Quality moved to some \"make it ahead, hold it 'til it's dead\" production model? I don't know, and wouldn't think so. I'm thinking the \"Chef Coat\" who essentially signs off on every order wasn't doing the Quality Control part of his job very well that day.  That's enough of a review to make the point. No need to detail the experience of my wife and daughters beyond the common theme: This trip wasn't what we've come to expect from PDQ.   Obviously, as I'm writing this review a week later, our sub-par experience made an impact. In hindsight, I should have cared enough to speak to one of the chef coats. My bad--I'll do better if it happens again. My hope is that it was just an off day and not a sign of problems leading to decline. We'll see soon enough. I want PDQ to thrive. When it's done right it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The best chicken Cesar salad around. Make sure you get the dressing mixed in. It is on particular with expenses restaurants. Fast service too."}
{"text":"Very good...didn't even miss Chick-Fil-A being closed today. The sandwiches and tenders were fresh and hot, the dipping sauces delicious and the staff very friendly and accomodating. No complaints."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken salad and indulged in fries. The salad was fresh and the vinaigrette flavorful. The honey mustard and creamy garlic was used for my fries and it was soooo good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Have been there on at least three or four occasions and find the food to be at best okay. I have tried the grilled chicken tenders and the grilled chicken sandwich, and did not finish either.   The salads on the other hand are really good until you put chicken on them, there chicken just does not measure up to the other places around like Zaxby's and a few others, Just tasteless.  On one visit I found the food to be so distasteful that I complained to the manager, he gave me for free dinner passes that I do not plan to use."}
{"text":"Food was good but service is slipping. I ordered 3 chicken tenders only with the garlic sauce. I received the chicken tenders, but not the sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch before doing some shopping at the Mills. The service was fast...tenders crispy...tea sweet. Loved the creamy garlic and sweet heat sauce. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good fries, but the sandwiches are alright, I would rather have Chick-Fil-A.  Also, way overpriced!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this restaurant and decided today was the day.  My husband and I both ordered the crispy chicken salad.  For the price it was definitely not worth it!  The salads are not very big and there was not a lot of chicken on it.  I could tell that the chicken was fresh but it lacked seasoning.  Unfortunately I decided to try the ranch and that was awful!  I've had better quality Ranch out of a bottle but my husband ordered his with the honey mustard and really enjoyed that sauce.  Overall, I doubt I will be a repeat customer, but I can say that the customer service was a positive experience."}
{"text":"Their chicken salad with the blueberry vinaigrette is EVERYTHING!!!! Very healthy and easy to log on MyFitnessPal for those tracking their calories and macros."}
{"text":"Great chicken for a great price. Staff is super polite and efficient. Wish there were more of these around the charlotte area."}
{"text":"Tenders are fabulous, fries are Great, love the Green tea. One of my favorites. Fast service and frendly staff"}
{"text":"Excellent Service! Rarely do I have a memorable experience grabbing something quick and going through the drivethru but Eden was inviting and very friendly. I apologize for not recalling his name but the gentleman at the second window was awesome too.  Tenders were fresh and the bleu cheese sauce was on point. Tried the blueberry coleslaw which was awesome and refreshing on a hot day.  Definitely have a limited menu but as they say, it's better to be the ace of one rather than the jack of all.  Good job PDQ, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food.  My first time trying.  Got three tender meal with buffalo blue cheese sauce.... Yummy!  Fries are homemade and are delicious.  Only reason for 4 stars is that my meal was $8.  That's a little over $1 more than what you would pay at chickfila.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent, sadly because it can be pretty good, but on almost every visit, some part of the order is very old, barely warm.   On almost every visit have to hunt for clean table, but almost never see tables or floor being cleaned. No customer contact from staff, they just stand behind counter and call out orders."}
{"text":"Ok so maybe I'm being harsh on my complaints but I had 2. #1....fries...they were good but not memorable...kinda like 5 guys fries just mcdonalds size...#2 sauce....they r great...amazing...full of flavor!!!! Well from the one sauce I got in a communion cup that if I dipped my pinky finger in to sample that would be all I had. SHARE THE SAUCE!!! THEY R VERY TASTY!!! Now....dinning area at lunch mind u was spotless...food was fast and staff was amazingly friendly!!! Congrats pdq that's hard to accomplish! Chicken well is chicken but it's done very well and if every time I go I just have to ask for extra sauces then so be it! Great place for a QUICK QUALITY sit eat and run lunch. Way to go PDQ!!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD Waay better than expected.  This is real food from what I expected to be a fast food joint.  We'll be back. SERVICE We've only done the drive thru, but it has been very quick every single time.  Staff is friendly and knows their stuff. VALUE Great value.    BOTTOM LINE If you want real food real quick - this is your spot!"}
{"text":"They have the freshest salads to be considered within the fast food arena. My favorite is chicken salad add candied almonds and craisins.  And oh boy, those fries will get you in trouble - delicious."}
{"text":"Average food served in a nice environment. Fast service and very clean. The quality of the food is good as well. However, The food is overpriced and for the most part, quite bland.  The best food here that I've had were chicken tenders with one of their very good sauces, but I'd much rather go to Wendy's, Chick-fil-a, or Zaxby's for less money. I live two minutes away and will drive right past it every time. If they improved their food or lowered their prices, I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"Great easy lunch. Nice to find something different in a fast food chain. Service was great. Tea was perfect, blueberry salad and turkey sandwich were great. Management had everything under control during a packed lunch"}
{"text":"I have eaten here two different times now and food was great. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich with fries.. Both delicious!! The second time I ordered the tenders and fry's, once again both great. There homemade dipping sauces are what makes this place even better. I tried a milkshake the second time which was good, but I have had better. I will come here again soon."}
{"text":"I have a hard time being a critic to this place. It is really good clean place to eat. Here are so pros and cons.  Pros + Food comes out fast + Sometimes announcers are funny when announcing your name to get your food + They have 2 of those coke machines with a bunch of flavors!! + Super clean + Food tastes great! + Awesome sauces + Sports on all tv!!!  Cons - When there is no school, this place is super busy, omg - No beer...lol  I recommend eating here. A great place for fast good food!"}
{"text":"I just love PDQ. We do not live remotely close by, but I will make up any excuse to be close enough to stop in.  Chicken is awesome. Salads are fresh and tasty. Fries are fresh cut (as all fries should be).  The sauces are just incredible. The honey mustard is the best anywhere and I crave the creamy garlic.   Great service and the place is always very clean.  The only thing I'm on the fence about with this location is that the fries are not consistent. One visit they are over cooked, the next they are undercooked. Sometimes they are just right and when they are, they are the best anywhere!  Tenders (in Mooresville), the flagship of this chain, gets the fries right every single time, so I know it's possible. There is a definite flaw somewhere in the process here and that's the only reason for four vs, five stars."}
{"text":"Eaten here at least 3 times, but sorry, I just don't think the chicken is that good.  It's too tough.  once bit into some grissel in a chicken sandwich.  Fries are too skinny and greasy.  For the price, you don't get much.  I don't hold out much hope for this place considering there is a Chick-Fil-A and a KFC just down the road that consistently serve excellent chicken meals for good prices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. Like the original store \"Tenders\" in Huntersville, they almost exclusively deal in one thing, delicious, fresh, hand-breaded chicken. The standard 3-Tender, Fries and a Drink is my usual choice. The chicken is juicy, lightly breaded, and can be accompanied by one of half a dozen delicious sauces. I recommend the sweet sriracha sauce! The fries are equally great, cut fresh everyday, perfectly seasoned. Try one of their fresh baked chocolate chip cookies while your at it."}
{"text":"We live about a mile from this PDQ at Concord mills......lucky! Why are we  lucky to have yet, another chicken tender joint you ask? The answer is in the ingredients. PDQ uses the same ingredients that I would use at home. They make everything fresh...everything. When you go thru the drive-thru you can see the youngsters pressing out fries on a medieval looking gadget. Salads and sandwiches are on the menu as well. I have yet to try a sandwich but I have eaten the chicken caesar salad with grilled chicken.....huge and delicious! Do yourself a favor and finish off with a shake, nothing short of great. This place is sure to be a hit with this area, I know it is with my family. Bottom line....while you are out braving the mall, stop in and fill up on the goodness that is PDQ."}
{"text":"This has to be my only 5 star review of a \"fast food\" place.  Its just higher quality food.  I normally opt for a chicken tender salad as I do feel a little guilty about always ordering fried food when here.  The salad greens are fresh.  The tenders are just amazing.  The honey mustard dressing even seems better than any other fast food place.  For under $7, its just a great deal I can't pass up if I'm around one of these places.  Bottom line is, they've set a new bar in self service quick dining."}
{"text":"Fast food poultry at it's finest. This small chain dots the Carolina's and is a welcome change from the usual golden arches. They only offer chicken and turkey but everything I've had has been very good. Their homemade sauces are delicious and so are their teas. I've had their salads, their tenders and their turkey and cranberry sandwich. I would highly recommend all of them."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and her kids for a quick dinner. It was the first time for all of us and right away I was impressed with the hand washing station in the front.   This was a huge win for us to get the kids and ourselves clean hands and ready for dinner.   The staff were all very kind. They explained the menu options and made a few suggestions and I decided to go with the tenders, fries and a chocolate milkshake.   The tenders were good. They came with just the right amount of breading and seasoning. And yes like other reviews have mentioned it's the real deal chicken meat. I also liked the huge variety of dipping sauces were also a nice treat. I tried the garlic, sriracha, ranch and honey mustard.  My favorite hands down was the garlic but they all had really good flavor.   The fries were a huge let down. They weren't hot or crispy and they didn't taste like there was any seasoning on them. Meh. My friend ordered the fried zucchini and those were much tastier. I'd recommend trying those over the fries!   The milkshake was just alright. I would have liked a bit more chocolate flavor and for the consistency to have been a little bit thicker.   Overall, it was a solid visit. I think it's a bit pricey for what you get but I'd be willing to give them a try again. Right now for me this place is just 3 stars."}
{"text":"Fries were good, sauces were great, nuggets were not. Really spongy/slimy consistency, made me lose my appetite. Can't speak for the rest of the food but don't get the nuggets."}
{"text":"Shocked at how good it was... Decided to try something new, had the crispy chicken sandwich and fries and also a chicken strip order.   Sauce: chipotle BBQ - very good, definitely get again.   The chicken was extremely moist, perfectly crispy.   They put 4 pickles on the sandwich, equally distributed ... Amazing. Love pickles and loved the attention to detail here. The pickles were also thicker than your standard fast food pickle.   The bun was great, an egg bun?? No clue what makes it different but it was delicious.   Fries: loved the shoe string type fries (not normally a fan, but it was a nice change from a standard fry, not as filling).   As a chick fil a die hard, I will go out on a limb and say that pdq could put chick fil a out of business if they wanted to. It was really that good."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place was better before.  The chicken was fresh and hot, but the bbq bacon ranch sandwich had waaay to much sauce slathered on both sides of the bun - makes the bun soggy and gross, couldn't eat half the bun.  Got the crispy chicken salad and the chicken was good, but at about $7.95 it was really on the small side and needed a few more ingredients.  Not worth the cost.  And the fries just aren't as good as they used to be.  Bottom line - Yes to the chicken, eh to everything else."}
{"text":"Very fast, friendly service!! The food is a bit pricier than say Chick-fil-A, but it's delicious! The chicken nuggets are undoubtably fresh. They make their sauces daily, which is a plus. Overall, a great place for some good chicken!"}
{"text":"Food is so-so. Fries are pretty good.  I like the fact it's so clean and staff seems nice.  They did forget to put my side with my meal so had to go back up."}
{"text":"I watched as this place was being built and thought \"Great another fast food joint\". WOW!!! Was I surprised!   While I guess it could be considered 'fast food', it definitely is not your typical fast food joint. Since my very first visit I have been extremely impressed with the level of service, more than adequate staffing, attention to detail and superior quality of the food.  The chicken at PDQ is some of, if not the best chicken I have ever had. The fries are awesome too. Though they are great tasting with the seasoning, I eat them plain (blood pressure). They are great either way. Oh... you have to try the lemonade! It can be a bit tart, but it is so good.  Oh yeah... the sauces. Try them all. My favorite is the sweet heat. Its fantastic.  One last thing about this place. They are community oriented. Need help raising funds to support a cause? They have you covered. Get with them and they will help set up your fundraiser. Essentially, you plan your event at the restaurant and a percentage (10% I believe) of the sales during your event go to your cause. That's awesome!    Next time you're in Concord, you have to try PDQ. I think you'll be glad you did. Let me know what you think.  PDQ = People Dedicated to Quality...  It shows!"}
{"text":"I love PDQ it's delicious I love that they have fresh lemons for their Tea ! The food is always fresh and the service is always fast! This is by far the best fast food around even my kids like it"}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since I went to PDQ. When I lived in Raleigh, there was one near my house, so it was rather convenient to go to.  While in Concord the other day, I wanted lunch. This was around 1:30 PM. Chic-fil-A was packed (as usual). On my drive back home, I decided on PDQ. There wasn't a huge line at the drive-through, so I figured I'd be OK. PDQ's way of ordering is very personable. I like that. While it did take some time to get to the order taker, the wait for my food was pretty long. Probably about five minutes. I ordered the BBQ bacon ranch sandwich & zucchini fries. There was no reason given for the long wait. All in all, this visit probably was about 15 minutes.   My food was good; however, the bacon could have been cooked a bit longer. The zucchini fries were amazing!  I do love that there are more menu options that what they used to have.  They are a bit pricey, but the portions are plentiful.  There is good parking, but I can imagine it gets pretty packed around lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. They are better than chick fil a in my opinion. Their sauces are so good (try the honey mustard) and their fries are fantastic. I always get the green tea and the cookies aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Review 2: oct 1, 2015. went for dinner.  Ordered grilled chicken salad with blueberry dressing.  Good as usual but again... Fries were nasty. Why? Can someone please explain despite of your fresh fries making process ( operating manager of pdq called it) is not working? Nasty.  Why? I saw one customer asking for fresh ones so they had to make a new batch. I really think they are mixing new ones with stale ones.  Please fit it.       Review 1: I gave 4 stars because 1 out of 5 times they get my order wrong.  Wrong salad dressing or missing something like dipping sauce, etc.  I am not sure what it is they are 2 percent short from being 5 star.    Fries are normally good.  Again there is about 20 percent chance that it may not be fresh.    Overall they keep the restaurant clean and friendly staff. Most of them are teenagers.    Love grilled chicken salad with blue berry dressing."}
{"text":"Best new fast food concept and it started in the LKN area.  The tenders are great, milkshakes are very good as well.  The new layout is great.  I have also visited the Raleigh location and seems to be very consistent customer service across all the board, excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place despite the limited menu offerings.  In fact, that might be one of the secrets to #PDQ's success - they do a few things extremely well, as they only offer tenders, sandwiches and salads.  Their chicken tenders are simply amazing!!  I usually get the \"3 Fresh Tenders Meal\" with fries and honey mustard.  Their tenders are just that - extremely tender; not soggy, but not hard and over cooked either.  They are crispy on the outside but warm and tender on the inside.  I love them!  I also want to mention their sauces.  I've tried both the honey mustard and ranch at PDQ and both are legit.  They are bursting with flavor and taste fresh, almost like they are made in house, maybe they are!?!  I usually don't comment on the drink options available at most establishments, as they are usually your standard Coke or Pepsi products, sweet tea and/or lemonade.  However, I'd like to mention that PDQ offers this Coca-Cola freestyle self-serve thingy, in which you can mix and match over 100 different flavors of  Coke products.  Its pretty cool if you've never tried it and is sure to be a hit with most kids.   The only reason I am not giving this place five stars is because I've had a chance to try the grilled chicken sandwich (on an egg/white bun).  It was good, not great.  Too plain, too simple, not much creativity or originality, but STILL tasty.  Other than the chicken sandwich, this place is a most try if you love chicken tenders and are in the Concord Mills area."}
{"text":"I had extremely high hopes for two reasons. The appearance of the restaurant from the modern clean look on the inside to the modern casual interior. Second reason is from the glowing yell reviews. So here's my breakdown.    1.  Kinda pricy in comparison to the same concept stores  2. Loved the dining room hand sink. Automatically disarms the battles I have to have with my kids on washing their hands.   3. Loved the exterior and interior of the restaurant.   4. More than enough staff walking around. Some seemed glad to be there and the others preferred to be elsewhere.   5. The chicken tenders were little larger than zaxbys and about the same size as chick fil a. Very bland. Barely a hint of seasoning. Not sure if that's standard or we just got the bottom of the flour dredge.   6. For the price of $9.79 for a 5 PC chicken tender basket you'd expect a few more fries than the minuscule amount. Potatoes are cheap. Low food cost and boosts value and basket presentation. Fries were much better than the tenders. Seasoned well with salt and done to perfection as a homemade fry.   7. We tried the buffalo blue, honey mustard and Bleu cheese sauces for our tenders.   -buffalo Bleu was sweeter than store shelf Catalina or French dressing. No hint of heat for the buffalo side or know tangy Bleu cheese profile for that half. Almost was like a cole slaw dressing with a hint of spice and paprika for color   -honey mustard was the best of the three. Perfect ratio of mustard/mayo/honey  -Bleu cheese dressing had to chunks of Bleu cheese and no profile that you'd expect from that flavor sauce. Id compare it to the milk toast version of ranch. Tame and lame.   8.  Now I'm half Irish and half redneck and southern by the Grace of God. I've traveled extensively through the south with my career as a chef and also as a former restauranteur. With that said. I know my Sweet Tea. From God's pitcher to my lips. There is an unwritten standard in the southern restaurant world from this amber brown nectar. My first swig of pdq sweet tea was ghastly. You'd expect the first overtones to be the sugar finished by the mellowness of orange pekoe. Not this time. It was sour. Sour from sitting too long. Sour from trying to save a penny on a slow segment of the dinner shift. So I went with the ol coca cola backup which I hate to do. I politely notified the young counter girl that they may wanna check the tea out. I understood that they'd be closing in an hour or so and they probably didn't want to waste 2-2.5 gallons of tea making it this late. She tried to offer up an explanation of how maybe the green tea got mixed in or switched. I politely let her know that I know when tea is sour. I also tried to explain that restaurant brewed tea only has a shelf life of a couple of hours in the window with sun beating down on it. I wasn't looking for anything. I just wanted to prevent another customer getting an icy glass of this swill and possibly getting sick from it. She notified a manager and he went and tasted and I guess it was ok with him. For my sanity I had everyone in my party go by and try it, and they had not been privy that I thought it was sour. Needless to say they all spit it out and confirmed the sour taste. No big deal but thought id include it in this review."}
{"text":"I stopped here for the first time today. The place is very clean and the staff was very friendly. I had a 3 piece tenders meal to go with fries. The fries were AWESOME! The tenders were really good too but I was a little disappointed because they forgot to give me my sauce and I didn't check before I left. The tenders were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked though. I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Tried the Crispy Turkey Sandwich with Sweet Heat sauce, Awesome!!!The Granny Smith apples with Toffee Dip is addicting."}
{"text":"After riding past PDQ so many times, I was finally able to visit this restaurant. Simply put, it was amazing, mainly because of the service. The food was amazing too though. I ordered chicken strips, and while they were a bit pricey, I enjoyed them. I wish I would have gotten more fries with my order, and believe I should have gotten more. However, the food was great nonetheless. Employees working at this location were great. That is probably the only word I can sum them up as. They were so friendly and helpful, and made me extremely glad I finally visited this restaurant. I cannot wait to go back. I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can probably do my review simply on the apple's and toffee dip alone as I come here frequently for the toffee dip only....I am completely addicted to it, I may get 5 to 10 mini cups a week and just grab a bag of apples from the grocery store.  If you haven't tried the dip, you're really missing out on the best menu item in my opinion.  Sure I love the zucchini fries, the tenders are pretty good, and the creamy garlic sauce is probably my fav, but the toffee dip gives me life!  Give it a try..."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. The salad is fresh made, large and delicious. The fries are wonderful. The service is great everything is first class. I like eating here."}
{"text":"I must say I can't wait to go back.. starving and didn't just want to eat anything. I notice a review from my follow Elite Debra.. she mentioned how she loves the Club Cali.. grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, bacon and a big chunk of lettuce. So this sound good. Why not since I'm in the area. I pulled to the menu screen expect to order there. Well no. You pull up a little farther to talk to an actual human being. I was shocked.. I then placed my order. Pick up my food at the next window.  Boy, the sandwich is good. The fries is a meh. I have had better. But the sandwich is not heavy. Chicken is well season. The avocado is fresh, lettuce is plentiful and the packaging is awesome. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"PDQ:   Pennies, Dimes, Quarters - make sure you have enough when you visit.  Food value not the best:  meals are good, but not worth the high price charged. On other hand, had a group gathering here - worked out great.  They have a separate, slightly quieter sun room that was perfect for a large group.  GREAT staff - very personable, accommodating, and fun.   Now the milkshakes:  yum!   The good thing is, if you hit a Kannapolis Intimidators game right, you'll get a free milkshake at PDQ, so keep that in mind during summer months and check your ticket stub.  Clean and fast.   Glad you're in Concord, PDQ!"}
{"text":"***Update***   Since my review numerous employees of PDQ have reached out to me and rectified the situation.  They truly are dedicated to quality without a doubt.  I've been back a few times already and they have knocked it out of the park every time.  ***Original review*** Normally I have a great experience at PDQ Concord; however, they need to take a look at their quality a little more.  I ordered a sandwich w/ zucchini fries tonight.  Sandwich was great as usual, sadly there was only 10 fries and the rest was bits and chunks of fried batter."}
{"text":"I had the 3 tender meal with zucchini fries, I have never had such amazing thick plump fresh chicken ever before! The honey mustard sauce was super and they are generous if you want more. The zucchini fries were better than any French fries I have had.  They were so flavorful that I didn't even dip them in the honey mustard or ketchup. Service was very quick.  Lots of cute men here too!!!!"}
{"text":"PDQ in Concord, NC is a new and rapidly growing restaurant chain based off of a local gem in Cornelius, NC called \"Tenders Fresh Food.\" Like the original, the food is phenomenal. PDQ does food the right way, you can immediately tell the quality from the first bite. The texture is splendid and the flavor of the fresh chicken to the daily homemade sauces is out of this world. It is truly amazing being able to watch this business take off right in my backyard and I wish them the best of luck!  For those who have never been, PDQ (And \"Tenders\" for that matter) does chicken, and that's about it. They do have one crispy turkey sandwich but the headliner here is the chicken. I still remember my first bite into chicken tenders from PDQ about a year and a half ago, all that I could think of was \"WOW.\" You will have to try it for yourself. Their combos typically come with french fries that alone are worth a 20 mile trip to get.  The restaurant itself has a very modern and inviting feel to it. It can get a little loud inside but the buzz is all part of the PDQ vibe: Lively & Fun! In the dining area you will find a new Coke Freestyle machine that allows you to customize your drink to your liking. You like Grape Sprite? No Problem! Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper? They got it! My absolute favorite part of the building itself is a first for me in a restaurant: a hand washing station conveniently between the ordering station and drinks. It's great for when you don't need to use the restroom facilities (because who likes touching that dreaded restroom door handle) but still need clean hands. It struck me as a thoughtful yet common sense addition to any restaurant. Bravo PDQ!  If you take anything from this, remember this: Your visit to PDQ will be a unique experience. Superior Fresh food with fast and friendly service. See for yourself why PDQ has everything it takes to be a legendary restaurant!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place just driving beside Concord Mills and originally thought it was a Mini-storage. When I walked in I wasn't exactly sure of where to go. There is a lot of open space and the store is very clean.  There's a hand sink in the dining room for you wash and sanitize you hands.   The menu is relatively small and features a couple of forms of chicken strips and sandwiches. What I was taken back by was the fact that they had a turkey option for every chicken entree.   On this particular trip I ordered the fried turkey sandwich. It was crispy, juicy, and very well worth the relatively high price. Although there were some earthy undertones that I really wasn't a fan of. I got fries for my side and they loaded my box with fries almost past the point of five guys. They fries were seasoned to perfection and the perfect mix of soft and crunchy. I also got a side of blueberry slaw, which was just OK and really didn't need the blueberries.   Over all this place is worth a try for lunch or quick fly by dinner. You should difinitely try it at least once."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. Staff are very friendly. I always order the same thing but everything looks delicious.  The chicken is cooked fresh. They have great shake specials as well."}
{"text":"Way overrated. Great staff considering they have twice the available staff of any similar restaurant. So, no surprise everyone is able to dote and spend time with each customer. The food is ok at best. Over seasoned and took too long considering we are talking about burgers and fries. Not enough healthy food choices. Bathrooms and overall restaurant were generally clean.  Dollar for dollar I will not be back after my two visits."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  Their crispy turkey sandwich is delicious - when it's fresh (which is most of the time)...but I ate there tonight and the turkey was hardly warm and chewy and the bottom portion of the brioche bun was either very stale or very toasted.  I've eaten at this location about 10 times over the course of the past three years and have only had one major issue...aside from the milkshake that I ordered being made incorrectly, and being provided a refund by the manager, they failed to provide a receipt or even the proper change. He just handed me random money that was about 75¢ short of what I had paid.  I figured I should add, again, that their food is delicious most of the time.   So, like I said, it's hit or miss. It's definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I've given it several chances, but it just isn't worth it.  There is absolutely nothing for vegetarians on the menu.  How hard is it to make a grilled cheese?? I asked at the register and made a suggestion to a staff member who asked if there was anything about our experience that could be improved.  Both literally shrugged and me and offered no \"sorry\" or \"I'll mention it to management\".  I can pay a lot less for a bland salad elsewhere.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Mediocre food served in a more family-friendly environment. I decided to try a full meal from PDQ after enjoying one of their chicken tenders at the Yelp SEAlife event.  I had no idea where this place was in relation to the Mills, so I did drive around a little bit before finally finding it (thanks to my GPS app). It's right across the Academy store, if you happen to know the layout of the area better than myself.  I walked in and was surprised at how spacious it was. It was pretty packed in the seating area but there was no line. I walked right up and ordered a chicken tenders salad and beverage. Total cost of my meal came right under $8. The beverages are self-serve. They have the ubiquitous coca cola machine but I went the half unsweet/half sweet tea combo. Unfortunately, I was very dissatisfied with the taste of their tea and regretted my beverage choice.  They call out your order via microphone so be sure you're paying attention while deciding which coca cola combination you want to fill your cup with. I wasn't blown away by my salad. It was just OK.  I plan on going back to try their chicken tenders meal (although my friend who I went with stated those were just ok as well) but I would recommend PDQ as a better alternative than what's found in the mall food court."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped here for a quick bite and we were very impressed with the speed and friendliness of the service. The interior was also very clean and well-kept.  I ordered the kid's meal chicken tenders meal while my sister ordered the grilled chicken salad. PRO TIP: get the kid's meal if you want some tenders! It will fill you up well and is so much cheaper.  My sister said the salad was decent quality. However, we both agreed that the chicken was fantastic! Try the sauces too; they're homemade and are all delicious. We also got the coffee cookie crunch seasonal shake, which was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The food is only average and the dining room is always loud when I've visited. Not appealing for the price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Very friendly staff. The food is so fresh. Best tenders I've had. The lemonade is also good and sweet."}
{"text":"I visited this location on 7/27/17 on the recommendation of an associate.  I was please with my tenders.  It just happened to be the BOGO event.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely recommend PDQ."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! It is SO good. Such a cool concept. They only serve poultry, but unlike another chicken only fast food place, they have turkey too. All fresh, nothing frozen. Great family restaurant. Fast food but tastes nothing like fast food. Everything is made to order. The employees are super friendly. If it's raining they'll even offer to walk you to your car with a huge PDQ umbrella. PDQ stands for People Dedicated to Quality and they definitely are! The food is delicious, great sandwiches, chicken fingers, fresh cut fries, milkshakes with huge straws and salads. We make a stop here at least once a week for an easy lunch or dinner or just for a milkshake. Once you eat here you'll be saying Chick-Fil-Who??"}
{"text":"Love the fast service and the quality of the food. Hormone free meats, no frozen foods, friendly staff. They also have herbal infused sweet tea."}
{"text":"PDQ is my go-to when I don't feel like getting out of my car to get food or getting into my kitchen to make, or getting in my feelings after eating something quick that wasn't the healthiest option.   I'm currently into the rice bowls ( with grilled chicken I think these can be gluten free). The ingredients are fresh and tasty. There are also plenty of house made sauces to add if you like.  I've tried the honey butter chicken sandwich , which is dangerously delicious. The fresh-squeezed lemonade actually tastes fresh squeezed."}
{"text":"Busy...Lunch crowd they make killer chicken \"strips\" at least its not mystery meat. Good location next to Twin Peaks at Concord Mills seems to be a busy busy area as of late 4 bars added . a Adam and Eve and hotels just down the road what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried turkey sandwich. It tasted of burnt oil. Very disappointing. I will probably try the restaurant again and order the chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love PDQ... food is always good and service is great. We went yesterday and I got sweet Sriracha with my meal. The manager came around asking how everything was and I said the sauce tasted funny.... he went back to the kitchen, tried it, said they had forgotten the sugar, and made me a completely new batch! He even offered to send me home with an extra meal so I could enjoy the sauce."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to be able to try PDQ as a reviewer at a Yelp event. We got to sample rice bowls and the Pimento Cheese Chicken Crunch Sandwhich. The menu items were good, but I will look to visit in the future with some customizations! Prior to the event, I didn't know that you can order their sandwhiches on lettuce wraps. The friend chicken tenders are awesome, but I didn't love the texture of the chicken on the sandwhich. In the futute, I'd opt for grilled! The Pimento Cheese was a little new for me. It's not something I would ever order, but I really liked it! Smooth and creamy.   PDQ has a huge selection of homemade sauces which were really fun to try. Overall it's a stacked menu with options to go healthy. Looking forward to trying it again in the future."}
{"text":"Basically a fast food chicken joint instead of a fast food burger joint.  I had the salad with fried chicken strips. It was fine - nothing outstanding.  I asked for the chicken on the side and had no problems with that .  Iced tea as really good.  I asked about the zucchini fries- the server , Jeremy, gave me a generous sample . I had never eaten fried zucchini at a restaurant before but these were SO GOOD!   No real complaints except the music, though good, was extremely LOUD!!!   It was not difficult to find a clean table- a real plus!       So ,adequate menu if you you are craving chicken; clean surroundings; polite, helpful server.        Only dislikes were the volume of the music plus there was no bread, no crackers/croutons for the salad."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time tonight and was not disappointed! The food is pretty cheap and tasty. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. I really liked them both except for the fact that the pickles on my sandwich tasted more like cucumbers to me. Everyone was really friendly and the food came out very fast!"}
{"text":"Cleanliness has went downhill since we last came. 92.5 sanitation score. We ordered 20 tenders and they were anything but hot or fresh. We will continue going to the huntersville location from now on and skip this location."}
{"text":"A great place to eat in Concord, NC. It is very quick and the staff is super friendly! This is always a go to when I'm in town and it never disappoints, it is a little more on the pricey side of fast food however. You will not be disappointed if you stop by."}
{"text":"Today I tried PDQ Concord after attending a yelp event in March. I was so excited to get my hands on the yummy Pimento Chicken Sandwich. Due to the crazy storm we were experiencing today I opted for the drive thru.  The menu wears perfect! Very visible, easy to read and I really liked that instead of speaking through a speaker you spoke to an actual person. I drove up and shared with the young lady my order request. She was VERY polite, patient and fast with my order. I drove to the second window to pick up my food. The gentleman at the window was very prompt, alert and my cheerwine came in a bottle and not a cup!  As I left PDQ and was heading back to my side of town I decided to start enjoying my dinner. To my surprise it came to an end very quickly. The chicken breast that was on my sandwich was so small that I only ate half of my sandwich because that all that was available of chicken. This is the reason for my three stars in this location. Though everything else was excellent, for the restaurant to be known for chicken, you can't shorten your customer on your key ingredient."}
{"text":"If I want fast food I only get PDQ. If I'm going to eat friend food then it has to be worth it, and  not feel greasy after eating it. Pdq is worry every bite.."}
{"text":"I love this place this is really good really wholesome fast food I wish there was one actually in Charlotte like close to where I live"}
{"text":"Great tenders but the fries were soft and cold.  Overall I find the food to be better at their Cornelius location.  The Coke machine was out of 75% of its flavors. The tender quality saves a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We went the Concord PDQ 3-25-18 to grab a bite to eat. We had been there before with a Yelp event and came back. We asked for Jim, just to say hello as he said to do next time we popped in. He was not there. We placed our order for 2 pimento crunch (one with bacon and one without)...must say I was disappointed as the sandwich had little pimento cheese on it. The shoestring fries and zucchini fries were tasty. We also ordered a 4 piece  tender meal. When they called our name the 4 piece tender meal was missing, even clearly marked  on the ticket. I asked the line manager, Will, for the meal and was meet with a \"what are you missing\" with little to no customer care. A young lady stepped in at at that point and asked if she could help me. She relayed the need for the meal and it delayed taking food to the table as I then had to wait on the completion of my order. I must admit this was NOT what I had encountered at the Yelp event nor what I was expecting. I was highly disappointed in the brush off I felt from Will. I understand you are busy, but stop and take 2 seconds to talk to the customer with a smile on your face and find out the issue. I hope next time Jim is there if I come back."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by first saying I normally love the food-I eat at the one in Huntersville almost weekly and was very excited when the one in Concord opened as now I'd have one close to work and close to the house. At the beginning all was good-food, service, cleanliness...but this last visit started to show signs of the one thing that can kill any business...complacency.  I walked in at 4pm on a Wednesday-not a high traffic day/time.  Walked to the counter behind an associate who appeared to be on break, complaining to the cashier about how slow she was and didn't know what she was doing, he said he was joking but was doing his best about making a spectacle of himself as he yelled to one of the \"chefs jackets\" as she walked by, \" get her out of her-she doesn't know what she's doing\". Joking or not wasn't really what I would call professional. Then as he walked away the cashier went after him as he left a was of paper towels on the counter-to which he replied \"not my problem\". She started to walk away but then realized I was standing there and came back over to take my order, which I had to repeat to her three times and then when I went to go pick it up-it was partially wrong.  After picking up my tray-which was sitting there and the cashier was just looking at me after i got my drink. I had to walk past three table that didn't look like they had been wiped all day and finally found one that I wipes myself. Maybe it was a bad day, maybe it was just me.  Oh did I mention that as I was walking to get my drink a few employees were walking in and one of them bumped into me-to which I responded \"excuse me\" and he looked up in his black PDQ shirt and said \"whatever\"....."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at this restaurant since their menu offers something a little different than other restaurants.  Today I had the Cali Club(grilled chicken with ranch, bacon, avocado, lettuce, and tomato) with a side of zucchini fries.  Most of the time I get the grilled turkey breast sandwich(grilled turkey with traditional spices, mayo, lettuce, and cranberry) which is like something you'd eat at Thanksgiving.  Their sauces and dressings are made in-house.  The food is pretty good.  Today the cashier and other employees were very polite.  They had someone working the dining room keeping the tables clean.  The place looked really clean.  The posted sanitation grade was a 98!  I really like eating at this location."}
{"text":"First time here, and I was pretty impressed.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich, my boyfriend had tenders and my daughter also had tenders.  My sandwich was DELICIOUS. Pretty big size of chicken breast, and the portion of fries was perfect.   The tenders were great for my daughter, but size wise were not good for an adult. They were tasty non the less.   Only true complaints were the size of the tenders which were perfect size for kids and the fries. They needed to be more crispy.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hit the drive-thru window of this PDQ about once a week after work, which is about 9:30 PM. I've never eaten inside the restaurant, so this review is based on their takeout service and food.  The service is excellent. You drive up to a window and give your order directly to a person. I feel there is less chance for mix-ups when you're not yelling through a speaker. That person reviews your order, takes your money, and then you proceed to the pickup window. I've never had to wait long for my food to be ready.  The chicken tenders are fantastic, but the dipping sauces are what make them so good. I highly recommend the creamy garlic sauce, while my husband likes the  chipotle bbq. You can ask for as many sauces as you'd like and they are free of charge, so load up. I use them with my fries instead of ketchup. The fries are great and rank right up there in my list of favorites when I eat out.  I've only had a salad once and the dressings were wonderful. I asked for three different dressings because I couldn't make up my mind and, again, I wasn't charged for the extras. They have a Coke Freestyle machine so you can get whatever flavored soda your heart desires.  Haven't had a bad experience yet at this PDQ. If you haven't been you should really give it a try."}
{"text":"SOOOOO GOOD! I suggest their Honey Chicken Sandwich. Seriously the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The people are always super nice and for it being fast food it really does taste fresh. It's a little more expensive - a full meal runs about 10 bucks but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I use to love the food here drive 30 mins good food but the last 2 times the food was sub-par chicken was rubbery French Fry no good honestly reminds me of fry cooked in the oven at home that was left over from the day before and they don't seem to use seasoning any more. Year and a half later and this review is still on point!"}
{"text":"TENDER TIME!!!  That's what my co-worker and I yell at each other from our cubicles when it's time to eat here.  PDQ is all about the chicken, quick food, and service.  I think the jury is still out on the name, but hey... I guess it's memorable.  People Dedicated to Quality....  Everything on the menu is about fresh chicken:  sandwiches, salads, but probably their biggest draw is their \"fresh tenders\" and homemade dipping sauces.  Now, this location is up in front of the Academy Sports near Concord Mills... so if I worked somewhere else, I probably wouldn't make a special trip to go here - but fortunately for me I try to hit \"tender time\" once every 2 weeks or so to get my fix.  The tables are always clean and the staff is super friendly, but probably the best part about the experience is having your order called out....  \"#insertname your hot fresh tenders are ready!\"  Depending on who is on the mike that day... it makes for some interesting entertainment.  There is a drive thru, but the dine in experience is where it is at.  Just be careful since the drive thru wraps and some cars are a little too eager to get their tender time on.  Probably my biggest criticism is how the line forms in this place.  They try to funnel all the \"dine in\" people through one door (the farthest from the parking lot) so naturally people come into the side and don't realize their is a line against the wall and they end up skipping folks in line.  A lot of it in unintentional, but people please be aware of your surroundings and actually read signs!!!  Lucikly, PDQ is fast enough to where it doesn't really make that much difference, but it's just annoying... especially when people realize there is a line and still continue to cut in front of everyone anyway!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Chicken is chicken. Service was excellent. Got my meal pretty darn quick! HA! Ordered the Cali sandwich. Good sandwich. Fresh avocado. Chicken was nice and tender. It's not Chick-fil-A, but it's definitely not KFC. They do seem to have a little more variety than Chick-fil-A though. But then again, how many different ways can you serve chicken?"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken fingers, very fresh, and they have a few different sauces to dip your tenders in."}
{"text":"Found a great place for a quick meal during lunch or dinner.  Looking forward to going back.  12/2015 - Still my favorite.  The food is alway freshly made and hot."}
{"text":"The little for find is great. I'm in love with the quality of the food. The chicken is nicely seasoned and the portion sizes are nice. They have unique sauce and I just love the garlic one. I always finish it up with the apples with the carmel sauce omgoodness I can taste it now. If you have gone to 131 main and had there chicken fingers they are the same. I go here every chance I have."}
{"text":"Very good place for a quick lunch.  The hubs had a crispy turkey sandwich and fries. I had the crispy chicken salad.  Both were great.  My salad greens were cool and fresh and the chicken was hot and tasty.  The bite or three I had of his sandwich was surprisingly good!  Never had crispy turkey before but it was really good.  Staff were friendly. Bathroom was clean.  No complaints.  TV playing ESPN (which made the hubs happy).  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I love PDQ in Concord, it's always well run, clean, great service, consistent. Which is all such a change from normal fast food places. The chicken tenders are as good as you can get anywhere, and I love the handmade sauces. Buffalo blue is my fav! And you gotta have the shakes. They even use the big shake straws, so you don't have to strain a muscle in your neck trying to drink it. I eat here every other week or so. Great place."}
{"text":"Came in after picking up MLB from the Concord Regional, both of us needing something sensible and filling having missed lunch. In spite of help from G-maps we managed to find our way in. BTW: nice sink! Didn't notice signage for \"order here\" but lately I've been missing that sort of thing... figured it out while looking at dual inclined menu boards. Put in a request for honey butter meal, a thai peanut bowl, tea, and a cookie. The dual soda-matics for mixing your poison (mellow-peacho!), ketchup fountains, and jugs of tea are off to the right across from the industrial hand sink. Got our stuff, picked a booth, and a few minutes later our food found us. Yea food! Crispy breaded chickens with honeyed butter on top and pickles on the bottom. A couple well placed drops of hot sauce and it's good to go. Skinny fries but not too skinny, just enough sag for safe consumption. Certainly one of the better chick-sand I've had; breading is light-crisp-clean, not greasy and tasting like last night. Salad was a little light on dressing but that was easy enough to fix. I'm not sure what happened to the cookie, maybe it evaporated? I'm getting used to the medium-ist decorating scheme; basic but not stark seating options at tables and booths. High ceilings with lots of windows is very relaxing and there's a four season porch off the main floor for special events. And they'e got this industrial hand sink too, no excuse for not washing up."}
{"text":"Buffalo Blue sandwich is my favorite! Especially with ranch on the side to dip it in! This place has the best ranch on the planet!!!!!! The zucchini fries are amazing and totally worth the up charge to have it as your side!"}
{"text":"Let's start at the beginning. This isn't Chick-Fil-A. But that doesn't mean that it is bad, either. In fact, it's quite tasty - it isn't quite fast food, and it isn't quite fast casual either, instead it's that somewhere in-between.  Where on the burger side, you have places like Freddy's, Five Guys and Smashburger, chicken has oddly been left out. No longer, as now you have PDQ, offering up a healthier take. Okay, it's probably not a lot healthier, but it certainly seems to be a lot better than KFC or Popeyes (and yes, perhaps even CFA).  The place is warm and inviting, service is friendly, and it's worth a look if you're stuck in the nightmarish traffic around Concord Mills."}
{"text":"Having recently moved in the area, my fiancé and I were looking for something quick (read: fast food). I fired up Yelp, and this place came up with it's shiny rating. Looked up some reviews and we had made our decision. We happened to be here at the wrong time though. Sunday for lunch, which means the place was jam-packed with people grabbing a bite after church. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and my fiancé got the grilled turkey sandwich with a side of blueberry coleslaw. Both our sandwiches were delicious! At first I was skeptical of the blueberry coleslaw and the turkey sandwich but I soon got over it as I swapped my lunch for his. The turkey sandwich comes with cranberry sauce (mmm, Thanksgiving dinner!) and the blueberry coleslaw is out of this world. They also have the fancy soda machine that has a million choices. The guy announcing people's names for orders was particularly entertaining. I suspect he worked as a commentator for some stadium or something."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to stop by here for some to go food. The staff was very friendly! I liked how there was a hand washing station as well. We asked a few questions and ordered our food. We each got chicken tenders with fries and zucchini fries. By the time we paid, they called our name to let us know our food is ready! Talk about fast service!! Good location and good food! I just wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Best grilled chicken salad ever. I chose this restaurant for the healthy choices in fast food, quality service and fast food preparation.  I haven't had a bad item on the menu. Cleanliness is always at its best. Drive through or carry out available and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh. Always clean It can get really busy and they're still fast Our food is always hot The staff is friendly There are so many things I like. They have a sink to wash your hands. The drinks are self service and you can get lemon, lids, and straws right there You can watch them coat the chicken right in front of your eyes The kitchen is open so you can see what is going on Lots of seating and always someone cleaning  Both the inside and the drive through are fast Fresh choice in food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today.   Great place!   Manager was super nice, service was fast, and restaurant was very clean with a bright, airy feel to it.    I got the honey butter chicken sandwich.  It was ok, but I might would try a different one next time as it was kind of bland, but that is more my taste buds than a reflection on the sandwich.  My wife got the chicken tenders and they were excellent.      The dipping sauces were all good, but the creamy garlic was my favorite (not real garlicky and goes great with chicken tenders and the fries.     Be sure to try the apple slices with toffee dip for a fantastic summery dessert."}
{"text":"I guess the newness has worn off.  Tenders are just ok, fries ok."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try! It was ok - the fries were a little more greasy and stringy than I expected but honestly I didn't know what to expect since I've never been here before. Haha. The service was very nice. I think it's a little overpriced for my taste but otherwise wasn't bad. Would be interested to try their shakes. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This is my first trip here, I do have to say I'm pretty impressed at what I saw. The staff was very nice, hospitable and pleasant. The restaurant itself was brightly lit due to the windows in the restaurant. The interior has a very modern feel to it. My friends and I had ordered the spicy buffalo tender sandwich that came with the fresh cut fries. The sandwich and fries tasted great and done just right. The buffalo sauce had just the right consistency of a spiciness and sourness. The best thing I liked about the meal was the sauces that they gave you, I tried the creamy garlic sauce which was between ranch and honey mustard but still very good considering the fact that it was home made"}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwiches and salads. It's hard to believe this place is considered fast-food with the quality they offer"}
{"text":"This past Saturday June 4th, we place our order at the drive thru, got home and two three piece chicken tenders and one fries were missing.  I called to speak with manager, I explain what happened and she replied most of the crew are still in training and error happen here and there, that she would speak to the individual who packed our order, I told her please don't fired the person, advise them to be careful, it's not good to get all the way home and the order is messed up, not everyone lives near by.  She was most regretful for the error conveyed understanding of our disappointment. She said she will resubmit our order and replace the missing items. I told her we come there (food is good) frequently and notice that when we order from the drive thru sometimes the chicken tender pieces are smaller than when you stay in and again I went on to explain; it's upsetting to get home to find your order is missing food that you paid for, sitting down to eat and everyone can't eat.  Our daughter drive back to pick up the missing items; to our delight she replaced the missing food and doubled our order plus credited back the $31+ dollars to my account.  it's great that good customer service still exists!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times.  Every time the staff is friendly and the food is hot and fresh.    Their fries are the \"skinny\" kind.  They cut the potatoes in store.  So good!  I've had their grilled chicken sandwiches, fries and grilled salads.  All are very good.   Try the Granny Smith apple slices with their caramel sauce.  You won't be disappointed   Unfortunately their sanitation rating has dropped to 92.5.  That is a little too low for me.    I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for their low sanitation rating."}
{"text":"Delicious! Extremely fast, puts a traditional fatty food joint to shame."}
{"text":"We have been here twice with our 3 kids. First time we were not impressed and same thing for the second and probably last time. This place is overhyped. Many of the kids tenders had tendons making them hard to eat. The chicken sandwich was OK, but not great. Again I don't understand the hype. They didn't even have regular milk for kids meals,only YooHoo. We will stick with CFa."}
{"text":"Today I made my first and second trip to PDQ and know there will be more to come!  The best thing about the restaurant is that it is CLEAN (sanitation score was a 99)!  When you enter its not entirely clear where you're supposed to go to order, but the layout is very open and bright. Jordan had the grilled chicken sandwich and I the grilled turkey. The food was fresh and didn't taste like your average Mickey D's sandwich.  The fries were shoe string style (not my favorite), but they were seasoned well.  My absolute favorite thing and the reason I made a second trip to PDQ was for the fresh lemonade!  The lemonade was so tart but so good!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I was very disappointed.  I order the combo which includes small soda, chicken strips, and fries.  It was awful and WAY overprice.  For $7.50 I received 3 small unseasoned, burnt chicken strips, burnt french fries, and a soda.  I twitted this place and no response.  I highly suggest for consumer NOT ...NEVER EVER go to this place.  You can get a full meal that is more delicious than this place.  Seriously!  $7.50 not including tax for just 3 chicken strip. No wonder you don't get more customers driving by."}
{"text":"I've been to PDQ several times before and never hesitate coming back here.  I also recently attended a PDQ Yelp event as a guest. I visited this PDQ on a fairly quiet Saturday evening.  It wasn't too crowded, so we ordered and received our food quickly.  I tried one of their new menu items, the Pimento Crunch sandwich. I'm not a huge sandwich person but had tried this one out at the Yelp event and loved it.  I still love it.  I enjoyed the mixture of the chicken, pimento cheese, potato chips, and bacon. It was delicious and I ate every bite.  The texture is different...I'm definitely not used to eating chips on a sandwich.  Per the usual, I got the apple slices with toffee dip. I tell myself it's to be healthy, but let's be honest--it's for the toffee dip. I literally would come to PDQ just for this dip. So. Good.  Overall, great experience and good food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's your average chickens trip joint. However, they have no flavor. I ordered the crispy chicken salad and fried zucchini. Thank goodness they have sauces to dip in because the chicken and the fried zucchini flower is bland. I was shocked because I could physically see the seasonings in the batter . I'm not sure if this was a one off?   Positive, is they make your food fresh and the chicken is never frozen. However, if you want full flavor this is not the place for you.  I must say the staff was very professional and nice. I had no issue with the service."}
{"text":"First off, the customer service is excellent! Once we had our food at least three different employees came by to check on us, refill our drinks, and take our trash. Chic fil a watch out they coming for you!   The tenders are my go to buy their fries are so so. I prefer the zucchini fries but most importantly those apples and that dip is what keeps me coming back! My husband always says you just come here to eat apples and that's very true lol. They have a ton of dipping sauces my favorite is the ranch, the honey BBQ has a weird aftertaste.   P.S.-They have a hand washing station!"}
{"text":"I loooooooove PDQ. I always crave it after church on Sunday so I go through the drive-thru or go inside. I get the crispy chicken sandwich without mayo, add ranch. (Their homemade ranch is AMAZING - I get a side for my fries too). Their fries are fantastic - seasoning is perfect and just the right size. Definitely helps that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. Definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place and how good some of the menu items are.  There was a very long line at lunchtime on a weekday.  The staff moved very quickly and efficiently to get it moving fast.  There was hardly any wait for the food.    I got the crispy chicken BLT with avocado.  It was really good.  I did not like that the avocado was mashed up, though, like guacamole.  It should definitely read that in the description.  It was kind of a disappointment.  I also didn't care much for the tater tots.  They were way too salty and very underwhelming.    The chicken and the bun on the sandwich was great.  They have a lot of sauces to choose from.  I tasted the honey mustard and the ranch, both were good."}
{"text":"Great service, and stupidly inexpensive. Food is all very oily, but I mean if ya ass need to eat is that really that big of an issue? Nah. Good eats."}
{"text":"These gents have capitalized on the \"Fresh\" movement. Great at Fresh never frozen hand breaded chicken and turkey! Watch out Chick Filet , your competition is at the door! They would own the market if they could do Organic!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great and refreshing for a better quality fast food place. The place was very clean and service was good.  The zucchini fries are delicious and they also support sandwiches without the bun and using lettuce.  I had a Cali Club chicken sandwich with lettuce which was good.  It would had probably been better if I tried one of the dipping sauces.  The salads also came out nice and  my mother tried one with a blueberry vinaigrette.  They also have some turkey burgers.  Their french fries are good too! A nice variety of food on their menu and would love to try their chicken tenders in the future!  They have a nice variety of sauces and offer a generous amount!  I'd certainly come back if there was a closed PDQ near me!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken fingers, fries and salads.    Fast service and clean.  Entire family a fan."}
{"text":"After coming a few more times, I'd be doing this place a disservice by not giving them a 5. The food is awesome, the service is phenomenal, this place tries really hard to give you a 5 star worthy experience."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite chicken place.  Clean, reasonably priced and so incredibly friendly.  The food was yummy, fresh and very fairly sized portions.  I substituted zucchini fries instead of french fries and they were deeelicious!!!  They just melted in your mouth, seriously.   My kids enjoyed it, a lot, too.  And while they don't have them in our home town, we looked it up and they do have locations where the grandparents live, so we will definitely return.   I liked it so much that I actually looked up how their franchises work!"}
{"text":"What an awesome accidental meet up last night at Concord PDQ! My family and I headed that way for a late, tasty, quick meal (they are pretty darn quick, after all!) and met up with the YELP crew who were doing the MUNCHIE nite. After some warm hugs from Nikki and Tonya, and meeting the GM, Jim, we ordered our grub. I listened to Jim and got the new Pimento Crunch sandwich (as did my wife). I can truly say that this was an excellent offering with bacon, pimento cheese, their always delightful chicken, and crispy tater chips. That's a SAMMICH! Along with tots and I'm a fairly happy daddy! Then Jim came by and dropped off a couple the new rice bowls for us to try. The Thai Peanut bowl and the Queso bowl. Both were quite excellent and that's with me not usually being a very big fan of peanut sauce. If I have one issue with PDQ is that the fries seem to have changed from the original and though still good, are not quite AS good. BUT there is tater tots so I would never get fries again anyhow! (Big tot fan here, you betcha!) But overall, as per usual, food was super solid, service was on point and speed of food was as advertised. We are fans and will continue to frequent PDQ especially with the new menu offerings that make sure we don't get bored. Good on you and your staff, Jim!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? PDQ was one of those places i just tried for some quick meal. But i just couldnt believe how delicious the food was. I can only put it this way. PDQ is my new favorite chicken spot. Move over KFC, PDQ is so much better!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to experience PDQ's Delectable cuisine's with my Fellow elites for Munch Madness and OMG there were so many wonderful fresh dishes at this restaurant you'd dare to call it fast food! An accurate description would be, fresh not frozen cooked to order mouthwatering goodness!  PDQ is a quality establishment that cares about the food they prepare! I had the pleasure of meeting the Operating Director Jim C who treated us like family and he was extremely knowledgeable of PDQ and the entire product line! Jim takes the food and service personal; he serves and presents it with pride.  My favorite items was a toss up between the rice bowl which had crispy chicken with sauce, beans, broccoli, and fresh mango and the pimento chicken sandwich which was laced with lettuces bacon and potato chips on a soft brioche bun (simply mouthwatering). I think I may dream about that chicken sandwich tonight!  Stay tuned to their \"flash shakes!\""}
{"text":"Stopped & wanted something fast but good, had never herd of this place. Very surprised GREAT! Place. Hope to see one in the Lynchburg, Va area soon. The chicken seemed to be fresh and not frozen great little place. Good prices."}
{"text":"A very strange name for a chicken tender joint, but PDQ stands for People Dedicated to Quality.  I wonder if a joint can sustain itself by just serving chicken tenders and fries.  I guess they're trying to model their business after in n' out burger, which I love, but it didn't seem like they had a secret menu here.  So, I just ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich served on a nice roll.  I always pu pu chicken joints that make chicken sandwiches out of tenders vice a whole filet.  They give you a generous amount of shoestring sized fresh cut fries to go with the entree, and the fries were good.  Chicken tender basket only comes with 2 tenders.  Walking in, they have a sink right by the counter where people can wash their hands, so there seems to be a big push on cleanliness with this joint.  Plenty of ice tea options and they also had two of those mega smart screen soda dispensers.  Milk shakes 1/2 off during off hours, and they were good."}
{"text":"Quick lunch with the hubby and PDQ is always a good choice. Its always clean and quick! We are always greeted warmly by the cashier. We both had the four-piece meal combo which is very filling. I did notice this time that the name of my favorite sauce, sweet heat, had changed. I guess Taco Bell purchased the name and PDQ can no longer use it. Who knew?"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Monday. I had the honey butter chicken sandwich, my husband had the pimento crunch sandwich, and our daughter had the nuggets kid's meal.  The honey butter sandwich was really messy to eat, but the flavors were okay. I liked the pimento cheese crunch sandwich wayyyy better though. The chicken was well cooked. I'm not sure what, but something in the marinade or batter of the chicken is off-putting when eaten by itself.   We both had zucchini fries with our sandwich and they were great. The dipping sauces (ranch especially) were super too. We also had a banana pudding milkshake which tasted just like drinking banana pudding, but was so good. The cookies (chocolate chunk and oatmeal crabapple) were okay. I've had way better, but I've also had worse.   Not bad at all. But I feel like there are better options too."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwiches are good, and we love the zucchini fries!  The kids love the chicken nuggets, and fries!  4 stars because it is a bit pricey, and menu is small."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit to PDQ.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad with blueberry-ginger vinaigrette salad dressing.  The salad was on point.  The dressing was tasty as well, however, I was a bit taken aback by its consistency which was thick and pasty-like.  That aside, the restaurant has an array of drinks and I could not resist the Vanilla Coke for an afternoon thirst-quencher.    The hand-washing station is stationed so that you have no excuse to avoid the spread of germs.  BTW, PDQ stands for People Dedicated to Quality.  Needless to say, that was evident during our visit.  We were consulted to ensure everything was well at our table and when we informed one staff member that the sweet tea was not sweetened, it was handled immediately.  The staff are always cleaning up and tending to the restaurant and patrons.    I look forward to visiting again.  Thank you PDQ for a great restaurant experience.  Please open a location closer to my home."}
{"text":"PDQ has quality food and excellent customer service. You can tell they care about the needs of the customer. The staff takes the time to make sure your order is correct, and you receive fresh food that is hot. I do wish they give you a little bit more food, but PDQ makes up for it with the service excellent approach."}
{"text":"Wow this place has amazing customer service; from the moment you walk through the door until you leave. Extremely clean as well. Food was fantastic for fast food. Very impressed and will be sure to visit this location again."}
{"text":"I'm not incredibly impressed.  Very over priced and a menu far more limited than I expected.  During my first encounter I was served a chicken sandwich with bad lettuce and when I asked for an ice water I was charged.  Yep, that's right folks, Dasani on tap!  So when you order water you pay the same price you would for a soda.  Seriously?  My second visit was a little better but the chicken still isn't anything spectacular.  I was impressed with their house made BBQ sauce.  That, and that alone, would be the only reason I'd ever return.  \"BBQ sauce to go please!\"  As a self proclaimed milkshake connoisseur, I was even let down on that front.  Boo for PDQ!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE* I was contacted by the district manage, he requested my address. A few weeks later i received about 9 coupons good for 3 chicken tenders, a sandwich or a salad. I appreciate that they finally made and effort, however, for me it was a little to late. I gave the coupons to my daughter for her and her fiance. I'll stick with my new found Concord favorite Steak N' Shake!"}
{"text":"I how fresh the food tastes here! We came here last weekend as my roommate had a PDQ craving. Got here late so there wasn't a line. The menu is short, sweet and simple..  I got the grilled chicken salad and wow I was surprised at how satisfying it was. The crunchy almond bits are my favorite. The blueberry ginger dressing sounds weird but pairs very well with the seasoned grilled chicken for a perfect savory and sweet meal.   We will definitely be coming back, especially for half priced milkshakes from 3-5p everyday!"}
{"text":"These people have the most tasty, juicy, fresh chicken I've ever had! Puts chickfila to shame! Try their tenders with some garlic aioli sauce---ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try again since the menu had some changes and I was in the area . Tried the Thai bowl and added avocado . Upon first impression it was saddening that the avocado was not fresh slices but more of a Guacamole style mash.  The rice was cold and hard , broccoli cold and chicken Luke warm . Ughhh I was so over it, I didn't even bother to go back in the drive thru and get my money back .  Guess I'll just mark this place off my list forever."}
{"text":"I say this place has the best fast food I've ever tasted, however it's too good to be called fast food. Great , fresh food, great service"}
{"text":"When it comes to anything fast food, this is hands down my first choice.   I guess you could come here for the salads, but why do that? And I wouldn't be mad at you for coming for sandwich. Even though those are just okay.  But the real winner here are their tenders and fries. And if you go and they have the zucchini fries still - just do it. 5 stars just for their tenders, fries and sauces.   The tenders are banging. And you know what I love? You have the choice between grilled and crispy. So you can eat fast food and make a healthy choice. Love this. And the grilled tenders are moist and flavorful. The crispy are still my favorite - fat girl problems. The chicken tenders are not made from processed chicken either. You get the real deal.  So let's talk about sauces - creamy garlic is where it is at. But everything else is good too. The ranch - banging, the honey mustard - banging, the chipotle bbq - banging. And get this - they are not stingy with their sauces. Want more, they give you more. I mean how crazy of a concept is that. And the sauce are the not only delicious with the tenders but also so delicious with the fries. I need to find out if they bottle and sell their sauces because I would buy that creamy garlic. It is amazing. Fresh and zingy but without being to sharp in flavor.   And I do enjoy their blueberry coleslaw. I do have to add a little salt to mine because I find it slightly under seasoned but most coleslaw is. I think the addition of salt just makes the cabbage lose it's crunchy factor and draws out too much water - so I get this. But the fresh blueberries are a special treat in this coleslaw and make me feel like I am eating something healthy.  Oh, Apples! My sweet treat every time we go. Fresh apples that they keep from browning in that lemon concoction. The green apples that are slightly tart pair so well with that sweet toffee dip. Again, I feel like I am eating healthy. (Let's pretend that toffee dip is sugar free and has no calories.)  Overall, this is hands down a family favorite for us."}
