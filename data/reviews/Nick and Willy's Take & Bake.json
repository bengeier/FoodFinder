{"text":"This is my first yelp. Im from new york and I know good pizzA. THIS WAS THE WORST PIZZA I HAD EVER EATEN. MY HUSBAND TOOK A BITE AND WAS NOT PLEASED.  AND THE SERVICE WAS JUST AS BAD AS THE  PIZZA. I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN NOR DO I RECOMMEND IT DUE TO UNSANITARY REASONS."}
{"text":"Get in my belly!  This is some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I LOVE the \"Aegean\" the best.  High end ingredients.  You can \"take and bake\" or have them cook it for you.  SUPER friendly staff and they always have everything ready on time.  LOTS of specialty pizza and they'll also custom make anything you want.  Eat it up.  :)"}
{"text":"The pizza in this place absolutely rocks. The ingredients are top notch and the crust is wonderful. If you are looking for a quick no frills pizza fix this is the place to hit up if you are in the area.  It is located in a strip mall with an AJ's Fine Foods on 7th Street just south of Thunderbird. I've lived in the area for about a year before I even tried this place because it seemed so non-descript. One day the wife and I decided to give it a try ever since it has been in our pizza rotation.  Although the restaurant is very clean and stylish and they serve beer (bottled), the ambience is a little weak and I wouldn't really couldn't recommend it as a date place or fun joint to hang out in. It is bright and has more of a fast food/deli type of feel. It not like a Oregano's where you could go out with a group of friends get a pitcher of beer and kick back in the dim light absorbing the ambience looking at all of the leftover tchotchkis from Buca Di Beppo grace the walls with people ordering pizza, sandiwiches and pasta dishes...  This is strictly a pizza joint, pretty much just pizza, a few salads and a pizza cookie is all they serve. But their pizza is fabulous. I used to make my own homemade dough and pizza all the time, it is incredible. Nick and Willy's tastes just like really good homemade hand-tossed pizza. Their pizza is second to none. A really fantastic thin crust. It is not cracker thin like Oregano's, it has just enough crust so that you can taste it, whereas Oregano's is pretty much an untasteable wafer thin piece of cardboard serving just to hold the toppings.  You can eat at the pizza bar and watch them make the pizzas as well as look up in the corner and check out what is on the permatuned FoodNetwork with closed captioning on the TV or you eat at on of the five or six little tables in the joint.  I don't think that they deliver. It looks like it is dine in or pick up only. One more thing to mention. One of their big claims to fame seems to be that you can pick up a ready made pizza that is uncooked to take home and throw into the oven. This seems like it'd be great but we tried it a few times using my pizza stone, an open air pan, the cardboard bake-in pan that the pizza comes in and out on the grill. The stone was good but the grill came out best but even so for some reason it just doesn't taste as good as the actual cooked at Nick and Willy's pizza's. The take and bake pizzas only seem to taste about 70% as good as the phenomenal ones cooked at the restaurant.   The service is good. The manager, Pat (don't know if he is the owner), is great and a real nice guy. A few more things. They have an all you can eat deal where you pay $7.50 and they'll hook you up with a salad, a drink (free refills), and a little personal pizza, you can choose between the daily special pizza, a cheese or a pepperoni. Then they'll crank out as many salads and personal pizza's as you want. The pizzas are small maybe they size of two normal slices and it takes about ten minutes or so for the next pizza to get made and baked after you ask for it so just keep that in mind.  Also from the memerobilia and reviews on the walls, this place seems to be a chain that started out of Boulder, Colorado. I haven't found any other Valley locations though..."}
