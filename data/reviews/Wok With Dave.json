{"text":"Great Chinese take out. Delivery was fast and food was hot. The portions were huge and this will be our go to Chinese delivery from now on.   Okay so lets start with the good.   Ginger Chicken - Chicken was easy to eat, not stringy or chewy with a nice breaded coating and the ginger sauce was spot on. Huge portion and well balanced with the sauce.   Beef Chow Mien - Great dish with tender beef chunks, loads of noodles spiced right with some tasty onions and sprouts to finish it off.   Chicken fried rice - Absolutely one of the best I have ever eaten. The flavour was amazing with a good portion of egg and chicken with the right amount of peas. Usually we drown our rice in soya sauce but this needed nothing. It was great just the way it was.   Wonton Soup - Good amount of wontons with a simple broth. Nothing amazing but a good starter.   Now the not so good.   Beef Hot pot - This is the one dish that lost them the final star. It was bland, the veggies were poor and beef was rubbery. I personally will not order this dish again.   All in all a solid place for Chinese food and we will explore some new dishes next time."}
{"text":"Nice food, I love their chicken wings most, but pretty much everything taste nice."}
{"text":"We have been ordering takeout from Dave's for years.  Given what is in the area for Chinese takeout--this is by far the best."}
{"text":"In the geometric centre of Ranchlands, which is a neighbourhood of endless curving roads and cul-de-sacs, there is an oasis-like strip mall amongst a desert of single-family houses. Wok with Dave is a tiny takeout outlet with a very wide menu. We split the Stir Fried Mixed Vegetables and the Chicken Fried Rice, and they both turned out better than we expected. The rice has lots of diced chicken, peas, fried egg shreds and mushrooms and it tasted great. The tin of stirfried vegetables included carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, baby corn, onions, broccoli, and a bunch of other items in a nice light sauce. Some might find our choices kind of boring, but we're not going to be adventurously carnivorous when one of us is vegan. So warm up your GPS and find this place."}
{"text":"A nice local place with decent home style food. This is a family restaurant so don't expect chic chic bullshit from the food channel. The owners may be rough around the edges but are the good honest small business people that great neighborhood places have."}
{"text":"Does anyone know if there been a change over in ownership?    This has been my favorite Chinese food restaurant for decades. I have been getting Chinese food from Dave, ever since they had a restaurant in Edgemont. My go to favorites have been their Cantonese chow mein and ginger beef. Their ginger beef is like chewy beef candy. It's so good hot or cold. The flavoring of the chow mein has been the best. I grew up with this taste and I haven't found it anywhere else.   I don't live here in anymore but when I come to visit, I order my two favorite dishes at least twice in one week. I've noticed a slight change in flavoring and the vegetables are different. The chow mein has always been the same but now it's different.   Has anyone else noticed any changes?"}
