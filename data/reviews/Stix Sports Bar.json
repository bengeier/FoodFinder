{"text":"I've come here a couple times. This place honestly confuses me. There's a couch, some tables and a bunch of pool tables. I'd rather get rid of the couch and put more tables / better tables than put eye sore in the center of the room. Also it's sinking in a places and has this general nasty-ness to it. (I wasn't sitting there but I couldn't help but stare at the guys who were as I watched them sink into sections of the couch when they leaned forward to eat their food.)   Our server was nice but you could tell she was pissed off. She was one of two servers working and it was busy. Being that she was one of two people working it took awhile to get both drinks, our order of wings placed, and to finally get them in the end.  Obviously these things were not her fault and she was buzzing around all her tables cleaning and taking orders as fast as she could. I really did feel for her and the other girl working. My brother and I got the honey hot wings. They were really good the sauce could have been mixed through just a bit more though some wings were pure hot sauce and others had a nice blend of the two.  Over all they have really good wings and since I was DD I do not know the beer selection I'm sure it was pretty standard though. They ran out of the \"Overtime\" wing flavor which is a bummer because it is my favorite to get from there. Oh well maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a generic strip mall in the Southwest, there's a pretty funky sports bar/pool hall with a mighty extensive menu, helpful staff and a cool atmosphere to boot. The interior is surprisingly spacious, easily accommodating the 10 pool tables and 3 cozy lounge areas.  I'm a guy who seeks out a good deal - especially when it comes to alcohol - so I was impressed with the $2.75 price tag on domestic beer, highballs, and 12oz draft, weekdays from 3-6pm. When they told me I got a free half hour of pool with my libation, I was in it to win it!  If watching UFC is your thing, Stix carries all the major fight cards for a $10 cover charge.  Add it all up and you've got a diamond in the rough, so roll on over - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night, we had the mozza sticks and an order of wings, neither were very good and I was glad we didn't order more food. The place is kind of sketch inside, looks like they are in the process of closing down. There was barely anyone there, a few older people sitting at the bar, seemed like they were regulars. The Tv's aren't HD which I have come to expect from a \"sports pub\". The only good thing was the server/bar tender was really nice.  Won't  be back."}
{"text":"This was a busy place about 20 years ago when it was a regular hang out for me and my buddies. It used to have great pool tables and you often had to wait for a table almost any evening, even though there was well over a dozen in the place. It was always busy. Went back yesterday (on a Sunday afternoon) with an old friend and I can't believe how downhill its gone.   First of all, the pool tables are completely rundown. The surfaces are badly worn and stained and there's only a few, beat up cues. The walls are beat up and a trip to the men's room really showed how neglected this place has become. The door handle to the stall was missing so you had to turn the inside hardware of the handle. Also, no soap in either of the dispensers.  I arrived before my friend did and decided to eat (this was before I'd made a trip to the bathroom, otherwise I would have skipped the food). The bartender raved about the food and I asked what he recommended. He said the curry chicken was great so I ordered it. When it arrived, it basically looked like an entire jar of store bought sauce cooked in a lot of oil and dumped on a plate with some overcooked broccoli scattered around. However, the rice was perfectly cooked. I could only eat the pieces of chicken and some plain rice as the sauce was just too greasy and had a bitter aftertaste.  It was sad to see a place that used to be so lively turn into such a dump."}
{"text":"The strangest thing about this sports bar, is that although appearing to be average on every level, the food is exceptional. The steak was seasoned well and cooked properly and my girlfriend continues to go on about the pesto chicken sandwich. Everything was fresh and hot. Stix looks like just another \"neighbourhood pub\"/pool hall in a strip centre, but the food is worth going for. Our server told us they had a kid in the kitchen cooking. I'm not sure how old he was, but he wasn't allowed out front. Which is just as well, I guess, he can spend his time focusing on good food which he seems to be doing. Eventually he'll go through puberty and his thoughts will wander elsewhere, but for now, the food here is excellent and should require a stop to check it out."}
{"text":"Bad service, pool tables are 10 years old and the felt is ripped and beer stained. Place is dirty and the walls are even disgusting. Pool cues are broken.... owner doesn't care about this place."}
{"text":"Some people like eating and playing pool at a place with mouse droppings all over the floor"}
{"text":"By walking into this pub I would have never ever expected my review to be over one star but...we went for wing night night and pushed through our first impressions and sat down.  The clientele is quite mixed, young and old.  When you first enter you are overwhelmed with pool tables - you have to pass by this area to enter another area with tables and couches.  The server was wearing street clothes and seriously looked like someone who hopped off a bar stool and wandered over to help out.  They have a rule on wing night one order beer beverage.  Since three of the five of us were drinking we could order right away.  Hunger was high and expectations were low.  Although my curiosity was peaked by the flavor choices, like gunpowder suicide, overtime and szechwan thai and hot-yaki.  Well, beers in hand (remember one per order of wings!) our wings arrived and the devouring began.  Some of the the yummiest wings I have had.  Everyone at the table agreed.  We started ordering another round of beers to get more wings.  We feasted.  We moaned.  We agreed - totally worth everything else just to eat these wings.    Totes stripmall gem."}
{"text":"Last night was *THE* game, and by that I can only be referring to one thing: The game in which MY TEAM (The Chicago Blackhawks) won the Stanley Cup after a 49 year drought. AWWWWWWWW. YEEEEEEEAH. (I'd just like to remind the world that I called their victory from the very beginning).  A group of us met up at Stix. It was an alright place to be. It is spacious as Jason G. mentions but I'll be honest - last night, there wasn't an  open seat in the house.  The food was EXCEPTIONAL (so I'm told). The only options for vegetarians are pizza, mac n' cheese, or salad. I had salad.   The service was good despite the place being packed.  Probably not top on my list for places to have wanted to watch such an exciting game, but hey, when the Hawks are takin' home the cup, I'm happy to watch the game just about anywhere!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good for a pub.  Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I do not like writing a bad review after just one experience but I hope someone reads this and decides to go elsewhere. I went here with a friend and was taken back by how much it had changed in the past few years. It has gone from a some what classy pool hall that offers good food to a hang out for drunks and rowdies. Looking around Calgary there really isn't not much in the way of nice pool halls but this used to be one of them.   The music was far too loud, and awful! The group next to our table were clearly being over served and had language that would make Howard Stern blush. The servers choice of clothing did not bring anything to the experience but made them look like customers and the whole place had an sloppy feel to it. A little TLC could spruce up the place pretty quick.   Now while I was there I knew I would write a review so even though my date cautioned me to avoid the menu I tried one of the apps. I have to say that the food quality was by far the high light of the night. The food tasted fresh, moist, and was presented in a pleasant manner. Unfortunately there are hundreds of places in Calgary with great food that do not blast bad rock music and have rowdy drunks coming over to take to you while you are on a date. Guess I am going to have to buy a pool table rather then hold out hope for a good place to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is called a sports bar, but it might as well re-label itself as a pool hall, cause (at least when I was there) that seemed to be what everybody was there for. Not to mention the fact that the tables take up well over half of the floor space.  While they could definitely use some new cues, and the tables are hit and miss, where they succeed they do so quite well. Sure, they're still far  from being ready to host the pros, but after trying a couple we found a table that, despite some discoloration and LOOKING a little worn, played far better than you expect a bar room table to play.  As for the bar aspects of the establishment, most of them were pretty much what you'd expect - no more, no less. Nothing really stood out as any better or worse than any other bar I'd walked into in the city. The drinks were pretty much the same prices as everywhere, the service was adequate. The only other thing that really stood out was the food. I'd especially recommend the 'sweet chili chicken' which I was hesitant to try based on the 'chili' part (as I'm rather intolerant of anything remotely resembling spicey flavors) but it was AWESOME. Nice little bite-sized appetizer pieces of chicken in a great, pseudo-sweet sauce with bits of green onion. Yum.  A bit of a tip if you do decide to check this place out: go on a Sunday. Not only are domestic beers and highballs on special, but all appetizers (including the aforementioned chicken) and time on the pool tables are all half price. Pretty hard to beat.  All in all, not a bar I can see anybody running out to rave about to their friends, but if you're in the area, and want to shoot a game or two or head out for some pub food on a weekend, it's a pretty solid option.  I just pray for your sake you don't end up like me, stuck there on a day when one guy dominates the jukebox with a taste for strictly early 90s country.  (#10 of 100 for the Yelp 100 Challenge!)"}
{"text":"Ryan K from 2012 was right on. Four years later and the music is to loud, and awful. The waitress' clothing was highly inappropriate and the people beside us were obviously over served.   Sadly I had to spend an hour here; because that's how long it took to get our wing... On wings night!   Jon Taffer, you need to help this place out! How it made it four years since the first year will continue to be a mystery to me.   The wings did taste ok... When they finally arrived. Though they cost more that what was posted on the menu.   Don't come here unless you literally have no other options... Actually still... Just go home... You'll thank me."}
