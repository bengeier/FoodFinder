{"text":"I was in and out of the terminal A location in under 20min. The service was quick and the food acceptable. It was much milder than I prefer my Mexican food, but a safe bet before a 5hr flight. A bit over priced, but that's expected in an airport."}
{"text":"If old dehydrated Mexican food with watered down salsa, and hard tortillas from the .99 store is your thing, then this is the place to go! If you must eat close to your terminal I highly recommend the Burger King. You'll know exactly what to expect."}
{"text":"The food is sooooooo bad, everything is from pre cooked from supermarket.  No wonder they don't pit pic on their menu:)"}
{"text":"Do not go here for breakfast. Weak coffee, not sure what was scrambled on my plate as it didn't taste or have the texture of eggs, potatoes soggy and bacon had a chemical taste. Just go to Starbucks - you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"If you have time head to terminal 4 for much better options. Taco's were ehhh. Margarita not very good at all. Will not eat here again. If you have to eat in this terminal go to Wendy's or don't eat at all."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Waited long time to get recognized. Was brought coffee when I ordered tea. Breakfast was poor quality. Eggs cold. Potatoes cold. Bread was stiff and room temperature. Bacon was tasty. I should have gone across hall to Wendy's like my wife did."}
{"text":"Options are limited so I usually chose this over Wendys. It's a decent burrito for $10. They'll put the guacamole and sour cream inside if you ask. Today's sauce was a bit spicier than usual but still good."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  We ordered delicious chips with homemade guac - excellent and from real avocados.  We then asked for a side of Carnita to put on top and they said \"no problem\".  The Carnita (pork) was absolutely awesome.  We so enjoyed our cold brews while waiting for our plane.  Beth was our bartender and was super cool and even changed the channel to the Apple Cup.  Only bad news was Cougs lost (out QB was out on injury).  I would for sure go back.  I loved their chips - they were not the icky commercial kind - tasted homemade.  Thank you for great service and yummay fixins!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the \"Roasted chicken\" nachos. I've never seen roasted chicken with air holes. It looked like the worst turkey loaf I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"I know options are limited at the PHX airport but these servers are the worst and shouldn't have the luxury of a job.  They are rude, the food is way below average and expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Not that great but it is between this place Wendy's and Starbucks in terminal 3. So if you want booze this is your only option. Chips were stale and salsa had zero flavor and resembled ketchup. Again this is the only show in town (aka terminal 3)."}
{"text":"I had a margarita with my meal and it didn't seem to have any alcohol in it, not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is awful. They are a tequila bar but don't even offer a cocktail list. They don't even list the price of the house margarita (\"like 11 and change or something\" when i asked the bartender) in the menu. The food is terrible. This is the only bar in terminal 3. I suggest you get a camomile as a nightcap when trapped in this abysmal terminal."}
{"text":"Well,  I have officially found a bar that can thoroughly mess up something simple such as a house margarita.  Waitress would rather be anywhere other than work, bad attitude, bad (NASTY) margarita, placed order for food,  waitress never put order in, said we never ordered food.   So NEVER, EVER, EVER,  go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was going to go to Wendy's based on these reviews,  but I decided to give it a go. I was happy I did. Is it airport food. ..of course!  Was it super fast. ...soooooo fast!  The salsa was great, and so was my chicken quesadilla...the very best part of my experience was hands down,  the service. The guy was out going and cheery to every guest in his presence. He was accommodating,  funny and FAST!  I was super happy that I decided against Wendy's.  Terminal 3 doesn't have a lot of options,  but this one was one that I wouldn't mind having again! They get the extra star just for this guy! Bruce, you're a ROCK STAR!"}
{"text":"First off, I don't get pleasure on trashing places but I thought I'd leave a review since there wasn't one to inform travelers at Sky Harbor. Id rather have ordered Wendy's breakfast over this. Big mistake! I'm not sure that the carne asada steak is even real meat and I was served old and cold potatoes not to mention the generic batch of scrambled eggs is your only option. My server did bring me some fresh potatoes which was pretty much my breakfast. No complaints with my server though. She was very pleasant and even gave me 10% off which was appreciated. If you're hungry in the morning hours waiting for your flight, I suggest you find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted."}
{"text":"Management needs to give these people some help. One waitress for half the room and one bartender for a full bar. Poor guy was sweating and losing customers because he couldn't handle it all."}
{"text":"Please save urself some time and money... Skip this place if ur looking for food. At least breakfast... I've had better breakfast at 7-Eleven! At 2am! Drinks are OK, but how hard is it to make a mixed drink... Pass this place by and u will be a lot happier... Sorry to be so blunt, but it is what it is... And not cheap. I know it's airport food, but come on, how hard is it to scramble some eggs to order... And not leave in a steam pan for 3 days, and bacon? Can't really call that bacon."}
{"text":"A Mexican place that doesn't understand that you do not serve salsa in tiny cups that are too small to dip chips in.  That's what I call \"Mexican't\"."}
{"text":"Embarrassing! I don't know where to start. I got the fish tacos and a Diet Coke for $22. OK, it's an airport. It was served on a disposable plate with plastic utensils. Tiny spot of beans were cold and obviously canned. Rice was cold and flavorless, like Uncle Ben's. Tacos were in thin and hardening flour tortillas with a sliver of fried fish, some slaw and absolutely drenched in the most dreadful mayonnaise based sauce (mostly like thousand island burger sauce). Disgusting. No time to complain (my flight was  boarding), but I actually felt sorry for the server that this is his job. Lots of people drinking, they should stick to that and not pretend to be a restaurant. I should have eaten at Wendy's - at least I know what to expect from them."}
{"text":"Service was fast and courteous. Food was subpar. Potatoes were good, but toast and bacon were terrible. Eggs were OK. Wouldn't return to this place."}
{"text":"Yelp never fails...So we should have checked out Yelp before walking in this place. Seriously terrible food. We ordered nachos and taco salad (because really....how can you mess that up?) The chicken wasn't real chicken. A majority of the chips were stale. The melted cheese was cold. The salad dressing was warm. I would have asked for the nachos to be re-heated, but we didn't see our waitress again for about 20 minutes. {However when we did see our waitress, she was nice.  They were busy and understaffed.} By the time all was done, I had paid almost $20 for the nachos and a bottle of water, and was literally sad as I signed the receipt knowing it was such a waste of money. Don't waste your time, money, or daily calories."}
{"text":"Sorry - this is my first one star review.  I very seldom do not find something I like about a place - but the only thing I could find I liked at this place was a Dos-Equis Amber draft.  

I had a two hour wait until my plane was schedule to depart, and decided to have a beer and watch one of the baseball playoff games.  I really didn't expect much - I had already eaten, and simply wanted to kill time for a couple of hours. 

Service - No stars!! The bartender was surly, not just to me but to all of his customers.  I never saw him smile, talk, or express any emotion other than slapping drinks in front of his customers, and acting like he was angry at the world.

Food - No stars!! The people next to me ordered nachos, chips, and some kind of chicken dish.  They were served with plastic cups of hot sauce, guacamole, and in plastic baskets. The food appearance was unappetizing, and ridiculous for the price.  How do I know they were bad? The people left the food uneaten after several tastes, and went next door to another eatery. 

Beer - One star!!  You can't ruin Dos Equis, so I will give them one star. If I could take that one away, I would - just for the surliness of the bartender.

So if you are going to stop here before your plane takes off - do not sit at the bar, and do not order food. You may be lucky and get a friendly waitress - but there were none in sight when I was there."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for an airport eatery.  Sure did not experience the poor service that shows up u=in some of the reviews."}
{"text":"The fryer was broken so no chips. In a Mexican restaurant. No chips. The lettuce was wilted, quesadilla bland. Service was nice but slow. Their best margarita was AWFUL! So bad I couldn't drink it. Super sour. And when I complained they did not remove from my bill. Worst airport restaurant ever. Don't let the cute Mexican decor fool you. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Horrible service, keep using as a waiter the dude that talks likes he's still in the military and eventually your customers will find other alternatives."}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I had in Phoenix. I usually don't expect much of airport food and I understand that it is more expensive that food almost anywhere else. But this was absurd. Really bland food, ridiculously expensive beer, and just a bad experience. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Plentiful outlets! Hard to find at many airport restaurants.   Yes, the food is just mediocre/edible; I'm not sure there are many restaurants at an airport that offer anything else.  The three quesadillas dish is a great option to share ($10).  They make their margaritas with three shorts ($11).  A-Okay is right."}
{"text":"I expect a low level of quality and overpriced food at the airport but this is a new low. The chicken tastes like it was microwaved until it was inedible then served with a layer of cheese.  Better off somewhere else"}
{"text":"Hard rice, oversalted steak and a limited menu -- what more could you ask for? :-/

I ate at the bar, and my bartender was friendly and efficient ... no bad-service reports here. 

But this is a restaurant last I checked, and I'm amazed at how they're able to get away with such bad food. Oh, yes, that's right. It's because this terminal has no other options!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but the service is terrible every time I come here. I always catch the red eye flight and the restaurant is always packed at least 2 hours before the 11:30pm flight but they always insist on having only 2 waitresses and one bartender. I wish the restaurant owner would get it together and realize that just because you are the only late night restaurant in the terminal doesn't mean you can just piss customers off and give bad service."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. The service is absolutely awful. The margaritas sucked. Food was so cold and chips were stale. We will probably end up with food poisoning from this disgusting restaurant before the night is up."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good... Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but seeing as it is an airport restaurant I can't complain. 

This review is mainly for our sever, Carol. She was the BEST! Super nice and attentive. My favorite thing though, was when I asked if their key lime pie was good (my favorite dessert) she gave me an honest answer and told me no. Servers survive on tips. Ideally, the bigger the meal, the higher the tip. By telling me the truth about the key lime pie she risked a lesser tip for honest service. LOVE that! If you go here.. Make sure you ask for her. 

(And to clarify, she definitely got a higher tip than she probably would have gotten if I had ordered the pie :))"}
{"text":"One star is a gift. 10 minutes plus and no drink order and the place was not busy. The only place this restaurant can continue to exist is terminal 3 of Sky Harbour. I've been here many times (the only place you can be \"served\" in terminal 3) and it is always slow and the people are never friendly."}
{"text":"I'm sure I've had the worse Margarita I've ever had in my entire life.  It honestly taste like Margarita mix, lime juice, and salt.  Notice I mentioned nothing about the taste of alcohol right? Right!  Because I don't think it existed.  I ordered the \"Grand\" Margarita which was supposed to have 100% Agave Tequila and Grand Marnier.  I'm not sure what I actually received. This heavily concentrated Margarita cost me $17.95.  That horrible, extremely expensive Margarita cost most than some of the entrees, more than a salad - both of which I did not try but you get my point. That's the cost of an ENTIRE bottle of Tequila.  I'll NEVER return and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, anywhere, at any time.  What in the hell?!"}
{"text":"Super quick, super expensive, and not good at all- almost a sad At-home attempt to create your own chipotle burrito. Salsas in little cups tasted weird. Save your money!!"}
{"text":"10-3-2012 - The food wasn't bad but the service was. Quality and speed were terrible-especially for a place where they know you are in a hurry to catch a plane."}
{"text":"Just when you think airport food is improving-along comes Taberna Del Tequileria. Blue corn quesidilla with pork so dry I had to drown it in salsa (in the stupid little cups - like another reviewer pointed out) in order to choke it down. 

$10 'house' maragarita, come on-it was a flavorless glass of ice slush...

Glad to get back to my 'home' airport (PDX) where they have real restauranteurs running their own places that take pride in what they serve!"}
{"text":"Not bad but very commercialized....would be nice to have authentic here at the airport. I'm sure that's to much to ask in this fast paced environment.  Beer was great!"}
{"text":"The worst food and service I've ever had. The server was reluctantly friendly but very busy. It was like eating at Denny's after leaving the club. Food thrown together to make a sale."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a one star review but my experience was awful. I get that this is a restaurant in an airport terminal so there's a constant flow of customers and maybe because of this they don't care to focus on customer service... I'm just hoping my server, Sunni, was having an off night. I am catching a red eye and I am sleepy and I am hungry and my flight is delayed. She never came back and then never came back and then I didn't get to eat anything. This is a hard one not to recommend because the only alternative is a closing magazine stand.

Sunni! I get you are busy and hey I have had jobs I have hated too (I heard you and the server behind me talking while I tried to get your attention). 

But I'm starving and now I don't have time to order. At least I caught up on the news."}
{"text":"We decided to go here since there wasn't much to choose from (wendy's is across from here but wasnt in the mood for it). The food  was not anything exciting. I got the shrimp tacos. I didn't care for the tortillas nor the rice. The shrimp was alright, they just grilled it no seasoning at all. And the guacamole looked very unappealing. Overall I was disappointed in the quality of the food, but the service was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I would pass, had difficulty finding a clean place to sit.  Found a semi clean spot, when the waiter arrived he cleaned the table top by whining his had across the surface which is gross. Good thing all I had was a beer which came in a can"}
{"text":"I think they should put a sign up front that you can seat yourself so new customers don't look slow lol
The service was pretty slow and I understand that it's busy, but that's why you hire staff that can handle the busy pressure of the business. 
The staff were very nice and I got a double order of my usual vodka pineapple. I also ordered the Las Wing, which were spicy. My sinuses opened up immediately as soon as my food came. My server took forever to pick up my signed receipt so I left it at the bar and went to the bathroom and then went to my gate. She chased me down and said she didn't have a signed copy. I told her I left it at the bar and she had me sign again. It was unusual but unfortunately this was the only place at my gate that served alcohol. 
Ehhh, MAYBE I'd come back but hopefully there's Bette options and service next time."}
{"text":"In Terminal 3, it's this or Wendy's. That's why this place is packed, you wait for a table, and then you're elbow-to-elbow with the people at the next table. 

I ordered the shredded chicken tacos and asked for salsa verde. The tacos were lukewarm and bland and arrived with the standard red salsa in a little plastic cup with a lid on it, along with a set of plastic flatware, some black beans, and rice. The beans tasted like plain black beans out of a can. The rice was plain white rice. They desperately needed some flavor, so I tried the red salsa; all heat and no flavor, not good. I waited for the server to return and check on me so that I could get the green salsa I ordered.

And waited. And waited. And waited. She walked by twice to deal with other tables and I tried to catch her eye; no luck. I put down the utensils and sat there and stared at her: nothing. Waved. \"Excuse me...\" Nothing. 

Finally I gave up and marched up to the bar, where she was standing there chatting with the bartender, and asked if I could please get the salsa verde. 

A few minutes later she drops by my table and sets a little plastic cup of salsa verde on my plate. It's half full. There's no lid. Salsa is dripping over the edge. There are bits of green onion and queso blanco stuck to the sides. It's fairly obvious that she plucked it off the plate of some other diner who had finished their meal.

Terrible food and worse service."}
{"text":"We were hungry and everything else was closed near our gate (except Wendy's, which doesn't count as food in my book), so we ate some chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  My expectations were low, so I wasn't surprised to be unimpressed.
The chips came in three colors - Yellow #5, Blue #1, and natural corn color.  The salsa was completely pureed - no chunks at all.  It was more like hot sauce.  Ugh.  The guacamole was pretty flavorless.  This is not my kind of food.
The service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport, however."}
{"text":"Pretty rough. Bloody Mary tasted awful so I sent it back. Food was ok...the stench coming from behind the bar didn't help though.

At the end of the day, there are some GREAT restaurants in this airport. Skip this place. Go to Chelsea's Kitchen. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Here's another sucky airport bar with crappy food.  I ordered the nachos as they only had a few food items on their menu.  They sucked!  They were wet and flavorless. Make sure to ask up front to separate alcohol on your check.  I asked when the waitress brought me the beer I ordered and she told me they were already on one check.  WTF?  Go back and separate them then!  I will not be back here.  If you are looking for food before your flight I suggest stopping off before you reach the airport."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is the pits. The only pro here is that the staff was very friendly.

Now, on to the cons:

I've eaten a lot of airport food in my time and I know not to have very high expectations. However, this place was just downright gross. Service was incredibly slow, our waitress seemed highly overwhelmed and it was difficult to order or get our check.

We ordered 2 cocktails, guacamole, chicken tacos, and a caesar salad. Our disappointing meal came out to about $70....seriously. The drinks were overly sugary and I have a sneaking suspicion they were missing the alcohol. The guac was ok, but served piled on a tray of chips and topped with an overwhelming amount of sweet pickled onions. The chicken on both the salad and the tacos was exactly the same, some sort of rubbery meat that tasted fake and seemed like it had been pre-cooked and then microwaved. The tacos were served on undercooked tortillas and topped with about half a cup of sour cream. The salad was made up of sad wilted romaine and came with a very underwhelming dressing. 

Avoid this place, it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Skip it. Walk to terminal 4. The whole restaurant smells like a college bar at 4am with that dank stale beer smell. Service is not great. Food even worse. Mine came out cold and the only solution was to microwave it. Also the plates are styrofoam and forks are plastic. Unpleasant experience and money poorly spent"}
{"text":"I know, I know its airport food. We'll the food was just bad, and that's all I really have to say about that."}
{"text":"Our server was fabulous. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the two cocktails my wife and I ordered. Her margarita was undrinkable and my mango margarita tasted like sunny delight. I would advise to not drink here and based upon the other reviews eating here sounds just as bad. Just a quick add here. The two margaritas were $26. WTF?"}
{"text":"My travel companion and I stopped in to get a buzz because we saw the same family with small children waiting for the same flight we're out on - and the one we came in on. He ordered a Margarita as did I, but apparently I said something different because the two are not the same. Mine tasted like it was made with sweet and sour mix and his with actual lime/lemon juice. I'll be switching to the draft beers after I manage to choke this one on down. As for food we had a huge breakfast but the items coming from the kitchen look good, but be prepared to pay that airport price premium."}
{"text":"My sister and I ordered margaritas. Server ID'ed us and refused to serve my sister because she has a vertical ID. She is 25. He suggested my sister \"do the adult thing\" and get a new drivers license. He then proceeded to inform us that if he saw her take a sip of my drink, he would kick us out and call the cops. Remember, she's 25. 

Now then. We looked up the law he was referring to and it was changed effective April 2016 so that it no longer applies to out of state drivers licenses. Not only was he incorrect about the law, he was a jerk about it too. The food was mediocre and overpriced-- both of which are forgivable in an airport-- rudeness and ignorance of the law when all a weary traveler wants is a mixed drink is not!"}
{"text":"This place is no good. Unfortunately the only place to eat.  For the price you'd think it was 4 Star at the least."}
{"text":"Just a terrible experience.  I mean, who expects much at an airport, right?  Early morning; not even crowded, slow service.  Coffee tasted like yesterday, nothing healthy and the eggs are all powdered scrambled.  Stay away.  Issue is, Delta gates 15-26 are serviced by this one sit down restaurant.  There is nothing else.  I will fly American now when traveling in and out of PHX;  cannot believe Delta allows this type of food service offerings in their boarding gate wing."}
{"text":"I am a fearful flyer, so was looking forward to having a couple of drinks before boarding.   I arrived around 8:00pm last night which was a Saturday and the whole place was dark.   I was so disappointed that they just decided to close early and there was nowhere else to go.   I just read their hours are to close at 10:00 so something fishy was going on.   When I spoke to the HMS on duty, about where to get alcohol, he told me there was a cafe, but they monitor your drinks on weight and height and I only qualified for two beers in a one hour period.    This terminal and restaurant are a joke."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give zero stars? The $14 tacos are inedible. The beans were OVER salted. The rice was still crunchy and also over salted. If there was a Taco Bell at the airport I would have eaten that. Save your money and get a Snickers bar"}
{"text":"Not the BEST Mexican food I've ever had, but this was the best, non-fast food option I could find in terminal C at the Phoenix airport.

My tamales, beans and rice were good but could have been better. The service was fast--I bet they are used to serving customers who need to eat quickly."}
{"text":"My family and I went here while waiting for our flight and regretted it. The food and drinks were not good at all and poorly made. Only time I ever ordered and enchilada, and didn't get enchilada sauce on it. 

Our waitress was also very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"People c'mon. It's airport food. It was fast, hot and had some flavor. I wouldn't say it's great Mexican food but it was decent. Giving it four stars to balance out the over critical."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10pm  tired and hungry. Ordered dis Equis. Out of it. Ordered house Chardonnay. Out of it. ..... Ok I will have the good Chardonnay at the house wine price. Nope. Wtf."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. My food tasted like it was someone else's but they didn't want it so they gave it to me. It was not even warm, chewy bacon, and basically buffet style eggs. My server was nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Airport joint, super busy \"ok\" service, food was just ok- price a little high. I had the taco salad with chicken. About the same quality as Taco Bell. Had to ask for refills on ice tea... the call button on the table didn't work either. New wing of the airport will replace this restaurant - looking forward to better restaurant options in the near future."}
{"text":"Good place to wait for a relay. It was packed and had a long line because it's the only sit in bar around. The line moved quick enough for me to catch a few beers before boarding. Nice bar and bartender was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant and there were no seats available. As I was leaving to move on, the waitress pulled me back inside and had me sit at the same table as traveling couple- strangers. I hope they didn't mind. 
The food seemed fairly priced for an airport restaurant. I ordered the tacos and a 20 oz Pyramid beer. After quite a while, my food appeared. The pulled pork tacos lacked lettuce and tomatoes, as stated on the menu. The melted cheese threw me off as well. Then I got the bill.  The waitress ordered me quesadillas instead of tacos. This was after she repeated my correct order 2x and claimed she was so good at waitressing she didn't have to write anything down. The quesadillas were also much more expensive than the tacos I had ordered. I would have complained but the waitress was MIA for most of my meal. The 'tacos' were actually very tasty and the beer was good as well. I hope the other 2 random people I was sat with had correct meals because they also had lousy service."}
{"text":"Shit food!! And poor menu. A huge disappointment as the Phoenix airport is know for having such great food selections. Sadly all those food options are in terminal 4. If you are unfortunate enough to be traveling through terminal 3, head this warning! You will not have many food options and this place is the only sit down place currently in operation. The food is awful! And their \"choice or option\" is not really that. You can either get 3 tacos, A quesadilla, or A burrito. No mixing or matching allowed. And if you only wanted say 1 taco, forget it not allowed. You HAVE to order the the full 3 taco option ranging from $12-17. 
Terminal 3 traveler find somewhere else!! Trust me!"}
{"text":"yummy airport food and texmex, food, tequila, dang i dont have time for a full reveiw but if you in this airport around gate a19 then stop in and have a drink and some food woot!"}
{"text":"Had a lengthy wait so stopped here to have a Margarita. . Good Margarita for airport bar.. Sunny was my server and she was excellent.. she was attentive and I enjoyed chatting with her during my brief stay.. 

Recommend... yes!!!"}
{"text":"Wow thought this place would be better food option than Wendys, was i wrong and paid twice as much. At least you know what your getting at starbucks and wendys, never again worst enchiladas ever"}
{"text":"Good drinks. Friendly staff and great nachos!!!!! Perfect place to hang and watch the game when you're waiting to board your flight."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Do not order the coffee here-- it's the worst I've ever had. Burnt and rancid flavor. Nasty. Our server took it off the bill, mentioning how many people complain about their horrible coffee. You've been warned. 
The eggs are powdered eggs -- your first clue is they only serve scrambled eggs. My partner got the carne asada egg burrito which he said was good. The scrambled egg breakfast wasn't so great. 
You'd be better off at Starbucks with a good coffee and muffin!"}
{"text":"We split a breakfast burrito, which had a decent chorizo flavor, but the egg was fake and not very appetizing. The salsa was not good at all and we were afraid to eat it after visual inspection. I also felt a bit sick afterwards and this was the only thing I ate. Chili's express might be a better choice for airport dining."}
{"text":"There isn't much to offer for food in this terminal. If you are sick of burgers/fries and you don't really feel like a day-old saran wrap sandwich then this is pretty much your only hope. 

But it sucks so much here. The service is so slow. So slow. So so so slow. Man, I don't get it. This is an airport, folks. Every single customer here has a flight to catch. Can you hustle a bit? 

I ordered the chimichanga. It sucked. Tasted like a really awful egg roll. The rice tasted like invisible flavor nothingness. Beans were slosh. Service was sh*t. I was so irritated after waiting 88 hours just to flag down my server. 

Should have stopped at the newspaper stand for that saran wrap sandwich instead. ugh."}
{"text":"Super unfriendly place!!!!! Pay for rudeness? No thank you !!!!! Bartender actually told to find another place as they can't service now with empty restaurant??????"}
{"text":"In a pinch the food is edible, but it's far from good. The chicken fajita bowl had plain rice, a few onions & peppers, and some very boring chicken. Also, the \"Express\" side is anything but. As I waited 15 minutes for my to-go order - it would've been longer if I hadn't asked and they realized my ticket got lost - a fellow customer said they had been on the restaurant side and had to cancel their order after waiting 30 minutes and being told it would not be done anytime soon. Why they couldn't just package up their order instead of making them wait again on the Express side is beyond me. 15 and 30 minutes may not seem like much, but in an airport restaurant that is WAY too long."}
{"text":"Read a lot of soso reviews on this place but I have to say my experience was pretty good. We seated ourselves and there were plenty since it was early. Matt our server was on it and had our order and beverages quick. He had a great attitude for being so early too. My breakfast burrito with chorizo was really good!  The potatoes were not though. Overall a pretty great experience for breakfast"}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 chicken soft tacos.....so bland and dry I poured salsa all over to help but even then it wasn't so palatable. I probably ate half of one of them. The Mexican rice was gross..how do you manage that?! And the black beans were so salty. 
The outside of the restaurant fools you...it looks nice but inside you get really bad food. 
Drinks are soooo expensive. I ordered a $12 margarita which was good but I can't imagine any margarita being worth that. Wish I'd checked yelp before coming here...wish I'd gone to Pizza Hut instead....
Total price of bad food, an overpriced drink, and decent service for one is $28. Makes me sick this \"restaurant\" is in business!"}
{"text":"Awful. Huevos Rancheros.  You know those tortillas that look like frisbees and are so tough and durable you can cut glass with them? Try breaking through with your plastic fork!  Throw on a tablespoon of refried beans, some over cooked scramble egg product that resembles large cottage cheese with no flavour, a sprinkle of cojita cheese, and add a tablespoon of salsa.  Huevos Rancheros.  I know it's an airport but good lord! Added a soda ($3.19) and three pieces of bacon and you've got yourself the most forgettable $20 breakfast I've ever had. I travel a lot. I expect the $$ - and possibly some quality issues... but this is inexcusable.  On the Beans... server had to help me find them - I thought they had been forgotten- customer next to me said she should have warned me - she did the same thing!  Server was obviously shamed... she must get this a lot. Scurried off as quick as she could.  I was offered a side of beans but she left before I could answer. Glad she did, I suspect it would have been 3 TBSP of product ... $2.99 - glad I didn't find out. Save yourself time, money, and have a better experience.  Check out Wendy's across the hall."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but at an airport that's expected. I had the Big Blue burrito sans meat (only vegitarian option was on their breakfast menu which they stop serving at 10:30). It was big enough to share.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Even though the burrito was plenty big, don't expect many chips - I think I got about 5."}
{"text":"I waited over a year to re-try this place. The theory was: If they stayed in business this long maybe they've fixed things. The menu is better with more selections. Service is slow which doesn't mix well with airport crowds. There are too many tables per sq foot and people consistently walk into table. 

Good place to go if the world runs out of restaurants.

Food was 2 star
Service 1 star
Ambiance 1 star, (because zero isn't permitted)"}
{"text":"The tacos were dry and lacked any flavor. Service was okay. I would not recommend this restaurant. I wanted white queso as the menu displayed but they did not have it. I was very disappointed with my meal"}
{"text":"Average restaurant, nothing great but nothing terrible. Food was fine service was excellent considering we are in an airport. Got the tacos Mexican style, they were just okay. It filled me up enough for a long flight!"}
{"text":"Imagine a jolly rancher melted down and put into a glass with a salted rim and a taco salad from a place one rung below Taco Bell and you have in your mind a taco salad and margarita from Tequileria.  

Total damage...$27 ($12 margarita, $10 taco salad, $4 tip).

-1 stars for the food and +3 stars for above average airport atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't do five stars because it's rare to be that good. Four stars doesn't mean the best, either

This place is kind of like a mini Acapulco themed restaurant and bar with fancy artwork. I got the chicken nachos because the picture someone took made them look so good

In the span of half an hour I ate my nachos and had a nice beer in a chill environment with classic rock playing and a cute waitress

It's amazing how being on *this side* of the restaurant gives you a sense of being in a totally different place than the walkway in the airport outside

Can you ask for more? Price ~ $20"}
{"text":"After all the reviews trashing this place --much to my surprise I liked the chicken taco salad!  Guacamole was tasty. Also restaurant was calm and not too noisy.  Nice respite from the airport.  Service was also good and overall I was glad I went in."}
{"text":"Don't believe the rating, my experience was awesome. Shauna was my server and she killed it. The service was fast and friendly, kind and accommodating, and never went with less than half a glass of that fine goose island IPA. 10/10 would return just for the guacamole lol"}
{"text":"For airport food we were impressed! I love salsa and the salsa rocks- the green and red have so many wonderful flavors. I had a steak quesadilla and smothered it in that spicy red salsa. My husband loved the carnitas tacos where he loaded them with that yummy salsa.  It was the perfect dinner before heading back home. I don't get the bad reviews we thought it was really delicious. Our service was great too!"}
{"text":"Garbage. Essence of bad airport food. I should have eaten Wendy's across the way. I wanted more if a sit down meal so I came here. Food was out in about 1 minute....thats because it was obviously premade in large batches. Eggs were horrible.... they remind me of the reconstituted dehydrated eggs served in cafeterias. And they were cold and dry. Only thing good I can say is its quick and the diet Coke tastes like Diet Coke, but that is the case everywhere. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Gross.  The chicken fajitas was a pile of undercooked onions with an unseasoned chicken breast cut up.  No cheese, no sour cream, mix of tomato/onions/cilantro as a side.  Tortillas that tasted freezer-burnt.  I'd bypass and get a smoothie or cheese plate from the bookstore. Or Wendy's.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Stopped into this airport spot to kill time while waiting on a flight. I sat at the bar and Paul was my bartender. I ordered a glass of wine that was not what it was described to be and Paul was all about? customer service and was happy to replace it despite me saying that would not be necessary. I had the tortilla soup which was not too bad... pretty standard, but nothing to write home about. Overall this Mexican spot is a generic airport watering hole, but Paul's attitude, personality, and attention to detail when it comes to customer service took my experience to a \"whole nother\" level. Well done! Four stars it is!"}
{"text":"Worst Huevos Rancheros I have ever had. It was 2 tostada shells with scrambled eggs on top with a little salsa. There was not even any beans on it. I really do not know how they can even call these huevos rancheros. This place is expensive with bad food."}
{"text":"I know not to expect much out of airport food but I was hoping for more out of this place.  Sadly it is slim pickings in this terminal so you have very few choices if you are hungry.  The server was not very attentive, not good if you are in a rush.  The menu is very very very small.  The food was decent, but I have had much much better in other airports."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars! The food was almost as bad as the service. We waited for our waitress, Consuelo, to get off the phone to take our order. 6:30pm, I hope the morning staff is better then night staff... in the name of Jesus, amen."}
{"text":"I came to have a drink before my flight and sat at the bar. The bar had open seats so I moved one out of the way so I could put my laptop and cary on next to me. A lady came out and told me I could not move the empty chair and must either put my cary on behind me or on the other side of the walkway. Either way I could not see my stuff and someone could easily walk away with it.  I am giving it 1 star for the service and hopefully the food will be decent, so one star for that."}
{"text":"This is a relatively good looking restaurant for an airport location in PHX. Unfortunately, the appearance should not fool you - the staff here all lag around and rarely come help you. After 15 minutes of sitting down, I decided to move to the bar and got much faster service. The margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as \"1800\" tequila. The restaurant actually smells kind of fishy and like dirty dishwater, but it seems overall pretty clean. As for the food, it's not absolutely horrible, but my enchiladas were sub-par for sure. Obviously, it's an airport place, but the chicken seemed like reheated grilled chicken strips and the tortillas were dry with a strange relish looking \"salsa verde.\" I wasn't appalled, but it's not the best option here. I only did it because the other choices were Wendy's and Starbucks."}
{"text":"I struggle a bit with the stars and rating, and following is why.  Terminal 3 \"dining\" is abysmal.  (Terminal 4 = amazing).  Your choice is basically this place, Wendy's, Starbucks, or whatever you can dig out of your purse.  So if you need a pre-flight adult beverage, you're saddling up here.  (First star).  Our service was great - in sharp contrast to other reviews.  Quick, friendly, attentive.  (Second star.)  We didn't eat, so I can't speak to the food (Out of fairness, third star because I looked at the menu, and was enticed, despite the seeming airport high prices.)  Other thoughts/comments - the place was clean, and seemed overstaffed because many servers were hanging around chatting.  The bartender kept a clean bar, and promptly cleaned spots and arranged chairs to be inviting.  I had ONE Bloody Mary, and was offered a choice of Absolut, Kettle One, Tito's, Sky, etc., no house Vodka mentioned.  Choice was mild, medium or spicy - and I opted for medium, which was quite spicy.  Lemon, lime and celery (you always get bonus points from me if you serve it with celery).  Booooooooooo - served a double and wasn't told or asked, so blissfully and stupidly enjoyed a $14.00 drink.  Nope, not a typo.  Nope, not pleased.  Nope, not worth it.  Nope, not going back.  (Small fib - next time, I'll just order a beer.)  This place has an accidental and exclusive captive audience if you want a drink in Terminal 3.  Sadly, the $8 Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad from Wendy's, across the hall, sucked worse."}
{"text":"I am far from picky, but this place is bad. The food was terrible...so bland. The Bloody Mary was watered down and bitter.. so I tried a strawberry margarita, hoping a Mexican place couldn't mess that up. Wrong. It tasted like they used tequila left over from a college party. The bottom line:don't waste your money here. The food at the Wendy's across from here is probably better."}
{"text":"Not that great Mexican restaurant...in an airport.  The server was really friendly though.

I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, the fish was overly fishy smelling, and it was not served with all the stuff the menu said, no mango salsa, no fresh tomatoes, no cilantro....the best thing was the guacamole I ordered on the side."}
{"text":"The pancakes were hard to cut and my son who eats everything refused to eat them. We were given Plastic utensils! The coffee creamer was poured into a small condiment cup.  Huevos rancheros was not huevos rancheros...it was scrambled eggs and salsa on a fried tortilla. The Bloody Mary was mainly lemon juice. Just don't eat here."}
{"text":"If you are into rubbery, dry chicken, enchiladas without enchilada sauce, stale chips, atrocious 80s metal played too loud over tinny speakers, and food poisoning, this place is you jam. If not (or if you like beans, which somehow they were out of) you should probably avoid terminal 3 while anything remotely close to hungry, since somehow this is the only restaurant past security. I will say the beer tastes like beer, and the waitress looked like she felt sorry for us for eating at such a dump. Still, avoid it like the plague, since you might actually get it."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill before catching our flight so we decided to stop in for a margarita. Big mistake. We realize that prices are higher in airports but these were way over the top. In addition the service was really bad and all our server cared about was her tip.  Hint - don't tell your customer that the reason you can't split the bill between two cards is because it messes up the tip."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for break fast before our lunch. There were five of us and only actable for four so I asked grabbed a chair at the bar, which was right next to our table, and the bartender named Art told me to put the chair back and that I could not move the chair. I thought he was joking at first but he as serious. So my niece asked what our options are and he was rude. Seriously?! The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one was because our server Jennifer was not bad. There was absolutely no need to Art to be rude and if he didn't want us to move a chair, he should have offered an alternative instead of just starring at us. Not being able to move a chair in a restaurant is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard! Stay away from this place. Especially from Art."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences , it was the only open restaurant at the airport and nothing was up to the standards of a half star restaurant... no food menu !! Only appetizers ( nachos and thags it) , drinks were served in unclean glasses ....ets ....it was the only option .... will definitely close if any other place will open soon ...."}
{"text":"We just stopped in while waiting for our flight back to JAX after ten wonderful, amazing days in AZ. We had a fun bubbly waitress that was eager to share about the GRAND FALLS, also known as Melting Chocolate, Chocolate Falls or Mud Falls is northeast of Flagstaff, AZ in the Painted Desert. Which I am very sad to say we missed this trip. We had been an hour away when we stayed at the Twin Arrow Casino. Shaking my head that I had not known of this beautiful place. SO...back to the TDT review.. 

We just drank but the Margaritas were good, fairly prices at just under $9 bucks a pop(cheaper then so many places we had stopped at along our journey). The food coming out looked good and was quick (as it is a rush rush airport kind of need) 

I would so recommend this place if you are flying out of Phx Sky Harbor. We were flying Delta Terminal 3 gate 25 for point of reference."}
{"text":"Wish we would have read reviews before having breakfast here.  This place is nasty!  Bacon is so thin you can see through it and it tastes like shoe leather.  Toast is stale and potatoes are cold.  Only hung edible are scrambled eggs, and I doubt they're real."}
{"text":"Hello my friends on Yelp!  I had some time to kill in the little terminal 3 here in Phoenix, this place was really the only sit down place so I tried it despite the reviews. 

I ordered their ultimate margarita and it came out fast.  It was not good, but quick. My server was very attentive so I can only hope they have learned something from all the poor reviews.   

I then ordered the tortilla soup, it also came out fast, and it was good.  I went one step further and ordered the chicken quesadilla, Mexican way.  It too came out fast and was good.  They served it the American way, but the server noticed and corrected it before I could even say anything. The server was Yunjung and she was very good. 

This is a cool looking place, big bar and nice tables."}
{"text":"Slowest, dirtiest most inept airport restaurant I've ever been in. I arrived at 12:30.. seated at the table tops.. several of the wait staff walked past me w/o an offer of water or a menu!  It's 12:50.. just got water too late to order anything for fear of not getting it in time for my 1:10 Delta flight.  Booooo!!"}
{"text":"This place is a typical airport Mexican place.  The food is Meh and they mainly serve drinks.  The server was very friendly and that was one of the things I liked about it most.  I was thinking about giving this place a two star due to the good server, however there is one thing that stuck out in a significant way.  There are no plugs in this place.  They have a whole bar area and bar top area along the perimeter and not a single plug to plug any device in.  I take that back.  I saw one plug.  I would not be surprised by thing five years ago, however it todays time you need to have power in an airport.  People can't travel without it and most places are at the minimum retrofitting power strips into the high bar tops areas.  Get with today and install some power so people can be productive during their multiple hour flight delays.  That is all I have to say.  Get plugs."}
{"text":"I loved the carnitas quesadilla!  Excellent flavor. The service was fast and friendly.  

It was pretty busy when i got there the other evening and i was greeted soon after i sat down and served my food and drink not long after i ordered.   

The prices we're a bit high but that's normal for an airport."}
{"text":"This place is so lucky that it's the only non-fast food place in this terminal of Sky Harbor Airport. If there was a better option, we would have gone to that in a heartbeat. 

The place is seat yourself, which we did, but that meant that no one knew we were there until we had been sitting down for 10 minutes. We all ordered drinks and after the server brought them, we had to wave him down to order some food... he was very apathetic about his job which detracts from the experience. 

Good place for a beer at the bar, perhaps. But as a restaurant ... me thinks not."}
{"text":"First Mexican restaurant I've been to where they were out of salsa.   How does that happen?
Service was not good - unpleasant.  
Food was not accurate and lacked flavor.  Eat at the place before security."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm jaded after living in Phoenix for several years, but I was expecting more. This a place you eat at because you have time to kill before a flight, you are hungry, and you want something other than Wendy's. The beans suck, the rice is bland, and the tacos are overpriced. If you are in Phoenix on a layover, please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here. It's a shame too cause the staff here is pretty good. 1 star food, 1 star prices, 4 star staff."}
{"text":"So, I understand that this is an airport restaurant and that you don't have much competition in this terminal (In retrospect, I would have much rather had went to Wendy's), but it is inexcusable for the food to be this bad, in my opinion.

Decor/cleanliness: 3
Nothing to really comment on here.  Nothing bad or anything really remarkable.

Food: 1
Wow!  Where I do I even begin?!  I ordered the shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas and everything about this dish was lacking.  The steak was rubbery and tasteless.  But for a twist, the chicken and steak weren't tasteless at all... They were incredibly salty instead (what a great trade off!) !
The guacamole was just downright disgraceful.  It didn't even look like guacamole, just some watered-down, green paste!  The rice seemed to be of extremely low quality and was just as low in the taste department!  The tortillas were pretty awful as well.  This is definitely one of the worst fajitas meals that I have ever had the displeasure of trying to eat!  I spent a good portion of my plane ride hoping not to get sick!

Service: 2
So, let me get this straight... You serve subpar food and then have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for the privilege of trying to keep it down?!  The prices are ridiculous; even for airport food!  The one saving grace was that our waitress was nice and she checked up on us in a timely fashion.

Overall: 2
 On the whole, we received decent service but, ultimately, the horrible food and high prices led to a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Ok food, crazy expensive drinks.  What can you expect from an airport eatery."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if this place has a one star rating or a five star rating. You will go here  because you are desperate for a pre-flight beer and you want some nachos. That being said, the pork nachos are pretty good. Don't expect it to be cheap, you're at an airport and it the only place in the terminal that serves alcohol. They know the demand is high."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to choose from in Terminal 3 at PHX. This is pretty much the only \"sit down\" restaurant if you don't count Starbucks or other similar places.

They have a few decent beers on tap and a decent selection of southwestern food. The prices were way too high though for what you get. Over $70 for mom, dad, and two kids....to be served food with plastic forks and plastic knives. Too much.

The food tasted decent but was pretty basic. They server was very nice though and the service was fast for us. I am mainly knocking down to two stars for the lack of value here, even for an airport."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. But captive audience and they don't have to care. Can't give a zero review. Which would be well deserved."}
{"text":"The bartender who served me didn't look me in the eye once, was rude, and served me a burrito that was only rice and beans...when I asked to add on what was missing she acted bothered.  I won't be in the area again but if I am I won't come back."}
{"text":"Don't have much luck with Airport restaurants. Rated a 2 because the Burrito was good. Seated first but server took her time to take my order and helped guests who were seated after me. Asked for Sour Cream on the side and wasn't told that a tablespoon size would cost me $2. Someone at another table needed Hot Sauce and another server came to my table and reached over my plate to get the Hot Sauce. No other options in Terminal 3 for meals except this and Wendy's. I should've taken my @ss to Wendy's."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I had to double check if we just ate at the right restaurant. Maybe we were lucky or they read the reviews and improved greatly, but I have not much to complain about.

I had a tortilla soup and churros, the soup was absolutely delicious, very flavorful, and topped with a generous scoop of Guacamole. The  churros had a tad too much cinnamon sugar for my taste, but they were crispy and fresh. 
My fiance really enjoyed his barbacoa pepito.

The service was very friendly and attentive, the food came quick and despite it being busy we weren't rushed to finish. The only small complain I have is that the tables for two are very small, our three plates and two drinks covered it completely and we had to play some tetris to be able to eat. 
The prices are airport prices.... more than you'd pay elsewhere but not overly expensive.

Overall I'd definitely recommend eating at this place."}
{"text":"We have a new winner for the toughest cut of meat I have ever had in a restaurant. The carne asada I was just served is a dentist's dream. I had to stop after one bite or lose some teeth. This was horrible but when they asked about it and I described it as terrible they brought me the full bill. Run from this place, not good!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly... the Bloody Mary was lack luster and then I get the bill for TWO drinks and it's 32.04$ I was told that all the mixed drinks are \"automatically doubles\"!!! B.S."}
{"text":"Expensive menu, food not worth the price. I would go somewhere else if I'm in this terminal again. The service was good, but the monetary value for the food was poor."}
{"text":"Service included plastic tableware thrown on our table.  You do NOT get complimentary chips and salsa.  Fish tacos consisted of frozen fish fillets in cardboard flour tortillas. The retried beans were sticky slimey.  No alcohol and the bill nearly $45.  Unfortunately only other food choices in the area were Wendy's or Starbucks.  You'd do better to choose one of them instead of coming here"}
{"text":"This was the place that was open @ Sky Harbor when no other places were open.  On Terminal 3 near gate 17 (which was nice, my departure gate was 17).  Seats started to open up, and we were starving- I would have eaten scraps on the floor.

We got served fairly quickly, and were able to grabs a few pre-flight brews.  The food came out hot as well.  It didn't taste spectacular, but it was hot and filled us up.  I cannot complain there!

They close around Midnight, so keep that in mind if you have a red-eye flight.

The prices aren't too terrible either (no entree over $10 except special fajitas), and the waitress was pretty accomodating.

I could see this place easily getting slammed!"}
{"text":"Terminal 3 is undergoing some growing pains. As a result, there's very very few eating options after 9PM. There's few before that, too. We had a late-night flight, and having missed dinner, bellied up to a table at Taberna del Tequileria. I'd had tacos from their express station before, and wasn't scared of the low ratings. 

The biggest issue with this restaurant is its service. There's no hostess to seat you. You'll either awkwardly stand there, waiting for a greeting (and never get one), or roll the dice on seating yourself and never getting served. We lucked out, choosing a well-visible table, and our server came over within 5 minutes-- not ideal, but not bad. Another table near us, which had obviously been there for some time before we sat down, wasn't greeted by their server until *our* server notified the other that she had a table, some 5 minutes after we'd already had our order taken.

Menu is very, very limited-- a big disappointment to my husband, who doesn't particularly crave Mexican food. Think tacos, burritos, quesadillas. I ordered 3 carnitas (pork) tacos \"Mexican style\" (cotija cheese, pico de gallo and pickled onions). My husband went with a burrito. There was no \"plain\" bean and cheese burrito on the menu, but he asked the waitress-- who seemed a bit confused-- nevertheless, he ended up getting what he asked for.
Prices are up there, for Mexican food. A combo plate (with limited offerings and unclear side dishes) will cost you $15. They don't list prices for drinks, a sure sign of dollar-bill hemorrhaging. Chips and salsa aren't gratis at the beginning of the meal, standard for any \"good\" Mexican restaurant.

The tacos were \"ok\": carnitas were good, so were the toppings, but the corn tortillas were soggy and falling apart. Rice and beans (apparently) were included as a side, but were terrible-- especially the rice, which was basically parboiled Minute rice. Jamie's bean burrito came with chips and salsa on the side (also not on the menu), and he was quite pleased with his simple meal. Waters were had because, although I wanted a margarita, the prospect of spending $15 on a bottled sweet-n-sour crappy marg turned me off.  

It was a \"bite to eat\", not an experience, and if there was any competition in Terminal 3, Taberna would either have to revamp it's approach, or suffer the consequences. For now, they're safe in the lack of competition."}
{"text":"There was very little to choose from when you are in this area of the airport. It's open seating and that day it was lunch time and very busy. Luckily I was able to grab a table for two and one of the servers helped track down a second seat. Our server was really nice and helped with our order quickly. They brought out our drinks within a few minutes and the food came out shortly after. I was impressed how well the chicken chimichangas tasted. You get two small chicken chimichangas and they were nicely golden brown and very crispy. Great, considering it's airport food!"}
{"text":"Airport food prices for food that is just OK.  The taco salads are very large, and have a lot of meat in them (Choice of chicken or carnitas).  I had the salad with carnitas, which had a nice smokey flavor to the pulled pork.  I didn't see any vegetarian options on the menu, and the menu itself is very limited, consisting of items such as tacos, burritos, and taco salad."}
{"text":"Gross food and High  prices. I swear there was a hair in my food. And i couldn't believe the cost of a crappy drink and crappy nachos.... keep walking and find something else or go to wendys. Maybe I should have used yelp before walking in... just praying the food doesn't hit me bad! Good grief."}
{"text":"This was a painful experience. The wait staff were horrible. If I'm ever in this airport again I will never never never stop here again."}
{"text":"Now I see why this place has such bad reviews.  

While I didn't have any food (thank goodness) the drinks and service were sub par.  

Decided to have a few pre-flight drinks before take off around 8:30am. Wasn't busy by any means and there were three servers along with the bartender to cover.  Once seated we were greeted promptly but after that pretty much on our own.  

Ordered a Bloody Mary which was ok. Seemed more tomato juice than actual mix or alcohol.  Almost V8 like. At least I got my nutrients I guess ( high five ).   Then waited 20 minutes for another drink. After the waitress would not come around we just ordered from the bartender two margaritas.  These were even worse. Tasted of dirty sink water and expired margarita mix. Couldn't taste and tequila.  Pretty much forced it down out of principle since it was 10 freaking dollars.  

Safe to say on my next early flight I'll just stick with coffee from Starbucks."}
{"text":"You have to actively try to be this bad. I spent $28 on a wine + margarita. Thankfully the waitress went missing for the next 40 minutes, or I may have made the mistake of ordering a $16 taco plate. I didn't think I could actually long for airplane food, but this being essentially the only restaurant in terminal 3 made that a frightening reality."}
{"text":"What a joke $7.00 and $8.00 beers common!  I ordered a pork taco, they asked me if I wanted a side of sour cream and guacamole, I should of asked how much - $1.99 for guacamole and $1.29 for sour cream, WHAT!!!  The taco was dry and shell soggy  and I got 5 tortilla chips. Run away as fast as you can from this place! Oh one last point, service was awful!"}
{"text":"Went to the Taberna Express for breakfast. The food was mediocre, but the service was bad. Ordered a breakfast burrito and coffee. Added cream and sugar to the coffee and noticed they don't have coffee stirrers. I asked the woman at the counter if they have stirrers and she said no. Then I moved to the pickup area and the counter was stacked with boxes, so there was no room to put down a bag or your coffee, or pick up your food. Later as I was finishing the coffee, I got a mouthful of grounds in my mouth. I said something about the coffee to the same woman who was now unloading the boxes in the food pickup area and she wouldn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her even though she was standing right next to me on the client side of the counter. The staff at Taberna Express couldn't be less concerned about customers. I highly recommend trying anything else in this area of the terminal."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The portions are good but the food is merely passable. Might be a good place to have a couple of beers. Would come back for a quick between flight beer but would look somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I agree, a sign to seat yourself would be nice. The service was slow and the food cool. It definitely falls on the waitress. She was more busy in her mind then actually. Running around spilling coffee dropping menus and accomplishing little. Food was cool because she was busy in her mind."}
{"text":"For the price in an airport next to getting food pretty quickly, this is a decent place to eat. I tried their special big blue burrito and it was okay, kind of plain and could of used some spice, but other wise it was good for a meal."}
{"text":"First come first serve. Only sit down restaurant in the Delta terminal. Service is fast but supply can run low on staple items such as olives/olive juice for a martini.  Food is standard, still better than the cold sandwiches you can get from the refrigerated cart occupying the terminal hallway.  Nice way to kill time waiting for your flight and especially if you're still craving some mexican good while here in the south."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how I earned the Maverick badge for checking in here. It wasn't very memorable or anything to write home about. 
I seriously don't think anyone is searching out reviews to decide whether or not to grab last minute grub. But then again, maybe someone is.
On day one in Phoenix, I had awesome Mexican food, so I thought it came with the territory, not exactly so. 
I ordered chicken nachos, you can't really go terribly wrong there, right? Service was slow for what we ordered and the fact that they weren't crowded. 
All in all, it beats the snacks and sandwiches on the plane."}
{"text":"I have learned my lesson -- DO NOT go to a restaurant that rates only 2 stars on Yelp.  Yes, it's possible to screw up even basic nachos.

Service was fine, but the food was literally inedible.   It was like soggy chips with day-old, watered down Velveeta and questionable, unseasoned chicken pieces.  

Stick with beers here. In terminal 3, your only option for food is Wendy's before your flight!"}
{"text":"Let's be real. You're only here because 

-You don't really have options late at night in Terminal 3, but you NEED tequila.

-You're not from the southwest, so this is the best Mexican food you're gonna have.

Beer prices are off the charts, even compared to many other airports, AND the selection blows. I get margaritas because I feel less bad paying around $10 for those, and they're at least decent. 

Even the chips and salsa are lame...you don't get enough salsa and the chips are ice cold. I've endured the tacos as well and weren't impressed. 

The options are WAY cooler in other parts of the airport. I swear, Phoenix has better than this to offer."}
{"text":"Skip this place and save your stomach and wallet. Cold breakfast burrito without any flavor, smaller than what you would get just about anywhere else and super expensive. This place is definitely opportunistic and throwback to how airport food used to be.  Honestly, its disgusting and complete robbery."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat breakfast eat at Wendy's across from here . Wait staff is just as bad, not friendly just want to get u out so they can get another poor victim. Eggs ok bacon burnt home fries burnt pretty hard to mess up breakfast but I guess they can and did the cook needs to find another job but I guess that's why he works at the airport. Waiter gets a little friendlier when it's time to pay so he gets a tip !!!!!! If I could I would give negative stars , run run very fast from this place!!!! Remember 1 word when deciding to eat here WENDY'S"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is 100% better.... reminds me of elementary school lunch with shi&$ food. 

Would consider buying a hot pocket and heating it up with a lighter in the smoking section, or slamming your morning wood in a freezer door.."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast.  The prices were high for very marginal food....frozen potatoes that weren't even served warm.  Food didn't seem very fresh either.  Left with that heavy, ugh feeling."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast, didn't have any alcoholic drinks but ordered and was served pretty quickly at 530 AM. Ordered the carne asada and huevos which was ok...egg was not bad, steak was too salty and the potato was a little too soft. But service was super fast...it's the airport, can't expect too much right??"}
{"text":"Good nachos, expensive drinks, great servers/bartenders. Best place to go on terminal 3 unless your a Starbucks fanatic."}
{"text":"Go to Wendy's!! The service is slow, the food is certainly not worth the wait and the drinks are watered down, probably from all the ice melting as it sat there and waited for my server to pick it up."}
{"text":"Not offered any specials, and given the incorrect order when placing drink order...thank goodness I was only here for a connecting flight...wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"Horrible service -- did not even wait for food--
Rude order taker did not bring drinks 
Nor wanted to add items to my order...
And turned back on 2x me after I went to ask her about ordering and problems w drinks...
 Asked bartender for manager and got equal blank stare ....
Asked who I would complain to -- and they told me to use 1-877 phone which I did call ...
No follow up...

And I did ask her for why she was ignoring me /- just empty stare and silence.....  

I asked her this by the other servers/- zero response or accountability...

I hope it closes and a better restaurant opens up in that terminal 3 vs Wendy's....

Stay away or eat in other terminals ..."}
{"text":"Taking a redeye from Phoenix to Atlanta and was hoping for a drink before the flight to help me sleep. 

After ordering my drink, the bar tender looks at my Florida ID, notices the small crack down the middle, and says he can't accept it. The crack, more like a small fold really, is made from all the bar tenders bending it in the first place! Many Florida IDs have the same mark. 

I knows the laws, and I know it's to the bar tenders best judgement here. Hire someone with some common sense. This made a rough night on a redeye even worse."}
{"text":"I paid $10 for the worst and most expensive breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Microwaved eggs and a tiny amount of rubbery bacon wrapped in a terrible tortilla... not even the salsa was decent.  Flavor and texture of the burrito were awful, avoid this place for sure"}
{"text":"I came here for the express breakfast prior to a flight to Atlanta. It was pretty underwhelming. There were a few patrons here and there, so I can't speak about crowds, but I was craving breakfast and got the Huevos with bacon and potatoes, and it was served with a couple of flour tortillas on the side instead of bread. Huevos is spanish for eggs just so you all know. 

The meal was adequate. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't too good either. The best part of the meal was the eggs, which were fluffy and buttery. They were delicious. Everything else was horrible. The bacon barely tasted like bacon. It was more like crispy salt sticks. The potatoes, which are hard to screw up, in fact were tasteless as well as soggy and mushy, and the tortilla, well it was hard, dry, and stale. In fact, that four tortilla was the most disgusting tortilla I had ever eaten in the 10 years I lived in AZ, and I had been around college kids who had no inkling on how to cook who knew how to properly heat up a tortilla.

However I must say that the customer service was great, and the food arrived in a timely fashion. So if you are craving breakfast and want fast service and good customer service, but do not care about the quality of the breakfast food, then look no further than this place. I will not be coming here again myself, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible, it seemed like everything was made out of a can. I should have eaten Wendy's. save yourself the money and eat anywhere but this place."}
{"text":"Literally disgusting. I feel gross and nauseous now. Should have gone to Wendy's. Just save yourself and don't come here, even the beer is warm."}
{"text":"This place is crap. The drinks on the menu have no pricing. Buyer beware... 2 margaritas with chips and salsa will set you back $35... ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME?!?! I don't mind paying airport pricing for food/drinks but Christ on a cracker be transparent about your business model..."}
{"text":"The service was quick and very friendly, so she deserves a 5 star rating the food on the other hand the food lacked flavor, the rice is bland as well as the refried beans and the meat sandwich which it didn't say in the menu it was a sandwich was poorly made/prepared. 

It's an airport restaurant with airport food after all. 

Their beer selection and tequila is also very limited for a tequileria."}
{"text":"Not many options as previously stated. They were super slammed so it took a bit to get waited on. Order bottled water(Trust me on this).  Guacamole was good- main course was ok quesadilla was bland. It was better than the Wendy's option (no disrespect to frosty)!  There is enough room to navigate with your bags. Staff was friendly but overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Food and service are mediocre, eavesdropping at the bar is great.

Sitting at the bar and my drink order was fast. However, he took forever to check back with despite my asking for a menu and if the kitchen is still open.

I ordered chicken tortilla soup. It was served quickly and was Luke-warm. I thought the brought me the wrong thing because it was a brown gravy with tiny bits of chicken (think Cambell's condensed) beams, and huge green onion chunks covered in a gigantic dollup of sour cream. Thankfully it is served with tri-colored chips. I use this to scoop up he gravy.

This is nothing like a real taqueria and tastes overly processed, not fresh and bland. So disappointed. With 10 items on a menu one should think they can do them well.

Atmosphere-plenty of space, multiple tvs. The tvs are small though.

Overall not a great experience but nothing else is opened and I'm taking an overnight flight.

Sigh. Ill ask for my bill now so I don't run out of time since service is slow and I still haven't been asked-How's the soup?"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a formal complaint because I could not find a Web site to do so. 

First off, my waiter was visibly annoyed when I did not immediately order food. He even came back and took my menu away even though I had said I was going to order food later. I had gotten a drink,  so I was still a customer and the pave was hardly packed.

When my drink was finished,  he totally ignored me and his colleague had to check in with me.  Then he gave her the wrong drink order. 

I then started looking at the menu. When I closed it, even though he saw me,  he did not come to take my order.  As I prepared to flag him down,  same colleague had to come and save his butt. I ordered my burrito to go because I was so over it and I needed to charge my phone. 

Food comes out on a plate.  When I say something to my waiter he doesn't even respond to me just goes straight to the woman covering his table and goes \"did she really order that to go?\"  Yes,  I could hear him.  Rude.

So I pay,  finish my beer,  and go to put the burrito in the box. No tin foil, no apology for not getting it right. 

The table was super narrow and he put the box on the very edge.  Now in a hurry, I don't even look before putting the burrito in the box and it immediately falls to the floor.

When I asked what they could do,  the answer was essentially to eat it off the floor.

How about a refund for my delicious floor burrito? Or at least an apology?"}
{"text":"Ordered the chips and salsa with Chile de arbol salsa -- supposedly the spicest of the three (also had molcajete and green Chile salsa to choose from).  ($4.99)

Verdict: if jalapeño was a 5, their spiciest salsa is a 7 and their green Chile would be a 3. Choose your salsa carefully.  The spiciness of their arbol is just enough for you to break a sweat and is a pretty good level for a relaxing side of chips and salsa.  

I am Korean and LOVE spice so take this review with a grain if salt.

Decor is pretty lively and would consider the ambiance \"loud\" with music playing, customers chattering, and tvs barely audible during times of silence. 

Full bar with tvs playing sports.  Not bad of a spot if you are looking for a place to kill time before your boarding time. Plenty of seating available and staff is very friendly and attentive.  

I was not \"blown away\" hence the 4 but based on just good service, clean decor, lively atmosphere, and good chips and salsa, this spot is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast before a flight and food was fine.. my waiter was very good but I overheard at table next to mine a waitress supporting racist policies of our President.  Staff should refrain from participating (in fact she instigated it) in political conversations that may turn off other diners.  Additionally, if you are a racist, you may not want to work in a Mexican food establishment."}
{"text":"Last time I was here the margaritas were awesome. Today-not so much. Found out that the mix is made daily and varies depending on who made it. Would definitely order beer or wine next time. On a side note-the nachos and tacos were really good. Much better than I expected. Yes I will be back but let's face it there is not much of a choice in terminal 3."}
{"text":"Churroa were hard and unpleasant, nachos looked great but meat taste off and not authentic. Asked for a passion fruit marg they informed me that it was on the menu but they didn't sell it. All in all wouldn't return. Food was average. Nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"I sat in their restaurant for 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged me.  I was on a tight schedule so I figured their service was so bad that my meal wouldn't come before my flight.  Thank God for Starbucks."}
{"text":"Well, if you are about to starve, I guess the place will do. Over priced, yuck food. Angry help. Bad music. But the only place in Terminal 3 besides Wendy's."}
{"text":"Welcome to my very first one-star restaurant review. With very limited restaurant options in Sky Harbor's Terminal 3, I went with Tequileria. I chose wrong.

My server, Consuelo, provided that magical combination of surly attitude and horribly slow service. The woman who was seated after me, was DONE eating before my nachos were served to me...cold...by another server as my server waited for drinks at the bar while my food sat in the window. This was only after I flagged down the other server, of course. Consuelo did not check on me one single time after my food was delivered. I used to be a waitress so I am a generous tipper and almost never leave anything below 20%. Consuelo, however, was lucky to get a dollar & some change on my $25 tab...and that was generous.

Si, I did pay $13 for the worst nachos of my life. The chicken was cold, rubbery and inedible. I munched on a handful of chips with cold cheese sauce and queso fresca before giving up entirely.

I hope that this restaurant closes down so Terminal 3 can be blessed with a new, friendly, tasty dining option. In the meantime...EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely terrible. Ate three bites and gave up. 
Staff was ok until I clearly wasn't liking the food then got ignored. 
Wanted to give them a higher rating due to service alone but that fell short at the end. 
Over priced and bad service. 
Too bad they can't do better, good location."}
{"text":"Got the veggie quesadilla which wasn't bad. The salsa that came with it (in a plastic disposable container) was actually pretty good (minus the container). However, it's definitely overpriced for what it is (38 bucks for two veggie quesadillas and two ice teas). Also the waitress was pretty rude and had a I can't be bothered attitude. The only other sit down alternative in this terminal is fast food.  Maybe try their take out window, right next door."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick appetizer between flights and I regret coming here. I ordered guacamole and it was the most bland and watery guacamole I have ever had. The chips were no better. They didn't even give me the option to add more or less heat or anything. But what do you expect with airport food?"}
{"text":"Got their taco salad to go for a late night flight. It was quick service and a good large filling salad - lots of vegetables, chicken, and dressing. It wasn't fantastic or inexpensive, but it was pretty good for airport food. I would order it again if ever in the Phoenix airport."}
