{"text":"2016 and Dragon Palace has, over the years become family.  It is my favorite AUTHENTIC CHINESE restaurant in an older but nicely decorated Chinese  restaurant oozing with ambiance.  Once you have been there a few times you will realize that most dishes they make are traditional Chinese.  If you like it hotter, ask for their chili paste to spice it up.  Every dish is wonderful and the servings are generous enough to eat family style and still have leftovers to take home!  The ambiance, excellent plain Chinese food and the friendly warm reception during service makes this a definite repeater!  Their pupu platter and hot and sour soup is amazing. All their dishes are delicious . The only one I don't care for is the crispy Duck.  Not bad considering all the others are amazing.  Don't think you are  getting PF Chang or you will be disappointed..  This is old school traditional Chinese.  My faves?? Last week We had hot & sour soup -soooo good with big shrimp and other meat!  Then I ordered mooshoo pork Oh and my friend ordered Pork Chow mein.  Of course we received the wonton strips with sweet & sour sauce to dip on and a fortune cookie afterwards.  If you are lucky and they have the , you will get Pisang goring (fried banana) to die for!  Although the place was filled, service was still good and attentive.  Dishes arrived promptly and were hot when served.  As always, we never felt rushed and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  Definitely the TO GO PLACE for traditional Chinese cuisine!  Update:  AUG 2016 Still my FAVORITE traditional Chinese food restaurant - and it's local for me!  Consistently GOOD, generous portions and quick friendly service! Great for take/out also. Life is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Dragon Palace has been my family's go-to Chinese food place since before I was born, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I think I had my birthday dinner here for at least 10 birthdays in a row. Nothing changes in Dragon Palace-- the menu, the decor, the workers all seem stuck in a time warp in the strip mall's corner. But that's what makes it awesome! I will always remember the teal walls and the red booths.   Ok, enough reminiscing. Food- you should get the hot bean curd. It's listed in the vegetarian section, which is a total lie because it involves a lot of pork. But man it is tasty, and spicy! Tofu magic! The mushu vegetable wraps with plum sauce are also delicious and a waiter will come to your table and make them for you, which is fun to watch. Also, the free tea is awesome! It just adds to the whole experience.   Definitely a long time Phoenix establishment, don't be fooled by the boring outside, go check it out!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 10 years and this restaurant never, ever disappoints. Each dish tastes like the first time. The owner Ken is a wonderful and respectful host. Thank you Ken, you had me at Shrimp with Lobster Sauce!"}
{"text":"Eh, it definitely wasn't as good as some people write about. I did take-out...kinda pricey if you ask me. When I walked in there was a big mix up in the orders so it took a minute to pay for my food and get out of there. The chow mein was good. Fried rice was good. But nothing really stuck out as amazing. I don't think I'll be back anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Our family decided to try Dragon Palace this evening for dinner. Having grown up in downstate New York exposed to NY American Chinese, and living in Singapore for 4 years, we are definitely particular and picky when it comes to establishments that attempt to pass themselves off as authentic Chinese. Dragon Palace is neither authentic nor quality Chinese food.  Let's start with the positives. The food was hot, and the pre-packaged fortune cookies and almond cookies were fresh and delicious. This is pretty much all I can say positive about Dragon Palace.  One of my favorite Chinese food dishes to order is Egg Foo Young, so I had to try their Pork Egg Foo Young. After my first bite, I was convinced there was no egg used in this dish. It tasted like a bland dry floury pancake--awful. They did not use the usual thick savory brown sauce that normally accompanies Egg Foo Young, and they did not add the pork into the omelet. Instead, the overcooked grey slithers of pork were piled on top of the omelet and there was literally no sauce other than a greasy oil slick that drenched this bland dish. Egg Foo Young is an egg omelet patty, and the chefs at Dragon Palace managed to ruin an egg omelet.   We had Cashew Shrimp--another family favorite, but Dragon Palace managed to ruin that experience. The sauce was over powered in flavor by the generous use of green peppers, but that was the least of this dishes problem. The chef used two different sized shrimp, but even worse, the shrimp was not even cleaned! The shrimp still retained their gritty sand vein --otherwise known as the \"poop chute\"--gross! This is a definite indication that Dragon Palace does not use any quality assurance in their food standard practices.   The Shrimp Lo Mein and Peking Lo Mein was flavorless as was the fried rice. The meat used in both the Peking Lo Mein and Fried Rice was chewy, and it left us unsure of what type of meat it was--very off putting texture. In addition, the shrimp used in these dishes were not cleaned properly.  A big winner dish for us is always General Tso Chicken--just not at Dragon Palace. The batter coating on each morsel of chicken was soggy and not adhering to the chicken at all. The chef did not use the slightly spicy sauce that is normally used with this dish. It looked like they had just poured heaps of their red sweet and sour sauce on top of the chicken and added a few red chili peppers. We asked for it to be mild spicy, but there was not even a hint of heat in this dish.  We will never order from Dragon Palace again. It is overpriced poor quality bland food that is far from authentic Chinese or even authentic American Chinese food, and not cleaning the shrimp is a deal breaker for us--who knows what other poor standards are being practiced in this establishment."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have lived less than 5 miles from this place for over 20 years and never stopped in.  Looking for good Chinese so yelped the area and Dragon Palace popped up with good reviews.  Comments about the outside are right - little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is good....and it was!  We ordered three lunches to try out different dishes.  Both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken.  Not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli - nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next time....and there will be a next time!  Don't be fooled by the outside - step in and try the food - you'll be back."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food.  the food is always hot when it comes out, staff is super friendly. Always come here when the family wants to hang out."}
{"text":"Really good authentic and fresh Chinese food . I like to come for lunch because the food is fresh , good and inexpensive . The portions are big and it comes with tea, egg roll and really good egg drop soup . I took a friend to dragon palace that normally doesn't like Chinese food . He really enjoyed his Kung pao chicken and will be coming back . Great service as well ."}
{"text":"Very nice service here, but the food was NOT good. We had multiple items from the menu, and none of it was good. The decor is somewhat depressing.  All in all, it made us wish we were eating Chinese in San Fran."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said... It is in a crapy location. The food was ok, again like others said SALTY! You almost need to take a diuretic when you get home. They will not substitute anything for you. The first and probably only time there, I got the lunch combo and asked if I could substitute the hot and sour soup for the egg drop. The Asian man started screaming, \"no subtooshin, no subtooshin, it say no subtooshin\". I'm thinking damn, it was only a request. I said \"ok\", then he starts in with \"hot sour soup very special, feed 6 people, has lots of stuff in it\". I said ok, and he again said \"I no subtoot, you get soup\". Ok. Kinda funny when I look back at it. Maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Avoid this place at all cost. Food is mediocre at best but the staff is miserable and rude. Can't understand you and are as nasty as can be. Will never done here again ever"}
{"text":"Love this place! We've lived close by for years - passing by it so many times - but never ate here. Until last year. My brother read the reviews on Yelp and suggested it. It sooo reminded me of our favorite Chinese restaurant in CT. I love the Bo Bo Chicken. Its a little spicy with a very taste sauce. As others have mentioned, the House Special Chicken rocks! I found it tasted better when served at the restaurant. As take-out, it was a little dry. I've also found that most of the menu items that are labeled \"highly recommended\" are usually really good. Oh and for starters, the War Won Ton Soup is amazing! My only complaint is that the don't de-vein the shrimp! I've tried several shrimp dishes, including the War Won Ton Soup, and found the shrimp to still have the vein intact! Personally, that is not appealing to me so I don't order shrimp there. But truly everything else is wonderful. The service is also very good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese food restaturnt, I wish they had more locations it is sooooooo Yummyyyy!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. I am not a particular fan of egg rolls, but theirs are certainly the best I have ever had. Their lunch specials are great and you can get out of there for under 7 dollars during lunch.  The only thing that could be better is the location, but to be quite honest I would rather it be where its at with the current prices."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant regularly and it's a family favorite.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  We always get the Peking Chow Mein, Wor Wonton Soup and Orange Beef, and usually pick one more dish from a short list of other favorites.  I have never had a problem when requesting substitutions and they were happy to prepare  special orders when my son had to deal with some dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Dragon Palace is fantastic. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent.  The potstickers are to die for and the chili dipping sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Slightly greasy overall, but very delicious, particularly the vegetable dishes.  The meats are fine, but the Awesome Wor Wonton soup really has me crawling back for more.  The moo shu pork is great, but the vegetarian version would probably be fine too.  Service is great - while English fluency is not exactly impressive, it's clear that most of the employees are very careful to provide polite service with many \"Thank you, thank yous\".  I didn't really eat much Chinese food since I started eating healthier, but I'm glad I tried this place.  We've gone back 2-3 times now, and when people ask me where I go for Chinese food, I'm enthusiastic about recommending this place."}
{"text":"Good eats ilove it go go go?"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around!! Egg foo young, Mongolian beef, Chow Mein, etc. It is all delicious! I won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I will say if you have stomach issues and or haven't been eating out often, to possibly avoid eating here. I've had stomach cramps going on day number two, after eating here. My daughter has had a flare up, as well as my husband. The food is tasty but filled with grease and too much sodium content. If you're use to eating out then this may not affect you. If you suffer from IBS, Crohn's disease and or have other stomach sensitivities this would not be ideal for you."}
{"text":"Take out is quick and always super hot! Their orange chicken is superb! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food! Prices are fair and always has great service. Have been going here for years! It could use a bit of updating but the food is always good. Delivery service would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had in a long time! This place was recommended to us by the owner of Hammered Hog, and I don't think I will try another Chinese place in the Valley. The service was excellent, fast, friendly and patient (sometimes I take a long time to decide what I want to eat). The food was outstanding. The Won Ton soup had excellent flavor and lots of Shrimp! I ordered the Happy Family - a favorite of mine from when I lived in NY. This is the first place I have found in the 16 years that I have lived in Phoenix that actually makes it like they do back East. My son ordered the Mongolian beef - another perfectly prepared dish. Dave got the House Special Chicken -great flavor - crispy and juicy. I also love Fried Rice - again, great flavor, huge portion. All the portions were large, the price was reasonable and the service absolutely fantastic! The only downfall - no delivery. :-(   They have been in business for 33 years - and I know why they will continue to be there for another 30!  I suggest you go there now!"}
{"text":"Must order the chicken balls. Very fresh and tasty. The egg drop soup is very nice and the fresh egg rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I got incredibly sick the night after eating here.  Ate dinner at 7- started vomiting at midnight and threw up(even if it was just stomach acid and Gatorade) until well into the afternoon.  Horrible."}
{"text":"Just got take out.  Not good.  Almond Fried Chicken wasn't correct.  Fried rice tasted old.  Egg rolls were stringing with some type of leafy, lettuce vegetables and over fried.  Sweet and Sour Chicken was okay.  First timer.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try somewhere new and lets just say I just have stuck with the bad reviews... it was disgusting the chicken was barely chewable even my lkids didnt like what they ate.. the crab puffs had like a pinch of stuff in the middle there was hardly anything in there we ordered the seseme chicken which may have been the best of the 3 things, then we ordered  the sweet and sour which was horrible and my poor husbands teryaki chicken was a runny disgusting mess.. we will not order from here again.."}
{"text":"The Chinese food was greasy and poorly prepared. The service was worse. Avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. It's in a not so great location (tucked in the back corner of a dead shopping plaza) but the food is pretty darned good. You go inside and the decor is loud, yet drab. The walls are painted a striking teal, accompanied with a bright red. Yet it's not very well lit, and the lights look like they  need replacing.   Anyways, we went there for dinner and the service was fast, and the servers were friendly. Our food came out quickly and hot. I really liked the crab puffs. Very good. It was also nice to get free hot tea and water - something I miss about a lot of Phoenix Asian based eateries. The food wasn't too greasy and tasted great. The chicken chow mein tasted a lot like Panda Express, but wasn't nearly as greasy. On average, for this time of day, the avg price for a meal was $10. Appetizers ran the gamut from $2 to $7 (on avg).   I will definitely be adding this to my list of regular haunts."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Dragon Palace last night. My hubby went to pick it up on his way home from work and it was ready on time. Since this was our first time, we opted for the Mandarin Dinner for 2 so we could try a few things. I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food because it tends to be too greasy and salty for me; however, this was Seriously SO delicious! We were pleasantly surprised to see the take out containers packed full. The Mandarin Dinner comes with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Pork wontons (greasy but that's kind of just how they are - the taste was good tho), Wor Wonton Soup (so delicious) with fried crispies on the side, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried Rice, 2 Fortune Cookies and 2 Almond Cookies---all for $30! What a great deal! Let's just say we have leftovers for lunch (plus some) today.    I'd never had Wor Wonton Soup before and this was packed full of chicken, shrimp, pork, veggies all in a clear broth and it was so flavorful! I normally add soy sauce (actually I use liquid aminos) but that would have made it too salty. It was perfect just the way it was prepared! This was my favorite dish and definitely ordering that again.  My husband loved the Mongolian Beef - just all beef and green onions in a yummy brown sauce. Lots of beef!!  The Sweet and Sour pork was perfect! Sometimes I order S&S and there's overkill of too many onions, peppers, and pineapple, but not this one! They really focus on delivering you the pork! The only change is next time I'll probably request the sweet and sour sauce on the side because by the time we got it home the pieces in the middle and bottom started getting a little soggy.  The Pork Fried Rice is packed with pork, veggies and eggs. We were very impressed. So yummy!  We will definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried takeout at Dragon Palace a few weeks ago and were really pleased. We ordered one of their specials, the house beef, and it was AWESOME! It honestly got better with every bite and we talked about it for days. We also got the hot n sour soup but frankly it was neither hot nor sour, but somewhat tasty (wouldn't order again).  We went back the other night and dined in and got the happy family---which was delicious and the seafood in it was cooked to perfection---and the Mongolian beef, which was also tasty and tender. We also tried a couple more soups and neither of us loved any of them---just missing something. Probably stay away from the soups going forward to focus on better stuff.  I love spicy food and my request for a chili sauce or hot sauce was answered with a funky paste of mostly seeds that had absolutely zero heat level to it---and I mean zero. I just wanted something like sriracha to kick it up and they apparently don't have that and in my opinion should.  Everyone was polite and friendly, and the owner (assumed it was the owner) walked around and asked how things were and thanked us---which by the way---many \"fine dining\" restaurants fail to do and it is so simple and leaves an impression.  We will definitely return to Dragon Palace. It's not PF Chang's in terms of atmosphere but when you want good food and don't feel like a big hassle this is the place."}
{"text":"I tried Dragon Palace after reading rave reviews here on Yelp. I rate three stars as I found the food okay but not great. The cuisine is Cantonese and I prefer dishes from the Sichuan province. I like a steamed dumpling and all Dragon offers are fried dumplings. I've had fried dumplings before at other restaurants and there are usually light fry marks on the dumpling's wrapper. The dumplings at Dragon seemed to be fried in a deep fat fryer. They were ok -- a bit on the heavy and greasy side. The House Special Beef was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The beef was VERY tender. The red pepper sauce that was served on the side was quite tasty. The Mongolian Beef was a bit flat and the Sesame Chicken seemed to be pieces of pre-fried chicken you'd get from Costco in the frozen section. Again, these seemed deep fried and not with a light, sticky coating that I prefer. The sauce was super sweet and lacked flavor. Also, Sesame Chicken is usually served with broccoli and this came with no vegetable.   I enjoyed the Chinese decor including lanterns with a spinning cylinder my grandmother used to have. Very Chinatown-ish as were the murals. However the bar area was very cluttered and seemed to be used partly for takeout box storage. The restaurant needs to de-clutter. It looked like health department certificates (home printed) were taped on a wall behind the cash register. Not good. Those should be trashed as well as the coin vending machines in the lobby.   This all said, the service was good, friendly and fast.   I like there is a pot of hot tea on the table. The fried banana strips at the end are also a nice touch.   Overall, Dragon Palace could use a lot of sprucing up and decluttering inside and dishes that offer a little more flavor. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"We order food for my husband 50th birthday we enjoyed and we will be ordering again thank you for making my husband birthday special"}
{"text":"I've been to Hong kong, Beijing, etc. The food here is superb and the portions extremely large. We love it. The best. Words can't describe this food, it's wonderful. Every meal there is like a trip back to the Orient. You won't regret taking the time to dine here."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef and chicken chow mein were very bland, and lacking on any major flavor."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall. However, the food was delicious. The egg rolls are hand made and the sauces are very good. I think they use MSG but that doesn't bother me at all. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"I did my first uber eats from this place . Food was hot contains where super full  Food tasted as good as any chineese food place or better . Great value for you money . I would order again when in the mood ."}
{"text":"This place brings back great memories. Of youth, fun and friends. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to eat here again. I had not done so in years (more then 5, less then 10). I took a new friend and ordered my old favorite, House Special Chicken. It was just as I remembered it. Crispy fried outside, sitting in a ginger and garlic sauce (I love it when food in a sauce is still crisp). My friend approved of her Sesame Chicken but I didn't try any of it, myself.   One bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip.   I wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again.   What did the critics say? \"It all really good, mijo.\" Success.   I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food. I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty, stick-to-your-ribs, let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food, Dragon Palace is hard to beat. The dark, quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too, so I say, eat-in if you can."}
{"text":"My go to place when I crave Chinese food. Fast Delivery."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Been going here for over 10 years and average about twice a month for take away....  I'm pretty basic but love the Chicken Fried Rice (all white meat - best in valley) and Wor Wonton Soup as well as the Mongolian Beef... Just a great neighborhood restaurant with excellent service and food"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery for first time, wonton and hot and sour soup, singapore noodles and ginger beef. It was awesome. Timely delivery, tasty food and got the order right. Will be ordering from them again soon with hopes this continues!"}
{"text":"Wow! For the money ( about $35 for two), the best chinese food in town, no doubt. The only thing is that the actual dinner for two could feed at least four.  Wouldn't go to eat in the area but we've seen the reviews on this place and decided to give it a try - it was worth it 100%."}
{"text":"Ordered with Uber Eats. Food came hot and fresh. Ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce, combo fried rice, and cantonese chow mein. Food quality was decent. Most importantly, it came HOT! No complaints."}
{"text":"The lunch special is not too shabby.  We got the sweet and sour chicken and the Mongolian beef.  The sweet and sour wasn't too bad but the Mongolian beef had a ton of oil on the plate and it was really salty.  But, for the price I think it's not bad and they have the lunch special on Saturday's too which is nice.  Most places only have the lunch special during the week only but this place has it for Saturday 12-2, I believe. It's worth a visit, don't let the weird strip mall and the sketchy parking lot scare you off."}
{"text":"You can tell this is a real Chinese restaurant. How? Every time you go, you see the same little kid doing her homework at a small table by herself. Lol.  The food is pretty standard, but good. We were introduced to this place by friends of ours. After our favorite Chinese restaurant changed hands, we were in need of a replacement. Luckily for us, they had found this place.   It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping plaza that looks a bit deserted; pretty simple to miss if you were driving by. Once you walk in, you see this old skool cash register...straight up vintage, probably circa 1952. I definitely appreciate how clean it is. The owners take pride in their restaurant. Normally, Chinese restaurants lack both cleanliness and ambiance.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated. And the service is outstanding! The first time we went there, I asked a lady who was waiting on a to-go order what she recommended. She said the Mongolian beef, which we did order. She was right; it was good.  Full flavored, and incredibly tender beef. I was thrilled bc I was able to get honey walnut shrimp. If that's a dish you haven't tried, you are missing out. I also recommend an order of their chicken wings under \"Appetizers\".   To enjoy a sampling of their food, we'll order the family meals. Expect to leave with leftovers. I recommend the Dragon Dinner Special. The wor wonton soup that comes with it seems to differ slightly from the one offered with the Mandarin Dinner special. If you're not used to bamboo shoots, you may dislike the wor wonton soup offered with the latter.   My husband said it had a weird after taste to him. I didn't notice bc I like bamboo shoots. The next day, the flavor of the bamboo shoots was more noticeable. As a word of caution: don't order an extra meal with the family style dinners. It'll just be overkill. And, you won't have any room on the table."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a hidden gem. If you haven't eaten here, you need to go there, like now. It's been in business for over 30 years from what I've been told.   The staff is incredibly friendly and they WILL remember you the next time you eat there. They treat my wife and I very well every time we are there. It's probably because we had our wedding rehearsal dinner there. That's how much we enjoy this place.   The food is always hot and very tasty. They give you hot tea, and fried wontons every time you eat there and are always very quick with their service. My recommendations are: Mongolian Beef, Sizzling Rice Soup (if you're in the mood for soup), Honey Walnut Shrimp, Happy Family, Shrimp Fried rice...I could go on and on, but they have so many good options.   If you're in the mood for Chinese and want a friendly and quiet place to eat, go to Dragon Palace!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years. Had lunch and got the shrimp in lobster sauce and it was delicious. Exceeded expectations for a well priced Chinese restaurant. I'll be back soon to try other menu items. Kungpao shrimp up next, maybe tomorrow. Yum."}
{"text":"First day open and I thought I would give Dragon a try. We ordered the General Tsos chicken, a standard staple, and it was good. The dinner was large enough for my wife and I to share and we were both satisfied. One downside, they don't have veggie egg rolls. We will be trying more off the menu to see if they are more than a one trick pony. To Erik B, the price is what we were expecting for a meal. By the way, customers from Sharpsburg don't have to settle for okay quality food. We actually like high quality food and can pay more for it. Snob much?"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a kid and it has always been delicious!  It is tucked away in the corner so don't miss it!  It is my favorite Chinese food ever.  I have tried several Chinese food places and while they all are pretty good nothing compares to Dragon Palace."}
{"text":"Happy to have a solid Chinese restaurant in Sharpsburg! Everything we had was tasty, fresh, plentiful and perfectly prepared. Service was fast pleasant and efficient. Fair prices, we're instant fans and will be back often. Welcome to the neighborhood, can't wait to dive deeper into the menu, especially the \"Authentic Chinese Menu\"."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Overall, their food is great and the lunch specials are a real bargain. The staff is polite and attentive and won't leave you waiting for much, The complimentary hot tea is excellent. I make it to dragon palace for lunch whenever I can.  The interior of this place is something else.  the walls are red and turquoise with gigantic  reliefs of Chinese themes scenes.  Its a family run business and not everybody speaks English, so be prepared to order by letter on the men"}
{"text":"This place is kind of buried in a dead little strip mall opposite of Joe's Grotto and can be a little less than eye catching from the outside. Once inside, you can tell it's has been around for a while. However, I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing.   The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary. The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix.   They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here, although they do have a lot of business on the take out side. We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items. The one we usually get includes Wonton soup, the Poo Poo Platter (lol), Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by), Sizzling Shrimp, House Special Chicken (best chicken ever), Mushu Pork, and Peking Fried Rice. And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares.   Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious, memorable and authentic Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Kids LOVED it too. They are picky.   Would have got 5 stars, but the service is rude. Been there a couple of times and they always rush you out. If you are talking to others at your table they will interrupt and ask if your done with your plate. lol. I've had them literally take plate before I set fork down to finish bite in my mouth. They literally stand and watch you eat and yes, quick on refills, but also pushy to get you out.   I'm not use to it. It's so uncomfortable to have them stare, push, and grab food out from under you.   The music and atmosphere is nice, just wish you could relax and enjoy it and not feel unwanted there. So strange."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years when it was owned by the prior owner.  What a fantastic dinner we had!  The place hasn't changed that much physically, that is, still the bright red walls along the bright turquoise ones.  This place is the stereotype of chinese restaurants.  But, boy oh boy has the food changed.  The food was incredible.   We started with egg drop soup, hearty and delicious at a mere $2.00  It had tofu in it too.  I had the shredded pork with brown rice (1.00 add on).  It was a huge portion but more importantly, delicious.  The other dish was a beef dish (name? ) Shi- something.  Large, large and delish, delish.   Prices are super reasonable and service is attentive. I will be coming back soon.  This place is giving great food with great pricing.  You can't get that in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Delivery was promt, the food was exceptional. Will have to further explore the menu. Ordered the General Tso's, spring rolls, and beef sticks. I know what is lunch for Monday."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  The food is amazing: tasty, steaming hot, and inimitable.  The service is great, too;  we always get a table quickly, are waited on immediately, and they always pay extra attention to us.. In fact, we go once or twice a month and now know the owners, who are very friendly.  And they even know us by name, which comes in handy when we happen to place phone orders.   Before you even order, they start you off with hot tea, if you desire.  After we place our order, the soup is served piping hot, with those amazing crunchy pieces to put in the soup, or, as my young son does, to dip in the red sauce often used for egg rolls.  And speaking of egg rolls, Dragon Palace has the best egg rolls I have ever tasted anywhere.  Their entrees are exceptional and huge; we always have a \"doggy bag\" for leftovers when we leave.  The atmosphere is conducive to what you should get at a Chinese restaurant, with decorations, lighting, and music.  One time, when the music was not Asian sounding, my son asked the owners to change it to their usual music, and they did as he requested.  Dragon palace is the best Chinese restaurant anywhere."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 35 years! Lunch specials are the best. House Special Chicken and Shrimp With Lobster Sauce are favorites!"}
{"text":"I play in Lost in Lies very often at Joe's Grotto next door to here, so every show night my band eats here before the show. They always take fantastic care of us, almost always with a table of 7 or more with split checks. The food is hot and fresh, the Chili paste is deliciously spicy, everything is just the way it should be. Highly suggest garlic chicken and house special beef."}
{"text":"If you wanna go into a time machine and go back to the late 70's early 80's and eat some Americanized Chinese food just like most restaurants presented it back then.  Then this is your place, all the way the decor to the food and the way they course it in their presentation is a blast from the past. P.S this was my grandmas favorite Chinese Restaurant.  We all ate here in memory of her on her funeral.   The owner is nice but you can tell this isn't his first Rodeo if you know what I mean.  He is very robotic now, but still nice. You will either love this place or if you like more modern places prob hate it."}
{"text":"This place is a go to staple in the neighborhood... Been going here for years and have never been disappointed... The house special chicken with white meat is what your looking for...."}
{"text":"I love love this place!!!    As a child my parents brought us here at least once a week.  As an adult I live a little further away so trips have become few and far between.  Last night my husband suggested we go because I wasn't feeling well and he knows that their sizzling rice soup is my favorite!!!   It was so awesome to walk thru the doors and feel like I was back to my childhood, nothing has changed and the best part the food hadn't either still it's great flavor!!   Best Chinese food around!!!   Tonight we enjoyed the sizzling rice soup, egg rolls, cashew shrimp and pork fried rice..  You have to try this place, you won't be disappointed in the food or the service and you will come back for more guaranteed.."}
{"text":"I popped in last week to have lunch with my friend and ordered from the lunch menu. Pretty cheap, less than $20 for both of our meals plus drinks and an upgrade to spring rolls instead of egg rolls.  The spring rolls were really good, fresh and hot.   I ordered the General Tsao chicken with fried rice and chicken chow mein. I don't normally order chicken chow mein because I don't really like it, the one I had here was A1. The chicken was tender and the bean sprouts actually had flavor. The General Tsao was flavorful as well, sweet tender chunks of breaded chicken.  The portion size was enough for both of us to take home left overs.   I can't really complain about anything here. The food was fresh, hot and didn't lack flavour in any way."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was in the womb lol. Edward and his family sold it to the new family and we miss them, but he at least sold the recipes to them too. Thank God cause this place is my comfort food. The sizzling rice soup is a fave especially when I'm sick and he gave my husband pick it up for me. The egg drop soup is just as yummy. The food is all amazing... Never eaten anything I didn't love. Nice large backroom for parties."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had the chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein, orange chicken and moo shu pork. Everything was great. Came out fast, hot and fresh. We will be back again soon. Oh and also huge portions."}
{"text":"So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.  The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying.   As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (\"Express yourself now.\" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.  All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a very good hidden little gem.  Ive tried every Chinese restaurant in the area and Dragon Palace is the best, and not just because their food is good but because the owner is a class act.  I came to grab a carry out order since i was in the vicinity and noticed upon approaching the door that they didn't open until 5pm (it was 4:25).  I was about to turn away in disappointment when the owner unlocked the door and asked if i was just doing carry out.  When I said yes he welcomed me inside and took my order.  That right there is just fantastic business.   Try seeing that at any other place, you would leave hungry.... especially at a certain place on tatum/thunderbird that shall not be named.    I got the house special chicken, Mongolian beef, and small wonton soup.  All of them are piping hot, fresh, and delicious.  This is my go to spot for Chinese now and they very much deserve the business."}
{"text":"Entertained family who frequent the upscale House of Louie in West Covina, CA to the ultimate value...Chinese lunch.  I used to patronize Dragon Palace in 1979 when I first moved here and half the subsequent decade because 1) it was only one of a few  decent places in the vicinity and 2) it was damn good food, and still is in my estimation.  What a treat...why haven't I been back more often over the last few years?    One big let down at other places has been my former favorite, sweet and sour pork, as chewy, gristly over cooked lumps covered in gooey coating.  DP nailed it with tasty chunks of pork wrapped in a crispy tempura type batter...heavenly.  This large lunch for only $5.95 has lit a fire under me to remember to use this place a lot more now.  The only thing we need now is help from you advertising geniuses  to suggest signage to get people to pay heads-up attention and find the delicacies hiding in the back corner!"}
{"text":"Definately worth the drive! New favorite Chinese restaurant! A hidden gem. flavors are great and food is abundent and soooo reasonable for that family of 4 to go out and enjoy. a meal out."}
{"text":"Dragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again.   The egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious.   We also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good.   I have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all.   They do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive.   Dragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese. I've never actually been in the restaurant but I order it delivered all the time. Food is fresh, portions are generous, not greasy at all and you don't feel like crap afterwards. Pricy but well worth the money."}
{"text":"I used to live fairly close to Dragon Palace, and my girlfriend and I would go here regularly. It was a nice place to eat in, as they were rarely busy. We also loved getting takeout here and eating it throughout the week. They have decent portions for the price so you could probably get 2 meals for each order. The fried rice was nothing to write home about, but there were a few dishes we really enjoyed, like the house beef.  I have a few friends who like it and one who doesn't. Don't expect to be blown away, but it's a nice, consistent hole-in-the-wall-type of place for the price."}
{"text":"Let me just say I am not going to use words like throw-back( except I am spelling it correctly unlike our reviewer down below...) or retro to describe Dragon Palace. Let's be honest and say that it has looked just about entirely the same since the place opened, about 30 years ago.   More positively I get greeted like family upon entering,( and I'm not Chinese either - Im a Korean who does not eat Korean food, and there's no inside jokes with the owner)  the service seems to always be good. I have grown up eating at this restaurant for years and can even remember being a little kid and craving their egg rolls. So good.   For those that were disappointed, did you forget that everyone on yelp thinks they are the next up and coming food critic and is extremely opinionated about their experience throwing in the quintessential yelp review words such as ambience or atmosphere all the while possibly mistaking outdated decor for intentional sarcasm? Or are you a picky eater? Or did you expect an overseasoned dish ala PF Chang's?   The food here is plain and simple. The bathroom is clean but could also be mistaken for one in a dive bar as well. The water in the bathroom faucet is insanely hot as the handwritten note warns.I am quite the drinker, but I don't go here for my drinks. I go here for delicious and salty Chinese food. I love the hot tea here, so my cocktail can wait until later.   Go for lunch, it's ridiculously affordable. You will leave full.   This is what I order:   (I don't mind that there is a small sized splash of what appears to be soy sauce on the zigzag border that sits just above the wood paneling in the booth. It seems like it has been there since my 10th Birthday anyway)    Egg drop soup. I like a thicker broth, this is the best. It gets better when you take your first bite  and there are fresh veggies like onion, red bell pepper and tofu in the soup. The fried wontons they serve with it make it even better. If I order egg drop soup anywhere else I immediately regret it, and crave this. It is definitely more egg-y than watery, but that's how I like it.   I only eat egg rolls from here. The wrapper is fried to crisp perfection Their hot mustard is the best anywhere in my personal opinion.   House Special Chicken( all white meat for only 50cents) Crab puffs, Shrimp and Snow Peas, Lemon Chicken, Almond Chicken, and The Mongolian Beef, are some of my most favorites, and they are safe bets.   Also, it says they don't cater, but my Dad just got remarried and they let us order enough food for 100 people with advance notice which was really nice."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since the 70's when I was young.  Must have Garlic Shrimp. LOVE IT and crave it.That is my favorite but you can't really go wrong with any item on the menu and I have tried most of them through the years!   Also the owners are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Look no further for an awesome Chinese food fix. Service is quick without frills-as one would be accustomed to in a restaurant serving this kind of food-but is great tasting and portions are more than anyone could ever expect to eat-so plenty to bring home."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars.  By far the best chinese food in Phoenix in my opinion and the staff is super friendly.  I love finding local places like this instead of the souless PF Changs and Pei-Weis.  The candied banana won-tons are the best!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Not overly impressed.  Ordered a chicken dish house special lots of dark meat chicken deep fried.  Egg drop soup was the best part. Rice ok. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Incredible. From start to finish Dragon Palace is one of the best Chinese Restaurants I have ever had. I ordered several dishes from Chow Mein to Orange Chicken and it was absolutely incredible. I think it is safe to assume that everything else is equally as good. Incredible and a definite must for anyone in need of great service with excellent food."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm mmmmm!! Let me just say, I am not a huge fan of Chinese food but this place totally knocks my socks off! Amazing Szechuan chicken, great fried rice and wonderful soup! They even serve hot tea with every meal!! You won't be dissatisfied if you have a craving for good Chinese food! The waitress and waiters are very attentive, your glass will never go empty!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Luv this food!  Real food- not pre-frozen chicken etc. Bliq! I am picky- really picky! Delivered hot! Delivered with polite service! Best Chinese in the area!"}
{"text":"One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was just me on my own tonight and i was a bit later than usual and a bit hungry and when i spotted this place, on impulse i decided to grab some food to go.  I walked in and ordered at the front bar area, the place was quiet for a Thursday night, but i wasn't staying.  I ordered their dinner for one special and an extra eggroll.  I had a seat and before you know it my order was ready.  I thought hey that was quick, like lightning fast.  So i was suspicious if this is some reheated or a batch cooked for the expected dinner rush, Well i had to wait until i got home.  It smelled good in the car though.  I got home and cracked it open and much to my surprise everything was hot and fresh and delicious and even the eggrolls were still crunchy.  This place has their act together.  Maybe because it was a quiet night but fast and friendly service, and fresh tasty food, thats a winning combination.  Yup, I'll be back.  For takeout it was fantastic so next time i hope to eat in their dining room and give them the real test of great taste and service."}
{"text":"The Dragon Palace is clean and decorated nicely. The prices are very reasonable, the food came very quickly and tasted great. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to this place all the time. The people running the place are legit and this is the kind of old fashiony Chinese food restaurant you wanna go to where it's a hole in the wall, mom and pop shop, but has that fabulous 1970's decor. We came here on Valentines for some love supper and were shocked by their wine prices. I think they were all $13.95 a bottle which is very reasonable for house wine prices. Happy family and fried dumplings are main stays for us. Everything is great so try it all. You'll have left overs for tomorrow too."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. I've had as authentic as you can get and this wasn't bad. Nice staff and lots of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here all the time. Their shrimp in lobster sauce with shrimp fried rice is, in my opinion, one of the best things on their menu!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was lacking. They never said a word to us other than asking if we were ready to order.   We ordered one of the dinners which came it's wor won ton soup (delicious!!!), egg rolls and chicken wings, pork fried rice, house chicken, and mu shu pork. The house chicken was a mix of white and dark meat and a lot of breading, and the mu shu pork came out already rolled.   The soup arrived and then everything came out very quickly afterwards and was awkwardly placed on our table in one corner in the way of everything else. We were constantly rearranging things so we could access our plates.   With our check we got a pleasant surprise of sweet and sticky banana wontons. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large as we took home a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"New to the area, been looking for a solid Chinese food restaurant, we found it! We've only picked up but definitely want to dine in next time around. Nice to have a awesome Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood, thanks"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix - 32nd St & Thunderbird.  The egg drop soup is amazing.  Our favourites - beef broccoli and sweet & sour chicken.  All meals come with steamed rice, green tea, fortune cookies, and fried bananas."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night and grabbed some food to go.  I read all the great yelp reviews and decided to try it.   Loved the meat dumplings!!  I usually don't like dumplings but theirs were great!!  We also had the honey dipped chicken.  That was my favorite.  They are like little drumsticks covered in a honey sauce.  They were so good.  I wasn't a big fan of the chow mien noodles but everything else was yummy!!  I want to try their dessert next time- the fried banana....looks delicious"}
{"text":"1st and only time here.   Ordered House Chicken lunch special.  Egg drop soup that came with it was way too thick.  House fried rice that also came with it was too bland.  Chicken wasn't too bad.  Not impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"A nice surprise, for Sharpsburg!  We gave it a try last night, take out style. They has quite a few orders ready to go, and about half the tables were filled. Big hello from the staff, very friendly and they seemed genuinely appreciate for the business. We started with steamed veggie dumplings, sort of the low point.The dough was quite thick and heavy - BUT they were large and filled with a very tasty blend of veggies. Trimmed the extra dough off and they were gobbled up!  Moved on to the main dishes - Szechuan beef (lots of veggies, great taste, tender beef), Dragon and Phoenix (tender chicken, shrimp, lots of crisp veggies) which was a little bland but very good taste, and veggie fried rice (plenty of fresh veggies with maybe some frozen peas and carrots) - again very tasty. We were struck by the amount and freshness of the veggies, the tenderness of the chicken and beef, and the low amount of oil used. Potions were plenty large (leftovers for lunch), food sat well with everyone, and the prices were good. I wish they had brown or similar rice but only white rice is available. The decor is attractive, the restaurant was quite clean, we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"So so so good!!  The dinner portions were so much for two people. The wonton soup had everything in more in it including beef, pork, and shrimp. The service was superb as well!!  Definitely will come back again in the future."}
{"text":"I love living in Sharpsburg, but one downside is the current lack of quality food options that consist of anything other than pizza. Thanks to Dragon Palace, this is beginning to change. Having delicious and reasonably priced Chinese food (with authentic options!) just a short walk from home is exactly what the neighborhood needed. I've been anticipating the opening ever since the \"coming soon\" sign was posted outside some weeks ago, so I made it a point to try the restaurant on their opening night. My wife and I walked down and decided to dine inside. The dining room was very clean and welcoming. My wife and I sat down, ordered some hot tea and began looking over the menu. The food options were exactly what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, but I was really surprised to see that they included a section of authentic dishes to supplement the standard Americanized fare. I chose to dive into the authentic menu and ordered the Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork along with the Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper (served with a side of white rice). The Dan Dan Noodles were very delicious, but the Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper was a big standout for me. If you like spicy food, definitely give this a try. The chicken is nicely breaded and fried to the perfect crispness, and the dried peppers give this the perfect punch of spice. My wife ordered an Egg Roll and the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (served with a side of white rice). She tells me that the Eggplant was very good, but the Egg Roll was one of the best she's ever eaten. We also shared an order of Steamed Dumplings, which is one of my favorite dishes whenever I eat Chinese. The Steamed Dumplings at Dragon Palace are very, very good. I could see myself having a craving for these and popping in for a quick order as a snack from time to time. They're that good! The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. Being that this was opening night, things got a little busy and service was a little slower than you would expect, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since there was a constant stream of takeout orders coming in and out of the doors in the time that we were there enjoying our meal. Obviously this speaks to the people of Sharpsburg being excited for a new neighborhood food option that is something other than pizza. I hope that this excitement continues and that Dragon Palace does well in it's new home. I also hope that the success of Dragon Palace sparks other restaurants to take a shot on Sharpsburg. Until then, I'm already thinking about the next time I'm going to eat those dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Bland watered-down tea.  Wonton soup--sorry broth; wonton ok.   Vegetable mu-shu came in what looked like a burrito.  Had large chunks of egg in it.  More like a Mexican burrito than Chinese. Family style bean curd was good & rather MSG-laden.    One-time visit place.  Won't be returning.  Not sure what people are talking about with this restaurant being the best Chinese they've ever had.  Decor & ambiance very cheap feeling also."}
{"text":"Sizzling rice soup is a must. There isn't a bad thing on the menu, been eating here for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Love the scallion pancake and the spicy crispy chicken.  Try the special spicy dipping sauce, I now dip everything with it.  My dog Chops loves going there too, we always leave him some rice or leftover."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and this is best chinese food I've had?! I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner last night!  Great portions, fabulous food, and kind service.  Our family of 10 thoroughly enjoyed each bite...left overs were just as yummy!  The House Special Chicken was really good as was the Sizzling.  They apparently offer a military rate, though we forgot to have it applied.  A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food was tasteless. Everything I ordered had no spice even though it said it was a spicy dish. They also forgot 2 items I ordered. I don't recommend this restaurant. Spend your money else were."}
{"text":"Dragon Palace was definitely busy tonight, but everything was still fast and delicious. We got the salt and pepper shrimp and the General Tso's shrimp - both featured a good portion of very large and nicely cooked shrimp with perfect white rice. I know that is an easy hurdle to jump but sometimes to-go rice is dry or too sticky, so it's worth noting. I never had salt and pepper shrimp (or any other salt-n-pepper'd protein) but I will absolutely get it again. The shrimp was fried in a delicious light batter (with salt and pepper), and had a mix of garlic, scallions, and mildly spicy bell peppers. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to skip the sauce, but for those sauce bosses out there: their General Tso's sauce was on point. Only criticism would be the broccoli was missed and in the future after their soft opening it would be a great addition to the Tso's. We're really looking forward to trying appetizers from the authentic side of the menu.  Overall I think this Sharpsburg family has found a new tradition. We're thrilled to have another restaurant to walk to!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this little gem has been practically in our backyard all these years and I've just barely discovered it! Dragon Palace has some of the best Chinese food we've had anywhere in Phoenix. Tonight, we ordered the Mongolian Beef and Szechuan Chicken and were blown away -- delicious! Service was great, and our takeout order was ready in no time. We will certainly be back for more, soon!"}
{"text":"Dragon Palace is the place I am most likely to go in the Valley for Chinese food.  It is close to my house, has a good atmosphere, friendly staff and good food.  The restaurant is standard Chinese American fare.  My personal favorite is the Mongolian Beef which is always made perfect with scallions and white rice.  Egg rolls are tasty as is the egg drop soup.  The meals always come with the traditional hot tea and end with a fortune cookie.  The atmosphere is old school with booths around the walls and tables within the room.     If you are looking for a decent Chinese restaurant with good food and no surprises, you have come to the right place."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic.  I ate there twice this week.  One day we walked in 3 minutes after they had closed for lunch and they were still so kind to serve us and not make us feel rushed.  The food portions are huge and just fresh as can be."}
{"text":"The food is your typical Americanized Chinese fare. While not terrible it was also nothing to write home about.  The staff was not rude, if anything I think the language barrier might make things a little awkward but the staff smiled and did their best.  The reason for the low rating is the state of the building and cleanliness. It felt like there was no heat at all in the lobby/dining area. We were shivering during the ten or fifteen minutes we had to wait. The entire place is in need of a deep cleaning. Everything just appears dingy and dirty.   I feel like if the proprietors would invest a little bit in the upkeep of the storefront that I could give them a higher rating."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants  in town. Over the years I have probably had everything on the menu. The sizzling rice soup is the best I've had. I usually have one of the shrimp dishes, my favorite being the Kung Pao Shrimp."}
{"text":"More authentic than places like Panda Express, but definitely not somewhere I'd go for quality Chinese food. I went with a big group and we ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. Overall their prices are low, but their food is rather one-dimensional. And they drench almost all of their dishes in thick sauces, making them feel greasy and unhealthy.  While the service is good and they have a lot of seating for large groups, the food is nothing more than something cheap and filling."}
{"text":"I LOVE Dragon Palace. I have been going here for about 16 years.  It is your average looking neighborhood, family owned chinese restaurant. They have crazy lanterns and blue walls inside.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  They will make recomendations and help you out with ordering.  Lunch is awesome...you can order from a list of about 15 dishes and it comes with rice, wantons, and an eggroll all for about 9 bucks.  Dinner is great too...portions are large and perfect for sharing.  I would definetly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out.  Food arrived lightning fast.  It was hot, each dish had fresh ingredients, crunchy veggies.  Everything was seasoned to perfection.  I'll be going back for more - thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The Peking fried rice and Mongolian beef are amazing. Definitely the best Chinese food on this side of town. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"5 Stars for \"Old School\"   Americanized Chinese food, in an authentic  funky retro Chinese restaurant environment.  Fresh, flavorful, and priced right.    My husband and I were sans children, and wanted something close to home, but different than our usual haunts.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Dragon Palace a try.    What a great find!  I have seen this place before, when at the Quiltz shop at the end of the little strip center.  I am glad to try any hole in the wall or oddball place, but having had too much bad Chinese in the past, will usually not try one unless it comes with a recommendation by someone.    Hot tea and ice water arrived immediately.  We ordered 2 Dragon Dinner Specials- I the Almond Chicken, my husband the Mongolian Beef.  Evil, delicious little crunchy fried wonton strips showed up after we placed the order.  The Wor-Wonton soup arrived first- hot, and delicious. Beautiful clean shrimp were so flavorful, and the veggies and wontons were perfect.    The eggrolls were crisp and fresh.  The chicken drumette was crisp and flavorful.   Our entrees were so good, reminding me of the old fashioned Chinese restaurants I went to with my parents in late 60's-early 70's.  (Anyone remember Toy's Shangri La??)       Service was pleasant and non-obtrusive.  Here's an observation I made:  there was NO HINT of anything that had been frozen and added back into any dish.  I hate it when places do this!  The only downside was that we got NO banana wonton desserts!  I think it was because we arrived around 8:15 and they closed at 9, and were closing up the kitchen.  Now we HAVE to go back so we can try some other entrees and those little sweet morsels."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal here. It wasn't fantastic but definitely good enough for me to want to come back and try some different selections. I had the Hawaiian Chicken. Portion size wasn't huge but was quite acceptable. Service was friendly and quick and time to prepare the food was good, considering that it was prepared fresh. I liked it and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was searching for a good Chinese food place. Was honestly a little off put by the exterior of the restaurant but once we sat down and were served I was happy! Pretty typical Chinese food, nothing spectacular but the prices were awesome! We will be returning."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Chinese restaurant for at least 20 years. It is always great. The sweet-and-sour chicken, egg foo young, egg-rolls, soups, honey walnut shrimp your name it, we are always very pleased. I have never had any issues eating, they always get As on their health reports and are even or on the Dean's list!"}
{"text":"Our go-to for Chinese take out used to be Nee House. But as the years went by, their portions got smaller and their prices got higher. So it was time to find another restaurant.  Little did we know this AMAZING place was so close to our house! The great reviews online convinced us to try it.  The owner takes pride in all their dishes and goes overboard to please the customer.  Their ingredients are SO fresh. And the sauces are super-flavorful. All the meats are moist -- and that's hard to do with chicken. No matter what you order, you will be happy!  We will never go back to NH. We are Dragon Palace fans forever. And we've spread the word to everybody we know."}
{"text":"I called and order food and picked it up during the lunch hours, but I was charged the full price not the lunch price. I spend $32 on a little bit of chicken and a little bit of shrimp and 2 things of white rice. I wasn't even given the option of having fried rice instead of white rice. When we called to express our dissatisfaction, they simply said \"We did ask. Sorry about that.\" We will definitely be going back to Tai Pei."}
{"text":"Disappointing  The menu was the standard oriental fare. The entrees were delivered quickly and at the proper temperatures. We did not find any \"must try\" dishes on the menu or on the list of in  house specials. The service was good, the food however, was not good.   On our First visit we had the, chicken chow mein, lemon chicken, fried rice, eggrolls, and egg drop soup. The egg drop soup was tasty, served piping hot and had a nice flavor. However, the chicken chow mein, lemon chicken, and eggrolls were not as expected. The coating on the lemon chicken was crunchy but the chicken was very dry and chewy not moist at all, as was the chicken in the chow mein.  The eggrolls were just okay, not memorable, and the steamed rice was somewhat on the cold side and lacked any flavor. The meal just wasnt very good.  Maybe, I went on an off day.  The service was geeat, the servings are plenty, and the prices are wallet friendly.  I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"I have been in the Valley for over 40 years and I have to say, this was the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. I ordered the Almond Chicken and not only was the serving size small, and the chicken small dark meat squares, but it was so salty that I could not eat it. I sent it back. I then ordered Chicken w snow peas. This, at least looked appetizing. But, looks were deceiving. It to was too salty.  Needles to say, I didn't eat it either. I took it home and promptly dumped it in the trash. I have no idea how this place could possibly rate 4 stars. Plus the atmosphere is horrible and the staff very unfriendly.  Give me Wok Express or Flo's anytime. I only gave it one star because the soup was OK, otherwise I wouldn't have given it any."}
{"text":"Food here was just ok, and I'm pretty sure they are using MSG still. Every dish (including the house special chicken over which everyone was raving) was heavily salted and just plain bland tasting. Three stars awarded for quick and attentive service and reasonable prices. But I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Dragon Palace has become our go-to place when the family is itching for some Americanized Chinese food.    Like other Yelpers have noted, it's tucked away in a very diverse strip mall.  Yes, it's slightly ghetto, but I live down the street so I'm not scurred.  The servers are *very* attentive, almost aggressively so (not necessarily in a bad way).  They get the food to the table quickly, and I've never had anything that wasn't good.  The banana/honey wontons are amazing!    A bonus is that my picky eater always finds something that she likes here and she finds herself trying things she wouldn't normally try."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for Chinese food yesterday, so I thought I would try Dragon Palace based off of the Yelp reviews. I ordered the Sichuan Tofu because I saw a picture of the Sichuan Beef on Yelp (submitted by the restaurant) and it looked delicious with the bamboo shoots and other veggies. When my dinner arrived, it was just a bunch of silken tofu floating in a bland, viscous sauce with no vegetables. It was so unappetizing that I couldn't eat it. The photos submitted by the restaurant are misleading, and I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have been craving authentic Chinese food for awhile now and this definitely hit the spot.  Excellent food and great service. This definitely just became one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food in the area. Forget Jimmy Wans and Tai Pei. Cheesy name aside, Dragon Palace is authentic and delicious.   Ho fun noodles are fresh, flavorful and not too greasy. The diced chicken with fried pepper has a wonderful crunch with a spicy salt and pepper kick.   Looking forward to trying more things on the menu next time. If you're tired of the tired Americanized Chinese cuisine scattered around the greater fox chapel area, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"DRAGON PALACE!  30 years in the same spot.  The best Chinese in town hands down. Hot and Sour soup, Mandarin Hot Beef, Mu Shu Pork, Garlic Shrimp. A+"}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly owners. Lunch specials are awesome price and very tasty. They give soup egg roll and hot tea with your choice of entree. Its always hot fresh and a lot of food. We are there once a week if not more. You will be too :)"}
{"text":"One word, \"Awful\". Nuff said. I ordered the crispy duck and the honey walnut chicken. Never seen duck and honey walnut chicken look not taste like this. I couldn't believe what they handed me as food. Terrible! This place made Panda Express look like authentic Asian cuisine. My duck was so dry and fatty. The walnut chicken was all lard covered. Ugh I'm getting a stomach ache reliving this awful experience. How this place got four stars is beyond me. I would've given negative stars if it were an option. This place is fuckin nasty bro"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is fantastic! We live about 4 miles away and it is definitely our go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Really I did. The Yelp reviews were good, so I decided to give it a try.  When I came to pick up our order, the hostess at the front was very nice and there were many people in the restaurant.  I brought the order home, and it was all correct. I like the fact they put each container in a little plastic bag to cut down on leaks and spills. Plus they give you almond cookies and fortune cookies with your order.  But the food. Ugh! Unfortunately, it examples the worst of Americanized Chinese food. None of our four dishes - Mongolian beef, cashew chicken, kung pao chicken and house fried rice - really had any flavor, except the beef, which tasted of flour.  So disappointing! Won't be going back. One star for being pleasant and one for the packaging and almond cookies. That's it."}
{"text":"We found Dragon Palace thanks to excellent Yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint! It is like a little hidden gem tucked in the deep corner of an almost empty strip mall. We have lived in the neighborhood for several years but never noticed the restaurant as we drove by on 32nd Street. It is a gen worth seeking out for delicious Chinese takeout.   When I called in my order on a Saturday night we were thrilled to hear it would be ready for pickup within 10 minutes--wonderful! The good was ready promptly and was very affordable. We ordered 5 items and were charged less than $50, and had PLENTY of food for our group of 5, with adequate leftovers for the next day. Yum! The Peking Fried Rice was a favorite (so full of delicious meat), as well as the Mongolian Beef (so flavorful).  The decor inside the restaurant is festive and inviting. Best of all, the owners are friendly, professional, and greeted us warmly when we came to pick up the food. Thank you, Dragon Palace! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a nice little \"gem of a restaurant\" to answer our craving for Asian  food!  Thanks Yelpers!!!  The food and service at this place are China-licious!  The prices are just $, a bargain!  The Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!  Restaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.    Service~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.  Food~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!    Their menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say \"we are going to go and eat Chinese\" and I would say \"mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?\"    After a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.  All of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!  I'm looking forward to going \"Back in Time\" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there."}
{"text":"Gave it two stars because the service is so good. Called for take out and they knew what they were doing, understood me and all was good, service with a smile too.   Ordered the B meal for two, so egg rolls, S+S chicken balls, chicken chow mein and chicken fried rice. Food is poor at best. Monumentally bland (and I am not a SPICE ON EVERYTHING guy), no flavour at all. Chow mein is light on the chicken to say the least and the chicken balls are all breading.  Will not try them again."}
{"text":"I tried this place out all because of Shane's ROTD and yep it lived up to its greatness. I ordered a appetizer platter, twice cooked pork and pork fried rice. (Apparently I was craving pork which is beyond rare) Man all of the food was really good. The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness, the honey chicken was finger-licking good, there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container. My goodness was it stuffed. The only disappointment was the twice cooked pork. Don't get me wrong it was good, but when I ask for extra, extra spicy, that is exactly what I am expecting and it fell short. :(  But will it stop me from going back,? heck no. I am already thinking about what I will be ordering this coming weekend."}
{"text":"VERY dissatisfied and disappointed with this establishment, I have been going here for a while now and they seem like decent people and the food was decent up until last night when I started eating my food and there was a bunch of egg shell in it, so I didn't eat it, I called and told the owner or manager, his reply was bring the food in from last night and show him the egg shell, are you joking me? Not only have you lost a customer and customers, now you have lost a devoted customer over what, because you didn't want to make a customers order right and basically accuse them of lying? I have spent countless money, hard earned money in your inflated priced establishment and now you have lost it over an order of chicken fried rice lol what a disgrace!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years and it is always a wonderful experience.  Their food is wonderful... the staff is great... and the meals are decently priced and large enough to share with everybody in your party.  Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place, with such good reviews. First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.)   When we got our takeout home, we were hopeful. All of my fellow Yelper's reviews were so glowing. Now I'm convinced that every person who rated it with 5 stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies- but I'm not sure as we didn't eat in.   Our food was inedible. I'm serious- and usually once I've shelled out a few bucks for something I'll at least hunker down and eat it, but instead I'd rather go hungry tonight. And my husband will eat ANYTHING, so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that I'm not just some crazy snob who doesn't like the food (and Chinese is never a bad choice for me, I've never given up.) The sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Bland and mushy. The schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken. Tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed (not fresh at all), and in some sort of spicy-ketchup sauce. The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating, but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap. I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for \"Chicken of the Sea.\" Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza.   Never again will I eat here. They were SO nice- SO nice. That's about the only remarkable thing about this place. Unlike other Yelpers, I would try ANY other place in the valley before returning for more of the same here."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for more than 20 years, and just found this place. Wish I'd of known of it before. The food is consistently delicious. Since we found out that they were right down the street, we have eaten here half a dozen times. Only once were we not overly impressed, and it was a take out order, on a busy night.   Worth trying if you are in the mood for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Having moved from Seattle to Phoenix, I ate for many years in the International District and know how good Chinese food is supposed to taste. The Dragon Palace does a great job with most of my favorite dishes!   The A ratings from the County Health Inspector paper the wall when you walk in, inspiring confidence!  Service is quick and accurate.   Our favorites... Wor Wonton Soup crammed with seafood, and wontons. Yummy anytime but especially when you are sick! We always send the other person out to pick this up when we get a cold.  Mongolian Beef is fork tender and the Lo Mein (pan fried soft noodle) dishes are filling and delicious. I don't understand why the AZ Republic food critics don't include this place on their \"Best Chinese\" list! Tell them to get in there!"}
{"text":"I am excited to have a new restaurant in our neighborhood and tried it on opening day. They did a great job with the interior and it was clean and decorated nicely. The menu was well thought out in my opinion. Prices are reasonable and the location is great as we really don't have many good quality food choices to pick from yet that we can walk to. It was so nice to be able to walk to get good food. The egg rolls and dumplings were some of the best I've ever had. They weren't greasy and I love they have an authentic menu as well as healthy options. I really liked the eggplant I ordered. The portions were generous and I have some left for 2 more meals! My husband ordered food off of the authentic menu and really liked it. It will be my go-to for Chinese food and Sharpsburg definitely deserves a great restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"Felt the urge for some good Chinese food without having to sit uncomfortably at a restaurant. I checked yelp to find some local restaurants to get my fix and came across the dragon palace.   After logging onto their website and taking a look at their menu it looked pretty standard so I called them up and placed my order. The person on the phone spoke great English (Ive ordered from other Chinese restaurants and had a troubles) so placing my order was super easy. They asked me how long I wanted my food in and if it was for delivery or pickup.  Within 15 minutes I was at the dragon palace it was really easy to find located directly on Dundas and there was a lot of parking. I found out as per their menu that if you pay cash they give you 10% off which made me really happy. All the food was neatly packed in a large paper bag. They packed up forks and knives along with napkins and a variety of sauces for my food. I was really please with my food and would definitely go back!!! I had left overs for days there was a lot food."}
{"text":"After seeing Amy P's review of this place I had to give my own. If you have read my other reviews it is plain to see I think I know what I am talking about when it comes to food. So, being a true NYer and a good Jew I love Chinese food. It's Kosher, right? Anyway, I have had my fair share of it and Dragon Palace stands up to almost all of it, save Chinese food in Seattle.   It is located in the corner of a strip mall, which Megan M pointed out is a little shady. Couldn't be more spot on. There is a bar in the opposite corner and run-down looking car wash close by. Putting that aside it is your stereotypical Chinese restaurant. It smells great when you walk in and there are a couple of cheap candy and toy machines right when you walk in. You are always greeted by the owner, who speaks passable and sometimes unintelligible English. Most of the time I am picking up food to go, but when I have eaten here the service has been very quick and attentive. It is good for big groups too.  No matter what you like in the way of Chinese food you will find it here. Everything I have eaten has been very good. The soups, appetizers, and main dishes are all consistent each time I order them, which is what I look for in a good eatery.   My favorites include the egg rolls, wonton soup, mo shu pork, house special chicken, mongolian beef, and lemon chicken.  The only thing that bugs me about this place, is what gets my Dad riled up every time we order from them. So after getting food from here for about 10 years my Dad started to notice that the bill was always ending in .0, .05, or .10 increments. So, this one time my Dad decided to figure out the bill himself, tax and all. When we went to pick up the food he argued with the owner for about 10 minutes about the fact that they were rounding up on the tax. It may have only been a few cents, but it pissed my Dad off. The owner said that they \"don't deal in penny.\" My Dad retorted with, \"Well the IRS does.\" The owner told him he was a big problem and would remember his name. He proceeded to storm off and cuss my Dad out in Chinese. To this day my Dad doesn't use his name to place pick up orders. It is still a running joke in my family. After all this we still order from them."}
{"text":"The egg drop is the best!  We have not had one bad meal yet. From start to finish... Darn good"}
{"text":"So five stars for the food. I will be coming here to order take out. The service, the environment and ambiance is a different story. We came with our baby and we felt so unwelcome. They offered a high chair and it was the most unsafe and annoying high chair I've ever seen. It came with a silver pan tray so anytime she pounded on the tray, it would make this loud sound that bounced off the walls. It was quite annoying and people in the restaurant seemed annoyed too. So we told the waitress we will just order take out, which made us feel more awkward while we waited for our food and service practically ended while the employees just watched us - my hubby sitting down in the booth and me trying to console my fussy daughter, walking in the front of the restaurant. Awkward.   We ordered the shrimp fried rice, the shrimp with lobster sauce and house special beef. The food was delicious! The fried rice had whole, tender, succulent shrimps. I was pretty satisfied. I just know I'll be just ordering take out and not dining in next time."}
{"text":"I think I have found my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix! Dragon Palace is everything I think of when it comes to Chinese food. The restaurant is full of traditional decorations and of course those large red booths. (They have tables too). Soft Chinese music playing in the background and some artwork.   Let's move on to the food...Dragon Palace has Mandarin and Szechuan dishes. The food is so good that I came in two weeks in a row.   We started with fried meat dumplings and crab puffs. Oh both are delicious and served with sweet and sour and hot chili sauces. We also had sizzling rice soup. One of the best Chinese soups I have ever had with chicken, shrimp and veggies. They also bring out complimentary fried wonton strips with dipping sauce to every table.   For dinner we had house special chicken which is lightly fried chicken breast sautéed in \"special sauce\". I don't know what this special sauce is, but I would drink it if I could. Yummy!  We also tried the sautéed happy family which is chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops and Chinese veggies all together covered in a brown sauce. Delicious! The brown sauce has a great flavor and is slightly sweet. They also don't skimp on any of the meat or seafood. I was impressed!   We did not try dessert, but they bring out complimentary banana wontons covered in honey with the check. Oh these are good!! Can I have more than one please!?  Another thing to mention is the full bar. When I go out for Chinese food I never think of ordering a cocktail. Dragon Palace had a pretty impressive cocktail menu. I didn't have a cocktail, but several people in the restaurant did and the drinks looks really good. I'll be sure to try one next time!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very excited for this addition to Sharpsburg. We ordered the Singapore rice noodles, my daughter's favorite, and it was excellent! Look forward to trying more of their options very soon. The dining area is decent--it's a converted pizza place. Good for a family night out or to grab some delicious takeout. Welcome to the neighborhood, Dragon Palace!"}
{"text":"Great food! A little expensive but I don't mind treating my family once in a while friendly staff place seems clean,"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We were recommended this place. WOW We will be back again! Everything we had was awesome! I had Shrimp Egg Foo Young patties. Boyfriend had Shrimp fried rice, Sesame chicken. We also got egg rolls!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the price is right. They are fast and always quite friendly."}
{"text":"Not the same restaurant from a few years back.  We went on Christmas Eve and the food was horrible. Restroom smells foul.  The whole place did moot feel clean"}
{"text":"Dragon Palace is your stereotypical, neighborhood Chinese restaurant. It's back in the corner of a shady looking strip mall, which doesn't exactly draw you in. The restaurant itself is decorated with rather gaudy, gold and red decorations, complete with red paper lanterns.  Although I don't come here for the atmosphere, I wish one of these days they'd put a sound system in and play some background music. Despite the less-than-elegant decor, this restaurant has a certain charm to it.  I've been coming here with my family for about 20 years and it's still my restaurant of choice for Chinese food. The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty, but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup. It's thick, flavorful and I have yet to find a rival anywhere. Great dishes include the Mongolian beef, cashew chicken and house special chicken. Americans everywhere have their favorite, must order Chinese food dish and I'm willing to bet you'll find a pleasant version of it at Dragon Palace.   The best time to go is at lunch! It's quick and cheap. Their lunches, which come with a generous helping of your choice of dish (say kung pao chicken), rice, egg roll, 2 wontons and either egg drop or wonton soup are less than $6, most around $5. If you're REALLY on a budget, order a bowl of egg drop soup for only $1.   The only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these!   If you're craving Chinese food, stop and eat here or pick up a to-go order and eat it in whatever environment you choose!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and excellent food!  Everything we've ordered has been great.  Our favorites, include the \"Happy Family\" (seafood menu), cheese puffs, veggie egg rolls, Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken,  fried rice, and garlic chicken.  We feel the portions are generous and the prices very reasonable.  If you haven't tried it, we recommend you do!"}
{"text":"First off....I'm a rabbit! This according to every Chinese Zodiac.  I like being a rabbit. My opposite.....the cock! My wife apparently is a cock. So for eighteen years I have loved .....well, my Wife!   Dragon Palace has been around for a VERY long time. I remeber going there as a child and loving it. One of my daughters has been in gymnastics just west of this restaurant and I keep wanting to eat here again and I continually drive by without stopping. My family generally eats at Nee-House or Jade Palace but the nostalgia here had my curiousity piqued.   This past weekend I made an executive choice. \"Family\" I said, \"We are going to Dragon Palace tonight for dinner\" I was so excited. This was going to be a huge throwback to my childhood. So we arrive and so goes!  We walk up to two Chinese Red colored doors. I remember these doors being gigantic, not so big anymore when you are 6' tall. I open the door for my family to enter and the wonderfull smell wafed by my nose. Just the smell I remember, a true chinese smell. When we entered there was an old Chinese man at the front counter. I wonder if he was here 25 years ago? The lanterns adorned the rooftop just like I remember back in the eighties. Pink and blue hues were splashed on the walls. No frills, just the iconic, eclectic and stereotypical Chinese joint. So far everything is great. Now the food has to be good. And it was. I must say I was peased big time. I am a very adventurous eater usually. NOT TONIGHT. I wanted simple traditional Americanized chines fair and they hit on all levels. Wor Wonton Soup, Egg Foo Yung, Mongollion Beef, Orange Chicken, Low Mein (house), Crab Puff and Egg Rolls. Easy comfort stuff. It was very good, very fresh.   Dragon Palace always served a \"treat\" at the end of the meal. Ice Cream usually. Now it appears they serve a new and even better treat after the meal. Get this, Banana, wrapped in wonton skin, deep fried and drizzled with honey. Crispy, Chewy, Golden and sweet. Those little chats are off the map. Loved it and we will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, delivered. Super friendly staff. We've ordered 3 times and it hasn't missed a beat once. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pros: good value for money lots of choices and variety  Very prompt service Owner came by to see if we were having a good experience   Cons :  Location not very appealing  Staff not very friendly.   Had the Dragon Dinner Special. For 2. Mongollian beef, tender beef with scallions, a bit on the bland side but I like spicy, so I fixed it by adding chili oil and all was great. Really good Fried rice. Egg roll and honey chicken wing, all started with work won ton soup.  We also had house special chicken.  Very good.  Will go back."}
{"text":"It's great food.  Meal includes Hot Tea shouldn't all Chinese restaurants include hot tea. Just saying!! All the classic dishes, clean and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of hot and sour soup, and a bit of a snob about it since I have eaten so much of it. At first I didn't think I would like the soup when it came out because I tend to like broth that is darker and richer looking, and this broth seemed a little light for my tastes (I want a hybrid broth + sauce) but it was delicious! Flavorful and chock full of good things, I was definitely a fan. I also got some fried dumplings that were pretty good, although there's a place in Huntington Beach that makes them just the way I like them and I have yet to find a good replacement, and my brother got a beef dish that he really enjoyed. All in all it was a good experience, very authentic, and the people were nice albeit not overly friendly."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here to grab a take-away for dinner, because we looked up prices online and Dragon Palace seemed really affordable, and we didn't really want fast food.  I had a dinner combo that came with chicken fried rice, General Tso's chicken, chicken chow mein, and an egg roll; he had sweet and sour chicken balls, chicken fried rice, and switched out his chow mein for noodles since he couldn't switch out his rice. We both had egg rolls that had a vegetarian filling. The service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant's interior was lovely so we'll definitely eat inside the place next time.  The food itself was quite good and came in huge portions, considering we paid around 20 dollars for two meals. My partner got three chicken balls and a container of sauce, and our egg rolls were hot and crispy. I think the best thing we had was the General Tso's chicken, so we shared that and we'll definitely get that again next time. The sauces were all flavourful, the rice wasn't dry and awful, the chow mein was crisp and fresh, and the chicken was tender. The only issues we had with our food was that there were bits of chicken cartilage in the rice (some people like that, I know,  it's just a personal thing), and my partner said that the noodles stuck together a wee bit.   I would probably purchase two dishes next time, instead of the combos-- General Tso's chicken or sweet and sour chicken (or shrimp, or beef!) and a different noodle dish.  Also, if you need cutlery in your take-away bag, make sure to tell the waiter!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were craving some Chinese food, so I yelped the closest location with the best reviews. This one popped up and I'm glad it did. I never really expect too much going to a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, but this place was good.  We ordered the cream cheese wontons for an appetizer. They came out fast and were fresh! Also, was a big serving.  We came during lunch so we received egg drop soup before our meal as well.  I had the sesame chicken while my boyfriend had the orange chicken. Both were tasty! And again came with a lot of food. Lot of the chicken, fried rice, an egg roll, and two wontons.  Lots of good food and a check of $20. Yes please!  Good place if you're hungry and on a budget."}
{"text":"Chinese has always been a bit of a tricky cuisine for me to review. Admittedly, this is partially due to my own ignorance, thanks to my parents excluding Chinese from the five or six restaurants we kept in continuous rotation during family dinner outings. It also has a lot to do with the fact that Chinese food, at least the American-influenced style we're most familiar with, hasn't really evolved much. Yes, there are corporate chains that suburban families flock to, as well as these so-called \"modern\" spots that simply replace the dragon décor with IKEA furnishings and big screen TVs. But is the food really all that different? When you think about it, pizza, burgers, and even Mexican food all have their fair share of changes over the years. But I rarely see or hear about any \"high-end\" Chinese restaurants, nor have I found much variation in the types of food available. It's all pretty traditional stuff, which is probably why its once exotic appeal has slowly waned in the last fifty years. The fact that roughly one-third of them are always named \"The Great Wall\" doesn't help matters much.   Wait, where was I? Oh, yes. Dragon Palace. A little family-owned Chinese restaurant that, from what I understand, has been around for quite some time. Located in a seedy looking plaza, it was one of the few Chinese places that popped up with some decent Yelp reviews, so I thought we'd give them a try.  Hey, complimentary tea upon being seated? Nice touch!  My girlfriend and I ordered a sampler platter, which consisted of two wontons, honey dipped chicken legs, egg rolls, and jumbo fried shrimp. Unfortunately, the wontons tasted stale, as if they had been sitting around for far too long. The egg rolls weren't too far off. In my opinion, these are the basic of the most basic items - and if something is wrong with them, that's probably not a good sign. Hell, if the Vietnamese and Thai crew, people that shamefully stole these items from the Chinese menu can do them right, why can't this place?  Our entrees were delivered shortly thereafter, quickly slapped down on the edge of the table by the server - similar to a barista plunking down a couple of iced coffees on the counter before running back to make another drink during the middle of a mad rush.  Typically, when I eat Chinese, I usually play it safe by ordering beef and broccoli and rarely deviate out of sheer fear. However, for once, I attempted to change things up by ordering their Kung Pao Chicken. I took about three bites and immediately surrendered. I still can't put my finger on what it was, but something, whether it be the peanuts, or some kind of strange oyster-like sauce, just gave the meat this very bizarre aftertaste that I strongly disliked.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken chow mein. Half was offered to me out of pity, due to my immediate dismissal of my Pao. It wasn't too bad, but nothing that I would order for myself. Once again, I can't really put my finger on why, it just seemed rather bland.  You also receive the traditional bowl of rice. Eh - rice is rice. I can make it in my microwave in six minutes, but it's there if you want it.  They serve a couple of complimentary banana fritters at the end of the meal, which I'll admit, was a charming move - especially since most Chinese restaurants don't seem too big on offering desserts. They were okay, but probably would have tasted better hot, as fried bananas typically do. Then again, they were free, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  Overall, I was not really impressed, which really now has me wondering who serves the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Allegedly, according to my girlfriend, the best Chinese restaurants are actually found in Mexico of all places - a belief that a colleague of mine also strongly supports. From what I've been reading, there's actually a quiet movement in Central Phoenix to give Chinese cuisine a bit of a boost - although I haven't quite experienced this just yet.  Ultimately, this just wasn't my type of place. Although reading some of the reviews, they seem to have their fair share of longtime fans, so take my opinion with a grain of salt - or in this case, a grain of MSG."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Lots of flavor and minimal grease. My husband usually orders beef and broccoli and I always get their veggie egg foo young. Perfect comfort food. Great friendly service too! Slightly pricier than other Chinese restaurants but well worth the quality. And the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 20 years. I am never disappointed, they have the best Hot and Sour soup I have ever had. I have moved to California and every time I come back to Phoenix I always stop in for my fix. The family that owns and runs Dragon Palace are kind and always remember me even when it has been 6 months since my last visit. I always feel welcome they always have a smile and genuine interest in my satisfaction with the meal. Great service, great menu and great prices make this one of my favorite meal spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery  Came on time  Cantonese chow mien was great :) not soggy, good mix of veg and meat,  Hot and sour soup... WAS TERRIBLE... good portion and broth.. but it was all broth 2 pieces of tofu and some mushrooms... and I ordered 2. Not happy for 4$ each if was a true hot and sour soup would be great"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for over 4 years and tried this place for the first time tonight.  It was fantastic!  The owners were friendly and the food was delicous and fresh.  I have been searching for a chinese restaurant to call my \"regular\" place and I think I have found it.  Exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Their Chicken fried rice and egg rolls are the best in the Valley!! We have been going their for 20+ years and the food is always sooo good.  It is never greasy and is consistent every time."}
{"text":"Just finished eating take-out from this place.  I can honestly say that the food was extremely flavourful and fresh tasting.  We over ordered as is typical with a new restaurant, but the meal was still quite affordable.  The delivery driver was friendly and fast.  Overall a great first experience!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a child (and it hasn't changed at all). I loved it then and I still love it now.  My favorite dishes are the Mongolian Beef and Almond Chicken, but they have plenty of other great dishes. They have a great lunch menu and very generous portions. Come hungry. Their dinners are served family style. The restaurant is a little dark and could use some new, updated decor.  Be sure to check out the huge mural on the north wall."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to stumble upon this place while we were across at Joe's Grotto. Little red door just in the corner of the complex, but man was it a great discovery! The food here is superb, reminiscent of the Chinese restaurants we frequented when living in L.A. Food is served quickly along with tea. We always get the Peking Dinner because it's such a great value for how much food you get! There's always enough for lunch the next day and you know that Chinese food is always good the next day!"}
{"text":"Read the online reviews and now it's the only Chinese place for us! The egg drop is awesome- I only got based on another yelp recommendation, I normally do not like Chinese soups. It's so good! My husband gets the chicken fried rice and I'm hooked on the mu shu pork."}
{"text":"This was my husband's second visit and my first to Dragon Palace.  The first time my husband went he came home excited about having a good Chinese place so close to us (and let me clarify that we are both American born Chinese so we love greasy Chinese food).    I love that right after we sit down they bring the tea, and there's no extra charge like a lot of Chinese restaurants these days.  This place does offer a great deal for a LOT of food -- we went with the Family Dinner special which was 11.95 a person for soup, eggroll, fried wontons, pork chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.  By the time the entrees came around we were totally full and we ended up taking three full cartons of food home.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.    However, I thought that the food here was very difficult to eat.  The chow mein especially was really, really salty.  I never ever send food back but we had to ask for them to cook it again because it was so salty, and it wasn't much better after that.  The sweet and sour pork was deep fried pork with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over it -- not even coated evenly.  The meat itself was tough and chewy in texture.  The fried rice was decent, nothing extraordinary.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert, they make these fried bananas wrapped in wontons that are coated with honey and they are delicious!  Since my husband had such a positive experience the first time he went, I am willing to give this place another try.  Maybe they just hired a new chef (our server said that he was also brand new) so there may be some inconsistencies in the menu."}
{"text":"One of my Uber eats meals, Uber Eats may be a reason to ever live my house to get mown takeout. So by saying that I can only review the food and not the service or the actual restaurant but none the less this is just good Chinese takeout.  Dragon Palace is what you would expect from a Chinese Takeout place, fast and tasty with huge portions. When I get Chinese takeout I expect a good portion for cheap. We ordered Chicken Lo-Mein, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Pad Thai and Hot and Sour soup.   The Lo-Mein was good typical shiny lo-mein no better no worse then any other place it didn't really stand out but I'd recommend it if you are in the mood for lo-mein.   The Chilli Chicken was stand out!! It was great! Perfectly spiced and still great after being warmed up (twice) if you only wanted one dish this is what i'd suggested. Its some of the best chilli chicken I've gotten from a take out place in a long time. Definitely one of my favourites.  The Chicken Pad Thai was again alright, not too great but its not a Thai restaurant so my expectations weren't that high. I probably would recommend against this since its more just like chicken and noodles.  The Hot and Sour Soup was below average. I have my favourite Chinese restaurants a few blocks north of me and they serve an amazing hot and sour soup so this one was a bit of a disappointment in comparison.  Honestly I can't complain much as its what i would expect from Chinese takeout. I might order from here again but there are a few other places I'd like to try first. I'll be ordering the chilli chicken again for sure though!"}
{"text":"Service was great!  Portions are huge!!!! Try the lemon chicken and you will be in love"}
{"text":"Since moving back to Arizona from California 5 years ago, we've tried out many Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  This is one of the best that we've found so far.    The decor is a bit tired with a little TOO teal walls.  In fact, when I eat there I find myself thinking of simple ways to update the interior to make the restaurant a bit more fresh and friendly.  Dark decor aside, the service is great, the food very tasty and the prices quite reasonable.  My husband and I often pick up take-out to eat at home and our favorites are the \"Sauteed Happy Family\", \"Crystal Shrimp\"  and the \"BBQ Sliced Pork\" appetizer.  The \"Moo Shu Pork\" is also delicious and the PuPu Platter for 2 at $7.50 is a smokin' deal!  This spot is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for Chinese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven by this place a thousand times and never gave it a thought because of it's location, a slightly ghetto strip mall.  Thanks to you Yelper's we braved the location.  (on a side note, this ghetto strip mall has an Irish Dance Studio, Fencing Studio, A Toy store that is gotta be seen to be believed and Joe's Grotto featuring a stage for bands.)  Walking through the big red doors entering the restaurant I was suddenly flashing back to childhood memories of my families favorite Chinese restaurant in CT circa 1965.  Same decor, reds, blues, big red banquets, and complete with gold dragon's!    The owner is really nice!  He has been in this same location since 1979.  I only know of a handful of restaurants that have stayed in business in the valley that long.  He gets 4 stars just for that!!  The menu has all the regular \"americanized\" Chinese dishes....sweet and sour pork, egg foo yung, chow mein, mu shu, etc....will be back again to find our favorites on the menu.  We had the fried dumplings, bo bo shrimp, peking fried rice and house special fried chicken.  Everything was fresh and tasty!   This is one of the better \"americanized\" Chinese restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Great quality, delicious food. We are so happy to have a great Chinese restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Chinese places Ive tried. I love take out and delivery Chinese for some reason, this place was great to eat in. Would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Bland.  My \"hot\" bean curd was anything but--had to cover it in sriracha.  My husband's hot and sour soup was nothing like any hot and sour he'd ever had (and not in a good way).  The mushrooms looked canned and the chicken in the hot & sour soup was oddly rubbery.  This place over Americanizes their food and it makes me miss east coast Chinese.  We're keeping our hopes up that we'll find \"our\" Chinese take out place in Phoenix, but the outlook isn't good if Dragon Palace is worthy of 4 stars! One up side: ridiculous amount of food for a really good price."}
{"text":"I have been going to this excellent hole-in-the-wall family run Chinese restaurant for 20 years. I introduced my wife to it a few years ago, and we go about once a month since. It is better than any place else you can find and the prices are excellent. Get the Dragon Dinner Special for enough food for leftovers for days, for $15 a person!"}
{"text":"When me and my wife think Chinese food this is the place we go... Always. It's so good and really quick. Never waiting long for your food. Love this place."}
{"text":"We visit this place about once a month.  My husband is a superfan of Dragon Palace.  He absolutely loves their shrimp fried rice.  I love the banana fritter (???? - someone posted a pic of this - not sure of the name) that comes at the end of the meal.  We both love the hot tea that is served with each meal and we always order the egg drop soup.  One of my faves is the beef skewer.  It's beef on a stick that comes out on this thing with fire underneath it so you heat the skewer how you like.  I'm not sure what to call that thing but I love to get my skewers sizzling hot.  I keep trying new items each time I go and some of faves are the Orange Chicken, Pepper Steak and Sesame Chicken.  They serve it with a pot of white rice.  Each dinner entree is served on an oval plate and is enough food for at least two people....more if you eat small.  I always have leftovers, as I order the entrees for myself (hubby eats Shrimp Fried Rice always).  Service is always super fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food.  The staff is nice and the decor is a very cozy Chinese look.  This a little gem in our neighborhood.  See you there!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!   I have been here a couple of times. Tonight was the first time I ordered take out.  My food was ready in 10 minutes!  They packaged it up with care and added a round cookie and a sugar cookie. I ordered the orange chicken and the crab Rangoon. Both where super delicious. I have plenty left over!!  The orange chicken had nice size pieces of juicy chicken breast lightly breaded and not overly spicy.  I do love the decor in here!!  It's quirky but that's what makes it cool!  The only bummer about take out is you don't get the wonderful banana wontons everyone raved about but I'm sure they'd throw it in if you asked!!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our food (Green Pepper Beef & Shrimp Egg Foo Yung) was very disappointing last night. Therefore we will not be returning to the Dragon Palace. The beef in the Green Pepper Beef did not even taste like beef and the chunks of green pepper were too large and the flavor didn't blend very well with the dish. The patties in the egg foo yung were dry and tasteless. The service was good but the place was freezing. I know the valley has had its share of  cold weather lately but even the servers were wearing jackets & sweatshirts & the bench in the booth was ice cold! I had heard great things about this place and really wanted to like it but it was not to be. The search goes on for the type of  american style chinese food in the valley I prefer."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner with my husband, Sunday night, not too busy. Service was ok. We ordered dumplings and teriyaki beef sticks as appetizers, it was pretty good. Then came the entrees, pork fried rice was just ok (some rice not fully cooked at the bottom of the plate) Crispy duck .... $13 entree to get a bunch of pieces of over fried duck put on a plate, mostly fried skin and bones. They cut the bites with the bones in it, so you either have to pull the meat off or spit the bones chunks out as you're chewing on it... I was so disappointed after a good start with the appetizers. Won't go back, overpriced. Still on the hunt for a good Chinese food place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to dragon palace for more than twenty one years. We have never ordered anything that was not delicious. The people that serve the food are very friendly and very welcoming. I like the lemon chicken in my mother likes the shrimp with lobster sauce. My dad likes the Mongolian beef and my friend likes pork chow mein 5 stars"}
{"text":"Quick service , but nothing write home about.  Food bland, nice portions , but nothing was tasty.  Just...blah..."}
{"text":"Visited Dragon Palace while visiting my daughter in Phoenix.  Service was quick and courteous.  Food was okay, nothing spectacular.  Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst I've ever had.  I would come back here again for a safe meal when I'm in the mood for Chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely horrible. We had issues with every thing ordered except the iced tea. The food is completely unflavored, salty, and low quality.  We ordered the Mandarin family dinner which was a bundle of appetizers and entrees. The issues listed below were addressed with the manager/owner but he made excuses for the problems and did not attempt to correct. I would not recommend this restaurant in any way shape or form to anyone for fear they will be disappointed or sick.  The issues 1. Fried wontons - cold, hard and no filling.  2. Egg rolls - filled with old meat and tasted awful.  3. Egg drop soup was really thick from over cooking 4. The fried rice was full of old and new meat (complemented by the light and dark colors plus an old taste) 5.  The Mongolian beef was the most offensive in taste - super salty and watery (the manager said that's how they do it there). 6. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like donuts deep fried in old oil. The shell of the pastry was crisp but every piece was doughy.  Topping the chicken was a sweet glaze but did not complement the chicken.  7. Stale fortune cookie  The dinner was finished with some odd baklava looking sweet but we were so done with the restaurant that we didn't try it."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite Chinese food in town for sure!   Located in a small ghetto looking strip mall in northern Phoenix, Dragon Palace comes off looking like ever other mom and pop place on town. However, let it be known this is the place to try. Even if it is a bit of a drive for you, it is worth it.   Their food quality of above most places that are comparable in styles. Their menu is huge, anything you could possible want they have, and if it isn't on the menu I am sure the adorable little old man that waits on you will do his best to make you want you want. At lunch time they have a great deal for around $6 you get your choice of entree item that comes with soup, won tons with sweet and sour sauce (my fave!!), an egg roll and either white or brown rice. Way more food than one should eat at once. Not to worry though, the reheating factore is wonderful in this situation!   Check them out. Also, while you wait for you wonderful yummyness to arrive, check out your Chinese horoscope, interesting stuff! :-)"}
{"text":"Favorite place in town I recommend the Mongolian beef or beef chow mein also hit n sour soup !!"}
{"text":"WORST customer service we have EVER received!!! Trust us, the food is NOT worth the horrible service that is provided. I am extremely disappointed in the way that we were treated as customers here. We ordered our food 45 minutes before they closed. The lady continually harassed us on our drive there with multiple phone calls. We arrived (well before close) and were told that they apparently had closed 30 minutes earlier than what not only their website said but also what the lady had confirmed with us on the phone. We will NEVER eat here again. And advise that you do not either."}
{"text":"This was always one of my favorite go to places, but has lost some of its appeal. The food quality is what I would classify as average, not great. Staff is still very friendly. Place is clean. And reasonable prices for a meal. Take a chance, see if you like it. If you do, go back, but if you don't, skip it next time"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars is the location. It was hard to find and the parking lot was completely packed. Maybe reserve a few spots out front for take-out customers? But, the food is so good here, I'd park down the street! Again, Chinese take-out is VERY hit or miss in AZ. This place reminds me of home (NY). I have tried a lot of asian restaurants in the Valley, and Dragon Palace posts up at the top spot! Fast, friendly, and reasonably priced. Try the Peking Fried Rice or Chow Mein, so good. The Orange Peel Beef, and Sesame Chicken are to die for. Beef/Shrimp with Snow Peas, and the House Special Chicken/Shrimp is great. The War Wonton is the best I've ever had. And honestly, I would never have tried this place if not for the other reviewers. The fact that this place has been around this long, and customers have been coming here for years and years and always satisfied; I had to try it out. So glad I did, thank you! This IS my place for Chinese now and later. Really happy to have found this little gem. :)"}
{"text":"When you're hungry but want to stay in? Dragon Palace is the answer! The delivery takes about 45 mins but was all worth it! The serving were big enough for 3-4 people for 1 dish. Cantonese chowmein was delicious. I find the crispy ginger beef too sweet. The spring rolls were nice and crispy not soggy. Everything was hot when delivered! I was very satisfied with my order!"}
{"text":"The food was passable. The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight. Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.  I don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.  The food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out)."}
{"text":"My wife is especially picky about Chinese food and she was very pleased - thus, there is joy in the world.  Exactly as describe in most of the previous reviews... run down looking location (has character;) however the food is really good, when compared to PHX competitors it shines even more. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here last month with my friend. We were so hungry! Greeted fast, sat down and a table we got to pick. Order the pou pou platter to start and it was amazing. Consisted of about 5 mini apps and two of each. For example, two spring rolls, 2 teriyaki wings... for dinner my friend got sesame chicken and I got moo shu chicken. Amazing, flavorful and can not wait to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed take out from here and it was really good! Great service, prices seem to be reasonable compared to others as well. The meat in the fried rice and Lo mein was all really good quality. The food wasn't greasy, and had a lot of taste compared to other Chinese restaurants that seem to have the same taste for everything. We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"This is not a 4 star Yelp restaurant. I use Yelp weekly and this has to be one of the most overrated restaurants I have ever gone to based on Yelp recommendations. The food was mostly inedible. Just awful."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Chinese food this Friday evening in Paradise Valley AZ, so we searched the Internet and came up with DRAGON PALACE, and we're glad we did!  We ordered the Peking Dinner for Two, which included Wor Wonton Soup, Pu Pu Platter, entrees of Mongolian Beef and House Special Chicken, with Peking Fried Rice. I also ordered an appetizer of BBQ Sliced Pork.  Even though the restaurant was crowded, service was really fast - our food was delivered quickly, and everything was delicious - and HUGE! We took home several portions. We were surprised when the check came with fortune cookies and 2 delicious honey-coated wonton skins with a banana slice inside, on the House.  Yummy! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Very good food service very friendly highly recommend it  I got the crispy beef it was awesome"}
{"text":"Wow - a lot of 5 star reviews on the Dragon Palace.  I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a \"sentimental\" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than \"woohoo, as good as it gets\"?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.  In short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?  Staff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.  The menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like \"Snow White Chicken\").  Still with me?  Good...on to the food.  I ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called \"Bo Bo Shrimp\".    The BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no \"sauce\" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.  The Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less \"meat\" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars \"amazing\".  The Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.  I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.  With that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Phoenix for real. You MUST try the egg foo young. It is amazing! If you're vegetarian the family bean curd is also delish. The owners are awesome and we always enjoy our visit!!!!"}
{"text":"FIRST TIME HERE.  The place is in a beat up shopping complex.  Nothing scary- just old.  The inside was lovely for a Chinese restaurant.  Loved the hanging lanterns and the dark red seats and all the gold wood wall hanging which displayed various Chinese dragons.  It felt like a restaurant in china-town (but clean).  Bath rooms probably need a good in the cracks cleaning--- but overall it was clean.  (The kindof clean you want a restaurant bathroom to be in... get my drift?)  Best crab puffs in the area! Yum, you get 8 cream cheese filled pffs for 4.95.  The egg drop soup ($4.00 for a large) was flavorful and really thick--- a little too thick for my preference and full of celery.  My husband raved about it, thought it was the best ever.  We also ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup ($7.25 for a large), would've been knocked out of the park with flavor, ingrediants, however, the cook added too much salt.  Kids ordered a large egg fried rice sans the peas/carrots.  It had a great buttery/bacony flavor to it.  Wow--- so good.  Our entree was the Honey Walnut Shrimp for $11.95.  Shrimp tasted fresh, no funky flavored shrimp.  The sauce was light and when I say \"light\"  it was tossed perfectly.  Shrimp to sauce ratio was spot on.  The shrimp was lightly battered, no tempura shrimp here.  The walnuts came a little light, could've used a little more but it was about 15 large shrimps on the platter.  They priced it right for what you got.  It's your standard American chinese food.   Will definitely be back.  It was good..... if my soup wasn't so salty I probably would've given it 4 stars.  I\"m thinking this was even 3.5 star establishment."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl and nothing ever compares to it. It's a family favorite and always requested by my kids."}
{"text":"We've been going here since i was kid in the early 80's.  a few months ago, i ordered some mong beef for lunch and it was terrible.  i then read an article a few days ago that DPalace received an A+ on their inspection.  So, for nostalgic purposes, i took the fam there for dinner last night.  IT WAS AMAZING.  They definitely redeemed themselves from the last visit.  Dragon Palace is back in my rotation.  the only thing that i wasnt satisfied with is that they changed the recipe of their BoBo Shrimp.  the old recipe was waaay better.  Nonetheless, this a great chinese restaurant and glad to have it in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered take out from this place, it was DELICIOUS! I couldn't of asked for more.  I ordered again last night for the second time (also take out) and I was very disappointed. We were shorted some white rice, the Sesame Chicken was very dry, and the little bit of sauce that was at the bottom had a large layer of drippy oil on top. There was also an egg shell in my Egg Drop Soup. The Special Beef item was just O-K. My boyfriend said he wasn't impressed how the beef was cooked, as it was too chewy. Really thought I found the best Chinese place near me, but apparently this is not the case!"}
{"text":"We've gone here twice and liked it much better the first time compared to last night. Service is odd. Both times the servers were abrupt and it feels like they just throw cups and plates in front of you. Last night they also brought soup and food at once which made us feel rushed.   Our first visit, we tried wor wonton soup, kung pao, and walnut shrimp--it was all pretty good, and flavorful though the kung pao seemed to be only peanuts and chicken. I'd give it 4 stars. Last night we came back for the soup and tried a few appetizers.  Everything was fine, but generally lacked flavor (except the honey chicken wings which were GREAT).  Throw in the service, and we're just not sure we'll come back..."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Chinese food ever. The egg rolls are to die for and the crab puffs are amazing."}
{"text":"I called Dragon Palace one time when I was really hurting for some quality Chinese food. I ordered the house special and something else that way my bill came out to the appropriate delivery amount.   Delivery was a little late, and I'm just 2 maybe 3 blocks away which kinda ticked me off (I was starving!). The dish was absolutely delicious except the chicken was still in huge pieces that I had to cut down.   All in all I liked the food but I think I'll actually go inside next time to experience the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Dragon Place and I have to say from the first visit to the last one i am really underwhelmed with the food. The first time it was really good and flavorful. The second time I was not overly impressed as I was on my first try but this last time I was disappointed in the overall flavor. I ordered the general tso's chicken and egg rolls. The general tso's chicken was mushy and a little over cooked. The egg rolls honestly didn't seem like they had been freshly cooked. I really wanted to like this place because it comes highly recommended and this is just my own experience but I'm pretty sure it won't be my go to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 6 years for take out or eat in.  Mostly I do the Take out, which the food is exceptional!  Food quality is great, and I'm always happy with my meal.  I recommend the Moo Shu Pork or Shrimp.  Pupu Platter Excellent.  On top of that this is a hardworking family owned business and the whole family is really nice and they always remember you and make you feel welcome.     Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese. We end up here about once a week. The owners are very nice. The food is consistent and typically good. We've had a couple off visits, but that's an exception and not the rule."}
{"text":"Menu looks like every single chinese takeout place on the east coast and they aren't pretentious.  Clearly I'm not in California anymore.  Fantastic.  This place made me pretty dang happy.  It's rot gut chinese.  Boom."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were good, food was hot and ready for pick up.  The sweet and sour pork was edible but that's about it. The shrimp egg foo yung blah."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese restaurant I've found in the entire United States. Their cherry sauce cannot be duplicated. They egg rolls are perfection. Their Moo Shu Pork is outstanding. Their chicken dishes always hit the spot.   I've been eating here since I was 10 years old and I'm so glad this place is still in business 23 years later. Looking at it from the outside, you might not expect it to be such a hidden gem. But it is!  Great food the bigger chains and trendy Chinese spots just cannot compete with! I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a throw up emoji to put on here. My boyfriend and I ate here about a month ago; it wasn't amazing but not bad. Tonight my boyfriend ordered the walnut chicken and duck. Oh my gosh please do not put yourself through the pain of eating here. There was a chunky white sauce on the chicken that I swore was chunks of lard. It was so bad my boyfriend tried to put rice and soy sauce all over it to make it edible. I finally gave up after a few bites and ate left overs instead. Sorry dragon palace but I am pretty sure you are going to make me feel very ill in the morning."}
{"text":"I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D   The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.  The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!   My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix I tried several Chinese restaurants and none of them were good. I was beginning to think I wouldn't be able to find a go to place out here. Then, I found Dragon Palace. Don't let the sketchy shopping mall deter you!  Consistently fast, hot, fresh food. You also get huge portion sizes, so you're paying for your lunch or dinner for the next day or two as well.   I've always dined in because not only are they quick, but you get complimentary hot tea and little banana fried wonton things at the end of your meal. Hard to describe but they are so good.   I've never gotten take out before but they must do well with that too as I always see people coming and picking up food while I am there. Service is always prompt. Sure, you aren't getting any small talk from the servers and they are to the point, but I'm not looking for a drawn out meal when I eat at a place like this. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for over 34 years, it's our favorite Chinese.  Love the free tea, and the sizzling rice soup is one of our favorites.  Recently tried another Chinese place in downtown Phoenix and was disappointed and thought that it's about time I give this place the rating that we feel that it deserves.  The meals are large and we always take a box or two home. Lunch prices are a great deal too.  Nice staff - we love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive servers! This place was a fantastic choice for a midweek dinner. Everything we ordered was tasty and fresh! Definitely recommended for all... my 7 year old granddaughter enjoyed her mea, especially the wontons they brought at the end for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a Chinese restaurant close to home that my husband and I can enjoy regularly. A meal out at a Chinese restaurant was a weekly treat for me and my family when I was a kid but I've struggled to find a decent option close to home here in AZ. Dragon Palace is exactly what I'd been looking for.   Love the Mongolian Beef and the Wor Won Ton soup. The House Special Chicken was different than any I'd tasted before, but probably not my favorite version of the dish. The lunch specials are amazing and I'm so happy they offer them on Saturdays. Start off with egg drop soup and crunchy noodles; then the entree of your choice, fried rice, egg roll and won tons plus hot tea. My meal was $6.45 and I was stuffed.   My dislikes: they don't open until noon on Saturdays. I'm an early bird ready for lunch by 11:00 a.m. usually. But worth the wait anyway. They served my husband's meal a good 3 minutes before mine which we felt was weird. The fried rice was only so-so. I like veggies in my fried rice.   All in all, I'm happy I found this place and that is thanks to the reviews of my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese. I myself have pretty specific standards when it comes to Chinese food and Dragon Palace definitely meets those. The chicken wasn't bad or chewy like some places you will find and the egg rolls and crab wontons were amazing. The only thing I would say that could be improved is the flavor of the Kung Pao. It was good but was not very spicy and was a little on the bland side. Other than that this will definitely be a place I will go to again."}
{"text":"House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place based on the reviews.  I am looking for a good Chinese delivery place in Etobicoke.  I ordered spring rolls, Cantonese Chow mein, house fried rice and sweet and sour pork.  The spring rolls are excellent.  The house fried rice as well.  Cantonese Chow Mein was average...noddles were overcooked.  Sweet and sour pork...well the breading wasn't terrific.  I will give it one more chance and update the review if it improves."}
{"text":"Love this place, very clean and good service... first time coming and I totally will came back!!"}
{"text":"Our go-to Chinese restaurant in Phoenix!  Must try the crab puffs, happy family, Mongolian beef, and moo shu."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place hidden in a dive of a strip mall (aren't all  places in strip malls in Phx?). Hey, it allowed me to finally find Joe's Grotto too.  Dragon Palace provides quick, thorough, and friendly service. Very well packaged to-go orders that keep you from having sauce spill out all over your car. I've tried a few dishes and found that they can sometimes be a bit bland, but overall it's quality Chinese food. I happen to be addicted to the Mu Shu Pork. I was surprised they wrap the crepes before packaging, but it really seems to allow the flavors to blend together and they're just plain good.  I had been really disappointed with not being able to find a decent Chinese takeout place in Phoenix and Dragon Palace is just what the doctor ordered!"}
{"text":"Mediocre  !!!! Overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money . I order the house special chicken & sweet & sour chicken with 3 PC egg roll . First disappointment was you can't purchase just one egg roll you have to purchase 3 @ 3.95 then if you want to upgrade to fried rice it's $6 that's crazy !!! So I passed on that I went to go pick up. As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there. I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls , 1 box of house special chicken , 1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice !!!! One box for both entrees we got one small box , I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $27.00 won't be returning."}
{"text":"We literally order Chinese food once a year because, well, you know... it isn't the most healthy opiton out there. BUT!!! My good Lord is it delicious. Enter Dragon Palace. Very friendly staff, amazing food. Don't be deterred by the sketch strip mall - give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food was hot and tasty...only thing was delivery was a little slow, but it was likely cause it was so cold and valentine's Saturday.  FINALLY a yummy Chinese food delivery restaurant in Mississauga! :)"}
{"text":"If you want solid, consistent plentiful Chinese food in a casual atmosphere this is the place for you.  This is our local go to for Orange Chicken and Szechuan Shredded Pork.  We have been going for years.  The restaurant changed hands a few years back and we worried it would go downhill-but not so!  This family run operation still offers the same quality food and the portions are fabulous.  The Orange Chicken is the BEST anywhere-and they use chicken breast.  They do loads of take-out too.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.   The house chicken is great.   Kids love the noodles.   Awesome little diveyy Chinese place with amazing food. It reminds me of the one my mom used to take us to when we were little kids."}
{"text":"Overall, like everyone has been saying so far, huge portions, good quality food, friendly service, and not to mention affordable!  All my friends said I had to try this place before I leave for the States and I'm glad they did! What stopped me before was the long commute from Scarborough to Mississauga, but it was worth it. Drove there during rush hour with 2 buddies for dinner the other night and ordered 3 dishes to share and soup and still had leftovers. Portions were definitely huge, we purposely ordered less cause we wanted dessert after but ended up not finishing everything.  The food was also very tasty and everything was hot and fresh. The crispy beef was real crispy, and the ginger didn't overpower the dish. Chilly chicken had a nice heat to it and it was soooo tender. The fried rice we got was perfect, the rice wasn't sticking with each other and they didn't skimp on the shrimp and pork. We were skeptical of their wonton soup at first so we ordered only one, but ended up ordering 2 more because it was so good! They didn't skimp on the wontons and there was pork in the soup too! The waiter told us that they make their own wontons in house. Everything came out super fast, within 10 mins our table was full of food.  They were also very accommodating. We were craving for Yeung Chow fried rice but it wasn't on the menu, they still made it for us. Best Yeung Chow fried rice I ever had. You can tell the chef knows how to use a wok. Dragon Palace you should definitely put this on the menu!  I'm definitely going to try to hit this spot up one more time before I leave to the States! Hidden gem in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, great staff, very pleasant and welcoming.  Service fast, courteous and accommodating.  Food was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner a few weeks ago after reading the reviews on yelp.  I was pretty disappointed and won't be going back.  I got a cup of the wonton soup as an appetizer - it was pretty pathetic.  The wontons had a dime-sized amount of meat in each one, and the broth was awful.  I got sesame chicken and wasn't impressed with that either.    To top it off, the family that owns the place let their small child run around the entire restaurant and in and out of the kitchen screaming, with the teenaged hostess (also a family member) hardly bothering to try to quiet her down.  The waitress just went and sat at a table next to the kitchen staring at me the whole time.  What the heck?  Atmosphere gets a zero."}
{"text":"I have had highs and lows with this place. I think they are the best deal if you go for lunch. the honey walnut shrimp is my favorite their soup is delicious I preferred dining in to take out though I think it's a better deal."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Orange chicken is a must have, they use real orange peels in their sauce."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite. They feed you like your starving. Staff was on point with what you expect from a chinese restaurant. Food just as good, chicken was a bit dry but spot on for flavor. Mongolian Beef was perfect.  We did the peking family meal. And the Zombie drinks were great. Planning to make this our goto for chinese food. With tip whole meal came to $60ish for 2. Now onto home for a food coma."}
{"text":"So glad this new restaurant opened in Sharpsburg! Got take-out during their first week in business and it was the best I've had in the Pittsburgh area, even though I've been to a couple of pretty good Chinese restaurants in other parts of greater Pittsburgh. The hot and sour soup was spicy and flavorful (I always judge a Chinese restaurant by their hot-and-sour since everybody makes it), and my Chicken with Eggplant had just the right amount of spice/ sweetness. Generous portions, good service. I will definitely be returning, and I hope they are able to maintain this level of quality!"}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience at a restaurant ever!! Not only did my mother and I get an attitude from all the employees the moment we sat down but we were being rushed thru our dinner. We ordered the Peking dinner for two with a side of assorted veggies and all of our food was brought at pretty much at the same time. Pu pu platter was brought out then immediately the soup was brought out. I had time to eat one item off my pu pu platter when the veggies followed immediately by the house special chicken were brought out. After asking why we were being rushed the owner said \"no rush\" and took the chicken and veggies back. After having a chance to catch up to the food on the table, the platter and the soup, they brought out the chicken and veggies. Which were barely room temp but then again it was pretty cold inside there so I will say ice cold. They asked us what we wanted to do and we told them leave because they had ruined our Christmas Eve dinner which had been a tradition of going out for Chinese since my Grandparents were alive and I was a young kid. After completely ruining our dinner they demanded us to pay for the pu pu platter and soup. We paid for it all the while listening to every excuse as to why we were getting an attitude and being rushed thru our meal. I have been going to this restaurant 25+ yrs and have never had this kind of service. I will never step foot in this place ever again!! They actually deserve no star at all!!"}
