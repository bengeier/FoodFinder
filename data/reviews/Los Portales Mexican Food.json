{"text":"This is strictly a Spanish speaking restaurant. 
It is not like the service we received was less but our waitress did not understand a word of English and the only people there were speaking very loudly about bar room brawls and \"pulling guns\" on guys who were hitting on their \"girls\". I in no way think this is reflective of the owners or staff but I bring it up so yelpers can decide for themselves if it is a family friendly location. I would not want to take kids there. The potions were good, but the quality was average. I did not dislike this place but would try to find a better restaurant next time. The neighborhood seemed fine but I was frightened by the activity in the parking lot."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a 0 stars I would! I had been there before & even though I almost $100 for 2 tostadas especiales, 2 sodas & 2 kids plates we had to go back for the tostada especial it was delicious! But the day we went was valentines day, we had a party of almost 30 people & other than the kids we all wanted the tostada, well they weren't serving the tostada that day so we tried to leave but they weren't gonna let that happen & told us they were making the tostadas for us. After we placed the order had some chips & salsa(nasty salsa btw) & had our drinks served the cashier came & told us they had no product & they couldn't make the tostadas?? Even though we were really mad We ended up staying had a horrible waitress only one for the whole party she was slow bringing wrong drinks & then wrong food when we went to pay they were over charging some of the meals by at least $3, we noticed we weren't the only ones there was a whole bunch of people trying to get their checks fixed by the cashier(btw she did give us a 15% discount which ended up going towards the tip they charged us cause with that service i wasn't gonna tip them at all) will not go back to that place horrible experience did i mention that we were there for 5 hours?? Yes 5!!"}
{"text":"My favorite mariscos restaurant this side of the border. Love their carne asada de carbon tambien, the best. Great spot on the west side. A must try."}
{"text":"We should have had a clue when we pulled up and were the only car in the parking lot and the only table seated in the building.  We still went ahead and gave it a chance. I ordered the Chiles Rellenos from the menu, it was pretty meh, I have had better.  The smell in the place had that smell of a dirty gasoline station bathroom.  for $14 for a plate of chile rellenos that weren't that great and a bottle of water I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place blows my brains!! Authentic Mexican Food + Live Music = 5 stars."}
{"text":"Whoa!  DO NOT ENTER THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  Whoa!

At the end of the day I don't know if it was racism, language difficulties, if they hated just me, or they were just trying to clip me but my one-and-only visit to this dump was like a visit to a border town. 

Dishonest, disingenuous, disappointing. disgusting. 

It was 8:17 PM and, of course, Garcia's was already closed waaaaaay ahead of their web-and-store- posted 9 o'clock closing time, so I thought why not try Los Portales?  It's right there, right up the street...give it a shot!

I walked in and glanced at the menu  a young lady asked me what I would like. I told her that I was interested in a combo platter: burrito, relleño, taco rice and beans and she said $7.99. \"Sure\", I said. 

Then we went to beer. \"$4 for a Corona\" she said then she brought out one of those little baby 7 oz Corona's. Are you kidding me? In my neighborhood alone, I've got at least 3 restaurants that serve SIX 7 oz Corona's for $9.99!  I started to sense that there was gonna be a problem or two. I ordered a regular sized Corona for $5. 

The food came: no rice, no beans, no chile relleño. She was made to understand to retrieve those items; the relleño never appeared. 

Now, when, precisely, in American food history did \"carne asada\" come to mean,  \"burned beef\" because somewhere along the way that's what Carne Asada has come to be, MOST ESPECIALLY AT LOS PORTALES!!!!  Horrible, dry, very salty beef with some pepper. Ugh. 

Then I ordered guacamole and it was mediocre. Overall, the food is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!

Then the bill came, which should have been $5 for the beer, $5 for the guacamole and $7.95 for the food...I'm not that good at math but I'd calculate that to be about $18. The bill was for $27.95. 

I told her to make the correction or get me the manager but if there wasn't a resolution at $17.95, I was calling the cops before they did/could. The manager, begrudgingly, never got out of his chair, did make the correction.  This is The part where I call the manager and the restaurant names but Yelp won't like it so I'll just leave it at that. 

YOU GO TO LOS PORTALES. I'VE BEEN. QUITE UNSUCCESSFULLY. Thankful I got out with my life."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I just finished my $24.09 shrimp quesadilla with beans and rice and drink and it was incredibly disappointing! After a recommendation from a good friend we decide to do a late night dinner. We were greeted by an officer of the Phoenix police department before we even got to the front door. Worrisome?! Once we walk through the doors my eardrums were assaulted with extremely loud music. I'm all for setting a mood but the restaurant was packed with all but 3 tables and us. Not the best group of 7 dinner date atmosphere. We had to scream over the \"tunes\". After waiting for what felt like 20 minutes for our waitress to come over we finally placed our order. I knew the shrimp quesadilla cost $12.99 and the drink was $1.99. High but willing to pay after the waitress said it was a decent plate serving. I also added rice and beans. The meal came out quickly but my white rice was adorned with wrinkly peas and one random Lima bean... Odd. The quesadilla was soggy and there was hardly any shrimp in it. We continually asked for the music to be turned down and we kindly ignored. RUDE! Right before the check came they decided it was a good idea to have a full mariachi band play to all but 9 people. So loud I thought my ears were bleeding. Then the bills come out. We asked to pay separate. No big deal. Then she proceeded to hand out our bills. I looked at the price and nearly fell off my chair. She had added the total of everyone's meals and put a 10% gratuity on it! Not cool!!!! Then I see a charge for $4 for a drink. I asked the waitress what the charge was and she proceeded to tell me that after 9pm the drinks are no longer $1.99. Everyone got water at that same price as well. Never heard of a $4 glass of water. She never mentioned this, nor did it say anything about that on their menu... Pretty petty if you ask me. Now it totally makes sense why there was no one in this place on a Friday night! I'm so disappointed and feel like I have been taken advantage of. I'm a good tipper and usually look past \"petty\" stuff but this was the worst dining experience I've had. Ever!"}
{"text":"I don't go to restaurants or bars often but when I do, Los Portales is my first pick! I've been coming here everyday for 2 years and will continue to come here for many more years! Love the food and the service!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going there and we can say that the sea food was really good, and prices were fair! Most definitely will be going there again when wanting tasty sea food!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, I do not know how I ended up here. The server had no knowledge about the drinks, and all those girls seemed really rude. When my mom payed the bill, they had the nerve to ask if we were going to tip her which obviously we were, but I find it very unprofessional for them to be asking people to tip them."}
{"text":"Los Portales Is the Best Mexican Seafood Restaurant in the Valley. The Environment at Night isnt kid friendly, So I wouldn't recommend it for people trying to have a sit down quiet dinner with their kids. This is a place with a party atmosphere and with Great Fresh Seafood expect to pay a little more, if you're looking for a chain restaurant or a cheap meal, then you're better off going there. Go To Portales for the Seafood, Live Music, Bottle Service on the Weekends, and dancing with your significant other. Overall great place to have a good time with great food."}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I took a gamble on Los Portales and the odds were not in our favor from the beginning. 

Save your money and appetite and kindly write this off as a place to try for lunch.

Before we entered the building, we should have known it would be a bad experience. The place is empty at noon. We were the only guests there the entire lunch hour. When you come in you are greeted by a waitress and what smells like a urinal cake. It's not very strong, but I can only guess it is from the products used to clean. Which is on the plus side, I suppose.

What is with the windows? Why are they spray painted? It's eerie. Spend a few $100 and get them tinted. 

The food is meh and overpriced. There is no lunch menu options and it is so dark inside the building that it takes some time to read the menu. Does this say tostada or taco? I dunno! Just make your best guess. 
Oh, and once you figure out what you do want to order, it may not be available. For example, a fish tostada... nope sorry we don't have that. May I have onions on my tostada? Oh, no. Sorry, we don't have onions either. May I have sour cream on my dish? Uhh... let me check. 

Aside from all of that, you have to pay with a debit card for your meal. Then the waitress is looking at you and asks, \"How much is Tip?\" It's just an awkward experience. 

If I could use the thumbs down emoji I would. I wish I could write my meal off as a taxable donation, because I certainly wasn't satisfied Los Portales. My wallet and stomach are disappointed."}
{"text":"Basically best Mexican seafood food in phoenix I ever had ,very good service.good music .definitely I recommend everyone go there."}
