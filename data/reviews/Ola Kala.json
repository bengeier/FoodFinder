{"text":"Great food and friendly service 
Excellent neighbourhood resto, really worth the visit."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. I had very low expectations because it is in a bad location (attached to a dep) but whatever. 

We ordered fried calamari and tyganopsimo (fried bread) and tzatazki to start. Everything was good. The tyganopsimo was sooo damn good! The best I ever had prior to Ola Kala was at Phillinos on Park Avenue, this one blew it out of the water. (It's sweeter, thicker, crunchy and chewy!)

Greek salad was pretty standard and by the time I finished eating fried bread I didn't feel like eating anything else. Husband said the pork souvlaki he ordered was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Ola Kala feels more of sports bar than a conventional Greek restaurant.... and that's a good thing! This is indeed true when you enjoy restaurant quality food at a place you can hang out with friends and watch some sports.

I visited with a group of friends and we shared a bunch of plates and here is my personal opinion on them :

Saganaki : The fried cheese was good but.... not great. I found it to be quite salty. Portion size was only OK. (3 stars)

Calamari : A little crispy but mostly chewy. They were quite good. Portion size is generous. (4 stars)

Greek Salad : Traditionally made with fresh ingredients. I quite enjoyed this plate. Portion size is decent. (4 stars)

Greek Potatoes : These potatoes tasted really great! For their cost, portion size is generous. (5 stars)

Donner Pita : They do their donner pitas right, very good! Would have again. (5 stars)

Loukaniko : Surprisingly excellent! Huge sausage, so much so you have to share! (5 stars)

The service was very friendly and the food was served quickly.

Very positive experience, price-tag is reasonable. Parking is very limited."}
{"text":"I was invite to a bday party at this new resto. The food was your typical excellent Greek food but the look was more of a sports bar. I found that to be different. On this night we were blessed with all kinds of food. The saganaki was excellent. I can still taste the Greek meatballs with their unique taste. The pikilia had a good variety of sauces and the meats to die for. 
They had a full bar and my fave 12 star metaxa! 
Since we did not pay not sure about the price but was told very reasonable. I will be back."}
