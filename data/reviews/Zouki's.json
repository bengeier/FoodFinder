{"text":"Best Shish Taouk in montreal, Make sure to get the Village Bread instead of the regular pita, a little more expensive but worth it"}
{"text":"These types of places just make me angry.  I want to give the underdog a try but it's no wonder the reviews are horrible.    Tiny wrap.  Dry.  Expensive. Nothing good to say.  I'm surprised this place is in business because it's really THAT bad."}
{"text":"I should have known better. In my search for great falafel restaurants in the greater Montreal area, I have found only one great one on the West Island. The problem is always that the falafel are not hot out of the fryer but are left to sit in a warming tray an are luke warm or even cold by the time they get to your plate.  This place was no different. Better than average, salads, hummus and sauces. BUT the falafel was cold!  Too bad. Carrefour Laval has a great food court. It's so nice to eat on regular plates with silverware and glassware instead of paper and plastic. Unfortunately this particular establishment is overlooking their quality control. What a shame!"}
{"text":"If you want to receive terrible service, go here. Food isn't anything to write home about but the service was unreal! They acted like we didn't exist. For Lebanese food, go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"After a nice afternoon shopping next door at Costco, my friend and I stopped by Zouki's. We were not disappointed. This \"what you see is what you get\" establishment is exactly what you'd expect if what you expect is a shish taouk sandwich and lasting garlic breath.  Clean, fresh, friendly staff, not mind blowing but up to par.  4 stars (rounded up by hunger factor)"}
{"text":"Had the falafel - make sure you specify the size otherwise the upsell you the bigger 'Villa' one. Sadly the food looked tired: tomatoes looked melted and old, the hummus was getting crusty til the guy mixed it back up....too bad because the Lebanese crepe they serve it on was very good. Not fresh... At least not at 4:30 in the afternoon"}
{"text":"Food was OK but the service sucks, hands down, the guy serving was just barking questions at us and repeating them like 3 times during the 2 seconds we took to make up our minds, had to tell him to shut up for one second while we ordered, very rude person who shouldn't have a business or human interaction at all."}
{"text":"Zouki's is a Lebanese themed court food joint that one can order a some quick grub, take a break and get back to shopping within the Carrefour Laval shopping center. As an avid lover of Lebanese food, I couldn't resist trying this place out.  So, what exactly is Zouki? It's this crepe-like bread that you use instead of Pita. I opted to try it out though for those who don't Pita is available. I couldn't resist ordering the Felafel. Sadly, it was very underwhelming with a mere 2 balls of Felafel that fell flat. I don;t know what it was but the whole thing was very underwhelming. Was it fresh? Was it well made? This is not the Felafel I tend to eat from multiple locations that I can order it from. The Felafel needs to be better or simply not offer it at all. The Zouki experience was bland. Perhaps I like the Pita more.  I opted for the Garlic potatoes and a V8 juice to compliment my trio. All in all, it cost me about $12, around the same price one would expect from such places. The garlic potatoes were good.  Would I come back? Maybe for the shish taouk pita. We'll see. However, many other options in this food court are available."}
{"text":"Good food for a food court, i took a chicken sandwich with a lebanese (crepe like) bread so delicious. They had the option of a regular pita but this is much better. The tabouleh salad was just ok as with most fast food places. I  am usually reluctant  about food court food but would definitely come back for the same sandwich maybe to try the meat version instead. 4 star for the sandwich i tried. 2 stars for the tabouleh and food court. 3 stars overall."}
