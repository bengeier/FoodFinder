{"text":"Great authentic Pakistani food. Food is good, reasonably priced and the taste is excellent. The food is spiced one way, the original way. If you want something mild, better stick with the tandoori chicken and ask for it mild or  a chicken roll, do not ask for medium, as medium means something completely different to this cuisine. Wonderful halim and nahari, (it is spicy and hot and no it does not come mild). If you want sudo Indian/Pakistani food try some other place, but if you want something really good then this is the place. This is a popular joint, Saturdays evenings are crowded, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food. Great People. Affordable price.   I loveeeee their butter chicken and their kabob rolls."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Indian resto , I've been coming to location for over 5 years . The looks Are showing its age but the food is great , if not probably the best Indian food in Montreal. Every single dish I've had has been always screaming the words flavour and delicious.  The owners are very welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a great meal ."}
{"text":"Went 3 times as dine in Veg Briani is good Lentil soup as well Not impressed with curry shrimp for take out as shrimps was hard and chewy .. Also service can be slow and when you ask for a doggy bag they don't pack ur food . They just give you a box to do it yourself.."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I went there with my sister and we orders the chichen roll as entree and the vegetable samosas. The yogurt sauce and the other sweet one were delicious. I'm usually not a fan of sauce but the flavours were bursting. I ordered the chicken jalfrezi and my sister took the lamb balti ... Two succulent mild dishes. Their naan was good too."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, unfriendly rude people. If they make a mistake they never apologize. I don't suggest anyone to go there. I would rather go somewhere where people are kind to you. Seriously bad energy there."}
{"text":"Below is my initial review. The food was so good, I went back again and had the same thing. Same result: great food, somewhat unfriendly service. Someone should teach these people that it costs nothing to smile. As before: Food: 5 stars.  Service and environment: 1 star.  Averaged to a result of 3. --------------------- Shahi Palace. That's a misnomer as the place is small and dingy.  The summary:  Food: 5 stars.  Service and environment: 1 star.  Averaged to a result of 3.  I walked in and a worker there ignored me. I had to ask to be shown where to sit.  Thoroughly unfriendly service. The waitress scowled at me and avoided eye contact, as though I was an inconvenient annoyance to her.  I ordered mutton tikka. About 5 minutes later an older man (owner, I think) approached me with the menu. I told him I'd already ordered. At least he smiled - sort of. Anyway, not a scowl.  Then the food came and my stomach did a happy dance. Great mutton tikka, perfectly grilled, slightly spicy (just a hint), a reasonable salad, and an enormous piece of delicious naan bread.  They're lucky I tipped on the food, and not on their unfriendly service. If go there again it will be because the food was great.  If you go, only go for the food. The service will not please you."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted on giving this a 3 vs 4 star rating. I have been going to Shahi Palace for easily the last 15 years. The food is always on point and delicious, I highly recommend the butter chicken and chicken roll, as well as seekh kabab. The service and decor on the other hand, is a different story. The interior of the restaurant is in bad need of a facelift, I don't believe they have touched it since they reopened after a fire maybe 10 years ago, even a fresh coat of paint would do a world of difference! Then there is the problem of service, or lack of. Even though this restaurant is small, you will see the staff (owner) 3 times, once to take your order, another time to deliver your order and lastly to clear the table, try to flag them down and you get an exasperated sigh for going over your quota of 3 interactions. I went with 4 stars in the end because I enjoy the food that much, but do yourself a favor, call in advance to place your order and get it to go."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this restaurant for about 14 years now. It is our go to place when we decide to have a a family outing for lunch and dinner. The sizzling chicken and biryani are my favorite dishes off the menu. The chicken pakoras, allo gobi and seekh kebabs are also very good. Pretty much everything is good. Service has always been great throughout the years."}
{"text":"Review is only based on the chicken rolls which I found were very bland and tasteless. Was getting some to go and one of my friends wanted to eat one while sitting there waiting and they wanted to charge $5 for him to be able to eat it inside. That is very poor customer service. Will try again because I've heard from the inlaws that the food is good but Lahori Karhai has much better chicken rolls."}
{"text":"This place is high on my list whenever I'm in Montreal.  The food is incredibly tasty (Chicken Tikka, Palak's of various kinds, curries).  The portions are not huge, which is a plus to me: I'd rather have quality than quantity and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  Thanks to whoever posted the menu in yelp; incredibly useful as it seems to be the only web-accessible menu."}
{"text":"This is by far, one of the best Indian / Pakistani food I've ever had. Being an Indian myself, I had the opportunity of eating fine Indian food in Mumbai, NYC, Toronto, Tampa, Los Angeles, etc. When only speaking about the food, it is definitely excellent. The grilled pieces of chicken breast are succulent yet savoury in its thick orange sweet and spicy sauce. The chicken biryani definitely has some heat to it, but when paired with the mint chutney on top of the rice and chicken, it brings back memories of Mumbai's famous biryani at Delhi Darbar (which is a Mumbai famous restaurant since the early 1900s).   To be honest and transparent, the restaurant does need a makeover and the service needs improvement. However, I have built a great relationship with the owner where I am served great food each and every time. I barely do eat at the restaurant so I mostly order my food to go. Though there are some hits and misses, on the days they are hits, they really hit the spot well.   I am impressed with the culinary style of the father who started this restaurant back in the 1980s considering when he is still in the kitchen and the cook, he is a great master chef. On days when he isn't the cook, there could be a possibility of encountering a \"miss\". As long as Shahi continues to have the main owner as the main cook, this restaurant will continue to thrive in its Indian / Pakistani offerings.   Constructive feedback:   - Renovate the restaurant and offer a great customer service.  - Expand the restaurant towards the Downtown, Montreal proximity to cater towards a larger population and demographic than West Island.  - Super enhance the marketing.   If these 3 things can be done while only keeping the customer in mind, they will have a high possibility of expanding quickly nationwide.   Thank you to the Shahi Palace family for great memories of their food!"}
{"text":"Don't judge this place by its cover. You have plenty of high end Indian restaurants in Montreal with fancy decors but this is where you will get the taste of India. The food is rich in perfect blend of Indian spices and tastes delicious. You can ask them to make it more or less spicy to accommodate your taste palate.   A good friend of mine told me to try out their famed \"Chola Bhatura\", a dish comprising of spicy chick peas and it was finger licking good. Plus, it is not pricey. I should have tried their Lassi though. Well, I will leave that for the next time since I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"My family and I grew up eating Shahi take-out. The folks at Shahi knows us well, my sisters are obsessed with Indian cuisine. Shahi has never disappointed our curry cravings. We rarely eat at the resto but they have a dozen tables, service is good most importantly food is yummy."}
{"text":"Shahi Palace is entirely devoid of atmosphere. Most patrons seem to prefer to eat in their cars, or at home. We chose the dine-in option, and are no worse for the wear (though I am still puzzling over the locker room aesthetic of the bathroom).  I was most impressed with the naan and the salt lassi. The salt lassi is full of cumin seeds, by the way. It was not as salty as one I had in New Jersey, but that's OK. The naan was nicely charred without being burnt to a crisp. If only I could achieve the same result in my home toaster. The raita was pretty good, too; nice and sour.  I liked our entrees. The chicken jalfrazi was certainly spicy (not hot), but a little too much oil. There was also a paneer that worked well.  Really, at $28 for this stuff, it's hard to go too wrong. Apparently, though, I might have tried a chicken roll. Those were selling fast."}
{"text":"I have been here 4-5 times now. Food is always great veg or non veg. Service is quick, when it is not that busy. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. This is good for luncheons. Portion size is also very good."}
{"text":"Best Indian/Pakistani food ever. They will make almost anything mild or medium, but medium should be called hot. The spices is rich and flavorful. The food always comes out hot and fresh. The naan is still warm when you get it."}
{"text":"The chicken rolls are killer. Everything is good here."}
