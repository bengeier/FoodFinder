{"text":"Suncup just opened and we're really excited to have them in the neighborhood! They're just ramping up and working out a few minor kinks in service, but the service is terrific and smiles on every face. It's very welcoming with a simple but comfortable environment. They have a nice menu of sweet and savory croissants and \"croissant pies\". We tried the chocolate croissant and the spinach-feta croissant pie - both were excellent, though the chocolate croissant was the standout. Looking forward to going back and trying their other dishes. The German chocolate cake looks really tantalizing!"}
{"text":"The bagels are hard and stale. The coffee is OK. Overall the prices are too high for the quality of the product.  The inside is cold and makes Starbucks feel warm and homey. Maybe they should change the name to Emo cafe.....its depressing."}
{"text":"The wife and I tried Suncup out the other day. We ordered a latte, cinnamon hot tea and a plain croissant. We got the drinks in average time. I liked the tea and my wife said the latte was okay. The trouble comes with the croissant. About 5 minutes after our drinks came I went up to check on the croissant and turns out they forgot about it.They apologized and brought one out not to long after. We started eating it and the outside was nice and warm but the inside was ice cold. We finished our drinks and split. The reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not lower is because I understand there are kinks to work in opening a new spot.   I did enjoy the tea and the atmosphere was nice. Probably will be a long while before we try them out again though."}
{"text":"Epic breakfasts and amazing pastries. Great service and nice patio for breakfast or a coffee!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, being a new independent cafe within walking distance, but was disappointed. The coffee was as expensive as Starbucks, with less flavor. It looked like they had some yummy pastries, but I just wanted a cuppa with a friend. Service was really slow, even though there were hardly any customers there.  I hope they've improved, because I root for our local , independent restaurants."}
{"text":"Good coffee selection. I had their chai tea which was delicious. This about the same price range as Starbucks. The inside is large so their always room to sit. Nice renovation."}
{"text":"Delicious croissants. Nice atmosphere.  Much better and less expensive than Early Baker"}
{"text":"This coffee is the best coffee I have had here in Phoenix.  I love the atmosphere and they are bringing a good vibe to this area.  They are building community as well, and welcome all ages to sit, relax, get some work done and enjoy.  I wish them the best, and thank Suncup for opening this positive place in our community."}
{"text":"Recently, Suncup Cafe revised their food offerings to include breakfast sandwiches, wraps, etc. This was much needed as previously the options were limited. They don't have a kitchen so don't expect more than what can be made with their stylish bright red convection oven. The interior has a mix of chairs and leather couches along with various art for sale. The always have good jams playing to accompany conversations with friends with a delicious cup of Joe. I'm not sure what brand of coffee they serve up, but I do like it even more so than many of their rivals. Relax on the large patio under misting fans and catch a view of the mountains. And, don't forget two punch Tuesdays. Why the four stars? Some of the baristas aren't as jovial as I like. Other than that it's a great place to sit and chill or grab and go."}
{"text":"I am super excited for this place and anxious to see it develop in the foothills area as there aren't any coffee places directly in the foothills. I am an avid coffee and tea drinker and love local spots over chains. I have had their hot chai tea latte and it was good. It wasn't the best I have ever had but would order it again. I love cold brew coffee so I was excited seeing their taps for it, however, it was disgusting and I will not order it again. I tried to like it but ended up throwing it away after two sips and adding sweetner at home. It didn't even taste like cold brew. This place has potential and their service is good. Was hoping they served breakfast and not just croissant stuff but beggers can't be choosers. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot to hand out and relax. It's like the opposite of Dutch Bros (less kids running around) and a nicer view. Ahwatukee needs places like this, and I am glad to see that Suncup is here.  If you are looking for a place to hang out and read or get some work done this place is great. Especially if you are one of those lunatics at the Starbucks inside Frys/Safeway with a laptop attempting work."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Very limited menu since they said they don't have a kitchen.  Muffins were served cold.  Looked like they came from Costco."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really love it. The coffee is excellent and the chocolate croissant is probably the best I've had around Ahwatukee. The staff and the owner are very friendly and greeted me each time I've walked in. If you want really good coffee go here!"}
{"text":"There are few options for coffee hangouts in the Ahwatukee Foothills, so needless to say, I was very excited to find out that Suncup Cafe was opening a shop just up the street from me.  The cafe is spacious and welcoming, the staff is friendly, and the cappuccino is good.  One major plus for me is they serve their drinks in actual coffee cups, not just paper take away containers.  This is a rare treat in Arizona suburbs.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best coffee I have found in Ahwatukee. The interior is very nicely designed and comfortable. I got a croissant as well and it was ok but could use a little work. The service was also great. A very friendly staff.  The coffee is very much worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting atmosphere, friendly staff and great drinks! Suncup cafe is exactly the coffee shop that Ahwatukee needs."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is something we definitely needed in this area. A local coffee shop! If you don't want to have the standard Starbucks, stop by this place. Excellent coffee (PieXoto), nice atmosphere.  Excellent addiction to the Foothills area!"}
{"text":"Great local place! I like the relaxed vibe. We didn't get food this time but the food looks really yummy. I got a chai and it was so good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Positive reviews for this plce must be from relatives and close friends. The coffee is weak and tasteless. None of the bake goods are made at the location, instead coming from a bakery mill. Unless you like a poor cup of coffee sipped in peace and quiet  (place is always empty), go eslewhere. To boot, very pricey."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 6$ breakfast sandwich, they don't offer an option without meat. So no egg and cheese option, I mean, who doesn't offer a simple sandwich? So I ask to take bacon off. Then it's ice cold in the middle. 6$. Tasted equivalent if not lesser than to their neighbor McDonald's.  Coffee was not good either and the chai tasted exactly like the Dunkin' Donuts mix.  I assume I'm walking into a high end cafe (based on prices) then the product is sub par.  Coming from New England lots of coffee cafes to compare to and unfortunately this place doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"What a shame.   Went in expecting a cafe - it's not.  Weak weak \"food\" selection.  Average coffee.  Lots of room to hang out thou.   Hate to dis local places but man..."}
{"text":"We went there this morning for breakfast. Friendly staff, clean new place, inviting couches with the daily newspaper.  There was no other customers. We placed our order at the counter. 1 coffee, 1 cappuccino, 1 plain croissant, 1 ham/cheese croissant.  Cashier shouted our order once ready to pick up. Capuccino spilled, there was too much milk l guess.  We doubled checked if the order was correct because it didn't look like a ham cheese croissant. Cashier confirmed indeed it was.  And it was, just burnt to black (Carbonaro effect). Croissant was nice and flaky, the inside was nasty. Ham was dehydrated and cheese was stuck to it like cardboard. We will NOT return.  Plain croissant $3.5, stuffed $5.  We tried Suncup cafe and we are not impressed.  We were hoping for a much nicer food experience based on past reviews.  Why did  they sell us a cremated ham with a smile?"}
{"text":"This coffee house is legit amazing. I love it here, the staff is wonderful and the Piexoto coffee is worth every last drop. Great place to relax before or after work. They have so many gluten free options and all of them know their stuff when it comes to coffee! I go almost daily to suncup and every morning I'm greeted by smiling faces and great conversation. Sorry starbucks but there's no comparison!"}
{"text":"Great  atmosphere and excellent service, we were super excited that a nice and clean place open where one can have  coffee and bagel other stuff, croissant was very fresh and they heated up for and coffee taste great this place just open up and we think as they grow so will the  menu, most important thing for my wife and kids was then staff was very friendly and cafe is spotless and we ill come and again for sure  thanks again"}
{"text":"We really love this place. My daughter and I frequent it on our way to drop her off at school sometimes and it is always such a great pick me up early in the mornings. The coffee is delicious and I know that at least some of their food is locally sourced (the manager told us from where, but I don't recall). The vibe of this place is really relaxed and you see people working on their laptops and others just sitting and chatting. Their patio is dog friendly and has a beautiful view. We love supporting local business and we really enjoy the super friendly staff that always makes you feel special!"}
