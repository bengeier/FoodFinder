{"text":"Great restaurant. Went here last night for the first time and was pretty happy with everything. The build your own burger concept was great and at little cost. You essentially just pay for the meat and any special toppings in which everything else comes free. I chose to have zucchini fries with my burger (+$1) which was well worth it. My significant other wanted an appetizer which was pretty basic. I would skip the apps here. Not much of a beer selection either if thats what your looking for.  All in all very delicious burgers and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and was unusually slow for the location. Saw a dead cockroach in the bathroom and figured out why. Can't determine where the fowl smell is coming from but the aroma of the burger overpowered my urge to vomit in my lipstick stained glass. If that coffee was Seattle's Best I'd hate to taste their worst...wanted to sit outside but between the heat and the oxidizing white chairs, I sat inside at a booth I could watch TV In. Lots of high quality TV's but they need to get the sports package..."}
{"text":"Great food everytime. The ingredients are fresh and every wait person is super friendly and helpful. Amber is great!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to write a review, but I have been to Blu Burger about 6 times and I am continuously impressed with not only the food, but the amazingly consistent and outstanding service!  I love their beer selection, burgers and happy hour menu! I usually go there with my 3 kids and as a server myself, I sometimes cringe when I see a bunch of kids come in, but the staff at Blu is always friendly and extra attentive!  This is by far my favorite place to take the family or grab a beer with my friends!  Well done Blu Burger.... keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went there last night for the first time and we weren't very impressed. The service was fast &friendly, We ordered the buffalo potato chips with the blue cheese dressing and they were pretty good. I ordered the blu burger and o found it very dry and the caramelized onions over powered everything else in the burger. My boyfriend ordered the southwest burger which was drenched in  the chipotle \"mayo\" . Overall we would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because it is called blu burger not blu chicken. I must say that I have been here 3 times and haven't had anything bad but prefer the chicken sandwiches to the burgers. Although there is a large selection of toppings, I am rating the quality of the burger itself. The burger is nothing specials but the array of toppings make it pretty good. I enjoy the fact that they are pet friendly because I might stop in after the doggie wash or some other outing that includes my fur baby. I personally prefer a few other places for burgers. A chicken sandwich with gorgonzola, bacon, caramelized onion and anyone of their delicious mayos is a great meal and large enough for me to eat twice!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Salmon is amazing here and I love love love their salads. Great service from Desiree and it's a perfect lunch spot. Love sitting outside when the weather is good. Prices have gone up though as of late so I don't know if we will be frequenting as much as we used to."}
{"text":"Great Amercian Burger! Amazing service! Brilliant interior! The burger was delicious but it was a little big. It's a great restraunt good for any occasion."}
{"text":"I walked over to this place after the gal in Olive Gourmet recommended it. I am very happy that i did.   I came in during lunch and there was no wait. It had a nice, relaxed atmosphere.   The waitress (I think her name is Desiree or Denise) was wonderful! She had an awesome sense of humor and was fast, courteous, and genuine. She also had killer food recommendations, and i was so happy i went with them.   I got the green chile burger. It actually had a good flavor and a nice kick. For a side, I got the sweet potato fries. They were crisp, salted, and delicious.   I would definitely come back here again! I just wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"Came to this place a while back and, while the food was pleasant, I cannot say that there was anything to set this place apart from the other restaurants in the area. The food was good, but slightly overpriced given that you are essentially buying a burger and fries. The staff is generally good at service, but overhearing employees talk about their personal life (especially where the management joins the conversation) usually makes for an awkward time. This is a place for people looking for a new experience; otherwise, I would recommend one of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday afternoon. There were about four other people there. However I think we just got there before the rush because at least 3 other groups of people showed up after us. I had the habanero burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had the flavor of habanero but lacked the heat, which I liked. The sweet potato fries were well done. I ordered the burger Medium well and it was cooked to perfection.The staff was very friendly and service was fast. The only thing I can say bad about it is they only had one table for six people. So I guess if you want to go here, bring only 5 people. When it's all said and done, I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Well, my brother came back early from NYC and came over so we decided to go out to eat and we have been wanting to try Blu Burger for a while now.  It is a higher end burger place but casual.  They are a Build Your Own Burger restaurant.  My wife got the Angus Burger, my brother got the Turkey burger and I got the Chicken breast.  We all added the toppings we liked and all gave it 4 stars.  On mine, I got BBQ sauce, jalapeno, habanero sauce, and gorgonzola  cheese on a whole wheat bun with sweet potato fries.  The presentation was very good and the food was delicious.  My wife likes her burgers medium rare, and a lot of restaurants wont do this any more so she was happy they would.  She said it was cooked right and was very juicy.  Service was good and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is super friendly and the owner always makes it a priority to come over to the tables to make sure everything is good. My personal favorite here is the Blu Chicken or the Turkey burger. Both really good ....oh and you have to get the zucchini fries as a side they are the best. I also like the fact that you have the option to build your own burger, then you get everything you want and nothing you don't. Also the location is a plus the movie theater being right across the street is great, always nice to get great service, delish food and get to catch a movie after. I would recommend this place to anyone and do actually recommend it to my friends. :)   Thank You, Jaime"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Tru Burger. Ivry our server was very nice and explained menu items well. Great personality. The California Burger was amazing. We tried the Green Bean Fries w/wasabi ranch. They were great. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were underwhelmed by both the atmosphere and the food. I ordered a build your own burger. While the patty itself was cooked as I like it and it was tasty, they skimped on the cheese and though the bun looked toasted, it was COLD!  I took two bites and then proceeded to just eat the fries. My meal wasn't bad...but it wasn't good. I then understood why the place was barely half full on a Friday night while the place directly across the street was jam packed with a 40 minute wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger on an impulse and got the BBQ burger. It was absolutely amazing. I haven't been impressed with a meal in a long time. It also helped having such friendly service from my server Brandi. I will return many times."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Blu Burger and the buffalo chips. Friendly staff and attentive. I look forward to my next trip"}
{"text":"Amber our server was great! Our first time here so she gave us a run down of how the place worked along with some excellent suggestions. Killer happy hour. Big portions for happy hour apps starting at $3 and $2 beers.  You can't go wrong. Great burgers too."}
{"text":"UPDATE.....I rated Blu Burger a while back and said that I did not see a colored tint to my burger which is true but I went back a few days ago and we sat in a different spot and my whole burger patty was GREEN! lol it was weird at first but I knew it wasnt rotten or anything it was just the lighting,hubbys salmon wrap was also green. It was still delicious though! so pretty much it depends on where you sit and what time of the day it is,the later it is the more colored your patty will be and if you sit more towards the back in the booths I found thats when your patty turns green :)"}
{"text":"Being a restaurant that bases itself around burgers, you'd think that they'd be able to cook them properly. Unfortunately this is not the case. Second time to this location and both times the burgers were obviously overcooked (first time the burger was terribly under-seasoned and the second time terribly over-seasoned--perhaps a Breathalyzer should be installed in the kitchen?). I'm uncertain as to whether they train the line-cooks to touch a burger to test for tenderness (which helps with gauging for how done a patty is, seeing that the cooks here need help with that). The service was generally inattentive and absent-minded. However, if the meat weren't overcooked, it might have been quality meat. In the restaurant business, though, often the older meat is sent out to people who order \"well-done\" (blasphemy). Blu Burger Grille seems to just send out the old, scorched meat to anybody if there's any laying around, is my guess.  Too much for a sub-par burger. I'd rather go back to In-N-Out (blargh). In short, if you have low-expectations or are drunk and wanting to overpay for a meal, you'd love this joint.  Two stars because the bartender made a rather good dirty martini.  Please, to the owner, skip the condescending \"apologetic comment\" to this review. You screwed up twice and pretty badly. Learn and move on."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful late lunch at Blu Burger Grille today.  This was our first visit.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting and the stall, especially our server Anna, were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  My wife had a signature burger and regular fries and I had a \"build-a-burger\" and sweet potato fries.  Both burgers were gourmet in every sense!  My sweet potato fries were the best I've had!  If you can't find (or build) the burger of your dreams at Blu Burger Grille it would be amazing.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was the worst burger joint that I have ever eaten at, and I would know because I am a big time burger junkie, its one of my favorite foods! First off we went on a monday at 1pm so there was no one in the joint, so you would think when you ask for a burger to be cooked at medium, they would perfect it!!!! But no i get, what they call \"perfect kobe beef burger,\" cooked at a charcoal blackened nasty mess! And to top it off there was a hair in my fries, and of course i didnt ask them to make me a new burger because i said if this is what i get when im the only table in here, i cant expect the second go around to be any better! Needless to say, I will never eat here again, and I do not recommend it to anyone else. Especially since i paid 13 for a Kobe Beef burger, that looked like something you get from the walmart meat section!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to talk to the owner after a few missed communication attempts and was able to let him know my experience happened before my review and was pleased to receive an apology and that was greatly appreciated!!! In my opinion just reaching out shows that he cares and values his customers opinion. I will defantly give them a try again."}
{"text":"Excellent burger choices! I built my own, which was the best choice IMO. Best party is the burger was actually cooked to the doneness I asked for!! That is worth 4 stars alone. Prices were very reasonable too, $10/burger and $5/beer. Service was all also excellent.  No reason i wouldn't find an excuse to come back! 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but my experience was good. The cheese fries were very good the burger was good too I don't really have anything negative to say it's a small place though so if you're with a large group I don't think this place is ideal for you. It's a sitdown restaurant but it's kind of an in and out feel."}
{"text":"Food is always spot on, haven't had one bad plate yet. Club house sandwich was delicious side of sweet potatoe fries, wife had the Blu Chicken, shared each others halves. Service was good talking care of things and a water dish for the pups. Get here early as they do have early hours during the week."}
{"text":"It's an alright place. Their burgers are ok. My opinion, the burger portion is a little large, maybe a little too seasoned. Their fries are plain, nothing I would eat alone. I can't really find a charm to my experience or the place, its just ok. Would eat here again if around the are, but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Something I'd like to point, I've seen this place before, never though to visit, the outside looks like it's a place to a \"healthy\" burger place. I will go back a second time and update this review."}
{"text":"I have given this place five stars in the past but it has gone way down hill. The meat on my burger was tasteless. In my opinion when you don't toast the bun, your not even trying to make a good burger. Our waitress was very friendly, which goes a long way with me but, that burger was bad! I do realize that places have off days so I gave them another chance. Unfortunately, my burger and my husbands burger were the same. Unseasoned meat, untoasted bun = not a good burger :-( What happened to the delicious burgers they use to make? I'm giving them two stars only because our waitress was great!"}
{"text":"I am a Tru Burger fan from when it was called Blue Burger. My wife thins their Turkey Burger is the best she has ever had. I had the \"special\" which was the Pastrami Burger and it was very good. Just the write balance of ingredients. They are a little pricy in my opinion but worth the expense occasionally. Staff is friendly. Cook is a little slow. But, all in all, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"My food was \"ok\" too much bun for the burger and pretty greasy. The server was very friendly and attentive and so was the bus boy.   I was very offended by the owner yelling at our server, who was doing a great job,  for being \"too attentive\"  we are regulars at other restaurants typically because we enjoy the atmosphere which the server usually has a lot to do with.  He was rude and harsh! Then came back and \"acted\" very nice to us after we just witnessed the way he treated her. He should have paid more attention to the 2 servers gossiping about him at the front door. (We were seated at the 1st table and could hear their very inappropriate conversation)  We will not return and will not recommend!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal! We started out with the green bean fries and wasabe sauce, then we both did the build your own burger. The veggie burger is the best I've ever had.  He had the Kobe beef and he loved it."}
{"text":"Its one of the best burgers i've tasted in a long time because its not raised with antibiotics and it also doesnt have growth hormones"}
{"text":"I was craving a burger.  So I went to Blu Burger and boy did it hit the spot.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the location.  You can bring dogs on the patio. So next time my dogs will join me. :)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait.   Very long wait time to take our order, despite having plenty of staff. Burger was very good."}
{"text":"Order the blu burger, it is wonderful, the combination of caramelized onions, gorgonzola cheese and applewood bacon is divine.   They also have a build your own burger options which is nice.   The sweet potato fries are excellent and the service is fabulous.   They are now serving breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays, can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Since management has change the quality of food has also change. Very disappointing and the prices are on the higher end. I do not believe it is worth going back or even trying again. Customer service is awesome however not great enough to go back to try the food again."}
{"text":"On occasion I would see this place and I've always wanted to go in and try it. Well I finally did and it was good! I really liked how they allowed you to build your own burgers in many delicious Ways. If you're a burger person you need to stop in and check this place out oh yeah the zucchini fries were also very delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on Father's Day. Good burger but even better show!!!   We watched the servers and manager go round and round.  Clearly employee and manager issues.  It was like a live Ramsey series.  You may need to go when it is cooler out. The air must not keep up with all the windows.  Employees had their own personal battery powered fans so this must not have been a one time event.    What an odd experience."}
{"text":"Good place!!! Had the pear salad which was served in a trough and could've served everyone in the restaurant!  Was very good and thankfully the salad wasn't soggy from the warm chicken!  We had the buffalo chips and for homemade chips, they were so crispy!  I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Blu Burger is A-OK for me. I like the fact that they offer grass fed beef and bison burgers.  You can create your own, which is what I would  recommend.    Both their grass fed and bison burgers are very good.  You have several choices of toppings starting with their bun - wheat, onion or white.  I do think their buns are too big and found myself removing the top bun so I could enjoy the taste of the beef and bison.  Get their roasted red pepper sauce and add a few toppings to go with it.  Skip their fries, they tasted pre-frozen and go for their zucchini fries.  They are a bit mushy inside but crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with Blu Burger. The service was good, the food was good and I liked the atmosphere. I got the habanero burger with onion rings. The waitress said the habo sauce was very hot and it would be best if it was put on the side. I said sure. I'm glad she did as it wasnt too hot, but I didnt really care for the flavor. A1 as the sauce, much better. The wife got the American burger. I got a bite of that and it was very good also. She got regular fries and the were good with malt vinegar. We split a fried cheesecake desert with caramel sauce. I'm not much on sweet things, but it was very good as well. Next time I think I'll get a Kobe burger. It is quite a bit more expensive than your average sit down burger joint.  I think its probably third on my list. 5 guys and Fuddruckers. 5 guys is the best hands down. This isnt really part of the review, but I just kept thinking, Grimaldi's is next door. Oh how I live Grimaldi's.   Strong 4 stars. It was like $40 with tip and we didnt get any alcohol. I read on their website, mon and tues are buy one burger get one free with buying 2 drinks."}
{"text":"This place had some good food! I had the hot pastrami: to die for. I really enjoyed it. It was a pretty big sandwhich with Swiss cheese, cole slaw, and 1000 island dressing."}
{"text":"The Blu Burger Survey on yellow sheet paper - I have been coming to Blu Burger for many years - I miss the Freshness it use to be - Fresh Bread - Fresh Garlic Rolls with Fresh Moist Salmon & the Fresh Green Salad. The Salmon use to cover the whole roll now its really thin & dried out & does not cover the whole roll. RIPP OFF. I was there on 08/28/2014 and as the last time my Salmon was DRIED out & the Greens were Wilty  The Bread was way to done to & it was COLD when it was served to me. The bathroom did not smell this time around. I brought my friend over here for her birthday lunch she had the Cobb Salad & she enjoy it.  My meal was awful. Just saying. The owner came over to say hi & he has talked to me one other time & I shared to him what I thought. Of course he did not like constructive criticism. There was this nagging dirty fly flying around our food and as I was paying for our meal the fly fell on my receipt in the black waitress book & I told the waitress by the way the fly that has been dreadfully flying around our table dropped dead in your black book. She looked in her book & walked away - she did not say a word. I will never bring anymore friends over this way. I use t o come in with my seniors & husband for we use to take them to the movies or I go to Victoria Secret.  Quality is really BAD - Prices are UP & no more Greatness or Freshness in  this place. They did managed to get all new bathroom put in - it use to be when you walk in the bathroom the drain on the floor always had water around it & it really stunk in there.  I had to ask for Refills for our Water to - the waitress never came over after she served our food & ask how everything was. She came by like 20 minutes later & we had  NO Water. Bahh.... I have been coming here since 2010. My husband & I came in here all the time & it use to be FRESH & GREAT. 4 years later really went down hill usually bad Quality Food. I asked how fresh the Salmon was (always do) The owner said he orders his Salmon every 2 days. I think for this price it should be brought in daily for it's Poultry - Poultry should not be sitting around. I teach the obesity on how to eat & read ingredients & Blu Burger use to be very selective on their Quality of Food Choice. Not No more. Janine Evans"}
{"text":"The menu offers chili nachos,  but I asked if they would make me some chili fries. They were so nice & accommodated my request. The best chili fries I've had! Then I ordered the California burger which was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend it. The $1 extra charge for the zucchini fries was a steal. Blu Burger is my new goto when I'm craving a juicy,  yummy burger!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and thought to give it a try today with my wife. I Loved the bison burger, very flavourful and jucy. my wife ordered the kobe and said the best burger she has ever had. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amber made the visit fantastic. The portions were generous and her recommendation for the green bean fries was spot on.  We also got the Buffalo chips which were delicious. I made my own burger and it was delicious and cooked just right."}
{"text":"We went to the movie right door , we just decided to try it out. The place was cute love the patio especially with the great weather we are having . The server where trying to figure who was going to take our order , finally we got a server . It took  about 40 minutes to get our burgers. They were ok .  I did had to send mine back to cook some more it was rare.Our bill came to  $36 for 2 burger,fries, and 2 sodas. Are you serious!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and our server Brianna was a doll! Only compliant is that its pretty hot in there, needs a better ac!!!"}
{"text":"I went here one day because I was starving on a Sunday evening. Grimaldis was cleaning their oven so I stepped in to try something new. This is now my favorite burger place! The Blu Burger is ahhhhh-mazing! Service was awesome as well.   Craving a burger? You need to make a trip and check this place out."}
{"text":"Just went in here 1/19/17 and there was a smell so strong we had to leave.  The restrooms were giving it off and it makes the whole place smell like a urinal. I understand it may not be the companys fault as it looks like they have a sewage smell issue with the building but they need to let the owners of the property know so as a fix may happen if not I doubt many will go in sorry."}
{"text":"Built my own bison burger which was delicious you can't really go wrong with a burger. Meat was cooked just as I wanted. Ordered a side of sweet potato fries and was disappointed. They were dry and over cooked. They were more like sweet potato chips because they were hard and crunchy. Service was alright not the best I've had. The decor is hideous the blue windows can really hurt the eyes. I would recommend eating outside, inside smells terrible like they have a bad sewer line. You think they would fix the problem."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh, build your own hamburger and fast customer service . Definitely new favorite place"}
{"text":"RACIST, RACIST, RACIST! If I could give 0 stars, I would! Decided to give this place a try after moving into the apartments here at Park West and I wasn't even there 5 minutes before I left! Walked in and patiently waited to be seated with my friend while several employee stood around. After a few minutes, a couple walked in behind us and was immediately acknowledged. When we told the server that we were waiting to be seated, she told us to seat ourselves! Did I mention we are black? Couple was white of course. I would never recommend this place to anyone for any reason!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome will come back again husband had chicken wings also good. Very nice waitress"}
{"text":"Went to Blu Burger on a recommendation  from a family member.  We are visiting and don't know the area enough to know where to eat.  It was a casual environment with friendly staff.  Food was delicious.   Made my own burger and everything tasted fresh.  My zucchini fries were cooked perfectly.  The burger itself was tasty and cooked exactly as ordered.  Even the kiddos meals were tasty as I sampled a couple of their regular french fries cooked crispy but not overdone.  My husband enjoyed the southwest burger as well.  Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 burgers and one of them didn't even have a bun on it. The other one was rare when I asked for well done. The food also had no flavor at all, worst burger I ever had in my life! I rather eat McDonald's. Over priced for trash food. I recommend no ones comes to eat at tru bum burgers..."}
{"text":"I have tried to give this place a chance and this is 3rd time I have been and I just had to write this review. There is a reason that all the other restaurants in park west are busy with the exception of this place.  We went in on a slow Sunday afternoon we stood up there waiting to be sat for at least 5 minutes.  There was only two servers and both were very lax. Our server forgot our appetizer.. didn't even have it on our receipt and I don't think she realized that she forgot it.  An order was messed up and took too long to get it fixed so my daughter just ended up eating at home. And of course because service was so slow,  our food was ice cold when it came out. My point here,  is avoid this place.. service has been terrible every time and food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I googled to find a bison burger in my area..I was starving for a burger and im on a strict diet that still allows bison and I came across Tru burger & grille... Not only was I greeted promptly and sat in a fast manor, but my server Bo was just simply awesome! Super polite, got my order right, just very great at making me feel at home and being attentive without being over bearing.. My burger was actually cooked at medium and my egg was still runny the way I like it! This place is a little pricy, BUT worth every penny.. I would for sure recommend this place to anyone on strict healthy diets or looking for a clean eating place! I will for sure be back again even though I live on the other side of town!"}
{"text":"Walked in waited about 5 min to be noticed, then they finally took us to the table where we waited over 15 minutes for someone to come up to us. After 15 minutes someone asked if we been helped and we said no he said he was going to send someone right of way, but no one showed up after another 10 min went by so we got up and left. Horrible customer service will never go back to it. Then again west side that's what you get."}
{"text":"A little pricey for burgers but very tasty and our favorite Park West resturant. Service os speedy and the happy hour drinks are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have never had a better burger! The zucchini fries were to die for! Just happened to be in the neighborhood and hungry so I stopped, I had never eaten here before but it was worth the drive, will defiantly come back soon."}
{"text":"This company is the example of Down Town vibes brought to the West Valley. If you are tired of driving down there, tired of the rude and nasty Down Town attitudes and want the same feeling then come down to the TRU place, TRU BURGER.   I have been coming to this place before they changes their name. I see now that they have new prices, new drinks and the same amazing burgers!   I feel like this is a place of enjoyment and a place where you can relax to have some easy sit down fun. The fried food is absolutely amazing, the drinks are well made and very cost-efficient.   This place makes me want to move into the apartments right in the Plaza, who knows... I just might end up using this place as my personal kitchen!    5+ STARS and 1 Cosmic Star"}
{"text":"Too pricey for a dry burger. I can make a better one on my grill. Also Park West reeks of sewer, have fun eating while smelling that!"}
{"text":"Everything is an up charge. Both times I've been there has been good. They do tend to make your order incorrect. Will possibly try them again"}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Can't comment on the food because we walked out but the service was terrible.  Sat down to have a server throw the menus in front of us and run off to help people who came in after us.  They were already ordering food before anyone even asked us for a drink order and then promptly threw the other server under the bus.  When we complained,she didn't even offer to get the manager.  She just made excuses and let us walk out without even an apology."}

{"text":"I usually bet burgers plain to start.   It has to stand alone first.  I got the Bison Burger, $15.00.  It was dry, I expected a dryer burger because the lack of fat in Bison.  Asked for Medium Rare, got Medium-Medium well.   I took a picture then enhanced it, to deepen the color.  I suggest you use the burger as a delivery system for toppings.  Put 3 of the strongest toppings, maximum sauces to give it flavor.   I would happily pay $5.00 or $6.00 for this burger.  I have had bison fir years, most of the time it has flavor, sometimes it tastes of feed lot....  No taste at all.    In fact I suggest you bring your own cheese, a Limburger, Maytag, or one of the strongest cheeses to give it something!   About a table spoon of Tobacco Sauce or  Dragons tongue pepper would help as well.     The burger was from frozen bison and had to have been pressed, and turned serval times to get it that dry.  For $15.00 I expect fresh not frozen meat!     The wait staff was very good.  I will not penalize the waitress to inferior food....  Or fast food quality burger."}
{"text":"Habenero Burger - (MR) arguably the best burger I've ever eaten. Fresh bun, flavorful habenero sauce, and everything cooked perfect from sauteed onions to a perfect medium rare. Salad was a side note with good bleu cheese dressing.   Sports TV for the wandering eye or weary traveller, uh me.  Changed a TV to Rousey vs. Tate replay..... Stoked!    Full bar for those looking, doesn't jive with family friendly atmosphere or food.  Opinion - more local beers on tap and ditch the liquor, evaluate business swing either with and without.  Thanks Blu,  Super Good!"}
{"text":"Solid burger place. Gave it a 4 b/c only one burger place in my opinion is a 5 in this world and that Kuma's Corner in Chicago. If you're ever in Chicago go there no matter how long the line is...its 100% worth it! Anyway back to this place...started off with the wings which were okay. I'm more a dry rub kind of guy when it comes to wings and these wings were swimming in sauce. The wings I thought were cooked well just to \"wet\" for me. I then had the bleu burger which was really good. The burger was huge which is always a plus in my book and then caramelized onions, nice thick bacon, and blue cheese all worked really well together. Finished the meal off with a \"pizza cookie\" or \"cookie pizza\"..something like that..which was essentially a huge cookie in a small pizza pan type of dish with vanilla ice cream. It was a nice sweet way to end the meal. Bottom line if I want a burger I would def. come back here. Only downfall I really experienced was that getting the food out to us was a bit slow in my opinion and I'm not sure if our waitress had a hearing problem or something but I had to keep repeating my order. Anyway that stuff wouldn't keep me from coming back here. Solid place."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for sometime and thought I'd go back since going to a movie. I had the Kobe burger and it was very good. I like the fact you can build your own burger to how you like it and it's a good size burger. Service was good as well and like the fact that the movie theater is walking distance."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the servers were on top of things! All four of us ordered different burgers; all of which were impressive. I also had the zucchini fries which are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"This small burger joint was a pleasant surprise.  Local grass fed beef and bison on the menu.  Service was great and the food was delicious.  While we were there a family showed up with thier dog.  The dog was brought water first.  Gotta love a place that treats animals just as well as thier customers. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great service.  Walked in, greeted immediately and seated in a booth.  Wait staff was attentive and made sure the drinks were always full.    Food was good.  Variety of burgers and toppings were plenty.    Price is OK.  The burger prices are reasonable.  For the price of the sides, I would have expected larger portions."}
{"text":"During a day of shopping, my best friend suggested that we grab some food from Blu Burger Grill... I had never heard of it before, and I wasn't exactly sure what to think... considering I'm usually very picky about my burgers.   I decided to go with the \"Build Your Own\" Triple Mini Burgers and O-M-G. I LOVE them. Perfect size, perfect portions. And their pizza cookie is excellent as well!  Overall, this place is awesome. Excellent service, and excellent food. What more could you ask for?   My only problem with this place is that if you go for a booth, make sure you get it next to a window that doesn't have the blue film over it. You will start to find yourself feeling a little dizzy before too long."}
{"text":"This is just your average sit down burger place nothing special just expensive remember coming here when it used to be blue Burger didn't like it then didn't we like it this time for the $14 you pay for the burger must go somewhere else Burgers dry didn't like the bun taste a little stale no real flavor juiciness and everything server was kind of unattentive took forever get drinks probably never go back"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!!  And guess what?!  They do breakfast and you can bring your dog for patio dining too!!  They have awesome omletes and protein pancakes for those who are cutting calories.  Burgers and salad are awesome, its a lot of good so beware!  Try the sweet potatoe fries too. You have to try the burger with goat cheese its so good, it sounds gross but its not!  Pizza cookie dessert is like heaven served in a baking pan."}
{"text":"This IS A MUST try place! Had the kobe beef build your own burger....THE BOMB!! Brought my elderly mom (you know how they can be really finicky) she absolutely loved her chicken teriyaki sliders....her plate was clean when done!!  Server Brianna was helpful."}
{"text":"Can't review the food. Couldn't stay in there more than 5 minutes because the stench of the sewer was so bad. Shocked we didn't see that in other reviews."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food!  Great times.    Outside is wonderful in the evening and especially on the weekend.  Inside is very enjoyable.  The game is always on on the numerous flat screen TVs hung about the place.  I truly enjoy it here."}
{"text":"Prices are ok, but the burgers and portions are huge! Free wifi... awesome location... I can't find anything bad to say about this place. I wish happy hour was better..."}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was super helpful and she caught a wrong order from the kitchen  but after being on the road for 6 hrs and calling ahead to get an order ready for pick up . We showed and had to sit for an additional 15-20 minutes while they fixed it- that sucked. I was ready to walk out if I wasn't stuck"}
{"text":"Second time are at the one in Anthem service was slow and then the one off of Northern service was just as bad as Anthem. Food is descent but if I can't get service why bother?"}
{"text":"I love this burger place it's cozy and nice not too loud had a football game playing but not so loud where u can't talk to others. The burgers were so good. I decided to try to create my own and got the Kobe beef burger and it was so good half way through it I was full but wanted to keep eating still didn't finish it but I loved my burger my husband got the American burger and he likes his as well. Prices are not that bad and you get a good size burger two hand hold kind or cut in half and eat. Definitely enjoyed my burger and will come back"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Love being able to burgers in a healthy way.  Cole slaw best I've had!"}
{"text":"My daughter & I just happened to find this place one night & I am so glad we did!  Absolutely one of my favorite places!  We usually get the turkey burger w/goat cheese & a fried egg & sweet potatoe fries.  They are more than happy to split the plate for $2 which you then get your own portion of fries.  They have a great chipolte mayo & red pepper sauce which we use for dipping our fries in which is super nummy.  Then for desert they have a chocolate chip pizza....basically cc cookie dough thats not quite all the way cooked with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream....to die for!!!   I can't recommond this place enough.  It's not a real big place & the service is good.  Go to the Blu Burger & thank me later. :O)"}
{"text":"Yum :) best burger I've had in a long time. Even my daughter who always just picks at her plate managed to chow down every last bite."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 2 years. Its a monthly tradition.  The best burgers I've had in az. I recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but it is a bit pricey. It has a great atmosphere. I really enjoyed the zucchini fries not to soft and not to crunchy. I had the Southwest burger and it was very delicious I would definitely get it again! I like that you can customize your own burger and fit it to your liking. I like the bison burger, the meat is hard to describe but it's definitely something to try! The server that we had was really nice, gave us privacy, and refilled our drinks as needed. Great place to try!"}
{"text":"Italian burger was juicy and tasted amazing. The mozzarella was so fresh! The chicken Caesar salad was amazing and fresh. BBQ burger had fabulous flavor!"}
{"text":"I made arrangements to take a group of 18 neighbors here for dinner. Fabulous. Service was great & staff was very accommodating & helpful. They will get repeat business several people said they would be back.  My husband & I will be definitely going back. Great burgers like we had back in the 50's & 60's, juicy & messy."}
{"text":"We out the other night with my Girlfriend, and was craving a good burger.  Since this place is right next to where I live, we walked over.  Couldn't walk out fast enough.    If you are in the mood for a bland burger....this is your place.  And if you are looking for a place where the decor is as annoying as the bad service....this is definately your place!  ****UPDATE****  So, after writing this, I received an email from a person claiming to be the owner of the restaurant.  They said they were sorry for the bad experience, and would like for me to come back, all the while informing me that they had a hard time believing that the burger was just as I said....bland.  (Rule #1 in business.....Your clients perception is their reality)  After a few emails, this person asked for my mailing address, and again asked me to come back sometime.  To this day, I have not received whatever it may be that I was suppose to receive by mail.    I would encourage anyone who chooses to go to Blu Burger to just look for another spot.  In my opinion, your $ will be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"burger was good, service was great, the set up is ok but nothing i would expect for a high end burger joint.  too institutional feel for me, too bright or too something i just don't know?"}
{"text":"Out shopping and found this restaurant tucked away in a shopping center. The atmosphere is really relaxed with great music playing and sports on. I will definitely be coming back to enjoy this place and their good food!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure bison burgers were frozen patties. Not great for the prices. Expected way better based on previous reviews. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was incredibly surprised by the quality of the burgers.  The sweet potato fries were amazing.  Atmosphere and seating was great for a burger joint.  Zucchini Fries - really great as well!"}
{"text":"There are SO many reasons to love this place, which is why I keep going back for more! If I'm having a bad week, it's amazing how \"Let's go to Blu Burger\" can turn everything around. (Pathetic? A little.  But this place is truly that magical.)  Reasons to love Blu Burger:  1) It's family-owned.  Rather than supporting a big corporation, you're giving your business to the little guy.  2) Great customer service.   3)Affordable. A burger-with-a-side is around the $10 range.  They also run a happy hour special - I believe Mon-Thursday till 6 - featuring some deep-fried appetizers and cheap drinks.  4) The location.  This is a great dinner-and-a-movie place, since it is right next to Harkins.  5) The food is SO GOOD.  I would like to personally recommend the buffalo chips, which are these homemade potato chips drizzled with blue cheese and buffalo sauce.  Dip them in the ranch and you will be in a food coma in no time.  The onion rings at this place are of the fat, beer-battered variety, also complimented nicely by the ranch. The sweet potato fries are delicious as well; I recommend those with chipotle mayonnaise dipping sauce. On a recent trip, I ventured outside my box and tried the wings.  Surprise! They are spectacular as well.  As for the main course, you will fall in LOVE with the burgers here.  I love the bison burger with all the trimmings, but the Kobe is great as well.  If you aren't in a burger mood, the \"blu chicken\" sandwich is a great choice (with ranch on the side for dipping).  I love how the side salads are of the leafy green variety, as opposed to the dry iceberg lettuce ones that are so common.   I was never a burger person before, but this place has turned me into a snob.  It's hard to go back to white-bread, greasy burgers after having the quality this place delivers.  Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"We had burgers and garlic parm fries.  One build your own burger and a bacon/cheese/with onion ring burger on brioche bun.  Burger was pretty decent..  cooked medium as requested.  Came out hot.  Warning...The garlic parm fries were like a punch in the face...not sure if they always come that potent but the garlic parm was strong.  Flavorful and tasty but crazy garlic aroma.  Actually was a bit much as we brought doggy bag home and not only stunk up the car but our entire fridge smelled like garlic the next morning.  They were good when eating hot and fresh but did not want garlic anytime soon after"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was a sit down restaurant I thought it was going to be fast food but I was in shock when we got seated. I ordered two appetizers for my table the fried pickles and the buffalo chips. The fried pickles I thought were going to be slices which they should be because it's very difficult to eat the fried pickle in a whole when it's hot. The buffalo chips with the hot sauce and blue cheese on top was just incredible such a simple idea that makes you so happy you got them. So I saw the build your own burger thing on the menu and decided to do that because I like making it my own. So sad knowing all the stuff I asked for went to waste because they got the main thing wrong for a burger. I asked specifically medium well and I got well done with no juice left in the patty. There was no taste in the meat. It was gross I didn't even wanna look at it to be honest. Burger place but the meat has no taste to it? Kinda weird no? I like fries on the side they were called Parm Fries or something those were tasty. Buffalo chips and fries are the only thing good here. 45$ for two burgers and one appetizer.. Plus a tip? So 50+$? Not worth it.."}
{"text":"I've been to Blu Burger Grill a couple of times. The first time I wasn't blown away. It was good but not fantastic. This time was actually better. The manager that runs the place provides great service.  I ordered the mix basket and grass fed burger w/ tomato, spinach, red onion, pepper jack, and mustard on wheat with a side salad.  The mix basket came with onion rings, french fries, and sweet potato fries. It was hot fresh and tasty. the batter on the onion rings wasn't too light or too heavy. The burger was cooked perfectly and also delicious. the side salad was just OK. Nothing special nothing bad. My wife and I split the entire meal and were both full.  The bill came out to 26 bucks with drinks. Not exactly a bargain but we weren't eating at Wendy's either.  In summary, if you are in the area going to the movies or even a game at Westgate Blu Burger may be worth taking a look."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time with family and the food has always been great! Today I ordered the caprise salad with garlic parm fries (happy hour discount on the fries!). Its so frakkin' delicious! Chris, my server was a great smiling presence and kept my water topped off! 10/10 will nom again!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't eat a lot of burgers, however, I still love some me good eats.  I was really looking forward to trying the Blu Burger Grille.  My love of all things blue (the color, the cheese, the fruit, etc.) had me ready to add Blu Burger Grille to my list.  While I can't say it was my favorite burger of all time, I can say they have a great concept and a tasty burger.  As many other reviews have mentioned, the decor is very blue and yet plain otherwise.  Not really a big deal, I don't like clutter anyway.  The Build Your Own Burger concept is great!  I could spend twenty minutes deciding what I'm going to order and discussing with the group what they are going to order.  With so many different options for the patty, the bun (or bun substitute), the sauce, the toppings, and the extras the combinations are almost limitless.  For those of us that can take too long to make decisions (guilty), they have a few suggestions for burger combos, another great idea!  Also, the option of salad, sweet potato fries, or onion rings as a side make a great menu in my book!  My California Burger with swiss, sauteed mushrooms, and avocado was pretty good.  The bottom part of the wheat bun got soggy quicker than I would have liked and the top seamed like a lot of bread, but the burger tasted good; I was too busy eating to bother mentioning it to the table.  Sweet potato fries were decent.  I also got to try a BYOB turkey burger and a Blu Burger.  I was very impressed with the moistness of the turkey burger and thought the amount of blue cheese on the Blu Burger was a little overpowering.  As I said, I love stinky blue cheese, but it is a strong cheese and you really don't need much to get the flavor across.  Overall, the options are fun, the burgers are good, service is fine and I left satisfied with no regrets.  Next time I'm in Peoria and craving a burger, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I visited this place two days in a row for lunch while working in the area. The food was really good, the service was great. First day I did the build your own burger with Kobe beef and the second visit was another build your own but with Angus beef. Both were perfect they also have Bison and other meats to choose from. I also ordered  both visits for the table a plate they called Buffalo Chips, they are either house/home made chips with Buffalo wings sauce, blu cheese crumbles, & Blu cheese dressing on them. Both groups loved them and would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Horrible. My bread was so hard it felt like i was biting into a tumbleweed. I could use that bread to break a window. Crazy slow service. Ill never go back hope that place runs into the ground."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional here, especially the salmon and burgers.  The wait staff is awesome...one is just a bit too talkative at times.  They have an amazing patio that you are able to eat outside almost year around.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome burger! I stopped by Blu Burger last week for lunch and absolutely loved their signature Blu Burger with Kobe beef. Definitely order their sweet potato fries with chipotle sauce....amazing!  Service was great, we were in a bit of hurry and had no problem getting in and out."}
{"text":"This place is becoming one of our regular spots! Our favorite thing to order there, oddly enough, is the chips and salsa. You've gotta try it! The salsa is perfect - not too spicy - garlicky, all the things salsa should be, and the chips come out fresh and hot. My husband always gets a burger medium rare, and has never had any complaints; he loves them! I usually order the portobello mushroom, on brioche, with mozzarella and tomatoes. It's really really good. They season the mushroom really well- lots of garlic on that, too; maybe don't order that, if you're on a first date  Everything's fresh and yummy, and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place. I live in Vegas and was visiting Phoenix and looking for a good burger. Turned to Yelp and decided on this spot.   Very nice location in an upscale shopping area. We went at lunchtime and sat on the outdoor patio (which is dog friendly- pretty awesome). We were the only ones outside. The server was nice enough to change the channel to accommodate us and get some March Madness basketball on.   What with the build your own burger option. I got Angus beef, Applewood smoked bacon, garlic, red onions, jalapeños. Got a chipotle and habanero sauce on the side and the skinny fries. Was definitely one of the better burger experiences that I've had in the recent past.   If you haven't been here, I highly recommend you give it a shot. I will definitely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I had the green chili. It had a real roasted poblano chili on it . The guacamole was good and spicy.  I also had a kilt lifter beer , also good,"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give them 10 stars.  We are from the Central Coast of California and were visiting GCU for the weekend.  We had lunch here on August 2, 2015 after shopping in the area.  There were 5 of us in our party and each of us ordered something different.  I had the Bison Burger.  The service was superb!!  We were seated right away and our order was taken quickly.  Staff was nice and friendly. Every meal was outstanding and went far beyond our expectations!!  We will definitely come back again and will recommend to all the GCU students and parents in our area.  Lori"}
{"text":"Pretty good prices! Burgers are very big and super tasty. Love the presentation of the food and the workers were nice. Super clean too."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Kinda pricey for a burger but the quality is above par so it goes hand in hand. Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"We went to this wonderful hamburger place right before the Dixie Chicks concert! This had the best looking and best tasting burgers in the Phoenix metropolitan area! Hands down! We totally enjoyed our food! Bo, our waiter was a rockstar and impressive. We had a great time there, even though the people that were eating at other tables looked at us like we must be from Texas because I was wearing my cowgirl hat and my daughter was decked out in red, white and blue with a matching blinged out cap.. America! We wanted good hamburgers before the concert and we definitely found the hidden palace for burgers on the west side of town! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had kobe beef and my wife built her bison. She loved hers... I was pretty happy with mine.  Our server Desiree was really great! We were also greeted by a host who was friendly and took the time to ask us how we liked the burgers!   As someone who has worked around retail property management I've got this insane ability to pick apart stuff. I dunno if it's a blessing or a curse?! But... if I could suggest to the management... have your floor drains checked asap. The average customer isn't going to notice that not quite right smell. And for the love of all things, please especially have them service the one in the women's bathroom. That rotting smell is coming from the aging plumbing and organics from cleaning the floors going down the drain.  You have my word... I'll change this to 5 stars happily once I get word it's been taken care of!  Well done BluBurger!"}
{"text":"Just starting out on vacation and not knowing our way around AZ, I turned to Yelp for a decent lunch spot for 5 hungry (borderline hangry) people. One doesn't eat health-food, or even vegetables really; One is nearly a vegetarian. Three of us would've eaten our own fists at this point.   Enter Blu Burger Grill. This spot seemed perfect, as they offered sandwiches, salads and the most enticing thing - build your own burger, where a 'burger' includes Beef, Kobe Beef, Bison, Turkey, Salmon Filet, Veggie Burger or a Grilled Portabella Mushroom. Sigh. Of. Relief.  This location is set up at a mall and seemed relatively new-ish. The decor (as mentioned in previous reviews) is hideous. But, we were seated right away and all seemed to find something we liked on the menu.  I went with the Build-Your-Own Bison Burger ($14) and was a little underwhelmed. They offer a lot of topping options, but the really good stuff is all $1 extra per topping. I got some veggies, cheese and added guacamole for $1 anyway and asked for the herb mayo on the side (sauce was a freebie). I thought my burger was okay but the bun was way too big for the amount of meat. Super bready and kind of hard - I ended up leaving behind over half of the bun. They didn't put much guac on and forgot the herb mayo, which I was pretty much over at that point. I opted for zucchini fries as my side and enjoyed them, though I thought they were a little stingy on the portion.   Everyone seemed pretty satisfied while eating (like I said, we were all starving) and I have to say the sandwich that looked the best was a Chicken Sandwich on what looked like sourdough.   The service was kind of slow, it was pretty packed and I think only 1 or 2 servers were working. Luckily we got our order in before the rush. Overall, I'm glad we went - everyone found something they liked and no one had to compromise."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the blu burger which had grilled onions and blue cheese on a roll and it was fantastic. My husband had the American burger with sweet potato fries. His fries and burger were also very good. The onion rings that I paid $1 extra to have were just ok. I'm just not a big fan of that style of batter, but that's a matter of opinion. So a $12 burger +$1 more for onion rings seems a little pricey to me. It seemed like we came in just as the breakfast rush was winding down so it took a long time to get our food, and also a long time to get the check. I don't think I'd go out of my way to stop at this place due to the cost and service, but not at all due to quality of the food."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place is amazing, best jalapeño burger I've EVER had. Staff was super friendly but genuine, really appreciate this place! Prices seem high but comes with great fries and burger is delicious. Money well spent!! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We stopped in because we had some time to share before our movie and didn't eat yet. It did not disappoint us! I ordered the wings as a \"snack\", and I got so much food that I even had to bring some home! The bbq wings are DELICIOUS! Excellent service, and very clean restaurant. Definitely stop in when you're around! - we will be back, and next time we will bring family!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Amber was amazing! Gave suggestions very personable. Can't wait to come back. Bison burger was very good."}
{"text":"My bf and I both got make-your-own burgers (I ordered bison and he ordered kobe) and thought they were absolutely amazing.  There are so many choices. Make sure you go when you're hungry bc it is a LOT of burger! Service was fantastic"}
{"text":"We love the burgers and the wait staff is always very pleasant. My only complaint is that the owners need to clean it up a bit."}
{"text":"Service was incredible and the burgers were just amazing. We're new to the Phoenix area, and we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Groupon lured me in here, and I'm so glad! I'm not that \"into\" burgers, but my sweetie is, so I couldn't pass up the deal. The place is very clean and cool looking with the brightly painted murals on the wall. I liked that the menu wasn't over crowded with random options but still had something for everyone. We both chose build-your-own grass-fed burgers on onion buns, medium rare with different accoutrements.   Everything turned out great! Burgers were cooked perfectly, just the right amount of toppings applied, and they came out just as we ordered. Plus the servers were on the ball and super friendly. Also great were the sides! I got sweet potato fries but ate more of my dates zucchini fries instead. This worked out bc he ate more of mine than his. I LOVED the zucchini fries SO much, I will go back just for them. A great experience except for one tiny thing. It smelled funny inside! We got used to it eventually, but upon first being seated we both commented on the funny  aroma of the place. Hopefully this is not the norm. I thought it smelled fishy and could be attributed to the salmon patties I saw on the menu, but who knows. I will smell it again next time."}
{"text":"Another fun visit! I am a big fan of the Pear Chicken salad. Lovely goat cheese that gets all melty from the warm grilled chicken...mmmmm. The mango iced tea is nice too. Not too sweet or too fruity. It's nice to have healthy choices amid the movie theater and Grimaldis..which I love. :) Definitely hit this place up. The burgers are yum and definitely give this salad a try!"}
{"text":"The service stood out more than the food. Our server was awesome. I had the bison burger, it was ok didn't taste well seasoned and more than likely not fresh but frozen patty and over cooked. To charge that much it should be fresh and juicy. My family ordered the Kobe burgers, not bad but nothing to write home about. We've been to way better burger bars to put it gently. Oh and green bean and zucchini fries were really good but you only get a handful of each. :("}
{"text":"Food was good as always.  The atmosphere is so cool with everything being blue inside."}
{"text":"Was a last minute go to but it was a good burger..we had a party of 7, 2 were kids, they had a good kids menu. They have build your own burger with pretty good building options,  they also have bison,  Turkey and chicken you can build as well. Burgers are a little pricy but good...a ok beer selection. They do have tip included for big parties FYI..."}
{"text":"Good service but disappointing food. Our California burger was dry... Which is hard to do given then mushrooms on top. The buns were stale. My pear salad was full of flavors that just don't go together. We usually don't eat at places unless they are 4 stars. We made an exception on this one and we are bummed we did."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this establishment and after an amazing day at the farmers market we were ready to settle down and eat some delicious food. Instead we got 2 overcooked burgers and a combative manager. The manager was our waiter and forgot to bring out chocolate milk for one of the kids (not really a big deal). Two of our burgers were extremely overcooked, we asked for medium and recieved well done and we had to ask 3 different servers for napkins before we got them.  After I reviewed all of this with the manager/waitress she responded back with \"First of all\" and as you can imagine it all went downhill from there. She went on to say she's not back there making the food and no one asked her for napkins. I was absolutely stunned at the lack of empathy and ownership.   They say a manager can cost an organization millions of dollars and its the truest statement I've ever heard. She represents your brand and she represented it poorly.   We will NEVER be going there again"}
{"text":"Never disappointed here.  Always trying something new then deciding that we have a new favorite.  Just had a daily special Buffalo Chicken sandwich that I hope makes it onto the regular menu. Hard to decide between garlic/Parmesan fries or the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The manager is so nice! He let me and my boyfriend in after they closed to enjoy a drink while waiting for our movie! So polite I really appreciate the good customer service! Will be back to try the food. Glancing over at the other tables that were still finishing their food the burgers looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here the other week and got the habanero burger and zucchini fries... so yummy. The staff was also super friendly!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Cute place but for what you spend on a couple burgers, fries and beers you could do better elsewhere. I only gave this place 3 Stars due to the prices, long waits to be acknowledged at the bar, and getting our first round. Started out with the buffalo wings, with mild sauce and that was pretty good because they were crispy. We were seated at the bar when I noticed the couple next to us seemed to be waiting a long time for their food. They ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and that was at least 20-25 minutes.  Next we received the Burgers we ordered a few minutes after we finished the wings. Perfect timing! The Burger I had was the Angus with Bleu Cheese. Awesome!  Fries were nothing special. Luckily for me I requested 1000 Island on the side because had it been on the burger I would have left. I had a feeling that would be a wise move because after tasting it I noticed a heavy dose of cinnamon in the dressing.  Whoever had the idea to do this should be slapped. Don't overthink things people, 1000 the traditional way is what I was after. Wife had the Kobe burger. Loved it and she chose wisely with the onion rings.  I was jealous!  Way better than the boxed frozen variety. Anyway, I'd come back but this place appears to be run by amateurs. I don't want to be mean, but the lack of teamwork and everyone on the staff looks like they just do kind of whatever they want. Maybe a good candidate for Kitchen Nightmares or Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible. I would recommend looking for another burger joint if that's what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"I'm not generally a big fan of burgers, but I love this place!  Their \"blu burger\" is amazing!  Bleu cheese crumbles, carmelized onions and thick, crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun, oh my!  I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well.  I can't speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new. Heh.  The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow well-behaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal.  They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl!  I've also had great luck with their waitstaff, everyone is friendly and on task.  It's pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered fish and chips.  Not the best idea in a burger place.   They were more like fish sticks.  Tasted like they were frozen and heated up.   Another person at our table got cold fries and all he things on her burger she asked to not have on it.    Maybe caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"Great raw ingredient used for their burgers!  Angus. Thank you for being thoughtful.  Wonderful menu choices. Hubby thought the Califfornia burger was \"bland\".  No pizzazz.  My American Burger nice and American."}
{"text":"First time I came here I thought this was so so. But going back recently at the request of a friend. I did a build your own with angus beef, ham, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, garlic. Really good!"}
{"text":"Nice burger joint. Chris tool good care of us, ask for him. We split a bison burger. it was very tasty with chipotle mayo and spicy mustard. The zucchini fries were crisp. The cole slaw was good, not too soggy. The tropical tea was yummy."}
{"text":"Best service. . Great food!!! Burgers are great.. staff is very friendly..great selection of drinks. . Best place in park west by far..buffalo chips are by far the best"}
{"text":"Gave Tru Burger a 2nd chance. Was extremely pleased. The buns were fresh and tasted like the original buns. The burger was once again juicy and delicious. The zucchini fries are the best. Our server has been there for years and she was absolutely wonderful. Just saw that the owner had responded to my previous review. Judging by our meal on this visit, it was evident that management cares about their customers' opinion. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food. I chose the custom burger. 2nd best sweet potato fries in Valley IMO. Nice that they don't charge extra for them. Just a bit pricey, but it is sit down service so it makes sense. Very friendly and immediate attention."}
{"text":"The only place I found that serves organic non-hormone feed meat and fowl!  Food is great service is great!!  I have been here a half dozen times and I have not been disappointed once! Yum!!! Just delish!"}
{"text":"Tru Burger Co. is a casual build your own burger place with wait service and a comfortable dog friendly patio. They are located in a shopping mall that's one exit from the sports arena.   We sat ourselves on the Dog Friendly patio and quickly we were handed menus. Our server soon greets us with a fresh bowl of water for my dog.   We started with the Green Bean Fries as an appetizer. We received a very generous plate of Fried Green Beans with Dipping sauces. One sauce was a tasty creamy but mild wasabi. The green beans were very tasty but also very substantial. I had to stop eating them or I wouldn't have room for my burger. My dog was very fond of the green beans and they kept her occupied as a train ride strolled by the patio with screaming children. (I was afraid she might bark at them) ($5.95)  I tried the Salmon \"Burger\" wrapped in lettuce and some toppings and onion rings with habanero sauce on the side. My salmon filet was juicy and was seasoned nicely. The onion rings were tasty and the habanero sauce was HOT, really hot and tasty with good flavors. This wasn't a burger that I could pick up and eat. I had to eat it more like a platter. ($16.50)  My husband had the Green Chili Burger with Grass Fed Local Beef. It's an 8oz burger and it came with a tasty chili and not a canned chili. He asked for it medium rare but it came out well on one side and pink on the other side. He said the beef had good flavor to it but the burger wasn't juicy as he was hoping for. He did tell the waitress it was ok..........($14.25)  My husband isn't much of a fish person but he thought my fish burger was delicious and he also liked the onion rings and habanero sauce over what he had.  I'm really feeling a 3.5 today on this place but I rounded it up because of the friendly efficient service, nice patio and the tasty platter I had.  Prices run on the high side and slightly higher than what the website had posted (4-1-17) but the ingredients they use are costly so you have to keep that in mind. The burgers on the suggested menu can save you a few dollars rather than the build your own section."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried pickles I've ever had!  Burgers we're good, service was great!  My yelp app froze when I was trying to redeem my offer but they honored it anyway.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I was very impressed! My friend had the Tru Breakfast but subbed the bison burger for a regular angus beef burger, and I had the Italian burger. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted excellent! I was surprised at their selection of different meats (ranging from kobe beef to salmon burgers). It's true their menu is only limited to mostly burgers, but they do have other things to snack on (hot dogs and other such things), but if the place is called Tru Burger Co. then I would expect that from them. The service is very nice, and if I had to pick one thing to gripe about it's that the food took quite a long time to come out given the sparse amount of customers that were in the restaurant at the time. I know I wasn't the only one who thought this, because a couple of the other groups in the booths started to look around for their food after a while. The food was worth the wait though! And it wasn't that long of a wait; just long enough to notice. What really made me happy was that while the regular Tru Breakfast is around $16 they lowered the price for my friend's substitution! I don't recall the last time that happened anywhere I've been (since usually prices are set and substituting cheaper ingredients changes nothing). Can't wait to try this place again and try my hand at building my own burger next time! They have that option as well!"}
{"text":"Considering this place allows you to create your own burger I was expecting something a lot better. But maybe I was just setting my expectations too high. My husband had the angus burger and I opted for the bison on wheat with spinach, caramelized onions, jalapenos, chipotle mayo and a side of zucchini fries. The fries were excellent, but they serve you such a small portion. 5-6 fries and gone! Burgers were satisfying, but not sure if they were worth the price. For that price for a burger and a tiny portion of a side I'd much rather go to Delux or Fez."}
{"text":"I had their \"Kobe\" burger with bacon, blue cheese and A1 sauce. It was a really big burger! Everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality. But I found the meat to be kind of tasteless. It was good enough though. I'd eat there again given the opportunity. The fries were really good and so was the service."}
{"text":"This place is a real find. The best burgers in pheonix. Sweet potato fries, what a treat!"}
{"text":"Was shopping the farmer's market Saturday with my friend and we decided to grab a bite to eat before heading back home. The smell of burgers wafted through the air as we shopped the market so we hurried around it and made our way over to Blu Burger. The restaurant is indeed BLUE...so we sat outside on the patio which was lovely.   I originally went in intending to order a burger but quickly found that the menu boasted many other choices that looked appealing. After much deliberation, I settled on the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side salad of mixed greens. The salad dressing was a mango vinaigrette that was delicious! The sandwich was served on whole wheat toast with tomato, avocado, applewood smoked bacon, romaine and a light spread of mayo. It was a wonderful tasting sandwich and the salad complimented it perfectly. I will order again for sure next visit.   My friend ordered the bison burger (no bun, wrapped in lettuce) and the side salad without dressing. Per all her special requests, the meal didn't look one bit appetizing to me. But again, if she weren't on a special diet and received the order as it comes, it may have been more appealing. Nonetheless, she said she loved the taste of the burger--her first time having bison--and would order again.   Between the delicious meals and very attentive waitstaff, I'll be taking the hubs here to try out for himself in the very near future."}
{"text":"We go here weekly with our dogs and we will keep going back. The staff is always on point for the most part lots of changes lately but the food has stayed consistent."}
{"text":"Well, we gave it another shot. I ordered the same burger as last time (California burger) and ordered it medium. I told the waiter that last time my burger was overcooked so he said he would make sure it was perfect! When it came out, it was.... Very well done. :( I told the waiter and he sent it back. It came out again well done. So three times now they have not been able to properly cook a burger!!! It was still tasty because of the toppings but I wish they knew how to cook a burger properly. Otherwise, only offer well done burgers because that's the only way the cooks know how to cook a burger."}
{"text":"I love a good burger and Tru Burger is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. The staff was very welcoming and nice. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in here before a movie. It was a chill evening and the people were so nice. We couldn't leave. Skipped the movie and just kicked it here the rest of the night.   The playlist was strong. The drinks were good. We ordered some snack food (fries and buffalo chips).  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have a delicious turkey burger.the service was great and fast.i would definitely return in the future"}
{"text":"First time I've ever left a restaurant hungry.  I ordered well done honey hot chicken wings and I got rubbery undercooked wings in honey.  Asked for blue cheese and got ranch.  Asked for 2 boxes and got one.  Waitress laid out straws out on the table.  Can't see why I would return here."}
{"text":"This is the place my wife and I go when we want a hamburger. A REAL hamburger. When you have a burger craving and no flimsy fast food hamburger will do the trick, come here. Best bets are the titular Blu Burger and BBQ Burger."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken sandwich here has me almost aroused. It's two slices of the most amazing sourdough bread that's been toasted to perfection, with a succulent grilled chicken breast, under lettuce, tomato, and mustard. A bite of this sandwich feels like sheer perfection in my mouth. The bread alone had me asking them where it comes from, it's a local bakery, go figure. It comes with a side of fries and they are nice and crispy. The decor is very blue....but I like to sit outside anyway."}
{"text":"Clean, good but not the fastest services.  Can get pricey as well.  I would go back in a heart beat if I could"}
{"text":"Fine, but too expensive for the quality. I would suggest better bacon, seasoning the fries and having A1 for the burgers and fries. It's in a convenient location for me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I had green chili and hubbies had Calif burgers. Both cooked to our order, medium, which was juicy good. The buns are wonderful and fresh.  The calif had fresh greens.  The zucchini fries and onion rings were also very good.   The wait staff was very responsive and friendly.  We sat on the patio and it was beautiful outside. Nothing I could complain about.  Read some of the poor reviews, and disregarded.  I heard good things from others who had been here. Glad I checked them out.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch menu! Try the Kobe beef its delicious! This is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat. It's got a unique vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Expect to pay $10-12 for a decent burger and fries in a tacky, blue-themed interior in cafeteria-style tables and seats.  The happy hours isn't bad, as it boasts some reasonable and fun appetizers along with $2.50 IPA drafts, among other options.  The service was decent, but not great, and the ambiance as a whole didn't seem to be worth the prices on the dinner menu.  At least, I can think of several better options."}
{"text":"This is a 1 star rating only AND ONLY because they closed the Peoria location. Blu Burger which then became Tru Burger was the BEST place to get the most delicious burger you could ever imagine. But, they chose to close this location and have lost 1 dedicated Tru Burger fan. Back to Island's Burgers for me because my favorite Peoria Tru Burger location has closed. :-("}
{"text":"Good quality burger. Decent service. But I've had better and it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  I believe it's the same menu from when it was Blu Burger Grille.  Servers name was Bo and he was terrific, very friendly and attentive.    I had the Bison burger and it was on point.  They made it medium rare and had quality Apple Wood Bacon.  My kids both had the American Burgers and they enjoyed them.  My girl had the Tuna sandwhich and she said it was great.  Total was $65 which is not bad for a family of 4.  I preferred this place to Red Robin because they have Bison meat.    I would reccommend coming in."}
{"text":"Tru Burger has become a regular for the hubby and I. Great burgers and excellent service! Highly recommend the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this Blu Burger Grille location the other day, so they are a 3.5 to a 4 star rating and nothing \"blue\" about it ; -)   Restaurant ~ as stated in other Yelp reviews, this place is literary \"blue\" everywhere. Even if your not a fan of the blue color, the blueness starts to fade after a while and a few drinks.  It is conveniently located in the Park West Plaza ~ 101hwy & Northern in front of the movie theater.  Service ~ was great. Our server knew their menu well and was able to answer all of our questions.  She was very attentive to our needs and kept our drinks filled.  Food ~ they offer Angus beef  and turkey patties for their standard burgers.  They also have a build your own burger where you can choose grass fed beef and bison as well.  We went with the grass fed beef and the bison burgers.  The meat was cook very well and was mouthwatering delicious.  We chose their onion and white buns for our burgers.  They were a bit too big for the burgers but tasted ok.  They have several choices for burger toppings to choose from.  Your burger comes with fries, but I upgraded my fries to zucchini fries.  Both were unappetizing and needed to be doused in catchup or ranch dressing. Their onion rings and sweet potato fries were not really any better.  Their salad was very fresh and flavorsome.   Side note ~ I love blue cheese on my burgers, but if you order their grass fed beef or bison burgers you may want to skip ordering the blue cheese because it can mute the taste of the beef.  You don't want that beefy goodness to restrained or diminished in any way.   Recommendation ~ give this Blu Burger Grille a try next time your in the area and craving for a tasty burger.  Go for the grass fed beef or the bison, skip the fries and go for a side salad.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was blown away by this place! I've come by this place a few times when going to the movies and always smelled delicious. Tonight after seeing a movie, I decided to try this out with my family and I have to say the food was really good! The meat was delicious and the servings are HUGE! I would defiantly recommend this place to others and come back here. It's so worth it"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of  cheeseburgers, they're my favorite. And right now I've got to say that Blu Burger is my favorite place to go for a good burger. Plus their fries are delicious which is a huge bonus. I've always gotten good service here too. And their lunch menu has killer prices!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers and better food than there used to be. We've had some quality issues here before, but went again for their anniversary special and were pretty impressed. My burger came out as ordered and the toppings were nice and fresh. Overall, I can't complain."}
{"text":"Good burger  Bleu burger is good.  Sweet potato fries are okay  I prefer my fries hot not warm.   Had a glass of water and added doterra peppermint drops and then saw that my glass had lip stains on it. That sucked.   Overall service was ok. But not great just okay.   Overall experience 6/10"}
{"text":"I work in Park west and stopped by tonight.  The girls are sweet and the food is good.  Simple as that."}
{"text":"We were sat by the bathroom and the place smelled horrible when we asked to move they didn't want to move us to someone else's table. We decided to stay for appetizers and drinks and after the 3rd time of \"I'll be right back\" when we wanted to order appteziers we simply asked for the bill and left. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I will give this place 5 stars because it has a variety of food but healthy.  The burgers are excellent and you can \"build your own\".  I love the Cobb salad.  The staff is always attentive and accommodating.  The restaurant even allowed my dog on the patio this summer during and outdoor luncheon with my friends.  I wish we had more places like this where costs minimal compared to quality.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD A MEAL WE DIDN'T LIKE.  (bison and Kobe beef on the menu)"}
{"text":"I love Blu Burger, but I'll admit, I get excited over it mainly because of its location in the West Valley. It's nice to have an upscale burger place nearby. I always get the veggie burger here, and it is actually really good for a veggie burger. Most restaurants serve a run-of-the-mill veggie burger that tastes like its been in the freezer for 10 months waiting for someone to come in and order it. But Blu Burger's are great and very fresh, and unique tasting. It keeps me coming back for more, when I am in the neighborhood. If i had to pick one thing i don't like about this restaurant, it would be the aesthetics. The over-saturation of the color blue is a bit much. I don't really like everything to have a blue tint to it (including my food), but that's just me. For one thing, people look horrible in that kind of lighting too. Wouldn't want to go on a first date here!!! The blue windows need to go. It's a bit much...too harsh. But all in all, great service, great food, and great location. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"We tried their signature Blu Burger and a build your own with the Kobe beef. They were both great and very large. We tried regular fries, zucchini fries and onion rings. The zucchini fries were awesome! The only bummer was there weren't very many. The sides are definitely not for sharing. Another con is that they actually have a split plate charge of $2. That really bothered me. Overall, great service and good food! Next time I am trying a $3.50 milkshake."}
{"text":"I thought I would check back and see how the reviews were going as we tried this place a few months back and our experience was somewhat similar to a previous review indicating disappointment with the vegetarian options. While they credited back the cost of the veggie burger that I indicated I did not like, it was disappointing to get what I am pretty sure was a supermarket gardenburger brand veggie patty, that could not even come close to the outstanding gourmet quality veggie burgers we get at Zinburger or Delux burger, perhaps my expectations were too high. Even though they credited it back on my bill and I did not have to pay for the veggie burger, the owner was a bit rude when I indicated my concern via the website, don't know if he was having a bad day with other complaints as he seemed angry that I posted my complaint so soon and that I did not state they credited back the cost of the burger, or if that is just the norm response, everyone has bad days I guess, so in fairness to them I deleted the previous review. In any event, I see they now have some sort of mushroom burger on the menu that they are calling a \"portobello mush\" according to their on line menu, so in all fairness I may give them another chance, maybe try the other location, and see how that is as a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"The food was excellent the stag was nice it wasn't very busy when we're there. The bathrooms could have been cleaner but over all I would go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a new place to go because we were feeling adventurous and we were so glad we found this place.   It was about 4pm on a Saturday and we walk in as a group of ten and were seated right away. We were served by this super cute and fun server named Corey, I believe. He was very laid back and have us great suggestions on what to get (though I think it'd be difficult to find something on the menu that wasn't absolutely delicious).   We got a ton of appetizers to share and they were all great. The green bean fries were delicious along with onion rings, french fries and sweet potato fries. We also got an order of some amazing potato skins! Then we each got a burger. There were so many options from salmon, to three kinds of beef, to portobello mushrooms! There were all kinds of toppings and condiments too! I especially have to rave about the zucchini fries that I ordered with my burger instead of french fries. PHENOMENAL. Seriously.   Plus, they had a ton of beers on tap which was awesome! A lot of times you go to places advertised as \"bar and grille\" and they don't have a wide variety but everyone got something different! My bill (including 25% tip because of the awesome service) was about $18! Not bad, I'd say!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Make it a date night too because there is a movie theater within walking distance! Love it!"}
{"text":"I really have no complaints about this place other than the time it took for our food to come out, was longer than the people next to us that sat down after we ordered. Anyways, the burgers were amazing. I got the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the habanero burger. I tried some of his burger and I will definitely be getting that burger the next time we go. If you love spicy food, the habanero is where its at. We also started with some zucchini fries before our meal and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back.... They're not as good as they think they are. Tried to pass off canned mushrooms as sautéd mushrooms. The Kobe beef wasn't exactly bad but not as good as Kobe should be. Even my husband's basic BBQ Burger was just\"eh\" :/"}
{"text":"I love the color blue.  So when I walked in, I fell instantly in love with the decor.  We were greet immediately and sat in the tables in the middle of the room.  Review the menus and cool idea, Build Your Own Burger!  Total of 6 steps...  Pretty cool, since I am kind of a picky eater.    I got the angus beef (well, no moo-ing), wheat bun, swiss cheese, and mayo.  There are a ton of other selections to add, but I am a plain jane when burgers come into play.  Got the side of fries.  For a burger that is well, it was still very juicy and tasty.  Not dried and hockey puck style.  I was very happy...  Then...  dessert time...  Got the pizza cookie!    Very good...  The comb of half baked cookie and ice cream with all the good food put me into a food coma...    Our server was great and attentive.  The manager stepped in to help the server during a slight rush of people, he was attentive and funny.  Loved the personal attention we received.    Great food + great service = excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great burger/sandwich place. The food is amazing! They have a variety of meats that you can choose for the burgers, such as bison, turkey, and salmon (to name a few). We started our meal with an order of onion rings. They were cooked just right and my kids devoured them pretty quickly. I had a bison burger on a wheat bun with sweet potato fries. It was so juicy and delicious. As I'm writing this review, my mouth is watering...lol My husband had the pastrami sandwich with fries. On their website they didn't show a kids menu, but they have one. Kids can choose from mac and cheese, burger, chicken strips or grilled cheese.  We love when drinks are included with the kids meal...gotta save money somewhere. The kids meals also come with their choice if fries or Apple sauce.  My kids had macaroni and cheese with fries, a kids hamburger with fries and chicken strips with fries.  The chicken strips looked hand breaded and juicy too. They have a full bar and happy hour every day. The sign outside says new owners. We were not disappointed at all and will definitely be back. The food was fast and super yummy."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my parents. We stumbled upon this restaurant after the one were going to was too busy. Their decor was so nice, very clean. We sat on the patio and loved it. It was nice to see it was dog friendly too. I got the BLT with zucchini, my dad got the green chile turkey burger with zucchini and my mom got the special of Lemon pepper salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. Everything was very tasty. Zucchini was really crisp and tasty. My BLT was really good! My dad loved the spice of the green chile turkey burger. And, my mom liked her salmon sandwich. Service was great from our server Beau! Can't wait to go back with my husband and try the burgers."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and just wanted a good burger. In Southern California where I'm from we have lots of burger bars and they're always competing for business so I just wanted to try this burger bar I sat at the bar and waited 3-4 minutes before anyone even asked \" can I get you a menu\" I said sure and how about a glass of water. Got a menu right away took another two minutes for the water. They asked for my order when the water arrived I said give me a minute. That was a mistake it turned into 5 minutes. Now I've been there for 12 minutes and have not had my order taken. I ordered the Angus burger build your own and fries. I see all these positive reviews talking about yummy hamburgers and I'm thinking maybe I just went there on the wrong day. My burger was mediocre the bun was cold it had been grilled but was not warmed up. Fries were okay definitely not the best not even close McDonald's fries are better. When they brought up the food I had no utensils I ordered side of mayonnaise side of ketchup none of that came out I had no napkin no knife and fork. They finally brought out all my utensils my side of mayo and a bottle of ketchup I've had better burgers at Dennys. I'm pretty sure the meat was frozen and then thawed out or it may have been a pre-made patty definitely was not fresh or hand pressed. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody I'd rather go to Burger King McDonalds In and Out Burger anywhere but here."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 stars simply for the fact that it was the best burger I've ever eaten. Kobe beef, any bun, blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle, a1 sauce. Off the chain!!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area to see a show in the Jobing.com Arena and this particular location was in a shopping plaza near there.  They are on the end corner close to the movie theater and this offers a decent view from both inside and the porch outside.  The ceiling feels endless in here and it's very open. There are several TVs throughout and they are playing a variety of things, but if a game is on, this wouldn't be a bad spot to sit and watch.  We both created our own burgers - I had blue cheese and garlic on mine and he had caramelized onions, ketchup and cheese on his. For sides I went with fries and he opted to get onion rings for $1 more.  Everything was made to order and the burger was a perfect medium as requested.  The fries were good, as were the onion rings - although we debated the extra cost for them, but hey, it's only $1.    Our server was very nice and handled everything quickly and checked back regularly to ensure everything was good.  They had some yummy looking desserts on their menu, but we were pretty full and on a time schedule, so we skipped them this go around.  Overall: A Definitely a good burger stop off and next time we'll know to save room to try dessert!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. Everyone there seemed so nice. I found the burger to be just average. I think I have had way better burgers at other places. Maybe I'll go back and try something else."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch, sitting on the patio. We split an American Burger with thin fries. The burger was perfectly prepared and the fries were great. We also shared an order chips and salsa. These were fantastic. The waitress could not have been any better. Will definitely want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Although today was my first  \"check in\" at Blu Burger, I have been there several times. Today, however, was unlike any other.  Normally when I visit BBG I down a turkey burger with a side of fries and I still somehow manage to shove a pizza cookie down my throat. Today I was lured to try the portobello mushroom burger... I will never eat a turkey burger from BBG again. Aside from all of the delicious condiments that you can choose to put on your burger, the portobello is marinated in a great balsamic dressing, which leaves it absolutely juicy and perfect. I did not even bother to ruin the luscious flavor with other condiments.  Every time I visit BBG the staff is warm and welcoming. They are very fast and your food never takes too long to get to your table. It is a great place to hang out with friends or even go on a date. Needless to say, my \"check in's\" at Blu Burger will continuously grow."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab a burger!  No matter how you want it, this place will grill it up just right.  I was surprised when the bill came that it wasn't as expensive as I expected.  The bar could work on creating some better specialty drinks but other than that, I would go to this place again."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in town!!! Wings are on point and Caesar salad is awesome!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, the burgers are delicious! No complains about the food. My family and I enjoyed every bite. The only thing I had a problem with was the service. It was a little slow at the time, but the service wasn't very good. It took a little for us to get our drinks and not to mention our refills. Also, when we wanted to pay for our meals it took awhile as well. Again, the food was delicious, the service is a little slow, but they are very nice."}
{"text":"I rounded up from 3.5 stars. It was good, but just missed the mark in a few spots.   The selection was great. Overall, it was good. We got a grass-fed and a bison burger. Both were slightly over cooked (which happens when grillers leave them on as long as regular beef). Zucchini fries were very yummy. Onion rings were cooked great. And sweet potato fries were good, but lacking seasoning (debatable, obviously).   Also had a milkshake that was decent, but tasted of chocolate powder rather that syrup. The blue film on the windows makes for blurry viewing. On the upside, our service as fantastic.   All in all, I would go again and would tell my friends to try it. For that, I gave them the round up."}
{"text":"I walked in and thought they forgot to put the lid on a blender full of smurfs... BLUE... EVERYWHERE.....   After I got past the atrocious decor, I ordered Wings mild, a appletini, kobe Burger and Sweet potato fries.   The wings - they only had mild and hot when it came to \"buffalo\" flavors. I ordered mild, but preferred a little more kick. They were really good and juicy.   The martini - ick ick ick too much crown royal.... wouldn't think I would complain about too much alcohol in my drink. I told the waitress and she didn't do anything. didn't offer to replace it or take it off my bill.  The Kobe burger - hmmmm I ordered medium rare and it came out \"gray.\" It tasted ok, but something just wasn't right with the meat. and I was disappointed that it was over cooked.   The sweet potato fries- excellent, but you get a very small amount as a side to you burger.   I would possibly go back and try a different burger."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and it wasn't so busy. There were 2 servers working and it seemed like they were running around all over the place.   Service was really good from the manager.. Seems like he should be getting the tip instead of our server. I ordered a build your own burger and wasn't even finished telling her what I wanted on my burger and she interrupts me asking if I was fries or salad. That was a bit rude.   Then comes the wait for our food... We waited 45 minutes for 2 freaking burgers and fries!!!! For a place that serves only burgers it shouldn't take that long to cook. I got the Kobe burger. When my food finally arrived my top bun was cold and bottom bun was soggy! They first couple bits was pretty good until I got to the middle of the burger and my patty started tasting like raw meat. Eww! And the fries were flavorless.  I don't think the burger was worth $15. I could get a quicker and better burger at Habit burger."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu! Amazing sweet potato fries!! We definatly will be back. Perfect spot to eat before the movies as well."}
{"text":"Pros: Solid burger, huge portion excellent ingredients and taste. Got the breakfast burger which had an egg and bacon...don't cringe it was awesome.  The cons were very long wait...crazy long and the price is expensive."}
{"text":"Nice patio to hang out at happy hour. The happy hour guacamole and chips is outstanding. Great hamburgers and salad."}
{"text":"It's blue, like sad, food is not too good.  They copied Deluxe in Scottsdale, that place is the one to go too.  It busy, tasty, and fun.  This blu burger is not, but the fries are good.  Interior is nice but I think the staff just gots to be more friendly.  I feel like I am the one being judged there, it should not feel like that."}
{"text":"Love Blu Burger. They have one of the best build your own burger selections around. Today I created a bison burger with portobello mushroom caps as my \"bun\", with spinach, grilled onion, goat cheese and chipotle mayo on the side.  They've repainted the wall with a beautiful mural that makes the atmosphere delightful. Staff is always awesome even when the joint is hopping and they will do what it takes to accommodate a request(like mine)."}
{"text":"Very good service, the food was good, the sweet potato fries really hit the spot and the atmosphere is also very inviting. My only peeve was the the decor was a little weird, but I'm not eating the decor so I could handle it. I do go here very often and enjoy it every time"}
{"text":"Great burgers and service. They messed up one of our burgers but fixed it right away and comped it. Burgers were perfectly cooked and the fries pickles are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes the Peoria location has closed. They have RELOCATED to Mid Town Phx  2325 N Central Ave, Phx Opening late Summer Please visit us at our Anthem location until then!!"}
{"text":"Good place they just need uniforms so it's more consistent and people remember the uniforms not just every day clothing they look like the customers just need some uniforms"}
{"text":"Food was good. Liked the build your burger options. My only advice would be not to sit in the back. It REEKED of sulfur and bleach. The \"Employees Only\" door was open and beeping the entire time we ate. I left with a headache from the smell and beeps. But I wasn't hungry anymore. So, there's that."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The overly blue decor did not bug me, as it has some previous reviews, but I will admit the space is lacking a bit. The service was super friendly and attentive, but then again there were only 2 other tables there when we arrived, so a drink never went empty which is always nice.  I love the build your own concept for a burger. I love burgers and it is nice to have creative control. I also really liked that they had sharp cheddar as a cheese option, I really love sharp cheddar on a burger. I went with the standard Angus and the burger was juicy and tender. I asked for medium and I ended up with medium well, but it was still good. The husband went with the Kobe Beef and couldn't pick out a huge difference between his and mine- something to consider if you don't feel like spending $3 more.  My biggest concern are the fries. I went with regular fries, and maybe I am becoming a fry snob, but I wish that they were fresh cut. I knew right off the bat that they were from a freezer bag and while they weren't bad, I would of loved some fresh cut potatoes with a bit of skin- it would of added to the whole experience for me.  Overall tasty burger with a lot of options. I hope they start picking up with business, it is nice to have a good burger place nearby."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I just had a delicious burger because I built it myself. For 10 dollars you can customize your own signature burger and also get a delicious side. I loved their crispy onion rings and tasty zucchini fries!   The service is pretty good and you don't have to wait too long for service. The one thing that makes this place stand out is their amazing manager! He's helpful, courteous and welcoming. I have gone here twice and each time the manager was busting his butt to get food orders out, greet people, and clean tables. I loved  seeing an attentive manager like him. The staff themselves are good too. Thank you for the yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Bison Burger with Zucchini Fries and Turkey Burger with Herb Mayo and reg Fries.  Also had Buffalo Chips.  The burgers were EXCELLENT!!! The Buffalo chips were MEH!  We will definitely be back.  Great burgers, great service, great time!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy stuff! Took my significant other for lunch and the service was speedy, friendly. Will definitely come back. I had a burger that was Hawaiian and he had a bacon egg burger. With zucchini fries on the side. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love being able to build your own burger and eat sweet potato fries! I love all the options available to you while eating and my daughter loves the kids menu too!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Tru Burger Co. before heading to the movies.  It was a Saturday evening, but we got right in.  The restaurant seemed to get busier after we arrived.  There is ample seating inside, as well as an outdoor patio seating with misters and a sign that says \"dog friendly\".    My husband and one daughter had the BBQ burger, which had thick slices of bacon, onion rings, sharp cheddar, and BBQ sauce on them.  I had the California burger, which had an herb mayo, swiss cheese, fresh mixed greens, avocado, and grilled mushrooms.  My other daughter had chicken fingers.  All three burgers were cooked to perfection, huge, and piled high with toppings.  We also had fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries as sides.  Everything was delicious, and I was particularly fond of the sweet potato fries.  They were cut thin and so tasty!  My only request would be that they offer some sort of dipping sauce to go with the sweet potato fries, as I don't enjoy them with ketchup.  Service was prompt and friendly and the prices were good.  The restaurant also offered a bar, with a menu of drink specials, lots of TVs, and was quite clean.  We will definitely be back, next time we go to Park West."}
{"text":"The service is always great with April, the place is always clean, and the burgers are amazing! Try this: Kobe beef, green chile, bleu cheese, buffalo sauce, lettuce, on a wheat bun. It's what I always get and I love it."}
{"text":"Very high quality food at a reasonable price ... bison and kobe beef burgers with ypur own personal picks, who could ask for more"}
{"text":"I  this place great service my favorite MANGO TAANGO Drink! Amazing burger cook Elias Rocks' Server attentive and mgr Christy did a great job on checking on our dining experience!"}
{"text":"Well unfortunately I had to take this place down a star upon our recent visit.  First I want to say our server was really good.  She provided excellent service.  But the food was extremely subpar.  We were craving burgers (hence why we came here) but honestly they were pretty flavorless.  My son's burger was completely burned which he failed to tell me until he'd eaten half of it so I didn't complain.  And as usual, I feel the kids meals are way overpriced.  In fact, at most places, I don't end up buying kids meals because of this.  My kiddos usually split an adult meal.  But the menu here is not that big.  I just really feel they are a ripoff.  Also we were informed our favorite burger was taken off the menu.  So we most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went in for Mother's Day without a reservation.  The manager meet us at the door and was able to seat us right away.  Our waitress was named Stephanie and she was so awesome. She was very friendly and took the time to small talk with us even though they were crazy busy. She provided me with my free Mother's Day mimosa and gave us time to look over the menu.    We did the Mother's Day special and had the bruschetta, green chili burger and the BBQ burger with brownie for desert. The bruschetta was pretty good nothing to special but good.  The green chili burger was decent, the pico de gallo on the burger was a bit too much for me.  The BBQ burger was flippin amazing, I found myself hoping my boyfriend would get full so I could eat some of his (he did share).  The brownie was amazing and warm with warm chocolate drizzle that went amazing with the vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Very quick seating time. We loved the food and it also came out quickly. My only problem was our server was very slow to come around and seemed to be preoccupied with other things."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, decent beer selection and zucchini fries were awesome.  They seemed to be understaffed and the one bathroom working was disgusting. Might have been off night for staff (very busy night)."}
{"text":"Difficult finding a burger place where you do not have to leave feeling guilty with your top button undone OR leave still hungry because you had no choice but to order a small salad with a few fries from someone else's plate. Tru Burger offers gluten free options, and tons of organic choices for your burger that also includes non-hormone fed meat(s) aka happy cows. Salads are also huge and taste very fresh. Leave feeling perfectly full and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was really great! Burger was on point however, maybe it was because we came on Father's Day but the service was really slow!! Zucchini fries were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Lot of hype from other yelpers, very bland show. Went here for lunch and the place was almost empty. Server was nice. We both ordered the beef burgers, mine a custom (wheat bun, medium cooked, provolone, greens, tomatoes, pickles). My wife ordered the American burger. While both were ok, they weren't anything spectacular, which after reading several yelp reviews is what we were expecting. My wife literally said \"I could have had the same thing at Dennys\". Plus, both were cooked to well done (when we had asked for medium), which lead to some of their generic flavourlessness.   The regular fries were the same, and my sweet potato fries would have been better if they weren't heavily coated in large flakes of salt. It made them nearly inedible.   The fried pickles were the only thing we both liked, and even then, the batter was so crunchy and dry and bland. While we were happy they were fried pickle spears  (instead of chips), these only ok guys were the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service. Highly recommended it would definitely come back. Your employees and staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I am not a huge burger fanatic, but this place will be my go to place when I'm craving a big juicy burger. We were looking for somewhere to eat before the Guns n Roses concert and everything at Westgate had a long wait, so we ended up here and I'm glad we did. The service was great and we all loved our food. I built my own burger with jalapeños, green chiles and buffalo sauce and paired it with a side salad. I ate every last bite.  If you are not in the mood for beef, they also have turkey, salmon and veggie burgers as well as a variety of salads and sandwiches. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night...it was delicious, as usual.  But, a little sad, it turns out they're closing this location and opening in Phoenix (near Durant's).  One of the best things about this location, was it's close proximity to us...when we wanted a really great burger, this was our go-to.  I had the Blue Burger, which is my favorite...angus beef, blue cheese and caramelized onions on a brioche bun...with a side of the garlic parmesan fries...so good!!  Hubby got his favorite, the Green Chile Burger with grass-fed beef and a side of onion rings.  Everything was perfect, including the cook on the patties, a juicy medium.  They're closing the doors April 15th, and we just might have to make one more stop here before then.  We will miss you!!!"}
{"text":"I went to TRU Burger  Company on a Friday afternoon during Lunch time and sat at the bar. I wasn't really greeted right away but everyone ended up being very friendly. I ordered a Jalapeño burger with a salad. The burger was really good, super spicy but good and cooked to temperature. The toasted bun was a deal maker and I feel it really made the burger. The salad had fresh mixed baby greens but I had to chop it up quite a bit, since the pieces were a tad too big.  I think I'll come back again soon and have a beer from their vast selection or a Mimosa on a Sunday ($3). I don't have much else to say, I was satisfied and the food was good but nothing blew my socks off.. and for a $12 burger. In this day in age restaurants really need that one special WOW factor in one way or another and I haven't found that yet at TRU."}
{"text":"Its a burger place with a trendy spin on it, its not too sporty or loud.  Their menu is pretty limited and well all they basically have are burgers, but they are good at it.   To me its a much better option than BJ's brewery or Gordon Biersch"}
{"text":"I love this place still!  It's amazing and for they have a delicious portobella burger and some very yummy salads!  Service was once again great, and I'm happy to see some place so consistently good in the west valley that seems to be hard to find out here."}
{"text":"(Shhh, I'm trying to stay awake at work, so writing this review!) Last Saturday, out-of-town friends and I found ourselves in this neck of the woods for the first time to visit the monstrosity that is the sports arenas/shopping malls. (NEVER AGAIN!!!)  Made our first mistake going to a Yelp approved Mexican joint that made us pay a cover charge to enter, that promised they'd have seating inside, but didn't.  We were hungry, so we were happy to find that this place had seating and was not crawling with drunken wrestling fans.  I was particularly thrilled with their milkshakes for $3.50!  My Bison Burger was HUGE (1/2 pounder), but I think I made a mistake and should have built more toppings into it, because it was overall a bit dry.  For you non Beef eaters, they also have salads  Owner and Servers were friendly, and I liked the blue, clean ambiance.  It did it's job well!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I love how they break everything down and you can truly create you own burger down to the meat, the bun, the toppings and the sauce. I've seen this place packed. So be sure to call ahead to see the wait time. Also sign up for the rewards you get 10% off and other great coupons!"}
{"text":"My wife and I where going to the movies and stopped into true burger co. This place was really good. I am a burger guy and I have to say I am stuffed. I ordered the BBQ burger and it didn't disappoint. I highly recommend this place to bring the family."}
{"text":"I love the turkey burgers and skinny fries from this place! It's hard to find some good turkey burgers at restaurants and this place has exactly what I like. The only downside is that they close early 8 PM. And the place is a little on the small side but other than that the service was good and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Been here once and would keep going back. The fried pickles, oh my god. Anytime I see fried pickles on a menu I have to get them and these were gone in a few minutes. My burger was great. Sweet potatoes fries were on point. Server was very nice and attentive. Just overall a great place with nice people."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good other than a hard bun kind of hurts your jaw to chew. Butone thing that WILL NOT bring me back is a employee was putting ointment on his obviously new tattoo where people could see him and HE DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS  so gross just imagine the blood borne pathogens and skin he put on stuff. NEVER AGAIN will I be eating here."}
{"text":"This place is great for grabbing a bite before a movie.  It is literally across from Harkins Park West.   We came on a Friday night.  It wasn't too busy and we were greeted quickly.  We sat out on the patio on a nice cool evening and had an enjoyable time.  They have a great selection of burgers, pretty much anything you want on a burger.  The burgers with fries are over $10 a pop.  Two of us had dinner with tip for about $40.00.  I had a super tasty burger with green chilis, bacon and cheddar cheese.  I got the skinny fries but you can upgrade to sweet potato fries or onion rings.  They also have garlic parmesan fries which I will try next time.    I would eat here again.  Great for date night or chatting it up with friends on the patio.  Check out their menu online for more of their yumminess.  Bonus, the patio is dog-friendly!  Love that!"}
{"text":"Good burgers just a little over priced, did the create your own burger with grilled onions american cheese and thousand island dressing, that's how I like my burger. Service was a little slow and only two waitresses working that night but very friendly, music was little loud and hard to have conversation with others in our party."}
{"text":"Maybe they make great burgers but we can't recommend it for drinks and munchies. The atmosphere combines the sterility of a Formica covered Greek diner with the snootiness of haute cuisine. Our waitress seemed put out by our presence when we stopped in for drinks on a Saturday night. Didn't care for the buffalo chips. Onion rings were fine."}
{"text":"We noticed this place when we were looking for a meal before going to the theater across the street.  We were seated quickly and the server was very friendly and attentive.  The menu was mostly specialty burgers of various meats, toppings and buns.  Pretty neat if you are in the mood for a really well made \"build your own\" burger, or if you want to select one directly from the menu.  We noticed that salads and a few other items besides burgers were available.  Also, there is a full bar and of course many beers available to accompany your meal.  Our waitress was great, she suggested the onion rings, but I didn't really think they were that special.  Overall, it was a great visit."}
{"text":"Very good veggie burger. Waitress wasn't very friendly, but the owner was extremely nice and accommodating. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great, fast and helpful. I ordered a basic cheeseburger with seasoned  fries. The burger wss thick, juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Very tasty and worth the price. I will be back to try more options."}
{"text":"Burger lover's dream! Try the blu burger & sweet potato fries. They also have \"build you own\" burger options and various apps. Their chips & salsa was delish! Great selection of beers on tap including a beer brewed in Flagstaff. Definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"Husband and I both had the build-a-burger. He had the Kobe fries, and was very happy with it.  I had the veggie burger with spinach, egg, and chipotle mayo on a whole wheat bun, with side salad. It was a foodgasm. I've had veggie burgers all over, and this is the only one I really loved besides Morningstar.  It was nicely flavored, had a pleasant texture and was cooked nicely. Most veggie burgers I've had are mushy, dry or both. Blu Burger's was perfect.  I agree with the other poster that the bun is too thick. I ended up slicing some off the top and that worked.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars was the server didn't check back on us after delivering our meal, and the place wasn't busy at all (I saw 2 or 3 servers on duty). Everyone was friendly though.  Cool decor, clean, music at talkable volume."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  We were very pleased with our burgers. We both ordered the parmesan garlic fries and they were ok, next time we'll just get regular.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Service real good and food delivered quickly . Big Kobe beef hamburger and good sweet potato fries ."}
{"text":"If God created a burger better than that of Blu Burger Grille, he must have kept it for himself.   Kobe beef? Bison beef? Even Salmon? These are all fantastic things you can make your burger out of.   The way rad thing is that the whole \"build-your-own\" isn't like any other restaurant. You can build it with ingredients not found at other establishments and you even have quite the assortment of buns to choose from, as well as sauces. I won't go into detail of all the combinations because I am terrible at math (And almost went batty trying to figure out all the drink combos at Sonic).  I would also like to commend the restaurant on their quickness. They were packed due to their inside having some sort of function and our server was still prompt and we got our food in what seemed under ten minutes. I was very surprised.   Also, sweet potato fries? Boy howdy these were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!  We only eat the salads here but the salmon is so yummy...we go here all the time because it is a quiet and quaint place to grab a salmon salad (you can choose from like 5-6) and a glass of wine or beer. I love sitting outside when it cooler. Service is typically decent, only had an issue one time where the owner had to get involved because we ordered takeout and the waitress wrong it up wrong. She couldn't figure out the math unfortunately and it took 4 people and 20 minutes to straighten it out. We have been going for so long without issue, we just decided not to do take out anymore. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place three orders they were great. Burgers had good taste, juicy, and big. But all of us (3 people) ended up with a severe stomach ache, lasted till the next day. Damn, I did not order McDonald's and paid $45 for three burgers. For that reason, I will not be a customer again."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Hormone free high quality beef you can taste. They have every sauce and topping you could ever ask for. We both created our own burgers with kobe beef (worth the extra $1!). I recommend the red pepper mayo. Skinny fries and sweet potato fries crispy perfection. Can't wait to create another burger next time!"}
{"text":"I must say I'm not a big burger person, but this was pretty great!  Appetizer i thought was the highlight.   Home made potato chips with buffalo sauce i think ranch  (which is funny cuz i hate ranch) and blue cheese.   Entrée, i had the make your own burger.   Black Angus medium rare pickles swiss cheese and fresh mozzarella lettuce wrap...   Although it was more one piece of lettuce on top and on bottom so of course it didn't hold very well.   Hubby had the  California burger but changed meat out to Bison medium well.  I had garlic fries for my side and he had onion fries.   He ate all my fries!!  Grrrrr...   =P\"   The lemonade was good not too sweet and not too overly tart.   Over all good experience and good food.   For military fams they do have  Mil.Dis.  =)"}
{"text":"If my rating was strictly based on food, I would rate this place 4-4.5 stars. The burger I had was good but the decor made it difficult to stay and eat. I understand the name of this place is Blu Burger Grille but does everything have to be blue? I wanted to give 4 stars but I really couldn't because the decor made it unsettling. The server (Stephanie I believe her name was) did a nice job and the food tasted great, so if that is all you need to enjoy your dinner, then this place is for you. In my opinion, if they added some other colors to off-set the blue the restaurant would be much more visually appealing and I would return but as it currently stands I don't think I will be returning to dine in."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but food is terrible . Frozen burgers super over cooked and bland fries. I would stop in for a drink but not worth what they charge for burgers"}
{"text":"First time here sense it was Blu burger. Wow it was awesome. I had the special animal burger with onions and thousand island. Wife had the portbello mushroom burger with lots of topping. She said really good. On top of the burgers the sweet potatoes fries I could eat all night. Service good as food. Go support the business."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was good, the bathrooms were disgusting. Informed the server about the restrooms and he did not seem to care. 2 not so happy experiences in a row here. I won't be returning. Not worth the money or the 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that as someone who has come here about every 2 weeks or so for the last year, I think they have one of the best (if not the best) burgers and onion rings in the valley. If I was basing this just on food, it would get a 4.5 or 5 stars.   The customer service, however, that I have been getting recently has been increasingly terrible. Today was the straw that finally broke the camel's back so to speak and I finally had to post about it. To sum it up, when ordering,I asked for habanero sauce on the side of my to-go habanero burger so as to not have a saggy bun when i got home. When I got home, I had received none so I naturally called them up and explained it to the lady that answered the phone. She got the girl that took my order and the first thing she does is to accuse me of not asking for it on the side in a very annoyed tone. This was complete BS as I remembered the exact conversation as the lady interrupted my order initially when I was asking for the habanero sauce on the side. In the end she asked what I wanted her to do. I asked her what they normally do. I was offered the choice to either come back and get it (really?) or get credit for the free sauce next time. Needless to say I hung up laughing/in disbelief.  The whole conversion was very unprofessional. I have worked retail for 10 years and I would have been HORRIFIED if I overheard a fellow coworker acting like she did. This type of service has unfortunately become much more common. This once loyal customer is now starting to try and find a comparable burger place with better service.  Most of the food is AMAZING. However, you are taking a russian roulette-esque chance as far as customer service.  Edit: I don't think the owner endorses this type of behavior, however, more care needs to be taken when hiring employees. I have personally spoken with the owner in the past when his cell phone number was accidentally posted on the web instead of the Blu Burger number and he was a really nice guy that was engaging to talk to in a funny circumstance.  Edit #2: Recieved an apology from both the owner as well as the waitress in question. I gave them another try and they made the same mistake. I spoke with the owner over the phonne who was very apologetic, gave me his personal cell phone number, and refunded the meal this time.   The owner is really amazing I have to say, but they have made errors at a high rate. This has the potential to be a 5-star place if they make less mistakes than I have been witness to.    TBD..."}
{"text":"ambience was nice. Seated right away. Terrible service. Food took about 40 minutes and all we ordered was a salad and a bison burger. The salad was like a whole 16 ounce bag of spinach with 1 clementine orange, cranberries, and a small amount of mozzarella. The bison burger which has an egg on it was somehow dry. Very disappointed. After such a long wait, you would think a manager would come out to apologize or anything for that matter."}
{"text":"Took the family here again, before hitting up the theater.  The service was excellent and our waitress was awesome.   As always, we start off with the fried green bean fries and buffalo chips. Unfortunately, we forgot to ask to hold off on the blue cheese and whatever that white sauce (couldn't remember). Our awesome waitress didn't hesitate to change the dish. After she corrected our mistake, my kids killed those buffalo chips. Those appetizers were delicious.   Then we went ahead and tried out something different. We tried the Philly steak sandwich and I have to say it was very bland. I ordered it without onions and then realized it didn't have the bell peppers. Up was up with that? But to be honest, I don't think it would of helped.  Anyways, I still love this place and will be back. Just going to stick with the habanero burger."}
{"text":"The beer sign attracted us to the restaurant and we had the fish tacos!  AMAZING!  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"The handful of times that I have been here I haven't had a problem at all. There Hot Pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries are too die for!! their fried pickles are delicious too the T ! I have munched of a friends plate to try her fried zucchini and those were great also. My boyfriend had a kobe beef hamburger and regular fries. NO WORDS. Very great food !!!"}
{"text":"Yummy as always!!! Zucchini Fries and Homemade Ranch is the best!! Applewood Bacon is Bomb!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times great food short wait. This time they are  slow in the kitchen... due to a table of 8.... and they were short a cook. The owner put on an apron and got to work...Gordon Ramsey would commend him! The staff kept their cool and when people left before their food came they apologized and said Merry Christmas! I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo glad you guys reopened this place  !!! It's a nice location - great place to grab a bite after work , watch a game or grab a bite before yr movie date !!! YUM !!   Good menu -good choices & I like the atmosphere !! Bad a bing !"}
{"text":"In the Phoenix market there is stiff competition. Trendy burger joints are popular. Blu Burger, while not bad, is no competition.  Let's start with \"American Kobe\" as their 2nd meat option for a B.Y.O.B. There is NO such thing. There are people that will argue against me, but those people fall into 2 categories, those selling, and those that have been suckered into buying.  The fries and onion rings came out of a bag. At this price point I expect fresh.  The bacon on our burgers was great. The wings were pretty good.  Overall, the food is good. There are just too many places that deliver better quality at this price for me to be impressed."}
{"text":"We decided to go here because it was close to the theatre.  I have to say we were thoroughly dissapointed.  The burger was not very hot the bun ws cold the fries were cold.  The server was decent it just wasnt that good of an experience.  If you are lookin for a good burger check out Smash Burger. http://www.yelp.com/biz/smashburger-avondale"}
{"text":"Food was terrific. I had a turkey burger on a gluten free bun and it was super juicy and the bread stayed intact through the whole meal. Sweet potato fries were cooked perfect and an absolute must with the red pepper mayo. My son had the teriyaki burger and it came with not only pineapple and teriyaki sauce but ham too! The server was top notch. Unlike previous Yelpers I did not notice any unpleasant smell nor was I put off by the amount of salt on my fries. The food smelled delicious and the taste did not disappoint. The size of the burger patties was generous and the meat, bun topping ratio was spot on. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre place with a weird cafe feel.. Food was not all we had hoped for.. But the beer was very cold and the AC was on!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Order on Uber Eats all the time and the owner sometimes surprises me with coupons! Great food and great staff. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place serves delicious burgers and the Scottsdale location is small but intimate. They have many varieties and their french fries, toppings, and sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"The food was great! My burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I had a side salad and the balsamic dressing was probably the best I've ever tasted. The wings were great. Moist, crunchy, and the sauce had a nice little kick to it. Our waitress was great. She was very friendly, made great recommendations and most importantly, kept our drinks filled! My only complaint was the decor.  As the name implies, everything was blue. The walls were all blue, every other window was tinted blue, so your food appeared to have a blue tint to it. It was a little off-putting.  They should rethink the blue and just have pops of blue with neutral walls and non-tinted windows. It would make the food more appealing to look at. I still give it 5 stars though!"}
{"text":"In short: uninspiring. The blue decor is completely overwhelming and unappetizing. The meat wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped and the buns were huge--there was way to much bread to create a balanced burger. I judge this establishment against Delux  which I think is the benchmark for burgers in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pricey for good, but average food. Left feeling like I spent too much for what I got. Paid for atmosphere."}
{"text":"The tropical tea is delicious!  Really well cooked burger.  They have bison, angus, Kobe, and more.  Amber was super fun, and never missed a beat in the 7 iced teas I had.    Also, start with the bacon cheese jalapeño fries.  Comes with an aioli that's great.  And, only $5.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed with the limited vegetarian options on the menu. I should have looked before I sat down."}
{"text":"While the food was ok it was just that.  It's hard to make a burger taste bad I mean it's a burger add bacon and cheese and you are good to go.  Blu burger is a new joint in park west over at northern ave on the west side.  The decor is nothing fancy painted blue inside all over and it is pretty basic I thought it would be a little bit more trendy.    The service was absolutly terrible the waitress too ten minutes to ask fir our drinks ten minutes to bring them then she left and ten minutes later she came back for our order after a manager asked if we had put it in.    Food arived quick my burger while tasty wasn't worth 11 bucks I had the blu burger which is the angus half pounder with bacon and grilled onions and cheese.  My side was sweet potatoe fries and they were good but cold.  The waitress never asked if I wanted ranch or hot sauce or anything.    In all I would say for a gourmet burger this isn't your place it's ok at most.  If u want a burger before the movie it may work for you."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The service is superb. They allow doggies within the patio and will provide ice water for your furry friends. I stop by after my morning hikes w/my doggie and have a burger and some type of signature drink they make with Crispin, stout (I think) and ice.  It's such a refreshing drink! I once ordered the salsa and was skeptical.  I thought it wouldn't be good since it's a burger place, not a Mexican restaurant, it was fresh, spicy and delicious!! I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stopped by there in our way back from Las Vegas and the food was really good. I was kind of scared to try it cause ive never heard if the place but very glad I did. Burgers are huge and definately enough to share. Sweet potate fries were good butnot anything special. I would definately go again!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last night and ordered the BBQ whisky burger, lettuce wrapped with zucchini fries. The burger was pretty good, as were the zucchini fries. The ranch they gave with the zucchini was so watery that it wouldn't stick to the fries at all, it just ran off. Overall the meal was good, though a bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"As someone who visits Phoenix multiple times a year I'm always on the lookout for a place I'm willing to eat. I generally gravitate towards the local / mom and pop places but in Phoenix I've had very little luck. Was happy I looked into Tru Burger. If you're hoping for a quality hamburger place you have found it! A choice of patties including grass-fed, a choice of buns including lettuce wrap, and a choice of sauces. If you're into the heat try the habanero sauce, I loved it! If you aren't into the heat, definitely avoid it. There was a choice of sides including a fresh side salad, sweet potato fries, something called Skinny Fries. There were other things on the menu. But I was not focused on them. The lettuce wrapped grass-fed with the jalapeno sauce and extra tomatoes was outstanding! But I'm sure whatever combination you choose will hit your spot as well. I'm already looking forward to the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The best burger place on the west side.  Food is awesome, tried the angus burger, french fries, zucchini fries (they are the best I've had in Az), onion rings, and Friday fish special, it was all bomb!  Service was great, our waitress  Bree was great and even the busser and other waitresses brought stuff out.  TV'S are spread out all over.  Great atmosphere, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The caprese salad with chicken is my favorite salad ever. The customer service was poor when I was there last weekend. We had 3 servers stare at us for almost 15 minutes before they helped us. It looked like they wanted to go home and we were the last table. I looked like they were making a bet who would get stuck with the last table even though they didn't close for another hour."}
{"text":"Worst manager Desire is passive aggressive, and has no formal restaurant or people skills. I will literally tell everyone I know not to eat there. I wonder if the owner knows what is running his business?? Into the ground? Can't believe they are still open"}
{"text":"Tried this burger place for the first time after seeing the good reviews! I was not disappointed!! I ordered the special which was a guacamole burger! It was full of amazing flavor! The service was top notch! I might add that the sweet potato fries were quite possibly some of the best I've had! Seemed a bit on the pricey side for lunch since you have to leave a tip as well but I suppose thats getting to be the new normal!"}
{"text":"I love the small, friendly atmosphere.  Amber was great from the start and made the experience the best!  We will be back as often as we can.  The Bison burger is fabulous and worth every bite of it.  So sorry we didnt walk in after a movie before now."}
{"text":"Going to update my review after actually trying this place, owner was nice enough to contact me after my first review =]  ......  Was going to try this place for the first time but apparently they close early if there not busy yelp says their open till 9 got here at 8:15 and it's closed with only one group inside =/"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced.  French fries came cold.  Took over 1/2 hour to get two hamburgers and they were not busy."}
{"text":"Went by for the Saturday farmers market and noticed an ad saying new owners, the Chinese chicken salad was very good with sunflower seeds and citrus vinaigrette. Had the  roasted green chili burger with cheddar , chipotle mayo, and crudo, had nice heat ,the brioche bun was good sweet potato fries were good but came out tepid."}
{"text":"Love the good. The build your own options are amazing!! And the server Amber was fantastic. I will definitely be coming back. I am a burger junkie and this place is the best."}
{"text":"Love this place for many reasons:  1. you can get any kind of \"meat\" you want 2. you can put everything but the kitchen sink on it 3. sweet potato fries! They have great burgers, yummy fries and the best dirty martini I've had in a long time!   Is it gourmet? Nope. But I've also been to Deluxe, and wasn't impressed. BlueBurger is a great burger joint."}
{"text":"I got the jalapeño burger and my goodness it was great! Between the crispy fried jalapeño and the sweet jalapeño aioli my mouth was watering! Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is decent.. Nothing special here.  Seems like a cheap ripoff ZinBurger."}
{"text":"Came here after today's Fiesta Bowl at the Univ of Phoenix stadium, which is very close by. (Too bad ND lost. Oh well.) We waited about 10 minutes for a table. The greeter did say that they got busy all of a sudden (because the game just ended likely), so he warned us the kitchen was a little backed up. But after we ordered I didn't notice until the burgers came out shortly after our appetizer. But it wasn't a problem at all. Our service for the meal was attentive and friendly. It was busy but we were never without refills.   The food was casual and very good. We ordered two burgers, one kid's burger and two sandwiches. Everything looked and tasted great!! The size of the sandwiches and burgers were giant and they came with your choice of side. The kid's burger came plain with cheese and was large as well.  I will say that the women's restroom was dirty and gross. The garbage can was overflowing. The floor was icky. I don't even want to talk about the toilet.   Overall, this is a great casual restaurant with delicious food."}
{"text":"Decently priced, great-tasting burgers. The fries are also fantastic, as are the chips and salsa. My fiance really likes their wings as well. The service is good, and the staff is always friendly. We have never waited more than a few minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Best burger around these parts.  I had a turkey burger that was moist and flavorful, not easy to do with turkey.  I really like how you pick everything on your burger from the bun to condiments, some of the choices are interesting and tasty (raw jalapenos-hot!).    Onion rings were not greasy, but had tons of taste-didn't even need ranch or something to dip them in.  My dining guest had the veggie sandwich that was also near perfection, maybe just a touch too much oil on the veggies.    Only problem for this place is that the center is dead.  6 PM on a Friday and the place was not even 25% capacity.  I hope it makes it as this is a great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Kobe burger was great with zuchini fries...cold beer...only complaints is the mens room needs some serious help lol...always good burgers here!!"}
{"text":"1st time eating here and the last. You can get a better burger at jack in the box. The burgers had an after taste like burnt char... taste like the grill and had no other flavor.   Best tip don't waste your time and $ dont go there.. not that great!"}
{"text":"There was a point where I was considering giving up on Blu Burger. Apparently when they first opened, the place was quite upscale and pricey. My aunt told me that you could get some really high end burgers here but to expect to spend $20-30 per person.  If that is the case, we never went when it was like that. The current menu has been in place for a few years and I'm a fan of that. I will say that the American Kobe (which is a pet peeve. Kobe is from Kobe, Japan! The breed of cow is wagyu. I wish restaurants would call it wagyu!) was good but I didn't find it worth the increased price. The selection of toppings is great but some of the upgrades do cost extra. I personally wish caramelized didn't cost extra but that's not a huge deal. The fries and onion rings are both great. The sweet potato fries are not bad. For a while all of these sides were pretty bad. Everything tasted mushy. I have not tried the fried zucchini since the last time I ordered it. But that was back when I was thinking this place had gone downhill.  My last 2 visits were far better. I'm not a fan of the 50s decor but the food has gotten back to the point I remember when we first started going. My favorite burger is med rare. I like goat cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, and whatever aioli strikes my fancy that day."}
{"text":"Nice, spacy good looking place. Inside and outside seating with a full bar.  I almost never get chicken sandwiches but I did today and it was great, the chicken was moist.  Our server Desiree was very kind and refilled our non alcohilic drinks often with a smile.   Worth a shot for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Blu Burger for the first time last week... enjoyed the food but felt it was a bit overpriced. I would go again but only if I was nearby. Other burger places that are just as good but not so spendy."}
{"text":"I got the BLT and it was good. Greasy and when you took a bite all the bacon came out. Just to break it up and reassemble it. Good though. Had a bite of my gf's burger. SO good! The meat had a great flavor to it and the green chilli was on point! We will def be back for more. Staff was awesome."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! We brought our dogs with us and sat on the patio. Fast, friendly service and they accommodated us to move a heater closer to our table because it was cold outside that day. I ordered a custom-built burger and loved it! Deliciously juicy & packed with flavor. They brought out water for our dogs too. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is because the bathroom and 20 feet outside of the bathroom smelled like fresh, raw sewage. It was such a strong smell and no one mentioned a word about it. I'm not sure if it's normally like that or if I happened to come on a day when a pipe broke. I would definitely return here and sit on the patio again though :)"}
{"text":"Decent burgers.  Ok patio for our fur babies.  Very talkative server.  Little too much for our liking."}
{"text":"Good food, good staff. Grabbed a bite before a movie and have no complaints. Really liked the zucchini fries!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My husband did some work for them not to long ago and told me to stop in some time. So I did with my 3 sister's. And we all thought it was amazing food and staff was so kind. We all got a little bit of everything. We had the chips and salsa. And that was amazing. The chips are warm and so tasty, we all had different burgers and amazing, sweet potato fries wow great, onion rings again wow, last the zucchini fries in love with them. Great place I would tell anyone I know to try this place out.    Rusk Family"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing and have great fries. Offered a gluten free bun that was the best I've ever had!  I had the green chili pepper burger, and would highly recommend you try it. Just the right amount if spice. The waitress was super nice and helpful too"}
{"text":"Cheap happy hour specials 3 and 4 dollar plates. Typical bar food except somehow the Buffalo Chips were slightly addicting. They sounded gross but I could not stop eating them. Homemade chips, hot sauce, and mild blue cheese. For my meal I got the Kolbe Burger which was delicious."}
{"text":"Not so good.   The burger tasted like it was BBQd on a grill of charcoal that was lit with starter fluid.  The onion rings were not good at all. The fries were cold.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review as I enjoy writing good reviews. This review is not meant to be mean or bash a place. Hopefully the management will read this and make the corrections necessary.  We started going to Blu Burger several years ago and had had good service. The food was reasonably priced and service good. At that time I gave them 4 stars. Then they changed their name to Tru Burger. The menu changes but the food was still reasonably priced and the service was good.  Tonight we ate there again. There was a sign that said under new management and a new attitude. I may of not quoted this exactly correct but this is close to what it said.  I ordered the cobb salad. I asked for blue cheese dressing on the side. After a 45 minute wait our food arrived. The blue cheese that was supposed to be in the salad was on the side and I had zero salad dressing. I asked  for blue cheese dressing and got two tablespoons of blue cheese dressing in a small cup with the promise he would open a new bottle and bring more. I waited and when none came someone else come over and asked if I needed something. I asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The two was brought to the table each with less than a tablespoon in each. I was told they were out and also had no more blue cheese dressing. By now I had eaten most of the salad. I was brought two more dressings I did not like and did not use. I was then brought olive oil and balsamic vinegar from the kitchen. By this time I only had two bites left. We also had another order that was wrong and had to be remade.  I hope they can get their act together. I will give them another chance because of the location and the good service we have gotten there before."}
{"text":"lousy food.. expensive terrible business. 100.00 bill for 3 burgers and a salad plus drinks. not sure how they stay in business.. will never go back and tell everyone i kniw about the crappy food and terrible pricing. everything costs extra .. even bacon"}
