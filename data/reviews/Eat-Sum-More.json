{"text":"The food here is never fresh. Everything is almost expired and not fresh. For example, the candy is always rock hard, and the tea bags always taste stale when you make them. It also doesn't help how rude the owner is. I also had an experience where I went in to buy a drink concentrate after a friend told me that this store carries it, the owner lied to my face and told me that they never sold it, but they do sell the drink prepared in cans, which costs a ton more. So I left, after she pushed me to buy the more expensive one. I then told my friend they the owner told me that they don't carry it. So she told me where in the store it is. So I went back to the store and went straight to where she told me it was, lo and behold, it was there! Then when I went to pay the owner said something like \"ohhh so is that what you were looking for?\" They lied to make me purchase a more expensive product. I now go the the other side of town to the other South African store, they are much more deserving of business."}

{"text":"This is a South African butcher and specialty shop.  My buddy notes that the store is \"so South African it's scary.\"  I hunted down this shop for him (he's from Capetown) who was feeling a bit homesick for biltong (meat that's cured a particular way).  His particular preference is for wet (vs dry) and lean (vs fatty) sliced biltong.  Pronouncing it \"very good\" my buddy ended up leaving the store a happy man.    The women who run the shop were very friendly and also gave us samples of a few types of jerky while chatting up my friend about the politics of home.  All the jerky and biltong is made in house - and according to the owner, with Canadian beef but with spices from South Africa.  The one woman who started the store in 2003 said her family also had butcher shops in South Africa.  In addition to the jerky and biltong, the store also stocks all types of sauces, condiments, crackers, drinks and other miscellaneous products form South Africa including (to the great delight of my friend) Red Grapetizer (a drink).    I can't say that I have much of a reference point, but the jerky was pretty good and I liked the biltong - which is like ham but a bit chewier and with a bit of a deeper flavor (sorry if that's a blasphemous description to biltong aficionados).  At a cost of $58/kg, we picked up half a kilo (which, according to my friend isn't that different than what it might cost in South Africa).  I'll definitely be back if not on my own, definitely with my friend - which, given its location relative to the painful drive from downtown is saying something."}
{"text":"Great price great food. Best biltong in the city. Freshly made out their own store I can go back every time for more."}
{"text":"Its good and they carry what I am looking for.  They have all the SA goodies.  Jams, chocolates, \"biscuits\" (cookies).  Don't care for the boerewors there - its better at Florence Meats.  They carry most everything that reminds me of childhood."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience from true South African Culture. Wonderful meats and fantastic service."}
