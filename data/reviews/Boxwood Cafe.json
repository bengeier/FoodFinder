{"text":"So cute! I wish there were more places like this in Calgary. My BF and I went on a cold, snowy afternoon and it was so cozy inside. I had the chickpea fritter sandwich (delicious) and french press coffee (also very good). My only complaint is that I wish there were more vegetarian meal options on the menu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant in the middle of Central Memorial Park has great atmosphere and really good food. The only sort-of complaint I have is that the wi-fi signal is weak and will be intermittent on the patio. Other than that, I've been here 3 times and I've never left unsatisfied. The atmosphere is great at night when they light up the fountains and they string a bunch of lights around their patio."}
{"text":"I came back for a work function. We were served a dry chicken sandwich, fridge-cold hummus and veggies, and a vegetable miso soup that would have been tasty if they'd just served the broth and not accompanied it with chunky carrots and leeks.  I wasn't surprised that I didn't like the food, but what did surprise me was to see a staff member accidentally break the top off of a bottle of Pimm's, and then rather than throw it away, poured it into an old wine bottle! So if you want your Pimm's loaded with invisible pieces of glass, come down to Boxwood!"}
{"text":"Boxwood has become a favourite for my husband and I. We both grew up on farms and have robust appreciation for a proper \"home-cooked\" meal. What Boxwood provides is a home-cooked meal on steroids.  My \"usual\" is the pork rack with apricot, apple and tarragon gastrique. I've heard some people comment that it is a bit too fatty for their liking, but they clearly don't have the same appreciation for the pig as as I do. I have an insatiable thirst for pork fat and enjoy every morsel of this divine creation. I can't even pretend to be a lady.  (Honourable mention goes to the roast chicken; it's good, just can't sway my devotion to the succulent pork.)  My preferred sides are the broccolini with lemon and the roasted potatoes, although I have never been disappointed with any of the choices. If you're hungry enough for a starter, the red lentil hummus is pretty damn good too. And if you crave something sweet, the saskatoon berry bread pudding will hit the spot.  Although the food is the silver bullet, there's a lot to be said for the atmosphere. A lot of Boxwood's charm comes from its small size. I love sitting at the bar and watching them create magic. The decor is perfect - rustic and cozy and it's just loud enough to create an energetic environment. The staff is casual and friendly, and are awesome about answering questions about the menu. Boxwood is perfect for a laid-back evening - make sure you take the time to properly savour their food.  *Note, this place doesn't take reservations and is starting to get busy. You may have to wait, especially in the evening, but I promise you that it will be worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I made the trip downtown to go to Native Tongue for an anniversary dinner, sadly they were closed for a staff function - so we took a walk and came across Boxwood.  It has a nice location and friendly staff; their food is of course fresh - however I was under- impressed by their food.  My husband and I got a starter and the pork shoulder for our entree and both dishes I felt we could have easily made at home; I chose a $7 brownie to go, and I expected a very good brownie, instead I received a little square brownie that was nothing special at all.  With all of the fantastic restaurants in downtown Calgary, we will not choosing Boxwood in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, the food was great!  Was there for Big Taste 2016, and had lentil soup (which was just ok), followed by a trout dish with gnocchi that was incredible, and a smore bread pudding dessert that was equally delicious! My one beef was that space is definitely at a premium, and so our wait was a while for our table.  I wish there was simply more space!"}
{"text":"I have visited this, 'what feels like \"a window into the park\", cosy neighbor cafe a number of times. The food is very fresh, 'local sourced ingredients, and they are the young sibling of the River Cafe on Princess Island Park. I like the Boxwood as it's casual, moderately priced, 'my food has always been creative, yummy, 'the staff are young & hip, and it always has a seat available. It feels very comfortable if you're hungry for great food and dining alone. The cafe has a decent selection of wines by the glass, 'again at a reasonable price and make sure you leave room for desert. The Boxwood is also right across the street for \"Shelf Life Books\" which is a very cool bookstore so the two work well together if you're having a personal \"art afternoon\" on your own or w. someone else. 4th Street SW nearby has other cool shopping so this is the perfect resting stop before or after your outing."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I could not believe how many things went wrong, such a disappointment. 6 of us went to celebrate a birthday and I was extremely disappointed. They had no highchairs for our kids (which isn't a dealbreaker except they were so rude about it) and would not accommodate our request to sit inside (the place was empty). They were out of many of their menu items. The waitress was impatient and annoyed when we asked for clarification on the menu. She told us the main courses were just meat and we'd have to pay extra for sides, which we did, and then when our food came it had substantial sides served with it already so she pretty much lied to us to up her bill. We ordered a pitcher of Dark & Stormy's - it was watery and tasteless. My lamb was dry and tough. The salad had no flavor. We asked for them to put a candle (1 tiny candle) in my sister's dessert because we were celebrating her birthday and the waitress came up with excuse after excuse why she couldn't do it (the filling was too mushy it would sink, the crumble on top was too hard to get the candle in) and finally I came up with some suggestions (stick in a piece of dough, fruit, chocolate cake, anything!) and finally she did.  So disappointing because it's scenic & it was a beautiful day. My measure of a good restaurant is whether I could cook the food better myself and I definitely can cook better than what was served here and I am only an \"okay\" cook and definitely no gourmet chef!"}
{"text":"The setting is the best part. The food was just ok, and a tad expensive. The service was nice. The most remarkable thing to note was that the managers/owners were sitting off to the side - poorly dressed, eating and drinking - way too casual-like. Their dishes etc were spread all over the place. They were not representing their restaurant in a professional way or making a polished impression."}
{"text":"Boxwood has a cool location in the Memorial Park, near the Library. It , like many newer calgary restaurants, use local product. I cant say there is loads of seating, and a majority of it is communal. The food is delicious, great for dinner (warning, they dont serve sides, you have to buy them separately) but I found even better for lunch, as the prices are very affordable then. I wouldnt recommend going in with a large group, but would be really cool for a date, or catching up with a friend. Try the home made ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little spot in the park, wonderful space well designed with skylights and long wood tables and a great patio. Their seasonal inspired menu is amazing and then.... you try to order. Most of the menu was out by lunch today, they are missing orders from farms and vendors and understandably its spring, BUT have a backup! Its common sense.  People were extremely friendly and apologetic and I'm always happy to change orders with seasons. Although, $12 for a salad a bit bigger than a side order (Anywhere else), adding chick pea frites for $6 for three small bites WTF!?!?  This place could be so amazing, the food is great but they have a lot to work on. Go if you're unsure of what you want to eat tonight and you're bringing a date because it is a nice spot."}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch at the Boxwood for my birthday.  After waiting approximately half an hour, a nearby table became available.  The server cleared it and then waved over two young men that had just walked through the door, then he over his shoulder he told us we could sit at the bar.  We couldn't beleive it!  There were 3 of us, and only one empty bar stool, never mind all the time we had put into waiting.  We said we would prefer the table and thankfully the customers had better manners than the server and agreed to sit at the bar.   We shared the lentil hoummus, which was served with a pool of oil in the middle.  I had the chicken sandwich and it was tasty.  The food was OK but I won't return or recommend this restarant based on the server's behaviour.   I guess they have all the customers they need and don't need to welcome any new ones."}
{"text":"If you can get into Boxwood at lunch and have an expense account then off you go.  The common table and row seating is cozy if you don't mind sitting next to strangers.  The food is tasty and healthy however the prices are way too high.  I appreciate that organic is not always a cost saver but local is.  A $20 bowl of soup in a bowl that is not even close to a cup is a bit of a rip off and don't expect a side of anything let alone a cracker.  I commend them for being local and being fresh but the price still cannot be justified for the portions they serve you.  We all know how inexpensive a great staple like the chick pea can be but the cost for the wee little portion of chick pea stew was shocking and the soup wasn't $20 worth of goodness."}
{"text":"I love Boxwood. I got hooked over the summer with their beet salad, and I keep on coming back! It help that it is right down the street from me and always delicious. I typically always go for whatever is on special. Today we had their feature carrot salad which was served on greens with garlic and honey mustard vinaigrette and it was delicious! Their hummus and lemonade is also always a must.  One of my go to favorites. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place . For the value the food is fantastic. Anything made fresh from local ingredients in a cozy little space should be praised. I've tried many of their dishes and drinks - enjoyed all of them including their bottled filtered water !!!  If you want some rustic simple food for a quick bite check this place out!"}
{"text":"My brother is a chef and I'm just a guy who likes good food.  Based on my wifes recommendation, the two of us decided to try lunch there a week ago.    My brother and I split the lentil salad and a chick pea tomato stew.  both were good but I really enjoyed the chick pea tomato stew.  For our main meal we both ordered the Porchetta sandwich which was amazing.  The breads are baked right on site and are a great touch to their homemade porchetta.    We both had a pint of Black Pilsner from the local Brew Bros which is a must try.   It's a great simple but good real food lunch spot that I'm definitely going back to.  They do serve dinner, but I don't know much about it."}
{"text":"BIG TASTE 2016  Last day of big taste & boxwood's menu looked promising so we stopped in here for lunch. Literally stood in the teeny entranceway with maybe 4 other parties & was not addressed to by anyone for over 20 min. Is there a list? How long's the wait? It was as if we were invisible. It's a Sunday, maybe they were short staffed, who knows, but how long does it take really to just stop by & say \"sorry, I'll be with you in a moment\"??   FINALLY SEATED, looked around, empty tables everywhere, why it took so long is beyond me. We sat at the bar & finally placed our order - not even gona bother with menu details. Our sandwiches barely had any meat in them. Thought this was normal, but then saw more orders come out after ours that were CONSIDERABLY larger. Guessing they started to run out of ingredients while they were waiting for the rotisserie to finish cooking the meat, & decided it would be okay to just provide rationed portions of their food. Wtf??   We decided to be picky & chose to wait for the oatmeal cookie to bake - she forgot about us & we ended up having them to go because we needed to get back.   The space itself is great - lots of sunlight, patio in the summer, cute bar to sit at with an open kitchen. Oh wait not that last part because you can watch them prepare the food & the girl stuck her finger into the ice cream because she couldn't get it off the scooper omg did you wash your hands after handling meat no you didn't you wiped them on that dirty dish towel yeah i saw you. Also why you wearing one glove & touching everything with the hand that's not gloved.   If you don't mind what happened in the above paragraph, then probably visit this place on a weekday when they aren't swamped because they cannot handle a crowd. At all."}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The bread was fresh from the oven. The free range chicken was moist and well seasoned. The roast beef sandwich was delicious too, tender slices of well seasoned meat - still a little pink.  Warm beet salad was to die for. Homemade Ginger Ale was a treat.  Great location with alfresco dining in a beautiful public garden allows you to escape the city at lunch."}
{"text":"I went for a lovely lunch with my friend at the new Boxwood Cafe located in the recently revamped Central Memorial Park in Calgary.  I have been awaiting the launch of this new restaurant for nearly a year now since the structure started going up and I heard news that it was owned by the same people of Princes Island Park's River Cafe.  I think there is something particularly sweet about lunching or dining in a park so I couldn't resist suggesting it when we made plans for lunch.  It just opened last week so I was eager to be one of the first to sample their lunch menu.  I arrived a bit early and got a chance to fully absorb the space.  Beautiful wood walls and beams, natural light shining in through the building-length skylight, and artfully picked chairs, tables, artwork, and print material.  Even their signage has a gorgeous hand-tooled woodsy feel to it that kind of just makes it feel like home.  Once my friend arrived, we looked over their delicious-looking menu and chose our selections.  Boxwood is completely cafe-style, where you order at the front counter next to the open kitchen and they will bring out your order to your table.  She ordered the Chickpea Fritters and Roasted Eggplant Sandwich ($10) on fresh ciabatta bread with an organic lemonade.  I ordered one of their great salads which had B.C. nectarines, arugala, and feta.  As a side, I thought I would try the Warm Creamy Cornmeal with Aged Sylvan Star Gouda ($6) and a delicious french-pressed coffee.  The salad was great with the nectarines, though on such a cold day I could have gone for something a bit heartier.  While the cornmeal was delicious, I don't think I would order it again as it was a little too rich and sticky for my tasting.  You never know until you try. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her sandwich and I was supremely jealous that they didn't have gluten free bread so I could give it a whirl.  The service at Boxwood was top-notch.  All of the servers were very friendly and helpful when explaining the menu and how to order.  I was  immediately greeted by the friendly chef when I entered the kitchen which was a nice surprise!  You sure don't see that too often in the restarant biz.  I can't wait to go back here for a romantic dinner with my husband followed by a walk through the park.  Have you seen the coloured fountain lights at night yet?  It is perfect."}
{"text":"On Friday Oct 1 I had the opportunity to visit  Boxwood Cafe,(which has recently opened up near my office). It is a wonderful spot right in the renovated Memorial park and on such a lovely fall day I figured this would be a great choice!   Arrived after the lunch rush (around 1pm) & found a nice spot in the corner and headed up to the counter to place our order   RED LENTIL HUMMUS, spiced crackers to share and the roasted Porchetta sandwich for me and chickpea stew and a small green salad featuring blue cheese for my guest.   The meal arrived at our table promptly and we tucked into our meals thats when things started to go downhill. The Red Lentil Hummus we ordered as a starter lacked any flavour at all and had a paste like consistency. The lump of roasted garlic on the side looked nice but it was cold and unappetising and didn't really add much flavour to the hummus  My friend commented that her salad was also surprisingly bland and tasteless given the sharp flavour one expects when the recipe calls for chunks of blue cheese. For her the Soup saved the day it was rich and filling!   My experience was soon to go from bad to worse as I bit into my warm roast pork sandwich only to discover that several of the meat slices inside the ciabatta bun contained slow roasted chunks of pork rind cooked to a rock like consistency and hidden inside the bread! Just to be clear this was not pork 'crackle' this was rock 'chew toy' pork skin!  My tongue reacted almost immediately to the large hole that been cracked into my right molar and as I spit out what had been my tooth along with the guilty rock hard pork rind I knew this was not going to be a meal I would want to repeat. Although I notified the waiter of the problem his response was to nod an acknowledgement and sheepishly walk away with the offending plate! That was it, no apology nothing!   My emergency visit to the dentist the following day was almost as much fun!   Thanks but no thanks I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone for 2 reasons 1. the parts of the meal we ate were overwhelmingly bland and flavourless 2. while I can love to roast pork with the all the rind fat on to keep in the rich flavour it strikes me that common sense would be to remove the rock hard rind when you put the meat into a sandwich unless the chef intends all the patrons need to open and rummage through their sandwich befor eating it."}
{"text":"Loved it when it first opened.  Getting a little disappointed each time I go now.  They used to have an awesome Saskatoon ice cream sandwich but I think they took it off.  At one point it was replaced with a cheaper alternative.  I'm guessing the original chef isn't there anymore???"}
{"text":"Went with a big group of guys. Food was mostly good. Setting is unbeatable. Porchetta sandwich and kale salad were to die for. Chicken sandwich was okay. Lemon lentil soup tasted overwhelmingly of something unpleasant that was neither lemon nor lentil. Disappointed to find they recently switched from Phil and Sebastian coffee to cheaper and lower quality Fratello coffee. Service was great."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city! Consistently great food and service, very romantic and chic atmosphere, and great for summer days where it's nice enough to eat on the patio."}
{"text":"Three of us came for dinner on a Saturday night.   The Boxwood could be summed up as, decent food with bite sized portions and high prices.  The steelhead trout was well seasoned and cooked moist but prepared quite simply; salt and pepper. The polenta was flavourful and well done but it was literally two tablespoon sized dollops. And the corn salsa wasn't salsa at all. It was seasoned corn nibblets.  The starch component of any meal is always the 'value' portion of the meal. It's the filler. For $19 I can live with a 5-6oz piece of fish but the two tablespoons of polenta is unacceptable. The vegetable portions are not portions but a garnish. Again, a dollop of corn nibblets. Very pricey for what you get.  My companions felt the same about their meals. What was presented was decent quality food but certainly not enough. We all left hungry after a $100 check."}
{"text":"I have to update my review of Boxwood from a 4 to a 5 because of the nuts.  According to my friend Bill, \"these nuts are so good, they should be illegal.\" I totally agree. The spiced, citrus, rosemary nuts at Boxwood are delicious.  Also wonderful is the seared tuna with citrus & fennel salad, the warm curried lentils, the strawberry rhubarb coffee cake with caramel salted ice cream, the lamb with mint & salsa verde and (yes) even the bread and butter is lovely.  After we eat all these things Bill says, \"seriously, who invents this stuff?!?!\" The genious chefs at Boxwood Bill, and I love them too.  Boxwood is my new best friend. You will wait awhile to get onto the patio on a hot day because both the food and the location make this restaurant a place you want to sit and enjoy for as long as you can; but it's worth the wait, even if you just get the nuts.  T."}
{"text":"A nice hit for small plates or bowls of something I want, without getting tempted into a full meal I don't need. Super friendly staff. I love the idea of local foods."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcome service !!!!  The food and dessert is tasty.  Next to Central Park what a great place"}
{"text":"The Boxwood had its pros and cons.   I appreciate the opportunity to buy some local, sustainable, organic food in a city where we may have trouble finding this on a regular basis.  The atmosphere is cute here, the location on the newly renovated park is great over dinner and the service that we received was good.  The Cons were that the food was a bit bland. The rotisserie chicken was tasty but the roasted potatoes on the side were meh. The beets were something I could easily prepare in 2 minutes myself.  $70. for 2 people was a bit off of my chart for the mostly flavorless foods, and that was without wine.  Try it out, see if you like it. I will probably go back for one more time to see if the food has been spiced up a bit."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try the Boxwood, it is in such a beautiful location. I was in the neighborhood and so decided to have lunch there. I ordered the Lemon Lentil Spinach Soup. It arrived barely warm and it was thick like a lentil porridge and had an unpleasant bitter taste. My time was limited and I was turned off so after a few spoonfuls I paid and left. There is no excuse for serving something this awful. I am too put off to go back and try again. It is too bad, my hopes were high. The service was fine other then that they did not ask me how my food was."}
{"text":"Great space, especially on a summer evening. Service was pretty attentive and super polite. The fish I had was nicely cooked and seasoned (steelhead trout).  Love that everything is local and made in a small but open kitchen.  Pretty good wine, very nice dessert. Overall a very good meal."}
{"text":"Over rated!  The location is neat, but there's nothing special about this place except for the location.  Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. But it has really gone downhill in the last couple years. I was there a month ago and ordered the lentil soup and a side of bread (really, the bread cost me 4$?? What other restaurant charges for bread w soup?). The lentil soup was barely edible. I actually think it was literally the worst item I have ever had at any restaurant. I give it two stars bcs the waitress was very friendly and did a good job. Also, I really love the location of the restaurant. That's about it."}
{"text":"This is a very nice location. The food boasts local and organic ingredients. I had the soup of the day, which was nice. No complaints, and at the same time, nothing I had I can say is worth recommending.   Their service was very nice. The company was great, which makes this worth remembering."}
{"text":"Well I can say that's Boxwood is one of those places that was a 'debut and a finale' at the same time. That is, I won't be going back there again. Too bad, because the location and the view of Memorial Park is nice.  Anyway, the staff was friendly, but very unprofessional. My husband and I had eaten somewhere else and wanted just a coffee and dessert on the outside patio. They brought me cream that was spoiled. It curdled the minute I poured it into the coffee. Strike one. Next thing I got a cup with lipstick on it. The pretty waitress told me that it can be wiped off . I did not know what to answer to that . YUCK :S. Strike two. Got a different cup, this time the inside had stains of some other dirt, possibly cream or coffee from the previous customer. I pointed out to the waitress that she could run her finger inside it and feel the dirt. By that time she ran inside and came out very soon with the same cup she possibly just rinsed under the faucet.  I was totally grossed out and just wanted to leave. I don't think the staff has had any training in hygiene codes.   Anyway I'd rather walk over to Tim Hortons a block or two away - get my $ 2 coffee and sit on any bench of Memorial Park knowing I am not drinking bacteria or other ladies lipstick. The management  did not charge us for my husbands coffee and were very apologetic, but that is just not good enough. Won't be visiting that place again."}
{"text":"I tried out Boxwood during Big Taste and I was very happy with my choice!  My fiance and I were both really impressed with how all the ingredients on the menu are sourced locally.. the chicken, the lamb, the vegetables.. All except the fish, which comes from BC. And thats to be expected, since Alberta is pretty much landlocked!  Apart from the white bean dip in the beginning - which was okay - everything else we tasted was so flavourful! We had the chicken dish and the lamb dish as mains. The chicken was juicy, well-seasoned and the kale and honey squash were amazing accompaniments! The lamb was gamey, and also very tasty!   We had the potatoes and cauliflower for sides, and once again, so flavourful! The potatoes were cooked to a nice crispiness, and the cauliflower.. oh man, roasted cauliflower is awesome.   The restaurant itself is adorable. A nice cabin-y feel with lots of big windows.. right in the middle of a park. Such a cute date night spot!!   Our waitress was also adorable, warm and happy. I noticed the prices on the regular menu were not exactly cheap, but I do understand that slow local food does not come in bulk, and thus cannot be cheap. I don't mind paying for quality food and sustainable operations!  All in all, really enjoyed this place. We will for sure be back. This place must be absolutely lovely in the summer!!"}
{"text":"Man, Calgary knows how to do their local, organic cafes right! Little cafe in the park? Sure! Super cute? Hell yeah!  In the corner of a little park, this is probably the coolest, most rustic, and cute cafe in all of downtown Calgary! With a nice view from the inside and great patio seats, this makes one of the best lunch locations, hands down!  Cam here upon a suggestion by a friend, and boy was I glad I listened to him. Walked in to a pretty busy lunch time and a massive takeout line! Lots of people buy their lunch and eat in the park, which is an awesome idea already! Everything served at Boxwood is local and organic, and it definitely makes a difference.  I had the Prochetta Sandwich, as that seemed to be a fan favourite! Oh. My. Goodness! Probably one of the few sandwiches I've had that were so divine, I was smiling and enjoying it more with each and every bite. And this is coming from a guy that doesn't like bread! The prochetta was beautiful with marinated kale and some kind of jam on a beautiful house made Ciabatta bread!  If you're from the Calgary area and haven't been to Boxwood yet, you are definitely missing out! This is one of the spots everyone has to check out!"}
{"text":"Although not what I expected, I found the food really tasty, clean, and had a fine-dining feel to it.  However, I was not impressed with the decor, service, and washrooms of the restaurant. The place has a more casual feel, which did not seem in line with the food served."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Boxwood for the first time earlier this evening. We chose to sit outside on the patio. We thought we'd start with coffee, and go from there...one for myself, and a decaf for my wife. Unfortunately, her cream curdled like cottage cheese the moment she poured it into her cup (strike 1). The waitress brought another decanter of decaf with a fresh cream and a new coffee cup. This time the coffee cup had big lipstick stains around the rim (strike 2).  We pointed this out to the waitress, and she told us that it could be wiped off. I honestly did not know how to respond to that logic (strike 3). We politely asked her to bring a new one, to which she obliged. Only now there was dried on food particles all around the cup, inside and out! (strike 4). You could see and feel them with your finger around the entire inner portion of the cup. I walked over to where the waitress was at her outdoor server station...I said \"please run your finger around the inside of this cup\". She said, \"oh, I'm sorry. This cup has probably been sitting outside for awhile, that's why it's dirty\". I told her that wasn't the reason, and that dried on food on glassware tends to mean their dishwasher tank needs to be drained & refilled with clean water, and the screens/filters need to be cleared of food scraps/debris. She then looked at me sideways, smiled, and put the glass into a bus tub filled with cold water that was situated beneath her outdoor server station (used for cleaning tables), and gave it a wipe with a rag. Seconds later she appeared at our table with a coffee cup. Was it the same one she was wiping out with her rag a moment earlier? I'd like to think not, but based on what I'd seen and heard up to this point, it wouldn't surprise me in the least (possible strike 5??).  I then told her to forget our order as we were leaving. I went inside and explained the whole ordeal to what appeared to be a manager. I told her I was willing to pay for my coffee (even though I'd only had a few sips). I also asked if their dishwasher was functioning correctly, and if the rinse temp was up to the health code's 190F temp. She nodded, said yes. I suggested that she might want to consider draining and cleaning it. She told me not to worry about paying for my coffee, and at that we left.  Having worked in the food & beverage industry for many years, I was appalled by the unsatisfactory level of sanitation. This place really needs to monitor and/or train their staff in proper food handling procedures.  Don't get me wrong, as our server was very polite, but the poor girl was totally clueless regarding correct food handling procedures, cleanliness, etc. I blame part of this on poor management, and improper training. The rest just boils down to a lack of common sense on her part I suppose.  If The Boxwood's dirty glassware and cups are inserted into racks (which I presume they are), then placed inside a dishwasher, it's safe to assume that many coffee cups sharing those same rack(s) suffered this fate.  Here's a suggestion; Drain and clean your dishwasher a little more frequently...then check soap levels and temperature. Follow this up with an inspection of the dish-ware before distributing to patrons. When I drink a cup of coffee, I'd rather not have lipstick stains, and remnants of the evening entrées spattered all over my cup.  Several negative health code strikes within 10 minutes of being seated! Wow... we won't be visiting The Boxwood again.  Oh...one more thing. The Boxwood is located within a war veteran's memorial park. A place where my family and I have gone for decades to honour our soldiers, past and present. How on earth is a supposed high end restaurant able to operate within this park?? Do they at least offer a percentage of their profits to the veterans and their families? Somehow I doubt it."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch, and absolutely fell in love with everything. The location - so adorable. The menu - short, but interesting and very GF appropriate. The staff - friendly!   I had the seared tuna salad, and it was lovely. The dressing complimented everything in the salad very well, and was a perfect size for lunch. We sat at the communal table, but there are lots of window seats and in good weather, outdoor seating as well, it appears. If I lived nearby, I'd want to be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Really well designed venue inside and out, with a really awesome atmosphere right when you step in.  The menu is quite brilliant, albeit overpriced. I had the prochetta sandwich and my fiancee had the rotisserie chicken sandwich. Both were very dry, with the pork being the biggest letdown, being tough and dry. The veggies were really fresh, and I must say that the chicken  sandwich was quite ingeniously built with interesting ingredients like basil aioli and green apple.  The strangest thing was the service. It wasn't exactly.. unfriendly. But I really felt like some sort of outsider who was being given the ultimate privilege of eating there.  Quite a few of the staff's friends were in there in true hipster fashion and were chatting the entire time.  Here's a great opportunity to interact with your customer in the brilliantly designed bar-to-open-kitchen layout. Instead  I was brushed off as not being part of the clique. I know that sounds weird, but I don't know how else to describe it.  It was the most bizarre service experience I've ever had.  I should also add that it was quite slow for what it was (sandwiches). There might be a training issue there as the cook seemed quite slow to find ingredients, etc.    I also found it to be quite overpriced, though it may be worth it if everyone in the venue is on their A game because the ingredients are certainly worth visiting this place for. Just bring your plaid and thick brimmed glasses and hope you know someone there and you'll be 5-starring this place in no time!"}
{"text":"Perfect noon hour date spot to unwind with a GF. Ambiance was great as usual. Snow as a backdrop for comforting foods is what makes for a perfect Calgary snow day. The hummus was amazing as usual. The albacore tuna, not so much. I'm going to stick to my go-to chickpea fritters."}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine a nicer atmosphere for dining.  A person can go casual or dressed up.  We sat outside under the patio heater, with the park beside us.  The patio seating was  very comfortable, usually outside chairs are not.   The waiter didn't show up for a while, we wondered if we were noticed.  I definately could relate to the other reviews about the aloof staff.  He wasn't at par with the atmosphere (nor the prices).  The concept of this menu is you have to order everything separately - meat, carb,veg.   Both Hubby and I were ok with the prices until we saw the portions.  $19 for one chicken leg!  The flavoring was nice but not something I couldn't do at home.  They have  this lovely garden with fresh herbs and I expected to see fresh herbs on the chicken.  The lamb was tasty.  The side dish of a BBQ'd leek was good but $10.   The layered potatoe side dish also pricey and not fresh, looked like it was sitting there for hours.  The rhubard dessert was delicious. The desserts are not enough to share. All in all it was alright and could be much better.  Our bill was $110 for two which included one glass of wine and two desserts."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try the Boxwood after having walked by here numerous times. Wow what a great cafe by a park perfect for people gazing. We enjoyed our meal to the sight of local capoeriaristas practicing their cartwheel kicks on a sunny Tuesday night.  I got their beet salad with a local ale, while my companion went with a more protein based meal of chicken and wine. I managed to sneak a few bites of the chicken and wow, it was full of flavour. My beet salad was fresh but I wasn't quite sure if I had paired it right with my beer. Then again salads and beer bro? Come on.  I'd love to try their cocktails next time I drop by."}
{"text":"The pork sandwich reminds me of crispy pork you can get at Chinese butcher shops. Juicy, pink meat slices, flavourful fatty crispy bits of skin sandwiched between soft yet chewy pieces of foccacia bread. The chickpea sandwich was another winner - creamy and filling. Have to say between the two - t the pork wins - I just prefer it taste wise. Ice-cream sandwich with Saskatoon berries was delicious."}
{"text":"No better patio at which to grab some grub and a refreshing drink on a hot sticky Calgary summer day. Located beside Memorial Park downtown, where you can catch a glimpse of splaying fountains and lush park gardens, Boxwood is a fantastic gathering spot, best for a small group in the afternoon.  My chickpea fritters were comparable to a gourmet falafel, with a sensational balance of textures and flava. The water is served in tall glass bottles which is also lovely. We grabbed some desserts as well, the caramel raspberry brownie for my gal pal, and the Fiasco Gelato maple ice cream sandwich (umm, amazing!)  Before dining here, I was under the impression that they had sky-high prices, however I'd willingly pay just over 10$ for a sandwich and a spot on their sweet patio."}
{"text":"Boxwood, what happened to you?  You were that little engine that could, defying the odds with your little size and questionable location.  You shone like a beacon, drawing in fans to the once drug-infested Memorial Park, with your service, hearty food, and tranquil patio.  But on our last visit, that beacon seemed to have dimmed somewhat.   Starting with the service, which have been quite good in the past, but this time there seemed to have been a confusion as to whose table we were.  We had a rotating tag-team duo, of sorts, looking after us, with one that seem inexperienced and the other following up to troubleshoot.  Common sense dictates that if coffee is ordered, a spoon should go along with the cup.  When someone asks for cream, don't bring milk.  Make sure everyone has cutlery.  And check the food before you bring it to the table in case the kitchen forgets something.  But these are all minor nitpicks that can easily be resolved.  The food, however, might require a bit of an overhaul!  I always order the porchetta sandwich, as it is their signature dish.  Instead of the thick, hand-sliced pieces of pork, I got these thinly-sliced pieces like the kind that you buy over the counter at any deli.  It's obviously been sliced on a machine because it was uniform and cold.  They must've pulled it 'fresh' out of the fridge instead of their rotisserie.   My GF ordered one of their daily specials, lamb meatloaf with a side salad with vinaigrette.  For $12, we expected something more than the measly 4 oz piece of cold meatloaf with a small salad that was missing the dressing.  We didn't know if the little bit of un-dressed greens were suppose to be a salad or a garnish.  Again, the dish was served cold, out of the fridge instead of the oven.  It was as though we were served last nights' leftovers instead of the daily offerings!  Through it all, we sat alongside 13 Ave. which is entirely under construction.  We had a great view of the 10 ft., orange-coloured, steel fencing that ran down the length of the street.  It's like having brunch at the DMZ along North Korea.  Good thing it was a Sunday and there was no construction crew working.  Should there be any wind, you'll be  getting a mouthful of dirt along with your meal.  Here's hoping that like 13 Ave., you're just going through a phase.  That our experience is not indicative of what you're truly capable of.  And, hopefully, after all the repairs' done, you'll be back to your former glory."}
{"text":"We visited this place early on a Friday evening so that we could make it on time for happy hour. When we got there, the place was not that busy - a handful of tables out on the patio and one other group inside. Our waitress was very friendly, but she seemed confused when I mentioned the happy hour (it's on their website..) and kind of brushed it off. She also ID-ed us for alcohol (which I am ok with) but didn't mention the student discount that they offer as mentioned on their website.   The location seemed really nice but there were a ton of construction around the restaurant so parking was a bit difficult - which I do not blame them for.   Overall, everything seemed so overpriced for what you got. I can't complain that the food was bad because most of it was decent but the amount of food that you got for what you paid.. definitely not worth it. There was definitely nothing that I am dying to go back for except maybe the hummus. For the amount of money I spent there, I could get much much better food elsewhere. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Everything we tried here was excellent. Very fresh ingredients with unique dishes. We loved every bite. The desserts were the best I've had that I can remember."}
{"text":"This adorable little cafe is definitely one of my new favourite places to catch up with a friend. Cute, cabin-feel cafe with a delicious menu. I definitely would recommend this place for a nice casual evening!"}
{"text":"We were looking for casual lunch on a Sunday morning and we decided to try this charming cafe located in a small park. The location is perfect, I am sure during  the summer the patio is fantastic.   As soon as I entered the restaurant, I was mesmerized by the scene of the chef cutting a home made Porchetta. At that moment, I was sure what I am going to order :D The decor and ambiance was very welcoming and cozy.   I ordered the Porchetta ciabatta sandwich (11$). The sandwich was simple but delicious. Generous amount of pork meat with arugula and house sauce.   Before we leave, I realized they have 4 beers on tap. I am sure, I will defiantly go back there for a drink and some more delicious food.   Generally, if you are looking for a quick casual quality sandwich, I highly recommend this place. It is a very good location for a friendly gathering."}
{"text":"Boxwood is tiny but doesn't feel cramped--keep in mind I grew up in a mega-city, so my idea of personal space might be cozier than most people's. I've mostly come here for lunch, and it's best to arrive between 1130-1145 to beat the noon rush. On a mild day, get patio seating. The menu changes regularly, but if you've been to River Café (sister restaurant on Princes Island) you're already acquainted with proprietor Sal Howell's philosophy: local/regional + sustainable slow food, meant to be savoured and experienced. In the middle of a busy workday, this reprieve is not an indulgence, it's a balm for the harried soul."}
{"text":"I returned to Boxwood last weekend for an early dinner with some friends. I had been there once before, my sister told me about it and we had a really delicious lunch there. I haven't been back since, so I was excited to experience it again. Since there were 5 of us, I knew we would probably have to wait since it's quite a small place. Very cute inside though, and I love that it's in the middle of a park! So fun. When we were seated we ordered wine, but for some reason we didn't get wine glasses. Just regular glasses? Weird...since I remember the first time I went that we definitely drank out of wine glasses. Wasn't a big fan of that, but...whatever. We started with the cheese selection and the albacore tuna. Both were amazing, the tuna had a wonderful aoili type of sauce on it, mixed with the fruit it was delicious. The cheese was excellent as well. For dinner I had their special, which was a roast with a side salad. The roast was a wee bit cold for my liking, but good otherwise. Salad was to be expected, it was tasty. We ended up ordering the asian noodles as well, because we were still hungry (the portions aren't the biggest), and they were VERY good. We splurged on dessert too, which was the warm apple crisp! Yum. I was so happy with our meal, when I saw my boyfriend I told him we needed to go back there as soon as possible. I love this idea of a restaurant in a park, and the food was so interesting/healthy/yummy. I will absolutely be back, and hopefully soon (but please get some wine glasses, or I will be forced to bring my own! Lol)"}
{"text":"Went for a weekday lunch.  small space, but the waitress was eager to seat us.  love that tables are shared.  Beautiful venue in the park.  I could smell the beets roasting in the kitchen and had the beet salad, which looked really small on arrival, but fit the bill perfectly.  We shared a pot of peppermint tea, with lemon on the waitress' suggestion (I was feeling the beginnings of a cold so I requested lemon tea), and my colleague had a chick pea fritter sandwich.  Not at all snotty for such a classy looking space.  I will be back. Unique offering, lovely spot, tasty food."}
{"text":"Boxwood gets its four stars from the fact that they source their ingredients locally, they've got an amazing location on the edge of Memorial Park, their staff is friendly and welcoming and they filter their own water.  I stopped in for lunch on a very chilly Saturday. Although having walked by it several times over the last year, I had never actually been inside of Boxwood before. I had visions of it being a fancier sit-down style establishment. Instead, I found a \"seat yourself\" place, either at one of their tables or along the bar facing the park. We sat at the bar. Ordering took place up at the counter, servers brought out our food when it was ready.  The chickpea sandwich jumped out at me from the menu, I ordered this with a fair-trade organic hot chocolate and a saskatoon ice cream sandwich for dessert. The hot chocolate was real hot chocolate, as in it had a hint of bitterness that comes with using cocoa rather than the uber-sweetened powdered stuff so many of us are used to. I'm pretty sure the ice cream sandwich was made in-house, right down to the wafers holding in the ice cream. The chickpea sandwich came on ciabatta bread and hit the spot. It wasn't too big, or too small, but of Goldilocks proportions (or \"just right\"). I expected the sandwich to at least have a small side salad or even a couple of fresh veggies to come with it. Sadly, it did not. For me, that's what was holding Boxwood back from a five-star review. Delicious food, awesome service, impeccable location, but at nearly $30 for lunch, I felt like it was missing just a little something.  Anyway, I'm having visions of what Boxwood is like in the evening. I must take a stroll in that direction some night when the weather is back in our favour and the newness of spring is in the air."}
{"text":"A cafe in the middle of the park? What a great idea!  The location was absolutely spot on.  There's a patio so it's perfect for those blazing, hot summer days; and on those brisk, cold days, you can warm yourself inside the cottage type embellishment.  It almost feels like you're in Banff.  The menu is very simple, just a few items to choose from.  Lately, everywhere I've been have tried the more organic, healthy route.  The one item that stuck out was the duck egg with avocado focaccia which I mistakenly thought it was duck meat to begin with.  I also tried the pulled pork sandwich.  The duck egg was cooked soft which I prefer and the avocado blended well. The pulled pork was decent and I'd recommend for those that crave a more zing to their sandwich. It wasn't amazing nor was it bad.  Would I be able to finish the whole sandwich myself? I don't know if I can.  The food wasn't amazing but I love the atmosphere and homey feel.    We initially sat outside because there was no room inside.  The weather was getting gloomy so they turned the heat lamp on and even bought us out blankets.  They made sure we were alright and taken care  of so kudos for that.  Prices were reasonable, $10 for a sandwich; although it would be better if it came with a little side.  What a great place to chill during the summertime, whether it being day or night.  Come in, seat yourself or write your name on the chalkboard wall and eat away."}
{"text":"Boxwood is one of the few places in Calgary that you can get local, organic, delicious food. I have been trying to eat local and organic as much as possible. Which means I'm at Boxwood at least twice a week. The service is always so friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend Boxwood to clients, family and friends!"}
{"text":"Honest fresh wholesome food. Nice relaxing setting and atmosphere - friendly service."}
{"text":"I had my first dinner experience at Boxwood with pals over the weekend. I was very charmed upon arriving. Showing up early, I took in the breathtakingly brisk late October evening, sitting on a bench outside, facing the fountains of Memorial Park. When my friendsfinally turned up a few minutes later, I was equally charmed to take in the warmth and beauty of Boxwood, a tiny little gem not unlike a wood cabin with mostly windows for walls.  It was quite busy, so we had to take a seat against the bar, which was fine by me. The staff were friendly and fetched us our local Black Pilsners, giving us adequate time to mull over the menu. Being vegan, there were limited options for me (obviously, it has rotisserie in the name), but I managed. In fact, I don't think either of my friends ended up with meat dishes either.  I got the chance to try the red lentil hummus, and you know what guys? Not the most impressive. I mean, it was okay, definitely edible, but I'm still convinced I'll never find a good hummus in a restaurant on Calgary, aside from some of my favourite mediteranean nooks. Other places should seriously stop trying, it's depressing. The crackers were neat, despite the blandness of the hummus. I also had the quinoa salad, which came in a cute portion. I wanted to love this dish, but again was underwhelmed. The quinoa was actually quite crunchy, as though 3/4 cooked through. I feel I would have enjoyed it otherwise, but I've definitely made better quinoa salads for lunches at home.  So, really, I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm only giving Boxwood 4 stars for it's atmosphere, and the tasty black pilsner. I did state several times throughout the course of the evening that I wanted to live in Boxwood, or build a similar nook in the middle of the woods.  I also do like the organic, simple concept, and hope that other menu items are executed a little better.  I might be back for the lunch menu, but I'd rather be at the Coup or somewhere else in the area, for the prices and a more vegan friendly selection."}
{"text":"A generic experience in a unique space; service was fine, food was okay, menu looked pretty good, but overall two stars.    I ordered the seared tuna which was too salty (for my taste) and too much salad dressing was used (on what might have been a nice salad).  I like the idea of their menu, and don't mind that the portions are small, but overall experience wasn't that great."}
{"text":"We heard about the Boxwood from the Food Channel's You Gotta Eat Here Show. It looked so good we had to come to taste the food when we were in the area.  The Boxwood is in an ideal location if you ask me. There's the Central Memorial Park on one side & office buildings on the other side. I had one of specials for lunch, a lamb meatball sandwich in ciabatta bread. Hubby had the chickpea fritter sandwich. I was full already after half of the sandwich. But it was so good I ate the other half & stuffed myself. No matter, we went for a nice long walk afterwards to work off the food.   Waitstaff were friendly & efficient. And the space itself has a nice modern, airy, yet homey feeling. Next time I'm in Calgary I'm going to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The Central Memorial Park, to me, stands as a symbol of this city's remarkable rebirth over the last few years from a ho-hum Prairie, corporate oil-town, to a burdgeoning cultural, and cosmopolian metropolis. Remember a few years ago, how you are were scared to even venture into the park during the day? It was a sure thing to see vagrants, addicts, and the occasional syringe on the park's unkempt pathways.  Then, in Summer 2010, the park was re-opened (by the Queen of the Netherlands, no less) as a reinvigorated inner-city park, and has since, developed into a bit of a hang-out for the local neighbourhood. It has made things generally more lovely, and is a more worthy pedestal for Calgary's rare Carnegie sandstone library  In my opinion, Boxwood has been essential to this transformation. I mean, how delightfully novel to convert a storage shed (or washroom, I believe) into a wonderful little bistro. I've only ever been to Boxwood for lunch, but I have been pleased with the relaxed atmosphere, the simple, but local menu, and the relatively inexpensive prices."}
{"text":"The location for Boxwood is fantastic for lunch. Stroll through the Central Memorial Park before or after and visit the library nearby, a great landmark in Calgary."}
{"text":"I've been accused of being somewhat loquacious so in the interest of brevity, here's my review Haiku:  Simple comfort food Rustic vibe, attentive staff Save room for dessert  That is all."}
{"text":"I went there only for drinks and unfortunately I have nothing good to say ... The first wine was probably the worst wine I have ever had!! The second wine was the the second worst wine I have ever had!! Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this place... Well, maybe the location... Which probably is the one star I'm rating them... But other than that... Nothing else... Food was not good, and service unimpressive... I really hope they realize the good location where they are at, and improve their service and the quality of their food and drinks ..."}
{"text":"Was wandering the streets of Calgary, looking for a late-night coffee, when I came upon this gem. No generic espresso chain here; French pressed coffee and fudge brownie with a strawberry coulis were a perfect finish to the evening."}
{"text":"Just got kicked out after dinner. This place sucks now! Don't come here! I wanted to finish my drink but no! $90 is not enough to stay here!!!! Don't ever come here! Please avoid This place! 26 years in the restaurant biz and this place is crap! Don't spend any money here! I would fire the manager who is on his computer when guests arrive! The service is ok but not too great! It's not professional at all! More like a school cafeteria!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner with my sister. Although the location and decor is fantastic, I found the service and menu pretty disappointing. I was really hungry so looked over the menu for dishes with a healthy serving of protein. Basically, they seem to specialize gluten-free salads. I ordered the pork and it tasted terrible (a stack of fatty meat and potatoes, virtually impossible to decipher in that low light what was what) while my sisters lamb gnocchi pasta was making me jealous, so I politely sent back the pork and asked for the lamp pasta instead. It arrived and I had a hard time finding much meat in my dish. When the bill came I was surprised to find that the pork which I had two bites of had not been discounted in the slightest, nor did the server apologize for my having been disappointed. I would only come here again for drinks, if someone insisted."}
{"text":"A fun location with relaxing view for Calgary downtown.  I came in a sunny day so that alone I am sure affects ambiance.   I found the staff to be friendly and engaging. The sandwiches and snacks were tasty, though I did feel my chicken sandwich could have had a bit more meat in it for an a-la-cart $10 sandwich.  Wine in a tumbler...a no no regardless of how 'fun' you're trying to be.  I would come again to try dinner entrees."}
{"text":"I took my two university aged children to re-discover their city and after visiting the library, checked out lunch at the Boxwood Café.  Lunch came to $94.00 for three adults and I was very disappointed.  Here is a list of things to do better: When charging $14 for a thin lunch sandwich, throw on a salad or a bit of lentil soup.  It doesn't cost that much to add and makes the plate look fuller.  My 22 year old son was still hungry leaving the restaurant.  The iced tea was $4 and not much more than red food colored water.  There was no flavour or even sweetness to it.  The pitcher of sangria wasn't much better.  There was little wine or brandy in it and although it had taste, not much was alcohol.  The worst offense was that we had ordered drinks and our waiter brought a bottle of water that was half full and poured us small glasses of water without our permission. He never refilled the water nor asked if we wanted it. I discovered a $1 charge per person for the water.  Really?  Charge for water in Calgary? This was a grossly over-expensive restaurant.  All for the privilege of running from wasps (no wasp traps hung up) and listening to construction 10 metres a way.   Save your money and patronize the food trucks and enjoy lunch on the free tables a metre away!"}
{"text":"Cute and quaint little venue downtown.   The location is great with it being right on a park.   This place has great potential.  They have unique sandwich offerings - I had a chicken with apple and aioli, and it was on the freshest ciabatta I've ever had.   The chicken however was not seasoned at all, and tasted like the leftover rotisserie chicken you buy from the supermarket.   I liked the crunch of the apple, but at this point nothing could save the dry, nasty chicken.  It took 10 minutes too long to get my sandwich, as the snooty staff was too busy chatting amongst themselves to give a crap that they had customers waiting for take-out.    If you run a food shack, you should really work on having a non-elitist, positive attitude.   And if all you have to make are 2 sandwiches on a Sun. afternoon they should be out pretty quick because its a friggin' sandwich you have to make.    Not some 4 course meal.  Pretty disappointed with what could be a really great place to eat."}
{"text":"food was good, and it's super cute inside. service was the shits. Lemongrass hand soap in the washroom was AMAZING! oh and we only got one set of cutlery/napkin. I asked for another set but never received. we shared. it worked out fine."}
