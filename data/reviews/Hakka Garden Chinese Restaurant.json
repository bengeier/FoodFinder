{"text":"Drove past this place for years and finally decided to give it a try after reading a review online. We took the reviewers suggestion of having the chilli chicken and crispy beef, in addition we ordered a manchurian chow mein.   Chilli chicken was very good. Very good gravy to go with the steamed rice. The crispy beef was a bit disappointing - it was very sweet and tasted like a dessert rather than an entree.  Felt like asking for a side of whipped cream or ice cream to go with the beef. Manchurian chow mein with chicken was good - did not cheap out on the chicken like a lot of other hakka places do.   Portions are large which was perfect for is - we had lunch for the next day.  Owners and servers were pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was quite busy the Sunday evening we went - a few large parties. Had we come a few minutes later we would have had to wait for a table.   Will be back to try the other items on the menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Must try chicken chowmein and hakka special fried rice.  Only go during Friday,  Saturday and Sunday.  The food quality lacks other days.  I wish it was consist like when I opened earlier. The place is definately worth it."}
{"text":"This is a small family restaurant in Thorncliffe Park. Has about 12-15 tables. We were a group of 6 and there were only about 3 tables that could accommodate a group of that size. Most of their business seems to be take out.   For appetizers we got the chicken lollipop and manchurian, both were quite good.   For the main course we got veg hakka chowmein (noodles) and veg manchurian fried rice. The entree dishes were garlic chicken, thai chicken, veg manchurian balls, veg sweet and sour balls, and chilli potato. The portions are huge and we ended up taking some of the food home.  The food is regular chinese hakka food - oily and spicy/hot. Not the best I've had in the GTA, there are better options in Mississauga and Scarborough, but for someone that lives downtown, it's a good option to have \"in\" the city.  Service leaves much to be desired. The server waiting on was impatient and almost rude. My friend had a couple of questions about the menu, and her body language suggested that she thought we were wasting her time. I understand that she probably had a busy day, but if you are mean to customers, then you probably shouldn't be in the service business to begin with.  All in all, an average experience. Flavours are meh, but if you're someone who values quantity over quality, this could be what you're looking for.   We spent about $20-$25 per person, which included a drink each."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant.  We love the fusion of Indian and Chinese flavours and the variety this restaurant offers.  The chili chicken (dry) is a must try."}
{"text":"We started with the corn and chicken soup. I don't usually order this but I'm not sure there's anything you can do to make this soup extraordinary. It was as expected. Pretty delicious if you like this particular soup.   The chicken pakora came next. They were super tasty. The crispy beef was as delicious as other reviewers reported. I'd agree with it being amazing. The last dish Manchurian chicken was on the meh side.   Overall, the food was very good. Everything was freshly made. The server was friendly and gave us suggestions when asked. Lots of people came in to pick up take out while we were there on a Thursday night. I'll definitely keep this place in mind when in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their hot and sour chicken soup. That's probably the only thing I like here and keep returning for the same. I must add the taste has not always been consistent though, best guess being the cooks are changing ever so often. The chicken Manchurian and Bombay fish are nice. One thing I don't understand at most Hakka Chinese places is as to why they choose to use those thick noodles. That's one thing they should change.  Well priced for the service and ambience. If it wasn't for the soup I could do without going here ever so often. I must add that the Ambience is a big let down for me when writing a review."}
{"text":"My first impression is not good. No service may they are busy. Even they have not offered water. Ordered wonton soup it's just water and wontons and taste is not at all. Ordered Chicken fried rice and Bombay shrimp, in fried rice you have to search for chicken and egg, though the Bombay shrimp spice and tasted well the quantity and size was limited. Still waiting for the bill to pay and go home. They don't accept credit cards.   Overall, if don't have other option and very fund of spicy Hakka come here. No expectation of service."}
{"text":"I have been multiple times and this is a classic hakka restaurant. Don't go in expecting keg level service but if you know hakka food this place does not disappoint.  They have well-priced lunch specials and contrary to other reviews the portions were more than enough.   The fried rice is always done well and the dishes are spiced accordingly. The chilli chicken is my favourite with the garlic chicken a close second, the only complaint to be made is that the variety between flavors can be hard to distinguish. As someone else mentioned some of the dishes taste the same but they taste good so its not a  deal breaker for me. The give lots of of gravy with the dishes if you don't select the dry version which I love.   Overall I recommend this to anyone looking for hakka food in this area of the city, I don't think there are many other spots this far west. It's probably better for take-out as the eat in experience is nothing special but the food is definitely good!  Must tries: Chili chicken with friend rice."}
{"text":"While the ambiance may be bare and the service may be mediocre, I can honestly say, taste wise, this has to be one of the best Hakka (Indian style Chinese) restaurants in Toronto. My favorite dish here is the chilli paneer - and for those of you paneer lovers who order it a lot at various restaurants, you will obviously know that you are usually skimped and often just given 5 or 6 pieces. WELL NOT HERE - you get a plate full of paneer! The flavor of the chilli sauce is to die for so I'm sure the chilli chicken or beef will be just as good (I have not tried it as I am a vegetarian). For those of you who are Muslims, this place is Halal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service!  I absolutely love eating here, chilli chicken and manchurian noodles are the best out of the menu I would say!   Just writing this review makes my mouth water :)"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to's for Hakka.  The others being Faley's (also on Overlea) and Chili Chicken House in Mississauga.  The food here is good - some of our standards are Chili Chicken (dry);  Crispy beef;  Chili paneer (dry);  Hakka noodles;  and spicy green beans.  Quality has been fairly consistent throughout our many visits.  We have noticed, however, that we get terribly thirsty after our meals, and attribute this to the use of MSG.  Fortunately, we do not get any severe reactions to MSG, but would prefer our food to be MSG-free, so we do not eat here often.  The restaurant is busy, so we sometimes order take-out instead, but even this requires a bit of a wait.  We have found that if we place our order just when leaving home (downtown), by the time we get to the restaurant, it is typically ready for pick-up depending on how congested the DVP is.  For dining in, service is efficient.  They have limited staff, so even when a table is freed up, it takes time for them to clear the tables.  But the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"garlic chicken is my fav. I have never been disappointed with anything they serve.  worth trying for sure. I am a regular. Lunch special is good too"}
{"text":"Recently ordered Take out from here. This is legit Hakka food, it's very tasty. Prices are reasonable and portions are big.  Only downsides, order took almost an hour to get ready and there aren't any real healthy options (steamed fish or steamed vegetables for example). Then again, you probably aren't ordering Hakka food for it's healthy qualities.  I will order again!"}
{"text":"This is our Go To place for Indian Chinese. It has never dissapointed us. The service is always good and friendly.   The soups are awesome just like in india.. i can understand that its very different than the kind of soups you get here but its exactly the way you get in india in an indian chinese restaurant. So ...overall very nostalgic.  The paneer pakoda is super awesome.. crunchy outside and soft inside."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian Hakka Chinese restaurants for take out. The food is fabulous and very much Indian taste. We love the chicken manchurian fried rice,chicken chowmein and garlic chicken gravy."}
{"text":"Ventured here before going to the Ontario Science Centre. The place has a cute\" mom and pop\" vibe. It is VERY CLEAN inside. The food is authentically Hakka (heard the staff speaking hakka as well). Staff were very attentive and pleasant!  hakka chow mein - 3/5   mixed pakora - 4/5 (thought the \"mixed\" meant a sampler of the different types of pakora but, it really meant that they mixed up all the meats into the batter! Was a pleasant accident though! There is a minty, coriander sauce that goes with it...soooo good)  chili chicken - 4/5 (very crispy)    hot and sour soup - 4/5 (I ate more than my share...so goood...and it was hot as the name implies...temperature-wise. My fault though...it smelled so good. The cleft of my mouth blistered.)"}
{"text":"Again another halal Hakka Chinese restaurant that falls below par in service and quality of food which really bums me out 1. Soup was watery and tasteless 2. Food was overall very oil (more than most places) 3. Service was just bad -"}
{"text":"Luv the food :) I go here regularly, have tried too many hakka chinese restaurants and no one is close to what hakka garden has. Amazing food and the owner lady is very nice :)  Fast service I have tried Masala Chicken, Chicken lollipop, Manchurian Chicken and Paneer, Machurian Panner and Paneer chilly is awesome,Noodles, egg fried rice and many more.  The owner lady always suggests when asked and recommeds some amazing dishes.   Highly recommend everyone to try the best hakka chinese in Toronto at Hakka Garden :)"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 Customer Service: 1  My family and I order from here regularly. Food is decent (it's not food that you end up craving) and take out portions are large.   They have terrible customer service. I did a phone order and I told the person on the phone that I wanted a dry noodle (one that was crispy, not cooked through in water) and she said she knew what I was talking about and put Shanghai noodles.  We did not check the order because it was nicely wrapped (our fault for not checking though) and I discovered they were not the type of noodle I wanted. I wanted the actual noodle to be dry, not dry sauce put on it.   I asked if I could get a credit towards my next purchase because we regularly purchase orders over $30, and the manager said yes, but next time I should know what I want because the part-time workers don't work all the time and don't know everything. Any legitimate and customer oriented restaurant would never say this, so I told her we would not come back ever again."}
{"text":"Average food and mediocre setting but there seems to be no real competition in downtown Toronto for Hakka food so they are pretty busy."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I already cannot wait until I can come back!  We got the crispy beef (amazing), veggie hakka chow mein (great), veggie pakoras (also amazing), chicken lollipops (good), chicken dumplings (good) and manchurian chicken (okay).  I could not get enough of the crispy beef and veggie pakoras.  Being Desi, you think you know a pakora pretty well. But I'm here to tell you that you don't know what a pakora can actually be until you've had some of theirs."}
{"text":"Always ask for their fish fry......omg it's just made to perfect. The only thing disappointing is the cleanliness. Food is really good. I won't recommend you to try their soups as they are sour for some reason."}
{"text":"Good value and quite tasty.  If you feel for some Hakka cuisine which is a medley between Chinese and Indian cooking, give this place a try.  Lots of variety on the menu, clean and reasonably priced although compared to other Hakka spots the serving portion is not that big.  It's a small sit down place in a strip plaza near don mills and eglinton.   Not the trendiest area,but you're there for the food right?"}
{"text":"Always a stop when the extended family is in town. Food is great for all types of eaters. Quantity coud be more per meal for the price but taste is savoury.  Service can be better, all the wait staff and the cashiers look like they hate their life and are never happy especially the lady working. Ruins it for me as I normally get take out after work and dont need the negativity, so switched to Faleys a block away.  I would recommend the food as takeout, maybe once a month or so..."}
{"text":"Best damn Hakka in Scarborough.  Tried all the Hakka joints in Scarborough,  but this joint has good food and backs the food up with good service. I keep on coming back for the chicken pakoras, chilli chicken and crispy ginger beef.   Can't go wrong with these choices."}
{"text":"It use to be very good but recently they have decreased the quantity significantly. Also the customer service is not great. Food is okay. Personally, it is halal and that's the reason I go there."}
{"text":"Love the food!   Haven't sat down to experience the place but it is a pretty mediocre area so usually do takeout. it usually ruins my workouts days...it's so cheap you can't help but to upgrade every order to a fried rice..Yumm! The service is quick and usually pretty busy during the hours of 8:30pm onwards however order in advance and expect the order to be ready under 15 minute.   The staff is very helpful, tend to make good recommendations. The price, as previously mentioned, it's cheap i.e. order for chicken chilli with fried rice and a drink= $12.90 after tax and it's enough for two.    Definitely  coming back... you know once I'm done being serious about the gym; the portion are too big for one person."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Try the dry chili beef-you won't be disappointed. Garlic chicken is also very tasty."}
{"text":"I make a really long drive just to eat here. Everything is so delicious! It beats any other Hakka restaurant out there, and I've been to a lot.   Favourites: Hot and sour soup, shrimp fried rice, pakoras, and ginger chicken  The only down side is the restaurant seating and interior, it definitely needs an upgrade."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent portion. Had the Cantonese chow main, Singapore noodles, beef and noodle, as well as chicken fried rice.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Corn starch galore! I understand that Hakka cuising uses starch to add a glaze to their sauces, but not like this.   I was there with my family and we ordered hot and sour soup, Manchurian chicken, fried rice, another beef disk, and I think chow mein. It was really disappointing.   The hot and sour soup was thick. Like mucus. The heavy corn star consistency. Really not appetizing.  And same with the meat and their sauces. I couldn't eat more than a few bites.   We ate at the restaurant and it was stupidly crowded with people picking up take out orders. Like people were almost leaning on our table. We didn't finish out food and packed the rest to go.   I don't think I'll be back...I've had far better food for the price. My parents weren't a fan of the food either."}
{"text":"A must have is the Bombay Chicken.  A little disappointed with the Pakoras."}
{"text":"Its close to work and often it is a choice of my co-workers.   However I'm not a fan of going here. The portions are small. The service is RUDE. Their choices aren't that spectacular. I've had their chili-chicken, Manchurian chicken, and hakka noodles..... which isn't that great.   All n' all  this restaurant isn't that great, however it is the closest thing to Hakka food around Overlea.   There are other Hakka places out there where their service is friendly and their portion size is worth it. I rather go there..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and this is one amazing Hakka restaurant in the city. Craving for indo Chinese I visited this place with a friend's recommendation and couldn't stop visiting again and again.                 Every time I visit this place I try something new taking recommendations from the staff which turned out to be excellent(obviously!! they would recommend the best ones ). But I am sure everything tastes good. I ask for recommendations because I am confused with their bigger menu.              I usually order fish or shrimp. Try their Bombay fish( ask it for hot), I bet u can't stop ordering it from your next visit. Their crispy chop suey is a must try dish too.       They have wide varieties of dishes and combos,specials   haven't tried many of those but definitely give it a try.      I would definitely give this place a five star for their authentic food. Who expects for the best service if you are entering a restaurant that delivers tasty food.     ******give this place a try, you won't be disappointed *****"}
{"text":"The food is Indian- Chinese style food and prepared in a delicious manner. The restaurant & restrooms are clean. However, the waitress has no smile, no welcoming words but a scowl on her face.  The veg stir fry Manchurian we ordered was extremely spicy. She never asked for our spice tolerance.  Many other Indian-Chinese places ask for spice levels & in the rare instances that it is forgotten the dishes are made mild as default.  When I mentioned this she argued with us. Whatever happened to accommodating the customer, apologizing for a mistake? This place doesn't care about customers.They also only give 1 fork - have to specifically ask for spoons?! Most people put up with this kind of treatment in Canada. Eventually such places close because of lack of customer treatment. I'm not sure if we will go here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Can't say enough about how good the food is.   Let's start by saying that the chicken pakoras are life changing.   The Manchurian chicken soup is amazing,  the Bombay fish is out of bounds great and if you go please try the tandoori chicken fried rice.  I'm hungry now,  hopefully I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hakka food! I was a little wary of coming here because of the other reviews but don't be. I ordered the shrimp pakora, crispy beef and singapore noodles and they were all ridiculously delicious. Food came out quickly and I had no issues with staff at all. Definitely worth coming here if you are in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good for take out only, not for dining. The food is spicy and there is a lot of demand for it. Service is slow but quick for take outs. The soup is bad (lots of starch), so give it a miss. The Bombay Fish is great but spicy. The noodles and fried rice are okay. The chicken lollipop is quite good and I could return just for that. Overall, not worth the hype but a good choice for take out if you want Hakka."}
{"text":"This place offers fast service during lunch time, and they are quite accommodating, even when my team at work comes in as a large group of 10-12. I'd only recommend if you're interested in spicy food, but the crispy beef and chilli green beans keep us coming back week after week."}
{"text":"2.5  Heard some things about this place so I decided to go give a whirl.  Hakka Garden is an OK place to go for Hakka, though i think you can do better.  Pros: Food is served fast  Cons: Food isn't exactly Hakka style IMO Prices are a bit higher than other Hakka places  I came here on a Sunday afternoon.  When you first walk in, the place really doesn't look like a restaurant at all.  It looks more like a fast food joint.  It's bare bones no frills decor.  You have tables and chairs, a couple of booths.  That's about it.  This place looks family run so my hopes were high after ordering.  We ordered the chili chicken, garlic beef and spicy green beans.  Unfortunately for me, my Hakka standards are very high.  The food here is OK, but nothing special.  The Chili Chicken was my fav of the 3 here.  Not too bad, but not spicy enough for sure.  Also, a little on the dry side in terms of sauce.  The garlic beef should be renamed salty beef.  That's basically what it tasted like.  The beans again were not spicy at all and more soy sauce-y than anything else.  It just didn't really have any Hakka taste to it that I'm used to.  It was still OK to eat, but it just didn't feel Hakka to me.  The prices are also what you would see downtown.  You're looking at $10 a dish here.  It's about the same prices as downtown but more expensive that Scarborough and Markham have to offer.  I don't mind the price if the food matches up but in this case it didn't.  This place is completely Halal which for them si good as it caters to the people living around the area.  Maybe that's the reason for the differnt tasting Hakka food?  Regardless, there are better options for Hakka."}
{"text":"Amazing food, courteous owner. I would specially recommend their Bombay Chicken."}
{"text":"Simply too good to resist! I had the garlic chicken, with egg fried chicken rice and it is simply the best! I also had the general tso chicken, but I thought the garlic chicken was better? If I remember correctly, it costs a dollar more too? We ordered these under a meal, in which we got wings for basically free! So that was neat! I had shrimp as well, and it's decent, their meals are better! Overall nice place to sit, decent food, decent price!"}
{"text":"I love all manner of fusion restaurant, and the \"Hakka\" Indo-Chinese styles really stand out for me. I've been going to the Hakka Garden since it opened a very long time ago and after a management transition a few years ago I had to write this review.  Firstly, this is one of those places that is completely packed after school/work hours and I rarely have the opportunity to even sit down anymore. The atmosphere is a little dim, but clean, and I suppose that goes with the length of time they've gone without redecorating. This place is very kid friendly, but everyone knows that's one of those good/bad things, considering the last thing I need is to hear some kid screaming while I'm trying to have a good time with some friends.  The food really is the star at this place, and in most cases if you ask for mild they'll take it easy on some things though it will be a bit spicy still. I've routinely found that a takeout order does take longer than some of the other places (roughly around 20 minutes) and sometimes service quality by the wait staff/cashiers is sorely lacking. Personally I think it's because they're overworked, but it could just be the transition of management styles over the last few years.   Recommendations:  -Manchurian Beef -Chicken Pakoras"}
{"text":"I went to my friends place in Toronto and ordered food from here. We were all craving for indo-chinese and turns out this place is pretty good.  Bombay fish- Amazingly awesome. Must try. Chilli chicken- Good Chicken fried rice- Good Chicken noodles- okay  Prices are little higher than the other chinese places."}
