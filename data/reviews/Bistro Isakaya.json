{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Montreal. Sushi is fresh and the appetizers are what make this place unique. Love the carpaccio and the Gobo Ten and don't forget the sushi with maple syrup."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place to my friends. What you get here is way overpriced so-called  \"Japanese\" food of mediocre quality and tiny quantity. 

I had the misfortune of going there because someone booked this place for a friend's birthday. It took almost an hour for the food to arrive after we placed the order, and when it did arrive, I couldn't believe how small the portion was. There was nothing special about the taste either, you can have similar stuff somewhere else for one third of the cost. 

By the end of it, my wallet was $35 lighter, and I left the restaurant still feeling hungry. 

Only in Montreal can Bistro Isakaya survive, it would have gone out of business many times over had it opened doors in Toronto, where many better and more reasonably priced Japanese restaurants are located."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday for my birthday!!!

wasn't my first time, and i ate so much... and a bit on the pricey side...

ok I don't think this place is very authentic Japanese, there might be some fusion at play here...

One dish I thought was interesting it the eel puff pastry pie with teriyaki sauce, which looks great on the menu, actual reality? bit sweet, original yet not as satisfying as you would think, different but not necessarily amazing...

The fish is fresh, but the sushi and rolls seem uninspired, nothing so good that you go crazy for...

they have chawanmushi, which is made with steamed egg lightly beaten egg with broth, and they put seafood and mushrooms in it, it's soft and warm, very soothing and mild, it might be too subtle for some. definitely an accustomed taste but i like it :)

The pop corn shrimp is tasty, lightly battered and fried coated with a light and spicy mayo sacue, delish.

The Lamb is very well executed, i asked for medium, and it was just right, and well caramelized with miso sauce, just right. Did I say i love miso?

Teriyaki chicken was a no no, really are we at a chinese take out window and odered chicken teriyaki? because that's what it tasted like...

The miso soup was exeptional, hit the spot for me, it is such a simple soup, but hard to pull off. This one as you sip it, the flavor develops depth where you sense other base ingredients coming through... for me that's good...

I would have given this place 4 stars, except it was more pricey than it's worth and the chicken teriyaki was unforgiveable, so yeah 3 stars :P"}
{"text":"Great sushi place,  lot of choice and good quality. 
Their ice cream (sesame, matcha ) are truly amazing.
I have been there twice already, never disappointed and staff is nice"}
{"text":"Located right on Park Avenue, the sushi is fresh and inventive.  And yes, they actually have Japanese making the sushi!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Fresh sashimi and seafood. Every time we come to this place we would certainly order sushi nigiri, specialty starters, and of course ramen noodle. I've been going to this place since 2002. Be aware that some choices on the menu, especially the teriyaki /tepanyaki main dishes are made for Caucasians. Food is always stable in its quality. 

Staffs are mainly Japanese."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn on Rue Sherbrooke and we're looking for something close by. As usual, I checked Yelp, and this spot came up.

We ordered a few rolls to share: spicy salmon (buttery and absolutely deeeelish), spicy tuna, and smoked salmon (different than the spicy salmon; this one had a smokey flavor and was served in a roll with just rice, wrapped in seaweed). Also shared a seaweed salad starter.

Ambiance was just OK, but wait staff was attentive and friendly, and it was surprisingly quiet for a Sunday evening. If we're even in this part of Montreal again, we'd come back to this spot. There are lots of interesting dessert options nearby as well."}
{"text":"ramen, black cod, salad, unagi. the Unagi was the best of the bunch (but it's hard to mess up). The rest were mediocre - I get the sense it was \"rushed\" - no real care taken - food came out bland. Certainly not a gourmet experience."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs bistro Japonnais de Montreal.

Je dois avouer qu'avant d'avoir l'avis d'une experte j'ai souvant été déçu par le Isakaya. Mais un jour la Lumière Fut!!!. Merci Yuriko J !!!

Les plats les plus autentiques sont écrit à la main sur une feuille photocopié recto-verso dans le menu. Le reste du menu est surtout composé de cuisine d'inspiration asiatique pour occidentaux.
Lors de ma dernière visite: gobo ten 6,75$, sashimi de petoncle sauce miso 8,50$, croquette de crabe 7$ et Udon Tempura 10,95$ ( j'avais faim!!! ) ....
Sashimi de péroncle: deux gros pétoncles frais servie avec une sauce onctueuse au miso légèrement vinaigrée, algues et mince tranche de concombre.MIAAAAM !
Udon tempura: la pâte a tempura qui recouvrait les 3 crevettes et les 3 légumes était savoureuse mais pas aussé croquante. Mais pour le reste parfait.
Croquette de crabe: savoureuse, onctueuse.... seul défaut elle sont trop petite.
Le gobo ten c'est un peu particulier. Certain aime d'autre non... moi j'aime!

Comme à mon habitude je fut au début systhématique.... savourant chaque élément un à un... et à la fin comme un enfant j'ai tous mélangé pour tous gouter en même temps. :)
Ledécor pourait franchement être rafraichi.
Le service lui est toujours exellent. Si votre serveuse ne parle pas français ne vous inquièté pas il y en a d'autres qui maîtrise la bête dans le Resto... juste à demander. 
En passant y a t'il quelqu'un qui peu m'expliquer pourquoi il y a un \"m\" à
la fin de faim ?

Pour ceux que ça intéresse!
Une des cerveuses est une véritable fan du Canadien. Et la je ne parle pas d'une serveuse qui fait l'interessé pour avoir plus de $$$ ...C'est une vrai fan. Elle connais les joueurs à son petit mots à dire sur les performance du CH....     
Lors de ma dernière visite le CH avait encore perdu :( .... mais la \"mon chou on s'en fou\" !"}
{"text":"Came here several times as a kid and decided to come back again to try. The menu hasn't changed much and the staff is still the same people. The fried calamari, tempura burdock roots and the chicken skin skewers (not on their regular menu. Ask for them) are still delicious. 

Very quiet japanese restaurant so it's a nice place to have a quiet meal with friends. The staff is always friendly and the food arrives quickly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years 
I love the authenticity of the food here
The food is consistently great
And the service is quite good if sometimes slow
If you're a small enough group I'd recommend sitting at the sushi bar
I always get the Gobo Ten (it's not on the English menu) and daifuku for dessert"}
{"text":"Had to check out the lunch special here after spin class one day and Id definitely be back. The place was busy, which is usually a good sign. Got a 10 piece combo and everything was tasty. I usually avoid leaving fate to the chefs hands with sushi combos but after what I got in this case, I'm feeling brave to do it again. In it I got kamikaze (Kari-kari, salmon, avocado) and spicy tuna (tuna and cucumber). Thank goodness my first sushi experience in Montréal was a great success!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in town. The burnt salmon is amazing and the owners are great."}
{"text":"We went out last night to celebrate the successful completion of a big project. I was honestly exhausted from staying up working the night before, and didn't have the energy to go very far for a nice meal. We debated between Italian and Japanese, and opted to go to Bistro Isakaya. 

Funny enough, I ended up sitting at the same table as last time, back in September. I was worried the small portions wouldn't be enough (we were quite hungry), so we ordered Chawanmushi (seafood egg custard), Age-dashi tofu (fried tofu in bonito broth), Age-nasu (fried eggplant in bonito broth), Tempura udon and Sushimori (plate of 16 sushi pieces). 

We started with complimentary miso soup and salad. The fried tofu, fried eggplant and egg custard came next. The dishes were small, but full of authentic and comforting flavors. The \"main\" dishes came last, although at this point we were decently satiated. The udon broth was very flavorful, but a tad too salty. Again, it wasn't a very big portion, but since we ate all those appetizers, it didn't matter. The sushi plate was nicely prepared and the seafood was fresh and well cut. The octopus had a particularly great texture. The total came to ~65$, which is not bad for 5 dishes (we shared everything). The pace of the dinner was well controlled, with dishes served once the previous ones were finished. A nice cup of green tea at the end would have been perfect.

I came to realise that Bistro Isakaya probably made a lot of compromises to satisfy a boad range of customers. It is expected that a Japanese restaurant serves sushi and ramen - but an \"izakaya\" is actually a place to drink, unwind and eat/share small tapas-like dishes. As it currently is, Bistro Isakaya's menu is a hybrid with traditionnal izakaya dishes and westernized \"main courses\". I guess it works out in the end, but the pricing suffered in consequence.

P.S. Love the Joe Hisaishi/Hayao Miyazaki soundtracks playing in the background."}
{"text":"For a Zagat rated restaurant it wasn't what I expected.  Although the food is authentic, it's a bit too homey for my style, and the atmosphere is quite shabby.  I don't know why, but I still haven't found any restaurant in Montreal that can properly preapare sushi rice.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive, and you will not go home hungry."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Atmosphere is warm relaxed. A good place for date night. Service is fast and friendly.

2. The food is delicious, but hurts the wallet! I'd have to say, I'd rather spend that dough at Kazu because their food is deemed better. 

3. You can get little Asian candies/chocolates at the cash on your way out. Which I definitely indulged in.

4. The one thing I loved the most was the strawberry mochi. MIAM!

CONS:
1. Expensive (Unless you get the Ramen) and portion sizes are teeny tiny. But quality over quantity right?

OVERALL:
-I would go back but It wouldn't be my first choice like Kazu.
-Get the strawberry mochi!"}
{"text":"I can say that the authenticity of the food here is top-notch. By 'food', I refer to all the seafood here. I am not sure I can testify the same level of authenticity for the ramen. I was tipsy when I walked in, so my immediate choice was a bowl of hot soup and noodles (among the best hangover foods). That meant either the udon or the ramen. I opted for the latter. For ramen, there are only two options: miso or shoyu. The shoyu was as hot as I wanted. Great! The vegetables were there. Great! The soup of good. Great! What was wrong then? Well, they did not give me enough noodles! Just for the record, I've been to a crazy amount of ramen shops in the Greater Vancouver region and Montreal, but this...this...was unacceptable. I felt like I was robbed a third of my money. Plus, the appearance of the soup did not look like the shoyu ramen at Misoya (a Japanese ramen restaurant on Rue Bishop that has sister restaurants in Tokyo).

Oyster was good, though I was only able to taste it for exactly a second (I ordered just one). $3 for each oyster. However, I had to question whether the lemon slice that came with it was fresh. 

I appreciated how the waitress asked whether we wanted tea or cold water right when we were seating ourselves. I replied \"tea.\" I loved how she made sure our teapot was always full. Tea, I feel, never disappoints me at any Asian restaurant. We weren't charged for the tea either! Yay!

The atmosphere was nice. If I had to summarize it in one word, it was cozy! Definitely felt like a mom and pop store. The floors were carpeted and the lighting had the same sort of tinge and brightness seen in some small kitchens of family homes. The chairs and sofas weren't the really fancy ones, but were comfortable. And comfort is what matters the most! 

I give it 3 stars mainly for small portions relative to the prices, not just for my ramen but for my friend's expensive plate of assorted sashimi (sashimimori), and the feeling that the lemon wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Food is only okay, but overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"We came here because our friends said this was the best Izakaya they've tried in Montreal (and one of the first to open). Unfortunately, I don't agree. The food is nothing more than ok and so is the service. You can find much better izakaya with nicer atmosphere than this one."}
{"text":"I went to Bistro Isakaya with my friend (although he didn't recommended it) but I still picked this place because I wanted to eat ramen. And this restaurant happened to be the closest ramen place around McGill University. I remember it was during finals, so we wanted to eat something near campus so we can go back to the library and this seemed to be the \"perfect\" place...

When we entered, there weren't many customers in the restaurant, which was a little bit odd because it was dinner time.. 

I don't remember what else they offered besides sushi and ramen since I have already made my mind before coming so I didn't pay attention to the other things on the menu. I picked their miso ramen and I was very very disappointed. The portion was small (I wished they have given more noodles) and the soup was pretty bland. I actually preferred Hakata Ramen (although their ramen is not authentic) to this place.

My ramen contained a piece of Naruto fish cake (also called Narutomaki), some bamboo shoots, a baton of carrot (which according to a website are \"Carrot sticks that are 2 to 3 inches long and 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch thick. This isn't an official restaurant cut, but useful for home cooks\"), green onions, seaweed, a lot of bean sprouts and a tiny piece of chashu.  

Conclusion, I will not return to Bistro Isakaya for this quality of ramen."}
{"text":"Food is on par. However, it is a little bit pricy for the quality. Good place to taste Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant in Montreal.  I have been eating here for over 10 years and the reason being as this is the most authentic Japanese sushi restaurant I have eaten at in Montreal.  The decor is not the best however, the quality of fish is very fresh and you can tell the chefs at this restaurant take pride in the food they serve. The miso soup is the best I have had in the city, so tasty yet so simple. The salad that comes with most meals is always fresh and the dressing on the salad makes you crave it until you eat it a next time. Order the black cod, it will be cooked to perfection and it will melt in your mouth. When in season, order the uni (sea urchin).  I was extremely skeptical to try this but when I first did I was hooked. When I see it on other restaurants I always order it but it never tastes as good as it does from Isakaya. Another favourite of mine is the grilled squid. 

When I crave sushi, this is the best it gets! Try it."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here several months ago and ate here with the family just last weekend. A very nice Japanese restaurant for the area. It's a bit pricey from what I remember but the food is pretty worth it. Service was very slow though and there is one waitress there who I don't particularly like. She seems very grumpy with an attitude. But nevertheless, I refused to allow that to stop me from enjoying my meal and good time. I had the salmon shogayaki and it was fantastic. It's a great place for a date as well for all you lovebirds out there."}
{"text":"Isakaya is a hit ans miss kind of place. I've been here quite a few times and I have to say that 80% of the time the food is awesome but every now and then I've had so so food. I think this maybe when to cook has a day off or is on vacation.

Isakaya is a family run restaurant most of the wait staff and kitchen staff are related giving it a nice ambiance. You may not feel the family vibe the first time you go but once you go two or three times you'll start to feel it. 

I find the sushi to be good, not the best ever but very good. The dishes I prefer here are the unagi pie and the black cod. If you happen to come on a day when the main cook is on duty then you wont be disappointed. To tell the truth it's worth taking the chance because even if you don't go on a day when the main chef is in the food will still be pretty good.

Isakaya is worth a try."}
{"text":"I don't normally write bad reviews but this place was TERRIBLE. I will never go back even though I live in the neighbourhood and love sushi. 

SERVICE: SHIT. They sat us at the back of the restaurant. Guess what happened? YUP. The servers ignored us. AFTER 20 MINUTES OF BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED, we left to a different table and finally grabbed a server's attention to PLACE THE ORDER. NEXT: ALMOST 1.5 HOURS LATER, our order hasn't arrived yet.  After feeling really frustrated about the wait, we asked one of the servers what happened to our food, she walked into the kitchen and walked out a minute later ONLY TO COMPLETELY IGNORE US AND DEAL WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY AND SHE NEVER GOT BACK TO US ABOUT OUR FOOD. 

AFTER WAITING ALMOST TWO HOURS FOR OUR FOOD, IT FINALLY ARRIVED. Guess what? IT WAS THE MOST DREADFUL SUSHI we had ever eaten. The sushi had a snot texture to it and tasted like plastic. THE FISH TASTED LIKE IT HAD SWAM IN A SEWER INSTEAD OF THE OCEAN. Definitely not fresh. 

To make matters worse, not too long after I HAD THE RUNS. 

DID I mention how expensive this place is? TOTALLY OVERPRICED. I don't mind paying a little extra for a nice meal, but for diarrhea? 

Bistro Isakaya
Shit service. Overpriced food. Guaranteed diarrhea.
My grandma can make better sushi than these guys. AND SHE'S DEAD."}
{"text":"Don't go there. The food is not bad, but it is waaaayy overpriced and the menu doesn't have much selection. You can spend  more than $35 on average Japanese food here and not even be full. For example, the crab cake is $7 and only comes with two small patties."}
{"text":"We have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants around the world and I have to say that this place is only average... The prices are high compared to other places I have been to (although I don't know how expensive it compares to other Japanese places in Montreal) and the food is only so-so. We ordered off the lunch special, I got a lamb on rice dish and my boyfriend got a chicken teriyaki. There were only 2 small strips of lamb and the rice tasted as if someone dumped an entire container of ground pepper on it... The chicken teriyaki looked like boiled chicken breast with an entire bottle of teriyaki sauce dumped on it... The lunch dishes came win either miso soup or salad or noodle soup and dessert. We picked the salad and it was nothing special, the dessert was just fruits soaked in sugar water..."}
{"text":"I've eaten  here twice and have had the best sashimi that I've had anywhere in Montreal.
Order whatever they have on the Specials board and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Sashimi was good and fresh. But Ramen and Udon were really disappointing. Not worth the money."}
