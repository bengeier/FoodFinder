{"text":"How the fuck did this place get so many high reviews is beyond my ability for reason. Hastily made crappy all around, and the drivers are just as dumb. I ordered through GrubHub even left a generous tip, I could have shit a better pizza. I will never ever order from these fuckers again it's just crap."}
{"text":"got carry out from here yesterday - just an overall meh. the slice of pizza I received was luke warm at best, and tasted probably less exciting then your average freezer pizza. also had a meatball sub which was quite lame too, sauce was extremely chunky yet lacked flavor, sub was also lacking sauce, with only a small dribbling. overall disappointed, if you're getting pizza, save your money and go to little ceasars just across the street."}
{"text":"I've been going to the relatively new location on Rural Rd just south of Broadway in Tempe. Great food and hours of operation. I stop by coming home from work after 10pm. Been there 4 times. 1st visit I had Eggplant Parmesan. 2nd visit I had the Maya Sonoran Style Hotdog and a slice of Mushroon Pizza. 3rd visit , I took the advice of co-owner Omer and ordered from the Mediterranean Cuisine section of the menu the Kofta Plate with Jalapeno Hummus and Tabouleh as my sides. Fantastic! The Tabouleh is Turkish style which is slightly different than the Lebanese version of which I am accustomed. It was terrific! Came with warm pita bread. On my 4th visit, I had the Maya's New York Italian Sub. Fantastic! Great meats, veggies, bread and dressing! Sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on it. YUM! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from GrubHub, delivery was a little late but that was cool since it was pretty far away. Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak, flavor was great. Just wish for Christmas I would have got more cheese whiz on the top of the sandwich. :("}
{"text":"pretty terrible. ordered delivery through grub hub for a chicken kabab meal with two sides and penne bolognese with garlic bread. the pasta was not bad but they forgot the ranch side salad with it and had to come back to deliver it. the garlic bread was dry and had burned corners. 

the chicken kabab meal was pretty gross. the chicken itself was okay once microwaved but the pita bread was soggy due to being placed right next to the chicken. the tabouli and Greek salad were like something out of a bad comedy movie. the tabouli was not tabouli, see picture. I'm still trying to figure out what the orange pieces on it were. I tried some and it just tasted like slightly pickled cucumbers and tomatoes. the Greek salad had no dressing but did have melted cheese on top. 

if you can, (I'm aware of the limited amount of decent delivery food places in tempe) avoid this place. or at least don't order the salads or tabouli. you've been warned."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took an extra long time despite not living far from it. When the delivery driver got to my door, she regretted to inform me that whatever sauce there was in my bag, she accidentally spilled inside. To make matters more annoying, she didn't bring proper change to break my $20 bill so I ended up tipping much more than I wanted.  And to add insult to injury, the food just did not taste good."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today and It was extremely delicious!! The chicken parm pasta is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love the lentil soup and the pizza is really good. The  delivery was really fast, I got my order in less than 30 min even though I live more than 3 miles away."}
{"text":"This place is very clean, the service is proper. Antioch pizza is awesome. Will definitely go againto try other menu items."}
{"text":"The Antioch pizza is just amazin! Omar makes awesome pizza. The service and staff is great. Would highly recommend this place for pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The crust was light and thin but not too crisp. The New York style cheesecake is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Ordered in last night via GrubHub.. The chicken Caesar wrap was pretty good. The side salad was really nice - thoughtfully constructed, I'd say. 
The other order was chicken kebab, with rice and a side salad. It was so good I didn't get a taste of it.. And it disappeared.  
We also ordered some hot wings. They were really good, and very hot (temp) upon delivery. 
All in all, this place is worth a second visit.
I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"7/5/15
Maya's New York Pizza and Grill was all around a horrible experience! ! If I could give them no stars, I would have, so 1 star by flaw of no other option. 
First time customer ordered off grubhub.
 No problems with Grubhub! 
We normally don't order food because it's too expensive ordering for 6, but wanted something easy for tonight.
We ordered at 745pm email comfirmation said delivery by 8:45 - 8:55.
 Ordered pep pizza, hot wings, sampler,and 2 orders of fries = 1 hr wait time on a Sunday night. After calling place 2x for eta /Order arrived 9:25. 

 Pizza was cardboard. Wings were bland, and gross.
Sampler- chicken strips were over cooked so they were hard, onion rings and fried zucchini were soggy not crunchy. 
French fries were soft and soggy. 
I had to make my kids food on top of waiting for the food. 
Called and expressed concerns, guy was nice and offered to refund $ had to run it by Mgr and would call us back. Never called back we called him back. He said in order to refund they had to pick up the food. We said fine, but no one ever showed up to pick up the food. They didnt answer when we tried to call.
I'll never order from the company again. 47.00 down the drain.
***update***  7/6/15
We were able to contact someone today at Mayas New York Pizza they apologized immensely for the service even offered to remake it and send it out today and explained in order to get a refund we would have to go through GrubHub spoke to GrubHub and after they confirmed with pizza place we were given a refund. Based upon the person that I spoke to today we may give them a second chance."}
{"text":"No lunch specials should have been my 1st red flag.   I tried this place out because it was closer than the pizza place I normally go to.  -2 slices & drink at almost $9 bucks later I was left with only disappointment.  The pizza was bland, mushy, greasy, barely warm and tasted like microwave pizza.  I literally ate a frozen Walmart pizza later that night to make up for horrible pizza experience from this place.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, they forgot half of the order. 
Tried to call them to TELL them that half my order was missing - they didn't answer. Had to call 20 times until they picked up. 
And the food wasn't worth the price. 
SMALL portions, lacking flavor, not fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Bravo! This is what you need on a Wednesday night after a long day. The ambiance is great. Pizzas great. Price is great. Overall, I am very satisfied with the whole ensemble bringing a bit of New York to Tempe, Arizona. 

Recommended frugal menu 
A slice of cheese pizza for 2.50$"}
{"text":"Pizza is definitely not NY style. Soft crust not crisp like NY pizza. Mediocre pizza at best.  Crust tastes like frozen pizza crust. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Nasty! Cold pizza! Rude staff!! I have tried the tempe and mesa location. They have no manners at all. And they advertise New York style. New York style what??? Not their pizza. If you have even been to New York and had pizza the pizza here is like pizza from the dumpster."}
{"text":"I am giving this 3 stars because of inconsistency in the pizza. I have ate from here around 10 times and half the time its good and the other time its mediocre except for the last time which might have been the worse pizza I have had in a long time. I would go with Clockwork Pizza or even Final Round before this spot because of that."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is open until 4am on the weekends and is right across the street from me. Seriously life changing. I chatted with the staff for a while. They were very friendly and thus I will not be adverse to coming back here.

This place is absolutely adorable inside. A drastic improvement from the last place that was there. It even looked clean... weird.  There are also some outdoor tables;. I can picture it now, me, my dog, and a pizza, sitting in the nice fall weather enjoying some delicious pizza in the sunlight. Or more likely, a nice study spot I can go to for a quick bite while my dog randomly barks at passerby.

As for the food, I didn't take to much of a risk here. I mean, it's right across the street from me and having a negative first experience would just be bad for everyone. They had a pretty diverse menu and I look forward to trying some of the Mediterranean items on my next visit. For this time, I went totally boring status and ordered a peperoni pizza and fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was up to standards, which is good, I don't expect anything different from my fried zucchini. The pizza was quite tasty. I'd eat it a lot. I mean, quite probably, I will eat it a lot."}
{"text":"Put simply?  Everything I ordered from here clearly came out of a box , can, or the freezer.  To top it all off, the delivery guy was 30 minutes late.  I ordered Hummus + the Kofta plate and my two sides were rice and tabouleh.

Hummus: the only edible part of the meal - it was nothing special, I was just hungry.

Kofta: clearly pre-packaged and frozen initially, the chef was kind enough to char the outside black while keeping the ground beef raw and pink on the inside.  I wouldn't feed this to a dog.

Rice: Go get a box of Uncle Ben's minute rice and you've made 1/3 of this meal already.

Tabouleh: I don't know what that stuff is, but calling it tabouleh is tantamount to perjury.

I guess this is what I get for trying to go \"cheap\" ($18 for this SH*T?!?!) with \"mediterranean\" cuisine.  They get two stars because....maybe their pizza is better?  I'm not gonna bother to find out."}
{"text":"I ordered tonight via Grubhub; Maya mixed grill, tabbouleh, pita and tzatziki.

Pros:
-The kofta was excellent
-The portion size was good, it was a large meal but no so crazy that a lot went to waste, which I've found is often the case when I order
- The girl who delivered my food was polite and quick and she came to the door; too often I've had drivers call me from the lot wanting me to come down so they don't have to find my building, which is a pain in the ass when I'm working.
- The tabbouleh was very fresh and light, excellent.

Cons:
- The chicken and lamb were both a bit dry and tough, not tender.
- I substituted a side for pita bread and tzatziki; the tzatziki was a bit small, I'd have expected two containers, and wasn't enough for the pita bread.

I'd order again."}
{"text":"Worst place I have been in Tempe. The pasta had enough grease to fry an egg. The pizza was hours old. Shouldn't even have been served. My two slices had enough cheese for one Ritz, ok maybe 3-4 crackers, but omg. I pointed this out and he basically shrugged. I would love to find a new pizza place as an alternative to Oreganos... Sals was it, but they have gone down too."}
{"text":"I love this place, i work in an office down the street and they are the go to people when it comes to ordering people and getting fast delivery"}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza, but when I visit this place I am getting addicted to pizza again, so pizza is very good. Also, you can get discount if you go there with your friends!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum!
Order online thru Grub Hub @ lunch time.
Told me it would be an hour + (normal for this business area & it's lunch time).
But the driver showed up within 1/2 hour!
The Bronx Bomber was GOOD........
This 1 is saved in my favorites!!"}
{"text":"So amazing. We got the Maya special but added mushrooms and had red sauce instead of olive oil. So yummy!  Def get the ricotta cheese because they flavor it!"}
{"text":"i had some chicken wings and garlic knots pretty good will wait a few weeks before i get a pizza and then ill update"}
{"text":"When the chef is challenging himself to do better each and every time, you gotta stop that place more often. I happen to visit them plenty of times already and I really enjoyed what I've ordered so far. 
The place is clean and they have very rich menu. Due to your taste, you can order pizza or wraps as well as pasta and some Mediterranean dish. My priority at newly opened places is their attitude rather than \"perfection\", because I believe it is more of a process rather than a moment. 
They are very friendly and eager to please the customer. I strongly recommend their pizzas which are kind of unique and really worth to try. If you are looking for a better pizza place with high standards, stop by sometime, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yes! A new pizza place near my house! I must investigate... 

This is where Jamie's Pizza and Pita used to be. It looks a lot different inside now. It's much more clean and simple (Jamie's wasn't so much dirty as it was cluttered). This is the second location for Maya to open up this year. I hadn't heard of it before driving by today on my way home.

I ordered a 12\" pepperoni and sausage pizza to take home. It was hand-made and ready pretty quick. The crust is thin and crispy on the outside - almost like a cracker bread. Toward the middle, it's softer. There was a good balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The pepperonis were spicy and flavorful, the sausage was good, and the sauce was solid NY style. Other than that, it didn't really strike me as NY style pizza that much. I actually preferred it to a NY pizza. It's more of an Arizona style really. The way the crust came out - it almost seemed like a wood-fired pizza even though I know it wasn't.

Overall, it was mighty tasty and I enjoyed every bite. They have an extensive menu which I haven't had a chance to explore yet, but so far so good.

They deliver and are only a few miles from my house, so I'm obviously going to be ordering from here a lot (as long as it stays consistently good). I like that the guy who made my pizza was wearing a chef's jacket. A+++ would order from again."}
{"text":"Fabulous find for pizza delivery!!!! We ordered the Maya Special, Veggie Explosion, and a pepperoni-black olive-mushroom pizza, as well as french fries and onion rings.  Everything was fantastic!  I have to admit, it wasn't the big greasy pizza we normally associate with \"ny\" pizza--which turned out to be a good thing!  The crust is thin and crisp and the pizzas weren't greasy at all.  We actually feel good after eating it, rather than heavy and weighed down.  This is pizza as it should be!!!!  The pizzas bursted with flavor from the fresh ingredients!!!  I wasn't expecting the Maya Special to be so flavorful, since there's no sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised!!!!  The onion rings are superb and even the french fries had wonderful flavor.  We will definitely be ordering again!!!!  This is our new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.. Waited an hour and 15 min for me food.. Spent 5 minutes on the phone trying to tell the driver where to go and eventually I decided to meet him at the office.. Walked down to the office and he wasn't there.. Called him and he told me he had to just cancel the order"}
{"text":"Seriously misled by the yelp reviews and rating. Did everyone eat the same pizza I had? Because it was awful. I would rather eat Little Caesar's terrible pizza puck for a quarter of the price with double the flavor, and a bagged salad from Safeway. 

Ordered the Bronx Bomber with a bunch of meats, all really low quality. Giant rectangles of squeaky ham squares marbled with big visible veins of fat should have been a cut to a quarter of that size (and wouldn't hurt to order up from your meat dealer, because when you buy low the taste reflects that). Meatballs tasted old with an odd mealy texture and metallic tang that dominated the flavors and left a terrible lingering aftertaste. Sausage rounds were forgettable. Pepperoni was okay but flabby and not crispy, like everything on the pizza. And it's not because the toppings were packed to tight, that's for sure. Weird crust too, bland and floury with zero flavor and no rise. Despite the flabby toppings and cheap cheese, the crust was somehow burned too? All for the low, low price of $17!

Got an antipasto salad too with the house dressing, couple handfuls of romaine lettuce for $6 with salami, more awful ham I discarded, pepperoni, provolone, and onions. Again everything was chopped way too big. Don't get the house dressing either. All oil and dried spices. 

I was super excited to have a new pizza joint five minutes from my house, but that excitement was misplaced. Tossed the leftovers."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch not long after they opened for the day and put in an order for a meatball sub and a slice of pizza. The sub tasted ok but the bread was toasted so hard it was nearly inedible and the slice of pizza was about as New York as a cactus. The soda fountain was also out of ice and dispensing flat, warm soda and it felt like the AC wasn't on, which during the summer is an absolute mistake. It was cooler outside than it was inside. Also it took about a half hour to get the food. The only good thing about the place was the gentlemen working the counter were nice. I hope it was just a really off day."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last have a review, and I think a pizza place such as this is worthy of review.  It's open till midnight, has great prices, and even sells pizza by the slice.  The dining area was clean, which is always an encouraging sign.  The service was fantastic.  It takes more than just a pretty face to get me to keep coming back, and her customer service skills were impressive to say the least.  I do believe that I might have found a pizza place that I can keep cooking back to again and again"}
{"text":"PIzza was good.  Delivery was slow.  Delivery driver didn't know how long it took, expressed surprise when I told him it was over an hour, and then he dropped a container of ranch dressing on my front porch. It exploded. He looked at it, said \"oops\", shrugged his shoulders, and left.  I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Fast, on time, and the guy was extra patient as I couldn't find my wallet. 

The pizza was very delicious. I got the veggie delight. The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I like the quality over other veggie pizzas from joints in the area, their sauce wasn't caked on. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our pizza and will be returning."}
