{"text":"Great pizza, horrible service.  Our group had 3 families.  2 of our families got food within a short time, the third family waited over 45 minutes for their food.  No explanation or apology from management, just excuse after excuse."}
{"text":"I ordered this pizza while visiting Madison for work. This is the best pizza I have ever had! And the delivery was very fast too."}
{"text":"Just saw some ridiculous driving from one of the delivery cars. It was a SILVER FORD TAURUS with Rocky Rococo top driving during rush hour(5pm September 21st 2012) on University ave(campus area), cutting all the vehicles off, driving on the bike lane and changing lanes like crazy(from right to left). I thought he was drunk, maybe he was- who knows..."}
{"text":"Whole wheat crust a must! I agree with an earlier reviewer that the white crust is gross. Trust me, it is a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Let me be the first to say that this place has unappetizing food. 

The pizza slices I've had from here (tried on 3 separate occasions before I decided to write this review) were terrible. The crust was soft soggy because of the grease, the pepperoni and sausage slices were unsavory, and the breadsticks I had were under seasoned.

Overall, it's cheap and fast and that's a big draw for most people, but why would I eat here when I would rather go to the McDonald's on Mills and Regent or any other place that doesn't have grease as a main ingredient for their pizza slices. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid.  Pizza has always sucked.  Cheap and greasy with an abundance of uncooked dough to make up for the meager toppings.  Best thing going for it is the cup of sauce to dip your nearly sauce-less slice in.  Still I go every few months when I get a hankering, and then I am disappointed and sick afterwards."}
{"text":"I used to live right next to the regent st. location.  It was a good place to get some good pizza.  They always had some coupon or deal in the onion so I'd go here once or twice a month."}
{"text":"I have been to Rocky Rococo at their State Street location on at least 25 occasions, generally ordering a deep dish style slice of sausage pizza.  I like the sweet flavor, and one does not have to be a culinary Sherlock Holmes to realize that part of the secret for the yummy quality is just adding more sugar to the dough.  The combination of pork and sugar is common, as it is found in canned pork and beans, breakfast sausages with maple syrup, and various recipes for ham.  The cardboard box is a slight twist on the usual way of serving individual slice pizza, and the use of the box makes it seem that your single slice is not just a \"left over,\" but a meal prepared just for you.   The ultimate in deep dish pizza is not Rocky Rococo's, but, e.g., Zachary's in Berkeley, California."}
{"text":"Deep dish, thick crust, cheesy, saucy, sloppy pizza.  You're damn right.  Beats the hell out of Ian's flat, sauceless, steamroller pizza.  If I want mac and cheese, I'll buy a box of it for 99 cents at the grocery store.  Rocky's is the only pizza I've ever had that has good sausage - it's real chunks of sausage, not the little rabbit turd sausage balls.

Tip: go here for slices before the Badgers football games - they have a ton of them ready, and they're a helluva lot better than the gross 73% \"lean\" frozen burgers and undercooked brats that are served at the tailgates and in the stadium.  Lines aren't long and you get your food quickly."}
{"text":"It was my first time experiencing pizza in Rocky Rococo's and the food was delicious. I liked the service because the employees are friendly. The extra cheesy super sausage is delicious and the price was affordable. I tried the Original Chicago and Meatworks and I loved the extra cheesy the most! 
Thanks Rocky Rococo for such a hearty pizza meal!"}
{"text":"You can count on a doughy, terrible, undercooked, greasy pizza unless you get the whole wheat crust. They make pizza on a  chain conveyor belt like Burger King does. You can't get  a good crust without an oven. They could care less as employee s can't burn pizza and this saves money and time. But if you get the whole wheat crust it turns out great! They have a good sauce and awesome sausages. Order a wholewheat Uncle Sal's and you will thank me. Plus you can feed 6 big people easily!"}
{"text":"I have a love/love/hate relationship with Rocky's. It's become part of my Madison routine to occasionally drive into their tiny mini-mall and grab a motherlode slice and then a donut from Greenbush. It's one of those \"only in Madison\" things everyone should try once.

Their pizza is soft, doughy, sugary, strange, spicy, greasy, puffy, icky, and delicious. It's the kind of food you eat after a long hard day when you just don't give a *$%# anymore. And you enjoy it - a lot. Especially if you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to dip your liquid-smoke-flavored-cheese-crust into. 

There's really nothing like Rocky Rococo's anywhere. It's one of those weird things in Wisconsin that become addictive. I even take visitors and tourists here. And they always leave confused and happy. 

Great for people watching too. Pay attention for locals trying to eat healthy with a tiny salad covered in five pints of creamy salad dressing while longly looking at their friends' pizza, which probably has lower calories per serving."}
{"text":"Alright, listen. I love Rocky Rococo. I grew up in the area and grew up eating this pizza from a young age. It's great, you know what you are getting. Its comfortable. This all being said, if you take a step back, the quality is really pretty questionable. And the advertising is so bizarre (in a good way!), my fiance from Ohio will take pictures and send them to friends out of state for them to marvel over. Rocky's is a weird place. It is what it is, and in my opinion, what it is is delicious. We never order this pizza for dinner, but I'll come for lunch every so often. Haters gonna hate. I think if you grew up eating here, you probably love it. If not, it's a mixed bag. 

Also fwiw I had cravings for this pizza when I lived in Colorado. I think that says more about me than Rocky Rococo."}
{"text":"Yikes, extremely soggy pizza and my order was missing an item. Tasted like grade school microwaved pizza."}
{"text":"OK, a key to getting decent pizza here (assuming you walk-in) is to go while they are busy. If you go during off peak times your pizza will not be fresh since it's under heat lamps.
I will fully admit that part of the appeal to me is that I used to love this stuff when I was a kid.  If you want to go here to eat in, check the coupon mailings sent to Madison households as they usually have Rocky's coupons.  The regent locations has deals for slices and breadsticks after 8PM. The \"Party Pizzaria\" locations are nicer, with better decor, newspapers, games, etc.  And of course, if you order a full pizza rather than a slice, your pizza will be fresher than being under a heatlamp."}
{"text":"It's amazing that since the 90's, Rocky's has not changed their business model or overhauled their menu.  The same choices of pizza by the slice.  In a pinch (which is why we were there) Rocky's is fine but by no means is it a place that I would purposely plan to go.  Generic sauce.  Crust on the verge of being undercooked.  Interior worn and dated."}
{"text":"I keep trying Rocky's every few years because it's a Madison institution, but it's just not for me. It's not gross or anything, but it's also not great. 

We ordered delivery on a lazy night because they had a decent special for a medium pizza and cheese sticks for $14.99. My boyfriend likes Rocky's so I jumped on to give it another try. 

The upside is that pizza from Rocky's will fill you up. It's pan-style pizza and its doughy and heavy. The flavor overall is on the sweet side. My half of the pizza fed me for three meals, which isn't too shabby for my $8 half of the bill. 

The one thing I actually don't mind from Rocky Rococo's is the breadsticks. They're a cheap and decent snack when you're craving carbs. The cheese sticks fared better for me than the pizza. They had a fairly good punch of garlic and the super soft dough worked with the sturdier layer of cheese. 

I understand why this has been on campus since before I was a student - you can get a good amount of filling food for cheap. As an adult with some disposable income, though, I'll take my order up a notch with some of the other pizza places in town."}
{"text":"What can you say about Rockys. Were from Rockford and they closed back in the 90s. Whenever we go do Madison Rockys is on the list of must go places."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison for a work trip we were busy working away and nearly missed lunch, however our vendor decided to call in pizza and making it a working lunch. The pizza arrived fast and fresh, the pizza was good however it almost reminded me of a deep dish from Little Caesars. It was your typical pan style pizza, cut into squares. Nothing stood out about this pizza so I have to admit that I would probably skip right over Rocky Rococo on my next trip to town."}
{"text":"I was here twice on a National Tour with a musical, and I can say, hands down, that Rocky's is the best pizza I had while crossing through 43 states!  Amazing taste at an amazing price!"}
{"text":"We love Rocky's. They burnt our pizza which we didn't look at till we got home. They promptly corrected the problem, and very graciously I might add. We even received a hand written note from the corporate office apologizing as well as a letter from the store in which they took total responsibility for the issue. I give them 6 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"This is not pizza. This is bread with sauce on top. Just go to the supermarket, get some bread and tomato sauce and slather it on - done. Gross, don't do it. Get Ian's instead."}
