{"text":"My go to place for dim sum.The prices are reasonable, service is fine and food is good. If you're  going for dim sum I highly recommend trying their dumplings."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. We ordered four dishes, we ordered fish the first time. The waiter came back and said they were sold out of fish, we switched to chicken, they came back and said they are out of chicken, but had free range chicken. So we order that, but then someone else came back and said they were out of that as well. I'm not sure what kind of business they are running, but the staff should know what they have and don't have. it's not rocket science. We finally order another pricier fish. If they would have told us they had another fish available in the first place we would have just ordered that instead of going back and forth 3 times. Also, when we got out dessert they didn't give us any forks. The waiter just placed a dish on the table and walked away. He looked half asleep. Save your money and don't eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place! My family and I love coming to this restaurant whenever we want seafood dinner!  The presentation and quality of food is great!  It is also cheaper than the east side equivalent (Fishmans Wharf)"}
{"text":"Finally an amazing seafood restaurant in Mississauga. The interior decor is very nice, service is excellent. Servers took the time to explain each meal and questions we had. The taste is fabulous - the sauces aren't too overwhelming,  so you can still taste the natural seafood flavors."}
{"text":"Food - We ordered 4lb lobster and all other dishes (not really sure what the exact name is), everything was fresh and good. Its on the pricey side especially with the lobster. The cook will come out to show and tell you the weight of the uncooked lobster. Not that it makes a difference when its cooked cos who's to say they put all of the 4lbs there?. I must say the plating is very impressive.  Service and Ambiance - Its more elegant than other chinese restaurant, the service was good and the servers were attentive.  We also tried the all dimsum  for our 2nd visit. The price is at 2.60 for all dimsum fbefore 11am. The place was packed at around 10AM on a saturday."}
{"text":"Not great!  Yes, it's decked out with Asian flair, but this review is all about the food.    I came in with high expectations, given that the Chinese elder of the group was really keen to take us here.  In the end though, the flavors were lack-luster.  The dim-sum is rated on the basics.  And it was was 3/5  I've had better sui mai and har gow.  BBQ pork buns were so sweet.  Taro root cake was lacking salt.  At least the sticky rice and veggies were prepared well.  After hours of egg tart highlights from my uncle, I was persuaded to try one out to find it dry, overly sweet, and lacking that classic egginess an egg tart should have."}
{"text":"i have came here for so many times, the last two experiences were nightmares. i found two metal wires from dish washer brush inside two different stuffing food. today, i found a fried human hair from my fried octpus. the worest part is, the menager was trying to convience me that's not a hair, and still chanrge me. I AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED! they have so many customers, I am worried about their safety, PLEASE BE AWARE AND CAREFUL WHEN YOU COME TO THIS RESTAURANT. I WILL REPORT TO THE Toronto Public Health and request a safety check to this restaurent."}
{"text":"Really delicious dim sum and affordable! I come here quite often with my family and I must say their dim sum is on par with the good ones in Toronto. I was skeptical at first when they opened..but the price and quality surprised me."}
{"text":"Poor service. Long wait for food. Raw lobster. Will I be back, not a chance. Save your money drive to Markham fisherman's clubhouse"}
{"text":"I'd like to comment in the food but after ordering dim sum 45 mins ago, I have yet to even smell a dish nearby. We asked if our order had been processed, and to our surprise, the reply was \"I can't answer your question\". Wtf?"}
{"text":"I have been to a few dim sum places in China town which are good but filthy! This one beats the China town ones for sure. To start off, the place is clean with a lot of seating. The dim sums are yummy and at par if not better tasting than China town. The weekday happy hour is till 11am and weekend it is till 12noon. Service is quick and to the point. I have never had to wait for a dish for more than 5-10 min after being initially seated. However they do take a long time to finally get you the check. All in all a great place for Chinese food if you live in the area."}
{"text":"The decor is nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  This review is for dinner.  The presentation of the food was fairly decent but it was downhill from there. The peking duck was small and fatty when we had asked for leaner duck. We had one of the standard combos and nothing particularly stood out (seafood bird's nest, sauteed fish on celery/green beans, sauteed beef, lobster, crab). The worst part is that the food had way way too much MSG. Everybody in my party was drinking a ton of water afterwards.  There were a few nice touches like getting gloves to eat the seafood, though the gloves leaked. And they gave us taro dessert soup, which wasn't overly sweet, instead of the standard red bean soup in many Chinese restaurants.  I still can't get over the amount of MSG used in their food in this day and age. There are simply too many other Chinese restaurants in the GTA where this doesn't happen or is used more sparingly. I will not go back."}
{"text":"1 star given on the merit that the venue looks somewhat respectable. Horrible service, bad food, and unreasonably busy for something that doesn't make sense in terms of price vs quality. We actually had to question what dim sum dish is being served as everything looks grey. Would not return."}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum. One of the best I've had. It is on the high end of Dim Sum with the prices. There is special pricing for S M L items if you go before 11am M-F at the moment (for the opening).  The food is dim sum with a modern twist. There are no trolleys in this place. The service was a little slow. It took an hour for all our food to come. We ordered 7 items."}
{"text":"This Seafood Restaurant has garnered so much attention, and love for Mississauga China Town! Honestly, I've driven by so many times, and I was sooooo curious as to why there were suddenly so many cars (and so little parking spots available) in the plaza recently.  Now I finally understand the hype of Blue Lagoon!   Stepping in, this restaurant is literally gorgeous.  With high ceilings, and chandeliers, the dining experience was one I did not expect! Overall ambience was terrific!  We had a table of 13 so the combos were waaaayyy too expensive for us.  A combo for 10 people was ~$999 so we decided to order single dishes instead.  The food was better than I expected as well.  It wasn't anything over the top special, but the quality was better than what you usually get from Chinese restaurants in Mississauga.  Also, portions were good, and well worth the money.    Service was pretty good.  One of our lady servers was a bit pushy though, and we felt pressured to quickly order.  They all speak better than decent english, so there was no language barrier.  In addition, they have a nice system of having receipts on the table for the items ordered kinda thing, but I wish it was in english as we didn't know what was what.    Overall, this restaurant had fairly decent food, and service.  It's one of the shops keeping this plaza alive imo! I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum especially considering the place is big.  Hence the wait time on weekends aren't that bad.    Two issues and they are particularly important to those with children; once we went for Sunday dim sum and they ran out of high chairs.  Luckily the table next to us wasn't using theirs so they gave it to us.   Had our neighbors not been so kind I would not be a happy dim summer.    Secondly, there is no change table in the washroom.  Imagine a place that seats hundreds but they forgot to install a change table.  Tsk tsk.    So go forewarned parents of little kids...."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good comments about this place and how much cheaper they are compared to all other dim sum places is Mississauga and they also offer free tea which is a plus.  So I took my family there one Friday morning.  Ok...agreed the place looked quite nice and there was plenty of tables so no wait time.  The server asked what kind of tea we wanted so I asked for \"goke po\", which has chrysanthemum flower in it.  We also ordered a bunch of things and they came quite fast too.  So far so good.  The food I thought was ok but not as delicious as places in Markham.    Now, their sign says free tea and guest what, they charged me for the tea!!!  So then I asked why.  The server told me I had ordered a special tea and I said why didn't anyone tell me that there will be a charge for this tea in the first place cause not everyone will know that.  So she asked her manager to come over to speak to me.  The manager said she had told me when I ordered...uhmmm you just lied right in front of me!  I did not even see her when we came in so when did she ever spoke to me.  Anyway it was just silly, I didn't want to argue over $2 charge but I just wanted to make a point.  That was not professional at all."}
{"text":"I rarely venture out to Mississauga to eat, but we were here for family Chinese new year's eve dinner and I was absolutely amazed as soon as I walked through the front door.  The entrance area was filled with numerous tanks containing various sized lobsters, oversized Alaskan king crabs and snow crabs.  My immediate thought was fresh seafood and the name of the restaurant was very fitting.   Walking into the dining area I was immediately impressed by the elegant decor and spacious open room consisting of high ceilings with elaborate chandeliers, red linen table cloths and seat covers. Not many Chinese restaurants consist of this style, so it's one of the few luxurious ones I've seen.  We had reservation and had a set dinner menu which consisted of numerous dishes associated with Chinese new year.  I cannot comment on the pricing as my uncle handled the selection and we didn't have menus to use as reference.   Since it was Chinese new year it was extremely busy and the service was very slow, but the servers were quite attentive when they were at our tables. The first dish didn't arrive until over an hour after we sat down, but the fact we were able to bring our own bottles of wine made up for the wait time.  We had two tables reserved and were seated at the very back corner by the emergency exit which was quite drafty.  Throughout the night staff members came and went through the emergency exit which was a little inconvenient as there was not much room between the two tables.    Overall, it was a great restaurant with nice presentation of dishes and food was tasty with right amounts of flavouring, plus the ambience was really enjoyable.  Definitely a great place for fine dining and worth the drive to Mississauga for the seafood and decor."}
{"text":"I just moved to Etobicoke a few months ago and have been searching for a dim sum spot reasonably close by.  Blue Lagoon popped up on my search so I took the family on a Saturday morning. We were all very excited.   We ordered 14 dishes and they were all beyond bad. The Sui mai was overpowered by ginger, the beef tripe tasted like it was boiled in water, even the tea was really bad.  The tea was as if they reboiled old tea and reused the leaves.   I've been eating dim sum my entire life and this was easily the worst I've ever had. I will never go back, even if it was free."}
{"text":"Chaotic but good, blue lagoon takes dim sum to the next level. Apparently they're good for dinner too. Somehow survived family day here today, and even though we had a reservation, we had to wait about 15 minutes. This place can seat hundreds but there is always a line. Several tanks of live seafood near the entrance provide a good distraction for the kids. Bathrooms are reasonably clean for a Chinese restaurant.  Quality of food is very good and prices are a little more than what you would usually pay for dim sum, but I would avoid this place on a holiday or weekend if possible."}
{"text":"We went in for a set seafood dinner on a Tuesday evening. Although there were only a handful of tables with guests, the kitchen was slow and the service disorganized. The unsatisfactory service cannot be due to inadequate staffing, because there were certainly more of them than customers - staff in black suits who checks to see if your order has arrived, staff in black vests to take orders or whatnot, staff in more traditional Chinese costume to bring the food out of the kitchen, etc...It's rare to experience an overstaffed Chinese restaurant. The lobster and fish ordered were fresh, but execution could be better. The batter on the lobster and oysters were too heavy and chewy. The sauce for the steamed fish way too heavy on salt and soy. For $70+ per head, we expected much better."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this overpriced establishment and expected the quality of food to be a notch above other Chinese restaurants....but it wasn't and the service we received was poor. The only upside to this place it has classy decor and gives you a vibe of being in a semi fine restaurant in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Blue Lagoon has become my go to place for dim sum. Unlike a lot of large dim sum restaurants, the dim sum does not come around on a steam cart. You order what you want, they cook it and bring it out for you fresh. From 9 AM to 11 AM (not sure if this is true on weekends) the dim sum is at a discount price, but come before 11 as I have seen lineups by 10;45. I am usually one of the few non-Chinese customers there and I believe that Blue Lagoon's popularity with Chinese customers is a plus.   I have not tried it for dinner; however, the fish tanks in the entry contain an impressive array of huge Alaska King Crabs, 5 pound lobsters and live fish. Obviously, the seafood served for dinner is quite fresh."}
{"text":"I'm a Scarborough boy from way back and I know my Scarborough dim sum places back in the 90's and early 2000's. The novelty has worn off and most restaurants for both cost effectiveness and time no longer do push carts.   But then increase quality with that efficiency! Very few places have done this and the places that do, are very expensive.   Blue Lagoon has great dim sum for a moderate price and has all the favorites.   Fantastic dim sum. Above average. I haven't had time to come for their amazing looking lobster and king crab dinners but if the dim sum is any indication, it's going to be great."}
{"text":"One word, DELICIOUS!  Came here for the first time for a birthday dinner, the staff were extremely nice and gave us their recommendations. We ended up ordering the Peking duck which was amazing!    Although my only complaint would be that it seems like they cut the cucumbers ahead of time so they were slightly dried out. We also got fried oysters which are without a doubt the best bite of seafood I've ever had.   Overall this is my absolute favourite restaurant and I can't wait to return. SO GOOD"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, really.  One of few higher end dim sum places in Mississauga and the only one (to my knowledge) on the eastern end of the city. The decor is relatively nice, compared to the \"typical\" Chinese banquet restaurant, with a more muted colour palette, modern chandeliers, damask tablecloths, and brocade chair covers. The tableware is also a step up from the typical Chinese restaurant with more visually interesting dinnerware and serving dishes and silver-accented chopsticks.  Service is average, polite but not particularly proactive. On our most recent visit, they had these \"call bell\" type contraptions on each table that would (supposedly) signal to someone that some sort of assistance was needed. We didn't really need to use it though, as the only thing we needed was a tea refill, for which we used the \"traditional\" signal (i.e., lid displaced).  The food was, for the most part, pretty good. With few exceptions, everything was served hot. The fried items were crispy and not too greasy. The dumpling skins were relatively thin. The seafood was tasty and fresh tasting. The only item that I didn't like on our most recent visit was the mango salad rolls... I kind of figured it would be weird, but we were like, \"hey, let's try something new.\"  Tip: If you order before 11 AM on a weekday, smalls, mediums, and larges are all $2.60 (compared to $2.60, $3.60, and $4.60, respectively).  So to sum up... Good quality dim sum for a reasonable price (if you go during the right time) in my neighbourhood. Sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Dim Sum places around the city and today was my first visit to Blue Lagoon.  It has moved to the top of my favorite dim sum places because the food is fresh and tasty the selection is wide and organized and easy to choose from and the staff are friendly, helpful and always smiling.  The lovely decor adds to the pleasant atmosphere.   I returned to this place because I had such a good experience the first time.  My second experience was not good and I have downgraded my previous rating of 5 stars to 1.  They have removed the wifi buttons from the tables. The waiter informed me that if you order before 11:00 am you have to pay cash despite the fact that we dined from about 10:45 to about 12:30 and ordered a lot of dim sum.  The waiter was abrupt when informing us of this policy so I had to go to a nearby bank to withdraw cash to pay them.  Needless to say I didn't tip because this is very poor customer service. The first time I was here I paid with my debit card no problem. Unless they fix this policy I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This is not a chinatown kinda dim sum place first off. Their price, ambiance set up supposed to be in a good ranking category. Our experience however was far more undermined. Service was ignored, food was cold. We asked for vinegar for our table of 6. A monkey dish of it was served. Employees seem to be underpaid, or with no service expectations in mind. Retrain, regain to be more inviting urgently if I were the owner in order to remain in competition. To add more icing to the bad service, a man in suit came to our table and clearly announced (service charge is not included) How unprofessional and offended was that.  We would not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Very poor service and extremely long waiting time for the food as compare to a typical dim sum place. Dim sums tastes average but after you finish your meal you will feel very thirsty, I think they have put too much msg or seasoning to the dishes. Don't like the place but price wise, they provide a dim sum special from Monday to Friday before 11am --all s m l dim sum counts as s's prices. And I think that's why there were still many ppl going on a weekday."}
{"text":"There's a big markup on the pricing, what you end up paying up is the presentation and the food just tastes mediocre"}
{"text":"Overall, I would rate this restaurant the same, although there have been some good and bad changes since my last review.   PROS: - Now $2.89 for all small, medium, and large dim sum every day of the week (excluding holidays) until 12 PM if paying cash only, so I'm glad they have increased the times to make it more attractive to dine here - Still have the lobster lunch specials which are good for larger groups - Clean bathrooms  CONS: - Quality has gone down-hill for some of the dim sum dishes (maybe as a result of the reduction in price?) - Portion sizes for some dishes seem noticeably smaller (e.g. a large portion of congee was $10 which could probably only feed 2 people) - Wait times can be a bit long as it gets busy during peak periods (e.g. before 12 noon due to the discount, and weekends) - Wi-Fi used to be open to everyone and accessible, but now it's not... not sure why that is  Take Home Point: No longer my 'go-to' dim sum place, but I would come here for affordable dim sum before 12 noon or when impressing the family with a fancy lobster meal."}
{"text":"Easily the best place for dim sum in Mississauga. With a great location, helpful staff and quality food to offer.    I remember this restaurant from my childhood as its situated in the heart of Mississauga Chinatown, and since then it's changed several times. But I think finally someone got it right!   The ambience in the restaurant is great, clean modern lines for decoration and high ceilings that make the space look open and welcoming.   The service for \"Chinese\" standards is pretty good. They are attentive and usually get everything that you ask for, whether it be condiments or extra water etc.   The food, my favourite part of this place! The food is absolutely great! Not only is it well presented but it's a good portion and tastes really good! For dim sum they have a lot of different variety that includes the classic items"}
{"text":"Our table was for 2 people.  Sorry forgot the photos. We ordered the deep fried lobster (2)lb, choy sum in garlic, yang chow rice, and a small seafood hot and sour to share. Loved the soup.  I have had better yang chow rice but was not special, the choy sum was as expected. The hero dish we wanted was left a bit wanting.  Unfortunatly the lobster was over cooked and very rubbery.   I think that based on other reviews we will come back for dim sum and try them again."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with 6 other people on a Saturday night (7pm). We made reservations in advance but it wasn't that busy when we arrived.   The appearance and look of the restaurant is beautiful! It has tall ceilings, bright colours, has a large tv and very spacious.  We ordered one of the fixed meals for 6 people which was A LOT of food! A little pricey (about $300) but it fed 7 people and we had leftovers  Our meal came with: - blue lagoon soup  - clams with white wine sauce - HK style lobster - Vancouver crab  - fried rice - Chinese brocoli - eel with veggies  Lobster was amazing!!! Sooooo good!! Great flavours and you can tell how fresh they are!  I'll definitely be back. Would like to try their dimsum next time!"}
{"text":"I think people come here for the atmosphere; the food was only ok. As far as dim sum places go, it has nice high ceilings and a nice aquarium inspired entrance. The bathrooms are typical East Asian restaurant quality, so don't use them if you don't have to. Service was fast but not attentive and it took us repeated attempts to get a vegetable dish order acknowledged. The food was kind of bland compared to other dim sum places in Mississauga, but they tried to make up for it with portion sizes which were a little bigger than average.  Overall, not a favourable experience and I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good, and isn't too pricey either. It tastes more like an average dim sum place, but the area is nice. Great architecture and is located in a beautiful Chinese themed plaza."}
{"text":"In all the times I have dined here, never have I been so irate.   For all the dim sum go-ers, if you've visited Blue Lagoon, then you're well versed on how extremely slow this place is. Dim sum for two people can easily stretch out into 2 hours, simply because you're waiting 40 minutes for one dish, or all the forgotten items. Not to mention, the 15 minutes wait to pay after you've asked for the bill.  Whether it's a table of two, or a family of 7, service has always been terrible.  I will admit, quality of food is fair, and one of the better places in Mississauga. However, unless you're able to order Happy Hour before 11am, prices are hella steep compared to the rest of the suburban dim sum joints.   $2.60 for small, medium, large - happy hour $2.60 (s), $3.60 (m), $4.60 (l), $5.5 (xl), $6.50 (sp), $7.50 (j)  Our visit this time around, was instantly dampened by their own manager. A waitress tending to the table next to us, asked in Chinese what tea we would like - before we could even respond, the manager setting our table muttered racist remarks, advised her to give us whatever, we're not even Asian.   ...sorry, what?  Ironically, we are very much \"asian\", and had been speaking Chinese to the rest of the staff from when we walked in.   As someone who has been recommending this place to patrons of all races, this makes me weary of how they were/will be treated.   After looking past the extreme waits, order issues in the past, this was the icing on the cake. I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing clients or non-chinese friends here! It's sad. The wait staff are pleasant, but management needs to seriously clean up their act."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe one dozen times, only for morning special dim sum time. Food is okay here; most things are at least passable, with a couple dishes that make this place stand out from other dim sum restaurants.  I always get the scallop shrimp dumplings, pork buns, and the preserved duck egg + meat congee. I really like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and the scallop shrimp dumplings are almost the same, except with a tiny bit of scallop on top. The dumplings are big, the outer shell/wrap is not too thick, and its fresh. The pork buns I love because of the bread texture; usually pork buns are made into big white dense buns, but these have a lighter, crisper kind of pastry-type exterior, similar maybe to the pineapple bun. Lastly, the congee is different every time I go; its either really flavourful and fantastic, or the flavour is way too light and it tastes like bland white congee with nothing in it. What batch you get depends on luck.  The more disappointing dishes I have tried here include the spring rolls (bland, nothing much inside, more pastry than filling) and the rice noodle rolls (rough and over cooked). Other dishes like siu mai, the mango milk pastry, and fried shrimp dumplings were passable, but nothing special. But $2.89 for tiny one-person portions aren't exactly cheap, so I usually opt out of these.  Decor is great. Most dim sum places I've been too are quite worn down and dingy. This place is decorated nicely and would be great for meeting friends or celebrating occasions. At the very least, taking photos here would be nice.  I also like how after you hand in your order form marked with how many you want of what, they give you a printed out receipt of the items. It makes it easy to check what you ordered and whats still missing. At other places, I usually have to count how many items I ordered before handing the order form in and have no idea what specific dish I am still missing."}
{"text":"The abience is very good with the updated modern design and high sealing. I like how the space was minimized from the previous restaurant that was at that location. However the service, quantity and quality of the food has dropped off sharpely since I cpnsistantly visited as a kid. No doubt the presentation has vastly been upgraded. However we ordered dinner  off the menu (instead of the banquet menu) so that my friends were able to see and read what it is we wanted to order. I actually had to walk to the front to retrieve a menu after being seated for ten minutes. Our server was no where in site most of our visit even though only half the place had customers. I tried asking other waitresses and waiters if I could order drinks because there was a number of staff on hand. The other waitresses and waiters told me if we wanted something we had to wait for our own waiter.  This was annoying. We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet and sour pork with pineapple, seafood medley in a basket, and western style beef tenderloin. I admit that it did take us a little long to order because there was a language berrier between my friend Colombian wife and the waitress. I commend the waitress for being patient. However I tried to have my friends and girl friend to order food that they would like as opposed to what I would normally order for my family and I. This is so they wouldn't  constantly keep asking what it is or what in it. The food taste wise was comparable to any place you go that serves Chinese food in the GTA and Hamilton area. The table behind us ordered the same sweet and sour pork and got a very large quantity while we go a very small quantity. Being Chinese myself and pushing to go out for them to try food from my heritage. I was a little embarrassed we kind of got shafted and hoped my girlfriend and friends who were visiting from South America didn't notice the quantity  discrepancy between the two tables. The bill came and it was around $100 which was OK since I understand Blue Lagoon is more of a luxury restaurant now. We gave the waitress a +$20 tip out of courtesy. However I won't be making the trip anytime soon to revisit or suggest this place when my relative fly in from China or Hong Kong."}
{"text":"**UPDATED FEB 2015 FROM 2.5 STARS: My family has been back several times since the opening and it seems they've worked out the kinks. Also, the adjacent BBQ meat store sells some tasty meat!**  The appearance of this place is kinda weird. The logo outside the building makes it look like a casually hip restaurant but inside it's very new money with a touch of gaudy.   The food is a bit meh given the hype around this place. I find it's quite average and nothing special. Also, everything is a bit on the salty side.   Since this place is so new they're working out lots of kinks. They have at least four different menus on the table, some of which list the same items but at different prices (we had to dispute one of the items on our bill).  P.S. The Chinese-style pizza bun is nothing like pizza. It's more like a cha siu bao with a bolo bao topping."}
{"text":"Terrible service. This is an experience I must share.  We were seated quite quickly given that it was on a long weekend. I wanted to try the monster or pig egg yolk steamed buns. When I asked the staff if they had the buns, she said yes. After being seated, we were left to order on the menu sheets. We also asked for Tie Guan Yin (a kind of tea). We waited for a long time for someone to come by and collect our sheet, but nobody came, so we had to hand it into the person inputting the orders on the computer.   The buns were not on the menu, so after we handed the sheet in, we put in an order for the pig buns because when I asked the waitress, she said they were sold out of the monster ones, but still had the pig ones. She even went to go check and came back to tell me that. We were given a receipt of all the food items we ordered on a receipt that was typed up. The pig buns were a separate receipt that was taped to our menu sheet.   Many of our dishes came in a timely fashion. We ordered about 6 dishes and finished them all. Also, to add in, they never cleared the finished dishes. The empty plates and steamers kept piling up on our table. It was also odd that our pig buns still hadn't arrived. It was 50 minutes since we ordered them. We went to ask the person outside (since not a single staff member was around to serve our table). Suddenly another staff member comes and just puts the bill on our table even though we A) didn't ask for the bill B) just asked about our missing pig bun. He answered us by swishing his arm to us and left. A female staff member came to our table telling us that they had sold out of the egg yolk buns. She even accused us of having it on our menu sheet when it was their staff that input the order onto the computer to print the receipt out. They didn't even apologize for their lack of knowledge and miscommunication between their staff. All she asked us was who was the waitress that told us that they still had pig buns.   This was the worst service I have ever had. Although the food was mediocre and acceptable, their service was horrendous. The tea that we ordered also wasn't the best, it left a bitter aftertaste on your tongue."}
{"text":"Rubbery overcooked lobster, bland yang chow fried rice, delicious soup, nearly raw choy sum - impossible to chew.  Definitely NOT worth the $114. for 2!!!!  You pay for the fancy décor and service - NOT the food quality.  Oh yeah - and they forgot my chardonnay - had to ask for it partly during the meal."}
{"text":"Me and my siblings came today at this restaurant, it was a busy valentine/family Sunday w/c we understand. We order almost $300 worth of lunch but we got a diff order. We are so disappointed that we did not get what we expecting to eat.  A very disappointing day to celebrate. Hoping to get a better service for the rest of the customers."}
{"text":"Here's what you should know. We ordered the Lobster Seafood Set for 6 people that cost $258.00.  The Bad:  - The soup was watery, no flavour like it wasn't cooked long enough - The crab had no flavour and it was over-cooked. It smelled like it was fried in old oil - Parts of the lobster were under cooked - Veggie was soggy and over-cooked - Clams were flavourless as they were just boiled - Stir-fried eel was just not good - Service was unhelpful and slow, soup came halfway through the meal  The Good: - Fried rice was good and flavourful - The tea was hot - We ordered beer and glassware was clean"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, so when my in-laws mentioned a newly renevoated dim sum joint in Sauga, I was all for it (not sure about you guys, but I've been noticing that dim sum restos are hard to come by in this neck of the woods!).  Located in old school chitown, Blue Lagoon features a large variety of dim sum (paper ordering, with English!), and a discount if you order before 11am (2.60 for all SML dishes Monday to Friday, 2.80 on Saturday and Sunday). Keep an eye on the weekends, since small dishes are normally 2.60, so you're technically overpaying on the weekends if you just order small plates.   The service is good, we arrived around 940am and were seated right away. The six of us ordered a large variety of food (ranked awesome to meh): - spring rolls wrapped in rice rolls - egg tarts - bbq pork bun with \"pineapple\" topping - crispy onion pancake - xo shrimp and chive dumpling - ha gow - siu mai - beef tripe - lotus wrapped chicken and sticky rice - corn congee - beef tendon - steamed veggie dumpling - mango pancake (deep fried)  A lot of food for a decent price - I'm down for another round here!"}
{"text":"A very average experience. I actually went for dinner then Dim sum the next day and I both meals were mediocre. For dinner I went with a party of 4 and we ordered 4 dish combo of 5lb lobster, scallops, veggies, and chicken. The appetizer arrived quick and was tasty like any MSG soup, except with a little oyster on the bottom. The first dish was the lobster which was presented nicely but that's about it. There wasn't really anything special aside from the presentation. Little mountains of batter/flour/garlic didn't really appeal to me. The lobster was like something I could get anywhere. I likened the other dishes like a \"pick three for this price\" variety found in many Chinese restaurants. For the service, it seemed fine until it felt like in the end they completely forgot us and took a while to hand our bill, then card machine. Total price: about $35 per person. Never again.  Dim sum was $2.70 for any size before 11am. A pretty good deal assuming the food is up to scratch. I pretty much ordered the basics: shrimp dumplings, rice noodles, etc. The food was alright; great quality and care, fresh flavour. My only issue was the service; a repeat of the previous night. In this case however the restaurant was rather busy as opposed to the night before (the room was only half full). Despite all this, I still wouldn't come back unless they can wow me with something besides presentation."}
{"text":"Came here for a family get together, and was not really impressed. First off, we had about 20 people and made a reservation. We had a family member come here in person to check the menu and make the reservation, but somehow, there was no record of it when we showed up! They ended up just clearing 2 smaller tables for us, but it wasn't all that comfortable, and the food barely fit on the table.   We ordered one of the set meals, and added Peking Duck. The duck was quite good, but most pieces were just skin with no meat on it whatsoever. We got some seafood dishes as well, which all seemed to be high in MSG, and the meat dishes all seemed over seasoned. Not the greatest Chinese food for the price we ended up paying!   Service was decent, but not up to par for a seafood restaurant. We had crab and lobster and other seafood, which creates a lot of garbage on the plates. They did not come to give us new plates until our meal was completely over, and didn't make an effort to accommodate our large numbers at the small tables. We ended up having to clear plates and stack them ourselves to even make enough room.   Not a place I'd go again, especially with it being further away from home."}
{"text":"The best seafood restaurant. Their Hong Kong style lobster is so delicious you will want a 3lb lobster all for yourself. All dishes are plated beautifully for an enjoyable and upscale dining experience. As expected, It's more expensive than the average Chinese restaurant and is well worth the price.  They also serve dim sum which is cheaper during happy hour. Simply order before 12 noon and pay cash for the dim sum."}
{"text":"Sunday dim sum, 2 adults, 2 kids, worked out to $48 before tax & gratuities. Don't be surprised to be charged for the tea.  Food was very good. The steamed rice rolls (cheong fan) were excellent. The lobster chow mein special was good (note: did not come with claws).  Service was OK. We were seated quickly. There are no carts. You order and dishes are brought to your table.  The lobster claws on the washroom signs were cute but the men's washroom facilities themselves were a disappointment. First sink had no running water, second sink had lukewarm water, and third sink had really hot water. No soap in the dispensers. No paper in the towel dispenser. Hand dryer not working."}
{"text":"I came here with my family after a day long trip from the States. We received prompt and decent service. The restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good too with huge portions. I have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my family on a sunday. By 9:30am, most tables were already taken. Apparently it's cheaper to come and eat before 11am. Food was great - the egg custard tarts were the best! 9 people and the bill only came up to $110 - which was a steaaaal. Everyone left happy and full - as well as very tired. Dim sum is a coma inducer.   Will be back! My only complaint is that the carpet is pretttyyyy gross."}
{"text":"My very first time here with my family.  We ordered the family dinner set for $238.00 and if you pay cash you can add one of the three choices for $1 to $3 extra depends 9n what you want.  We picked the Pecking duck for $3 extra.  The waitress then told us due to the increasing price of lobsters they need to charge us $3 extra per pound of lobster.  I asked if it was announCe anywhere in writing?  She told us that \"I am telling you now\".  She also mentioned that we can't change the menu or substitute anything but pay for he $12 extra.  On top of that, we will need to pay cash.    First of all, this is false advisement.  2nd, it puts us in a very awkward situation and have no choice.  Luckily we can afford the extra $12.  The service was pretty bad too.  The wifi was not working, the tea was not provided until we asked.  We asked for hot peppers and the waitress told us we need to ask the manager for permission.  Asked for manager and he literally told us there will be a charge.  That's fine.  Give us the hot peppers!!  Will never come back again!!!    However, we give the credit to one of the waitress-Lucy, who constantly provided good services to us, adding tea/hot water, changing plates and made sure we are okay.  Other than that, I do not see any reasons to come back here."}
{"text":"Dim sum is just ok. I would go back to try the lobster and Peking duck tho. The dim sum quality is not the highest and they don't have some traditional things like taro dumpling. It's a big space so you don't have to wait for tables.  They only take cash for special price dim sum."}
{"text":"Huge Chinese restaurant with great dim sum. Same location has changed ownership and names over the years. Chinese favorite number 8 is repeated thrice for the address-888 Dundas Rd. At 11:45 on a weekday, there must have been a minimum of 100 diners. Envoirnment is of a large wedding/ banquet hall. However the service is pretty good and the food comes out of the kitchen pretty fast.  2-3 Dim sum choices and any lunch special rice/noodle dish can be too much for a couple. It is a nice place to sit around with lots of friends and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Have been here for dim sum and it was good.  So we thought we would try dinner for a change.  Ordered the dinner for 2 which came with wonton soup, crab claws, lobster, lemon chicken, veggie noodle dish and dessert.    The wonton soup was tasty with plump round shrimp and pork dumplings floating in a  clear broth with tiny bits of roast pork and fine slices of green onion.    The crab claws were crispy and typical Chinese style crab claws often served at weddings.    Lemon chicken was a nice sweet yet tart lemony sauce on lightly battered and fried breast meat.  Vegetable noodles was a fancy presentation of crispy noodles with an assortment of vegetables in a gloopy sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  This was my least favourite dish.  The lobster was nicely steamed with garlic and green onion oil on top.  It came in two separate plates so we could each fight with it to our hearts content.  Dessert soup was a white fungus, red date, almonds, and lychee in a sweet broth.  It tastes vaguely Chinese herbal flavour so I assume it's good for you too....  We enjoyed ourselves and the service was attentive.  Absolutely no complaints and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far top notch quality dim sum. Everything was fresh and melt in your mouth goodness! The ambience is beautiful and highly decorated.  Chandaliers, projector screens, and tons of Lobsters, Crabs, Eels, and Tilapia surround you.  The service in this place is AMAZING.  Yes...even for a busy Chinese dim sum restaurant all of the staff were polite, courteous, and they even smiled. All of our requests for more water, hot sauce, and napkins came so quickly along with our food.  The utensils, plates, and even table cloths were all high end.  Needless to say you can tell right away that this place means business.  I went here at prime time lunch hour and the staff works like one smooth flowing unit.  Everything about their food, service, and decor is exceptional!  We ordered the usual dim sum staple dishes such as hai gow, siu mai, tripe, duck feet, shrimp crepes, deep fried shrimp wonton, and also got buck wild and added some hot and sour soup, snow peas, gai lun, veal ribs, and a lot of other things I am probably missing but every dish was FRESH and just so friggin good!  Next time I will be back for Lobster and King Crab because they look so so so scrumptious!"}
{"text":"If you are an early bird, go blue lagoon for dimsum. They have all small medium and large dimsum for $3 each if you place your order before 12noon. I went with family around 10:30, no line up. Love their  house special dimsum. There were 5 of us, the bill comes in at $50. Not bad! I will come back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Overall: 3/5  Although I was not wowed by the food, I enjoyed some dishes well enough to come back. I also came here for dim sum on another occasion and overall, the food does hold up. This is a good place to get your fix for Chinese comfort food in Mississauga!   Taste: 3/5 Decent place for Chinese food but nothing spectacular. We ordered a 2.5 lb lobster (good portion for 3 people), black bean clams, snow peas, and an order of Yang Zhou fried rice. The fried rice and snow peas were a slightly bland - likely good for a more elderly crowd if you want the food to be less flavourful. The server actually wrote down the wrong type of lobster dish that we wanted...but I still really enjoyed what we were served. Would come back for this dish! The clams were a miss - the black bean sauce didn't pair well with the clams and there were quite a few empty shells; a little disappointed with this one. Bonus: I was delighted when they served free red bean paste dessert. Not a lot of places serve this for free now so it was a welcome surprise (note: I didn't enjoy the red bean paste dessert from here as much but having it for free certainly made up for it!)  Service: 2/5 Servers were slow to take orders and were not proactive in refilling empty tea pots or changing plates. The server also took down the wrong order for our lobster. This error turned out well though because we did like our final dish however, I would not be impressed otherwise.   Ambience: 4/5 The restaurant was spacious, and well lit. From the set-up it looks like the restaurant is well-equipped to hold large functions/parties/weddings. There was a large projector screen TV playing Chinese shows and 4 smaller projector screens across the restaurant (smaller screens were not in use). Bonus: washrooms were clean and ample free parking outside!"}
{"text":"The place itself looked super fancy. The restaurant was huge, super spacious, lots of seating and high ceilings with chandeliers.   The presentation of each dish looked outstanding! Really great plating however, the taste itself was mediocre. Did not enjoy the food at all and the service was horrible.   Would I come back? Probably, not."}
{"text":"It's really gone down, I used to come here when I was a kid and the food was always fantastic.   Today it's really changed.   Food: Bland, Watery, Tasteless. Everything is so clearly mass produced to fill the demand that they've skipped over crucial components of dimsum. I had the curry octopus, curry was watery, bland not even spicy or a hint of fragrance.   Service: UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. like I'm talking we sat there for an hour for dimsum, that only slowly trickled in. The servers were dazed and overworked. A server even came up to our table asked if we ordered soy sauce, we replied yes and they put down hot sauce in front of us taking away our soy sauce which was clearly on his platter??   We got hungry as we waited for our next plate of dimsum which had 4 and we had like 5 people so one of us never got to eat lol for another 15 minutes  Decor: Average nothing's changed just the quality and speed has changed.   SUM IT UP: not going back, I'd rather go somewhere else. Foods meh, food comes out slow, and servers are too tired."}
{"text":"First the Dim SUM:  Mississauga is sorely lacking good dim sum places. Or maybe my standards have been pushed up because of all the awesome places I have been to. All the best places seem to be on the east side of GTA like Markham or Scarborough. I would have to say this is the best you can get in Mississauga. They have an early bird special which can save you lots of money when S/M/L are the price of S. At this price range I would say it's good value. The regular prices are quite steep for their quality.  We have tried a variety of dishes. Their specialty BBQ bun I did not find special at all. Everything was just \"good\". Nothing was bad. It was so standard that I struggle to find additional words to write about their dim sum dishes. Their selection is decent but not the most extensive out there. Their dumplings are huge but only come in 3's.   Now for dinner: The fish tanks outside tell you that the seafood is going to be fresh. But my family opted for mostly non0seafood instead for some reason. I guess they didn't want to spend money. We had a peking duck and some standard dishes. And also a fish. Nothing really wowed us. It was just ok...  Overall this is still a solid place for Chinese food, especially by Mississauga standards."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this place with our family. It tastes very good and fresh. Love the lobsters! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other evening. One of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. Came here starving and ordered snow peas, seafood fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.   The first two dishes took around 15-20 minutes to come out, whereas the sweet and sour pork came 20-25 minutes after the first two, after we had already finishing our snow peas and fried rice. We also asked for a menu twice after ordering, to add more dishes. No waiter/waitress came back with a menu. Very terrible service.  I found the food to be quite overpriced. Ordered a \"seafood\" fried rice which cost around $16-$17. Came back with a small portion on a plate with the seafood almost non-existent. The food was very disappointing.  Will not be returning to this restaurant and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in the city in my opinion but it is pricey and the line ups are terrible. As is consistent with most Chinese restaurants, service could be improved."}
{"text":"Best DIM SUM in Mississauga! This place has renovated so many times from different restaurant names/owners since I used to go there as a kid but I can finally say that Blue Lagoon Seafood Master has hit the spot. Went here for dim sum and dinner on two separate occasions and both meals have been delectable. From great service to delicious tasting and fresh food! I was thorougly impressed with the service because you usually don't expect great service at an asian restaurant. One example, is that we accidently spilled tea on the table and the server immediately came by and cleaned up the mess with a smile. The decor of the restaurant was absolutely stunning and definitely looked like a high class fancy chinese restaurant with beaming chandeliers. The front of the restaurant is encased with fish and lobster tanks so you can tell that they specialize in seafood. Overall, this restaurant deserves 5 stars hands down! Just a tip, thry have special price dim sum for $2.70 all sizes before 11:00AM. So go here if you are ever craving some great dim sum in the area."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm still eating dinner lol. This is my first time here for dinner and compared to the service during dim sum hours, it's quite fast! I'm impressed. We didn't have to wait quite long before our dishes arrived. Everything was delicious, the steamed fish was very smooth and melts in your mouth, the Beijing duck was good but I've had better. Our server was quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The best thing about it is the early morning deal: S/M/L dishes for $2.99 before 12PM on weekdays and $3.09 on weekends.  I came here twice and had two very different experiences so your experience will depend on your waiter.  The first time I came, the service is terrible af. Our waitress would made eye contact with us and walked away while we were asking a question. She took our water pitcher to fill up and never brought it back. She gave us one tiny thing of hot sauce for four people and asked us \"why\" when we asked for more. She even brought us an extra dish that we didn't order and tried to make us keep it. Needless to say, I vowed never to come back but my friends brought me here again.  The second time I came, our waitress was really nice and pleasant. There were no problems with her or the food.  The food is ok compared to other dim sum restaurants but it's worth the early bird price and fulfills the craving. We ordered so much food but I feel like there's nothing to rave about.  If you come here, DO NOT ORDER the Deep Fried Stuffed Crab Claw!! Each order comes with ONE small one and costs $5.99. It's the biggest rip off."}
{"text":"I ventured to this restaurant based on pictures on Yelp.  This place is more than just good food.  It's situated in this large plaza constructed with Chinese design that includes a large Chinese structured entrance and other similar style buildings around the plaza.  A small taste of being in China.    The restaurant is in the back.  Today was a 20 minute wait while me and my kids viewed the 15 or so large tanks which held huge lobsters, lively  Alaskan king crab, eel and geoduck.    My son loves the table side Peking duck so we went for that, but I'll surely be back with a group for the seafood.  In addition to the duck, we had the fried veal ribs which were some of the best Asian style ribs I've had.  Finally we were surprised by the sudden entrance of a dancing dragon crew.  Three of these costumes dancing dragons flew through the dining area, interacting with the patrons, as drums were played by the entrance.  A more than expected experience."}
{"text":"The service and hygiene here are so bad that you can't help but laugh it off or risk loosing your mind or be defeated by those hungry pangs. Food is mediocre with some showcase items and some not worth trying. Pretty standard for dim sum places I supposed."}
{"text":"Of all the dim sum places that I have gone to (I'm from the states), I would have to say this place is just OK. If anything it was mediocre. The service was terrible especially going in a big party of 19. We would constantly have to flag them down because we didn't have napkins, not enough dining ware, and we had to ask for sauces. Normally everything is already set on the table before I order or after but I'm assuming it was so busy that they forget everything. Eliminating pushing the carts and ordering as you go instead doesn't work well with big parties. The food does come out warm but takes way too long.  I wouldn't come back with my family, we would probably try to find another place the next time we come to Canada."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum for light lunch. The food was good.  Doesn't seem to be too busy. Very spacious restaurant."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that you can come here on a Saturday afternoon and not have to wait an hour to be seated like many places in Richmond Hill or Markham.   The food is ordered off the menu, but they also have servers that come around with items occasionally. Everything that came to the table was lukewarm edging the point where it was almost cold. However, the taste of everything was good. The vegetable dumpling was piping hot though!   The restaurant is huge and the quality of the dim sum isn't bad. I definitely prefer it to Emerald and would come back again if I was desperate for some dim sum.   Note: don't expect service to be phenomenal, it took a long time for some dishes to come out."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum places in Mississauga. It is imperative that you must attend this restaurant before 11am so you can get those nice 50% off discounts. That means more food for less price! Extremely big and spacious, quite loud but hey that's what a Chinese restaurant is. I would definitely recommend the BBQ pork buns they are famous for that! Delicious and always very fresh."}
{"text":"Upsetting. Not only did we wait an hour for only three of our 9 dishes to arrive, the surrounding tables (that arrived after us) received their orders and had their tables filled with food as we waited another 30 minutes for our next dish.   2 hours in and 2 requests to get our food in a timely manner after, we were finally fed up. We asked the manager for the bill and to cancel the other 6 dishes, but instead of coming back with the bill, she came to tell us that our dishes were already being made. So we gave them a second chance but after ANOTHER half an hour we asked for the bill.   The other manager who cashed us out at the front didn't even make eye contact or say a word as we paid for our horrible food and service (a $270 bill). No apologies were made, but that's standard for Asian restaurant service.  Simply disgusting."}
{"text":"Went here for Chinese New Year and got seated really quickly. From there everything went downhill, first off there was no peking duck available on Chinese New Year!!!!!??? My family ended up ordering 5 dishes and it took over 30 minutes for our first dish to come. All the dishes came cold and was super salty.   Service was something else, it was horrible. I asked for a refill on our pitcher of water and the waiter snatched it out of my hand.   We ended up cancelling one of the dishes after an hour of waiting and the workers still tried to get us to wait for it but we were fed up and just wanted to leave.   Won't be returning back here."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that whenever you do business with any place please remember to get some paperwork and have them explain to you all of their policies in detail with a written and signed copy of it as well.   My mother booked an event with this place and gave them a $500 deposit. When this agreement was made they did not explain to her the policies concerning refund or give any written statement solidifying this contract - not even an invoice for this transaction! For personal reasons we decided to cancel this booking and ask for the deposit back 4 months before the event would even take place and less than 30 days after they took the deposit.   Attempt 1: When my mom called this place back they informed her that they could not return the deposit because it is non-refundable since they already used it to purchase items for the event. This was incredulous to me since there is nothing that a restaurant purchases for an event that will happen 4 months later for a small party. When my mother asked for even a portion of it back or as a service credit they denied it and ended the call.   Attempt 2: I myself went to his location with a friend who spoke Cantonese to give them another chance before we took legal action. I wrote them a letter which I delivered to them in person and asked again if I could get the money back. The manager on duty said that my mother agreed that the deposit was non-refundable the first time she  called because she told them \"okay\" after they denied her requests. This did not mean that she agreed but simply meant she heard what they said after they denied her. The manager was extremely unprofessional as he tried to intimidate my friend and I by implying that we were outnumbered that day. He then made up a story about how he remembered explaining everything to my mother and she understand (which she didn't). When I asked for a written confirmation to show that she understood the terms he did not respond but kept insisting that she agreed to it after they already took the deposit. There's more to this time but we ended walking out without the money and the business was served with the letter giving them a deadline to respond.  Attempt 3: They called my mother and said that it was possible to return the money and all she had to do was come to the place of business. I went at the end of that week to collect the money on her behalf and they asked for an invoice. I then reminded them that they did not give us one. They insisted they did and that it was \"impossible\" they didn't give her one. They had a copy of that invoice but that was not sufficient for them as they absolutely needed our non-existent copy for whatever reason. They then said that my mom needed to come in the day after with her ID and whatever papers they gave her (literally a copy of the menu and 2 business cards) since they \"did not know who [I] was\". They told her also to bring a witness so that when she collected she would sign a paper acknowledging that it had been done and that she was the person whose name is on their invoice. I said alright and then left.   Attempt 4: My mother returned to the restaurant with her friend and my brother the final time. Once again they brought up the issue of the invoice to which my brother (who came with me on attempt 3) said they just needed her ID since that is what they told me the previous day. They ignored them and just kept saying no. My brother then asked them one final time to which they responded \"no\" with without any substantive reasons.   These events took place between March 3rd, 2018 to March 11th, 2018. During that time they made us run back and forth a total of 3 times saying different things every time. I am extremely upset that they handled this affair the way that they did and have documented every occurrence that took place. What's especially upsetting is that they would play these games with my mother who doesn't understand English and took advantage of her to cheat her of the money by withholding the invoice and not drafting any paperwork to substantiate their claims. My next step now is to submit what evidence I have to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services for them to examine. I have attempted many many times to try and work something out with them but to no avail since they decided to play games with us on the matter.   Update: They finally refunded the $500 but not before trying to give us the runaround again, which I obviously refused. Future patrons beware."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum place I've ever been to. There's no carts pushed by waitress, the dim sum is ordered on piece of paper, and it comes out fast,fresh and hot. It's a big banquet hall and its always busy during the weekend."}
{"text":"Rude service and never has the famous BBQ pork buns. Be careful when ordering dim sum items they forget to bring your stuff. Happy dim sum is close by it's cheaper and a lot better."}
{"text":"They sold us 1.5 lb fish but they gave us 1.0 lb fish, if that was even 1.0 lb.  My wife is from a small fishing village and knows her fish size.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter named Homer, he said if the kitchen staff says the fish is 1.5 lbs, then it is 1.5 lbs.  We told him to recheck with the kitchen.  Now the same waiter says this fish is 1.25lbs and was meant for a next table.  My wife told him this is less than 1.25 lbs and told Homer to recheck with the kitchen.     Regardless, something like this should not happen at an expensive restaurant like this.   We are not in a third world nation where a restaurant can get away from cheating the customer like this.     The waiter Homer has not come back yet with the final answer but he and the restaurant ruined our Friday night dinner.    Well the waiter came back with a Fat fresh fish that he claims is 1.5 lbs and says it is the same fish.  The fish we were serve is no where near as far as the fish Homer brought to show us to compare.   Needless to say, we will not be back to this cheater restaurant.  Shame on the cheaters!!!! ================================ Update 02/24/2117  After the bad experience at Blue Lagoon, we searched for a new place to eat Chinese food.  We found a place called Jam House Sea Food restaurant.  My wife and I love it here.  We mainly had dim sum only, but the quality was head and shoulder above all the Chinese restaurants we tried in Mississauga.  The food is clean, fresh and even the staff are flawlessly dressed and friendly (which is very very rare in Chinese restaurants.)  After the blue lagoon fiasco, we are very happy to have found Jam House."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant in Mississauga China Town. All the other restaurants that used to occupy this corner space has been lack luster and hit and misses for stomach aches.   I went with my mom and sister in law for dim sum after trying their bbq pork take out the night before.   The dimsum had flair... most dishes on the menu was standard but with added zest. For example the siu mai (pork meatballs) had dried tako (japanese squid) on top and it was doing the little flakey dance. The shrimp rice noodle roll had some herbs rolled into it and the porridge ($5.50 a bowl) had fish maw... YUM  Also get the fried squid tentacles... yummy and they put it in a fried noodle bowl! Cool  So it's not the best tasting for everything but I appreciate the extra creativeness in the standard fare found in most chinese dim sum restaurants. I can't wait to go back and try out their dinner menu.  Service was hot and cold depending on who you were talking to :)"}
{"text":"I was here having brunch with family and there was a hair moth on our congee. It was disgusting. We told one of the staff,  and he apologizes and cancelled that order. Overall the food was not that great."}
{"text":"Had good but pricey dim sum here and decided to come back for dinner and test the \"seafood\" designation of this restaurant. We actually came back for dinner twice, once in December and once in January. Basically, very good and tasty seafood, well made and nicely presented but pricey. We had the set menu which included lobster and crab. A word of advice, pay an extra $5 and get the chili/pepper/salted crab. It taste better and they give you a larger sized crab. The steamed crab we had the first time was underwelming and seemed small and not live. It was great that if you order a set menu special you pay an extra small fee $9 and get a nice Peking duck with wraps. Service was not great first time. You would expect plates to be cleared and extra hand towels and wipes for a seafood meal but this did not happen.  The second time we went in January service was better. Please, a suggestion. Do away with the red bean desert. For the prices we pay we deserve a better desert."}
{"text":"Fresh dim sum with standard menu options in a nicer atmosphere (banquet hall) than most chinese restaurants. Discounted price if you order before 10:45am. Will happily return."}
{"text":"Food is good but wait time is ridiculous for the food to be served even when it's not crazy busy. Apparently they now only take cash for dim sum...new policy should be placed somewhere or at least mentioned"}
{"text":"Morning Dim Sum before 11am everyday is a great deal!"}
{"text":"If you're gonna come here, I would say go for the seafood because that is what this place specializes in.  We got the peking duck and a 4lb ginger and green onion lobster that were both pretty good.   The peking duck was crispy as always with the awesome pancakes they give. It was $38 as it is a 2 course dish with the leftover duck stir fry that they give which I didn't think was amazing.   The lobster was very good as it had a lot of flavour! If you're going with 4 people, and all are seafood lovers, I would suggest ordering at least 6 lbs of the lobster because I found that 4lbs was very little.....  Overall, good experience but the only thing I would complain about was that it took over 10 min to bring the rice after the lobster came out which sucked because it was getting cold."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon lunch. The food was delicious, but the service....holy crap was it terrible. Servers were everywhere but ours was nowhere to be found. I understand it's busy, I had to call random staff to bring me a plate, sauce, more tea, a pencil to tick my orders, etc. But would I come back? Yes, its great food. I'm a fairly patient person so it is what it is there. I suppose come here if your not in a cranky mood and down for awesome food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday at around 11:30am and was able to get seated promptly. My husband and I went to enjoy some dim sum here on a friend's suggestion and she was right! Service was fast, food was fresh and hot and delicious. Everything was beautifully presented and it was hard to decide whether to Instagram the food or eat it up. I chose to eat it up, and I have no regrets! All the dishes are slightly different from other dim sum places, for example the beef rice rolls have added tangerine peel to them.  This may be my new dim sum place. I definitely want to return to try the main entrees one day, as the lobster looked spectacular!"}
{"text":"Ive been to blue lagoon twice now, one for dimsum and one for dinner so ill write about both experiences.   Walking in you'll notice its brightly lit and very spacious in comparison to alot of other dimsum places, and they had a great tea selection, i usually go with the chamomile. The dim sum is average with the stand fare youd expect at most dimsum places. The dish that really stood out compared to other restaurants is the durian stickrice! Id come back just for that. Its also cheap dimsum if you come early on weekdays.  I also had a great seafood dinner with my family, we ordered lobster, peking duck, and a few vegetable dishes. In comparison to uptown seafood places(omei, fishermans) id give this a 8/10 the claw pieces were a bit salty but the rest of the lobster (cooked three ways) was enjoyable. The dessert that came in the end was lacking and left much to be desired.. sugar syrup and jelly?? I was hoping for atleast a redbean dessert thats standard in most chinese restaurants.  Overall id just come back for Dimsum, but if you dont want to drive all the way uptown then this resto will do."}
{"text":"This is my go to dim sum place even though I'm from downtown. $3.00 s/m/l on Saturday and sunday before 12. Lots of parking too.  Food is always hot and tasty. They don't push the carts around like the ole school way. You order a la cart.   I recommend it. Decor is nice and looks clean."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with parents. For 3 people we ordered the 2 person combo and it was enough.  Along with lobster, we also got fish, vegetable, 2 shark fin,and wet rice? i think it is called? Gave us a free soup when we inquired about the $10 difference between the 2 and 3 person combo.   The place looked very nice.  A nice big open space, but I believe there was a section by the front that was covered up for more privacy.  Presentation of the food was nice too.  Plates they use to serve looked nice, but I think too big lol.  Service was great IMO. Was there about 5:30ish, and more tables arrived after that. There was 2 servers hanging right around us along with 2 other managers walking around. They were very friendly and attentive. Especially when eating the lobster, they came around every so often to give you clean plates.  Even when it got busy later on, they still came around and was not hard to flag someone down when needed.  The only weird part, and why I took a star off, was the food was not hot when it arrived.  Specifically the lobster and fish.  Seemed like it sat there for a while, even though it was not busy. Mentioned it to the manager and he found it strange for the same reason as well.  That took away from the experience and flavor.    Good to see something you don't see much in the area.   Would have to try the dim sum one day.  I  would return, but if temp of the lobster is still an issue, then probably not."}
{"text":"Blue Lagoon is a new additional to the plaza. It is nicely renovated and looks quite luxurious compared to the previous restaurant that was there.   As soon as you enter the premises, you will be presented with a semi-circle wall of fish tanks. Here, you can get a visual representation of all the seafood and fresh ingredients that is served at the restaurant and it looked quite nice.   The restaurant has a very open layout and is decorated with numerous gold accents, such as pillars and wallpapers. There are also televisions are opposite sides of the dining room where customers can enjoy some form of entertainment.   Dim sum wise, pricing may be considered a little pricey, compared to downtown dim sum places. However all dishes have added decorations and some also have unique shapes and sizes. To my opinions, dim sum dishes here is pretty good. Example, spare ribs at normal dim sum places will be mainly savoury, with hints of black pepper taste. At Blue Lagoon, it is a honey base flavour, which is a little different! In a good way, for me! As I sometimes cannot handle the spicy kick from the black peppers. Other dim sum dishes are very cute as well, such as the savoury pork dumplings (???). I really like how the chefs added small decorations to accentuate the presentation of each dish! It was very thoughtful and appealing for customers.   Blue Lagoon is specialized in seafood. If you were to come here for lunch/dinner that is NOT dim sum, I would advice you to take a look at their special menu! You can get some great deals and value from those. I was told that if you order dishes separately, it will be very pricey. Best if you can ask for some suggestions from the supervisor/managers (people in suits) to see if they can offer you any deals or discounts. From my experience, they were very nice and approachable, so I am sure it would not be much of a problem for them to advice you what would be the most valuable options!"}
{"text":"Your standard fare for traditional Chinese cuisine. This is definitely my go-to spot for dim sum and dinner if I am feeling like a fancy Chinese dinner in the Sauga area. I can't say this stuff will change your life but you will leave feeling pretty good on a full stomach. The prices are actually on the low side compared to similar Chinese restaurants in the city.  The dinner menu is vast with a lot of great varieties. Their dim sum menu is pretty large too with a lot of pictures of items which is quite nice for those who can't read the language or don't know what the items are.  The space is open, inviting and clean for Chinese restaurant standards. The service is definitely better than most similar places.  I would recommend this place for dim sum and dinner if you are looking good Chinese food and great value."}
{"text":"Dimsum before 11 is only $2.99/dish all size except XL which is $5.99. The quality of food here is absolutely amazing. Best dimsum, my family and I are regulars here. Basically a sit-down family type style restaurant.  Dimsum after 11 goes to regular price. Not sure of price, but it is a lot cheaper to come before 11.  careful if you come here for dinner though, be ready to pay over $50-100 per person. But it is really good. And they don't skimp out on the expensive ingredients in the soup. My sharkfin soup had LOTS, like huges chunks of it.  ++++recommend.  Dimsum if you're on budget, and if you're ready to pay for the fancy dinner. It really is worth."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here and had some of the best lobsters in a long time!! For sure the Hong Kong style fried lobster was the best! Also had the maggi seasoned lobster - which was ok. Other dishes were fine. I would come back for the hk lobster.   Keep eatin-"}
{"text":"Just came back from there to try their dinner service. My mom tried their dimsum and wasn't too impressed although it was better than most dimsum places in Mississauga.  Honestly I would say it's the best Chinese dinner service in Mississauga. The decor looks amazing inside, there are high ceilings, at least 6 chandeliers, a lot of fancy equipment and plates, covered chairs, and is fairly clean (but it just opened so it better be).  We had a party of 5 people and ordered a 4 person set menu that was about $198 and added on a dish on top of that. It was more than enough for all of us. Gonna go into each dish in detail because that's what I like to do :)  We got some home-y Chinese soup with pieces of beef and chicken and some good ol' random Chinese roots and whatever they put in soups. They were served in individual bowls unlike the usual giant bowl and was very hot. I was told that they made the soups individually as well in those bowls so that was different and interesting.  Next we got a plate of Snow Pea Tips in a fish broth with some dried fish flakes on top. There wasn't much to be honest but it looked very nice and the stems weren't tough. They weren't really that soft either but better than tough and old.  We were then served individual plates of a huge piece of Sea Cucumber, a medium sized Chinese Mushroom and a Goose Foot in I think oyster sauce. Since there was 5 of us we had to split it but the waiter offered to bring another plate for $21.  The next two dishes that came were Deep Fried Oysters and our extra dish, Spicy Deep Fried Squid. I think they were both good, better than other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. Neither were overly coated in batter and they were both very tasty.  Followed by a very long wait for the rest of our food...  Then our Rock Fish came and that was fancy because the soy sauce came in a wine glass. It was very fresh. And our 4lb Lobster came in two dishes: one where the tail was cut up and cooked with green onions and the body was chopped up and steamed in a garlic oil sauce. It was a lot of lobster and it was fairly good.  Lastly, I lied our lobster came in three dishes, we had a seafood soup with rice in it. The Lobster Tomalley was deep fried and put in the soup at the end. I'm not a fan of soup with rice so it was only ok. But it had large pieces of clams so that was very good.  For dessert we got Papaya and Snow Ear soup. Not a fan of papaya so it was only ok.  Overall everything was pretty good considering the standards of Mississauga Chinese dinner service. I would agree that it is very expensive but you are getting the right portions of seafood. If you are looking for a cheaper price though you should head up to Markham or Richmond Hill but if that's not accessible to you then this place will absolutely do. Make sure you order the set dinner menus! They are more worth than ordering separately always."}
{"text":"Im at the restaurant right now and the SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! its like they only cater to large familes and treat other people like shit. Tried asking questions about the food to two waiters and they literally just walked away in the middle of my sentence. And the others just walked by. AND OUR FOOD IS TAKING FOREVER TO COME OUT. RAGE."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and ordered a 2lb lobster (that is the minimum), birds nest with shrimp, scallops and squid, choy sum with king oyster mushrooms, sweet and sour pork and Peking duck in two ways. The food was underwhelming, the birds eat and Peking duck did not have any flavour. One needed more rice wine while the other needed to be fried a bit more as the skin was soggy for the wraps. The sweet and sour pork had a thick coating and had a smokey flavour due to the wok but it was one of the better dishes. The veggies had a thick brown sauce that was poured over the mushrooms but had no taste. However the lobster was okay. Regarding service, much more upscale than a usual Chinese restaurant however we had to wait 15 minutes for our bowls of rice which I didn't understand. This then made our food get cold. Overall, for a $200 meal, I expected better. I would make the drive to Markham or Scarborough to get better food at a more decent price."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks really nice and fancy but at 6pm on a Thursday night we were basically the only family there! The food was decent but wasn't mind-blowing and I feel like they're wanting to copy Fisherman's Lobster House but just doesn't quite nail it (i.e. king crabs and fried lobster tower). They also do not have set menus for family dinners.   Overall the food was good and they let my kids run around for a bit without complaining which is also a plus!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't write reviews but really disappointed here. Scathing review deserved.   Food was mediocre and service was despicable. We ordered a Peking Duck entrée  which came in two dishes and portions were so small they were laughable. We ordered beef rice noodles and get this, 15 mins later they tell us they're out of it. Seriously, what restaurant has that problem? No problem... Move on. When presented with the bill, we were charged a corking fee despite the fact that we brought nor drank no wine. We called them out on it and they corrected it. Really?!  With so many good restaurants across Mississauga and the GTA, save yourself frustration and money. Find a place that is more reputable."}
{"text":"food: pretty decent (the entire place as a whole was extremely fancy) price: ehhh, a bit below average (60$ for 3 dishes) service: mediocre, we had to go up for any requests, they never came to us.   rating: ***/*****  a bit too expensive"}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day dinner. We knew it was going to be a busy night for the restaurant so we expected slow service.  We have come to blue lagoon many times before since it is one of the most decent chinese restaurants in the area: but tonight's experience made us decide not to come back ever again!  Food: because it was mothers day, the restaurant made you to order from their \"special mothers day\" menu; which are all expensive set courses. So you stuck with ordering crabs and lobsters  ( min $250+ for 4 ppl ). Service: no service.  No tea, no water, took 20 mins to finally order the food. Waited 20+ mins for EACH dish to come out. Still no tea, no water. The food came out so slow we decided to get the last few dishes to go. When we asked for the bill we asked if we can get the regular dessert that came with the food; they never come. Although it did take the server less than one minute to get the bill! Aviod this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a new Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, and it is located in the Mississauga China Town. The restaurant's location was emptied for years. I think this is the only place that is targeting high-end customers so far in Mississauga.  As you can get what they are specialized by reading the restaurant name, SEAFOOD!!! When I first walked in, it reminded me of the Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant in Scarborough, but not as high-end looking as the one in Scarborough, just my opinions. This Seafood Master also has a lot of aquariums near the entrance, but the numbers are not as many as the Fishman Lobster. One thing I like is the restaurant has bright lighting and have some nice tables and chairs.  The service was a oooooookie, but for this kind of price, I am expecting more and more professionally. The waitresses seem kind of lost, maybe because they are new. For example, the manager told them to give X, Y, and Z to our table, but the waitresses were running around not hearing what he said and came back asking what we want instead.  The utensils were kind of dirty, I don't know who washed it or how new was this person washing dishes, but I have a spoon, a fork, and chopsticks that had something that stick to them. If they are running high-end, they should consider cleaning them properly...  For the taste of the food, I just have to say, it was not as good as the Fishman Lobster Clubhouse in Scarborough, but everything is fresh."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill! We went for dim sum on Friday. We have been there several times in the past and generally enjoyed our visits.  The service, quality and taste of every dishes were below par. First dim sum dish appeared almost 20 mins after we ordered.  It was lukewarm. The next six dishes were also lukewarm and the quality were really very average. We had to send one of the deep fried dish back because it was cold,,,.they promised to replace it but we we waited over 10 mins and decided to finally cancel it.  Overall a negative visit and we didn't enjoy our lunch, We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. The ambience is really inviting too. I ordered the duck and they actually cut it and serve it in front of you. Prices can be over the normal upwards in the thousands when ordering king crabs or lobsters."}
{"text":"Standard fair Chinese restaurant. Notable things: - Get the ice sweet and sour pork. It is amazing and really unique. Somehow the ice makes it crispier. - They cut their Peking duck poorly when I was there. The pieces were strictly skin.. Need a bit of fat/meat on there. Summit Garden's Peking duck is definitely better. - They play A Bite Of China on loop on the four huge projector screens in the restaurants, which is hilarious and awesome."}
{"text":"Pros: Lots of dim sum items to choose from Food comes out pretty quickly  Cons: Service is hit or miss  Came here with some friends and their little ones for Sunday morning dim sum. Blue Lagoon is located in Chinatown-esque plaza.  The plaza has the whole pagoda theme going for it.    Like most Chinese dim sum places, there's a happy hour special if you come before 11am.  All S, M, and L dim sum are $2.89 if you order during happy hour.  The menu has a lot of items to choose from.  We had 6 adults and 4 kids with us so we ordered a decent amount of dishes.    When the guy comes to pick up our order, he tells us that we've ordered too much and we shouldn't order so much.  He said you won't finish all of it.  This is the 2nd time such a thing has happened to me and I don't get it.  Who are you to tell us how much to order?  We pay for it all and if we don't finish, we take it to go.  I don't understand why we should have to take some things off our order.   After we place out orders, the food comes out rather quickly.  We ordered about 20-25 dim sum dishes and I think everything was brought within 20 minutes of ordering.  The dim sum itself was pretty standard.  A little different in terms of prep but mostly what you would expect coming out for dim sum.    Halfway through the meal, we wanted to get dome more tea.  They have the remote system here where you push buttons for service.  We pushed the buttons and waited, and waited some more.  We sat there without tea or water for a good 20 minutes.  In the end, we got up and hailed someone to get what we needed.  When it was time for the bill and we hit the bill button, lo and behold they were there lightning quick.  If I lived in Mississauga, I could see myself coming here again.  Not being that close, it's too much of a trek.  I'm hoping our experience was an abooration more than anything when it came to the service."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Loved the BBQ pork buns. The King Crab (not on the dim sum menu) was the bomb!   We came on a Sunday at 11am so we didn't have to wait too long but it also meant that the dim sum was more expensive. Time is money so worth it!   Service was typical for a dim sum place; they get you in, they get you out. Wham bam thank you ma'am! But I'll be back for the lobster."}
{"text":"To be honest, it was nice to see variations on all the dimsum classics, but while we were eating them we kinda wished we had the regular original dish instead"}
{"text":"3.5-4*  Riddle:  What spreads through the Chinese community quicker than \"Guess who got into Med school?\" or \"Guess who got divorced?\"  Answer:  The newest, decent Chinese restaurant with Happy Hour!  Enter Blue Lagoon Seafood Master, located at the Mississauga Chinatown.  Sorta like the city's answer to Scarborough's popular, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant. Could this place be the saviour of this dying tourist stop??  I only went for dim sum, so I'm not sure what they offer in terms of their dinner menu.  Monday - Friday, they have Happy Hour before 11am.  So that means you should arrive well BEFORE 11 so you have time to do all your ordering, allow wait time for the food to arrive, then eat it.  Most dishes are $2.60/plate, with the exception of \"special dishes\".  Most of the items that I ordered were above average in the city.  I found the steamed items not as good.  The wrapping tasted as though it was over/twice steamed.  More attention than usual were paid to plating and presentation.  Dim sum for 2 ppl was approx. $30 for 8 plates, including a coupla dishes that were $6.50/ea.  Servers were plentiful, cheerier and helpful than other places.  Would go to and recommend for anyone who wants to do dim sum in the 'ssauga!"}
{"text":"Since my last review in 2015, they are under new management, which in this case, it's not a bad thing. Not that they weren't good before, but the good stay good and then some. This would be the second dinner I've had since they've changed hands. They kept most of the staff, so service at that ends is no problem. The captains have changed and they are very good. Professional yet still very friendly. I feel like they've kept most of the chefs and possibly hired some new ones who are even better at what they do. We do not eat spicy food and it's always a concern when we ask restaurants to skip the spice because they tend to become very bland. To our surprise, they remain very tasty even after they have to change the seasoning. When ordering the steamed fish, asking them to stream it laying down flat will come out better tasting than their standard way of cooking them. Definitely a place we'll keep coming back. p.s. Their BBQ shop next door sells some of their famous dim sum frozen. Do visit them."}
{"text":"Seafood is fresh crabs are awesome prices are high as expected.  I came here early on a Saturday for dim sum.  Not the greatest I had better at better prices.  Service wise if you're not Chinese you get over looked a lot.  Communication gap tends to be the problem with a restaurant like this.  When you get paid on a Friday definitely come out and enjoy some good seafood"}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum, it gets busy since there are not a lot of dimsum places near by.  Food is ok, nothing to write home about. Their current promo is spend 25$ between 11-4 and you can order lobster  e-fu noodles for 20.88"}
{"text":"This place is famous for its lobsters but I am not a fan of lobsters so......*tsk tsk tsk* yea....I know I've missed out!!  Anyways, I'd rather enjoyed the roast duck and the steamed fish a lot. The roast duck that I had was dangerously good!  It was one juicy bird, very very tender in the meat, and I loved the duck fat!  I was sure the lobsters were good though as my husband and other family members were licking their fingers LOL.  The Yangzhou (or Yeung Chow) fried rice, prepared in a pyramid shape, looked cute and was flavorful.  Last but not least, the complimentary dessert, Papaya and snow ear fungus sweet soup, was not too sweet, and my mom loved it and just kept talking about it for 2 days hahaa :P"}
{"text":"First off, only 2 or 3 people can speak/understand English. All the dim sum ladies do not speak or understand English at all. You will not get sauces from them, clarify what they just brought to your table, and you will not be able to order anything with them. Seemingly, their sole role is to bring dim sum out. Period.   The two guys/hosts speak English and they were the only people who understood fully what we requested.   Menu is in English and Vietnamese but they have so many items and it was obvious the tiny font was because they wanted to squeeze everything on one page. You mark down the quantity you want, make sure to only fill one per table to not confuse the kitchen and to keep track of your order.   F O O D :  Cheese wontons: oil was definitely old and it was nauseating to eat  Chicken feet had such little meat on them, it was just sad for many reasons.  Char siu buns/ baked BBQ pork buns: the buns were too dough-y and seemed undercooked  Siu mai/pork+shrimp: meaty and juicy  Egg tarts: bland  Har gow: bland  Banh cuon tom/shrimp rice noodle: bland and shrimp was fishy  Banh cuon char siu/char siu rice noodle: nobody touched  Vegetable rice noodles: we didn't order but dim sum server said to just keep it  Spareribs: wayyyy overcooked, was mushy  Curry squid: too chewy  Congee: baby liked it  Beef tripe: decent, not too chewy  Bo vien/Beef balls: bland  Egg yolk bun: bland! How?!  Mango pudding in fish-shaped form: the only item really enjoyed   Never received: steamed pork buns, second order of baked BBQ buns, pork tripe  This was disappointing. I worked in a dim sum restaurant -besides helping myself to dim sum, I also learned how dim sum service and taste should be executed. This was horrible. Food was delayed and when we asked about it, the host or another lady wearing a different colored vest would say the food is coming. 40 minutes later, when we were almost done eating, stacks of dim sum came to our table. We had over 6 orders of chicken feet, 4 orders of har gow, some random leek dumplings. We were still missing some orders but we were horrified at the amount of food they had placed on our table. The lady in the vest insisted we had ordered them all. What...   A lot of things were lost in communication due to language barrier. We didn't receive some items and we received more items than what we ordered. The bill calculated probably wasn't correct.   I also noticed the dim sum ladies were burning their hands as they carried the orders to the table. Is there not a less harmful way of serving dim sum?! Such as mandatory use of trays or even carts? The whole restaurant wasn't in use, why not clear some space so carts can be navigated ?!   Also, asking for more sauce (soy sauce/sirarcha/chili oil)  was akin to me asking my sister for my clothes back. Carries out the request by only giving one item back and ignoring the following repeated requests. Also, lady in vest only gave three sauces on a small plate for a table of 15. What. Asians share a lot but when it comes to sauces, come now. It's hard to share that.   Dining here was just awkward and exasperating. I've never experienced such bland food and hair-wrenching service. There were some good moments when Homer and the other host got us more sauces/cleared out plates/checked on our orders, clarified items that were brought to our table.   Return? Nah, bruh."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Lagoon this morning for weekend dim sum. Hadn't been to the plaza in years (maybe 15+) but they've re-opened and the renovations are nice. All items are $2.88 (s,m,l) if you order before 11am. We arrived at 10am to get a table and didn't have to wait. Had we arrived 15 minutes later, the wait could've been 30 mins+, so best to arrive early! The food service was a bit slow at first but the quality was good, especially for the price. Will definitely return for dim sum again and interested in trying their dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Mississauga for sure...everything we had was quite good. Rice roll was tasty and firm, yet soft. We ordered about 9 items, would order them all again...next time I want dimsum I'll come here rather then going all the way downtown to Rol San"}
{"text":"Upon entering the Blue Lagoon restaurant, it is brightly lit, more a 300-seating hall then a restaurant. There is a giant screen with a projector displaying specials and enticing images of sea food. Such a large restaurant but throughout dinner there were only 30 people seated.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  We ordered the seafood platter for 3 that started with Chicken feet soup which was excellent, Sea cucumber (a bit over cooked).  A giant huge mountain of battered and fried lobster came and steamed Green Bass. The lobster was fantastic and very well made and presented. The Green bass was however lacked seasoning and flavor, it was floating in a bed of soy sauce which you had to dip into to get any flavor. It just did work well.  The Rice and seafood soup was the next item which was delicious but very filling after all of this.  Dessert arrived and we were not able to get an explanation of it, it looking like lychee in liquid gelatin. It lacked taste and imagination, would not recommend that again. Throughout dinner communication was a bit difficult.  There was an issue with the billing, they overcharged us for the fish and has told us that the bass is larger, and we said ok, it is part of the menu. At the end, the server's behavior left a bad taste in my mouth and in my opinion not worth the disrespectful end of the meal service that we got. The server told my father that he didn't mention the price because its common sense!  The food was excellent but an empty restaurant adding extra to your bill is poor practice. I tried to speak to the owner after dinner, but he was not interested in listening to me. Perfect opportunity went wrong."}
{"text":"Went here today for dim sum.  Dim sum here is a bit different... no push cart service, just order your dishes off a menu. The food is ok... what stands out is the presentation of their food.  Food quality itself is average... for dim sum.  Service was quite slow and it only got worse when there was a power outage. No one came by to see if we needed anything.  The restaurant staff seemed a bit disarray and kept to themselves.  It was a weird experience.  When we asked for containers for take out... that came quickly... however to pay the bill was a different story.  They said that they can manually calculate it... we were fine with that and we were able to pay cash.  30mins latr we ended up going to the front and asked for the bill again  URG... they forgot about us.  We could have just walked out and no one would have noticed.  Sometimes being honest does not pay."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for early morning dim sum. The early bird special is $1.80 a dish. The food is always fresh and not too salty.   My parents live nearby where a quick decision for afternoon tea is always a quick decision.   We ordered the congee, one of my favourites and each time it never fails to impress me. My other favourite dish is the steamed spare ribs. It's cooked with pumpkin and black bean.   The service is average where they have wait staff for tea, clearing of tables, typical service requests and then good staff who just bring out food. Those staff just bring out food and don't take any service request. The. Menu has a wide variety of options. From your typical dim sum to stir fry dishes.   What makes it convenient is the location where you are able to eat, buy BBQ takeout and in the same plaza you can pick up groceries and household goods.   This restaurant overall is a favourite."}
{"text":"Fancy banquet hall style dim sum restaurant. Large display TV, high ceiling and luxurious linens and decor. Not a casual dim sum restaurant but definitely a place to WOW your guests if they are trying dim sum for the first time.   Also recommended as a place to bring parents for birthday/celebration lunch.  Love the specialty crafted dim sum and Koi mango pudding!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Blue Lagoon Seafood Master. We had been to the restaurant that used to be in this location several times before and really enjoyed the dim sum (and the low prices).  Our first impression was that this was an extremely busy restaurant. We arrived at around noon on a Sunday and I think there were only 1 or 2 empty tables even though it's a HUGE place. We figured this was a really good sign and sat down anticipating a great meal. A waiter arrived right away and dropped off a teapot and 2 cups and handed us a pencil and order sheet. This is the style of dim sum restaurant where you order from a list of dishes on a sheet of paper, rather than flagging down people pushing carts filled with food.  So the first reason for my 2-star review is that we waited a minimum of 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order sheet. This was after the 10 minutes where we had sat and decided upon what we wanted.  We then waited another 10 minutes before any food arrived. The first thing to arrive was the deep-fried taro with minced pork. It tasted great but was colder than lukewarm, so we were off to a disappointing start. About 5 minutes later our congee with pork ribs and dried oyster arrived. It was barely lukewarm and although it tasted okay, we weren't offered any Sriracha sauce, white pepper, soya sauce or any other condiments that we're usually offered when we're in a dim sum restaurant.   Next to arrive were the har gow (shrimp dumplings) and they were lovely hot and tasted great. However, they delivered (and charged us for) 2 servings although we only ordered 1. The scallop dumplings came next and although they tasted great, they were actually shrimp dumplings with a TINY piece of scallop on top.  We also ordered fried turnip cakes with minced octopus. They were 'meh'. This is a dish we've literally ordered hundreds of times in many restaurants and I'd say these were among the worst ones we've tasted.    We also ordered beef tendon, which arrived hot and was quite tasty. It was served with some konjac noodles (2 small bundles).   The bill arrived and we realized that the prices were quite high compared to most dim sum places in the area. We also were charged for the tea (which we didn't order) which is highly unusual for any of our local Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese or Japanese restaurants. The total of the bill was $37 for the two of us.  I understand that this restaurant is also open in the evenings for regular menu items (non dim sum), but we haven't tried those so I can't comment on them. But as it stands I honestly can't see us returning."}
{"text":"We were craving dimsum and decided to try it out Sunday morning. We didn't realize before 12 on weekends is $3 for s/m/l. The dimsum tastes average nothing spectacular. The shrimp rice rolls, har gow, and egg tarts were my fav. The egg tarts were on the smaller side but tasted fresh. The congee tasted very plain, not much flavour. Service is very average for a dimsum place, you have to wave down the servers if you need something."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got one of their set lunch specials. It said it was for 2, but it was enough for the 3 of us. It came with lobster, abalone e-fu noodles, and sea cucumber congee. The lobster was pretty decent, as was the noodles, the sea cucumber was sort of flavourless. Service was quick, and the presentation was decent. Will most likely go back to try their king crab dishes."}
{"text":"First of all this place looked super nice and fancy.  The price range however, was a little pricey.  The food was okay and definitely is not worth the price you are paying. They do not give you a huge portion as you would expect to get from other chinese restaurants.  I've had food that taste the same as this place for a cheaper price with a lot more food.  Service was terrible, they're rude and look like they hate their life.  Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese restaurant but the food was just okay for dim sum. I went another time for dinner and that was great but quite a bit more expensive because of the seafood menu!  Over 30 options to choose from on the \"ticking\" menu and a good variety.   Usually this restaurant is really busy so there are times that the service is slower - I had to check in 3 times about my egg tarts and it still took 30 minutes more than all the other food. They also asked us if we needed forks at the very start which could be a sign of good service or a little offensive and since we didn't need forks, I felt a little miffed.   Still a good place to eat if you don't mind how loud it is and that you definitely will not be done in an hour!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, this place is very visually appealing.  With the use of high-rise ceilings, large chandeliers, and very detailed-oriented designs, it really goes to show how hard they tried and succeeded at building a new type of dim sum experience here in the GTA.    The food here on the other hand is average at best, it's not the best, but not offensively the worst.  The pricing is pretty good if you make it in early and beat the line-ups.  Unfortunately for me, I came on family day where it was regular pricing (as is for all national holidays).  I've been here for a wedding reception once, but the food was not dim-sum (obviously), and was still pretty average.    The service here is what you would expect from a dim-restaurant.  No-frills, just order and go type of service.  I do, however appreciate their ease of ordering and receipt system as it makes it very easy to keep track of your orders (and the budget).    Crowds get crazy here, as mentioned earlier... There was a fight between a young man, and an elderly woman who claimed he tried to pick-pocket her purse.  Moral of the story, come early or be prepared to suffer in the wrath of bargain-hunting asians (me included lol)!!!"}
{"text":"***Entrance is NOT stroller friendly! There's no easy way to push your stroller up the 6\" curb. There is a change table in the handicap bathroom in the ladies bathroom, but like all Asian restaurant bathrooms, the space is filthy with urine and toilet paper all over the place*** and the sad part, this is one of the BETTER restaurants in Mississauga. The dim sum is excellent, dinner can be pricy compared to other Asian cuisine fare ($80 for 4 people, service was super slow as it took 30 minutes to get the second half of our order)."}
{"text":"We headed this place for dim sum, it's new and well furnished. Probably the best furnished restaurant for having dim sum in Mississauga. The food was okay, but the waitresses are slow at everything, we ordered 6 dishes, 2 of them were not served for a long time and we ask to cancel the 2 dishes, and they mess up The bill."}
{"text":"Finally a higher end dim sum place in Mississauga!  Located in the unofficial Mississauga Chinatown near Dundas and Cawthra. This is the flagship restaurant in this mall.  From the moment you walk in you can feel the upscaleness of this place from the decor.   Now to the food.  One word: Excellent! See my pics!  Slightly pricier compared to the other places but is justified by the quality and size of the dim sum servings.  One tip is to come for dim sum pricing special by 11:30am in order to join the lineup at the door, get your table and to place your order by 12pm for the dim sum pricing specials of everything priced as a small item of $2.80.  A word of warning, do not come at 11:55am like we did once because there was a line up at the door with like minded diners who were also after the same deal. By the time we got seated at 12pm, we missed the deal as the order has to be placed by 12pm........"}
{"text":"This is apparently a fairly new restaurant in the Mississauga area, just the latest in a slew of Chinese restaurant which have occupied this location. Maybe that contributes to the fact that the menu is on the small side in terms of options,  I came here for dinner on a Sunday night with my family. Despite it being a seafood restaurant, we actually only ordered one seafood dish (steamed fish), along with Peking duck, cashew chicken, steamed vegetable, and half a chicken. I will say though that I saw some of the fried lobster or crab dishes come out and they looked very appetizing. Overall I thought the quality of the food was good though - the only dish that was a bit iffy for me was the cashew chicken, which was tasty but a bit on the salty side. The Peking duck was pretty good quality I would say, and the doughy wraps they gave us were great. We actually ended up getting a second platter of just the wraps, which was $5. They present their duck in the most unique way, they kind of hang it up on this post thing so it looks like it is being crucified while they slice away at it. Kind of interesting, plus at least it draws the attention of other patrons and makes lots of people want to order duck. Staff were really attentive and it was evident they were trying really hard to impress with their customer service, given that this is a new place. Food also came quickly, which was a plus. The venue is also quite nice - very high ceilings and lots of chandeliers, less of a traditional Chinese restaurant feel, but pleasant all the same. Overall I had a good dinner here, would go again, hopefully this place will be able to stay in business here."}
{"text":"Blue Lagoon Seafood Master serves traditional Chinese cuisine, including seafood, BBQ, and daily dim sum. I have been on several occasions for their seafood menu (and Peking duck), but it was first time trying their dim sum menu. They recently added two new dim sum dishes inspired by the popular trend from Hong Kong; cartoon dim sum. Both the Piggy Shaped Buns and Green Eyed Monsters Buns are now available during Blue Lagoon Seafood Master dim sum hours.    Both cartoon dim sums were egg yolk buns containing a generous amount of egg yolk inside. The buns were a good combination of savory and salty. The novelty of the buns was that you need to poke a hole with your chopsticks, and then squeeze the bun for the egg yolk to squirt out. They are definitely a great photo-op for social media, but remember to do it fast, as the egg yolk hardens. Blue Lagoon Seafood Master will have a limited supply per day, so go early to ensure that you get to try some. Overall, I found the portions to be pretty generous, and they definitely do not skimped out on the fillings for the dumplings, and buns. Dim sum is available everyday from 9 am to 4 pm.   Also, don't forget to check their extensive seafood menu including my favorite dish, the Hong Kong-style lobster. Their Peking Duck was crispy and delish!!"}
{"text":"Seriously this is THE WORST place to try and book a wedding came in about a week ago and we discussed to book a wedding here with the manager or supervisor who talked with us showed us the different wedding dinner options,pricing etc I was suppose to get a call after he said he would discuss the price we negotiated on with his managers yet NO FKN CALL! I called back a week after they said to come in to talk in person yet I told them we already went twice to discuss this,the guy on the phone said to come in to talk to the managers this is a really UNORGANIZED AND UNPROFESSIONAL restaurant business these people can't even give me a quote over the damn phone.   (I called back today before I had to come there to talk to them the guy on the phone I think was the supervisor said the manager is busy after I asked to talk to him and the supervisor just said to call back after? What the fk is this?! Don't even bother to ask for my name or number?)  This place ONLY accepts cash no cards,and the lack of English is seriously bad  Also when I was here last week we accidentally ordered to much we asked if we could cancel a few items yet they still brought it out for us this is ridiculous  Honestly DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO EAT HERE THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER AND CHEAPER DIM SUM PLACES IN THE GTA. This place is a waste of time  So ended up going back today to talk to the manager and wow what a WASTE of fkn time he said he didn't get a chance to talk to his managers so he'll call me back next week, what a waste of my fkn time for this.  DO NOT EAT HERE,do not book any birthdays,weddings etc they will just turn you down and not do anything about it such a garbage place and unorganized,unprofessional managers and employees  If I could rate 0 I would never HAVE I had such horrible horrible customer service I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS SHT HOLE OF A RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Saturday around noon. Relative to other dim sim restaurants, the food was good, price slightly higher than average, and this place was more comfortable in terms of atmosphere - it was cleaner and seemed more spacious (the high ceiling helped).  I would get the mango salad roll again.   Taste:  4/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Value for Money: 3/5 Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"Went to dim sum this morning. Ordered curry cutlet, squid, siomay , steam rice and tea.  I have to wait 15 minutes and food arrived one by one. The food looking good but unfortunately they need salt and pepper."}
{"text":"Came by on a Monday (family day 2018) for breakfast as a party of 4 around 1045am thinking we would get the happy hour deal but NOPE. Printed sheets stuck everywhere saying Family Day all dim sum dishes are regular price. So whatever, we drove all the way here and decided to stay and eat. It didn't take very long to get seated and we were placed near the back. The restaurant is very grand and there's no surprise that bunch of parties would be hosted here. The time we went, it wasn't that busy but it took forever for us to get our food. I swear the interval of each dish coming was prob 6-8 minutes and we ordered only 7.   Food was decent. Service could have been better."}
{"text":"4/5 only if you come for the early bird special. If not, it becomes expensive. It is probably the best dim sum in sauga imo. As their name suggests, they specialize in seafood so you should definitely give those dishes a try. If you're coming with a large party, or just have visitors over and want to treat them to a good meal, this would be the place to go. I've had family friends wow-ed by the lunch lobster dishes, and combined with their dim sum, it leaves everyones stomach happy and in a food coma afterwards.   The place is grand itself. Plenty of tables, but even then they're all occupied during the early bird special and you have people standing outside waiting with their dim sum selections checked off and ready to hand to the waiters/waitresses once they get seated.   I'm a fan of their steamed rice noodles and their deep fried sesame balls. They're sooo good.   Have yet to come here for dinner but I'm sure any of their set lobster/seafood dinner specials will blow me away."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here. The food is just heavenly. My favorited a are Roasted suckling pig, Lobster cooked in garlic Hongkong style, broccoli in garlic and crispy fried noodles in seafood and veggie sauce.  I come here because the food is fresh and quality is consistent!  The birthday cake was delicious too! The restaurant is a huge hall with round tables good to fit 500 guests.  Noise level is high because the place is always full. Sounds of people chattering and crystal dining ware.  Huge parking is available in front and at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's wedding reception. Just before they started serving food the power went out for a few minutes.   They were serving beer and my husband asked what kind of beer they had available. Waitress says let me check, comes back with an opened Budweiser and ask him if Bud is okay. I guess he didn't really have a choice.  My husband and 2 friends are allergic to seafood so there were only 4 courses out of 10 they could eat. My husband was going to wait for the 4 courses he could eat.   My two friends with seafood allergies asked for a veggie alternative dish.  Once the yummy looking veggie dish arrived my friend with an Epipen was about to eat it. Luckily my other friend questioned if the brown sauce on the veggies was fish or oyster sauce- waitress said she would ask.  She came back and said yes.  They had to send the dish back because the sauce could have killed them!   Meanwhile,  the chicken course my husband could eat finally arrived. The server served the  chicken with the SAME SERVING SPOON SHE SERVED EVERY OTHER SEAFOOD DISH WITH. Therefore he couldn't eat that either. He asked  if it was too late to ask for the veggie dish. Waitress said she would ask. SHE NEVER CAME BACK to tell him if he could have the alternative dish. So basically my husband literally ate a few pieces of duck over a 10 course meal.  They didn't even give us a piece of cake from the bride and groom. They served 4 pieces to a table of 12 people and never came back.   My poor husband went home and ate McDonald's instead.    Such awful service. The tables were already packed with 10 people with barely any room and they forced 2 more people to sit at our table. I barely had any room to sit and reach the table. I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for dim sum. Up until 11 AM dim sum is sold at a discount. Dim sum is prepared individually for you and brought to your table once it is ordered. Unlike a lot of dim sum restaurants, it does not come off a steam cart.  At night, it is a high class seafood restaurant. Love the tanks with live fish, king crabs and lobsters.You can also order takeout BBQ from a separate entrance."}
{"text":"We had the king crab and giant  lobster here. The king crab we had them cook 4 ways. Fried in 2 different styles, steamed and made into a fried rice. The King crab is over the double the price of the lobster per pound but tasted like same as the lobster when fried and coated with same seasoning. So my recommendation is if you gonna get both crab and lobster have the crab steamed, it does taste better cook this way, you can taste the natural sweetness more. I wasn't crazy about the other stir fried dishes but i guess your here for the seafood. The bill came to around $650 for 6 adults and 2 kids. For what you get I don't think its worth it and the food was not amazing."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A TOTAL SCAM! THEY CHEAT - THEY WILL CHARGE YOU MORE AND GIVE YOU LESS FOR THEIR SEAFOOD. READ on...  So we used to like this place when it first opened a couple of months ago. We went a lot until we realized they were scamming us.  We had gone here maybe about 8 times even introducing friends and family here too. There aren't many Chinese seafood restaurant in the area.   One night we purchased 4 lbs lobster takeout. We were buying something else at another shop near there, they looked at our takeout and asked how much we paid for it and we told them and they said that's a lot for 3lbs. We told them 4 so they weighed it for us, in front of us and it was 3lbs. After cooking the weight should go up not down since it was fried.   PAID 4 lbs RECEIVED 3 lbs  By the way, lobsters are paid by the pounds and each pound is 17.99.  We were really disappointed because we have gone here before and called the manager. Manager said oh come back and we will give you the 1 lb.  We came back after 1 month for dinner with friends tonight. We told the waitress what the manager said. Waitress told us \"oh we changed manager, so we can't do that\". Then they refused to take our order for 25 minutes. Until we got really upset and demanded that they take our order. Then they brought out a 5 lb lobster and said we will only charge you 4 lb.   We realized though...that it was NOT a 5 lb lobster that they cooked. We now go to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse in Markham where the service is 10000x better and the food is so much cheaper and the portions are accurate! If you order a 5 lb at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse versus Blue Lagoon, you will realize that Blue Lagoon is a total SCAM! Fishman is a 45 minutes drive for us but we would rather go there for honest seafood than here.   I am completely disappointed in how this place is ran. If they had simply charged me  more per pound but actually give the correct # of pounds when I order, I wouldn't be so disappointed. They just want to appear well priced when they are not and trying to cheat their customers.   When they first opened their service was quick, but now they can't handle the volume and it takes forever, expect a 45 min to 1h wait for food.   I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Do NOT go unless of course you like to pay more than what you get.   So sad to say...this place gives Asian restaurants a bad reputation (and yes I am Asian)."}
{"text":"The presentation looked better than it taste.  Much of the dishes we ordered were too salty. And the others were bland.  We ordered some dim sum dishes through menu rather than the push cart. Maybe because it was weekday and that was the process.   Service was slow, food took awhile to come but at least it was hot when it came.  They have dishes and set meal with awesome presentation but also pricier. Not sure if I would try the pricier menu as the flavours of what we ordered was not to my liking."}
{"text":"Bad service at front desk very passive aggressive staff at front taking phone calls.  Puts our table of 12 by the back room where the staff goes in and out every 3 to 4 mins making one of my family members move her chair every time they go in and out! Worse dim sum experience ever. Food was just alright for the price and service you get."}
{"text":"I have only been here for dim sum which I quite like. The space is clean, well maintained and roomy compared to most Chinese restaurants. The prices are a bit on the high side but if you come during their morning happy hour (before 11am) it's a steal!  As of late they seem to be changing their menu up a little and cutting out some of the more \"special\" items, likely due to the fact that they were too labour intensive, which is a shame. Service varies depending on the server/staff but it's no worse than most Chinese restaurants. I will keep coming back (for happy hour) because the food is good quality."}
{"text":"Our family considers this to be the top dim sum place now in Mississauga.  Quality is super good.  Portions are generous.  Plus the selection is more extensive and offers some items you don't normally see.  For eg. Baked crusty BBQ pork buns, anti-traditional spring rolls, very succulent chicken feet, pear shaped and crispy pork tasties.  Their fried vermicelli with conpoy is also very good and must be eaten with the chilli oil.    However their specials for dim sum is over by 12pm everyday so you need to go and line up before that.  But don't go at 11:45, because they usually have a huge line up albeit them getting the people in quickly.  The order form needs to go in before 12, otherwise the special does not apply.  So 11am would be a better time.    Their Peking duck and Alaskan crabs are also great but that's for dinner.    We frequent this resto at least twice or thrice a month."}
