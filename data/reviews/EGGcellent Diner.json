{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times for breakfast.  The decor isn't the best but the friendly staff certainly make up for it.  We tend to be healthy eaters and this place offers turkey bacon and even oatmeal which is such a treat as its not offered in most places.  We are very fussy about our eggs and they are always cooked to perfection.  We have never been disappointed and would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a friendly place with great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Pancakes are good. 
Eggcellent value during the week days."}
{"text":"Word. Hospitality here is unreal. Way too chills and sweet. Real good ppl working here. Tried the California Eggs Benny; good stuff:) smoked salmon, how can u go wrong. But yeah.got hit even if you ain't from there. They representing that good Canadian hospitality."}
{"text":"Would give this zero stars if possible. I've been here twice now, and both times I've been disappointed. Let me start by saying I used to work at a breakfast place, so I know how things can go.. but this was unlike anything I have ever experienced. 
The first time, I got takeout and there was a huge black hair right on top of my eggs. Don't know how that went unnoticed... 
I recently decided to give this place another chance. And this is where it gets really bad. 
I got to the restaurant with my parents at 11am on a Saturday. Giving myself plenty of time before I had to be at work for 12:30. It wasn't too busy, lots of dirty tables needing to be cleaned, so looks like we missed a big rush. A table of 6 or 7 came in at the same as us. There were 2 servers, and the one girl took both of us. She brought our drinks and then went to take the other tables food order (they were right next to us) and then she came and took our food order. About 45 minutes passed and we still didn't have our food. The other table who came at the same time were over half way finished everything. The server came up to us and said \"you've gotten your food, right?\" I couldn't believe she actually asked that.. that's a sure sign that she's forgotten our order. It's 12:20, I'm going to be late for work, so my dad gets up and tells her that we've waited way too long and we need to go. \"Are you sure, your food is almost ready\", isn't that always the case?? As we're walking out I can hear the girl yelling in the back to someone \"I did put the order in!!\" I highly doubt that. And then my mom slipped on food that was in the middle of the floor, she fell, hit her head on the wall and hurt her ankle. A guy from the table next to us got up and yelled back to one of the servers. She sprained her ankle, and has bruises on her knee, arm, and ear. 
The owner should consider hiring more servers if these two girls can't handle that amount of people by themselves.. 
By far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Will never go back."}
{"text":"We ordered California smoke salmon Benedict and big breakfast. Food served in good temperature and the staffs are very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"What my spouse loved about this place:

1- friendly service
2- fast service
3- good coffee
4- nice music
5- hot food
6- ketchup bottle was chilled

The 5 star breakfast was nice and made to order.  The only drawback is the bacon was a bit over cooked. No big deal.  Prices are reasonable.  The wife said she will try the eggs Benedict next time."}
{"text":"I guess customer service and their coffee could earn them 2/5 stars. Eggs were ordinary; bacon was maple yet not specified; home fries tasted like wood."}
{"text":"Have only attended once so I can't really give it a 5 yet.  But, it has potential to max out.  The staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing for a stressed out little smoking baby like me.  Had basic breakfast fare and have to say that the eggs, toast, sausages, peameal are all nicely done.  But, the thing that captured my attention was the home fries.  They simply were the best part of the meal.  I had them well done with an add-on of sauteed onions.  Wow!  
Lastly, the place was really clean which is always nice."}
{"text":"EGGcellent Diner opened their doors approximately six months ago in the space where Rougemount Grill used to be. My intention was to go to Rougemount Grill since it had quite good reviews on Yelp but I found this little gem instead.

I don't quite understand the layout of this restaurant though. You enter through one door only to presented with the option to then enter through one of two doors... which are beside each other but open into different areas of the restaurant. The restaurant is quite small rendering this 'extra' entrance a waste of time (and space) in my opinion.

There's also an odd partition separating one row of tables from the rest... I'm not sure what purpose it serves but it certainly stops the restaurant from having a nice flow. The restaurant looks somewhat 'unfinished' which is a shame because this space has such potential... but I digress. On to the food!

EGGcellent Diner's base menu consisting of your typical 'diner' fare with most items being under $10. They also offer lunch specials which can be found posted on their chalkboard when you walk in (through the second door on the right!).

My husband ordered the standard bacon and eggs while I thought I would be a little more daring and go for the eggs benedict! I get nervous ordering eggs benedict because nobody enjoys a poorly made Hollandaise sauce but it's one of my favourites so when I see it, I have to have it.

I ordered my eggs poached soft and I must say, they were PERFECTLY cooked!! The Hollandaise sauce was delicious and the home fries were seasoned beautifully. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this dish was cooked and would definitely order it again.

My husband ordered his eggs sunny-side up and again, they were cooked to perfection as was the bacon (which had a nice smokey flavour to it).

The service was quick and really friendly and overall, we had a really good experience. Now that I've found them, I will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"This lovely little joint went unnoticed until last weekend when we were looking for a nearby brunch joint.  We have been big fans of Angelique's in Ajax but we've seen Eggcellent Diner whenever we were in the plaza buying meat from Bruno's Signature and was intrigued enough to try it.  

I'm glad we finally got a chance to try out this place because it was perfect; location wise, portion wise and service wise.  The restaurant seats maybe 30-40 people so it's small but you don't feel crammed.  The waitress was friendly and promptly filled our order.  We ordered a pancake special (came with 2, 4 inch pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 strips of bacon and 2 eggs and home fries) and eggs benedict (3 eggs on English muffic halves with peameal bacon and home fries).  I have to say, their portion size was perfect as I find a lot of the breakfast/brunch joints give you wayyyyyyyyy too much food and I always feel guilty leaving half of my plate uneaten.  Seriously, who can finish those ridiculous mound of home fries at Angelique's?  

With tax and tip the bill was around  $30 and we left the restaurant two happy campers.  Sated but not stuffed like pigs.  :)"}
{"text":"So, Lee and I were meeting his brother and his wife out in Pickering for brunch. They told us to pick a place, so I went to consult Yelp for suggestions.

We didn't want a place too expensive, but a place that wasn't a total dive. This seemed to be a place that had good ratings, but a lot of the reviews in general out here were a bit out of date, including this place, the most recent being March of 2014.

Still and all they were mostly positive, so we decided to roll the dice.

It was an interesting layout. There are walls that seem like they should be for booths, but there were tables and chairs instead. I almost think the walls need to be torn out so there's more room and a more open feel. It felt a little cramped.

We were seated quickly and the service was attentive, and they didn't push us out and allowed us to linger over coffee, although they could have cleared the dishes out sooner. Lee and I both had Eggs Benedict, and this is where the biggest gripes were. Our eggs were almost hard, super firm for poached eggs, so that made me a little sad. My favorite part of a benny is having runny egg yolk oozing all over and into the home fries and everything else. Lee actually found a couple of pieces of shell in his, which I think is something I would have sent it back for (I suppose I should have sent mine back too) but he said it was good enough otherwise. I actually liked the Hollandaise sauce, although it was a little on the thick side. Lee wasn't super impressed. Lee's brother had a pancake and eggs breakfast and he was very happy with it. His sister in law had a peameal sandwich which she liked.

Oh that is one thing, the peameal was excellent, with a good flavor. 

So, in conclusion, I'm pretty forgiving about most things, and when I asked Lee, he said he'd give it three stars, so three it is. I'd probably give it more of a 2 1/2 but I'll be kind and round it up. I'd go back, but I'd make sure they poach the eggs on the soft side."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning at EGGcellent Diner.  It's in a small plaza on Kingston Road. 

I ordered an \"Old Fashion Breakfast\" with peameal bacon and three eggs.  It was a big hearty breakfast and was good.

The server was really friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing for brunch. Simple and delicious. Quiet and quaint. Really wish I lived around here so I could visit often. I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the side of potatoes were really flavorful."}
{"text":"We attended a wedding in Pickering and wanted to go out for breakfast the next day.  Eggcellent Diner was close to the hotel.  

I ordered Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and my friend got the big breakfast.  

Service was very good, coffee was fresh and food was delicious.  totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"I found EGGcellent Diner to be painfully average. The service was very straight forward, with no flair whatsoever. 

My friend had a strawberry milkshake which he said was pretty good. I had a coffee and the three eggs benedict. The coffee was somewhat resentful, but drinkable. 

The three eggs Benedict did have three eggs, but only two english muffins and two pieces of peameal bacon. Kind of seems like false advertising. The side of hash browns left much to be desired. They were pretty flavourless and slightly undercooked. The hollandaise sauce was also just very plain.

So like I said, an overall average experience. That being said, the prices reflect this averageness, and are noticeably cheaper than many places.

If you're looking for a quick breakfast for a fair price, then come on in. If you're looking for a breakfast experience that cannot be matched in your kitchen at home, then carry on."}
{"text":"Great location for an informal brunch. Fantastic friendly and quick service that you would expect in a fine restaurant. The food was delicious, hot and ready quickly.   Would return for sure!"}
