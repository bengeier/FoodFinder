{"text":"Had a dinner party here in one of their private dining rooms.  The food, drinks, and service were all outstanding.   Started with the calamari, Antipasto (w/cured meats, artisan cheese, marinated olives, Marcona almonds, quince paste and flat bread), Crispy Calamari with aioli and  Lamb Merguez Sausage; followed by the Caprese; mozzarella, tomato and basil; and for the main course I had the Flat Iron steak, fingerling potatoes, shishito peppers, piperade sauce (cooked perfectly).  I finished off my meal with the Julia Baker Chocolate Mousse Cake.  I have to say everything was 5 star: food was fabulous, service was excellent, I'll  certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"My group had a dessert and cocktails in the Prado/Mbar lounge and it was fantastic. Pastry Chef Ben & Chef Michael did an amazing job on the desserts for our party. Not only were they the prettiest things you ever did see, but they tasted out of this world! Everyone was taking pictures of the heart chocolate box with truffles inside and the saguaro cactus scene made of white chocolate.  The variety of fruits, chocolates and cakes satisfied everyone's taste buds. Thank you also to the amazing service from Taylor, Allison, Amal, Victor, Bronco filling our drinks and putting smiles on our faces with their impeccable service. My out of town guests can't wait to come back and stay at the resort this time. Finally, thank you to Kelli, Joey & Frank for putting it all together with such ease and professionalism that I didn't have to worry about one detail! You guy's Rock!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix area. If you love different kinds of food you will find this the best restaurant in the  valley. From happy hour snacks to tapas to a dining menu extraordinaire. The newly arrived Chef Small has a Lamb Tajine to die for.  It would be a sad day if you missed this one"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Omni and had both dinner and breakfast at Prado.  Both meals were delicious and the service was amazing. Our server for breakfast was Carmen, and she was outstanding. Her great sense of humor added to starting our day off correctly. The roasted cauliflower tapas at dinner was astounding."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Perfect customer service. My husband had the seafood paella, which was packed with delish seafood and the broth was exquisite.  I had the branzino which was amazing, the fennel, brussel spouts and citrus paired with the moist flaky fish was wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow! Our food was amazing. I ordered the filet it was like butter. My sister ordered the paella. Her dish was very authentic. The red lentil soup was also amazing. Loren is the best waiter! Ask for him!:)"}
{"text":"Went to Prado for a birthday celebration and things started off very well - it's a beautiful dining room, and the live guitar music is a nice addition. The hostess and maitre d' were both friendly and personable. They pour you a glass of sherry on the way to sit down at the table, a lovely touch of authentic Spain. All good so far. However, the food is very hit or miss, as others have suggested. Some dishes really shined (butternut squash soup, bison short rib, pineapple coconut cake) while others really disappointed (one-dimensional gazpacho, chewy calamari, fish overpowered by olive tapenade). My advice: soak in the atmosphere and music at the bar, maybe snack on some tapas, but skip the restaurant unless you're okay with hit-and-miss. Such a shame, too, because I LOVED Chef Urciuoli's cuisine when he was at Taggia."}
{"text":"I only gave this 5 stars because that was the limit. My wife and I just had a one-to-one meal with the Head Chef, Claudia. His passion for food is incredible, the man is a genius. The experience was $65 per head. I defy anywhere in Scottsdale to match this for value for money!"}
{"text":"Brendan in the bar is an amazing bartender! He is so knowledgeable and can make some outstanding cocktails!! He remembered us by name and gave us the best service we had for our entire trip! People like Brendan are the reason we go back to the montelucia Omni! Truly exceptional."}
{"text":"Probably my worst dining experience EVER!  Went on Saturday evening, had a lovely time drinking overpriced cocktails outside while enjoying the gorgeous setting.  That is where any mention of a pleasurable experience ends.  Once seated the service was dismal at best.  Server took 15 mins to bring one glass of champagne even though we saw it sitting in the bar ready to be picked up for over 12 mins (the other members of my party were never even offered a refreshed cocktail the entirety of our stay).  Took another 15 mins for us to track down a different waiter so he could go find OUR waiter so we could order.  Appetizers came fairly quickly and were just ok, very disproportionate servings and not at all worth the prices.  After our apps came, another 30 mins passed before we finally flagged down the manager to find out 1) where our waiter was, and 2) where the rest of our meal was.  10 mins later the manager came back to tell us that the delay was due to our chicken.  2 people in my party ordered the chicken - didn't realize they had to kill the chicken and prep it before cooking because I have never had to wait over 45 mins for chicken (15 mins while we ate our apps and another 30 mins eating our 2nd basket of bread).  Our waiter finally showed up acting completely aloof wondering why we were upset and then quickly disappeared again.  Another 20 mins and still NO FOOD.  We had had enough.  We flagged down the manager to advise we'd be leaving.  He tried to get us to stay and offered to pay for our meals.  At that point he could have offered us meals for the next month for free and we would not have bitten.  This was beyond horrible and honestly the one star I gave it was very generous.  There is nothing anyone could do to ever make me return to this establishment with the staff they have working there.  For what was supposed to be high end resort dining, this was anything but.  I've gotten much better service at Chili's Bar and Grill, and that is just pathetic.  The management and owners of Prado should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"This restuarant is inside  the beautiful InterContinental Montelucia Resort & Spa. Driving up towards the hotel and restaurant has breathtaking views and once inside the awesome ambience and decor continues.  Food is good though not the best I have ever eaten. Me and a  group of friends went there for dinner. A friend and I had the lamb sausage pasta which was quite nice. Another friend had the potato gnocchi which he liked. The server was patient and reasonably attentive.  For desert we had the lava cake and a raspberry pistachio tart which was ok. Also,the bread that comes with the food wasnt the best.  The restaurant scores because of the amazing ambience , live music, great atmosphere and crowd and the overall good experience me and my friends had.  Tip: Valet parking is complimentary if you are dining at this restaurant."}
{"text":"With dishes ranging from unpleasant to mediocre to excellent, this was a difficult score to determine.  Ultimately I decided on 2 stars because of the price - for Prado's prices I expect consistent excellence.  The salad I ordered for lunch was accompanied by some lovely manchego cheese, however the greens were soused in what tasted like pure balsamic vinegar - too much of an acid trip for either me or my husband.  A couple other small plates for lunch were edible but forgettable.  The paella was a bland disappointment. The soft shell crab appetizer was fantastic, as was the whole roasted oratta (sp?), a Mediterranean fish.    The service was completely lacking - once our dinner was served we were completely left to our own devices - pouring our own wine, no water refills, etc.  At lunch we were left waiting with our menus for  about 15 minutes before our orders were taken - it a nearly empty place.  Maybe I'll pop in again for whole fish, but there are too many better places to drop a couple hundred for dinner."}
{"text":"we visited Prado  3 times this week and we were pleased with everything that we had speacially the service was nice our server took his time to explain the food to us before we order so it was clear to us you know this restaurant they dont write everything in the menu you need a server help to order and their manager was cheking every table and greeding them which is nice  . My husband and I loved  the portions and the value is what you can get every where else i guess and also you are eating at resot so it is resonable..... I had half chiken and it was the most juicy chiken i have ever eaten and the flavors where just right. my husband had lamb pasta which is something  commen but it was really good and tasty .. and the dessert ohh my god it was so good . I had This Warm curros with Hot dark Chocolate sauce on side which you dip in it was marvelous...... and i might go tonight and have one more time before i leave  this great  resort and restaurant ....."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. We made reservations for our party of six by phone in advance.    Beautiful restaurant, killer view. The brunch was buffet-style, cold plates of cut fruit, cheeses, antipasti, salame, etc. Hot foods in covered chafing dishes: bacon, sausages, potatoes, quesadillas/breakfast tacos, pancakes, waffles, etc. Omelet bar with name-your-own omelets. Bagels/lox/cream cheese. Very tasty food, and there will be something for everyone.  Everything VERY fresh, constantly restocked, and high quality.  Coffee cups sometimes not refilled, waters not refilled, OJ only offered at beginning of meal and then not refilled. Waitress was not busy, so this is why we only give four stars. If she had more \"hustle\" we would have awarded five stars due to the surroundings, the food quality and variety, and the friendliness of the manager who stopped by our table three times during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed.  Classy operation; we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Consistently bad! I've stayed at this property a few times and dined at Prado every time.  You would think I'd learn. Food is terrible at best, service is nonexistent over 3 hrs for dinner, and crazy overpriced. Anyone who uses Yelp and still goes here gets what they deserve.  Went for breakfast next day. The chef came over and spoke to us regarding our experience.  He's trying to clean up the brand, has a lot of work...  Will not go back."}
{"text":"What an experience. Hospitality was on point from beginning to end. Went to the bar after dinner and had a blast. Our bartender Kyle was gracious and accommodating, and we had so much fun chatting with him. What a great guy. All the food was great but the Caesar salad was a stand out and the vanilla gelato was so damn good. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night to celebrate a special occasion. We decided to go with the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings and we were not disappointed! The chef came to our table and asked us our likes and dislikes (yes to everything!!) and before we knew it our first course and flute of champagne were at the table. The food and wine pairings were delicious, and the impeccable service by our waiter, Oliverio, as well as the Chef coming out and presenting each plate made for a very memorable evening.    As many reviewers have already stated, the resort is a destination on its own. The architecture, lighting, and attention-to-detail gives a romantic vibe, and the outstanding service and food will definitely bring us back again."}
{"text":"I liked sitting outside on the patio.  The view of Camelback mountain is hard to beat.  I was not excited by the drink list.  I tend to judge restaurants immediately by their drink lists.  For a hotel, it was boring and hotels in AZ should know better.  The menu for the the restaurant looked good.  There were quite a few things that I would have ordered.  Since this was a complimentary dinner, I decided to go with the steak, although the seafood ravioli looked good.  We also started with the burrata cheese and tomatoes, which was probably the best course.  I had the rib-eye which was good, but I had asked to change out the potatoes, and they didn't ....Oh well.  Overall, the place is good, service is good, and atmosphere is very nice.  I think that a better drink list, and a few more seafood items on the menu might be an improvement."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is in a very serene resort with great service and outstanding decor. My dinner couldn't  match the hype. My server was very difficult to understand though he kept saying he was there to help me. After some deliberation, I chose the Burata and Tagliatelle. I wanted more Burata than tomatoes. It was overwhelming amounts. Same for the pasta. I think the ratio was 3 to 1 sauce to pasta. I sent most of the tomatoes and the sauce for the pasta back with no concern from my server. He was quick to drop the dessert menu, though. I was very disappointed. I would not attempt to return with those prices."}
{"text":"We had really high hopes for this very attractive restaurant, as it was the last evening of our vacation and we were looking forward to enjoying a truly splendid experience.  However, the intro to the restaurant at breakfast put me on the defensive.   Also, in view of the high prices, I truly expected more.  At breakfast, the buffet was nice; good oatmeal, lots of nice toast, and a tasty omelette; but sadly, in my experience, truly terrible lackluster service!   We had to almost beg for plates to be cleared, and to get more coffee.  Also, our breakfast dining experience was truly spoiled by some neanderthal at a nearby table, directly in our line of site, whose mother never taught him how to eat properly (he literally shoveled food into his mouth sideways).  So offputting!  Not the restaurant's fault, but made the experience less enjoyable overall.  The restaurant would benefit from more busboys so that the waiters can do their jobs more efficiently.  We observed some poor guy who had to get up from his table to help himself to more coffee (AND our waitress had to go to kitchen to get Milk for our Coffee!!!).  Minimal liquor in expensive cocktails and mixed drinks (at Mbar and honestly also at the Centro Lounge near the pool) was such a disappointment as well.  Also re: service, our 1st waiter went missing so a 2nd had to step in to assist, on two occasions!  I also felt the waiters were somewhat \"oleaginous\".  I also was served the WORST cappuccino I've ever had in a hi priced restaurant -- ever; it was awful and not worth the price (unlike at the CRAVE CAFE, where a latte, while expensive, was actually good).  The scallops entrée I had was tasty, but, sadly, I was half-way thru it before the waiter offered me a 2d glass of wine.  So disappointed.    Prices are high: $18+ for continental breakfast!  $30+ for dinner entrée.  For the flying insect problem inside at breakfast, consistent disappointments regarding service & those high prices, so sorry, never again."}
{"text":"Excellent resort and spa. Friendly staff and excellent service. At the Prado restaurant, you can enjoy the amazing food, beautiful view and fantastic music."}
{"text":"A case study in great service. No more than 10 minutes after sharing our unfortunate and clearly uncommon experience, we received a call from the head of food and beverage extending their sincerest apologies.  Everyone can make a mistake from time to time, but the great places make things right. In our case they made things right and then some. We've never been taken care of so well as we were by the staff and management of Prado.  Thank you for an even more memorable evening than we were expecting!"}
{"text":"Would have to agree with the waiter who said to go to El Charro instead! The highly recommended calamari was terrible. We sent it back twice. The beet salad was excellent. The highly recommended fillet was smothered in gravy and the potatoes took over the plate along with soggy brussel sprouts.. The waitress was very nice. Drinks were good but very expensive. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary last Saturday night. The resort courtyard and pool area provide beautiful views of Camelback mountain from the north. A fantastic setting to chill, relax, and just be together. All service staff were friendly and courteous. They made us feel special and took good care of us. We started outside by the pool with a couple cold beverages before our reservation. Ee highly recommend the kale salad, cauliflower app, gluten free bread, and fish. My paella was perfect! And we couldn't resist splurging for dessert of modern banana split and bread pudding. You wont be disappointed. We will be back to Prado."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not a fan of hotel restaurants, but this place is a GEM!!  Fresh ingredients, great flavor combos, ambience is cozy and yet upbeat, and the service was amazing.  Go early, have a drink outside by the fire, and watch the sunset on Camelback Mountain.  Once inside, ask to sit in Nathan's section, he's awesome! He's so attentive without hovering, great suggestions, even brought me a sample of his favorite salad so I could try it! (Which I then ordered!) Order the kale salad...to die for and I don't even like kale! And the lamb chop app...wow!  Have yet to check out dessert menu, service was so good, I'm writing this while finishing the lamb chops!"}
{"text":"We went to prado for diner last night! For appetizer we had the beat salad and the burrata. For dinner the lamb t-bone and the sonoma chicken. Dessert the churros. Everything was delicious, very simple and rustic from the atomsphere to the dishes itself. Would definately return."}
{"text":"We went here for a holiday weekend while staying at the hotel. Thinking the food would have to be good for the extremely high price we went in with high expectations. The food was VERY mediocre at best. The scallops were cooked well, but over seasoned and the risotto they came with was gross. The salmon was overcooked and came with a vegetable side that ever more disgusting than the risotto which we could not finish. Needless to say we will not be going back..."}
{"text":"went here for birthday dinner with the boyfriend...BEAUTIFUL atmosphere, I didn't want to leave!!  Our server was great; I hate when servers are just trying to sell the most expensive thing on the menu but she gave some great suggestions and was totally honest about whether or not she had actually tried the different dishes.  The menu is a very modern take on Italian food and changes each week based on what's most fresh from local farms and grower's which I LOVED.  We ordered a bottle of wine-hess chardonnay and it was perfectly chilled-and then snacked on the bread which was so good I could have just eaten that.  The portions are perfect to share, so we started with the tonno-tuna appetizer, really good start to the meal.  Next we shared their maiz pasta with peppers and beans, good but it just seamed to be lacking something-we thought a cheese would have been nice but no one came by to see how it was or offer anything else and we didn't want it to get cold.  finally we shared the pork chops which were good, I wasn't the biggest fan of the veggies and potatoes that accompanied it though.  For my birthday they let me pick any dessert on the menu, but were out of the one I wanted :( but every dessert was chocolate, chocolate or more chocolate; we ended up picking the only non-chocolate dish which was hazelnut gelato and this apple pastry thing-it was okay not great again it was just missing that little something.  I think I would have given more stars had I been completely wow'd by our meal but I just wasn't.  You can tell that it's all very fresh ingredients but I just felt like they were seasoned weird and when I go to a place like this and are spending the money like we did I really wanted to wow my taste buds.  It was a good night, great ambiance and I did like our server I just wish the food made me want to go back."}
{"text":"So disappointed - this use to be my favorite place to lunch in the Valley.  Went today and the food was mediocre, the server was curt and inattentive - not the standard I expect for the price.  Think it is time to move on...."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the level of service and cuisine for the breakfast and dinner at Prado.   Usually when my husband and I stay at a resort the food doesn't match the quality of the hotel but Prado was a huge win for us. Everything we have ordered from them has been wonderful. And the service has been exceptional as well."}
{"text":"Smail, the Executive Chef, put together one of the best meals we have ever had. His emphasis is on fresh ingredients and simplicity with a little Mediterranean flare. Everything we had was cooked to absolute perfection and the sea bass especially was literally out of this world. I have never had fish so soft, juicy(typically I don't use this term to describe fish) and had the perfect crust on the top. I highly recommend this dish, it's unreal. Kudos to the entire team as well. The wait staff was fantastic and the managers/chef stopped by a few times just to chat and make sure we had everything we needed. I have eaten at many famous restaurants and have to say that this night stands out as one of the best, thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Happy hour at bar was reasonable and sangria was good. But more important, the customer service was AWESOME. Grandpa Frank is the real deal and treats you like family. Kyle is a great bartender and extremely friendly. Derrick was also great for our Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"We recently had the Prado restaurant at the Montelucia cater a 20-person party for my wife birthday. We left the menu completely up to Chef Smail and he created a truly memorable meal. We started out with a wide variety of mezze appetizers (olives, eggplant, roasted peppers, etc.). The first course was chicken kabobs- very tender, great flavor- followed by a main course of slow-cooked lamb shank which was extraordinary. The Chef made us a beautiful custom birthday cake for dessert. Service was great and the restaurant vibe was upbeat and fun with a great 3-piece jazz band playing in the lounge. All said, we couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable evening. We'll be back soon..and often. Our compliments to the chef and his team!!"}
{"text":"This was very disappointing! What a scam. Nothing was very good. Don't know where to start. NY strip was OK - not real flavorfull. Arugala salad was bland. Even appetizers were worse than good bar food.  This is not quality high end food. Save you money and find Capital Grill.  If you're going to pay the price you deserve top quality."}
{"text":"We came for dinner and sat in the bar due the restaurant being \"fully committed\" for dinner reservations. Mind you there were literally 3 tables with people when we arrived AND when we left after our meal.   The food was subpar to say the least (I can only speak to the dinner menu). The salmon was awfully fishy and my husband's dish was just \"meh\". For the price you pay for a meal here, there are plenty of other great restaurants nearby with far superior food.   The service however was great."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. For dinner, I had the chicken. Simply exquisite. Paired with a glass of Pinot Noir, asparagus, and a harissa mash. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it had to be the best creme brûlée I've ever had. So yummy. Went back for breakfast and enjoyed their buffet, so delicious. The service here is simply impeccable, just so friendly, and attentive. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Just want to say hats off to the chef for an impeccable meal! The entire course was absolutely amazing.  They start you off with this very warm sour dough bread with this herby garlic spread. So good.  I then ordered the best salad with this Spanish bleu cheese. Light and pleasant.  I then ordered the scallops and my god they were probably the best scallops I've ever had. It came with this lobster infused (and chunks of lobster) Israeli couscous that just went with it so well. It was savory and balanced.    The next night we went again and I had the fried risotto balls with chorizo in them. Done deal. Their chorizo had this very smoky but not overwhelming taste. I could've eaten 10.  Their special was this fish flown in from Hawaii the day before. Seared and had a truffle risotto with it. And the truffle was just the right amount. Not overwhelming at all.  I plan to tell anyone I know visiting Scottsdale to come check this place out.  Bravo  P.S the service is perfection."}
{"text":"Weekend Breakfast Buffet....the Montelucia is an absolutely beautiful resort that is always a pleasure be it dining, spa, gym or staycation.  On the weekends you can certainly order off a fairly standard breakfast menu or choose the breakfast buffet.  I've had the buffet on several occasions and my review is pretty consistent in each visit.  Service is assertive if not overly attentive (they don't stalk you but your coffee/water is usually filled promptly) the build your own omelette station is very good with an attentive chef my only complaint with the omelettes is if you order mushrooms in your omelette you will get entire small mushrooms nicely sautéed.  I appreciate the freshness and presentation but I liked my mushrooms chopped in my eggs instead of eating stem and cap over and over.  I am sure they would chop it for you but I don't want to be a pain.  They always have beautiful fresh fruit, salmon, cool meats, oatmeal/granola exc....the hot items are standard bacon (thick cut but not crispy by any stretch of the imagination ) sausage, sometimes it is turkey sausage which I prefer, hash browns (if you like them crisp and well cooked you will be disappointed)  then usually a starch mini pancakes or French toast depending on the day.  The last rounded silver serving tray has what my friends and I call \"the mystery box\" I suppose it is whatever the chef felt like creating that day it could be breakfast quesadillas, breakfast tacos (terrible) or mini breakfast sandwiches.  It's an ongoing joke with my dining companions to avoid the mystery box everything else is fair game ! (Just never had anything good out of it after all my visits) then of course save room for a conservative assortment of deserts (different every visit) can include anything from creme brûlée to bread pudding."}
{"text":"My third visit b/c I love the views of Camelback at sunset.  I love the zucchini florets and the pasta tastes homemade.  I would have probably given four stars, but the service was blase'.  The prices are a bit on the high side.  We opted for Chelsea's Kitchen for dessert b/c it has been disappointing in the past but it looks like their adding desserts from Julia Baker.  WIll have to try next visit."}
{"text":"This review has to do with dinner last Friday, June 27th, as part of their \"Night of Romance\" package, which included a $100 food and beverage credit to any of the establishments on the Montelucia grounds.  I had been looking forward to eating at Prado for some time, as my wife an I were married on the property in October 2010 when it was owned by InterContinental Hotels, but alas, did not have time to try the restaurant itself. My wife and I made reservations for 8pm. Upon arrival you could see some of the price is for the beautiful surroundings. There is an amazing view of Camelback Mountain from the patio, while the surrounding Alhambra inspired décor was very relaxing and welcoming. You could see that dining al fresco in October or the spring would be amazing here. They had live jazz playing in the lounge which is always cool. We were seated promptly at a nice table by the window to enjoy the view by the courteous hosting staff, which also made the thoughtful gesture of offering my wife a white napkin for her white dress. The busboy was very proper and offered us our choice of water (which we chose sparkling). Then, unfortunately, things slowly began to unravel...  Our server, who was perfectly nice, seemed completely overwhelmed. During his initial introduction, he struggled to remember the specials and forgot to take our drink order. We believed he would be right back, but it was nearly 10 minutes later that the manager came over to take our order. This, by the way, in a restaurant that was maybe half full. During this time we received some fresh bread and olive oil, which was decent but not amazing (It's bread and olive oil, after all). My wife's dirty martini was well made, and our server returned shortly after to take our order.  We ordered the salmon carpaccio ($16), half chicken with Brussels sprouts and potatoes ($32, wow), and diver scallops with saffron risotto ($37). The carpaccio was delicious, lightly smoked with watercress, capers, and a flavorful but not overwhelming horseradish sauce. While the portion was by no means huge, it was a pretty good amount of salmon (I was expecting much less). My wife's half chicken came with lemon-chili Brussels sprouts and roasted Yukon gold potatoes. While her dish was good (but let's be honest, chicken is chicken), it was definitely not worth the $32 price tag. For $32, the chicken better be transcendent; this was not. My scallops, while perfectly cooked and delicious, were also very small in quantity and size. I had read that portions were small for the price, but this was a little ridiculous. Three small to medium sized scallops over about a half handful of bland saffron risotto. The risotto tasted more like a drab version of paella rice rather than the saffron infused Arborio variety that was advertised. For $37, either three jumbos or at least twice as many scallops are necessary to make this dish acceptable, as well as an overhaul of the less than inspiring risotto that accompanies them. After our drinks were comped (I'm assuming the sparkling water was comped as well), total damage was $90 or so before tip.  I don't mind sitting down to dinner for a long time (in fact, I relish it if at all possible), but this meal just seamed like it wasn't paced very well. We sat for almost 2 hours with no offer for additional cocktails. There was a long lull between everything, including our appetizer and entrees. Again, our server was nice, but he just seemed like he couldn't keep up with his other tables either. I'm a former industry man, I get it, but at the same time when you come to a place like this you expect it to meet certain, well, expectations, especially when it comes to service. You don't go to French Laundry and expect Chili's service (which I shouldn't bag on Chili's because I have had unbelievable service there before, but you get my point). With the still small but ever improving culinary scene starting to blossom here in Phoenix, I would advise that Prado is simply not worth the price at this time. After living in Los Angeles for a good period of time, you begin to appreciate not only quality but value for that quality. At Prado, unfortunately, it just isn't there yet. Normally I would give Prado 3 stars, because the food wasn't terrible, but I am judging Prado a bit harsher than I would a Red Lobster or something for obvious reasons...you should get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Atmosphere is wonderful. Service was impeccable. The bread and dipping pesto sauce they give you is so good! We got the chicken gnocchi and the fish special. Both were okay. They gave us a free happy anniversary dessert which was so lovely."}
{"text":"The server was kinda silly but overall he was kind. The busboy was on top of it and they remembered it was our anniversary so that was very special. I'm sad to say that our food was mediocre. I ordered the gnocchi and my husband orders the salmon. The gnocchi was really mushy and oily. The salmon was bland. The cauliflower app was really yummy. I won't be coming back. Our bill was over $100 and I just didn't feel it was worth it."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday night. Our reservations were at 8. The service and the food was excellent. At 9 a band started that played a bunch of good songs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Frank was an absolute joy and was very accomodating. Our waiter was fantastic and had a great attitude and our food and cocktails were great. They definitely made the celebration special! Loved the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. The service was so bad I won't come back. Pricey for what you get.   Very disappointed   Will not come back  Had to wait 25 minuets to get our bill"}
{"text":"We went to Sunday Brunch. At first I was impressed. Nicer hotel and all....right? Nice grounds, friendly people and what you would expect from an upscale hotel. The brunch was OK but nothing special. No seafood (that's what I wanted too) and very little to choose from. The only thing I saw a lot of was \"flies\". Even though it was over 100 degrees outside they had the doors open. Why I do not know. Flies were everywhere. It was a not so nice eating experience. I do want to give credit to the waitress. She was super nice. I just wish we had less flies, and maybe close the doors.So much for brunch..... I guess."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and service. Menu had enough variety to be interesting. Cesar salad was delicious with \"real\" fresh lettuce and anchovies. Enjoyed the Filet. Dessert was both pretty and tasty. On the pricy side."}
{"text":"It was my birthday weekend, and my hubby wanted to splurge on a fancy dinner! It was a beautiful setting with live music. We had reservations so were seated quickly. Our server was great, and she went over specials with us. I ordered a pasta dish with lobster it was so good! My husband of course ordered a steak. He said it was cooked perfectly. Dessert was on them since it was my birthday I ordered a bread pudding, and it was so good. I wish I could've ate it all, but I was stuffed!   We had breakfast at the restaurant twice since we were staying at the beautiful resort, and the breakfast selection if you do the buffett is pretty amazing if you're into breakfast.   They offer omelettes that they will cook up for you with so many choices of veggies, and meats. They also have a station with seasonal fresh fruits, another one with pastries, bagels, breakfast desserts they seriously go all out. If you're looking for a smaller less filling breakfast you can order directly off their menu.   One more thing is I loved the outdoor seating it's beautiful out on the patio with a fountain, and the amazing Camelback views! The service was great everyone is so attentive!"}
{"text":"I organized a bachelorette staycation weekend at the Montelucia  3/10-3/11, and in staying true to myself I waited until the last two weeks to really get ideas that were floating around in my head for months actually solidified. I wish I could remember the names of everyone I dealt with, because Prado and Omni really made it less stressful.  I first made a telephone reservation for our party of 12, but had left a message on the phone number listed on the website for private dining. I was called back the next day (by Sarah) and was pleased to hear that the room I had my eye on, Ferdinand's cellar, was available. I was immediately presented options I wasn't ready for: Do I have any decorations I want to bring in? Do I have a special menu in mind?  If I had time I totally would have taken advantage of this, because it sounds like they were really open to it.  Dinner was a surprise to the bachelorette, but we popped by for wine/cigars/martinis the night before next to a courtyard fireplace (fantastic ambiance, especially for a mild Arizona spring night) and for breakfast that day. Service and bloody marys were great and so was Grandpa Frank! Grandpa Frank deserves a yelp page of his own.  Dinner. Holy cow. We checked in and once our whole party arrived our hostess led us to Ferdinand's Cellar. A long table fit 14 of us (they had easily accommodated a party # change for a limited seating room) and a very thoughtful hand written message to the bride from the staff was waiting for her at her seat. The room ambiance was great with candles and low lighting. We were well attended to, recommendations were on point and the food was fantastic. The only negative thing worth noting happened with the accuracy of splitting bills, but some of the fault may lie with our party there.  Too Long; Didn't Read: Reservations were a BREEZE, Ambiance is FANTASTIC, Service was GREAT, this place definitely worth dressing up for and having a special occasion dinner at. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch, cool inside homey restaurant. Nice bar.  Great staff under pressure.  simple but delicious burger and fries with tasty heirloom tomato salad."}
{"text":"Location and view play a predominant role in my experiences.  This location is nestled in the mountains of Scottsdale and the view from the outdoor patio is breathtaking.  Five stars for that.  The food is prepared and beautifully presented.  All dishes contained delicious tasting sauces and all used high quality ingredients.  Everything that touched our palate received either a nod, a smile or a swoon.  The chef and his staff are well trained in pleasing the eye, the mouth and the olfactory senses. Five stars for the food and presentation.  Service was amazing.  It was not crowded and I felt like I was a Princess being waited on along with my Prince.  The total package was a five star experience.  Can't wait to return.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...  We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.  They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service."}
{"text":"Prado was the most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in a while. No stranger to AZ Restaurant week, I've had my eye on Prado for a while. The fella and I did a mini staycation at the Montelucia, so we figured it was the perfect time to check it out.   Our reservations were at 8:30. We arrived a bit early to see if they had a table ready, but they didn't (not a big deal) so we hung out at the bar for a drink. Well, we didn't get sat at our table until 8:50, TWENTY minutes after our reservation. What even is the point of a reservation in that case? We saw plenty of people walk in after us and be seated almost immediately, and there were a bunch of empty tables that remained empty throughout the whole meal. And, we didn't even get any sort of apology or \"thank you for your patience.\" It was a frustrating situation and it was never acknowledged by the maître d' that anything was out of the ordinary. We were annoyed but thought, \"well we have a seat now so it's not a big deal, and we'll just move forward and enjoy our meal.\" No dice.   As I mentioned, this was during Arizona Restaurant Week, which honestly is a pretty big deal amongst valley upscale restaurants. We weren't even give restaurant week menus, we had to specifically ask for them. Again, no apology. Just \"Oh, would you like to see that menu?\" Yes, of course we would.   Then, we were not visited by our server for another full 20 minutes after being seated. We were at least brought waters by the busboy (?) who seemed to be the one staff member on top of his duties. We were able to put in our orders with no issue, and the server was able to answer the fella's questions about which dishes contained gluten. Our food came out in a decent timeframe after that.   My first course was the baked triple creme brie, which was a very unique take. I've had a lot of brie in my life, was practically raised on it, but I've never seen it presented in this way. It came melted in a hollowed out little brick of bread, with honey smeared on the side of the board and inexplicably, also under the bread as if they were trying to glue down the bread. The brie was, of course, excellent, and melted in a way where it didn't get weird and hard as I was trying to eat it (you brie fans know exactly what I'm talking about). The marcona almonds were a nice touch, but I wish they had been full almonds rather than crushed. The honey was excellent, with just a touch of lemony tang. However, the bread was a weird choice. It had almost the texture of Irish soda bread, which I don't dislike, but was like a weird textural pairing for brie. The dude had the kale salad, which he said was fine but he wished all of the good parts were not crushed/chopped (marcona almonds, broccoli, etc.).   For my main course, I opted for the short rib with gnocchi. It was absolutely stellar. Rioja braised, the meat fell right off the bone and I didn't even need a knife to eat it, that's how tender it was. It was one of the best short ribs I've ever had in my life. The gnocchi had a great taste to it, but was just a touch salty for my liking. My dish came with 2 halves of Brussels Sprouts, which were roasted perfectly and super tasty--wish there had been a few more. The guy had the paella valenciana and it blew him away. We're both huge paella fans, and are always searching for the next great paella. He said all of the seafood was cooked perfectly, and they used authentic pans which created the layer of crispy paella rice on the bottom. Far and away, the main course was the best part of the meal, and is the only reason Prado doesn't get the minimum possible amount of stars in my book.   We had finished our main courses for quite a while before being visited again by the aforementioned busboy, who very quickly packaged up our leftovers and made sure we were doing well. No idea where our server was. A different food runner brought our desserts. We both had the crema catalana, which as far as I could tell was just creme brûlée, one of my all time favorite desserts. It was perfectly good, certainly edible, just nothing outstanding or spectacular. Your run of the mill creme brûlée.   I really was very let down by the service at Prado. At an upscale restaurant, I fully expect friendly waitstaff across the board that regularly check in to make sure the meal is going well, and are very on top of their jobs all around. The restaurant was not crazy busy, with plenty of empty tables. Plus, it was a Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend and during AZ Restaurant Week--it seems really silly that they wouldn't have planned ahead for that. All in all, likely will not be returning here even though the short rib blew my mind. At the price point, you're not just paying for the food; you are paying for the service, ambience, and all around environment. Prado was simply lacking."}
{"text":"Yes, I know, I can't believe I would rate any restaurant a 5 star.  The only other restaurant I have ever rated a 5 star would be Razz in Scottsdale.  We stay at this resort every time we go to Arizona and we tried the restaurant about a year ago.  Wasn't impressed now BUT very impressed now.  We took a cooking class from the new Chef, Peter in May and loved it, therefore we gave the restaurant another try.  Our waiter Arne was a certified sommelier and selected a fabulous Spanish wine for us.  He was extremely knowledgeable on wines, which we loved.  He also appreiciated us being huge foodies.  He also had several recommendations on the food, which all turned out to be over the top.  Appetizer:  Truffle infused beef tartare w/quail egg,  mustard aioli and parmesean cheese cracker - OMG....  First Course:  Homemade tagliatelle with pork sausage ragu, roasted cherry tomatoes, some other veggies in a very light cheese/butter sauce - so delicious!  Second Course:  Lamb chops with a cucumber yogurt puree, lentils with a complex, deep veal reduction sauce and a side of spinach w/chunks of pancetta and squash/zucchini with minted breadcrumbs.  Dessert:  We ordered tiramisu, which was the lightest I have ever had.  he also brought basil flavored gelatto.  I wouldn't have ever ordered it on a menu because it doesn't sound appealing - what a great surprise!  The dessert wine he recommended from Canada was fabulous.  I tasted the fruit rather than the sugar.     The service was impreccable, the food fabulous and sitting on the patio of this beautiful resort (even in the Arizona summer) was awesome!  Given their yelp rating I wouldn't have tried them; however, their yelp ratings will definitely improve over time as they have completely changed."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out Prado for a while now... opted to take a dates suggestion and go last night. The server was not entirely helpful on the wine list and was almost annoyed that my date was interested in knowing what the beer selection was. My salmon was quite good, the veggies served with it were quite good and complimentary to my entire meal. The overall experience was okay, the food... good, but for the price - not very impressive. We opted for the sundae dessert, which was fun, but nothing that was something I would have again. I have to admit, the best part was walking around the resort after and enjoying an abnormally cooler July evening."}
{"text":"We literally come every Sunday for brunch and to say we are obsessed is an understatement! The Best brunch in the valley and the BEST staff! Right when we pull in the valet man is just the sweetest and when we go into the restaurant we are typically greeted by Grandpa Frank and he embodies everything Prado is about... Outstanding customer service. In the years we have been coming here we have had every waiter and they are all amazing, but we particularly love Carmen and usually ask to be seated in her section. We always enjoy our delicious brunch while looking at the most beautiful view in Arizona!"}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant about trying Prado out because of some of the reviews. I got the impression that I may in for a hit-or-miss experience. And it was my fear that I'd catch one of their \"miss\" days. I was pleasantly surprised when I had an absolutely sublime meal!   Since the menu changes nightly, I won't bore you with details of the meal. I'm a huge fan of restaurants using local, organic produce &/or meats....and I'm a bigger fan of Prado b/c of this!   The resort and the restaurant is extremely sexy! You really do feel as if you've traveled to Spain. I encourage people to take advantage of the local gem!!  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner again. Enjoy our wine, kale salad and octopus salad. This time kale salad had big chunks of avocado, which was pretty refreshing and Manchego cheese was  shaved on a wider grinder and that made a big difference for my taste buds. Love mixture of toasted almonds and red grapes, that what making this salad special.  Octopus salad taste the same like last time but this time they put more dressing on top so I let my boyfriend devour it. Oh bread, how could I forget it!!! The most important part of this restaurant they are baking this most amazing bread so crunchy outside but almost no soft part inside and pesto-dressing come along that you never can have enough.  So we finish our blessed dinner by ordering cram Brulé for dessert, how could I refuse dessert . Omg... that was heavenly delicious!  Don't ever think twice to come to this place beside most amazing freshly cooked food they have alive music and that tapas-bar where chef cooks just for you a delicately of the heart."}
{"text":"I agree whole heartedly with my fellow Yelper, Phil S., who stated, \"...misses the mark for excellence.  Ingredients are wonderfully fresh, and top-quality but...Prado feels a bit overrated...\"  I ordered the beet salad because it sounded so different.  When it arrived, I could not help it, it just fell out of my mouth, I said, \"That is the smallest salad I have ever seen.\"  The waiter (who was awesome) did not skip a \"beet\" (couldn't resist) and responded with, \"Would you like some fresh greens to go with that?\"  You have to love the man and you have to love the professionalism because they did not charge me for that great little side salad.  The atmosphere is just gorgeous, right down to the gorgeous men having drinks poolside at the more casual restaurant, ROQ, across the courtyard.  But the menu, in my opinion, just uses fancy words for sandwiches like \"chicken\" and \"tuna salad,\" and isn't truly different or appealing."}
{"text":"Certo, I am an Italian food snob. But you can't just crush the decor execution and then misdeliver on the food! C'mon Prado, you're better than that.  I dined on the gnocchi which was really overpriced and super bland. Granted I studied abroad in Florence and have high expectations on gnocchi but plz. True italian Gnocchi is al dente :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Had the lamb Tagine  which was great. Leah was excellent. The appetizers and soup was superb."}
{"text":"You know, this place can be slow, as other commentators have remarked. But, it's a classy place, not a McDonald's or Olive Garden. We found all the delicious to be spot on--good quality. Salmon, and gnocchi were our favorites. We dined there three nights in a row too. After so much heat and moving around, it's nice to just sit back and savor. Keep in mind we have a one year old, who went crazy over the pesto roasted tomatoes (gnocchi)."}
{"text":"This please is beautiful.  The food was amazing.  We started with the kale salad, my daughter had the scallops which were cooks perfect.  I had the best gnocchi ever.  They light and creamy.  The service was wonderful and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Poor quality for being in a high end resort and higher prices...but Average overall restaurant. I should have learned my lesson and real reviews first!...I was tired and my husband said let's look for a good restaurant...I said I am tired let's just eat here...how bad could it be? Maybe my expectations were too high I live in Seattle and have also lived in Spain. We had the the dates with bacon, which is a rich dish that my husband ordered. It was done well. We also had the roasted cauliflour that lacked flavor but when I mixed it with the bacon and dates it was pretty good. Everything was cooked to perfection, just lacking flavor. Next I had the crab salad. It was no really a salad but a small clump of crab. I was expecting a salad, unfortunately, it had a fishy taste to me so I sent it back and got the potato soup that was completely void of any flavor. I certainly didn't want to send something back twice. The server was super friendly and attentive. My husband ordered the Paella which I would think they would have done right...but it too was lacking flavor. I will however say that the seafood on it was cooked to perfection...not over cooked like so many people do it. It was just lacking that rich saffron seafood flavor that I have come to expect with Paella. It was definitely a disappointing meal...for what I was expecting and the price....there are much better restaurants in the area. I know one for sure is Elements. We are working on exploring others."}
{"text":"Maitre D' Ann B. was welcoming and suggested a wonderful table for two that offered a great view of the restaurant. I recommend the Butternut Squash Soup to start of any evening. This dish made my wine selection, the Girard Sauvignon Blanc, so nice I asked for another glass with my entre. I completed my meal with the Wild Striped Bass al Cartoccio.   We had a great time and the pictures in front of the fireplace were fun to take.  We recommend Prado for any evening. Great for and Beautiful Staff!"}
{"text":"California and Costa Rica can take a few lessons from Brandon, Grandpa Frankie , Gabby Kyle and Carmen.  Such polite servers!!  I digress, but I must also compliment Steve and Kristina at check in!!!  Victor was also outstanding! We stayed at Four Seasons in Carefree last year and thought it was magnificent HOWEVER Omni Montelucia has them beat!!    KUDOS.   Meal is here.  Must eat!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and large. We loved the illuminated menus. Did not have to hit flashlight on my iPhone. Started with a generous antipasti plate with 4 meats and cheese with olives, grapes and quince paste. Wonderful service. My squid ink linguini was large and came with lobster and scallops. While the seafood was cooked perfectly the pasta was beyond al dents. A little too much time in the bath."}
{"text":"We have been back to Prado several times for dinner and always had a great experience since our original lunch!  Last night we enjoyed a lovely bottle of Belle Glos Pinot Noir with our dinner.  We were seated on the patio with amazing views of Camelback Mountain.  Our server was energetic and so fun and paced our meal perfectly.  I enjoyed the delicious kale salad with almonds and grapes to start and then shared the paella (simply amazing) and the chicken gnocchi with manchego cream sauce with my husband - a seriously delightful dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was sooooo good!!!!   I started out with the cauliflower small plate, and they know how to do cauliflower right!  It was amazing! For dinner I had the Bolognese, and it was as good as what I had in Italy!  Definitely the best pasta I've had in a while! The Tuscan red wine I had was also pretty amazing. Definitely check this place out.  The food was great!"}
{"text":"I have visited a couple of times now, and every time has been a pleasant experience, from the ambience and acoustics of the place, to the friendly and attentive staff and the exquisite food! This last time we visited during the Arizona Restaurant Week , where Arizona restaurants offered a prefix menus in this case (three course meal) for $44, I was intrigued to try what was on the menu, and I felt it was a culinary adventure because usually I will not order those plates. The star of this review is the Avocado Kale Salad...is to die for!!!! PLEASE you need to order and thank me later liking my review hahaha but seriously i have never felt so much enjoyment having healthy food for dinner! Is yummy, is crispy, the seasoning is perfect, without being too sweet or sticky...and those crunchy roasted (peanuts?macadamia?) gosh I loved everything..I think I could be happy just having this salad for the night, the portion is generous! Which I loved because it was DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"My group had a lovely table at the window with a very nice Italian waiter.   We ordered a bottle of the St. Michelle Riesling - one of the best I've had! I ordered the Yellowtail Tuna Crudo - nice combination of citrus with each yellowtail bite but it didn't match anything else on the menu and Tagliatelle pasta - w/ truffle & duck egg, etc.  I should've known better because the pasta was super RICH and packed w/ flavor, maybe too much.  And for dessert, I ordered the Toffee Bread Pudding - it was good  but again should've known better it just made me feel even more disgustingly full.  Service was pretty good, but not a lot of menu options.   I was here the previous night for happy hour.  Interesting menu.  The burrata, almonds, and calamari were the best items on the menu.  The omelette was decent and I didn't try the spicy sausage."}
{"text":"By far, the best thing about Prado is the view from the patio.   The view of the grounds, Kasbah Pool, and Camelback Mountain might be one of the best vantage points in all of Phoenix and Scottsdale.   Your main motivation to come here should not be based on the food. The food is only okay here and you're better off exploring your culinary options - and there are plenty of better ones - elsewhere. I ate here on two occasions, I had the huevos rancheros (for breakfast) and a chicken sandwich (with tomato, avocado, and a side salad) and these were mediocre at best. Service was clunky. Pleasant, but not up to speed at times.  Normally I'm not so critical about hotel and resort dining options. But in a city where the Royal Palms has T. Cook's and Sheraton Wild Horse has Kai, Montelucia's Prado is just so incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been back to Pado 3 more times for breakfast versus dinner. This review will cover their breakfast.  Prado offers a hot and a cold buffett. The hot buffet is a whopping $45 and the cold Buffett is $15. Both include juice and coffee. There are also about 10 menu items which can be ordered a la carte,   I have tried the breakfast burrito which is excellent and the cold buffet which offers a variety of breads, a ton of very fresh fruits, oatmeal, ceral and even Atlantic salmon. Both are excellent, and the burrio at only $12.50 is a value.   Service and ambiance are excellent!"}
{"text":"Prado is an upscale Spanish Style Restaurant located in the Omni Montelucia Resort in Paradise Valley in Scottsdale. The atmosphere is RICH and Majestic. There's a great aroma as you enter from the wood burning grill in the dining room.  They started us off with very crusty sourdough bread and arugula pesto.  For starters we shared the Beet Salad and the Baked Brie. Both were great but I wish I had a steak knife to cut the baked brie....It was extremely delicious but difficult to cut with our butterknives.  For dinner I had the Wood Grilled Half Chicken. It was STUNNING and Delicious.  My husband had the Paella Valenciana. All the proteins were prepared to perfection and were seasoned well. The dish was delicious but didn't have the crust one would expect on a great Paella.  Wild berry Crumble was delicious and was mostly strawberries. Chocolate Bomba was very Chocolate-tee and SUPER RICH.  Our waiter didn't seem like he was there but we got everything we needed in a timely manner.  Incredible Atmosphere and Solid Good Food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place for a few reasons.    #1 - We were staying at Montelucia, and the Montelucia is absolutely beautiful.  #2 - I order in-room dining at least once for breakfast and once for dinner whenever I stay at a hotel or resort.  I was very pleased with what was on Prado's menu.  I also adored sheer size and artful brilliance of the in-room menu of Prado.  #3 - Prado is the main restaurant of Montelucia.  Again- I am a big fan of Montelucia.  So anyhow, this is what we ordered.  Chilaquiles (if a restaurant has chilaquiles on the menu- I try it), eggs benedict, blueberry muffin and chocolate chip muffin.    Chilaquiles was really good actually.  Eggs benedict was nothing special.  Tasted like regular ol' benedict.    The kick was the muffins.  So, I reach over for a blueberry muffin, and I immediately knew that it was going to be disgusting.  Why?  It was ROCK solid.  Bad thing for us is we don't like to waste food.  If it's in front of me, I really do try and eat it.  So I take a bite and taste oats.  Blueberry muffin with oats?  It's not a blueberry muffin.  It's an oat muffin.  Okay, not a big deal.  I call in-room dining and tell them.  They said they actually didn't have blueberry muffins anymore.  Okay fine.  Would've helped if you let me know from the get go instead of assuming that I would like an alternative to what I ordered.  She offers to send up some danishes.  Fair trade, let's do this.  Danishes come up, and the first thing the server says to us is \"these danishes are not that much better than the hard muffins, but there's nothing I can do.\"  Okay.  Sure?  I bite into the danish.  Not good.  Stale, dry and old.  I set that aside.    I took the oat muffin and tried to eat it.  I even started dipping it into my coffee.  A few bites in, my fiance tells me that there's something in it that looks like blueberries, but he can't eat anymore of it because it tastes spoiled.  He's just staring and peeling away at the muffin with this confused look on his face. What?  Blueberries in an oat muffin?  I take a bite out of mine, and I too taste something wrong.  I peel away at the paper and crumble the muffin and low and behold -- there's green mold.  Disgusting.    Takes the Prado manager about a half hour to call me back since no one was available when I called them to tell them about the moldy muffin.  Server comes up, and tells me to make sure to tell the manager because they have been trying to tell the Chef that he can't make bunches of pastries and freeze them since there are no preservatives in them.  Chef doesn't listen to them.  Seriously?  Chef whoever you are - you're a FOOL!  You want to be a premier restaurant at a gorgeous resort, and you willingly serve days old pastries?!   Anyhow - the manager comps the meal, and we go on our merry way.    We had reservations the next day for my fiance's birthday brunch.  We cancelled right away.  We were not taking anymore chances or giving them anymore business."}
{"text":"Wow.  The setting is beautiful.  Our server was knowledgeable (both about the food and the wine), friendly (without being too friendly) and competent.  The food was fantastic.  And both the chef and the sous chef came out to see how we enjoyed our meal.    I notice that one of the other reviewers mentioned how good the Branzino was.  I also had this fish dish and it was exceptional. But so were the braised short ribs my wife selected.  This experience was way beyond anything I would expect at a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to Prado last night for a girlfriend's birthday and I cannot rave more about this place!   Our server, Leah, made our experience so amazing! Not only was she super helpful, she knew just about everything you can imagine about the menu. AND she was totally personable, called us by our names the entire evening. Such a nice added touch!   I got the Branzino and it-was-amazing! So flavorful and the touch of orange was perfect!  It is a little pricey for an everyday kind of meal, but a great place if you're looking for something a little nicer than the usual! :)"}
{"text":"Spent a week at the resort and ate at Prado several times a day. This restaurant is wonderful! The chef's ribeye steak was hands down better than highly rated Mastro's, which we also visited during the week. They have a decent wine by the glass list as well as full bottles.  Our last night at Prado's was the best of all. Chef special foie gras appetizer was the best preparation I've ever had; with a coddled egg, applewood smoked bacon and croutons for the egg yolk. Manager sent over a moscato to go with the dish. Then had to do the ribeye again with wild mushroom risotto. Yummy. To top it off the manager opened a wonderful bottle that is going on the list, Cade, so I could drink by the glass. When we returned to our room the restaurant staff sent over a plate of cookies.  Doesn't get any better than this for food and service."}
{"text":"I think its going to take some time for this place to really come about. While the space is nice the food was kind of mediocre.   Started with the Sea Bream Ceviche.. all I could taste was vinegar and citrus, no fish flavor came though.. had the lamb trio for dinner.. the sausage was raw in the middle, was a super mega turn off! They were quick to replace the sausage but the damage was done.. the chop was alright but could get that anywhere.. the shank was completely flavorless.. now at these prices I was expecting a whole lot more in terms of flavor and execution. Also tried the Fideua' which was salty drippy and fishy, not good at all.   There were a few bright spots.. the service was good as well as both the burrata appetizer and the grilled rib eye.. the steak was one of the tastiest Ive had in quite some time. The churros were pretty good too though these bright spots are not enough to come back. Now M Bar Id go back to.. they have loads of different tapas and are really well priced!  Gawd, what a let down!"}
{"text":"A great new Spanish restaurant in the brand new Intercontinental Hotel in Paradise Valley. Love the ambiance of this place, I feel like I am in some far removed castle somewhere outside Barcelona. The lighting and setting is beautiful.  And the food is as good as Spanish cuisine gets. The octopus salad that we ordered was very small portion wise, like the size of a crab cake. But it was a very tasty little bite. Full of the olive flavors that it was made with.  There were so many tantalizing items on the menu. It was a tough choice between all the paella's and stews. I ended up having the basque cod stew and was delighted with my choice. Usually when I see cod , I am reminded of fish sticks I ate when I was young. But this was not any fish stick cod! It was melty and buttery and went perfect with the veggies in the stew. I could eat this every night. Not only will I be back to eat this wonderful basque cod stew again, I will be back just to chill in their bar and take in the beautiful atmosphere on a lovely AZ winter night."}
{"text":"Great food in a cool space. There was live acoustic guitar all night which was incredible. We loved the fire pits outside too. Good service and a great menu for sharing although you could order separately too. We weren't able to get outside but the patio looked nice (and warmer)"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner here while we stayed at the Intercontinental. We weren't sure if we were going to try it or not, just assuming it was going to be super pricey like the other food and drinks at the resort. Boy were we surprised.   Our meal, including an appetizer, salad, two entrees and wine was just over $100. The food was great! We had a hard time deciding what we were going to order because all of it looked delicious. In the end I got a pasta dish, the Tagliatelli with parmesan, butter and a duck egg yolk. I usually don't order rich dishes like that, but I am glad I did this time! It was so good. My husband got the Spaghetti Nero. It was a pasta with octopus, clams, mussels and a spicy red sauce. He loved his too!   The only downfall of Prado I think is their breakfast buffet. It's $25 and we looked at the food and it wasn't inviting. The scrambled eggs were runny and the other items didn't look very good."}
{"text":"Great service and a beautiful setting.   I had lunch here last week and it was amazing. Soup & balsamic mushroom sandwich. 2 thumbs up. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  We had the Huevos Rancheros, burrito, and French toast.  Carmen our waitress was friendly and kind.  Grandpa Frank, the host, gave us some laughs.  The restaurant was beautiful."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Chic - Le Freak)  Ah, Pra Do! Monte, Lucia Pra Do! Ah, Pra Do! Monte, Lucia Pra Do!  Ah, Pra Do! Monte, Lucia Pra Do! Ah, Pra Do! Monte, Lucia Pra Do!  Have you heard about the Montelucia? Come try it out, I'm sure you'll be amazed Big taste to be had by everyone It's up to you, it surely can be done  Young and old are trying it, I'm told Just one try and you too will be sold It's called 'Prado', they're serving night and day Allow us, we'll show you the way   Prado is located inside the famous Montelucia Resort & Spa.  Man this place brings it when it comes to relaxation and posh.  Overall, the service and atmosphere is top notch and nothing I can complain about.    Food wise, let's start the talking.  My group ordered some lamb, calamari and cherry tomato salad to start.  The lamb was delicious and well cooked.  Nice and tender and extra pink.  The calamari and cherry tomato salad I thought were okay at best.  For my main entree I ordered the Scallops.  Needless to say, the Scallops were cooked perfectly and atop a bed of rice.  Here's the thing, everything was well done and well cooked.   Overall, service was awesome and food was good, but nothing surprising.  However, it's not to say I didn't enjoy my visit.  In the end, it's a pretty cool hangout for drinks simply because of the ambiance. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing! White sangria was fruity not too sweet. The gnocchi was amazing- creamy and flavorful. My husband loved the lamb chops but my gnocchi better. The hostesses were nice but the bartender forgot about us for a half an hour."}
{"text":"I eat here when I stay at the Montelucia, great hotel and a nice restaurant.  I went last night and had the braised beef which was excellent.  I have been coming here for a few years and have always enjoyed the kale salad.  They made it with grapes and some sort of green goddess/avocado dressing.  Sadly they changed this to a different kale salad with sour cherries which was not good.  Please bring it back!"}
{"text":"Location and ambiance cannot be beat but food is subpar. I hope they can reboot the menu because the location is incredible"}
{"text":"Crazy that it was almost 4 years ago that I wrote my initial review of Prado... time flies!  I admit... despite plenty of visits to the Montelucia and to Joya Spa, I haven't been back too many times to Prado to dine.  That is, until a couple of weeks ago when I planned a bachelorette party dinner at Prado for my sister.  There was a group of nine of us and we dined in Prado's private wine cellar.  It was such a fabulous and memorable experience.  I worked with the Sous Chef, Shawn, and he created a custom menu for our group with a limited selection of items from their new dinner menu. We started with shared plates of Chickpea Hummus, Cerignola Olives, and Calamari... all perfect and highly recommended.  We then had a choice of Fried Baby Artichoke or Tuscan Kale Salad.  (I went with the kale and loved it!) Next up was a choice of entree.  I had the salmon which was also amazing, but the girls that had the Prime Flat Iron Steak were extremely psyched with their order too.  Chef Shawn outdid himself and created a special \"happy ending\" (dessert) for us as well: strawberry cheesecake in a jar... again incredible all around!  In addition to the five star food, the service was extremely attentive and the drinks were tasty and strong... just what we needed!  So is Prado good for groups?  It sure is!    Bonus: they have live music on Saturday nights.  You can't go wrong with the views at the Montelucia either... Five sexy stars for Prado (and Chef Shawn)!"}
{"text":"Oh my! The best restaurant so far on my Tucson/ Scottsdale trip! Beautiful space, live music at dinner, fabulous wine. I had the roasted cauliflower appetizer, and it was amazing. The snapper was hot throughout the entire course of the meal. Now hot chocolate dessert even though I have absolutely no room for it! I'm glad I tried it, but it didn't float my boat. The crunchiness of the Filo dough and the chocolate ganache and the vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries -- well it just didn't go well for me together. But the busser suggested the creme Brulé next time. All in all, though, a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"We came here for a day at the spa.  We kicked off our visit to Prado for brunch.  Love the place and the surroundings.  We were greeted right away and had the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside since it was a little warm still.    The server was a little slow in drinks, refills, getting the bill, and she forgot to bring a drink.  She was hard to flag down or get attention of.    I ordered the ham and cheese omlette, it was ok.  Bland, just bearly cooked to done and just not too great.  The potatoes were not fully cooked, still crunchy.    Meh..."}
{"text":"I  love this restaurant! It's elegant, beautiful and the food is always amazing. This is a great place to go on a special occasion. The food and service is superbe and the view and ambiance are gorgeous. One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"WOW Alessandro Stratta is back in town!  Easter Brunch was amazing. So happy that we have a chef back in Phoenix / Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time at Prado, overall the food was very good. The menu options were sufficient but not overwhelming. It was a slow Sunday evening and the service was very good too. Great atmosphere - would recommend for couples and special gatherings. The patio seating was comfortable despite cooler temps of mid-October evening in AZ."}
{"text":"Wonderful anniversary dinner! Excellent service, delicious food, beautiful ambience . We just found this local gem and we will be back. Chef came out twice to congratulate us and each time brought a complementary item, first an amazing eggplant tapas plate and then a dessert PLATTER with 3 made in house delicious desserts (not tastings but full size desserts). Can not think of a better way to celebrate a special event or just have a delicious dinner in a beautiful relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Upon my arrival to the hotel, I wandered into Prado's bar area until my room was ready.  The staff was soooo helpful and friendly.  Ann and Angela took the time to show me around the resort and talk about the Scottsdale area.   During my stay, I had an early dinner and the service was average (not Ann or Angela), as was the food.  Granted, the menu was not my style, but I can still appreciate good food when I eat it.  The wine choices were poor.  :(  But the atmosphere...the atmosphere inside and out was spectacular!!  It was romantic and inviting.  They had live music, which was relaxing and fun."}
{"text":"LUNCH:   Came here for a late lunch pre-dinner snack. Even though it was prior to Happy Hour we were still offered to order from the Tapas menu.   We decided to share the Blue Prawn BLT sandwich from the Lunch menu and the Fried Calamari from the Tapas menu (see pics)   The Sandwich was just Delicious I loved every bite of the chewy ciabatta, the butter lettuce, pimento spread, the tender grilled prawns and the flavorful bacon! The accompanying fries were Hot, Fresh and Tasty Crisp too!   The Calamari was Very Fresh and Tender, loved that as well!   The waiter was oblivious and had to be waved down just so we could pay and get out of there.  We were one of 2 or 3 couples in the restaurant at this time and service was painfully slow, Thank God for the generous bread basket, which by the way had several varieties of fresh bread with olive oil for dipping.   DINNER:   The Bar was packed with obvious locals dining on HH Tapas and drinks. The restaurant itself was pretty full as well.   We were seated right away and greeted by our server Ashley who despite being very busy took very good care of us and was very knowledgeable about the menu.   We started with a Wild Arugula Salad and Fried Zucchini Blossoms. (see pics)  Both were Absolutely Divine. The salad was lightly dressed and served atop this thin crisp bread/cracker then topped with tomato and Spanish cheese I would liken to a more pungent Parmesan. Delicious!   The Squash Blossom were filled with Ricotta, Mozzarella and Salami....WOW! These were Amazingly Tasty I wish there were more of them!   For our Entrees My Husband chose the Rigatoni with Bacon and I chose the Pork Chop (see pics)   Ashley our server explained that this was Carabuda Pork, the finest Pig in the world and let me tell you it did not disappoint!   Served on top of brown rice with toasted pine nuts and figs drizzled with grape must, it was just unbelievably good, better than a steak. I highly recommend it, my husband loved it as well, I shared with him and he was just in awe of how good it was.   His pasta was delicious as well with fresh tomato sauce, basil and bacon! Yum!   For we ordered the Churros and a Peach Tart (see pics)   If you've never had a fresh churro you don't know what your missing! OMG! They were Fabulous! The Peach tart was quite yummy too though I though it could have used more peaches!    BREAKFAST BUFFET:   On the weekend they serve the buffet with a couple menu items.  It was just OK, their fresh fruit was good, the omelet bar was so-so, service again was slow, waiting for drink and salt and pepper, they were missing bowls for the oatmeal.  Not much to say here.   WRAP UP:   I would absolutely eat here again just not for breakfast. Dinner was Amazing and our lunch was Delicious too despite waiting a bit too ling.  I must give 5 stars for our food during dinner though!"}
{"text":"We had a group dinner in one of their private rooms... the wine room, which as decent, obviously wines all around us, but a nice room for a group of 10.  Anyways, the food we had was amazing... be sure to try the the appetizer - DRUNKEN BREAD (Cabrales fonduta', White Wine, Garlic, Herbs).  For my entree I had the RIGATONCINI w/  Sweet & Spicy 'Schreiner's' Lamb Sausage, Heirloom Legumes, Local Greens,   Charred Tomatoes, Chili, Pecorino.  It was perfect with a nice kick to it. Definitely recommend it.  And for dessert...PRADO SUNDAE House Made Vanilla Gelato | Apple Wood Bacon | Caramelized Bananas  Amarone Cherries | Warm Chocolate Sauce | Roasted Almonds |  Whip Cream | Biscotti Crumble... amazing... my first bacon dessert and it was worth it.  Also, try the 'DULCE DE LECHE' BREAD PUDDING   Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Vanilla Anglaise | Chantilly Cream.  And get yourself a mojito while you are there, surprisingly good.  Of course this is the main restaurant at the Montelucia Resort, so expect \"hotel pricing.\"  The menus are also seasonal, so my recommendations now might be completely different when you go there."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Omni resort for my birthday weekend and we came to Prado one morning for brunch and had a fabulous meal. Our server was super sweet and very accommodating with my two crazy toddlers. We had a beautiful table inside but right by the doors where you can see the entire camelback mountain. The restaurant itself is super classy and I love the Spanish influences here. They had an option for a buffet which came to about $30 and I absolutely recommend this for a Sunday brunch. I mean, it includes everything, lots of meats, cheeses, an omelette station, lox, pastry galore, just an overall beautiful meal with tons of croissants, scones, I mean anything you can think of this place does it. I can't vouch for their dinner options as we ate out of the resort but I absolutely recommend coming here for brunch especially if you're staying in the hotel.  My husband was able to sneak in a cake for me and the server brought it out in the end, as well as ordering a champagne bottle from them leaving me a very happy birthday girl. A beautiful place, with wonderful service, a delightful staff and delicious food all around. The prices are a little high if you order a la carte, but then again, you get this amazing view so that can't be beat. Prado, I fell in love with you just a little bit. If we stay at the resort again, I will make sure to come visit you soon."}
{"text":"I don't write many yelp reviews but I thought that I would do one on Prado because it has changed a lot since my last visit and people might not know.   I've been here 2 -3 times now with my girlfriend and others.  However, the first two times were about a year ago when the restaurant had more of a spanish theme.   We went this past week (11/19/10) and were disappointed with the new italian menu.   The menu differed greatly from the one posted online, and also the one posted near the front door. Our guest was very disappointed because he had picked out what he wanted to eat while having a drink at the bar before dinner, and none of his selections were on the dinner menu once we sat down.   I ordered a calamari appetizer that was an interesting idea but did not taste very good (not traditional fried calamari). It tasted very earthy, slightly like dirt.  I had a crab pasta entree that was good but not memorable. My girlfriend ordered a whole (roasted?, cant remember) Branzino with gnocci. The gnocci were good, but the fish was overcooked and dry.  Most importantly, the new menu no longer carries the amazing churros that Prado used to serve for dessert. Sometimes we went there just for churros. The new menu features desserts from the Julia Baker chocolate shop next door, which we also visited after dinner. The shop is cute and the chocolates are great, but the churros are sorely missed.  We also had some awesome paella from the old menu that was much better than anything we ordered off the new menu.   Overall, our tourist guest was disappointed and I am going to remove Prado from our lineup.  There are many other comparable choices in the area that I prefer.  Among others, T Cook's and Lon's at the Hermosa offer the same fancy resort feel, and have better food in my opinion, now that Prado's menu has changed."}
{"text":"Made reservations through Opentable on 12/22 for reservations at 8:15 pm at Prado on 12/31/12 for a New Years and my birthday celebration.  Called Prado the next day to confirm just to be sure.  On the day of the reservation, hostess called me and left a msg to see if we were doing New Years Eve menu or not.  Upon calling back, we were notified that there were no 8:15 spots like we had booked and there was only seating at 6 or 9 and only a New years eve menu was to be offered at either $90 (at 6pm) or $150 (at 9 pm) per person.  This was quite inconvenient especially since I am a vegetarian and was counting on being able to order from the regular dinner menu.  Manager had no suitable solutions to offer us and we cancelled.  Extremely disappointed in opentable and Prado.  WIll not dine here in the future and will unrecommend to others."}
{"text":"Good service. Nice atmosphere. Rubbery burger. 6 raviolis for 18 bux."}
{"text":"visited Prado for my 22nd birthday dinner. Sad to say that this place is just OK. We started off with the burrata appetizer served with foccacia bread (which was untoasted). flavor was good but hard to enjoyed with cold, chewy bread. I had the sea scallops with chorizo risotto. Dish came with 3 beautifully cooked and seasoned scallops and mediocre risotto. The mister got the gnocchi dish which was excellent, however portion size was SO small. Enjoyed two cocktails one with some ginger syrup, great. I do not recommend the purple haze drink. Overall, the menu selection was small and the cuisine did not meet the standards of fine dining. Total ripoff and I would not return."}
{"text":"Grandpa and Carmen are the best.  I think people mistakenly review the restaurant with the hotel etc.  This is the place for Sunday brunch! The views are truly amazing!  We eat at only the finest restaurants and I'm telling you this is a great place!  Relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Not outstanding, but not junk either. I had the Squid Ink Angel Hair Pasta ($29) and my wife had the Rib Eye ($42). Pretty pricey for what you get, but we are staying at Montelucia Resort for our honeymoon and aren't counting pennies this week. The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable and the employees were really nice. I think we'll try something off property for our next dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.... food was decent but expensive, of course being a hotel restaurant. Service was the pits. Just thought I would share."}
{"text":"Prado restaurant supports the Spanish village theme of Montelucia Resort with a wide-open communal atmosphere that houses both the restaurant and the lounge. A cozy space is carved out for the lounge where live music is often being performed. There is also a patio that takes advantage of the stupendous views of Camelback Mountain.   The meal I had at Prado was spectacular. Each item my guest and I tried was uncomplicated, yet with an air of sophistication. Each dish was clean and healthful, allowing the natural flavors of the food to shine through."}
{"text":"I wish I can give zero star for their poor, unacceptable service. Neither the waiter nor the manager knew the cocktail my friend ordered, which had been on their menu but discontinued at some point; instead of offering alternatives, the manager told the waiter to \"make something similar to blah blah\" in a very snappy manner. We could very well hear you - only two feet away from you. Strangely excellent quality service coming from a bar in a renowned Omni Resort!"}
{"text":"Probably my worst dining experience ever. Waited over 10 minutes after being seated for waiter to come over. We decided on breakfast buffet -- BIG mistake.  Boring items -- undercooked eggs, cold pan cakes, bacon, sausage, fruit, oatmeal, yogurt parfait and omelets to order.  No bowls were out for the oatmeal -- had to ask 2 different people to get me one. Then discovered were out of oatmeal and were making more. Then no yogurt parfait -- asked to have some more made to the waiter.  Waited over 15 minutes and still nothing.  Waiter then just came to our table and without saying a word, placed the bill for $58 on our table.  Never came to fill our empty water and juice glasses and never apologized for them being out of the oatmeal and parfait. As we were leaving, overheard couple in front saying they too would never return."}
{"text":"Omni Hotel & Resorts 4949 E. Lincoln Drive Scottsdale, AZ  In keeping with my tradition of visiting restaurants during Arizona Restaurant Week, we visited Prado. Prado is a Spanish themed restaurant located in the hotel.  Companion and I arrived at 6:30 and were promptly seated. The hotel has valet parking, however your ticket will be stamped by the restaurant which will give you free parking.   Restaurant week features a prix fixe menu which in this case was $44 per person. I started out with a roasted beet salad set with frisee greens, balsamic vinegar and some blue cheese. The beets were nicely tender and were beautifully sweet. Companion had a mini loaf of bread filled with Brie cheese and served with a lemon curd. The mixture of flavors was wonderful. We also ordered their crispy Calamari which was absolutely fabulous.  For main courses, we both ordered the Paella. Companions was cooked nicely, and mine was mush. Instead of properly cooked socarrat which is the crispy rice that should be on the bottom of a good paella, I had mushy rice and peas. The maitre d came over to our table and asked how the dinner was. I told him honestly that it was fair. He offered to take the dish back and change it for something else, which I appreciated but declined to do. However, it should be noted that he did let the chef know about this problem. Without the socarrat, paella just isn't paella regardless of how good the flavor might be.  For dessert, companion ordered the Crema Cata, which is very similar to a creme brulee. Companion pronounced it very good. For myself, I ordered the Berry Crumble, which was loaded with berries and was quite tasty with a ball of vanilla ice cream on the top.  Dings - The dining room was on the noisy side due to the bar being in the same area with a T.V. set blaring and showing a game in which many were cheering. It would be nice if there were some way to separate the bar from the dining room.  There is a guitar player in the front of the dining room trying his best to be entertaining. Unfortunately, the bass notes carry throughout the dining room but the melody is totally lost.  The restaurant is clean, and service is excellent.  4 stars for cleanliness, service, and outstanding appetizers."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Particularly enjoyed the Veal over Polenta. Divine. Staff was really friendly"}
{"text":"I love Prado.  I have dined there several times and every time the food options are better and better. The Halibut is out of this world.  The service can be slow at sometimes but the atmosphere and live music makes up for it.  Prado practices the slo food movement and I think that is why the servers take their time.  The Mbar in the front of the venue has happy hours that are a lot of fun $5 wine and tapas which allow you to sample the menu at an affordable price.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The Omni Montelucia resort is beautiful! The resort's main restaurant Prado is great for casual bar food or elegant special occasions. My friend and I came on Saturday night and sat outside when the weather was perfect! The atmosphere was so elegant and cozy, service was very accommodating and the food was delicious! This is a great place to escape into the Spanish Moroccan style scenery and imagine being in another country....Prado is definitely one of my favorite Valley spots."}
{"text":"$23+ tax seemed a bit pricey for a breakfast buffet, but always being in the adventurous spirit, we went to Prado to try out the buffet before indulging in a spa treatment at Joya.  All the ingredients here are fresh and well prepared.  The hot buffet today consisted of pancakes, breakfast quesadilla, applewood bacon, pork sausage, and roasted potatoes.  The bacon was excellent- perfectly crispy, not at all chewy, with great subtle smokey flavor, not too salty at all.  The potatoes were also excellently cooked,  as well as the sausage.  The quesadilla was decent, but tasted a bit too cheesy for me.  They have an omelet and Belgian waffle station as well, made to order.  The omelet I had was excellent- very fluffy with fresh ingredients.  The cold selections are also diverse and flavorful as well.  There is a wide selection of fresh fruit, pastries, cheese and bread, smoked salmon, and divine fruit and granola parfaits.  I'm sure these parfaits aren't really that healthy for you since they taste so good, but they are probably some of the best breakfast items I've had in a long time!  The yogurt in the parfait is whipped to a light airy consistency, and sprinkled with spiced granola, crisp nuts, candied fruit, and fresh fruit.  The buffet includes juice, coffee, tea, and milk.  Service was a bit sluggish initially, but picked up later on.  There is a wide selection of juices to choose from, and the coffee is very smooth.    Generally, this isn't a buffet I'll be going to a whole lot, but if I'm in the mood for splurging and indulging in a buffet for breakfast, I'll know where to go."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Long wait for server to take our order for drinks. Had to grab the waiter's attention and he acted like he forgot about us and made it seem like we were the ones taking a long time deciding. No. We ordered. Then the wait. Ordered and appetizer (calamari) which came quickly enough and tasted good. Then the real wait for the entrees. 45 minutes or so. Food tasted pretty good but small portions. No follow up from the waiter. We were done with our food and finally he came by but to deliver food to the table next to us. No acknowledgement at all. Seriously? We got up and left. We're staying at the resort so we figure they'll bill the room anyway. Awful service. Much like the rest of these reviews."}
{"text":"BAR ONLY--wandered down here one night from the Camelback Inn just to check the place out (it's only about a 15-minute walk, with a dramatic view of CB mountain all the way). We stopped in at the bar and had a few drinks; the whole place has a very pre-fab feel like some set designer's version of an Italian estate, which seemed jarring after the authenticity of the Camelback. The drink menu is extensive, though they were out of a few things. It's a little spendy, but not too awful. Seems like they may do quite a bit of group business at the hotel, because there was a group of drunk, loud douchebag conventioneers at one end of the bar.  I will say the bar staff was wonderful--very friendly and attentive, but after a couple of drinks I felt like I'd gotten all I ever would out of this place."}
{"text":"So this was good. Fine. And damn expensive. I mean, I like good food and I'm willing to pay for it. To the tune of about $2.50/bite of brie, I GUESS I really like to pay for it.   The paella was pretty good, but it didn't have the rustic, crusted-to-the-pot delight that paella at other restaurants (for me) had in the past. It was really a nice copper-ish pot with buttered rice and veggies and a dollop of chimichurri sauce on top. It was good, but expensive and not REALLY paella IMO.  We had excellent service and it was romantic and perfect outside with the dim lights, but I might have still left hungry having spent over $100 for dinner (minus the drinks). Hmph."}
{"text":"To me, this is a typical resort restaurant.  They are working very hard to make sure their restaurant is as upscale as possible & by concentrating on that, they miss the mark in other important areas (food, comfortable atmopshere...).  I have a few pet peeves--when they insist on putting your napkin on your lap.  When they trick you into buying bottled water.  Things like that.  I also don't like when they tell you a fish is very similar to sea bass and it's just tilapia in disguise.  Not a fan.    I stayed at this resort and LOVED it.  But I think they went in the wrong direction with their restaurant.  They really should take a lesson from BLT Steak down the street on what a more successful restaurant is doing and what the customers want."}
{"text":"You are definitely paying for the resort's view when you come here. The outdoor patio is alongside a beautiful fountain row, surrounded by palm trees, with a breathtaking view of the Camelback mountains. The high arches of the patio give it a palatial feel.   We opted for the continental breakfast ($26/person) since most of the main items that were featured on the breakfast menu (~15/dish) were included, along with coffee and orange juice. There is an omelette bar, waffles, breakfast tacos, potatoes, lox, yogurt parfait, and fruit. The food was mediocre at best-- I had very little motivation to finish any of the cooked dishes. The quality was what I would expect at a Denny's or hospital cafeteria (albeit a higher end hospital). The yogurt parfait was unfortunately the best item; the waffles weren't bad.   Especially since I was staying at the resort so had already basqued in the view and there are so many great places to eat in Scottsdale, I should've been less lazy and left for lunch."}
{"text":"I visited Prado for my father in-laws birthday. Our host had our reservation for 10 in the private dining area ready. To start, I had the rebel cocktail, which had fresh raspberries and pomegranate syrup, it was refreshing. Next we had four boards of assorted meats, cheeses, jelly and nuts as an appetizer. The manchego cheese was really good, especially paired with the apricot jelly. The boards also came with lamb chops which were seasoned tender and cooked just right.   For my entree I had the lobster, scallops and pasta special. The lobster was a bit chewy and was not easy to cut. The scallops however, were cooked perfectly.   My only complaint would be our service. Because we were in the private dining area, it seemed we were forgotten. Our water was not being refilled and it was taking to long for us to request more drinks, food etc.  Overall a pleasant visit, I will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"The customer service here is unbelievable. The employees seem genuinely happy to work there and they treat the guests like family. I was very impressed with this resort in general. But i particularly love this restaurant and the food there.   Our first night there we ordered all of the salads and they were the best salads I've ever had. Cauliflower, beets... and everything was very fresh.     On our final night we ordered a lot of the seafood. Again delicious and fresh. I'm taking a star off because the kitchen should be prepared for demand and we didn't get to have what I will call the most Incredible and accurate crème brûlée I have ever had stateside. The best!    Also the elderly man who does brunch service. I want to say he was called \"grandpa frank?\" What a delightful man. It's a fantastic brunch with a plenty of fresh fruit and cheeses. Lots of egg dishes and a ton of pastries/sweets (including the crème brûlée)     I will be definitely come back time and time again."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here during my stay and was thoroughly disappointed. While my over easy eggs had a runny yoke, they had been tragically cooked too quickly. They were tough and difficult to cut. My bacon was hard, dry and overdone. The service was good, but I'm not sure if that would entice me to return."}
{"text":"hubs and I stayed at Montelucia to celebrate our 4th year anniversary. Starving after checking in the resort so we headed straight to Prado.  we were greeted warmly and was seated right away. the hostess was really nice, she checked on us a few times during the meal and was very helpful in recommending food. Our server was also great. she even insisted to give us a anniversary dessert even though we were too full.  we're glad we took that dessert though because that banana foster was to die for!  We had crab cake and white kale salad for starters.  both were fabulous. had pasta while hubby had the steak... very good. drinks were good as well and servers were really helpful.  we also came back for Sunday brunch and had the same server. brunch was a bit busy and the omelette chef was a bit slow but it didn't bother us.  would love to be back."}
{"text":"From the best sour dough bread & pesto before the meal to an awesome margarita & the most tender calamari I've ever eaten to the Sea Bass that melted in my mouth & had an incredible sauce with capers & potatoes.  Prado was so good!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and made the mistake of sitting at a high top by the bar since there was a wait for seating in the main dining room. We had the brunch buffet so the food was easy to access but no one ever came to wait on us so had to ask the hostess for utensils and a random waiter for drinks who never followed up with us again (I assume they thought we were being helped by someone else). We had to get the hostess to track down another random waiter to get our check printed too.  I like buffets in that there is minimal interaction with wait staff but SOME I think is needed. You know, so you can have a water while you're choking down your dry pancake. I think it was $20 for the buffet and $26 for bigger buffet option where you could get sausage links, bacon and pancakes. That isn't clearly labeled though so just look at the menu at what the continental $20 buffet entails if you don't want the bigger one. The continental comes with a waffle an omelet station where you could build your own. That cook did make me a pretty great omelet. Also, the restaurant setting itself was nice- and glad I tried it since I hadn't before but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  The food is spectacular - the atmosphere wonderful.  The food is \"clean\" not mucked up.  The staff is great.  Poolside lunch is great too!  And they dont sweat you for being a \"local\" to enjoy the pool/resort!  This is my favorite resort in Scottsdale, hands down!  Mainly because I don't feel like I am in Scottsdale!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were greeted by a gentlemen in a pink sport coat. He proudly introduced himself as Grandpa Frank and asked us to choose our seating. Breakfast and our service was great. Thank you Cindy for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I give this place two starts because it is very pretty. The restaurant is picture perfect and why shouldn't it be? It is after all in the Montelucia Resort. The food on the other hand was pretty bad. It was bad compared to other hotels and to other restaurants. I was here for breakfast so I am not sure what dinner or lunch is like. I ordered the mushroom and cheese omelet that came with potatoes. My bf ordered the spinach frittata that came with fruit. Neither of our dishes were tasty. Both of us couldn't finish it. This is the key piece of information here. I always finish my plate. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I was very sad at my situation. There just was no taste to it. Completely bland and not worth $15."}
{"text":"I can't help but laugh at the name Prado, being in Paradise Valley, I always think of old wealthy ladies with their PradA bags eating here.   Anyway, the restaurant is the least attractive part of the resort, and still blows a lot of places away in terms of beauty. If you get a chance to tour the property, you'll see what I mean. The spa, rooms, and other public areas are unbelievable. I looked for a place where they skimped and could not find one... then I walked into Prado, and lo and behold, it may be that skimp.  I dined on pallea, a few tapas plates, and had a couple of samplings from their extensive wine list. The Chorizo sausage is amazing, but where they lost me was with the seafood. Maybe they are concerned with food-bourne allergies a little too much because I've never had mussels that were soooo rubbery.   The bar area is gorgeous as well, and has plenty of seating in the lounge as well as at the bar. I might reccommend someone to come in and check out the bar, have a small plate, and peace out. Try other, more well established restaurants in the area, but don't pass up the Montelucia without seeing it. The place really is jaw-dropping."}
{"text":"Went back to the Montelucia on Saturday night with another couple. Drinks and appetizers at Mbar and then dinner at Prado. I absolutely love this place. All four meals were mouth watering good and the service was amazing. Truly a favorite. Head over before sunset. The grounds are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Classy. Food is usually a fusion of sorts depending on the Chef the have working for them at the time. This changes super frequently. But the food is always top notch. Ambience is very elegant and a place to take a date to impress."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beautiful food presentation. Brunch was solid but not excellent.  The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.  Recommendation to management: either shut the outside doors or ensure birds don't come inside. Seems to be an issue for the Phoenix and Scottdale areas in general."}
{"text":"Painful. The food was pretty good, but for the price, I would've expected better food and at least a semblance of meaningful service. Truth-be-told, the entire Omni Montelucia resort seems to be in a fog of lousy service and about a 25-minute time delay.  The only reason why you'd eat here is because you're too drunk leave the property and too intoxicated to care about: 1) time, 2) money, 3) indifference from staff. The only bright spot was the busser from somewhere in Eastern Europe who couldn't speak much English but she was delighted to fill our waters -- maybe no one else showed up to work that day.  (Which is entirely plausible since it appeared that our server was also the bartender and clearly had too much on his hands to deal with us.)  As I write this, I realize that this lousy experience can only be chalked-up to one thing: mismanagement.  Don't reward mismanagement, go someplace else."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend this weekend for my birthday and loved it! Service was great, decor is spot on and the food was fantastic. I recommend the mushroom risotto - it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and even better staff and drinks. Probably one of the most hidden hotspots around town. I'm telling you, just try it one time. You'll be back...I promise!"}
{"text":"Review is for Breakfast brunch/buffet:    We actually finally got to try Prado after we checked out, for the breakfast buffet.  It consisted of an omelet station,  french toast, mini breakfast burritos, sausage, fruit, toast, cereal and milk and pastries.    I had the egg white omelet with ham, cheese, spinach a slice of french toast, fruit, coffee and orange juice and it was all very good, above average.   The price is $25 per person which included food, orange juice, coffee at the buffet,  I believe that is comparable to other resort buffets, or Las Vegas prices.  The last thing I wanted to mention is that if you want to have alcoholic drinks you can go for the $45 buffet which includes food and all you can drink Mimosa's or bloody Marys."}
{"text":"Went there together with four other people for brunch.  We got the outdoor seating we had requested on the covered patio.  Initially the service wasn't great as we weren't contacted right away by a waiter, but later became very good.  I decided to do the \"full breakfast buffet\" but they also have a \"continental breakfast buffet\" and a la carte.   The restaurant is very nice with a rustic touch. The outdoor patio has a long fountain close by and there is a fabulous view of Camelback Mountain.  I must say that re breakfast buffet was a little disappointing as I had expected many more different choices, more like a Las Vegas-style buffet.  It is certainly sufficient but I think that a 5-star resort should do better for the price of $26.00.   Alex, our service was very attentive with a big smile on his face."}
{"text":"I went to Prado during Restaurant Week with my favorite dining companion Mike B.  It was my \"Last Supper\" before getting my tonsils out this week.  Since it's Friday night and I just had Jello for dinner, I thought this is a good time to reminisce about Prado and write my very 1st Yelp review.     We had early reservations for Sunday night.  Service was great, waiter was handsome (sure, I say it matters), decor was very comfortable and nice.  Since it was during restaurant week, our selections were from a limited menu, but the $29 included a glass of wine.  Bonus!   I have to assume that the Restaurant week menu has smaller servings than the regular menu, because for one of our appetizers, the Day Boat Scallops, was actually one scallop.  It was good, but I added salt to it, which I rarely do.  For dinner I really enjoyed the flat iron steak, very tender, great flavor.   For dessert we tried a Hazelnut cake and a chocolate cake with gelato.  I thought the Hazelnut cake was the big winner - light and delicious.  I think it's hard to really judge a restaurant during restaurant week, just because it's difficult to tell how things like portions translate to the regular menu (like the one scallop).  Now if only I had been smart and scheduled my tonsils to come out AFTER restaurant week, I'd have more restaurants to review.  ;)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all- poor service, poor attention to drinks, orders etc. our server rarely made it by to check on us regarding food drinks and water- order was messed up and it took til the end of my meal to fix it! For what you pay at such a nice upscale resort , service was far below par!"}
{"text":"Such a gem in a beautiful desert landscape. Hidden behind the walls of the Montelucia resort in Paradise Valley, you may never know about this place until someone told you about it. Service is impeccable and you have a kitchen full of chefs to create anything your heart could ever want. It's a great place to have a date, sitting and overlooking the pool on the patio, or having brunch and mimosas with the girls -- or guys.   Seriously. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Tried out their short rib on restaurant week menu, definitely one of the best ever, tender meat with perfect flavor. Salad and cooked broccolini also delicious with just the right amount of dressing that mixed well.  Cheesecake as dessert however was a bit lacking but not bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night w my husband for the first time. Not my first time at Montelucia but was my first time having dinner at Prado. The ambience and interior was very romantic and quaint. Perfect for date night. Our server Amal was super attentive and knowledgeable of the menu n wine selection pairings.   We started off w the rioja wine. Amazing recommendation from our server Amal. And the bacon wrapped dates was fantastic. It was grilled to perfection.  As my entree, I got the short rib and my husband got the scallops. Both so delicious!! It was heaven in my mouth.   I definitely recommend this place. The food service and ambiance was perfection. Super romantic!!"}
{"text":"As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.  I had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK.   To top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good.   I would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road."}
{"text":"So we asked the waiter about dinner, he recommended  we go to El charros,  should say it all. Service was what you would expect from a diner or a fast food restaurant,  but this was not one if those. We decided to stay here instead of the Phoenician. What a mistake. So far!!!! The whole hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  Not close to the 4.6 stars it's rated as a hotel but restaurant is not in  the league  of a 4 star, but to say it is a 5 star hotel resort ha ha!!!  (2 star works).    Food was very 2nd class.   Service was less.  Had dinner reservations for a birthday  day celebration  tonight here but we're going to El Charros  instead! !!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was great! I didn't eat in the restaurant for dinner, but I did order food to eat in my room! Breakfast: I had the huevos rancheros on one day and the brioche French toast on another day. The huevos was excellent and had good presentation! The French toast was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The portion size was huge though, which was good and the fruit was very fresh! I had an iced coffee that was good, although I wish they had served the milk separate because it was a little too milky for me. Service: The service for breakfast was good and quite quick, although on July 4th the restaurant was quite busy and it took a while to get our food.  Atmosphere: I would recommend getting an indoor seat because during the summer it is way too hot to sit outside, and I was there in the morning!  Dinner: My parents ordered a burrata appetizer which was so delicious, although the amount of cheese was disappointingly small. They also got the braised beef with potato gnocchi, which was so so so good! The portion size is definitely quite large, with two big hunks of meat. I got a kids pasta, which was pretty standard.  Price: I would say that the food is a bit on the pricier side, but it's not too bad when you take the portion size into consideration! Overall it was a pretty good experience, especially for a hotel restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our family had 9am reservation for Father's Day and it was a perfect time since there were very few people in the restaurant. It was quiet and the service was great. We all decided to get the breakfast buffet which was $26.00/person. It came with 2 cooked to order items. Omelets with a nice selection of fillings and a huge, fabulous waffle that was light flaky with just the right amount of crunch. Several baked items to choose from like cinnamon buns that were delicious, sticky, crumbly topping with a little bit of bacon on top.  There was actually more food than we could eat; bacon,  sausage, french toast, potatoes, scrambled eggs and sausage besides from fruit, yogurt.  Our waiter was very prompt with refills on water and coffee and removing dirty plates. It is a lovely restaurant in a  perfect setting, right at the foot of Camelback mountain."}
{"text":"We visited Prado for their NYE event while visiting Scottsdale. They had a deal for a four-course prefix menu (vegetarian options available), champagne (one bottle per couple), and dancing/party favors for $125 per person (plus gratuity and taxes). Out of all the NYE events in the area, this one seemed best in terms of price and festivities.  The restaurant is beautifully set behind the grand fountain at the Omni Hotel. The indoor space is large and it seemed trendy but not too crowded early in the evening.   Dinner: For the first course we got a Moroccan lentil soup, which was tasty and rich. We then moved onto to an arugula and date salad, which was small but delicious. For the main course, there were 2 options. The gnocchi was amazing- smooth and silky, and the pasta was melt-in-you-mouth good! The quinoa lasagna on the other hand was quite lackluster. It had too much of a raw feel without enough flavor. For dessert we got the key lime pie and chocolate cake. Both were great, but the key lime pie won by a narrow margin.   The champagne bottle was top-shelf (Verve) and a live band played the night away. We toasted the new year with party favors and a sea of balloons falling from the ceiling in the center of the dance floor. The dancing area was definitely crowded and we felt there wasn't enough space for the number of people there.  All-in-all a pricey dinner (over $150 per person), above average food, but a great experience! If we were to do it again, it would have been better to have dinner elsewhere and then visited Prado for drinks, dancing, and NYE favors later in the night."}
{"text":"Went to The Prado at the Omni Resort at Montelucia for the first time on a Saturday evening in the course of entertaining out-of-town guests.  Superb job on the overall design of the restaurant, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.     Appetizers (warm manchego and caramelized cauliflower) were excellent, as were the entrees (lamb chops, salmon, center cut filet and lemon chicken).  Service was exceptional, and an accomplished guitarist provided background music (Ottmar Liebert-style selections).  This is an easy place to recommend."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Omni for our 2nd honeymoon trip in Arizona. Went to Prado for a late dinner, the menu was mostly just appetizers and small plates. Had the Spanish marguerite pizza. Which was amazing! Husband had the lamb chops and loved it, it was a small portion so he wished he would of got something else or 20 of those(haha!). Breakfast buffet was good, had all the necessary items: bacon sausage mini breakfast burritos fruit and the best omelet station ever! We got served by Carmen both mornings and we absolute LOVED her! Hands down the best server we've had in a while! Don't forget to try their pineapple mimosa"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Omni for the weekend and the Prado was our breakfast spot. Grandpa Frank is the sweetest man on earth. He took great care of us and his hospitality was one of a kind. Kind, welcoming and hilarious. Wouldn't have been the same without him. The Omni is lucky to have him!"}
