{"text":"Tartare is amazing! Best tartare I've ever tried. The iceberg salad is so weird and amazing! I love how the food here is so rich, it's really good. The hen, the lime pie, the fries with the bloody mary? aioli, are really good as well. 
The only thing I would definitely not recommend (if they still have it on the menu) is that chorizo, pork belly, olive thing. It's comes out as something you wouldn't expect and it's kind of gross because it's just drenched in oil and the flavours don't match lol. 
The things I thought were whatever were, the clams - I mean you can't go wrong with clams and butter, but if that's your thing, get it! 
Love this place! BTW, if you can not sit at the bar, do it. Because the seats at the bar are insanely uncomfortable. After an hour, my butt got numb and I had to stand."}
{"text":"What an experience! I could eat here all my life. 

The food was phenomenal, the decor tasteful and the service impeccable. If you manage to find a table, do yourself a favour and order the ribeye steak, broccoli & brussel sprouts! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great place! I lived in Nyc and Philly (both great places for food) since recently moving back to Toronto, I have not been impressed with the quality of food. This place was exceptional! Can't wait to try Alo!"}
{"text":"Reliable food and wonderful staff, as usual. the appetizers are much more interesting than the mains though. Extra votes for the iceberg wedge, scallop and lemon pie."}
{"text":"Erm... I think they are trying to pass flank steak off as ribeye. Inconsiderate. Otherwise standout service. Pretty space. Good sound system."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype because it was just okay. Wouldn't say it is worth the wait unless you are nearby the area and can come back when you are up especially since they don't take reservations. 

The menu is kind of small and I had difficulty in choosing a dish (I normally don't prefer to order seafood or steak mains which took up at least 50% of the menu) so I opted for their famous burger and upgraded to Aloette fries to share.

Burger was pretty salty but decent. Aloette fries on the other hand are highly questionable. It is like fries drizzled with some cheese that you can't taste but made the fries more soggy and greasy, and lots of sriracha. Doesn't go well at all and honestly the regular plain fries tasted better. Many other customers actually left a good chunk of their fries as I saw the staff throw out lots of leftovers from 3-4 people. If you go, JUST GET REGULAR FRIES!!

The bread and dip they give to start is great though, haha."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best designed restaurants I have visited in the city. It felt like being in fancy art deco train-car diner.

Took a while for a table, but it was worth the wait. Generous portions at totally reasonable price points.

Burger : Delicious (albeit quite cheesy)
Salad: Wedge salad good to share!
Brussel sprouts: Fried with bacon (huge pile that 2 people had trouble finishing)
Drinks: Excellent 



Staff were all enthusiastic about the food and making sure everyone had an awesome experience. Recommended not over ordering (which was very appreciated). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  

Food wise we had:
Cheddar potato bread and browned butter - 5/5 - a real delight. So flavourful and hearty.  I really want the bread recipe.

The burrata - 5/5 stand out dish. So soft and creamy with a good citrus accompaniment 

Pork - 2.5/5 it was really forgettable. Soft and well cooked just kind of got lost in its sauce.  It was recommended by the waitress but I wish we'd tried something else

Aloette fries- 3.5/5 - a bit of an odd dish it was like fries with melted nacho cheese on. The fries were salted and cooked well it's just weird to have gross hangover food in a fancy place.  It got a bit soggy and we couldn't finish

Mac and cheese- 4/5 really nice and creamy. Very heavy but not super special. Just a really good classic

Brussels - 4/5 again really good but nothing super special that you can't get elsewhere in the city 

Squash and pecans - 3/5 - super sweet like granola. You could have made this into a breakfast. It was good though just share it if you get it so you don't get sick from the sugar rush

Other ratings:
Cocktails: 3.5/5 -over priced but well put together with quality ingredients 

Juices: 3/5 - fresh and locally sourced from greenhouse but $9 for a juice is insane

Staff: 3/5. Door staff had a slight air of pretentiousness.  Wait staff were personable but over attentive. Plates were cleared one by one as soon as they became empty and the bill was brought before asking.  

Washroom taps: 5/5 The decor is nice but those washroom taps are real special. 

Overall it was 3/5. There's nothing super special here apart from the bread and burrata. I would eat a whole loaf of that bread, man.  Anyway- don't believe the hype. Go here if it's early and you're passing and there's space.  Don't queue-it's too cold"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends bday. I went during the Aloette hour and would definitely recommend trying some of the drinks. I enjoyed the peach one.

In terms of food, only the Butternut squash and Uni on Toast were memorable. The other foods I ordered foie gras, tuna on crisps, and Aloette burger were above average in taste but nothing I would try again. My friend enjoyed their fries and I think they do fry things there fairly well including their cheese toast.

I cannot emphasize how much you need to try their brown butter butternut squash. It is almost to die for! It's sumptuous and aromatic and the texture is so beautifully contrasted with the pumpkin seeds. I would just go back for this one dish.

4 stars bc only a couple items were standout. The servers were lovely, but it's not a 5 bc I expected more from the food."}
{"text":"Loved the himachi sushi. Wine was yummy The burger was good but the fries were over salted and the mayo dip was not appetizing. And an abundance of Mayo overpowered the Katso chicken and tempura beans. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing food with equally fantastic service. Beautifully decorated space. 4 apps for 2 people was more than enough as the portions were surprisingly generous."}
{"text":"I loved Alo so I was really excited when its casual sister restaurant, Aloette, opened up.  The restaurant does not take reservations.  Unfortunately I had to take a star off for the cold that we had to endure as we were seated right across the main door, which they kept opening and closing as guests entered/left.  Maybe add some curtain to that door to block out the ridiculously cold air if they must have seats there?

We ordered the mac & cheese to share, it might've been one of the best I've had.  My fiance ordered the Aloette burger and fries, which we had to send back to the kitchen as the patty was pretty much raw.  Second star off.  The roasted pork belly that I had was tender and juicy.  So overall I have some mixed feelings about Aloette.  Would I go again?  Maybe, but not if there's a long line-up. Or better yet, try my luck and make a reservation at Alo instead."}
{"text":"Amazing service, excellent food.  Even the free offer of bread with whipped yeast-butter adds a twist (the taste reminds me a bit of miso).  The plump, garlicky Burgundy Snails made a great segue-way to the beef tartare, which had the perfect texture of being neither too chunky nor too minced. Ribeye steak was tender, perfectly seared, and oh-so-tasty."}
{"text":"First time patron.  Trendy diner, and cool atmosphere. Food was ok, at best. We ordered 6 dishes and none of them were very impressive.  Flavours were too strong and bold for our liking.  The cod, was especially strong and left an after taste we couldn't lose...not even after eating the lemon meringue pie...which was not very good either. Anyway, nice atmosphere, but overpriced and under whelming."}
{"text":"This spot is cozy and the food is on the mark! We've been to Alo and wanted to check out Chef Kriss' new diner. We went during the first week they opened and didn't have to wait for a table at 5:15pm. Been back another time and it was only a 5-10 min wait. 

It's a great casual spot - the menu is limited but changes every now and then. I had the braised lamb couscous and loved it! Great flavours that blend really well together with sliced radish and oranges mixed in. The poutine is average but then again, I've never had great poutine in Toronto. 
The service is perfect and drink offerings are abundant. I love having different wines that the sommelier of a reputable restaurant selects and this place offers exactly that."}
{"text":"The ambience was great, customer service was impeccable and the food tasted amazing! I'm pretty sure everyone who worked at the restaurant made conversation with us and made us feel welcome. Bill came out to just above $80 before tip, with one cocktail. 

We ordered the clams, beef tartare, burger (changed to aloette fries) and broccoli for two, and we didn't even come close to finishing everything. I would recommend everything we ordered except maybe the Aloette fries - I definitely feel like that was overhyped by reviews. The only caveat I would make about the food (and this would be based on personal preference) was that everything was TOO filling/heavy.

The only (expected) downside of eating here? It took around 45 minutes for us to get a table for two on a Tuesday night, so I can only imagine the wait time on a Friday or Saturday night.."}
{"text":"The ultimate trifecta...great environment, amazing service and creative dishes that cannot be beat. 

The beef short rib is so tender that it melts off the bone; however served with shishito peppers, chimichurri, shallot, and watercress brings this dish to another level that will leave you wanting more. 

Pairs perfectly with a glass of Pearl Morissette Chardonnay.

This is the place to be if you want classic contemporary diner food with an 'Alo' twist."}
{"text":"I haven't been this excited for food in so long. Every dish ordered had me mmm-ing and oooh-ing and omg-ing after first bite! It would be hard to chose my favourite menu item since all plates were absolutely delicious and perfectly put together, each with their own special flavour and texture and all that yummy goodness. I would have to say though that the ribeye steak completely blew my mind and I'm getting all warm and fuzzy feels thinking about it today. Bone marrow butter - that's all that needs to be said. The chef knows what he's doing when even the iceberg wedge wows you. I would never order it, let alone write about salad in a review but it pleasantly surprised me with its combination of chive cream, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and parmesan cheese. The result is you can't go wrong with anything you order.

The design is stunning - Reminds of an olden day fancied up cable car. The customer service is top notch - everyone works together to make this dining experience a memorable one that will want you coming back for more... and I will most definitely be coming back for more!

Just some tips: make a reservation since the wait list can get filled up; parties can't be bigger than 4 people; even if you're full, get the dessert!"}
{"text":"Was here last weekend for lunch. The scallop tostada was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Beautiful decor. Lots of windows for lovely natural lighting to showcase the dishes. 

First of all, the complimentary bread is A M A Z I N G. The menu is small and only a handful of dishes are \"mains\" but really, the mains weren't significantly bigger.

The octopus dish ($28): outstanding. I have never been a fan of octopus but I have been converted. It was so soft and tender. The pork belly that came with it was a nice thick slab, crispy and fatty. There was a nice cauliflower puree, but no bread/carb to mix it with. It was a very heavy dish.

Crispy squash ($12): hearty. Loved the crispy pumpkin seeds. A nice dish to share, but also very heavy.

Scallop tostada ($14): juicy scallops and refreshing. Definitely messy to eat (impossible to try to fit into your mouth in one bite). Lots of cilantro on top so cilantro haters beware. 

Would highly recommend getting at least one seafood dish (i.e. scallop tostada, hamachi sashimi) as they are more refreshing and lighter to cut the heaviness of the meat dishes. 

I like how the menu is constantly updated. Sad that the beef tartare is no longer offered, but what we had was wonderful."}
{"text":"Highlights of the meal: 
1. Complimentary cheese bread with yeast butter
2. Roasted pineapple sundae
3. Fries"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Aloette 5 stars because I absolutely love love love Alo. But alas it wasn't quite so but still a great restaurant. 

Went on a wintery day for lunch and got there 20 mins after it opened. I was solo dining so got seated at the bar and the place quickly filled up. I ordered the burger, which comes with fries and the chocolate shake.

The fries were just a touch under salted, really just a touch. It comes with a dipping sauce which I found underwhelming. The burger is classically dressed and perfectly cooked but wasn't mind blowing - Richmond Station has a much much better burger.

The chocolate shake - now this isn't your super triple thick chocolate shake. More maltey than anything - very good and light. 

the STAR of the show is their complimentary cheese bread. Like hands down, bar none, delicious. Delicious! maybe thats why I was so underwhelmed by everything else because the thing they give out for FREE was better than anything I paid $$ for!

The service is impeccable! your water glass will never be less than 90% full. 

i will be back. For the cheese bread."}
{"text":"Aloette is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Toronto right now. I have been to Alo (located upstairs, owned by the same chef Patrick Kriss) and while I enjoyed the tasting menu there, the experience was a bit too intimate and the service a bit too attentive for me! In my opinion, Aloette offers equally delicious food and equally stellar service in a much more relaxed environment.

They don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve for everyone. I came with my fiance on a Wednesday night around 6PM and we were lucky to get two seats at the bar right away. The place quickly filled up within the next 15-20 minutes! We got a gin and tonic and one of the cocktails, the balsam spritz. They give everyone cheesy bread with whipped yeast butter on the house to start. This was soo good! Definitely top 2 best breads I've ever had. For food, we shared the charred chorizo, burgundy snails, and the aloette burger. The chorizo and snails were such unique and flavourful dishes - I would suggest giving both of these a try. The burger was a bit more generic (although it did come with fried cheese) but it was still tasty. It came with a very generous portion of fries which tasted okay - we usually don't leave any fries behind but we were so full that we couldn't finish the whole plate even between the two of us.

Highly, highly recommend. I can't wait to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Welcomed at the door by a very friendly employee. We look at the space; 3 booths open, the fourth occupied by the elderly couple we let go in front of us (out of courtesy, we were at the door sooner).

Server seats us at the bar. We ask if we can take one of the three booths (all have couples in them and so are we). They tell us to wait and come back with who I assume is a manager. She explains to us that there is a maximum number of booths that can have couples and that the rest of the booths are (sort of) reserved for larger parties. I kind of get the feeling that I'm being judged by the sort of customer I'll be (I don't dress business casual. I'm fairly h&m casual and uninteresting, but clean of course). I start giving a bit of attitude but my other half reminds me that this is our first \"date\" in a while (toddler life). I agree and let it go. I will end up regretting that attitude I gave the manager, here is why;

First off, the place is very small, true, but still feels airy. We are seated at the very end of the bar and it is actually fairly comfortable (Although being in the industry, I do feel that these two seats are badly placed since it's too close to the kitchen action).

We are greeted by our server. She's extremely friendly. It is a perfectly sized menu so we quickly get under way;

Oysters to start; not the best ones I've had. It doesn't come with the traditional mignonette but there is a salsa.
Beef tartare; generally a big fan of the traditional with the quail egg. This one has some warm crispy bits. I criticised it at first but as I dug deeper, sort of fell in love with it. Beware, it's a fairly large appetizer portion. 
On the side, they offer their homemade cheese bread. I'm not a huge fan of cheese bread but the texture of the bread is extraordinary!
Our mains are the salmon and the steak. 
Salmon has an amazing mustard sauce on top, wife loves it so much, she has to order a side of it, and it is truly amazing. 
Steak is very very simple; with shiitake mushrooms on top. No fries, no half-made salad, nothing else. Just the amazing steak and the mushrooms. I'm completely against wasted garnish and find this amazingly beautiful.
We each started with a glass of chardonnay. I ordered a second. Just as we were nearing the end of our date, the manager came by and topped us off to thank us for our understanding. Now this is managerial beauty!!! You madame, know what you're doing!
We leave extremely happy and of course will return."}
{"text":"This was a planned trip with Yelp Eating Buddies (YEB) one of the trio had tried this spot before so recommended we go for an early dinner as the waits can be taxing. So on a bitter cold afternoon at an odd time for dinner the place was packed to the brim and we grabbed the last table. I guess the popularity/rave reviews of Alo has trickled down to this spot literally :) 
The beer list is OK while the cocktails/wine list seemed decent. 
After going through the menu we decided on the following
Beef Tartar: Decent at this price point and. Spiced well
Aloette Burger. Ho Hum IMO as the cheese was so salty I could barely taste anything after few bites. Side of fries was good
Cornish Hen: Decent again. I am a fan of oyster mushrooms and I think they elevated this dish.
Desserts we ordered both
Lemon Meringue Pie: Very good IMO. The lemon curd had the right amount of tang which is mostly amiss at other locations/stores. Meringue on top was good as well.
Apple Pie Sundae. A deconstructed version of apple pie à la mode. OK though beware this will be very hard to share.
Decent price point for a bistro so 3.5 stars all said and done though I think will return to try brunch at the very least."}
{"text":"First day!  Grand opening!  Hooray!

No kinks to iron out.  Just like Alo, service was amazing. Excellent, personable staff. Incomparable for a casual restaurant.  

We tried 3 appetizers: hamachi, tartare with fries, and clams.  We had 3 drinks.  They were all good.  

Keep in mind, this isn't upstairs.  It's definitely way more accessible to the masses. Prices are very reasonable for a casual night out.  Also, they take no reservations!  First come, first served. 

I want to say we really appreciated the fact that Chef Kriss made his rounds and personally greeted his patrons.  He thanked us for coming on this first day.  We didn't feel like customers, we felt like guests.  It was that added touch of humble gratitude that makes me a true, dedicated fan.

We will definitely be back to try the mains!"}
{"text":"Thank you Chef @patrickkriss for such an AMAZING dining experience. Every single dish was absolutely phenomenal! I ordered the Scallop Sashimi and Ribeye steak. You can tell from the very first might that the scallop was fresh. The steak was perfectly cook - tender, flavourful, buttery... I am salivating just thinking about it. The butternut squash since was on the house on behalf of the Chefs (thank you Chef Kriss!) but if you see it in the menu it is a MUST-TRY! It balanced out the steak so well and the hollandaise sauce was so rich and creamy. The vibe was great and I had a wonderful view of the action happening in the kitchen. I haven't had a meal like this in a while by I must say... Aloette is now one of my favourite restaurants here in Toronto."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a top-rate experience at Aloette from start to finish. We started with a ~30 minute wait, which was just enough time to have a drink upstairs at Alo (Old Fashioned was an ~8/10 effort). 

Downstairs, the service was impeccable and menu was inventive but substantial. We had a range of seafood offerings (soft shell crab, tuna, octopus) and a number of savory delights (cheese plate and fritters). The food was full of complex flavors that kept us wanting more. There was a nice, but focused wine and cocktail list to match the occasion. 

It was one of the best meals we have had during our 7 years in Toronto and rates ahead of several of the high-end tasting menus in the city. We will certainly be back, and you should go!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Aloette and I'm ridiculously happy and basking in latent food-gasm glow. We sat at the bar and had one of the most fun and well executed dinners we've had in ages. The chorizo was a varied plate with peppers, confit garlic, rice crackers and LOVE . The thoughtful presentation and harmony of flavours put this dish above and beyond what other restaurants are doing for small plates.
The bread with whipped brown butter was absolute heaven. I generally don't eat bread, but this is something special!
Clams Casino seem like they would be a kitschy throwback, but instead are satisfying and inspired.

Aloette Fries will put any poutine to shame.

Finally, the lovely snails... nestled in baby greens with pork belly and king oyster mushrooms--they were joyous! Excellent with a glass of the Greek varietal that is offered for $10/glass. Ridiculous pairing!

The wine list is playful and impressive with several less known varietals for decent prices.

Charmed and Overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I pass by this place everyday and see it gradually getting busy everyday and wonder if the food is as cool as the decor. Very New York diner vibe. Didn't come with huge expectations, however food really made me super happy! The chicken is very flavourful and crispy.
It gets really busy after 630."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 4. Put our name on the list at 6pm, went close by for a couple drinks, and were seated by 7:15pm. The service here is outstanding. The cocktails were perfect. The potato and cheddar bread and yeast butter was the best thing I've eaten all year. And everything else that we ordered was outstanding as well. For the service, experience, cocktails, and food - Aloette is a must visit."}
{"text":"We arrived at Aloette around 4:20pm on a Saturday (restaurant opens at 4:30pm) and there was already a line, but fortunately, we were able to grab seats at the bar. We tried their clams, steak tartare, burger, and Brussels sprouts. The burger is probably the most popular item on the menu, so I had high expectations. While the burger was cooked perfectly, I did find it came with too much sauce. Everything else was delicious, but my favourite item of the night has got to be the complimentary bread - their cheesy potato bread with yeast butter was absolutely divine. Service, like Alo's, was fantastic. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The dishes at Aloette are more casual, but just as delicious as the food we had at Alo upstairs. Eating dinner at the bar can be squishy and uncomfortable, but you take whatever seat you can get. We waited 30 minutes on a Tuesday night (the weekend wait times can go up to 2 hours). 

The service is excellent. The staff were helpful with describing menu selections and very attentive - I never had to ask for a water refill. The kitchen was flexible with food requests. 

Although the food is good, I expected it to be better. I will definitely return but I'm not raving about it to everyone around me.

asparagus - 5/5

stracciatella cheese - 4/5

roasted octopus - 3/5

aloette burger - 4/5 (the fries were excellent)"}
{"text":"Decadence at its best! Went on opening night and then again with a friend on a cold night - the staff, food and overall atmosphere are warm and inviting.  

The rib eye is out if this world  - also the complimentary bread and butter are to die for!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time. Got there right at opening and there was already a little line up. Gorgeous interior with the vintage dinner feel. Knowledgeable staff. Was REALLY looking forward to their uni toast (that's what I came here for!) but disappointed to find out that their shipment hadn't arrived yet that day. I suppose, on the bright side, that reflects how fresh their seafood orders are.. ordered their gnocchi and got a taste of their Aloette burger. Both were well executed. Will have to come back again for their uni toast one day.. hopefully they'll have supplies in stock by then."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous. We shared the salmon sashimi with avocado (so good), beef carpaccio and the asparagus dish. My husband also ordered the burger (which ended up being too much food for 2) but the burger was the best I've ever tasted. The staff were friendly and attentive. It was a little dark inside but comfortable."}
{"text":"Walk in only restaurant however very organized setup! Came in on a THurs evening w/ a girlfriend at around 6pm & put out names on the waitlist. Got an immediate txt saying im on the waitlist - in a matter of 30mins i got a txt saying my table was rdy. The balsam spritz was really refreshing & the foam was a creamy orange float - so delicious!! The bread and yeast butter was soooo good - i kept the butter spread for the remainder of the meals. Got the rib eye as my main - med to medium rare and it was tender and juicy! Dessert we got the apple pie sundae and the crumble was what stood out the most - definatelty a dessert to share! Overall great experience w/ great staff. I dropped my napkin on the floor & the staff noticed and picked it up without me knowing and handed me a new one - that is what you call great cx service (:"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better- the good food keeps flowing from the bread to beautiful burger and everything in between. The wedge salad is definitely one of the highlights and must haves here so is the squash and long beans tempura."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit Aloette again this past weekend, and the experience was all around perfect. We had the oysters, sashimi appetizer, mac and cheese, and salmon dishes. The hamachi sashimi was deliciously with a delicate sweet and spicy kick. Next time, I may just order two of these as a main. The mac and cheese, served in a cast iron skillet may have been the cheesiest mac and cheese we've ever had (perfect for cheese lovers like us). And, the salmon filet was perfectly cooked and had a great crust on the skin. We will definitely be back for more Aloette."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I came here around 3:30pm on a Friday and the restaurant was packed. No line up but we got the last two seats at the bar. 

We ordered a tuna dish, a iceberg lettuce, a short rib, a chicken katsu and a lemon meringue pie. There's some hit or miss. I think compared to other diner food or bar food, you can definitely tell they are throwing a fine twist, presentation, materials, sources, and also price tags (lol) probably because of its upscale sister restaurant upstairs. 

I was really impressed by the iceberg lettuce and the short rib, especially the rib. My friend and I stopped talking when we were eating it! The tuna dish and chicken katsu are so so. The lemon meringue pie was disappointing. Other than the short ribs, the highlights of the meal was definitely the bread and butter on the house. I think it has surpassed the previous and current on house bread at Alo! You must have it!"}
{"text":"It's tough to get a table at this busy place. 

But it's totally worth the effort. 

The place has decor like it's food. So many interesting, classy, quality choices and small details everywhere. The food here feels like real art, and the restaurant almost feels like a tiny museum(the bar table top is made of leather i think!).

Worth the price of admission for this unique culinary experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant is stunning, every detail has been thought out. There's even a nook in the middle of the two booths to fit the water carafe.

The food is decadent, and delicious! I would recommend the beef tartare, and the hamachi appetizer has a curry-like sauce. For entree, the burger is top notch, and the pork is super flavourful and a bit on the greasy side so sharing is recommended. 

Here is where the one star is missing. The service is attentive but if anything, a little too much. The waiters would come and get things from you while in the middle of the conversation. The table was dirty when I sat down, and we were not given napkin until asked. 

Regardless, I still had a great time, and would come again! Thank you for the delicious house made cheese sourdough and yeast butter."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere. Music is grea, there is a hang out atmosphere to the place but with incredibly attentive service and beautiful decor. It is a bit dark inside. I had the burger which was absolutely amazing...everything you would ever want in a burger. The appetizer sashimi was incredibly fresh and delicate.  Our second appetizer was smelts - crisp, delicious but heavy. We also had brussel sprouts which were very tasty but very fatty as well. When we go back I will try more of the appetizers to keep things lighter. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Aloette is the casual but elegant sister restaurant to Alo (the more formal fine dining restaurant). Aloette is designed as a chic upscale diner. The decor and uniform of the servers invoke a contemporary play on a 50's diner. There's also a bit of a steampuck feel to the place.  
Not unlike Alo, Aloette is extremely busy. They do not take reservations. It is first come first serve. Plan accordingly. 

The service is attentive and professional. It is the hospitality that I have come to expect from Alo (and now Aloette). The servers and bartenders are friendly and professional without being too stuffy.

To start, I had a Bramble Shake which was essentially an alcoholic milkshake made with tanqueray rangpur gin, raspberry and coconut. It was delicious. 

The food was excellent. I ordered the Burgundy Snails and Cornish Hen. Both dishes were fresh, flavourful and innovative. These dishes were fresh renditions of the French classics - the dishes actually exceeded my expectations. The little fried egg on top of the cornish hen was inspired.

For dessert, I ordered the apple pie sundae with layers of warm caramel sauce, apple pie filling and crumble and ice cream. This was a great way to end the meal. 

I would highly recommend Aloette. I will be back to try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Just no. 
How you f**k up fois and urchin is beyond me.
The restaurant is all about buttered bread. Every dish is over taken by the power of caramelized bread with butter. Good bread and great butter but enough already! 
This can be lovely and decadent but with ingredients that command their own fatty creamy nature be the star of the show, the dishes fall drastically short .
There is an abundance of fois offered in the terrain however with the salty pork mixed in and the over abundance of salty peanuts as a crust and then the butter crusted bread I'm left asking why can't I taste the fois with so much of it? 
I am by no means a purist but with this dish I'm starting to see the appeal. With a sauce of cherries and grapes that's not quite sweet enough to embrace the endless flavors of layered fat and salt I'm left to say this dish is a hot mess!!!
Moving on to the uni. For 22$ you are getting a tun. But a tun of what? Tastes like BOSTON to me. Not much nutty ness. The mild flavour is over taken by again the endless supply of buttered toasted bread. A smear of some kind over powered by (you guessed it) more butter. 
Will it ever end? 
Thank god for the hamachi!
A flavourful dish slightly over taken by strong flavours of curry but it's freshness is welcome after the endless supply of heavy gut wrenching food first served. This is in the verge of something to write home about. 
Plates are beautiful and menu enticing but I expect much more from the baby sister of ALO ... it reminds me more of mediocre French bistro with a few hits and some big misses."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious.  The comp toast they provide at the beginning is soo soft and cheesy yet crispy on the outside. Even the butter is special.   

The burger is the best burger in the city. And so are the French fries.  If you like crispy fires"}
{"text":"Nothing too spectacular . Tried and not memorable. I had the burger - not moist and just ok . Brussel sprouts as side , it was good but other restaurants can make the same . So if you are hungry and can get a table , try it but dont expect a mind blowing experience."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about worth the wait.. Fantastic service, delicious food, and great music.  They take down your name, and although you'll likely have to wait a half hour, they text you when the table is ready.  It gives you time to look around the area, without wasting time in line. I highly recommend the lemon meringue dessert to top off the night!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high given all the raving reviews I'd seen for this place and I was a bit disappointed when I had the chance to try it out. It's walk-in only, so expect to wait for a table especially if you're coming on a weekend. The restaurant is quite small, so if you're sitting at the bar, expect to be elbow to elbow with your neighbour. 

The food was quite average. I tried the Aloette burger, which was very rich and overall a decent burger. The fries were probably the highlight of the dish. 

The one redeeming point was the A+ service. Especially if you're seated at the bar, you can expect to served quite quickly. 

I don't see myself coming back here because I think there are much better options available in the city at the same price point. So save your time and money for somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little difficult to rate. To start the place is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and attentive. So, my initial impression was very positive. 

I ordered a glass of white wine ($10) and I found the pour too small. After couple of sips I had to start saving it. For appetizer I ordered hamachi sashimi ($18). It was disappointing. It was served on round taco style flat bread. To me, the enjoyment of sashimi comes from tasting the subtle flavours of fish and feeling the texture in my mouth. The hard taco made this impossible. Also, the amount of fish was so tiny I did not feel it or taste it at any point. It made me think of Mexican food, really.

For main I ordered the organic salmon ($23). It does not come with anything other than few tiny greens sprinkled on top of it. I was expecting perhaps veggies or rice or something else to make it filling enough to qualify as a main. The fish was actually very delicious and my favourite part of the meal. I personally like uncooked fish, but others may not appreciate that most of the salmon was completely raw inside.

The meal cost almost $60 before tips and honestly I don't feel the meal was worth it."}
{"text":"My head exploded from how amazing it was.

Oysters, clams casino, some salad, ribeye steak (good lord) and the fries. All 10/10. I came late and only had to wait 20min for a table. This place is one of the best restaurants in the city. Dying to go back."}

Wow, just wow. My day went from having one of the worst meals in my life to one of the best I've had in a long time.

I started off with the king cup highball. It was a lot lighter than I expected. The addition of the laphroaig quarter cask into this is phenomenal. The peatiness really gives this drink a nice finish. An amazing combination to be sure. 

When they brought the bread, OMG I started to drool... The bread was a cheddar-infused and came with a side of yeast butter. It was phenomenal. The bread itself was delicious, but the addition of butter was like an explosion of flavour.

We ended up getting 2 appetizers and 2 mains to share: 
Appetizers: 
Scallop tostada
Foie gras terrine

Mains:
Grilled octopus
Beef short rib

The scallop in the tostadas were slightly sweet and fit amazingly with the hint of tartness the granny smith apple. The heat from the jalapeño was just enough to give it a nice little kick. 

The foie gras terrine was coated with a crunchy layer of hazelnuts (not 100% sure) that just balanced out the butteriness of the foie gras without compromising any of the richness. 

The grilled octopus itself was cooked to perfection, not overly chewy from undercooking, yet not crumbly from overcooking. However, the flavour from the black beans was a little too salty for me and took away from the flavours of the other components. 

The beef short ribs though was not only cooked to perfection (where the bone still has a little resistance to the meat when you pull on it), but it was like a flavour explosion in my mouth. So good!

Of course no meal would be complete without dessert, and we ended up getting the black forest sundae. The cake inside was warm and light, and the chocolate sauce was rich and toasted (almost like it was brûléed, maybe it was).

The portions were decent and I left comfortably full. The cost was also very reasonable. That being said, if you're looking to stuff yourself, you came to the wrong place to eat.

The design and decor of this restaurant is so meticulous, every space is functional and aesthetically pleasing. It reminds me of a bistro in Paris and the cabin of a 1950s yacht. The roof looked so comfortable I wanted to sit on it... hahaha... The choice of music was definitely a little strange (late 90s-mid 00s rap/hip hop) but really the only thing I could think of that I didn't like about the ambience. 

The service here was very attentive and courteous. They have a coat check out front, and have purse hangers for you to use. The staff always kept my table clean and my water full. The dishes were cleaned of dust 3 times before it even came to my table. 

A great restaurant (easily top 10 in the city), Chef Betsch did a phenomenal job with the food. And the bartending staff did an equally impressive job with the cocktails. Overall, amazing food and equally impressive service all for a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! This was my first time at Aloette and I was blown away. Their service and especially their food was exceptional. We were lucky to get there and get a booth at 5:30pm because they don't take reservations and there's only 24 seats in the restaurant. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Aloette Burger with Aloette fries. One of the best burgers I've ever had! The pickle relish/mayo still makes my mouth water. Prices are very reasonable for a gourmet burger. Will be coming back here regularly to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"How could I not try this place? It looks cool, very New York like. Staff are great, polished place from the food to the atmosphere. Nicely done: fresh, sophisticated tastes."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleagues for lunch. Expect a waiting line if you're a party of 4 for about 20 mins (during work lunch hour). 

The staff were super friendly, and it didn't take the food that long to prepare the food. 

The dishes we got were extremely delicious! I'm only giving this a 4 star because despite ordering appetizers along with our main course we still left hungry. All in all each paid ~$40 each."}
{"text":"My group of friends and I went to this restaurant with high expectations. The service was well done with complimentary coat check. Our table had four people and we ordered the special roasted pork with foie gras, cornish hen, organic salmon, scallop tostada, beef tartare, fried smelts, a bottle of cava, aperol spritz and \"the fresh number\" cocktail. 

We started our night on a high note with the aperol spritz (not on the menu but you can order it) and \"the fresh number\" cocktail. \"The fresh number\" was not as good and was watered down. We followed with the starters which included scallop tostada, beef tartare and fried smelts. Our waitress helped us with this selection but we found them not as good as she described. The scallop tostadas come in a set of 3 and was pretty saucy. The beef tartare was also loaded with sauce so it tasted more like a burger with big mac sauce. And the fried smelts were pretty well seasoned and were topped with deep fried jalapeño pieces. 

For our mains, two of us shared the special, which was the foie gras roasted pork (a favourite of our waitress). The pork chop was a fairly large piece and is shareable but it was greasy and fatty. There were no sides to accompany this dish. The organic salmon which was cooked well but not mind blowing in any way. And the cornish hen which was also fairly greasy and heavy and it was accompanied by mushrooms, spinach and a fried egg.  

We ended our meal with a bottle of cava which was a nice way to end the night. 

From what we ordered the best dishes included the scallop tostada, fried smelts and the cornish hen. 

Our bill came out to around ~300, which we felt was a bit pricey for the quality of the food we ate. It was definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"One of our best meals. First, the starter bread is delicious - my idea of heaven would involve floating through clouds of this stuff and eating it all day long. 

We shared the crispy squash, beet salad and the steak. Everything was flavourful and cooked perfectly. Steak was top decile. 

Although we were full, we decided to spring for dessert - the sundae. I had pretty average expectations because it's just a sundae, but even that was insanely good. 

The servers were attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  

For about $100 with drinks, you seriously cannot go wrong with this place. We liked it more than Alo. We waited just over an hour on a Thursday at 6:30pm, but it was well worth it. 

Go, and tell that bread I say hi."}
{"text":"I'll try one more time but the frites were so over-salted and greasy I couldn'tj gg  finish them and felt nauseous all afternoon.vvyjvg gygy ty???"}
{"text":"Great space - cozy and with a nice ambience. The reception was prompt and efficient. We didn't need to wait long to be seated and the server was quick to take our orders. The food was very tasty - you can tell it is well thought of - the ingredients are fresh and have a good combo of textures that add depth to the taste. Of the things I tasted I liked the burger and the chicken katsu the most."}
{"text":"Considering Alo is at the heart of this places origins - It's super difficult to not have high expectations for this place.

All I can say is, go.

It's still a busy spot but go after the lunch hour and you'll be just fine.

It's a beautiful, luxurious feeling diner.  Loved the design and details. 

That being said the customer service here is equal to the architectural eye candy.  Any questions or dietary questions they are more than happy to help with.

I had the signature burger and fries which came with more free carbs.  (I included a photo of it. Fresh and made in house).

A good burger has that sign - grease all over your hands. Holy crap. Totally messy.  Definitely not a low fat meal. Juicy, flavourful and rich.  Fries were equally as good but crispy. 

On the upscale end it's hard to beat for quality and experience. 

The menu Does change but I can imagine the burger would remain. From all reviews the pork is probably the next on my list.

If you're in the downtown spadina core and have time - add it to your list."}
{"text":"Great Location as it's right at Queen and Spadina. VERY SMALL so make sure you get there early. 

We started off with complimentary cheese toast and butter. Absolutely delicious, wasn't too intense, and it was very comforting. 

We ordered the aloette burger (5 stars) had melted beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce and pickles. The quality of the meat was outstanding and I liked that the bun had a crunch to it. 

We opted for the Aloette fries which has melted smoked gouda, hot sauce and jus - fries were perfection, I would say the hot sauce has an interesting flavor but it wasn't spicy for me. 

Also ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side. Not bad, not my favorite as it wasn't cheesy and I wish they used smaller noodles. 

overall this was A-Ok! I would come back if I was in the area. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I am starting this review long before my food arrives for a very simple reason. Service. Aloette had an hour and a half wait. No reservations. 

It was 8:45 and I was tired and needed a drink. You can't wait at their bar because it is part of their seating. The maître d' called upstairs to Alo and arranged a \"window seat\" for me at the bar. This is literally sitting on the window sill which is comfortably arranged with pillows and a candle. 

Originally, I had to approach the bar after a long wait to be welcomed. The bartender apologized and took my order. Eventually I was invited to take a seat at the bar and offered a dinner menu. I decided to wait for my Alloette reservation. 

When my text came and I went back downstairs, the maître d' was again tremendously gracious and accommodating. He offered me a seating choice (table or bar counter), took my drink order, asked if I had any menu questions and just generally made me feel welcome. 

I ordered their famous burger and was not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly (they don't ask how you want it cooked) with a large slice of beaufort cheese caramelized on top. Beaufort is a firm, raw cow's milk cheese associated with the gruyère family. I was very happy I had waited and not eaten upstairs as this burger was the best I have ever had!

So, although the wait associated with no reservations makes eating at Aloette challenging, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Aloette is where it's at!
Whether seated at the bar or at one of their swanky booths, you're sure to enjoy a feast for the senses. This second establishment created by Chef Patrick Kriss and Chef Matthew Betsch, brings diner classics to a whole new level! The only setback is that the apps are so good, you may want to opt for a selection of apps over a main course. Or come hungry and follow appetizers with one of their soon to be famous entrees. It will be hard to choose, so don't even try. Just know you'll be back to try the others...I know I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.
The same savoir-faire as Alo on all counts: creativity, high quality ingredients, mesmerizing (and dangerously awesome) cocktails and service but in a simpler, more low-key setting.

I have been twice in about 2 months and tried about 2 thirds of the menu (we are the sharing type) - every item I tried provided an exciting (and addictive) experience... if only the wait time wasn't an hour long or if we could make reservations it would then be a 6 out of 5.
Did I mention I love this place?"}
{"text":"I have yet to actually try the well known Alo restaurant ( I really should start using my gift certificate soon lol), but since I was downtown for an appointment and one of my friends raved about this restaurant, I decided to try it for lunch with two other friends (one who's been there before once), and another friend who is also trying this place out for the first time.

My friend told me that the last few days he walked by there wasn't much wait time.. so of course the actual day where we ended up going, there was a bit of a wait lol. Which was not too bad, about 20 mins, right at 12:30pm lunch rush. So we left them our contact and off we went to do some walking and shopping and they texted us when the table was ready. This restaurant does not do any reservations - walk-ins only.

This restaurant replaced the old nail salon that used to be under the Alo restaurant, so I think it's a clever move on their part to convert the bottom level to a fining dining with a bit of a bar/rustic look and with price points that are more affordable than the Alo. Of course, for the average person grabbing lunch, this is certainly not the cheapest meal, but definitely one of the best :)

We ended up ordering 1 appetizer, 3 entrees and a dessert. So let me break down each dish for you:
First off... their complimentary bread with the burnt butter... holy jeez it was amazing and to die for! I'm still thinking about it as I'm writing it... I almost wanted to ask for more!

beef tartare - portion was quite good for its price, the beef is minced but not too grounded up - perfect to spread on the lettuce wraps that it comes with for a bit of crunch. delicious! the beef was very well seasoned and I loved the crunch from the lettuce. Each of us were able to have about 2-3 pieces of this assembly.

cornish hen - portions again, quite substantial. It doesn't really come with much sides, aside from a mix of olives and peppers at the bottom. I normally don't eat olives, but this... this I will devour :) the garnishes complements the hen very well, and definitely one of the most soft and moist chicken I've had in a while!

Salmon - portions were good and the salmon was moist but firm as well - perfect texture, and not overcooked. The garnishes and sauce that came with it was quite nice! I liked the crunch from the microgreens and the sauce was delicious!

Macaroni and cheese - this... wow. it's super filling - the portion isn't very large, but it's definitely very rich. I liked how it's baked on a cast iron mini skillet so there's a bit of a crust on the pasta as well. it comes with a spicy tomato/ketchup sauce and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well they go together and the heat is just a notch, perfect for the taste without overpowering the mac and cheese itself.
 
Aloette fries - for those who like poutine... you will definitely like their take on the fries. Sausage gravy and cheese - it was amazing. The amount you get is quite good for its price (i'ts a side that we ordered separately because the add on fries with the beef tartar doesn't have the fixings), and we were already pretty stuffed after eating these four dishes that we actually had some trouble finishing!

Since we were so full... we decided to share a pc of lemon meringue pie. It was amazing! If i had more time i woudl've gotten coffee to enjoy with it. the lemon tartness is quite present, and balancing out the sweetness of the pie itself. The top is torched marshmellows... quite a delightful pairing and between the 3 of us, the pie is quite sizeable, and we coudln't finish because we were THAT full. 

On top of that, they changed our dishes and cutlery between courses. Service is definitely wonderful.

Their menu selection is not very large.. so every item we ordered off the menu was spot on perfect, which is expected of a restaurant when they cater only to a handful of dishes. But I will say this: Price point - yes it's about 35 per person plus tip... but definitely an amazing meal and I was quite satisfied :) Order anything on their menu and I don't think you will be disappointed. I would definitely recommend trying if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Given the almost unanimous raves for Aloette, I knew it was just a matter of time before I was sitting within its cramped confines.

We arrived around noon on a Friday and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. Fortunately, they've got a system where they text when the table is almost ready, so we killed some time at a nearby Dollarama.

We came back and were seated at the bar and placed our order almost immediately, and yet it took almost a full half hour for the food to show up. Busy kitchen, I guess.

I knew walking in I had to order the Aloette Burger & Fries (\"beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce, pickle\") and it was absolutely as good as advertised. All the components worked brilliantly together and that melty beaufort cheese provides an irresistible zing.

(My one issue with the otherwise superlative burger was the meat itself, which was cooked closer to well done than medium rare. The patty was, as a result, not nearly as juicy as it could/should have been, unfortunately.)

Shout-out to the fries, too, and the incredible aioli that's provided. We were also given a complementary appetizer of cheesy toast and yeast butter, and indeed they were both delicious, but it seemed odd that they came out at the same time as the burgers. Couldn't we have gotten it during the lengthy wait for the meal?"}
{"text":"Aloette is the place to go if you're looking to head into a diner but want to impress a date or the friend your bringing along so you head to an upscale diner. The atmosphere and ambience of the resturant is rather live, as well as has a contemporary feel to it. I loved the windows which gave natural lighting into the Restaurant which was lovely. Note that it dosen't seat many, so therefore they accept walk ins only. My bf and I were lucky to get a booth before the place got packed a little after 12pm. 

Our server was fairly friendly and was thoughtful in introducing the menu to us as well as letting us know about portion sizes of tge dishes and about how many dishes to get if we were sharing. We ended up ordering the Crispy Squash (recommended by our server), Iceberg Wedge (recommended by a cook that works at the resturant), Hamichi Sashimi and foie terrine (Which my bf had high expectations for!). 

While waiting for our food, we got complementary toasted cheese bread with yeast butter which was phenomenal. 

However when our actual food came, we were a bit let down as it didn't full meet our expectations. The crispy squash was nothing special for my bf and I as it was similar to a sweet potato poutine, it was good with the carrying textures and the addition of the toasted sunflower seeds. However, the sauce that was poured on top was a bit rich for the both of us and it got sickening half way through. The hamichi was also a bit of a let down as we didn't find the flavors to suit very well, plus the cut of the fish and pears were too large that it felt awkward to have to cut them into smaller pieces. I liked the foie terrine as I found it tasty along with the grapes and cherries that were also on the dish, however my bf was disappointed that the foie had chunks of duck in it rather than it being fully smooth. To our surprise, the iceberg wedge was our favorite dish and it was actually one we didn't consider getting if it wasn't for one of the cooks reccomending us to try it and saying it was his favorite. The chive dressing was light and delicious, as well as the puffed wild rice was a nice additional crunch to the salad that made it enjoyable. 

The portions were large enough that we felt stuffed after we ate. Perhaps my bf and I ordered the wrong things for our first visit. The cook there did reccomend us to try the burger, but we were hesitant that it'd be too much... but since the iceberg wedge he suggested was bomb, we expect that the burger may be as well, so we do plan to revisit and try it next time!"}
{"text":"Went there after infinity mirrors today, we were seated very fast, no lines ahead of us. We were told that they changed the menu, so the squash dish is gone :( and the sea urchin dish was sold out :(

With the friendly recommendation of our server Hannah, we ordered the big eye tuna, beef carpaccio, asparagus and roasted lamb. The tuna dish very tasty. It's sweet, hot, with some acidity. The beef carpaccio is okay, the fired mushroom and pickled mushroom are very tasty, the beef not that flavorful. The asparagus with cheese sauce is very fresh, very crispy. We can taste the sweetness from the fresh asparagus. The lamb is my favorite dish! So flavorful! The lamb is super tender, goes fantastically well worth the arugula and the seared pepper. 

To be honest, all 4 dishes are rather oily. We can see the asparagus, beef or lamb drenched in oil in the last few bites. But overall, it was a pleasant experience, we'll go back again to try the see urchin!"}
{"text":"Super pricey for happy hour but I can see why this is the new hot spot. Their food was great but more importantly the space had been designed to the more minute detail.  From the personal cost racks to the streetcar-esque seating. This is is perfect spot for after work drinks and first dates.  Get here early though!! 

They don't take resos"}
{"text":"I may be the outlier here or a victim to the over-hype, it's hard to say. I have not been to Alo (their sister resto) but have heard good things. The same goes for Aloette, I've heard a lot of buzz surrounding the two places. So we finally were able to give it a try...

First off - The menu was limited to the point where I was quite indecisive on what to order; so we opted to try a couple of apps (scallop tostada & tuna tartar) and split the Alloette Burger between the two of us...

The tuna tartar was pretty good and a decent portion. The scallop tostada was tasty, but they were small and not a lot of scallop came with the order. As for the burger; it was super popular. I sat near the kitchen and almost every table in the place had ordered one. However; in my opinion it was just ok... If you are selective with your burger (as I am), you may not be too impressed. It's slightly bigger than a slider and a bit bland. The beef patty was cooked well done and dried out, which leads me to assume the quality of beef is of low grade - condiments were a must...

Additionally, our server told us that our order was enough food for two, but I could have had more...

For what it's worth, the others at my table had the black forest sundae
for dessert and absolutely loved it!

I wouldn't necessarily write this place off per se, I would be open to trying other items on the menu. But I wouldn't make it my priority to return any time soon..."}
{"text":"I have yet to successfully get reservations at Alo, so I thought why not try out the sister restaurant Aloette? Aloette doesn't take reservations, it's first come first serve - meaning you probably want to plan your visit to avoid peak hours where you might have to wait a long time. After chatting with a fellow yelp friend who went on a Saturday at 5pm, and got seated after a half hour wait, I decided to also come for early dinner on a Friday evening. My friend and I got to Aloette at 5:15pm on a Friday and got seated right away. The restaurant was around 70% filled when we got there and it seemed like you can get a table pretty quickly up until 6ish on a Friday. We got seated by the bar which was surprisingly comfortable. Never once did I have to adjust myself on the bar stools or felt like I was falling off (some bar chairs are really high and uncomfortable).

We ordered the Beet Salad, Atlantic Cod and Beef Short Ribs. I am normally not a beets person but omg this beet salad was delicious! There were a lot of flavours and textures in the salad. I like the texture of the yellow beets they used over the more popular red beets; the malt crumbs and quinoa added crunchiness to the salad. And since the beets were slightly sour due to the vinegar-y dressing they used, the sweetness from the pomegranate balanced it. The Atlantic Cod dish is a Japanese influenced dish with miso butter and shiitake mushrooms. I love the flavour of this dish as well and it's just different from what you would normally expect when restaurants do a Japanese spin on their food. This is also my friend's favourite dish of the three. Last but not least the short ribs were really tender and juicy and you won't be disappointed, but flavour wise because I do eat a lot of Asian food, the short ribs reminds me of the Chinese beef briskets I can get readily at a lot of Chinese restaurants so I would probably opt for something else next time! I should also mention the portions are pretty decent as you can see from the pictures. We were full and did not have room for dessert. Service was excellent throughout the meal.

Overall I am happy I finally got to try Aloette with no wait, and the style and flavour of this restaurant is just my kind of food. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Here is a restaurant with top notch service, amazing food, and great atmosphere. No wonder it's packed from 5:30pm on a Wednesday night. I came with 3 other friends for a girl's night out without a reservation, and we were super lucky to get seated right away. Most parties of 2 were seated at the bar, while groups of 4 would be seated at the booths. 

I want to keep this review short because everyone should try this place for themselves. I will just say that everything we picked from the menu tasted amazing and I recommend sharing everything with the table so that you can try as many things as possible, especially the apple pie sundae."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 

Atmosphere: 4/5

Service: 4/5

Went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and luckily didn't have to wait to get seated. There were two of us and we asked if we could sit in a booth but were told that the booths were reserved for 3 or more. This wasn't a huge deal for us but we noticed that two other people (an older couple) came in a few minutes after us and were seated at a booth. We ended up sitting at the bar which was actually awesome because I got to check out all the food that was being served out. We ordered the iceberg wedge to share, salmon sashimi and burger. The food was delicious and fresh! I highly recommend their burger and iceberg wedge which had so many flavors. The salmon sashimi reminded me of a fancy poke but without the rice - not bad but not amazing. I will definitely be back to try their katsu (looked huge and beautifully played) and scallops."}
{"text":"I have dined 3 times at Aloette and each time has been wonderful! The food is delicious and creative. The service is friendly and professional. The Aloette burger ranks as one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The lemon meringue pie for dessert was delicious! Aloette is an amazing new restaurant and I look forward to dine here in the future."}
{"text":"This place did not meet my expectation. Over priced and food was fair at best. However the service was amazing. Wish I could rate just that. But obviously not a reason to return. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Amazeballssss. Hands-down one of the best burger joints in town. 

Greeted by a friendly server and got a booth right away since we came at a non-peak hour.  
The place is well designed, like a upscale diner with mid-century elements. 
                                                                       
We ordered the brussels sprouts and crispy squash to start. You can tell they put a lot of thoughts on the side dishes because it was effing delicious. You'll know a good restaurant when they know how to make brussels sprouts taste good. As for the burger, I got the Tuesday Burger special that was loaded with onions, thick juicy bacon and a juicy patty. Patty was perfectly cooked, also a side of fries topped with cheese sauce was included in the special.

Food came out quickly and the servers were quick to fill up our water glasses. Everything was on-point. Left the place extremely satisfied and will be back to try to rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing little diner owned by Alo (which is located right upstairs). Although Aloette does not take reservations, it is a must try if you're in the Queen and Spadina area. I would highly recommend having the rib eye steak with beech mushrooms, the famous aloette burger (comes with fries) and the scallop tostada!! I also had the chocolate malted shake which was super delicious!"}
{"text":"An extraordinary little restaurant amid a sea of mediocrity at Spadina and Queen West. The Tuna Tostadas are insanely good, and the Chickpea Panisse, little pillows of chickpea dumpling are unbelievable. 

Attentive, knowledgeable and friendly service, a great wine list make lunch here a treat."}
{"text":"Extremely busy yet somehow managed to keep service on point. We waited about 30 min for a table. They take your phone number down and you get a text when your table is ready.

Was definitely worth the wait. Food was fresh and flavorful. We had the burger and it was the best burger I've ever eaten. Texture and flavor come together in a wonderful happy haze. I find myself craving another one now....

Beef tartare was very good as was Cornish hen. This place is such a gem. Wish they were open on sundays, but I guess these food magicians need to have a rest too.

They have made a lot of menu changes. While I found myself missing some items (Mac and cheese) there were several new menu items that reassured me that change is  for better sometimes too.  Also cheers to the mixologist, drinks are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Aloette is a causal french bistro locates on the ground floor of same building of its well-known sister, Canadian's best restaurant, Alo. Although Aloette is supposed to be more down to earth, it doesn't mean the level of service or food are lesser quality.

I was greeted by the friendly manager when I entered the bistro, and they offer coat check service. The restaurant was small and cozy; tables can fit group of 4 at most. The decor is classy and resemble Alo's style. I was seated at the bar and was excited to see the beautiful dishes coming out from kitchen.

The menu is simple yet it covers the seafood, meat, vegetarian options in appetizers and mains. The drink menu offers choices of cocktail, beer, wine, pops and juice. I tried the Beef Tartare appetizer with a Kale Celery juice. 

My food and drink arrived at the same time and came with a complimentary bread and spread. First of all, the portion of the beef tartare was pretty generous. The beef was very fresh and nicely topped with sauce made with horseradish, caper, Dijon. The sauce was little on the salty side. The Kale juice was refreshing as well. The bread and spread on the house was warm and fresh. 

Service was attentive during my whole meal; my glass was never empty. My waiter (I believe he is the manager) came regularly to ensure everything was fine. Even chefs were friendly and gave me friendly smile. Since it was the first official day of service, Chef Patrick Kriss was there and he greeted me.

I will definitely go back with my friends to try all the dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Aloette is the baby sister to the famed and lauded Alo restaurant.  Though it has similar philosophy to food, it's focus and approach is quite different.  Encouraging you to use your fingers and lick every amazing sauce, I would say Aloette redefines the word 'diner' in every sense.  Actually, it redefines how you can have amazing and delicious food in Toronto while still being relatively affordable and quick. 

Aloette sits on the first floor of the same building of Alo.  It's blackened exterior just hints that this space is more than a simple building on the edge of the Toronto Spadina Chinatown.  From looking at all the great shots on the website, Aloette looks like a larger space ... it isn't.  There's maybe has 6 tables that could fit 4 comfortably and a long bar seating that is for couples.  Maybe another 12 spots at most would fit.  That being said, you never feel claustrophobic squished even at the bar.  The spacing between seats and tables prevents that.  The atmosphere is modern and cozy ... bordering on refined luxury but the use of warm woods keeps it out of the cold extravagance.

To say Aloette is busy is an understatement.  Even an early arrival shortly after 5 pm on Saturday requires you to wait.  The good news is that we didn't wait terribly long and they do let you drop your number.  We were told 30 minutes wait but it turns out it was only 10 minutes at most.  Be prepared to have a wait longer than an hour for a prime time seating (7 pm any day really).

Service here is friendly, authentic, genuine, and amazing.  I've seen at other high end spots that a hostess or server face would drop in annoyance or frustration once they turn their heads away from the client.  Not here once... either Aloette deserves their own Oscars or everyone here genuinely likes being here and giving the best experience.  Even when it's super busy, not a glass goes unfulfilled or a moment to check in is missed.  Host and Hostess here have an alarming memory to remember faces and recall when you last dined with them.  

The food... dear god the food.  I happily eat here to put myself in a food coma.  Media and crowd sourcing reviews have put Aloette at the highest level in Toronto and it's 2200% deserving.

Crispy Squash - To call this just squash is a complete understatement on how good vegetables can be. Tender with a natural sweetness, the squash is in a crispy hot parmesean crust that just brings the savoury and bold flavours forward.  The brown butter sauce that coats every piece and the crunchy nutty pumpkin seeds bring added elements you didn't know you needed in your life.  It makes my inner vegetarian bunny just weep in happiness.  I hope they never take this off the menu.  My favourite squash dish in the city.   5+/5

Long Bean Tempura - We got this and the squash at the same time.  Though I love a good tempura, the squash just overshadowed this very good dish.  The wonderful garlicky aioli brings a nice bite of flavour to the subtle light flavour of the green bean.  The beans are served super hot and the tempura crust gives a nice textural crunch before giving way to the tender vegetables.  The addition of the fried acidic capers helps cuts through the richer aioli.  4.5/5

Tuna Tostada - Thinly sliced raw Tuna, crisp apple strips, mild kimchi, and a crispy corn chip.  Eating this with your hands is a bit of a fun trip as you try not to look like a complete glutton shoving it all into your mouth.  Otherwise you try to bite through it and leave shards of chips all over the place or have half the tuna hanging out of your mouth.  Texturally, loved it with crispy apple pieces and tender tuna.  Flavour wise, I felt it was very good but could have been a bit bolder with their kimchi.  It looks potent with it's fiery red but it's quite mild.  4/5

Beef Short Rib - Holy eff where has this dish been all my life.  This was an amazing dish with it's bold chimichurri sauce drizzled over a super tender and beefy short rib.  You can cut through the large giant pieces with a butter knife.  Though you can explain it as being 'fall apart tender' from an extended long cook time, it still had that wonderful chew you drool over in a good piece of beef.   The addition of the shishito peppers and shallots just bump up the flavour from great to mind blowing good.  A generous portion too.  5+/5

French Fries side - They're known for their famed 2 day process of cooking and these were very very good.  Every fry was crunchy yielding to a tender starchy potato.  It reminds me of the great British duck fat fries I've had in London at a 1 star Michelin place.  One of my favourites in Toronto. The cute metallic fry holder is an awesome call back to my McHappy place. 5+/5

Lemon Meringue Pie - Toronto's best lemon meringue pie? Oh yes possibly.  Bold & sweetened yet tart citrus flavour is showcased in a luscious curd and topped the fluffiest bruleed meringue.  You get a large slice but I didn't want to share. Amazing.  #MoreforMe 5+/5"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Despite a long wait of one hour (understandable for a table of 5) we had excellent food and excellent service. If you want to spend big both the Caviar Ricci Toast and the Ribeye are phenomenal dishes."}
{"text":"With all the hype around Alo and not being special enough to get a reservation, my friend and I managed to snatch a table early Thursday evening at the slightly less ritzy Aloette (walk-in only).  

We decided to go with appetizers all the way after hearing that the mains were mostly uninspired.

Scallop Tostada, $14. Tangy and refreshing with sizeable scallops. Great mix of textures and flavours. 
  
Hamachi Sashimi, $18. A+ without a doubt. The hamachi was fresh, the pairings (avocado, coconut, asian pear, lemon balm) and the sauce were perfect. Must order

Foie Gras Terrine, $18. Savoury and rich, there is a lot going on with the generous portion of terrine, the grape compote, the peanuts, the toast. 

Sea Urchin on Toast, $22. Least favourite of the night. Taste seemed out of focus but uni lovers may find it more enjoyable.

Deserving of the reputation. The menu was distinctive and all the ingredients tasted really fresh. You could tell that there was thought put into the different elements of each dish."}
{"text":"After having visited alo for my birthday late last year, I made it a point to visit aloette as soon as the weather became nicer.

After months of being tortured watching other people post photos of uni toast, we decided to go to aloette and try it for ourselves. 

With a no-reservation rule, we walked in at 7pm and I foolishly believed when Google told me the avg wait time was 30 minutes. We were given a 2-hour wait time. 

With no bar area or anywhere really to go, we had to wander a few blocks down to the black bull for some aperatifs before the meal. Finally got a seat around 9:15pm, ordered a couple of cocktails and .... Were told that they had sold out of uni toast. 

After much hemming and hawwing, we settled on the torched scallops, the parisienne gnocchi and the roasted Lamb. We were also given a plate of the house-made cheese bread and butter... Which, I feel bad in sayin, but was the best thing that night. 

The scallops were sweet and tender and cooked to perfection. The gnocchi were tasty and the lamb was fall off the bone and very aromatic. 

I wish I could have given a half star more because I really wanted to love everything. While the dishes were very tasty, the 3 dishes and 2 cocktails came out to 130 before tips. 

I'll have to come back another time to try my hand at getting an earlier seat and a plate of the uni toast, but it's a bit disheartening having to wait 2 hours for a seat."}
{"text":"Aloette is the Sister of Alo located in the same building. 

A casual French bistro and a complete different approach to food compare to Alo. I love the concept and the playful menu.

The interior is chic and welcoming. Since it is first come first serve with no reservation, I suggest to come by early for dinner or a late lunch to minimize wait time. Since it is new and everyone wants to dine here, so don't be frustrated and surprised with the long wait for an available table.

Just like Alo, the service here is friendly and attentive. 

The dish here is great for sharing or even enjoy by yourself. And remember to save room for dessert!

3 of us shared:

Clam Casino ($14) - OK
Beef Tartare with Fries ($18) - Excellent!
Hamachi Tostada ($14) - Meh, hamachi over powered by other items
Lamb Shoulder Salad ($25) - Good
Broccoli ($9)  - Excellent
Apple Pie Sundae ($10) - Excellent

Most of the dish we ordered was a hit. And I have notice the menu kept changing, so hopefully my next visit I would love everything I order!

And of course I would be back!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for dinner at Aloette for the first time this week and I'm glad we did. This is my favourite  new restaurant of 2017. Aloette is the casual sister to Alo, upstairs. The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.

We sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.

We started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.

The mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.

For dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.

Service was impeccable. My wife was given samples of two wines to compare when she couldn't decide, a touch that I always appreciate. The wine list could be a bit more extensive but this is a quibble. A fantastic new spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...

\"I consider myself a burger connoisseur, so the Aloette burger ($18) was a natural choice. And after one bite, I knew I'd savour every mouthful. On the patty were the perfect proportions of sautéed onions, shredded lettuce, mayo and fried Beaufort cheese. It was a classy burger, as I'd expect it to look at this establishment. While I could taste the quality of meat in the patty, it was cooked closer to well-done, which prevented the burger's natural juices from seeping out. Regardless, the components elevated this diner staple. And the fries...Mon Dieu! Hand cut, double-fried and crispy...\""}
{"text":"This was actually a really difficult review for me to write. To be quite honest, I was a bit underwhelmed by the food, as I had very very high expectations after reading so many rave reviews and knowing Alo's reputation. I enjoyed most of my dishes, but wasn't really blown away by any of them, and some of the dishes I actually didn't enjoy. Overall, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 (3 for the food, and 0.5 for the value/price point + service & ambience of the restaurant). My friend and I tried 5 dishes and left feeling very very full, and after splitting the bill in half paid around $40 each before tip.

The restaurant does not take any reservations, and apparently they cap their waitlist at 5 parties. Also, they only serve parties of 4 people or less. I came on a Thursday and put my name and number on the waitlist at around 5:40, and only had to wait about 15 minutes before they texted me telling me a table was ready. 

The menu isn't huge, but has a good amount to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. It also has great variety and a couple of really interesting-sounding dishes. We ordered the charred chorizo ($12), burgundy snails ($14), ribeye steak ($28), broccoli ($9), and brussels sprouts ($9). I enjoyed the snails, steak, brussels sprouts, and the complimentary bread that came before our meal (one piece per person) which was warm, fresh and fragrant. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I was a bit disappointed that the bone marrow butter didn't seem to add anything special to the steak. I thought the chorizo was actually too dry (perhaps overcooked?) although I enjoyed the eggplant and halloumi in the dish. The broccoli was a huge letdown, because I had heard it was really good, but found the dish WAY too salty. I think there might have been too much sauce, because by the end of our meal, it had just soaked through all of the broccoli and left it all soggy - we weren't even able to finish it.

I sadly would not place Aloette on my list of favourite restaurants in Toronto, BUT given the price point and sharing-plate style of dining, I wouldn't mind returning a second time to try some other items. The service is stellar, and I felt well-attended to from the second I entered until the moment I was handed my coat and bid farewell. The ambience is also great, because it does feel relaxed and fun, but still classy."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that this burger was probably the best burger I've had in years. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, nice milk bun and all the right fixins. They don't take reservations so we waited for about an hour, which is I guess not bad for Wednesday evening, we were seated around 8pm. The cheese bread was super fresh and the butter tasted like popcorn...or does popcorn just taste like butter? The beet salad was nice and fresh, golden beets were used and it was a nice end of winter kind of salad. We also had the scallop sashimi which was really delicious and good value, because there were a lot of scallops in the dish. Cocktail menu was lit - you could have whatever you like. Dessert menu was a bit lacking, nothing really caught my eye. Overall, I quite enjoyed my experience here - great service and great food. I'll be thinking about that burger from time to time, for sure."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, sat by the bar and staff was very attentive. Food is on the heavier/saltier end; the texture became a little predictable (complementary bread, crispy squash, fries from burger, pork rib + garnishing was all crispy), but the treatment they did before serving each dish (toasting it lightly) helped dehydrate and take away the oiliness of each dish. Absolutely addictive!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?

The roasted pork, the ribeye steak and the crispy squash. 
And the complimentary bread is great too!

We debated between the roasted pork and the Cornish hen and decided on the roasted pork at the end. We're happy that we went with the roasted pork because it was simply phenomenally delicious. Beware, it is on the fattier side because the pork is the pork belly so that's why it tastes meltingly oozing good. Full of flavour and the right proportion of fat to meat in alternate layers. Some chunks of pork salumi was also in the dish too. 

The ribeye steak just melts in your mouth. Ribeye steak has more marbleized patterns of fat to meat because of where it is on the cow so of course the juices are soaked into the fat of this type of steak. Meat was tender and the thickness was just right. Wasn't too thick and we got two slices of the steak! Marvellous. Fries were crispy and has a nice crunch. Wasn't hard and wasn't cold, so you know you're getting fresh fries to order.  The chimichurri sauce was a nice addition to the steak as well because it compliments well with the steak. 

Crispy squash is not something you see on a menu everyday. It's a nice side dish to have on a cold winter evening. Squash reminds me of the fall and cold weather and thought it was a fitting dish. It's unique because it's garnished with roasted pumpkin seeds and brown butter is poured on here. Has a sweet finish so if you don't like your sides sweet, you might not like this dish. But it's very rich in the taste of butter..reminds me of cream cheese actually!

The ambiance in here is spectacular! Very cozy and makes you feel like home with their utmost on point customer service. Alo takes pride in their amazing detail oriented customer service and you can see their attention to patrons' needs in their service here too. Waiters and waitresses are always making sure glasses are full, spills are wiped and cloths are folded when customers leave their seats among other things that they do. Goes a long way when customers are having a great meal that is complimented with impeccable customer service!

LAST TIP?!

There's no reservations allowed and it's only walk in. So if you want to grab a seat, either come a later time in the evening like 8-9 or on those cold winter days, that's when the traffic is not as high and you have a better chance at getting a spot. Otherwise, wait times can be upwards to an hour or more!!!"}
{"text":"I expected much more from this pretty, a bit pretentious restaurant. The food was very mediocre. 
Although the atmosphere was nice, the bar was too tight for having a meal and the host was a bit judgmental. 
I couldn't taste the tuna in the tuna tostada dish, the chip was overpowering everything else. The fresh sea urchin on toast was lost on the buttered bread. Paying premium for the freshness without even tasting it: Sad! 
The best dish was hamachi sashimi, ( maybe 3 out of 5). The pickled pear was almost inedible , but the fish was very nice and fresh. 
I can't justify the prices for this level of food."}
{"text":"Diner style french cuisine, very interesting.  Food was above average which means its quite good and you pay for it.  You will get a similar offering at other good restaurants as well at this price point.   Smart menu selection was limited to keep service on point .  Decor was nice but nothing unique to write home about.  Overall I would come back if I was around."}
{"text":"Overall, very rich and fatty dishes that's pricey but really worth trying for their uniqueness and textures. The interior reminds me of a small upscale diner and they had great service.

//THE FOOD//
There was complimentary in-house made toasted bread with yeast butter, which I thought was only OK. 
SALMON SASHIMI SALAD (3/5) - refreshing and well-balanced. But very expensive for what it is.
FOIE GRAS TERRINE (3.5/5) - super heavy and very filling. I'd suggest sharing this because all the fattiness could be overwhelming. The chunks of duck, bits of orange, and lemon sauce was a nice break from the extremely rich and butter-like foie gras though.
PARISIENNE GNOCCHI (5/5) - my most favourite thing I had. It was so rich in flavours and texturely variant. I loved everything from the crispy bits, refreshing bites of snap peas, fluffy little gnocchi & juicy mushrooms and snails. The sauce was frothy and savoury. 

Next time I'm at aloette, I have my eyes on their famous burger & the pineapple Sundae looks humongous!"}
{"text":"Located just below Alo, the #1 restaurant in Canada at the moment, Aloette is Patrick Kriss' more relaxed, low key restaurant with a retro diner feel, lower price point and surprisingly generous portion sizes while still maintaining the same great service and quality as its sister restaurant. We dined as a party of three and were so stuffed that we had to pack some of it home.

To start we were offerred complementary homemade cheese bread. I absolutely loved the bread as it was not overly cheesy (the cheesey bits seemed to be on the crust only and the bread itself was light and fluffy. It came with yeast butter which was rich, buttery and delicious.

For appetizers, we had the Beef Tartare ($14) and the Scallop Tostada ($14). Topped with a creamy horseradish and dijon sauce and then covered with capers, scallions and warm crispy fried onions, the tartare was a delicous mix of tangy and savoury. The beef was fresh and not too ground up making it perfect for spreading onto the gem lettuce leaves that accompanied the dish. I really liked the different textures in this appetizer. The crispy lettuce and fried onions really added a nice crunch and freshness to the beef tartare. And to top it all off, the portion size was quite generous - more than enough for three people to share.

The Scallop Tostada was also extremely tasty. The homemade tostadas were light and crispy. They were then topped with Hamachi sashimi, diced Granny Smith apples, pickled pearl onions, jalapeño and cilantro resulting in a tangy sweet burst of flavour. One order comes with three tostada - perfect for a light snack!

For our mains, we had the Aloette Burger ($18), the Roasted Pork ($20) and the Ribeye Steak ($36). The the juicy burger comes sandwiched between two house made buns and is topped with sauteed onions, shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese mayo and fried Beaufort cheese. On the side, there's a pile of addictive double-cooked fries, a pickle, and the tangy dressing which has a bit of a kick at the end. The fries were incredibly good and we were told that it takes two days to make since they need to soak the potatoes overnight in order to remove the starch and sugars required to make the perfect crisp fry.

The ribeye was rich and buttery and glazed with a chimichurri sauce. The fresh, slightly spicy, garlicky and citrusy sauce really brought out the deep earthy flavours of the beef. The steak was topped with few sautéed shishito peppers which added a grassy, smoky and citrusy component to the dish. To finish off the plate, there was another generous serving of fries.

My favourite of all the main dishes was the Roasted Pork. It had a good fat to meat ratio and was extremely juicy and tender. The pork was the topped with , sautéed esacarole, chopped cerignola olives, and nduja (a spreadable mixture of pork, fat and chilli) resulting in an amazingly earthy, zesty and spicy flavour combination. A must have!

As sides we added on the Brussels Sprouts ($9) and Aloette Fries ($9). You know a restaurant is great when they make Brussels Sprouts that you can't stop eating even when you're super full! They might not be much to look at but this would be the one dish that I would definitely order again and again. The Brussels Sprouts were roasted beautifully so that they were soft and tender on the inside but perfectly browned one the outside with lots of loose leaves that are nice and crispy. The sauce was a tangy sweet maple gastique with chopped walnut and whole mustard seeds giving it some interesting textures. The flavours were a mix of tangy and savoury with a little bit of sweetness from the roasting. Absolute perfection! The acidity of this also really helps to cut through the richness of the other dishes you may order!

The Aloette fries with smoked gouda hot sauce and jus, was the one dish we could have done without. Because the fries were covered with the melted creamy gouda, it overpowered the delicious fries themselves and made the fries less crispy. I think I actually preferred the fries on their own. The flavour to me was actually a little mild and I had difficulty detecting the smokiness of the gouda.

For dessert, we tried the Lemon Meringue Pie ($10). Personally, I found this just ok (but keep in mind that lemon meringue is usually not my dessert of choice).  The lemon flavour really came through in the pie and the filling was actually quite tart. I was impressed with the meringue which had a nice subtle lemon flavour and the sweetness of the torched marshmallows helped to balance out the tartness of the pie. Probably a good choice who prefer tart desserts."}
{"text":"Went this week for a second time and felt compelled to post a review. Both times were fabulous experiences with amazing service, the food is incredible (especially for the price) and great selection of drinks (cocktails, beer, wine, etc all good options and servers happy to help with selection). Decor is amazing and has an awesome casual vibe generally. I definitely recommend sharing dishes amongst your table so you can experience as many as possible. 

The first time I went was a group of 5 on a Friday night - there was ~an hour wait - but they will text when ready, so we grabbed a cocktail just down Spadina and walked over when ready. 

Pro tip - walked right in Tuesday night at prime time and was seated within minutes, so if you're looking to check it out maybe consider a weeknight."}
{"text":"Top notch food and beverages. Long wait for a table, but can have a cocktail while standing and waiting. Great service."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Alo's little sister downstairs. I went to Aloette with my fiancé on a Friday night around 9:15 p.m. or so and was able to get couple seats at the bar after 5 minutes. It was busy. Atmosphere was great and casual, not pretentious. The coat check is nice seeing as you can't put your coats anywhere if you're sitting at the bar. We ordered a bunch of items to share and I must say, they were all deeeee-lishhh!

We ordered the scallops tostadas (soooo good and refreshing!), buffalo stracciatella, octopus & pork belly (so juicy and tender, sooo yummy!), and foie gras terrine.
The highlights for us were the octopus and scallops tostadas. They're definitely a must!

We finished it off with the pecan pie, which was a generous serving, about 1/6 of a pie, and wasn't overly sweet. The pecans were nicely candied and roasted even I liked it (note: i'm not a dessert kinda gal).

Drinks were great too! Midway through our bites, Chef Patrick Kriss came down from Alo to see how things are going downstairs, he recognized and greeted us as we both have dined at Alo many times before. I'm surprised he remembered!

Anyways, we both thought Aloette lives us to the hype and to the standards that Alo has set for those who've managed to dine there prior.

Chef Kriss did it again! Very impressed and will definitely be back soon to try the other items on the menu!"}
