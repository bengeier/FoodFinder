{"text":"My review is biased because I have worked at Bistro Frejus, but truthfully this is a \"salt of the earth\" restaurant. The 3 owners are truly magnificent people who work long hours to provide delicious food and personalized service. The staff is happy to work there, whether they're dishwashers, cooks, or servers.  The menu is original and delightful, and anyone who lives in Verdun should check out this restaurant (even if they don't include bacon in their brunch menu). The dishes are Pinterest-worthy, and the soups are exquisite. I've worked in many restaurants, and this place is a real gem! Extremely family-friendly too! Must tries: salmon mango pasta; crêpe Frejus; cajun pizza"}
{"text":"Endroit par excellence pour un déjeuner délicieux et vraiment original car leur brunch est varié. Bonne portion et bon prix.  L'ambiance de l'endroit est vraiment chaleureux, on se sens chez soi à cet endroit. J'y viens avec des amis et c'est super de discuter et d'y passer de bons moments.  Pour ce qui est du service, il est attentionné et vraiment amical. On sens la chaleur de l'endroit par les gens qui y travaillent aussi.  Un incontournable si vous êtes dans le coin!"}
{"text":"After 2 hours of Kayaking, my girlfriend and I were starving and we saw that this place was only a few blocks down and had gotten great reviews online. The place is very cozy and the waitress was very friendly and efficient, we came in 1 hour before closing and ordered a meal with desert and coffee and never felt rushed by the staff, I even asked for the bill because I felt bad and was told not to worry and to finish my coffee first.  As for the food, the portions were huge and tasted great. I had the chicken burrito and my gf had the salmon crepe. I did enjoy the burrito quite a bit, the salmon crepe was good, but not at the same level as the burrito.  I left the restaurant with a smile and will definitely return.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Family brunch, enjoyed by all. Young child with us, for which they are totally prepared. Staff very friendly and helpful. Portions more than adequate"}
{"text":"You can really sense the effort in Frejus the moment you step in until the time you leave. Staff here really gives you 100% in service and food. Coming in late Sunday night, I ordered the legumes grillés pizza which is a pesto based vegetarian pizza with mozzarella, caramelized onions, zucchini and sunflower seeds. As someone who likes to experiment with food, this combination of toppings suited me just fine, especially when the pie comes loaded to the brim with the above ingredients. While dining staff checked in often to ensure our water glasses were never empty, and went the extra mile, offering to turn up the heat since we were by the window. Then, when my friend and I lost track of time and had yet to settle up after closing, our server remained cheery and friendly, reminding us only subtly they had to lock up for the night. The hospitality here honestly felt like I was being welcomed to and dining in a neighbour's home. Highly recommend and will be back again!"}
{"text":"A nothing-special place to me. Little restaurant/cafe where we went to grab brunch. First impression? Very kid friendly. Almost every table had a high chair with a kid next to it, and so that is the main vibe of the restaurant. We were seated and I ordered the apple and leek soup and chicken quesadillas which were definitely not what I expected...and not necessarily in a good way. I found myself underwhelmed by the food although I have to say that their chocolate cake was delicious!  One small complaint on my part is that anytime we spoke to one of our servers in English she responded in French. Despite me being able to speak and understand French for the most part, I'm more comfortable in English in certain situations and, didn't appreciate the whole \"too bad I'll only speak to you in French\" thing. There were even times when myself and the group I was with asked for clarification because we didn't understand certain words, and the server just kept repeating what she was saying in French expecting us to magically understand if it was repeated. I found that really frustrating! Would've given 3 stars, but docked one of this reason. Not really interested to come back to be honest!"}
{"text":"While staying at a bed and breakfast down the street I tried this place with my girlfriend. We found the food to be good, though not great. The service was also a bit slow for my liking -- but I'm a New Yorker...  I would recommend if you are in the area and looking for cute ambiance and a decent bite."}
{"text":"Inconsistent  I went to Le Frejus three times and the first times I ate there the food was good, not great.   My first visit I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with wine. The wine was actually pretty good. The waiter and service was prompt and effective if a bit too serviceable.   The second time I went I ordered basically the same thing but this time the meal wasn't as good as before and the wine was extremely weak...watered down? The waitress was funny but a bit too loud (joking and yelling, not saying, suggestions). I didn't like the experience. But even so I tried it again just to make sure it wasn't just a case of the cook having a bad day.   So the third time I ordered the grilled chicken and caesar salad with some red wine. The chicken was cold from the fridge (grilled?) and the salad was ok but overstuffed. The wine was disappointing, not as good as the first time I went there. I ordered some dessert and it was good but I don't believe they make it at the restaurant. The waitress was terrible. I had to ask her for some water after waiting minutes on end for her to make an appearance even if the place was almost empty.   Later that might I became sick to my stomach and I couldn't sleep at all.  Because of my last experience I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Good spot to eat breakfast outside on a nice summer day. The food is better and more interesting than at the typical breakfast chains and it's reasonably priced ($12.50, coffee or OJ included)."}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant et la bouffe est originale, mais en fréquentant d'autres établissements j'en dis venu à la conclusion que je prix est un peu élevé pour un brunch en famille"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place so much! I had their latte (with soy) and tried their chocolate caramel cake and maple pecan (I think that's what it was called) cake, and they were all phenomenal. Hands down the best cake I've had so far in Montreal. They were both explosions of flavours, and the different textures within the cakes were in harmony. Man, I need one of them right now. My mom said the food there is amazing too, so I can't wait to check that out the next time I go!"}
{"text":"Nice place in Verdun. I had one of the crepes and my partner had one of the pizzas.Simple and tasty, not sure it qualifies as a cafe as I did not notice any gourmet coffe being served, but would return."}
{"text":"Very simple place but the food is tasty. So don't go there and bring a fancy date for example... ;) Went for lunch. The veggies soup was amazing, the crepe was good too, the special was prosciutto, brie, apple and walnuts. Got a chocolat pie as desert. Not very noise, good to hear what the other person is telling you. Service also was fast, what makes it even better."}
{"text":"Dans un décors vintage, ayant un ameublement dépareiller de meuble recyclés, y règne une ambiance familiale et décontractée. On en témoigne d'ailleurs par les nombreuses familles qui s'y retrouvent, bref digne d'un bon veux brunch en famille chez nos parents!   Outre sont décors, on y retrouve également un bref menu, mais oh combien savoureux! J'y ai pris la crêpe à base de poudre de cacao... Un délice culinaire! Les saveurs sont développées, on y retrouve des combinaisons d'aliments surprenantes qui se marient incroyablement bien et ajoutent au plat une distinction incomparable. De plus, j'ai été ravi d'apprendre que tout est fait sur place, de la préparation à crêpe, à la vinaigrette qui accompagnent les salades!  Finalement, nous avons un service amicale qui nous fait sentir comme chez soit!   Ce restaurant était une révélation pour moi, définitivement le secret le mieux garder de Verdun!"}
{"text":"Just not my type of restaurant, although it is a favorite among the Verdunites. The food is always fresh and the price is great, but I just don't like how it comes together. Each plate is either too rich or too bland. The chairs are uncomfortable and the tables are crowded together. You can get a little more leg room in the summer by sitting out on their terrace. One thing I enjoy about the place is their art displays of local talent. The art comes in many different mediums and is actually quite affordable.   I wish I could be as excited about this place as most people are in the neighborhood, but I have yet to be wowed by the food."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now: once for lunch and once for breakfast, and the food was great both times. It's not cheap, but it is definitely value for money - the food is worth it.  For lunch I had a great chicken wrap: It wasn't cheap but it was worth it, and packed solid with toppings.   For breakfast I had a completely different take on French toast, which I won't even try to do justice by describing, you've just got to try it yourself (I think someone uploaded a photo of it, check it out). Most of the breakfasts came with a bowl of latte, which is always a nice size."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Everything tastes delicious and fresh. The service is always very nice, the place is cozy and you feel like you are at home.  I usually go with my husband, but I also went with friends and we always see a lot of families that are regulars. The crepes are just amazing. The presentation of the doshes make them look even tastier. Prices are very affordable and fair. I didn't give it 5 starts because I wishe there was a few more options for brunch. Otherwise, this place is absolutely great!"}
{"text":"Great place, give us the feeling of a home made kitchen breakfast, great size coffee, delicious maple syrup French toast. I totally recommend it. I was just missing like a bowl of warm potatoes with garlic on the side. Also good brunch price."}
{"text":"Still one of the best bowls of \"café au lait\" out there. Extremely consistent. From the service to the quality, almost to the point of clockwork, which in the restaurant space is pretty rare - and remember this is not fast food. Good on them. Other café, resto, bistros should look up to them.   I'm not saying that they are perfect, and everything is 100%, but they deserve the kudos and therefore a 5. On a gloomy day - seems my previous review was on a day like this. Perhaps gloomy days are meant for cafes, but in that I digress.   Merci to the the team at Frejus.   PS Another standout, their crepes are very soft and stretchy, with good maple syrup."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympathique qui offre une belle sélection de brunchs. Seul point négatif : ils n'ont pas de bacon! Mais sinon tout le reste est parfait. Gros plus pour le bol de café ( au lait si le cur nous en dit ) qui nous réchauffe le cur."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a cold winter's day. Cozy and quaint atmosphere and friendly staff were only put off by a power cut. Even with that they maintained a smile and remained calm!  Varied and interesting brunch options to choose from. I took a frittata and my wife took buckwheat pancakes. Both were great and presented nicely!   Also note that this place is very kid friendly and they have a lot of high chairs as required!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Maple French Toast in Montreal.  I've been here twice now for brunch and have tried the aforementioned French Toast as well as crepes filled with Ricotta cheese and both of them were stellar.   Thick, fluffly pieces of bread, drenched in the egg mix and perfectly cooked, with maple syrup and pecans and swirls of whipped cream, this french toast is seriously rich and filling. You won't need to eat for the rest of the day. The ricotta filled crepes were equally rich and filling. Both dishes came with mounds of fruit and free coffee or tea.  Service is very friendly. I have not had dinner here yet but did eye the desserts counter, and from what I understand, everything is made on the premises and looked just as good.  A bit out of the way, but you can always walk over to the riverside a few blocks away and walk off the meal."}
{"text":"This is a nice, little venue which is very family friendly.  Colouring books, fresh (sharpened) crayons, kids menu were welcoming.  Our waitress generously offered for us to take a table with seating more than required for our family of four so we didn't have to worry about the kids knocking things over on the tiny bistro tables.  My wife and I both enjoyed the Amber Ale on tap.  I had an incredible pulled pork crêpe with Swiss cheese and maple syrup.  My son devoured a large portioned pizza, my daughter the kids ham & cheese crêpe, and my wife the chicken crêpe with white wine sauce.  We enjoyed the local art on the deep saturated orange walls and the generous natural light from the large windows at the front.  All in all, a nice night out and about a 20 minute walk from the apartment we are staying at in le Sud-Ouest.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone with children."}
{"text":"Je donne la même cote que la précédente mais cette fois-ci, mon avis est surtout à propos d'un de mes lunchs favoris en ville. Le wrap au poulet avec une sauce pesto citronnée est tellement bon, que je me dis qu'il est temps de revoir mon avis original! Plein de poulet, pas juste 2 ou 3 morceaux, savoureux, juteux et rafraîchissant. Servi avec une belle salade colorée, c'est le lunch idéal quand je suis trop paresseuse pour me faire à manger et que j'ai vraiment besoin de prendre une bonne pause et déconnecté pour une heure ou deux!  En pleine semaine, j'aime aussi fin d'après-midi pour une petite bouchée (les quesedilla sont vraiment bons aussi) accompagnée d'une bière et travailler pendant une heure ou deux. L'internet est fiable et les tables sont grandes et donc idéales pour être bien installé avec un laptop et une assiette! Le calme règne dans le café complet vers 15h environ, donc pour finir une journée ou une semaine chargée sur le bon pied, c'est un super bon refuge qui me permet d'être productive jusqu'à la dernière minute!"}
