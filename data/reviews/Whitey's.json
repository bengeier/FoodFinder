{"text":"Food and atmosphere is one of a kind. It has such fun and excitement in air everytime. The owner Jon is the most funny, kind and gracious man you'll ever meet. I suggest you shake his hand he will remember you. He is the son of whitey himself. Get a burger and you step back in time. Been the same since late sixties. Great staff. Willy will always make you smile and Amanda can write the order of entire party of twenty down in her head. No paper. Love this place. Sit next to any number of cavs fans and players.  See you there."}
{"text":"Terrible ,if you want to spend the night in the bathroom this place is a great choice for dinner . Food is extremely greasy . Service is slow at best . The decor beyond a need for a update . 
The only thing I can't figure out is why it's so busy . I would avoid"}
{"text":"Go to Whitey's for the food - unbelievable burgers, fries, onion rings.  They bring out the fries and rings ahead of the burgers though - so don't fill up on them before the main attraction arrives!  Have never had a better burger with perfectly melted cheese and sauteed onions.  How did Deanna C. have room for dessert?  :-)


It's a bar and it's small and it's a bit cramped and dark.  The dining room isn't going to appear in Architectural Digest any time soon.

But if you're hungry and craving a burger - this is the place.  And it's been the place for at least 25 years.  It even survived the disappearance of the Richfield Coliseum and all the patrons that facility brought to the area.

Long live Whitey's Booze 'N Burgers!"}
{"text":"Whitey's is a great, friendly bar with good food. Their French fries are hand cut and delicious! Their burgers are the best around, large, full of flavor, and juicy! They have a mug club for their regulars and everyone is welcoming!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Great chili (the original beef) and a gigantic chili dog. The service was quick and efficient. Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here often but I have to admit that I would classify myself as a fan. I have to say that I was impressed with the quality of food which is the main reason that I dine out in the first place. I think it's a great place to go after work to wind down with some booze and burgers so it's definitely appropriately named. Summary: Come on in... the water's fine!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat! Great food and atmosphere, only downside is since it is a popular site it's usually a long wait."}
{"text":"We're just passing through and looked up Whitey's on yelp-  thought we'd give it a try. The beer was great, the chili flight was fabulous, the Zeus burger was very good, the Westlight burger was excellent, the onion rings were above average, the service was prompt, setting was comfortable if murky, and we might well plan future trips to correspond with another visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after hiking all day in the national park and were very impressed with both our food and service! Burgers were fantastic and well priced for being a local joint! Would definitely recommend the Hotzerella Sticks as an appetizer! Great atmosphere and environment! Also, newly renovated and very clean bathrooms! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the chili here - we had the sampler and every one was awesome. Next time I will get this as my entree. We both got burgers. They were tasty, I was disappointed that my mushrooms were canned and not fresh. Fries were great. Great bar ambiance, it was packed at 5:45 on a Saturday and people continued to put in. Awesome choice!"}
{"text":"We don't get many date nights so when I gave my husband a few places to choose from I was so glad when he chose Whitey's! I had been here a couple of times, he never had been and he can be a bit of a food snob sometimes since he grew up working in restaurants . Our server was very attentive and personable, food was fantastic just like I remember. We shared some fries and jalape√±o coins, I ordered the Maggie, he got the Outhouse,, we only were able to eat half of what we ordered but brought the leftovers home. Definitely will share next trip. He said the burger was right up there with our favorite restaurant at Put in Bay. Successful date night!"}
{"text":"Always go here starving!  The burgers and appetizers are huge.  Our favorite app is Chili Chips 'N' Cheese, chips smothered with chili, grated cheese and sour cream.  My boyfriend always gets the Czar, a swiss cheeseburger with mushrooms, grilled onions, and roquefort dressing. On different days of the week they have 25 cent  wings, shrimp, or mussels.  The only reason for for four stars is they just started selling desserts, and the one I chose, a berry stacker, was extremely dry and dissapointing."}
{"text":"Now has a good beer selection. The jalapeno chilli is great! It's a cash only establishment so be prepared for that. There is an ATM inside though. They do a prime rib special twice a year that is good. It's also so close to home that it's a bit of a magnet."}
{"text":"Micheal Symon needs to eat at Whitey's and take a lesson.  Best burger in Cleveland.  The atmosphere is what a real buger joint should be.  They were a good size, juicy, and had plenty of toppings.  Fries and onion rings are unreal.  Mike Symon can win all the food network burger contests he wants, real burgers are made at places like this."}
{"text":"You know something is wrong with a place when, on the drive home, you find yourself thinking \"That was a pretty tasty burger. Too bad I'll never be back.\"

The pros:
- I ordered the Black and Bleu burger and it was good. 

The cons: 
- The service was lousy. The server acted like we were such an annoyance to her --- Took forever to take our order; didn't apologize when the food was obnoxiously late; never refilled glasses; gave us another big wait to get our check; didn't smile once or ask us how we were doing or anything. And I could have ordered sides, I guess, but she never asked and I didn't know my options.
- The place is pretty ugly, and I didn't like that you have to walk through the bar in order to get to the tables. But I wouldn't have cared in the least if the service had been welcoming.

SERVERS OF AMERICA! HEAR MY WORDS! There is nothing wrong with being welcoming! You don't have to do a song and dance or lay it on thick and fake. Just look people in the eye and great them. Smile once or twice. It's not that tough. There are lots of choices on where to eat, so make people comfortable to be in your establishment.
.

....Gosh darn it! That Black and Bleu burger really was yummy. Now I've got it on my mind again. Maybe I actually will be back. For takeout-only, this time."}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good. Although, our service was terrible. Our waitress was very rude and pushy. I felt like unless you are a regular they dont give a crap about you! Even when we paid the bartender our bill was $48 and I gave her $60. She gave me $2 back assuming I was leaving a 20% tip to our rude waitress. Who does that?! I wont be going back anytime soon! Sorry Whiteys"}
{"text":"A strange mix of things. That's what this place has.

Tucked in with some kind of plastics plant on Brecksville Rd, I always assumed this was a biker bar. As I have found out, it is, but there's more to it than that. The place is cash only, which I suppose is fine, and that is an argument I, as a patron, will lose with a business every time. So ignoring that, when you go to Whitey's you can play a variety of bar games, they have boccie and volleyball leagues, a lobster claw grabbing machine, and a full bar separate from the dining area in case you prefer to go for drinks instead of dinner.  

The food is good. It is in giant portions and it is satisfying. The burgers aren't cooked to order, which is ok. The meat is good, though, so at least the cook makes them consistently well. The fries are good, but how can you mess up fries?

Really, the only reason not to go here is for the chili. Everything else I had was great, and I would recommend the food to anyone. But the chili is just not for me. I know they are famous for their chili. It's sold in the supermarkets near me. But it tastes watery. And that is why I can only give it four stars. The one food they are supposed to do the best was very much my least favorite thing about the place. 

Also, this place gets busy in a hurry. Good for them, but bad for patrons. Expect 45min-1hr wait on any given Fri or Sat night."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago on a Saturday around early dinner time.  The food was good, the burger was ok, and their nachos were excellent.  I had heard how awesome the burgers were here, so I was a bit disappointed in the reality versus the expectation.  Those who had been with my party and had eaten there prior said same - the burgers were not as good as they used to be.  The waitstaff provided attentive service even though the place was packed in the dining room.  The one big thing about this place is how loud it was in the dining area.  It was so incredibly loud that we couldnt even hold conversations with people sitting across from us at the table.  The dining area is super small and cramped, the tables are practically on top of each other, and when it is a full room, it is just too loud for you to actually enjoy your dinner or your company.  Another negative is that they refuse to serve food at the bar high top tables, or out on the patio where there are more tables.  You can only eat either sitting at the bar (which is often full of regulars), or in the tiny dining room.  I doubt I will go back here.  It's not the best experience."}
{"text":"Burgers and Booze. I guess that sums it up nicely. You might add sand volleyball and darts to the list. 

Whitey's has been a Richfield favorite for some time now and even on a random Wednesday evening the place is alive with people.

The dining room is cozy (read tight) and atmospheric (read dim) and lends itself nicely to a friendly dining environment. The beer selection is moderate if not solid with staples and the burgers are generous. So are the servings of fries and rings. A serving of fries or rings is enough to share. 

I have had the Czar which overflows with mushrooms. You'll absolutely have piles of mushrooms left after the burger is gone. I have also had the fish sandwhich which is two battered filets of white fish. The filets taste like they were frozen and not fresh,  but I could be wrong.

Overall, a good place for a huge burger, a cold drink, and hanging out. Solid but short of spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and has poor customer service. If it was in any other neighbors filled with other quirky  \"dive bars\" it wouldn't last 6 months. First of all don't serve me fake \"krab\" soup and call it Home Made Lobster Bisque. Everything fried that we ordered was hard and overcooked and dried out. I hear their burgers are legit, but I won't be coming back to find out. And my apologies to our server for bothering her simply by being seated in her section.

 Oh and how could I forget, what a cluster-f: telling me I can't pay with cash (suck it up and pay the credit card processing fee like every other reputable bar, Whitey's!), and then making me wait at a crowded bar jus to pay for my disappointing food. 

This place is a joke."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend here for some drinks. It was a great atmosphere, family friendly. Cool little bar. An arcade room, with a South Park pinball machine (which adds a star to any place in my book). It looked mostly like a place that locals from Richfield and Bath hang out, which is cool. Nobody made us feel like we didn't belong or anything.

 I had a burger. It wasn't that good. I asked for it medium, it came out medium rare. The meat was bland. The bun was cold. Pretty bad burger. I also had some jalape√±o poppers, which were pretty good.

Overall, it's a nice little bar in the middle of nowhere. I'd go there again for drinks, but I won't be getting another burger there."}
{"text":"This place was hyped up to me by so many people. I was super excited to try it. The chili and fries were amazing but unfortunately that was the only good thing. The burgers, which I was most excited about, turned out to be a frozen patties. On top of that, it's only cooked one way...well done. Definitely disappointed. Was hoping for so much more. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. The burgers are large. The accoutrements are plentiful. The fries are served in a heaping pile. Unfortunately the burgers are not juicy but greasy. To the point of making the bun soggy. The fries are nice and brown on the outside but don't taste done on the inside. It could be because of the thickness. If you like fatter fries you might be satisfied. It's not bad but I just didn't find it worth the trip"}
{"text":"The food here is great, especially the pizza and burgers. With that said, the 3 stars is for the service/staff. The bartenders are so unfriendly and borderline rude. The one chic that waited on us lost her mind on me and started shouting when I made a comment about it being cash only."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, always try to make it here when in town. The jalepeno bites are the best thing on the menu, second to the juicy burgers! Can't wait to make it back!"}
{"text":"C'mon, you haven't been here? Been coming here since I was a little boy. Hands down the best burger and fries on the East Coast. Maggie burger baby. Great chili."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best burger I have ever had, and great beer selection. Try the chili flight, black and blue burger, wings, and we'll...everything. They have a little game room to entertain children, a volley ball court, and darts."}
{"text":"Throwback to the 70's in this joint!  So the interior needs a little \"sprucing up\"...who cares!  this is not exactly the type of place you come for the ambiance...this is all about the grub!

Burger, fries, rings, beer...need I say more?!?!?  We shared two different burgers, the Black & Blue (blue cheese and bacon) and the Maggie (mushroom overload!!!).  both were as juicy as could be and overflowing (literally) with flavor.  We also shared both fries and onion rings around the table and everyone loved both.

Lastly, the beer was cheap.  Don't think I'd last very long (on this planet) eating here often, but as a special treat I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"Living in Wadsworth, I had never heard of the restaurant. My wife and I went a couple weeks ago. Place was crowded and doing a great business!  We had a couple beers and then we finally got a table. Amazing burger selection!  Lots of good stuff. We ordered a couple different burgers and shared them. They were very good!  Service was also very good!

If you are in the area give it a try. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Good lord. We could hardly eat any of our food and my belly is like a volcano now. Kid didn't like his burger, I didn't like my chili Mac... the fries were ok and the rings were good...
An auspicious start to our vacation, first meal on the road and I have major heartburn"}
{"text":"Good burgers and chili.  The portion size for side items is for two.  I like it here.  I have two major issues with them.  First, they are cash only which is ridiculous in this day and age.  Two...they have strange hours.  The regulars who sit at the bar are harmless but can be annoying.  If you can get past those things I would recommend them."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local spot! The burgers are amazing (especially the hot n sticky - served only as their burger of the month in July) the drinks are always poured heavy and it's all cash. Willy is the best bartender ever and ya just can't beat the crowd of regulars. Game days are always a blast and there's always free apps at the bar. I love Whiteys!"}
{"text":"The only thing decent is the Spicy Chili. I had the chili flight and the other 3 were so bland they were barely edible on their own. Had to salt everything like crazy. It's like they don't believe in seasoning their food. I got the BOMB burger and was really looking forward to it. Again horrible. It was a gas station quality frozen burger patty that was completely unseasoned with Banquet TV dinner quality bland Mac and Cheese on top. It wasn't even appealing in the slightest after the first bite and that was even after pouring salt and pepper on top. The chef, cooks, management, and ownership should be ashamed of the lackluster food they are serving at such an iconic local landmark. 

Two thumbs down. Get it together in the kitchen and make quality food. 

Gross!!"}
{"text":"if i was reviewing Whitey's on the food alone, i'd give it 5 stars. The hamburgers I had was really good. I also had the chili flight appetizer. i have to tell you, the chili at Whitey's is incredible - the jalepeno beef being my favorite. 
the only complaint i had, and i should have spoken up when seated, was that the dining area we were seated in was really cramped and uncomfortable. i guess i could also complain about the \"cash only\" policy, but i knew that going in and was prepared w/ cash."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
I travel a lLOT and ended up in what I consider the middle of nowhere, or somewhere outside of Cleveland. I was here on business and the only restaurant within a few miles between where I am working and my hotel was Whitey's. The parking lot was packed, so I stopped and pulled out my laptop bag and went in thinking I could get a quick bite and some work done.
Both happened, but the place is amazing. No, the decor isn't 5 star, but that's not what anyone around in this packed place wants. It's a family place, but yet you feel so happy and free. It's got atmosphere and is noisy, and has a lot of character, but I still had a booth by myself and got my work done in their Internet, while enjoying the place completely. 
But wait! The unbelievable service (even though they are packed and super busy), the UNBELIEVABLE food! Did I say the UNBELIEVABLE food yet??? It is SOOOO good! I am coming back tomorrow night before I leave town. If you're anywhere around here you have to come in for a burger and some chili. LOVE THIS PLACE! It makes me want to come back to Cleveland, if that give you any perspective on how AWESOME this place is!!

*NOTE* Annoyingly, this place does NOT take credit cards! Still a great place, but I was very disappointed in this policy."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The burgers are huge! We ordered nachos and each a burger and my husband and I could have split a burger! So we had a lot of leftovers. I ordered a pizza for my kids which was small and not the best pizza so I would not recommend that for sure. I got the burger with everything and it was so good!! Fries do not come with the burgers. Also they serve cans of pop and charge like a 1.50 per can so that was kinda annoying. I thought the bar kinda smelled a little on the uriney side so that was kind of a turn off...but we sat in the dinning room away from the bar so that wasn't an issue only when walking to go to the bathroom. Food was good I would go back. Just make sure you take cash they DO NOT take any other form of payment."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and beer. I ate here for the first time last night, and there was a 45-50 minute wait. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and shared a pitcher of craft beer (only $12!) while we waited. The beer prices were unbeatable. Once we were seated, we got the wings for an appetizer, which were delicious. I had the bomb burger for my meal, which was a burger with bacon and mac n cheese on top on a pretzel bun. It was so big I had to take half of it home. The service wasn't the best, but they were very busy. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for cheap beer and great bar food!"}
{"text":"I preface with this review with the disclaimer that I am not from the area...but whenever I hear about \"Whitey's\", it is always followed by \"chili.\"  So naturally, I was excited to visit and taste for myself with this oft-lauded chili was all about.

I ordered a cup of the standard beef chili and a \"plate salad.\"  The salad was horrific - all iceberg lettuce with a few sad grape tomatoes and the BANE of my existence, shredded carrots.  UGH!  Definitely a \"1\" on the salad front.  To date, every place we've been in Akron defaults to iceberg lettuce in salads.  FAIL!

The cup of chili was passable.  It tasted good at first, but then the longer I ate it, the more the fatty beefiness began to coat my mouth in a greasy film of muckymuck.  There were not as many beans or veggies as I would have liked.  I felt really uncomfortably full after eating a tiny cup and the salad, so I can only surmise how many calories were hiding in that cup!

All in all, for the friendly atmosphere (more WOOD panels!), lively patrons, and heartiness of the chili, I give it a 2.5 rounded up to 3 stars.  I want to say that I probably won't be back, but family gatherings in Ohio being what they are, and choices being limited, I think we probably will be!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after driving into town. Great burgers!  Very large, in fact hubby and I shared a burger.  Kids loved it, good size burgers and beers!"}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here. We had heard for years how amazing the burgers and chili are and the busy parking lot gave us high hopes. Our first impressions haven't been good. It's cash only but these aren't the cheapest burgers ($8-11.50) and they don't include sides so things can add up quick. I think it's fine to be cash only...when it's clear your prices are low and you're trying to avoid the credit card fee. Their beverages are not listed on their menu. It's a bar so you'd assume they have fountain beverages. My husband orders a Coke and gets a can. When ordering I believe she should have mentioned it was a can. It would have likely changed his order. I highly doubt they use cans behind the bar... We both ordered a cup of chili. I got the BOMB burger and my husband got the firecracker. The chili was good. I got the original. I hate spicy chili so this was perfect. Get it czar with cheese and sour cream! It had chunks of meat which we liked. It was a very lengthy wait after our chili waiting for our burgers. My husband described his burger as overcooked but not dry. He thought the flavors went well together. The breaded jalape√±os gave it a nice crunch. The mac and cheese on mine was good. I'm not the burger aficionado my husband is but he seemed happy with the burger. There is definite room for improvement in other ways. We were told to pay at the bar which was...odd. We went to the packed bar that only had one bartender working and waited a few minutes. We had exact change so we ended up leaving the cash on the bar but it was just another hassle that kind of further solidified we wouldn't be returning. My husband also wanted me to mention the lobster tank that was a claw game. It looked dirty and I find the claw game to just be inhumane. Come to think of it, this formerly 3 star review is being dropped to 2."}
{"text":"Whitey's quality has really gone downhill. Their burgers used to at least look like people were hand-making them. And the beef taste was outstanding. Now they're just pre-formed patties. 

Blech!!! 

Been taking the family and friends here since 1994, but now we're done going there. Onion rings are not the sizes they used to have, but the french fries are still good. Wait staff is outstanding, but they can't make up for the apparent cheapness and increased profits that mgmt has chosen to skimp on. And of all the products to skimp on, their signature food, burgers! What a shame."}
{"text":"Cash Only!  Great dive bar and patio with outstanding chili - try them all.  Warning: Google hours are a bit off, the bar opens at 3pm but the kitchen opens at 4pm.  Saw a few disgruntled customers who walked in with us at the 3pm open time needing their chili or burgers right then but had to settle for delicious cold beer for an hour."}
{"text":"Ummm, Yum!!!! Delicious always!! The chili chips and cheese is my favorite!!! It's listed as an appetizer but it's always my meal! I wish I could get it to go!! They are always pretty busy but it's worth the wait! The onion rings, burgers, wings, and fries are all delicious too!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers and fries any where make sure to try the Maggie burger or the. Czar so good...first time ever horrible service 40 mins still no food the table behind us sat down 20mins after us has food ..not good"}
{"text":"First time visit on Father's day. The host was great. He had a wonderful personality and was very friendly. The wait was long and it's cash only but they have easy access to an ATM so that's no big deal. The chili was really good and the prices were decent. My biggest complaint is the burger. No flavor at all. It was absolutely terrible. It looked like a boiled frozen patty. It was really awful and bland. Fast food burgers are better than what I had. My son ordered  plain chicken wings and I wish I had done the same because I tried one and it was delicious! If I ever go back I'll stay away from the burgers. They have paper straws for their drinks which is probably better for the environment but also really gross feeling to use. Otherwise the place is dark and dingy but kinda of charming."}
{"text":"I try to come here whenever I'm visiting.  The food does seem like it got more food serviced than I remember, hence the sign at the table for their chili had US Foods branded along with it...disappointing.

They have the best beer battered onion rings I've ever had though and their fries are thicker hand-cut that are cooked properly(twice).  The fries are crispy out side and buttery inside.  
The burgers are still great for being cooked on a flat top grill, but I wish they used fresh cut mushrooms instead of canned ones.  They serve food until midnight which is a score for Richfield area."}
{"text":"Easily in my top five favorite bars. Frequented this place regularly when I worked in Richfield.  Willie always had the biggest smile and best service. I recommend this place to anyone in the area or surrounding area. They have all of the favorite beers and their food is delicious. Don't forget to say hi to Willie and check out the shirt he has on! Cheers."}
{"text":"It had been years since I visited but Whitey's has stood the test of time.  Great burgers, good apps....as always, great chili and french fries.  The core of the business is still a great bar environment but it does not discriminate at all against families, couples, groups, etc.  Very comfortable with good service.  

I'd still like to see more windows in the dining area but overall, a great local pick!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Went to have a beer and burger and it totally hit the spot. The place has a real friendly atmosphere and is just a great place to relax with a beer. The fries are really great too. Will definitely be back. Just remember to bring cash with you-- it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Chili flight!!! This is a great thing. 4 cups of chili to try, on a paddle with some cheese, onions, crackers, etc. Who wouldn't love this option. Have been here many times but this is the first time I did this food option. WTF!!! Why have I been that stupid to ignore this excellent option!"}
{"text":"Delicous burger and french fries, and the jalape√±o caps are delicious, only draw back is that pop is served by the can,and they only take cash or check"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and the burger was Delish along with the mushroom appetizer. Our server was quite attentive. Love this place !!"}
{"text":"We love the Maggie burger and the nachos!
Anyone who tells us that they have a good burger place we asked them if they have been to Whiteys bc there is nothing better!"}
{"text":"My parents have been bringing me here my whole life, even after the demise of the Coliseum. This place is so delicious and awesome. It just feels like the 1980's inside, but maybe that's just me hanging onto my childhood. 

You can't go wrong with a Maggie burger and Coliseum fries. My friend had the burger with the macaroni and cheese and have me a bite. Also incredible, but the Maggie is my staple."}
{"text":"Greasy, grey burger that drenched the bun. The chili was decent.  Dark, dingy, old-looking interior.  Waitress was not very attentive."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy dinner grab a drink or just hangout on the patio and watch volleyball. Fridays are the busiest and most fun for the Bar scene . The food is awesome-not too healthy but that's why it's good"}
{"text":"Whitey's is ok! If they had something special to offer I would be able to understand their lack of accepting a credit or debit card...but their food is really just so so! Probably will not go back again! There's a reason why they don't accept a credit card! Hmmmm!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy Friday night sat at the bar while waiting for our table to be ready and come to find out that it is a cash only place.  Bar staff was very rude about us not knowing it being cash only.  Would not recommend for family's or anyone else in the 21st century."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted by the lobster claw machine near the entrance of the restaurant. Will never be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Maggie Burger. There is always some to food to take home. The fries are homemade good.   The shrimp nite and wing nite is a great deal.  Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Town!
We routinely drive there from Cleveland. 
Chilly/taco pizza/bacon...on top of the burgers are allowed excellent!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to write up  a place we go every week. This is a real neighborhood bar. Loud, casual, very friendly service. So busy they have no reason to take credit cards. Food is comfort food for sure. Whitey's Chili is sold all over the USA. Their ribs are great and their burgers are among the best you've ever had. Hand cut fries, Steak sandwich, all good. Best seats are at the bar. This way you can talk with a unusual bartender,Willie.He always has a joke. Susan , Ann and Jack help Willie out when needed, or they're part of the table staff. Sand Volleyball outside in the summer, darts and block stacking inside. Great food, Great fun. A lot of regular customers. Large parking lot;. Most items are under $10.00 Safe place to bring kids, there is a seperate game room for them."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Whitey's my whole life. The burgers are mouthwatering. My favorite right now is the firecracker burger. The white chili is awesome as well. Service is normally fairly quick and attentive. Although there is one bartender that is usually always grumpy and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a burger and sides. Went here last night and a bacon cheeseburger and onion rings. HUGE PORTIONS!! The onion rings were delicious and the burger was pretty tasty. I really liked that none of the food was over greasy or too messy. My fianc√© mentioned that he liked the burger buns and that we didn't have to wait for a table around dinner time. We'll be back when we're looking for some burger yumminess and quick service!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. It seems nice and like we may have just had a bad experience. But the bar staff was extremely rude to us for not knowing it was a cash only establishment even after I ran to my car to get cash to pay for the drinks she seemed to have been burdened by making. Maybe we'll try it again later, but the bar staff didn't leave a great first impression."}
{"text":"Way, way in the past, before golden arches existed everywhere,  there were roadside taverns.  
Whiteys is a throwback to that time.  Nothing fancy or pretentious here.  
Decent beer selection,  well priced.  Very good burgers; about 10oz, by the looks of the patty.  Toppings will flow or onto the plate.  Excellent fries and onion rings. 
I did not try the chili,  maybe another day. 
Service friendly, but rather slow. Expect it will take 30 minutes for food to reach you.  That's a problem, in my opinion. 
I also wonder about the value proposition.  My burger was just under $10, dinner for 3 was $37. That's nearly Flip Side pricing."}
{"text":"One of our, my family and mine, favorite burger spots, but tonight we went for the fish fry. It's was DELISH!!!! Hot and crunchy fish, hush puppies were very tasty and the coleslaw was a pleasant surprise. I find most restaurants make or sell bland slaw, but this was very good. 
It was busy, but we were seated in a timely matter and the service was great!!!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. Ive been after work with my coworkers. The food is good and the drinks are cheap. I usually get a burger and the burgers are really good and huge. 

The service is okay, I've gotten an unfriendly bartender once. Service is sometimes slow because its usually crowded.  It's really nice atmosphere . There is volleyball in the back which is really fun (especially after a couple of drinks lol). I would definitely  recommend if in the Richfield area."}
{"text":"Outrageously slow. Long wait for table and even longer wait to order. From walking in to finish nearly three hours for very mediocre burgers of unidentified meat source. Must be resting on decades long reputation because it was packed but oh what a disappointment. Even worse, the manager totally shrugged off our complaint about the very slow, inattentive service."}
{"text":"Such a great meal, we really enjoyed the bomb burger and the chips with chili. The atmosphere is fun and the staff was nice. Would definitely recommend eating here. The price was nice, too! They also have a great drink selection."}
{"text":"Really tasty burger. Ambiance was not my cup of tea. A lobster claw game???  $3 claw game were you can grapple your own lobster and win a seafood dinner?  WTF, Ohio, WTF?"}
{"text":"Best bar in town. Been going for 20 years! Always friendly staff. Get the Maggie burger!!"}
{"text":"We had hamburgers and chili. They were excellent we really enjoyed the food. the waitress and service was excellent very quick and efficient. We definitely will come back and try something different."}
{"text":"Great food. The long time bar tender is a real card.  Great food. Limited beer selection but the ones they have are really good. Great happy hour deals.  And a great juke box Check out hayseed Dixie.  ;).   Nothing to complain about.  Check out this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Not as good as all the hype, kinda pricey. Almost $40.00 for 2 people- both has a burger, I had fires, she had onion rings, she had coffee, I had tea. Better deal at Red Robin. Really dark and dingy"}
{"text":"They have delicious, juicy burgers.  I ordered the \"Maggie\" burger and it was overflowing with saut√©ed mushrooms.  My wife had the \"Black and Blue\" and loved it.  You only need to order one french fries.  It comes overflowing with fries and is enough for three to four.  The decor is old and dated but that is what you expect from a bar setting.  The chili sampler was enough for four as an appetizer.  Love this place!!!  Remember though that this is a cash only establishment.  An ATM is located conveniently in the front."}
{"text":"20 years later, Whitey's is comfort food! 
I've been coming here for the majority of my life. Growing up in Bath, this place is a more of a staple than an Applebee's or a Friday's to me. The decor is a very humble, neighborhood-focused setting with a slightly 'wealthy trucker' feel to it. The staff is beyond friendly, while still working at an ever-constant fast pace. Plenty of seating in the dining room as well as at the bar. I'm not convinced they actually use the outdoor bar on the patio, but there is rarely a long wait to snag a drink from the main bar. 
The food is incredible, ranging from specialty burgers to chili to pizza. 
The one downside is that the restaurant is Cash Only, meaning if you happen to live in the present times, you'll need to stop at a bank or eat the service charge at the ATM inside the door. 
My only hope is that they improve their beer selection. They managed to find a spot for one of the most mediocre IPA's out there (Elevator Three Frogs), so that's at least something of an improvement, but outside of that and a possible Great Lakes tap or two, you'll have to settle for a cheap domestic."}
{"text":"Overrated glorified bar food. Frozen burger patties that you get from restaurant depot or Costco. Not worth coming here. Enough said."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are always huge, hot, and super tasty! Love the Firecracker burger, which has fried jalape√±os and pepper jack cheese. FYI, this place stays crowded and only accepts cash."}
{"text":"You'll like it here if you like being stranded on a Pirate Ship lost at sea.....the burgers squirt out of the non-toasted buns."}
{"text":"Drove down there for dinner one friday night.  The place was jumpin but we got a spot at the bar.  Servers deffinately wait on regulars first here.  We literally sat there for almost 10 minutes while the bartender dude stood 2 feet from us and carried on a full conversation with a couple next to us...T.M.I.  We had a burger..it was OK...needed salt.  Overall the place was decent but I wouldnt go out of my way to go again.  I guess that people that live out in the boonies dig this place so much due to lack of other choices.  Its not a chain or in a strip mall so I would guess its better on that aspect!  Right down the road is Techners...that place was way cozier and way more friendly..my kinda place!"}
{"text":"omg!!!!! Today is my birthday and I am visiting this area and was looking for a nice and yummy place to eat! THIS PLACE!! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! The service was great the food was delicious and HUGE portions!! The black and bleu burger was fantastic, the beef chili was so good, fries and the onion rings were hot and good!! .49 cent shrimp cocktails were a great bonus!!! If we lived around here this place would be our \"To go place\" If you are looking for a great meal go here!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky Im even giving this place one star. This is a total \"townie\" kind of place. If your not a regular the wait staff does not care to wait on you much at the bar. Noticed a bartender with his hand down the back of his pants while chatting with someone then preceded to open a beer with said hand. Food is either way to hot or way to cold, and the \"bowl\" of chili is not more than a glorified cup of chili. Will do my best to avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"Whitey's is great.  Friendly people and relaxed atmosphere. The burgers are amazing, and everything is served in huge portions. I wanted to be adventurous, so I tried the BOMB sandwich with chicken. (Thick piece of chicken, lots of bacon, topped with Mac n cheese on a pretzel bun)  I should have just went with the burger, because there wasn't too much flavor with the chicken and all of the other ingredients. Boyfriend had the Maggie and that looked amazing. We tried the Wings once, and those aren't too great."}
{"text":"No to go orders?!@$&? This place just wants to sell you booze while you wait 20-25 minutes for your burger and fries."}
{"text":"Food is tremendous, wish it wasnt cash only.  But I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This place was Cheers, just a different set up. The food was great-I had the appetizer nachos since it was late and I didn't want a full meal. However, what I didn't realize was that the appetizer nachos WAS an entire meal-lol! It was a huge mound of chips, melted cheese, chicken, onions, and black olives. I wish I would've 86ed the onions and olives, but \"somehow\" managed through them:) The toughest part of the whole experience was trying to know when it was appropriate to order-I tried to order with the bartender and he cut me off, saying \"I'll get your order in a minute.\" No one gives eye contact or any other social cue to let you know they're ready to take your order, so it's quite frustrating. But, hey-I got to go to a bar in Cleveland while the Cleveland Indians were in their first game of the MLB playoffs...and that made it all worth it:)"}
{"text":"The reviews are on spot , the burgers are unstoppable delicious . The spice#Secret in the meat is mouth watering. 
The bar itself is clean , very welcoming. The people were so friendly from the staff to the patrons. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat burgers, but I LOVE those. That's how good it is!"}
{"text":"My brother is a regular at Whitey's, so I met him up there on a weekday night. This place is super duper divey, so don't expect anything fancy. They were pretty crowded, with almost every table full. The person who sat us at our table barely even spoke to us. Our service continued on that route and was pretty terrible throughout our entire meal. The servers were trying to clean up and close down the dining area we were seated in well before their posted closing hours. We were in the middle of our meal, and they were talking unprofessionally in front of customers and were basically not attentive all of to the tables that dining. 

They have a bunch of specials for each day of the week. They had 47¬¢ hotzzarella sticks, and you have to order at least six for the special. They were spicy, greasy, and delicious. They are well-known for their chili and burgers, but I don't eat red meat. I ended up ordering the black and bleu with chicken because you can sub in chicken for any of the burgers. Sides, including fries, need to be ordered a la carte, so we just split a basket of fries with the whole table. My sandwich was good, but it was on the smaller side. 

Maybe I just don't get the hype about Whitey's because I don't eat burgers and chili, but I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went to Whitey's this evening and had a wonderful experience.  My daughter enjoyed the friendly servers and we enjoyed the fresh beer.  The burgers are to die for and the lobsters in the claw tank are the happiest that I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food here except the jalapeno poppers (those are delicious) because every time I come here it's to drink. The beers are super cheap and it's karaoke on Fridays.. you can't beat that. The talent that comes here is either REALLY bad (me) or awesome. Last time I was here there was a girl singing country songs and she was excellent. 

Anyways, every time I come here with my friends we get inappropriately drunk, sing obnoxiously and make friends with all the locals. The karaoke guy is super nice, one time he even ended up giving my one girl friend a Whitey's thong.. which we thought was hilarious (especially because it was red).

This place gets pretty hopping on Friday nights in the summer. People sit outside and some people play volleyball, it's actually really fun if you're into a dive-y kinda place. Also go there on Thursdays for a deal on the jalapeno poppers, they are glorious."}
{"text":"not a bad place but biggest issue they don't take credit cards... they only take cash and personal checks which is very strange. even some places I been to except square credit card processing and they could use that service for credit cards with no monthly service fees!!! the service wasn't that great. the waitress we had seemed to rush us to order rush us to eat and then rush us out the door. overall seemed very rushed. when we did finish the meal we had and then had to pay they said you pay at the bar.... what a joke I went to bar to pay sat there waving my money to pay for about 10mins before I had to yell for the barmaid and even tho she finally looked she gave me the 1 finger one second and she would be with us... I must say the food is ok not the best I have had better food at places similar to this. Gasoline Alley down the street is way better and if u don't mind waiting a bit longer for a table it's worth it. ... kinda sad that whiteys service and not excepting credit cards has ran this place down. I been here for poker runs and have always had great service.. I come there for dinner and totally different treatment. I most likely will not go back. I had the Mac n cheese with chilly on top it was very tasty my gf had a salad with shrimp she liked it but said the shrimp was salty big time. if they better their service and learn to except credit cards I would come back and try it again and change my review if they performed better. so overall it's only getting 2 stars from me and I eat at allot of places."}
{"text":"We've been going to whiteys for years. Food and service is always great. Haven't found a better burger yet. Bring cash!! It's the only downfall they only accept cash or check. Their Friday fish fry is a great deal and they have it all year. I love whiteys. It's our Friday night spot. Nice low key easy going place. Not for the city folk looking for a trendy spot."}
{"text":"I have been working in Richfield for the past 5 years and heard nothing but great things about Whitey's.  I finally decided to give them a try.

The atmosphere at Whitey's is typical of any other run of the mill sports bar, the food was ok.  I had a much raved about burger and (to me) it tasted reheated and was not very good at all.  The fries were also ok nothing great about them.  

The place was packed (on a Thursday night) great for them the service was reasonably fast for how busy they were and our waitress was nice.  They are Cash only which does suck although they do have an ATM on site it's annoying to have to shell out a service fee to get cash.

I do not see what the big draw to this place is and I don't think I have any reason to give them another visit."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this bar years ago for the Volleyball. Not much has changed since, and that's a good thing. A local joint, that has a lot of character, cheap beers and good bar food!"}
{"text":"The chili is the best I've tasted in NE Ohio. The burgers, however, are large but bland. The fries are one of my favorites. A long drive from Cleveland but convenient to Medina and Akron areas.
I have to comment on some of the confusing reviews here. Are these former customers who were banned from the bar or made enemies with the bartenders? In all seriousness, I've never found the servers to be cocky or rude. I mean, all restaurants have their attitude queens, whether male or female, but Whitey's is no worse than the average. People are bashing the burgers- I can understand, but what about the chili- this is what Whitey's is famous for? You can't pay with a credit card? This is your big problem? Stop whining and be honest people. You pissed off a bartender and now you want to trash the place. Whitey's is not a dive and is not trashy. Neither is it gourmet. It's just an all-American kind of beer and fried food place."}
{"text":"This will be brief: 

What Bryn R. said above expresses PERFECTLY. Live in the area, want to love Whitey's, but every time I try it I say NO MORE. THIS time I mean it."}
{"text":"I guess I should've paid more attention to these reviews before going.   Ample parking.  Dark interior.  The bartender seemed pleasant, but it's a shame we didn't get to interact with him other than when we payed our bill.  Our server seemed far from interested in customer service.   

Their sodas come in a can, which I may add wasn't listed on the menu (in fact, neither was the price).  Be sure to sip it, too because they'll never come by and ask if you'd like a refill or another drink.   One server looked directly at our table's empty glasses and walked away.

For a place that has \"burgers\" in the name, I was honestly expecting a quality burger.  Instead, it was a disgustingly pan-fried mess that arrived on my plate with a soggy bun.  (I knew I was in for a treat when the server never asked how I wanted to the meat cooked.)

Their french-fries are five bucks and are big enough for 2-3 people (again, nowhere stated on the menu).

Also be sure to have cash or check, because they don't take credit cards.

My friend had chicken wings that come with a dipping sauce on the side.   The breading tasted like the same oil that used to deep fry the seafood.

Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal pub grub -- especially the chili. The wait can be a bit long during peak times, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We tried a couple of different burgers and shared some fries.  Food came really fast and service was great.  Not really a fan of their burgers.  Patties did not seem grilled and the sesame seed bun was nothing to write home about.  For me, the bun should be much better.  Fries and burger embellishments were very good.  

On another occasion, had the fried jumbo shrimp dinner.  Although not really jumbo, it was quite good  and included fries and a generous side salad.

Service is fast and food is freshly cooked.

Bring cash... No credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Whitey's is a good place to get a real burger. They have all kinds of burgers to try and the beer is plentiful and cold. The fries are great and the chilli is good too. It's a big place that's always crowded.

Sometimes there's a seedy crowd of drunkards in the bar and you can always find junkers in the lot with those yellow I DRIVE DRUNK license plates. All these liquored-up air conditioner repairmen aren't assholes so it's safe, and everyone is friendly, but there's a feeling of sour booze-drenched desperation in the crowd.

To get to the restaurant, you walk through the bar. When you're done, you have to go to the bar, get a bartender, and pay your tab in cash. It's one of those hassles that is annoying to some people and no big deal to others. They have an ATM up front and if you don't have cash, you use a debit card or money card to get some. They don't warn you. Have cash or you'll leave grumpy.

Still, the food is better than average bar grub and if you consider yourself a burger lover you have to try it at least once. To me, the best burgers are the most basic ones they have. For instance, if you get the mushroom and swiss burger it's so big you eat it with a knife and fork. It's good but it's almost not even a burger anymore when the thing overflows and fills your plate. A regular Whitey's cheeseburger with everything on it is a really good burger.

If you remember the cash and have a few beers with dinner so you don't get annoyed trying to pay the bartender, you'll want to come back."}
{"text":"I sit alone at the bar nursing what has to be my fourteenth Hot Toddie and wonder how things could have gotten so out of hand. Alvin and the Chipmunks croon from unseen speakers in a nauseating falsetto that makes me wonder what kind of a God would curse me with these ears.

\"It's a Christmas time!\" A man in a turtleneck with a tomato red face shouts at the top of his lungs to nobody. He gesticulates wildly, ice cubes clinking in a glass, showering passers by with saliva and scotch, and then walks off in a drunk man's dance. Off into the night.

I catch my reflection in a mirrored Pabst Blue Ribbon sign. My eyes are glassy, bloodshot holes in my ruddy face, a face peppered in the small scabs one gets from falling headlong onto concrete. But this is not what disturbs me. What disturbs me is that I realize in roughly one month's time I have put on easily forty pounds and have transformed into a huge fat guy. The truth of this is laid bare for all to see, as I slouch heavily in my stool like a great, bloated hill.

A man next to me drinks noisily from a pint glass filled to the brim with tequila, one hand held under his chin lest even a single drop of the liquor should escape his greedy mouth. I salute him with a nod, as he is a kindred soul, stricken with the same yuletide fervor that burns in my own chest. Or at least I pray that it's yuletide fervor. At this point I've had so many damn Hot Toddies I think I have more honey in my body than blood.

\"I believe I have had enough, and would like to pay my bill, sir. If you have the time.\" I mean to say to the bartender, but instead the sounds that ooze from my lips articulate the words, \"So anyway, yeah. The Krampus is like a half guy half goat demon that'll take kids out of bed and drown the hell out of them if they don't help their mom out with chores or whatever. So. Y'know. Be on the lookout for that when you're going to sleep tonight.\"

The kid I'm talking to is pale with terror. I don't see any parents around. Who the hell was he there with?

I love this place. The burgers are top notch and they have all kinds of fun games to play. Believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Took the wife here for Sunday after Church pub grub.  After reading all the reviews, I was unsure what to expect... but not any longer!  We arrived right at 1:00 and were kindly greeted and seated.  The dining room began to fill almost immediately, and within 50 minutes was pretty full.  The draft beer was excellent, as one would expect from a tavern doing this much volume.

Lunch came in spurts, but it was perfect.  We started out sharing a cup of jalapeno bean less chili.  It was superb, both as chili and as appetizer.  I have never seen that much beef in chili before.  Sipping a tall Blue and real chili... made me feel I was back in Newfoundland! :)  Then our fries were up.  A big, big basket was way more than enough for two ol' folks to share.  (Note you get your fries when they are ready, so you get perfect fries.) They too were perfect and filling!  I wish I had gotten a bigger bowl of chili to dip them in.  In just a couple of minutes our burgers arrived.  I had the Maggie, and my wife the Czar.  WOW is all I can say! Mushrooms cascading off the plate, and more cheese than I have seen on any 5 burgers in the past.  

My wife is a beef carnivore and she went off the charts into beef bliss with her burger.  All I heard is \"We have to come back to this place.... munch munch... you think we can come during the week.... munch, munch and more yumming, and stealing more of the great fries.

Short story, we will be back.  It was perfect pub grub.  The wait staff were friendly, helpful and filled us in on the local color.  You won't go away thirsty or hungry.  As an ol' guy, I'm going to have to bring a container for next time and take some grub home, I was stuffed after this first visit.  

PS: My wife said the woman's restroom was spotless.  Things like that deserve a mention.  If this place were closer (we're 40 miles away) we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Whitey's again today with the family as we were taking a road trip around the farmland of Ohio.  We wanted to fill up our tanks before we went to Hinckley Lake.

Today, I ordered the Maggie burger w/ a side of chicken chili and onion rings.  My kids ordered a pepperoni pizza and fries.  My wife ordered the Outlander burger.

My chili was delivered first and it was very tasty.  I loved it!  It had nice chunks of tasty chicken, the right amount of spice (it had a little kick!), and it was just plain good.  Then the fries and onion rings arrived.  Those too, were really tasty.  I dipped my fries in the yummy malt vinegar that's on all the tables here.  The fries had the appearance, texture, and taste of being fresh cut.  The onion rings were served in a heaping mound.  They were pleasing to the eye and delicious to the pallet.  Nice and crunchy.  Yum!

Then our burgers arrived.  Mine was overflowing with onions and mushrooms.  It looked amazing!  It was cooked correctly (medium) and it was served on a soft, warm bun.  Totally satisfying!

The wife's bacon burger was really tasty too, but she almost couldn't finish it all.  The burgers come with a pickle that was also tasty.  We ended up bringing some leftover fries home because they give you so many!  With tip, our four meals came to $50.

Recommend if you're out this way.  In fact, I recommend making the trip all the way out to Whitey's if you've never visited."}
{"text":"We ate there on Sunday, June 28, 2015; got there at 6:30 p.m.  Waited in the bar for a table for close to 40 minutes.  That was fine.  When we were seated, we brought our almost empty beverages with us to the table.  The waitress never asked if we wanted refills.  Our order was not taken for well over 40 minutes.  When I inquired about the status of our order, the waitress was very rude and said they were busy.  Then when the order finally went in, we had to wait another 35 minutes, and then only got an order of fries in a paper container and no plates, since the waitress informed us they were out of clean plates!!!  By the time we got our burgers, we still did not have any beverages.  Terrible service, the burgers were only so-so.  Definitely not worth the wait or the rudeness of the staff, not to mention the fact it's cash only.  Yes, there is an ATM machine at the entrance, but when I tried to use it, it gave a service error and would not dispense cash.  Overall, a very dissatisfying experience."}
{"text":"Unless Misty May and Kerri Walsh are playing sand volleyball in the nude on Whitey's volleyball courts, I won't find me going back to Whitey's. 

Zero stars for you, Whitey. Zero stars.  

Why, why why...why do people love this place? You mention it, and people from all over NE Ohio get moist around the eyes and proclaim their undying devotion. I know it's an institution, but it's time for a reality check.

I live in Richfield, but have been boycotting this place for the past 5 years since their miserable CASH ONLY policy left me high and dry once (the bartender, with an accusational finger, pointing me towards the ATM.) Then recently, some friends from across town suggested a visit to Whitey's,  probably because it's the only notable landmark left in Richfield since the Coliseum vanished into prairie. So, I decided maybe it was time to give creepy old Whitey another shot.  

Regrettable..... let's break it down.

1) STAFF: The staff are smug and cocky. As if they have landed a dream job working in this shithole and that I should be somehow jealous and not demand too much of their attention, unless I'm a regular. We waited 20 minutes to place our order, and another 20 minutes to get our check after the plates were cleared. No apology offered.  

2) FOOD: It was the worst hamburger I've ever eaten. Worse than McDonalds. Greasy, overcooked, tasteless...it's origin as steak completed transformed into a colorless, flavorless, hideous gray mass. My wife ordered the grilled cheese, which was so inundated with butter as to render it almost inedible. It was like eating a stick of raw butter. Everyone at my table was thoroughly disgusted with their food...no-one finished. 

3) Are coming here for the ATMOSPHERE? I hope not. The dining areas are cramped and have about as much charm and appeal as a truck stop in Peoria. There's a random collection of uninteresting garage sale junk hanging from the already low ceiling in the bar area, enhancing your overall sense of trashiness. Trashy, with a side order of cramped and dark. This is Whitey's.

4) The beer selection is as mundane and low-end as possible. The Great Lakes seasonal was the only tolerable option on draft. If you gonna suck at everything else, at least give me some decent beer so I can get drunk enough to deal with my situation. 

5) Cash only. (I'm still bitter.)

6) The Whitey's Logo. A pissed-off, vampire-looking old white guy in a bowtie, who looks like he'd lynch you just as readily as he'd make you bowl of chili. 

Overall, it was about as pleasant of an experience as an emergency appendectomy. Done with this review. I'm going to return to thinking about something pleasant now. Like Kerri Walsh naked."}
{"text":"Those were some of the BEST burgers we have ever eaten - really.  And, the fries were pretty darn good too. The place was a little dated, which can be forgiven since it has been open since the 50s, and they only take cash, but the food and service was awesome, so I am still going with five stars."}
{"text":"I've had and been here many a time before I left Cleveland. It's not always bc of the food either. Service is good and we were regulars enough that they let us call in orders before the kitchen closed. Some people made view the staff as unfriendly but it is quite the opposite instead of just the fake niceness with a smile, some of them will joke around which may not be for everyone I guess. 

Burgers don't come with fries. However if you order them they are massive (like 2 people easy to split). Speaking of which I usually stick with burgers and burger of the month to try. If that doesn't sound appetizing at that time go with the firecracker. It is by far the next best thing if not the best. 

I even ordered a chili flight once, and I should have asked them which were which as some were great others average.

Their wings here are different too. They are dry (as in not a rub as in cooked just as a wing) and then you dip them into a sauce of your choosing.

Speaking of which ask them for I believe it is called Frank's or Dave's sauce. I can't remember the name as been a few months. One of the guys makes it there they will know what you are talking about. It isn't on the menu but goes amazing with the fries."}
{"text":"Oh man...one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE places to eat.  The burgers are AMAZING.  The Fries, Onion Rings and Fried Cauliflower are second to none.  The atmosphere is great.  It is Loud so prepare yourself.  Multiple TVs around the room.  You know you are in Cleveland when the Indians game is on and a HomeRun was hit and the whole place erupts in cheers.  It was awesome.  The whole room joined in for someone's birthday singing too!  If you are traveling on 271 or 77, it is well worth the little detour to hit this place.  WARNING...CASH ONLY!  There is an ATM but they only take cash...come prepared!   Every time I get to Cleveland I do all I can to get to Whitney's!"}
{"text":"My stoner friends from Kent State have been hyping this joint up for years. I finally got the chance to go on a beautiful spring day. Me and my friend discussed chemtrails and the big oil spill going on currently. The side salad was alright. I liked the interior and exterior of Whiteys. Just a normal bar/restaurant in the middle of the country. I enjoyed just driving down there to be honest. My friend claims they are the best restaurant style burger ever. I disagree. They are nice burgers, cooked nicely, not overcooked. My main gripe is they are cooked on a flat top. I like thick burgers flame grilled or broiled. I think some tavern burgers around town are better. I would love to go back to Whiteys as I really enjoyed the surroundings. Plus, they have my favorite pinball machine of all time. South Park! One of the easiest machines to master and it really takes me back to a simpler time of time of life when getting messed up and playing pinball was all that I cared about."}
{"text":"We came here after the Towpath Marathon in Cuyahoga Valley National Park because I have a tradition of eating a burger after every marathon that I run. It gets me through the last few miles knowing that a delicious burger is in my future. Because I was far from home, I had to rely on my local friends to figure out the best spot for this coveted post-race burger, and they did not lead me astray. 

I went with my standard burger order (LTO, extra pickles) and a side of the jalapeno caps with a pumpkin beer (I can't remember the brewery). The meal absolutely hit the spot, and I was impressed with the draft selection.

Yes, this place is a dive, but that's part of what makes it awesome. There is a lobster tank by the front door where you pay a couple quarters to use one of those mechanical hooks to try to grab a lobster. When we walked in, a little girl had just snagged one (I wish I had seen it!) and was peaking in through the trap door while her mom ran to get something to put the little guy in. I can honestly say, I have never seen that at a restaurant before.

The Browns-Steelers game was on while we were there, so the bar was packed and the crowd was lively.  I think I saw a bartender handing out free hot dogs! We were waiting for our table, and it took all of my will power not to bowl over someone on a bar stool to get to them (I was really hungry!). Despite the crowd, the service was prompt and friendly. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, and in need of a burger, I will be back at Whiteys."}
{"text":"It could be the booze talking, but the burgers here are pretty solid. 
I happened to come in for what I was hoping would be a quick dinner on a Saturday night, but was pretty shocked to see the parking lot jam packed when I pulled in. It's a pretty typical roadside bar, but much larger than I expected it to be inside. 
I was able to snag a spot at the bar, but the bartender was shorthanded and the bar was packed as well. Fortunately, he did his best to accommodate everyone, and as a server having been in that situation, I was all too eager to cut him a break. This place had more craft brews than I expected them too, nothing extravagant, but at least 9-10 different choices. 
The burgers themselves are huge- I kept it simple and just got a cheeseburger, but I can't imagine what some of the loaded ones would look like. Biting into this burger is pure heaven, especially if you are a little tipsy from the beer. It's a wonderfully juicy burger served on a super soft bun, and by the time you're finished eating it, your fingers are covered with greasy deliciousness. It's not the best burger I've had, but it's still pretty darn good. One downside is that the burgers are not served with fries, and a side of fries is a whopping $3.99 which is way too much for one person. The menu has a lot more than just burgers as well, but it's pretty clear that burgers are their main fare. Would recommend to those on the road passing through, or to any burger lovers out there!"}
