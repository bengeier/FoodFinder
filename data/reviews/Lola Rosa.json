{"text":"While visiting Montreal with a couple friends, this was one of those places that I discovered was an absolute gem. I'm mostly vegetarian, however I could sense the trepidation my  (carnivorous) friends had in going to a new city and a new restaurant, with a cuisine that -lets face it- can either be reeeally good, or reeeally bad. But let me tell you, everything was delicious! I had the quiche of the day with this great chickpea salad and some greens that has a bomb dressing. That might not sound very filling, but the portions were hearty. Everyone left the table happy, satisfied, and pleasantly surprised at how awesome vegetarian/vegan food is. (I told them so)  The style is very boho, with quaint little details that make it even more unique of a space. One being, if your table has little drawers...open them. One of my friends just had to snoop around and she was delightfully surprised to find little love notes. Over a pitcher of their red sangria, it was a great topic of conversation, and a perfect start to our Montreal adventure."}
{"text":"Came here one day for lunch while away on a girls weekend.   Service was wonderful, and very helpful and knowledgable about the food offered (seems logical, but I've been places where the servers don't know anything about the food they serve).   Prices were on point, especially for a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.   The food was delicious, and the portions are huge!   Very cute and quaint small restaurant. I would recommend checking it out if you are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"J'avoue que je suis toujours intriguée par les places végétariennes car je suis une vraie carnivore mais leur carte m'avait donné envie d'essayer. J'ai pris le demi Lola's nachos, c'était savoureux et la portion était gigantesque. Par contre les frites de pois chiches manquaient un peu de gout et la portion était assez petite pour le prix. En conclusion, une ambiance, des plats et des boissons sympas, des tarifs très corrects bref au final une très très bonne surprise"}
{"text":"Delicieux' delicious!  We had the nachos: big, tasty and a lot healthier than any nachos I've ever had! She had the ragou tunisien and loved it. Les nachos déchirent! Le ragoût tunisien défoncé! I had the quesadilla w sweet potato and avocado: Deeeliissh! Le quesadilla était très très bon pomme de terre douce et avocat!!! Le brownie wow.  Owned and operated by frenchies! Merci les gars!  Lots Of charm Charmant!  All tables have drawers where you will find messages people left, bring a pen!  We will be back  Rico, Merci mec!!! Eigil : PARIS, SF, NYC."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant and the food is delicious! It's got that sort of contemporary minimalist aesthetic with a \"natural\" spin (i.e., replace modernist white cube with wooden benches). It's not very personal, but it's pretty. It is a bit pricey, but not completely out of reach, and it feels worth it for a nice date since it is perfect for quiet conversation. Basically, it's all for special occasions (at least for my budget it is). The menu is not big, but it is jammed full of good things. The menu is clearly marked vis-a-vis vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. I highly recommend the risotto and the basil creme brulée will blow your mind (so save room for dessert!). I've had the same waitress both times I have been to this restaurant and she has been extremely lovely and helpful. Basically, this is a vegetarian dream boat of a spot. I've never been to the original Lola Rosa location, but this location is great."}
{"text":"We started with a demi portion nachos. For main dishes, we had curry, lasagna and burger. Generous portions and good quality. You don't feel it is a vegetarian restaurant at all. I am a meat lover but I left happy and full."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the McGill Ghetto location a decade ago, but times have changed. Service was slow - took so long to get drinks that we ordered our second round after we finally got our first drink - although we were a larger group (less than 10) so forgivable. However, one member of our group did not get her food until after everyone else was finished - not so forgivable.   The cocktails were the saving grace. The food was horrible. We had the cajun burger and it was hard and burnt and far from flavourful. Would not recommend. Plenty of better vegetarian options in this city."}
{"text":"I had ragout tunisien from here, which was so amazing I am trying to learn how to cook it. I've also ordered in vegetarian curry (with sweet potato, chickpeas, and tempeh) & poutine (sweet potato & potato mixed) from the other Lola Rosa location that does delivery.   The menu selection here is super creative and unlike any other place I've been. It's a vegetarian place and have dishes ranging from burrito to curry. I live in San Francisco, where there are many ethnic and creative food options, but I still crave food from Lola Rosa Cafe. Many nice restaurants in the bay area serve foods that are too complex in flavor. The place isn't very big, but as others have said tables have enough distance between tables for privacy. Both the food and the restaurant is very cozy and intimate, and place felt woody (if I'm remembering correctly). I didn't see it but my friend was wowed by their serving of coffee (not sure which kind) somebody else was having because of it's foamy top.  I wish there were more restaurants like Lola Rosa; unpretentious, serving homely, healthy food that's creative but cohesive and simple in overall taste/flavor. It's a place I'd feel comfortable trying different dishes on the menu, because every dish is uniquely Lola Rosa. It's a place you feel comfortable visiting often."}
{"text":"Couscous with Kafka was nice. Samosas were A+. Priced right. Service was warm and friendly. Cozy decor."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time we had. The place is buzzing with young energies. The helpings are sizeable. We were not too hungry so we chose a half share of nachos and when we saw the dish, we knew we had just ordered right. Did not miss any non-veg in the menu. Excellent service. Ended our meal with a brownie with ice cream and we found it awesome. Very reasonable prices make the experience 'value for money'.  On my 'must-do' list."}
{"text":"Vegetarian or not, your will love this place! They serve reinvented classics as well as unique vegetarian et vegan dishes.  I could pick randomnly anything on the menu and be happy!  The service is not always impeccable, but always very friendly!  I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"It's definitely overrated! It is always full, really loud and food takes ages to come. For me, it is not \"amazing\", it is just okay. They are kind of surfing on the trend to eat vegetarian food, but don't put that much effort in the actual food. I really feel like you could have better service and food someplace else."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went last night with lovely friends who live nearby. I am visiting from L.A. and always excited to try vegan friendly restaurants wherever I go. This restaurant is very cute and cool with orange/red decor and great artwork. I don't know if the artwork rotates but last night there were some large paintings of iconic rock stars. Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix were staring at us all night. We had a bottle of wine with dinner which included the quesadilla, tagine, vegi burger and green curry. I had the tagine which was absolutely delicous and flavorful! I loved all the spices in it and the green chutney that it was served with had the right amount of kick. For dessert I had the banana chocolate cake which was very rich and satisfying. Terrific place, great atmosphere, lovely service. I can't wait to go back before I go back home to L.A. Oh yes, we loved the little notes that we found in the drawers. We made sure to leave a message behind. :)"}
{"text":"I would do terrible, unspeakable things to have a plate of Lola Nachos right now."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a 5***** review; this one deserves it !  We came as a small group on the recomendation of a vegan friend of ours. We all ordered different dishes including the Nachos, Veggie burger, Salad, Poutine that are among the popular choices according to Yelp critics..  We also ordered iced coffee, wine and drinks and at the end we sprung for desserts depite being overfull already !  Everydish was delicious. Not just delicious but really very GOOD. Tatstes are balanced, well developed, from subtle to intense and cooking is perfect as is presentation.  Service by Vero (I think) was also perfect,  Note on the desserts...the crème brulée au basilic was true ARTISTRY!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere may be but the staff is very much NOT \"Kid Friendly.\"   We came at lunch with our daughter, were told there would be a 10 min. wait -- no big deal. Then they came over and said we would have to stand outside... In the snow and below freezing temps... With a 3 year old. There was room inside and our daughter was being well behaved. Beyond being inconsiderate, it made no sense. So we left.  I'm not someone who thinks we can take a toddler everywhere - but this place was listed as \"kid friendly\" and our daughter has eaten without incident in a lot of places MUCH nicer than this.  I encourage families to avoid and Yelp to reconsider the \"Kid Friendly\" label."}
{"text":"Very tasty vegetarian food with a lot of variety of dishes.  I ordered the veggie burger which was very tasty (and pretty heavy)"}
{"text":"Great selection of vegan options.  Came here for brunch and tried pancake with apple sausage.  Great environment and wondeful service.  My friend tried the nachos (big portion $ tasty), and vegan poutine.  Fresh and great flavour!"}
{"text":"Healthy and life affirming. This is the kind of place that I would go to again and again if I lived in Montreal.   Everything was tasty. Went there for dinner with a group of four. Ragout, curry dish, lasagna, and veggie burger were all awesome."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on the suggestion of our B&B. There's an eclectic decor with a good menu. We had the curry (vegan friendly) and the nachos (which can also be vegan friendly). Both were quite good. I was also pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of the avocados that came on the nachos."}
{"text":"This is a great vegetarian place in the ghetto.  I wish there were more like it.  It's especially lovely in the summer with the windows open. Good portions and great food (and I'm not vegetarian)."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday celebration as my partner is vegetarian (I am not) and we were not disappointed.   The food was excellent, and great value. We had the small poutine each to start and the spinach lasagne for a main. The poutine was bigger than we thought and as a result we both struggled to finish the lasagne. As a result we ordered deserts to go!  Service was excellence and value superb. Three courses and a bottle of wine - just under $100!  Cannot recommend more"}
{"text":"Wer auf sehr gutes vegetarisches frisches Essen steht ist hier genau richtig. Mitten im Studentenviertel gelegen ist dies ein sehr lebendiger Ort voller good vibrations. Zur Hauptessenszeit sehr laut aber das gute Essen entschädigt dies längst. Wir sind auf gut Glück hin, da wir leider zu spät für eine Reservierung waren und haben uns in der Schlange auf Position 3 befunden. Die Kellnerin war sehr gut organisiert, kümmerte sich super und kündigte uns eine Wartezeit von 20-30 Minuten an. Nach exakt 20 Minuten wurden wir platziert. Die Kellnerin, die für unsere Tisch verantwortlich war kam sofort um uns Wasser ein zu schenken und weitere Getränkewünsche entgegen zu nehmen. Sie haben eine gute Wein Auswahl und gezapftes Bier. Wir hatten die Tagessuppe und das Curry sowie den Tomatentarte. Das machte uns so satt, das leider kein Platz mehr für das Dessert blieb. Portionen groß und reichlich. Essen kam relativ schnell obwohl es extrem voll war. Gut gewürzt und alles frisch. Ganz wie wir es lieben. Service freundlich, schnell und kompetent.  Man muss sich klar sein, dass sich diese vegetarische Perle unter den Restaurants in einer ehemaligen Doppelgarage befindet. Coole Location."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian, but I went with someone who wasn't and they enjoyed it just as much as I did. Probably the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This is the type of place you walk by and think, \"Oh,I should try that someday!\" That is probably why it is so busy. It's in a great location, has a lovely interior and is bustling with students.  You have to know what to order to get a bang for your buck here.I made the mistake of ordering the lentil curry. Tasty, but nothing I couldn't have put together in 20 minutes at home. The portion was also quite small.  The one thing I can whole-heartily recommend on the menu is the TEMPEH BURGER! It was cooked and seasoned to perfection and was a sizable portion."}
{"text":"I went to Lola Rosa during brunch hour. The brunch menu was quite limited so I was happy to learn that it was also possible to order from their usual menu. The service was quick and the restaurant was rather quiet when we arrived.  I got half an order of the nachos they are famous for and my friends got the lasagna and the portobello. All three plates were good but the lasagna is what stood out for me. Topped with a mountain of deliciously melted cheese it was the best vegetarian lasagna I had ever tried.  We also ordered their trio of desserts which included a chocolate mousse, a cheesecake and a crème brûlée. All three are must tries.  The prices are fair and the portions are very filling. I would come again. 4/5"}
{"text":"Comme le dit le slogan \" le restaurant végétarien préfèré des non-végétarien\""}
{"text":"Really good food and well priced. Try the nachos for sure! They pushed a bit too much for us to get desert but that may have to do with the Dairy Queen right across the street."}
{"text":"I've been to Lola Rosa several times--well, I've been dragged there several times, to be honest--and I've never understood what all the fuss is about. I'm a huge fan of ultra-tasty vegetarian food, and this ain't it. Bland, bland, bland.  The ambiance is warm and inviting. I've always had competent, polite service. Noise level is reasonable. It's right in the heart of the McGill Ghetto, so it's often crowded with student groups--not a good place to try to seat any party larger than 4.  The problem is the food. I've had something different each time I've gone, and I've sampled bites from my companions' plates, and all of the food is unimpressive. Everything has always been cooked properly and served promptly, but that just makes it all the more apparent that this food has no flavor. It's precisely dishes like these that give vegetarian fare a bad name. It's filling enough, but it's just no fun to eat. Go to Aux Vivres instead, where they understand how to draw bold flavor out of vegetables."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa was a cozy but hip little vegetarian restaurant with an excellent menu. A well curated mix of dishes including Mexican flavours, salads, and comfort food. The staff was welcoming and knowledgable - nothing special but they answered any questions we had. They seemed to be going for a nonchalant atmosphere though, so it fit well. My party of three was able to relax and enjoy our food in a timely manner, which is all we could ask for.  I had a baked mac and cheese with a side of house salad. The Mac and cheese was great. They threw some spinach and sour cream in and used havarti cheese, which was creamy and rich. The potion size was not especially big, but it was a nice lunch size. The house salad added a bit of summer to the gloomy November afternoon, with sweet dressing and an orange garnish. My friends both got bean burritos with avacodo and loved them. My friend Jesse said it was in the top five burritos he'd ever had.  The table we sat at had little drawers full of notes from past customers. It was great to peek into some other people's lives after the meal :) Overall, I'd give Lola Rosa five black beans out of five. This was also the day before our friend Chris's birthday. What a great way to start the countdown to midnight!"}
{"text":"Great food. Bad service. Took a while for them to give us menus and food took longer than usual so be prepared to wait. Food is delicious. Can get really crowded/noisy at times."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Lola Rosa, I went there for the first time despite having lived really close to the place for more than 3 years. I got there a bit before noon, so I managed to avoid waiting outside and got a good seat.  I ordered the quiche of the day, but without the rice that comes with it. Even then the portion was adequate and filling, but the food itself was pretty average. The quiche crust was made of puff pastry that was somewhat dry and burnt, while the filling was tasteless and I could barely find the vegetables in it. The accompanying salad was not extraordinary either, just a mountain of shredded lettuce leaves and some dressing. I don't think it was worth the $15 I spent on food that day.  I was not impressed with the service, since the person who took our orders seemed to be in a hurry and rushed us through, despite the fact that the restaurant was not even full by then. Ironically, the food then took some 25 minutes to arrive.  I'm not sure if I'll check out their new location and try some other item on their menu, because I've been to better vegetarian restaurants in Montreal where the food was delicious and well-worth the price.  I'm really giving a 3 out of 5 because I think Lola Rosa Milton is a bit overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. My husband and I went last night and the food was exceptionally good. We got the petite poutine for an appetizer and it was delish. He got the burrito and I got the hemp burger for dinner. We both really enjoyed our meals. Our waiter, Michael, was super helpful letting us know what could be made vegan and how. They even have Daiya on thd menu as a cheese substitute which is awesome. The atmosphere was relaxed but really well put together, just what we needed at the end of a touristy day, and Michael had great suggestions for us for how to spend our last day in Montreal. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Best part of visiting Montreal. Ate at both locations. Food is unique, flavourful and priced reasonably. Sorry meat lovers, no meat. But food is so good you won't miss it. Will go back to Montreal to eat there. Their decor is off beat and carries touch of home eating. Our two picky eater daughters loved it. Excellent service."}
{"text":"We were starving in McGill's ghetto, lucky to find this gem.  Delicious homemade ice tea.  Vegetarian food that rocks.  The tomato tartine loaded with flavors tomato, olive, cheese, delicate buttery crust.  I am ruined"}
{"text":"What a reminder to not blindly rely on high Yelp ratings - Lola Rosa was an utter disappointment. We left regretting the money wasted, the calories wasted, and feeling icky about having eaten fried stuff that we didn't even enjoy.   Sunday afternoon, and the restaurant was filled mostly with families with astonishing numbers of children. Super noisy, but oh well.   The water tasted so heavily of chlorine, I doubt the restaurant has a water filter. When I refilled my boyfriend's glass from the water bottle I always carry along, I noticed a huge lipstick stain. My boyfriend said he had just been drinking from that side of the glass - gross! Note to bartender: spend less time slowly, slooowly filtering that precious Kombucha, and pay some attention to those menial tasks like washing glasses as well.  The food was one big disappointment. I had the Cajun Burger with smoked tomato relish and fried pickle. It comes with fries, which turned out a soggy, stale, lukewarm (at best) pile of the leftover bits at the bottom of a batch. The salad was a small handful of greens with a pinkish dressing that had no taste beyond being acidic. The burger itself was edible but utterly boring, the patty had zero crunch and it was a soft, tasteless mush that felt odd in my mouth and fell out of the bun in large chunks. My boyfriend had Lola's Poutine, which was a big pile of the old stale fries with a sauce that tasted heavily of cardamom and cumin - a heads up in the description would have been nice! The taste wasn't balanced, but overpowering. When the server came around to ask if everything was okay, we said no: the fries are soggy and old. She offered to check with the kitchen and came back with the statement \"they said that is our style of fries\". So the official statement is that Lola's fries are stale and lukewarm...  I'm all for simple comfort food done right, but our experience at Lola's screamed overall carelessness. Maybe it was that Sunday afternoon shift which nobody cares about, and from the loud cheering and hollering coming from the kitchen the crew was preoccupied watching the Olympics. We'll never find out, as most certainly we'll never set foot in the restaurant again and regretted ever trying it - waste of money and precious tummy real estate. ?We left in disbelief how far the gushing reviews and the reality of our visit were apart."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food with friendly service. Loved the burrito, the salsa was amazing."}
{"text":"A must-go place for everyone within the McGill bubble. The avocado quesadilla is my favourite selection at this quaint restaurant on Milton street. Lunch and dinner times are usually packed since the restaurant is quite small;however, they also deliver."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and I have no complaints. It's the favorite Lola Rosa (between the two locations) - maybe because the staff is amazing. I would suggest Lola Rosa to anyone - vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"Big, relatively healthy, and interesting (including beets and green beans) nachos. Also had the ragout tunisien and burrito. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5 stars  I ordered the burrito. The burrito and salad were both excellent - some of the best food I've had since arriving in Montreal. The rice was good, but not as flavorful as the other things on my plate. The service was okay (made me wait outside for my takeout which was sort of strange - the restaurant wasn't full) and the price came to about $15 which I don't think was totally reasonable for my meal. However, the food was so good that I think I can overlook that. Don't miss Lola Rosa!"}
{"text":"This is nothing more than a cantine for students. Food is decent but don't expect anything \"wouah\" but be prepared to wait, be unconfortable and finaly leave because you can't cope with the chaos anymore."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup le Lola Rosa, Surtout l'été avec la terrasse et un pichet de sangria en mangeant une Poutine et une salade César ! La Poutine est  délicieuse bien que différente des grosse Poutine dégoulinante de gras et de sauce que beaucoup de restaurant offre, elle a clairement gagné une place dans ma liste !"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I'm excited to go back. My girlfriend and I shared the large nacho platter, they are the best nachos in Montreal, I veganized them for 1$ more, they were just to die for. I really liked it here because it's a vegetarian/vegan restaurant serving fresh comfort food! The best part is you can get beer!! If I'm going to eat comfort food it's going to be nachos, they better be good and they better come with beer!:)"}
{"text":"Our daughter took us to Lola on our first night in Montreal. I have not had better vegetarian food. We had two different kinds of burritos, delicious local beers, and the polenta. We also had some spectacular dessert with chocolate that was to die for, but not from. As children of the 60's, we find Lola very comfortable, with its natural wood decor, buddhas on the walls, and low-key, pleasant atmosphere. Quite a variety of customers, which was nice--not all students by any means. We wish we had a place like this in Boston we could go to. We'll have to make even more visits to magical Montreal!"}
{"text":"Excellente salade César et belle ambiance. Souvent plein de gens, le service était excellent et la nourriture est arrivée rapidement !"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and I love EVERYTHING about Lola Rosa! The kale salad is divine and the vegan poutine is one of the best I've ever had ;) & love their daily fresh juices! Such a great spot, off the beaten path but worth it."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is more than just a \"vegetarian restaurant\" because I go all the time, and am not a vegetarian. The food it serves places it firmly at the top of all fast causal restaurants in Montreal. I have 3 important tips: #1 order the nachos, #2 get the salsa on the side (firstly because in the oven, the salsa makes the chips soggy and an important characteristic of nachos is how crunchy the chips are; secondly because you get a decently large bowl of salsa when asked to have it on the side, I believe more than would be used if you didn't get them on the side, and so can put as much as you want as you eat it), #3 order the nachos again. The Parc location puts corn, roasted bell peppers and guacamole on their nachos, which is different than the Milton location, which does not put corn, and has raw green peppers and sliced avocado. The crunchiness from the raw peppers on the Milton nachos is found similarly in the roasted corn, which also provides sweetness. Aside from the nachos, the sweet potato and black bean burrito is great, and comes with salad and rice on the side. A third dish I'd recommend is the lasagna with a Caesar salad on the side. They're great with refilling water. My only criticisms are that they typically charge for hot sauce, though, it isn't your typical Frank's or Tabasco, it's from the Asian food store Eden on Parc and one of the spiciest hot sauces served at a Montreal restaurant aside from the one served at 3 Amigos. Also, for \"pickup\" orders, they insist on charging a credit card on the phone (the Milton location allows you to pay when you pick up the food); this is probably from people ordering and not picking up the food, but I think is a policy that could be loosened, or conversely, have the Milton location also require the credit card for delivery as to not make one seem more accessible than the other. After your meal you won't even remember that they don't serve meat there."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Kind waitress. Generous portions; I couldn't finish my plate! Everyone was full and satisfied :)"}
{"text":"For the 3 days that we spent in Montreal, we made good memories over this holiday weekend until our last night here when we chose this so called \"Mexican place\". It came highly recommended and we had loved the restaurants that we had chosen so far. After a long walk, we finally came to this place and loved the decor. But we were surprised to read the menu which had nothing \"Mexican\" about it. It is a vegan place that has twisted Indian and Mexican dishes. The place did not have AC on that day but had their window shutters open. We still Accepted it since we did not care about AC that much until little bugs started flying all around us. After taking our order, the arrogant waitress came to us after about 15 minutes and informed us that they were out of Tacos. We did not care that much yet and some of us changed our order to burrito. We got 2 nacho plates for 2 tables but were surprised that the bugs were falling on those nachos and no one really had a problem with it. We then saw the waitress closing the shutter doors after which it became too hot in that room and still there were many bugs trapped in that so called restaurant which was almost as big as a \"one car garage\". While we were looking at this with disgust, the waitress came and announced that they ran out of chili and again asked us to change the order. We had so far been very impressed with Montreal hospitality and it was sad to end our good time with this (where bugs were being served with food that we were required to change our order three times). We had enough in the name of this vegan crap in addition to having this crap in the humidity of this dungeon!!!!   I then asked the waitress to bill me for what we all had been served so far and cancel our remaining order because it was hard to have a nice dining experience in a humid place with bugs flying all around and kids getting scared of then. But instead of being apologetic for our horrible experience, she told me, \" you will have to pay for it\". Again it was not about money but the experience of eating bugs that was bothering me. She then called her team and they all argued with me and told me repeatedly that they have already closed the shutters and We should be ok. She also told me that she has cancelled my order but I reminded her that my order was not cancelled but instead they did not have what many of us had ordered and we were being forced to eat what we did not want. I was also amazed to see that some servers were actually eating in the kitchen while they were also cooking and serving food in the dishes. In the end, I paid for everything and walked out because there was no point in trying to get them to see the meaning in all this . They still did not get what I was trying to convey. I am sure that there are many locals who feel that being vegan is being stylish but supporting this business where people are arrogant and unhygienic and where they treat tourists like \"one time customers\" is not cool."}
{"text":"Good food and decent portions, but the staff were visibly annoyed that we showed up without a reservation. Our party of three was told we could sit at the bar, then offered a table by the same hostess a few minutes later. We were also told 'We're so busy sorry we can't give you menus' and 'It's very busy we're out of water carafes' then supplied with both of these things not more than five minutes later. A little odd, but good food and a nice interior and patio."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is among my favourite restaurants. They brand themselves as the preferred vegetarian restaurant among non-vegeraians. And it's not hard to see why that's the case.  The service is excellent. Friendly staff are ready to serve in French or English, and are eager to explain lesser known vegetarian dishes to uninitiated omnivores."}
{"text":"It usually takes a lot for service to impress me, but the staff at Lola Rosa did it! I was craving nachos and I'd heard from a friend that Lola Rosa's nachos were amazing, so I decided to order a demi portion, which came out to $11.50. However, because Just Eat has a $15 minimum for delivery, I added a side of tempeh for $4.75 to top it off. When I got my order, I thought I'd good someone else's order by accident. There were two small bags of kale chips with smiley faces, a covered plate of nachos and another aluminum container labelled curry in big letters and smiley. I checked the receipt and it was my order alright. The staff were just kind enough to give me extra food!  Food wise though, I was less than impressed by the nachos. They're loaded with toppings but I think I'm biased though because I like felt like it was missing something as it was vegetarian (ground beef??) But I would recommend this place to vegan/vegetarian friends in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love Lola Rosa! By far and above the best place to eat in the McGill Ghetto! Although everything is vegetarian/vegan, meat eaters won't miss out on anything. The nachos are an incredibly generous portion size and absolutely delicious! The salads are extremely fresh tasting and the dressings refreshing! Haven't had a chance to try any soups or anything else, but will hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Soso food.Overpriced.Nice restaurant though.I was snapped at a couple of times."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, reasonable prices, great atmosphere and wonderful service. I highly recommend their desserts (particularly the trio for $9). It will melt in your mouth! :-)"}
{"text":"I had the best nachos and even better cheese cake here.  The cheese cake actually made me go back again.  Warm and cozy place with vegan and vegetarian options.  It gets pretty crowded in the evenings though."}
{"text":"I went to Lola Rosa this weekend with my family. We ordered a bunch of things, everything was as good as it gets! Would love to visit again"}
{"text":"Went there for a date night. Service was quick and food was amazing. I had samosas and the hemp burger. It was the best veggie burger I've ever had. Hands down. It's he middle of winter so I may not return right away but once spring arrives I will be back.   Oh the dessert was amazing. I had the banana chocolate pie.  Creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food , good service. We ordered burrito , nachos and quesadilla all food was delicious"}
{"text":"Visiting from the USA.  First time at Lola Rosa.  I am not vegetarian but after coming here, who needs meat.  Servers were super nice.  The environment was pleasantly alive but quaint."}
{"text":"Love this place! I only discovered it after graduating from McGill, but the basil crème brûlé is definitely worth a trip to the Ghetto!"}
{"text":"Food is good, had the hemp burger, enough to take to go. Cute that they let patrons leave notes behind in the drawer tables for you to read. Service is snails pace though so go way before you feel hungry."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Tried the famous hemp burger with chickpea fries. So so so very good! If I lived closer, I'd go constantly.  Service was great; friendly, efficient. Quaint and cozy atmosphere.  Only reason I won't give 5-stars is because I find it a biiiit pricey. Still worth it, however. Go eat that burger now!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner while visiting Montreal. Great place - small and cozy - excellent beer selections - friendly staff. I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"one of the best restaurants we have been to, and we are not vegeterians! we went twice, had 5 different main courses and 3 different deserts, all phenomenal. and it is clean, nice atmosphere, and great service by the owner. just go!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant. The menu is great and diverse, and is located very close to McGill. I really enjoyed eating here; however it is very popular and is often crowded. On the plus side, you can make reservations."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fantastic food. Everyone was pleased. They have a nice selection to choose from and are also very accommodating. The decor is stunning and very charming indeed. A must!"}
{"text":"You won't miss meat when you're eating at Lola Rosa!!!! Only disappointment was that there were no appetizers. The food is delicious and the restaurant is so comforting. Definitely worth a try, very reasonable prices (unless you start ordering drinks haha). Highly recommend ! Need to go back and try the nachos.  P.S. Don't forget to look in the draws of your table."}
{"text":"Allez savoir, est-ce mon côté enthousiaste qui frôle l'exagération marseillaise, le manque d'offre de cette qualité à Paris, où tout simplement l'endroit? Mais j'ai A-DO-Ré  Bon, par contre, my GOD, ce que c'est bruyant. Alors mes petits québécois, je vous adore, mais bordel! Entre l'accent et la voix hyper élevée des gens présents, on ne s'entendait plus :D   La carte: des choix trop canons, j'ai pris une soupe fantastique aux lentilles et une salade trop bonne. La table d'à côté avait choisi les nachos, les quantités étaient énormes... (et elles n'ont même pas pris de doggy bag en partant, je me serais bien dévouée, mais j'imagine que ce n'était pas très poli!)  Les filles sont adorables, la déco mi-asiatique, mi-bois brut -jviens du québec- j'aime la forêt est géniale  L'addition hyper légère Et le quartier près de McGill au top! On a fait une promenade jusque Mont Royal ensuite, c'était parfait.   MERCI ONCLE TOM, MERCI"}
{"text":"Cool little place for a not so quiet dinner so if that is your expectation you may consider searching for a different spot. The food was good and service friendly though it would be helpful if they confirmed whether an item that can be veganized should be. Would also be nice if they would ask if one would like vegan cheese where appropriate. Regulars might know but the newbie probably won't think to request it."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It'll stick in your mind and you'll want to come back. The decor, the food...ahhh...  Admittedly, it's not the cheapest lunch if you're a student on a budget looking to grab a bite. But trust me, you're paying for a satisfying meal. I've tried their burgers, nachos, and some sort of polenta-based dish, and enjoyed them all. Oooh, get dessert too. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Fantastic small cafe for health conscious and tasty vegetarian food. Service has been good sometimes, slow at other times. Menu's found on all the walls or they'll bring a clipboard over with it. Their salad is quite marvelous and makes for a good meal.  They offer beer, wine and will be a great spot in the McGill ghetto for years to come."}
{"text":"Had high expectation from the yelp reviews so visited for a 'Vegetarian' lunch. Well, they have an interesting menu, the place is a little cozy, hosts are welcoming and nice, working hard to manage the crowd. The food however, was not to my personal liking. I found the food bland and dry. Maybe it were the items that I ordered, but it seemed more of like 'non-vegetarian' recipe substituted with soy to make it vegetarian rather than a grounds-up vegetarian recipe."}
{"text":"Went here November 13th for brunch and had the WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE of my life. Shame because I used to love this restaurant but I haven't been back since.   Waited 40 minutes to get water. 1 hour after placing our order, an extremely rude male waiter told us the coffee machine was broken and so he couldn't fulfil my order. Would have been nice to know earlier! The rude waiter comes back 5 minutes later and tells us he ran out of the breakfast donuts my boyfriend ordered AN HOUR AGO. Nice to know they hadn't even started on our order after an hour.... The waiter asked if my boyfriend wanted to order something else but we were starving and not in the mood to wait another hour for them to start making our food. We said we were just going to leave and the waiter seem almost pleased as if this was his goal. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Burrito was solid and loved that it came with brown rice and salad (good balsamic vinagrette). A nice full plate! Food came super quick and the place itself was real nice! Got a table with a booth seat that had comfy pillows.  Totally going back!"}
{"text":"The nachos were amazing and so was the soup de jour! It has a very cozy atmosphere and is a good place to take a vegetarian on a date."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is a casual, tasty, gluten-free friendly restaurant right near McGill. When I go there to dine in, I am always satisfied and am especially a fan of the Salad Rosa. Sometimes, when I'm at work and didn't have time to bring lunch, I will get a salad to go. This is the only situation where I have kindof a grip with this place- you never know how much salad you're actually going to get! I usually order the full portion to go and sometimes it is filled with lettuce and other times (like today) it was more like a small scattering of mesclun at the bottom. I really do like Lola Rosa (esp nachos-yum!) but this inconsistency for a salad that is almost $14 after tax is pretty annoying. If I ordered a large salad, I want a large salad!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for vegetarians!! We ordered Tacos and Chile - both the specialities were just yumm!! Not just the food is delicious but they have a very nice presentation. We were so hungry and the food was so delicious that we couldn't even take food pictures. The food over here is very flavorful. We saw a lot of people ordered nachos so seemed like it is one of their top dishes. Service was great too! Overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"loved this vegetarian place! the portion is good and the food is very yummy! Really liked the blackbean and seitan burger and the quesadilla with avocado!  Their dessert is pretty amazing too! the gluten-free tiramisu one is delicious and soft! the mango and raspberry cheesecake is amazing too with very rich flavour  it gets crowded during weekday lunch around 12 if you don't have a reservation, make sure you call ahead to put your name down. the service gets a bit slow during lunch time just because it is completely full"}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is an absolutely delightful café. The service is good, the food is absolutely delicious and reasonably priced, and the little notes inside the table drawers are a fascinating and memorable touch. I'm already looking forward to going back here during my next trip to Montréal and I haven't even left the city yet this time!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive vegetarian food, this small restaurant may seem oddly located but it is very popular and you can expect lineup on evening. Tables and seats are very tight thus do not expect any privacy. I visited during summer and was seated next to the open window and it was very hot. The quesadilla was quite good, same for the chocolate ganache. A good place for vegans if you can arrive before 6pm."}
{"text":"Wonderful Strawberry Gazpacho, Veggie Lasagna and poutine. Wish we had more days to come back to try other dishes on the menu. Vibrant atmospheric and good staff."}
{"text":"I had the seaweed salad, and a nice glass of house pinot. The salad hit the spot as an entree. I had the key lime pie for dessert, which was solid. I'd go back when I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place as it was recommended by a vegetarian advocate but honestly the food just wasn't that great. I came twice, once with my girlfriend and once with a friend. The place is super cozy and quite homey.  I had the mac and cheese and the nachos the first time I came. The nachos were really good and the portion was enormous but the mac and cheese was very dry and bland. The second time I had the tacos, they were so bad I couldn't finish them. The tortillas were dry and the marinated seitan just not to my taste. Both times it felt like the food was put together very quickly. Definitely not worth waiting outside in the cold for."}
{"text":"Everything was sooooooooooo good!!  I ordered the poutine, the burger, the sweet potato ''pancake'' and the desserts and they were all amazing!  Only thing I was disappointed was to see the Dayia cheese in the poutine, it would be so awesome to have the ''squick-squick'' vegetal cheese (yes, there is one) on it. Also, there is vegetal sour cream too, too bad it wasn't offered at this restaurant.   It would improve a LOT our vegan experience by having the best ''fake'' replacements that exist, not only the Daiya."}
{"text":"By far the best lasagne I've had in my entire life, and I've had a lot of lasagne! Adorable,quaint and cozy place! The service is a bit on the slow side, but it is definitely worth the wait! Their nachos are absolutely delicious to start with, and the half-portion is WAY more than enough for two people. Could easily satisfy three people, you want to leave some room for the brownie after the lasagne also!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened since my last review (Change of administration? New cook?). We were there for brunch last weekend. We got our plates with half of the food not even warm for my husband and cold potatoes for me. My husband kept his plate and I told one of the girls about mine. She asked me if the potatoes were cold or lukewarm (what a question, they are not warm enough for a decent dish). She took my plate, brought me back my avocado toast and told me the potatoes were on their way. It took forever to get potatoes back to the point that we had to waive again at the other girl. I ended up with a plate of extra hot and dry potatoes. My husband told me that his potatoes were dry too and his dish quite boring. We don't think of going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased since I live in NYC where great Mexican and vegetarian food is plentiful, but this was not good Mexican. I got the burrito and my entire dish was covered in paprika...including the orange slice as garnish. All I could taste was paprika to the point it made me ill. It's all I could taste...for hours. The service was great and the place is cute, but very loud. It is in a college area so it's fine for college kids wanting to drink and have cheap food. Maybe I just got a bad plate since the other food reviews seem positive, which is why we went there in the first place."}
{"text":"This is vegetarian quirky perfection.  Crowded tables with earnest young people and only the occasional geezers like us.  Meal choices were wide ranging and just what the doctor ordered.  We had the chili and the quesadilla with a side salad. The salad had the best dressing that I've ever had. The chili had a mild sauciness.  The quesadilla had an excess of chunky avocado, but it didn't stop my wife from eating every morsel.  Rating based on genre--  if you want quiet, refined dining go elsewhere. If you don't mind lots of energy, with great food this is your place."}
{"text":"Vegetarian and Vegan full of flavor! Lola Rosa is great! Good service overall, a small menu but packed with healthy good options. Their dessert menu is so goo too, and their coffee is not bad. The place is always full, but the service moves fast, so even if you wait, it won't be for that long. Cool small place, earthy vibe, very nice and simple. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The large Nachos can make 3-4 people full. If you don't get the lasagna, you will have lasagna envy."}
{"text":"The perfect place for vegetarians to take their omnivore friends! Most of my friends are vegetarians, one is even vegan and gluten free, so Lola Rosa is always a safe bet.   I've been to Lola Rosa at this location at least 20x and have yet to be disappointed. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu and I have always been pleased.   The ambiance is lively but not overwhelming. Try to make a reservation ahead of time and a line generally builds around dinner time.   I would recommend the red sangria over the white/cider one!"}
{"text":"Les critiques de Yelp avaient mis la barre assez haute avant même qu'on ait mis le pied à l'intérieur du restaurant! C'est un petit café de quartier fort sympathique sur une rue qui ne fait pas de mine. La déco est très branchée et, comme les autres Yelpeurs ont dit, il y a es petits tiroirs à chaque table qui sont remplis à craquer de petits mots que les clients précédents ont écrit. Ça rend l'attente moins longue! Le service était super et on s'est senti bien accueillis. Par contre, le resto était plein et le bruit était trop envahissant à mon goût; c'était carrément cacophonique.  Nous avons pris des nachos en entrée (correct), j'ai pris un curry (bon, mais qui ressemblait étrangement à ce que je me fais à la maison) et mon copain a pris un burrito (bof). Pour dessert, nous avons pris une pointe de tarte banane/chocolat qui était excellente. Personnellement, j'ai trouvé que les plats étaient trop ordinaires. Je m'attends à un peu plus d'originalité quand je vais au resto. C'est la tarte qui a racheté le repas, même si c'était un service de trop: nous avons vraiment roulé hors du restaurant. Ce qui faisait changement des autres restos (et pas trop changement des repas à la maison) c'est que c'était assez santé: riz brun, légumineuses abondantes, légumes, etc.  C'était quand même assez bon pour qu'on y retourne deux semaines plus tard avec des amis pour la fête de mon chum. Cette fois j'ai pris la quesadilla (bonne) et lui la quiche du jour (légumes grillés, olives, fromage de chèvre) (bonne quoiqu'un peu trop salée). Nos amis ont pris le burrito (bof toujours!) et le burger au chanvre (excellent, surtout la sauce BBQ maison). Pour dessert, j'ai pris le gâteau au chocolat vegan (bon), mon copain a pris le brownie (excellent!!) et nos amis ont pris la tarte key lime (bonne) et la tarte aux bananes (excellente!).  En résumé, c'est un très sympathique petit restaurant, mais si vous êtes végétariens et que vous mangez bien à la maison, la cuisine n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus original!"}
{"text":"Great food, even for non-vegetarians.  I was with a vegetarian and went for her.  However, I would make a specific trip there regardless of the vegetarian menu.  Its near the university, so expect a college crowd.  As others have noted, its small and easy to miss.  But when you go in, it feels very homey.  A little crowded but it somehow ends up feeling intimate.  The food is vegetarian, which is somewhat difficult to find in Montreal, and tasty.  I had the burrito and nachos and didn't notice the lack of meat in either.  They were out of lasagna for the day (but it sounded incredible), and I overheard a couple people raving about the quesadillas.  A solid varied menu with many options.  One of the other reviewers said it was bland.  I was with someone who regularly dumps hot sauce on everything, and we both agreed it was great.  Coming from San Francisco, a city with plenty of vegetarian options; that's saying something.  From other revues, I suspect it was the owner who waited on us.  She was great, attentive, and very helpful.   And make sure you check the drawers in the tables for the notes.  Finally - the full order of nachos is enough for two.  Its a serious pile o' food."}
{"text":"Very cozy place, and well decorated. The last time I went there the service was not very fast and the quiche I ordered was slightly cold. It is indeed a great place to go with friends and to have conversation, the atmosphere is lovely."}
{"text":"I wenr there on Sunday but was very disappointed with the vegan choices.  Most plates were vegetarian with cheese or eggs. Nice location though. Kale and pineapple juice and chau tea were good. Not a real brunch option for me however."}
{"text":"Matcha cake with raspberry coulis and Pailin fruit chia whipped cream. Reason enough to come here. They have a nice vegan take on the burritos. I was pleasantly surprised with their home brewed kombucha. Light and refreshing."}
{"text":"If it were only based on what I ordered, I would have given this restaurant a 4 star. Unfortunately, my friend didn't have as good of an experience.   Overall: While this place is vegetarian, I'm really pleased to say that when I go there, I don't miss meat. The plates are so tasty and varied that I don't even realize meat isn't involved. This is a rare feat amongst vegetarian/vegan restaurants so props for that!   Atmosphere: great, not too loud, not too packed and yet pretty lively.   Cocktails: good variety, would recommend most of them!   Food: the best plates in my book are definitely the mac and cheese (for a delicious and homey feel) and the green curry (for a more refined experience in terms of flavours). The nachos are good and the half portion is surprisingly big (id even order it as an appetizer for a group!) The poutine however is quite disappointing in my opinion. This is what my friend ordered. First off, it got served and was cold. That's really bad for a poutine. She had to return it, they made her a new one and it was warm but the cheese was also cold and never melted. The sauce is so-so and over time gets kind of mushy. Not a fan of that plate. Seems like they have some hits and some misses so order wisely ;)"}
{"text":"If you have vegetarian friends, going out for someone's birthday, eating out, or any reason at all, you must try Lola Rosa! Think Mexican food but vegetarian. Their entire menu is vegetarian and they also have gluten free and vegan options! I have been here 5 times in the past 4 months and I have not regretted going back each time!  Their quesadillas and burritos are to die for. Remember to get the avocado (it costs extra, but it's so good!) and sit outside on their patio. Their inside seating is nice as well since they have big windows that they open that connect to the patio. The curry and Lola Rosa poutine with sweet potato and potato fries are also really good too!! The curry is a bit spicy, so if you don't like spicy food I would recommend you don't get this. Their desserts are also very good! I have tried the brownie and lemon pie and both were delicious! This is an absolute must try!  You can reserve through OpenTable!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a good restaurant that even non-vegetarians will like.  My husband and in-laws and I had lunch in Montréal at this restaurant and I was impressed.  The best thing was as non-vegetarians they too were very impressed too. The presentation of the food was good and the food was delicious.   Good service too!  Will be a place I would eat at again when I return to Montréal again for sure!!"}
{"text":"I am vegetarian and am very discerning about quality.  I was recommended this location (Lola has two locations).  I ordered the lasagna.  It was superb. Multi layers of different flavors includng spinach.  I went at their opening hour 11:30am so had my choice of tables.  WIthin 30 minutes the place was completely packed. so I suggest that you get there early or later than lunch else you won't find a table.  It is around 2 blocks from McGill University so that is why it was crowded.  They do have another location which is larger but I did not visit that one."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is charming beyond words and the food and service were both amazing! The nachos .... Wow! Small size was more than enough to share with my daughter! The notes in the drawers..... Touching, funny, sad, happy .... made me feel like we are all connected!"}
{"text":"What a hit! We heard good things about this place and, let me tell you, they were all true!  The service is fast and friendly.  The food is reasonably priced and tasty.  What more can you ask for as a hungry vegetarian?!  Perhaps an avocado garden, but that's a different dream...  Anyhow, my partner and I each ordered a salad and the chick pea fries to share.  I ordered the kale and quinoa salad which was wonderful.  Very fresh and not too heavy on the quinoa.  My partner got the Rosa salad which was equally as delicious!  Fresh veggies, yum yum yum.  The chick pea fries were also very tasty.  The waitress accidentally spilled some off the plate when delivering them to us - oops!  But she quickly apologized and all was forgiven.  It was one slippery plate so we couldn't blame her!  It came with a sauce that wasn't exactly ketchup but it was dark red with a dollop of mayo in the middle.  A very nice ketchup alternative!  In addition to our meals, my partner ordered a glass of sangria.  It was very strong, the brandy was quite pronounced.  This is probably a good thing for most people (like us!) but I have a few friends that can't hold their alcohol too well, this drink may have sent them over that tipsy edge.  The mother-daughter duo at the table next to us enjoyed a full pitcher of this zesty concoction!  I bet they had fun night afterward...   To be honest, when we first approached we thought it was a little dead for a place with such a good reputation.  As it turned out, all of the patio was reserved for a private event!  We saw many people, young and old, gathered at this fine venue to enjoy laughs, drinks, and most of all, fresh vegetarian grub.    Important to note, there were charging outlets near the table we sat at so my partner could charge his ever-dying iphone - he loves to check his feeds...  Unfortunately, we were too full to try any dessert but hopefully next time we can enjoy some sweet treats at the end of our meals.  Thanks Lola, or Rosa... whatever your name really is..."}
{"text":"This place has the ultimate vegetarian comfort food!  If you are looking for a super healthy meal, you might want to keep looking, but if you want vegan/vegetarian versions of all your favourites, this is definitely the place.  I have been here a few times now and have been impressed each time by the food, service and ambience. Plus, two people can easily eat for around $50 including a drink.   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun place with lots of character. As a vegetarian, I loved not having to worry about what was in each dish. Everything we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est délicieuse, rien à dire sur ça, le burritos vege + les cocktails, c'est tout simplement magnifique. Service rapide et courtois. J'aime bien le décor et l'ambiance, par contre, les serveurs nous ont demandé à 2-3 reprises si on finissait bientôt, car il y avait d'autres gens, du genre payez et partez rapidement, ce que je n'ai pas apprécié. Aucun parking."}
{"text":"Went back a few times but the best is the time I went with a Taiwanese couple who were skeptical about veg food. They loved it!!!!! And since they don't live far, they plan to return often. Great food and great service once again."}
{"text":"I hate vegetables and vegetarians, generally.   But the burrito, the hemp burger, and the vegan chocolate dessert were monster!!!! My gf is vegetarian and so I have to eat a lot of non-meat stuff. I can say in all honesty that this dinner was not only the single best veg meal I have ever had in my entire life, but it actually was better than a great many meat meals. And I cannot even convey how odd it is for me to see myself writing this. And 100% true!!! Frederick was a great server; excellent suggestions, including the red sangria! Yum! But I honestly think the ambience was the best part; the notes in the drawers made our trip to Montreal. Brilliant.   Coming back with our vegetarian daughter on Monday!!!  Love your restaurant!!   Seriously, great job!!!!"}
{"text":"La lasagne aux épinards est vraiment incroyable! Elle arrive brûlante et est servie avec une délicieuse salade césar. J'ai pris également la limonade maison mais je n'ai pas aime a cause de sa trop grande acidité, mais mon amie a adore. Le brownie est a tomber, il est fondant et  moelleux! La serveuse était adorable. Je reviendrai sans aucun doute :)"}
{"text":"I love going to vegetarian restaurants because it is so rare for me to have so many options on a menu. I came to Lola Rosa for a lunch date with my boyfriend, as it was recommended to him by a friend. The restaurant is quite cute, and in a nice area near McGill. We couldn't decide what to get, as everything looked and sounded amazing, and finally settled on a half portion of nachos and a mac & cheese. The nachos were AMAZING. covered in mozzarella, black beans, tomatoes, green onions, and some avocado and sour cream (I would have preferred more avo and sour cream, but that's a personal preference maybe). The mac & cheese was good, but not the best. We chose it because it was kind of cold outside, and we wanted some comfort food, and what better comfort food is there than mac and cheese? It just didn't have the richness or cheesiness that we were looking for, although the more I ate of it, the more I liked it, however I don't think I'd order it again.   A word to the wise: portions here are HUGE. We were really hungry going in, and left completely stuffed (and this is for two people who love to eat). Either come very hungry, or share with a friend. We saw someone order nachos, which were what we thought was the full portion, so were proud of ourselves for choosing the half portion. Turns out what we thought was the full was the half, and the full portion is MASSIVE.   I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in Montreal to try more things, and get the nachos again. The service was friendly, and prices are fair. We paid about 25 dollars for our meal."}
{"text":"now break bread  Memories of Montreal. Did you know the best empanadas come out of this city. Of course I had one. Still perfect. So I took a dozen to go. I posted them here on Yelp if you're an empanada fan...   Thanks to the sister's friend, Greenthumbs, I also ate at Lola Rosa. A vegetarian bistro in the plateau that I likely would not have found without him.    Lola Rosa is easily described as a non-vegetarian's favourite vegetarian restaurant. I am an insatiable and unforgiving carnivore and I liked this restaurant...surprisingly, a lot. They have the cutest terrace, and the service is warm and pleasant.  They don't have a big menu but it's diverse and almost everything can be made vegan or gluten-free. It's really well-priced and above all, it's delicious. My fellow carnivore Cracker loved it, as did our vegetarian, Piripiri.  Demi nachos - Colourful and tasty  Lasagna - everything on the plate - delightful - from the salad and vinaigrette to the spinach bechamel (at least that's what I think it was...)"}
{"text":"Une très belle végé-decouverte. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'association de saveurs originales associée à des produits de qualité et santé, n'hesitez pas tester ce restaurant! On a adoré les desserts qui sont fait par le ou la pâtissier-e du restaurant. Le service est aussi très bon, l'ambiance est calme, pas trop bruyante ce qui est vraiment agréable pour un tête à tête.  Il y a une carte d'alcool plutôt bien fournie avec vins, cocktails, bières et sangria... de quoi passer une belle soirée entre amis."}
{"text":"My father is in town and I thought it would be a great idea to let him try some vegetarian food. I ordered a burrito for him and a nacho (big one yessssss!) for myself. My father loved the burrito and of course I didn't finish my nacho. The quality was as good as before. The service is also slow as usual lol. But I still love it. I'm glad it's so close to McGill."}
{"text":"looooove the ambiance, staff is very friendly and chill, good food, rather large portions, kinda pricey. nice to indulge once in a while."}
{"text":"Always a solid option in the Mcgill ghetto, good salads and nachos, very hipster looking severs and decent prices."}
{"text":"I didnt like the quesadilla. The waiter was a little cold with me because i didn't know french. I still said \"merci\". My sister had the burrito, i tasted some from her. I didnt like that either. And what's with the decor? They randomly hung a statue of Buddha's head on the wall, that's disrespectful."}
{"text":"A nice place near McGill which offers generous portions and fills you up (even though there is no meat!). I had the chili and overall it had great flavor and the nachos complimented it very well, on top of being fresh and hot. I would have preferred a little bit more rice, because I felt that there were too many beans and the balance was slightly off. Will come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely.Love.This.Place.  Can I emphasize this anymore? Lovely atmosphere, waiters, and most importantly... FOOD. I'm not a vegetarian, but I absolutely loved the food! I've never felt better (or healthier?!) after devouring a full plate of nachos.   It's a great place to go with friends. Also, the tables have little drawers in them where people leave little notes. How is that not a great conversation starter/cute detail?!   If you go here, do yourself a favour and order the brownie for dessert. Your mind & taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"So heads up, there are 2 locations, and this one does not serve fries or the famous poutine you've probably heard about. That being said do not let that dissuade you from coming here as there are plenty of other things to drool over. I highly recommend the vegan burritos or the vegan curry. Oh and get dessert! The super friendly staff and delicious food choices will make you forget all about that poutine you most likely came for."}
{"text":"I've been to their original location on Milton dozens of times, so I thought I knew what to expect... The menu here is quite different from the other location, so much so that any of the dishes I normally order are all absent.  Gaveg the spinach lasagna a try... Mostly cheese, lacking and discernible texture, really needs garlic bread or something with crunch... Otherwise it's just mush.  Tasted OK, but the texture was a real turn off- wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"First place I've eaten in Montreal, I was surprised to see others reviewing the place as pricey; I'm guessing these people don't goto many other restaurants (especially veg* ones)  We came in an hour before the kitchen closed, place was packed and we still got seated and served quickly. Both the service and the food were good and I think we'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Lovely little vegetarian restaurant with nicer than average atmosphere considering it's a mostly student haunt.  Some of the items on the menu are good while others are a little more ho-hum but the service is consistently above average. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighbourhood and need a good vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lola Rosa gives vegetarian a good name. If you are not vegetarian , you wouldn't even know you are eating vegetarian . Everything was incredible tasty and our entire group of 5 people all raved about how good our meals were. Just look at this gorgeous table of food... and then mail me your favorite dish and a thank you note when you go (I am in the states... wishing I was now Canadian)."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent. I had the best meal of the group I was with. The Curry was pretty tasty, I've definitely had better though. My brother had the quesadilla which had a lack of texture in it. It felt very mushy. My sister tried the poutine, she could not finish it because she found it quite bland. The best part of this place is the service. Very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai reçu un diagnostic de maladie cliaque en décembre dernier, je dirais que je suis presque \" abonnée \" au Lola Rosa tellement j'y suis allée souvent. La succursale de la rue Parc, quoi que beaucoup plus grande que l'autre, est habituellement assez achalandée, alors pensez à réserver avant d'y aller.  Le Lola Rosa offre des plats végétariens, végétaliens et sans gluten à d'excellents prix. Tout est DÉLICIEUX et abordable. Il offre aussi une excellente poutine (qui n'est pas disponible sur Milton)! L'été, il faut absolument essayer l'une de leurs sangrias (et ai-je mentionné la poutine?). Elles sont vraiment bonnes et rafraichissantes.  J'ai noté la même lenteur du service que sur Milton (la raison de mes 4 étoiles). On peut attendre vraiment longtemps avant de recevoir le menu et des verres d'eau. Heureusement, on reçoit nos plats assez rapidement après les avoir commandés. Si vous êtes pressés, demandez la facture sans tarder, car ça peut être extrêmement long avant de la recevoir. Malgré tout, les employés sont super polis et sympathiques et n'hésitent pas à faires des recommandations.  P.-s. lls font aussi pour apporter!  P.p.-s. Une serveuse m'a dit que les frites de la poutine étaient cuites dans la même huile que les produits qui contiennent du gluten... Attention!"}
{"text":"A small gluten-free restaurant near McGill University.  Shared a half portion of their nachos  which has awesome dipping sauce & beans as well as a burrito.  It was delicious and a good amount for 2 people.   We had to wait about 10 minutes to get in and our waitress forgot to bring us an order because she was so busy but besides that had a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai reçu un diagnostic de maladie cliaque en décembre dernier, je dirais que je suis presque \" abonnée \" au Lola Rosa tellement j'y suis allée souvent. La succursale de la rue Milton est toujours bondée, alors pensez à réserver avant d'y aller.  Le Lola Rosa offre des plats végétariens, végétaliens et sans gluten. Tout est DÉLICIEUX (déception : ils n'offrent pas leur super poutine qui est pourtant disponible à la succursale sur Parc).   Seul petit hic : le service. C'est si long. On attend pour recevoir les menus, on attend pour que quelqu'un vienne prendre la commande, on attend longtemps pour recevoir les verres (mais heureusement les plats arrivent rapidement). Certains employés ont un peu l'air blasés, mais les autres sont hyper sympathiques, n'hésitent pas à faire des recommandations, etc., ce qui est génial pour ceux qui n'arrivent pas à choisir.  Ah, j'allais oublier. Ils font pour emporter!"}
{"text":"Amazing veggie (bean) burger. Great menu. Wonderful beer selection. Very friendly atmosphere and wait staff. Hope to go back some day."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place enough! As a McGill student, I've had dinner here countless times. The food is fantastic (I love the nachos and the quesadilla) and the drinks are good too (their white sangria is amazing). The staff is awesome- everyone is super friendly even when it's crazy busy. (Also- check inside the drawers at the table- people leave little notes and drawings in there!)"}
{"text":"As they say its the best vegetarian place for non-vegetarian. Food is awesome and reasonably priced. Hempburger,  Lasagna and Curry are must to try :) Their selection of wine is also not bad but I feel the cocktails in another branch at Parc is best."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was ok! Mac n cheese is a must! Super tasty. The burrito was very bean heavy. Quesadilla with sweet potatoes was so good!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant.  It was truly exceptional vegetarian food - so many people turn up their noses when they hear the word \"vegetarian,\" but this place would change that in an instant.  We shared the burrito and a half order of nachos - the burrito was just spicy enough and was filled with black beans, cheese, and a terrific sauce.  It was accompanied with rice and a salad.  The nachos were delicious and a half serving was more than enough for two people.  The nachos were covered with a wonderful mixture of black beans, corn, chopped tomatoes, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and special salsa. The chips were crispy and not overly salty.  We were given a carafe of water to start, which was refilled promptly.  Our waiter was informative, friendly, and efficient.  If I had to say one thing negative about Lola Rosa on Parc is that it was a bit noisy, but certainly not enough to keep us from returning."}
{"text":"What to get: Lola's nachos Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: Casual, trendy, dine in Wait: 45 mins (Thursday 8PM for 2)  The Experience: After stalking the menu online for hours, I had high expectations of this place when we finally traveled to Montreal. I was traveling with my bff who is vegetarian, so the trip had to consist of some tasty and interesting vegetarian options. Lola Rosa's did not disappoint.  I dunno why we thought this, but we winged it and just walked there without a reservation. It was quite the wait for dinner and I'm glad we stuck through it for almost an hour. The place is in a neighborhood and is a revamped garage (kinda). Hipster, trendy, or what have you, this place is packed with young to middle-aged trendsetters.  Tonight we indulged in sangria, the heaping Lola's nachos, and quesadillas. The nachos were the highlight. Beautifully constructed mound of fresh ingredients, you'd be a fool not to get this. Very filling to share for two. As for the quesadilla, it wasn't the most memorable, but it helped make the meal along with the nachos. My bff and I left the restaurant stuffed and happy.  Final verdict: If you're a vegetarian in Montreal, this is one of the best spots. A little different from what you normally get as 'vegetarian,' there's a reason why this place is so crowded and busy."}
{"text":"Le resto est toujours plein et ca se comprend. J'ai goûté aux nachos. Une assiette généreuse, je vous recommande la demi-portion. Un choix de bière assez intéressant.  Le service est rapide pour un restaurant rempli. Les prix sont raisonnables. La déco est franchement intéressante. On retrouve des tiroirs où les gens laissent des papiers. Ca donne des sujets de conversation intéressants.  Bref, j'y retourne"}
{"text":"This was such a cute place, super small and crammed but that's just part of the vibe. The food was pretty delicious I was really happy with what I got. I got the seitan & black bean burger (vegan) which was really good I loved the bread that it came with. The salad on the side was bomb also. My boyfriend got the spicy mac and cheese and he loved it. Both dishes were really filling and we thought it was pretty cheap. I wish I didn't live five hours away from this place!"}
{"text":"Redemption at Lola Rosa Park!!   I went to this restaurant after being invited by the owner (he provided an offer I couldn't refuse) to try this establishment out for a third time.   As a starter, I ordered, once again, the Portobello mushroom which was great. It was exactly how I remembered it the first time... Delicious! The only small negative comment about the dish would be the small salad that came with the said mushroom; it lacked dressing which really didn't bother me for the sole reason that my main dish was a large Rosa salad.   That Rosa salad was Huge in all aspects. Never have I ever enjoyed a salad like that before. And the best part of this salad... The price; about 15$. I highly recommend! Seriously, don't think twice, just order it.   As stated in my last review, my biggest disappointment was the service but not this time.   I was seated instantly, the waiter passed by several times to take our orders or to check up on the table. The food was placed on our table within a responsible delay. Great improvement and on point.  In conclusion, I would go back again, especially for that Rosa salad.   Thanks Pascal H. of Lola Rosa Park!"}
{"text":"I get so excited when I come across a menu where I would be thrilled to order just about anything offered. I went with the hemp burger, since it was recommended by other Yelpers, and it didn't disappoint. I also like how the portions were reasonable; I finished everything and felt nicely satisfied instead of overstuffed. One interesting note is that they charge for their in-house hot sauce. It was nice and strong, but I felt weird paying for a tiny little saucer of hot sauce."}
{"text":"I really liked Lola Rosa. I found it on a map when I was searching for vegetarian food downtown.   I had the spinach lasagna and it was pretty good. It had lots of cheese and it was very satisfying. My server warned me that it would be about 20 minutes for this, which was fine.  The service was great. Beer list was just okay. I probably wouldn't come back to this location and would go to their Parc location next time to avoid a bunch of students.  Prices were higher than at most of the places I ate in Montreal. I would come here again but not regularly."}
{"text":"The feel of this place is so serene. I loved the veggie patties. The whole menu is very unique and is a nice alternative to mass-produced vegetarian food you get almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch and loved it. I had the quiche du jour, which came with a salad, and the white wine sangria. They both exceeded my expectations. I often find vegetarian food too bland, but that wasn't the case here. My friends shared the chevre salad and the pistachio muffin and it was very good too. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from Los Angeles and looked for a vegetarian restaurant downtown. Found Lola Rosa on Yelp! and the ratings r true! Great place, nice atmosphere, good prices, delicious food."}
{"text":"A very racist place. I and my husband went for lunch and we were sharing a table with a very nice French couple visiting from France. They and we placed the order at the same time. They got their drinks and food within a reasonable time but I and my husband kept waiting for a very long time. Finally I caught the eye of a server and indicated that we were still waiting and had not been served even our drinks. The excuse was that my drink was rather complicated. They did not even bother to get beer for my husband. Finally the drinks were served and again no sign of our food. Now the French couple sharing our table also felt something was wrong. Eventually I got up and spoke to the manager and told that her we were being given a very racist treatment.  She of course denied that and later told me that there was some confusion about the entree ordered by the couple sharing our table because of which our food got delayed. That didn't make much sense. To top it the drink and food were nothing to go crazy about. Very poor show."}
{"text":"This was a tough one. We arrived a bit after 1 (to avoid the lunch hour rush). There was a large group taking up 8 tables (and there are only like 20) that apparently had finished 20 minutes earlier but were lingering. For a long time. We get seated close to 1:30. The waiter was quite apologetic and did try to hustle our order in. We had picked the place for the veggie options. My tofu curry was quite tasty. Hubby's veggie chili was ok... but didn't sit well with him at all... for the next several hours. For someone who loves dessert, the Twix pie was just ok. Super rich. I did love my sangria - but beware the cranberries - they were rock hard frozen."}
{"text":"While a non-vegetarian, I can appreciate good vegetarian food and this restaurant has some. My daughter had the coconut, broccoli with dill soup and loved it; I had the hemp burger and found it wholly satisfying and tasty. The chick pea fries were interesting but a but tasteless like eating puffed air. The half nachos starter was excellent and quite substantial. Good though small beer list (I had the local Alchemiste IPA and liked its bitter hoppiness). The Mac and Cheese was a little disappointing-didn't think the artichoke hearts really worked. Needed more cheese, and a bit of cream would not have hurt. The poutine started out looking good but quickly ended up looking like brown mush-more crispiness needed in the fries.  Service was cheerful but hodge podge, meals coming out at different times (though we were a large group). Pretty long wait before first drinks were brought out. No salt or pepper on the tables (and some of the dishes could have used some salt).   The atmosphere was young. Probably perfect for the college/University vegetarian crowd."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Lola Rosa, and I didn't have the best experience. I had their Seitan and Black Beans Burger, and it tasted burnt and really salty. The salad that came with it was really great though, I could tell that the dressing was homemade and it complemented the salad really well! I realised that many Yelp reviews were on the hemp burger so perhaps I'll go back to try that again! I'm agrophobic and phonophobic, so it was not the best idea to go around 12/1pm. It was extremely loud and the place was really packed. (But obviously me being stressed out isn't their fault, but it was loud to the extent that even my friend who doesn't have agrophobia and phonophobia noticed how loud and noisy it was in there.) Overall, I didn't have a great experience, but I'm hoping to go back there and to be proven otherwise. I have high hopes, especially reading all the other amazing reviews!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan, so I'm always looking for great inclusive restaurants where I can go with my family so we all have a meal we enjoy, and Lola Rosa is a great Montreal location to do just that.    To start, the service was incredible!  All of the servers were so nice and spoke great French and English to serve most customers.  The restaurant itself had a lovely atmosphere and was great shelter from the freezing cold!  The menu is chock-full of vegan and vegetarian options with a load of choices for any palate.    For appetizers we got the vegan nachos and vegan samosas, which were both incredible.  The samosas were the favorite, but the nachos were definitely a hit as well.  For a meal, I got the curry which was delicious.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it without being too hot.  My dad got the hemp burger, which had cheese on it so I couldn't try it, but he thought it was fantastic as well.  Other meals that were ordered included the mac and cheese and the burrito, which were also hits among the family!  We also got a slice of their new Twix cake for dessert which was also fantastic.  I'd definitely go back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Loved it! So cozy and when we went, it was very busy. Luckily we did get a table. The wait staff has great energy and they all seemed happy to be there, and happy to treat their guests to food they are passionate about. The menu is fool proof - try something different! You cannot go wrong and we were all thrilled with our food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The burrito, nachos, and tomato pie are amazing! Everyone must try this place! I will make sure to come here every time I visit."}
{"text":"This place is quite good for a vegetarian restaurant (as an omnivore reviewer) But it certainly isn't, on average with all cuisine, better than 3 stars.  Tried a few things on the menu and the most memorable thing about this place was the nice service.  Pretty meh.  Convenient place in the McGill ghetto but you can do better in terms of food in general"}
{"text":"Get that nachos. Have a drink. If you have room for dessert, go for it. This place is usually packed and for good reason! Everything is delicious! The atmosphere is relaxed; it'ssmall and charming. The service is great as well. This place is a gem that's been nestled in the McGill ghetto for years. Hopefully it will be here for years to come!"}
{"text":"I normally dont write reviews but...i tried a couple weeks to come too this resto for lunch Google map it, sends me 3o minutes the wrong way to pie x. Called the resto they said they would rectify but wasnt a big deal. Never made it there for lunch ill try another time. Tried going tonite and no one at door to greet. Finally someone came and asked table or bar i said table wpuld be alright. while taking me into the resto the girl realizes no tables available so i sit at the bar. Ten minutes plus later no one takes my order for a drink or food. Girl comes by apologizes i say im about to walk and i do. Poor service never going back. Cant comment on the food never tried. Wasted time and effort."}
{"text":"So good! Delicious food, friendly staff, and great music playing overhead, loud enough to hear but not too loud to talk over - what more can you ask for?  Dropped by Lola Rosa today after finding it on Montreal's top 10 best vegetarian spots on the Montreal Local Tours website, and it lived up to it's description to say the least.   My friend and I shared the poutine appetizer, the Tunisian stew, and the jalapeño mac-n-cheese. YUM!   They were out of the tacos, today, so guess that means I'll just have to go back later this week!"}
{"text":"The hemp burger was amazing. I had one of those rare \"omigod is this meat\" moments because it looked like a \"real\" burger patty and tasted far too good to be made of humble ingredients like hemp, lentils and tofu. Next to the burger sat a generous side salad with chickpeas. Call me a happy camper!   Before the aforementioned amazing burger arrived, I forgot that I had to wait 40 mins to get a table for dinner on a Saturday night (word to the wise: it is busy!!) by whiling away the time reading the curious, cute and downright deep notes tucked away in the drawers at each table. I was enamoured enough to write my own. (Sorry I had to hijack the back of somebody else's!)  Lola Rosa has a pretty cool atmosphere, is perfect for veggie comfort, and has charm to spare."}
{"text":"J'adore ce joli petit resto végé. Il est plein chaque fois que j'y vais, mais vu la petitesse de l'endroit ce n'est pas trop bruyant.  Je prends le plat de Curry qui est un mélange de patates douces, pois chiches, tofu, raisins et lait de coco, avec du riz. Juste un peu piquant et délicieux!   Accompagné d'une bière issue de microbrasserie du Québec, vous allez passer un bon moment!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal and my cousin took me to this place for dinner. We had a reservation for 7:30, and from what I experienced you're going to want one if you want to be seated right when you arrive. The place seemed to have just filled up with the dinner rush, there were a couple of groups outside waiting to be seated. Since we were only two people and had a reservation, we were seated right away. The ambience of this place is really cool, they have drawers at every table that are filled with notes from past customers. It's definitely a form of entertainment, waiting for your food and reading whatever random thoughts people wanted to write down. I'm not a huge fan of vegetables, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered the spinach lasagna because it seemed like a safe choice, and I actually enjoyed my meal. It is a huge slice though, I ended up having to take it home to finish later. Overall enjoyed my experience here, service was great, vibe was awesome, and food was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after a morning workshop at McGill new residence hall before heading back to work.  It was fun to wander around the student ghetto and relive vague memories of being drunk a lot in the early 1990's.  Not too much has changed since then... but Lola Rosa is definitely a great new addition.  Wish it had been there in my day.  Great vegetarian menu with lots of vegan options.  I had the Tunisian ragout, very tasty and filling with just a little bit of heat.    It's a cute little spot, with quick friendly service.  I'd definitely come back or try one of its other two locations when in the neighbourhood.    I do kinda think that they totally stole their logo from Depeche Mode's Violator album cover."}
{"text":"Je viens ici depuis plus de 5 ans et le plaisir des papilles est toujours au rendez vous!!!  Ce soir Curry à la mangue + entrée de poutine + une blanche Alchimiste.  Tellement confort food !!!!  Un incontournable à Montréal :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, atmosphere and service! The nachos are unreal. The hemp burger was something new and so delicious. Get a reservation because there was a line. And for a good reason!  Fun fact: the drawers in the tables have little letters! So cute!"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian food. We stopped in after a hike through Mont Royal park. The food was nice. We had very nice mixed green salads although the avocado was partly brown and black. The curried vegetable soups was thick and tasty. The quesadilla was filled with brown and black avocado chunks. It was a good lunch but not a great lunch."}
{"text":"Yum! This was our daily go-to dinner spot during a trip to Montreal. The food was for the most part delicious and fresh. The curry was my favourite--great mix of flavours. We had the 1/2 nacho plate as an appetizer each day (enough for two people). The tacos and burrito were also great. The veggie burger was less of a hit but overall a great dining experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I definitely prefer this spacious location to the tiny one on Milton. Everything on their menu is impressive, especially considering its vegetarian. I like their poutine best and have tried everything from their gigantic nachos to their curry. You can go wrong with Lola Rosa, especially if you come to this location. Good service, good lighting, good food."}
{"text":"Holy freaking cramped. So the Milton location is pretty much always full and loud af. However, the staff keep their cool and the food is great :) I rather make the detour to hit their other location, but the Milton spot holds their own and never disappoints."}
{"text":"I love love love Lola rosa. I don't go as often as I wish I did.   I've tried most things on their menu (poutine, salad, nachos, Cajun burger, etc) and I've loved everything. I think they do such a good job at making the food taste and look good and it's healthy. The Poutine has a base sauce made with mushrooms but I honestly couldn't taste the mushroom. It tasted really close to gravy to me. The nachos are insane. They add so many ingredients together and it works! I would suggest getting them as a shared entree.   It's different from the other vegan/vegetarian places I've tried because it's a much more relaxed place. It's not ultra trendy or fancy. It's super casual.   I obviously recommend this place a lot :)"}
{"text":"When searching for a restaurant to try on Taste MTL's website, I was looking for something reasonable (the $19 three-course meal) and highly acclaimed by internet food critics. On Yelp, Lola Rosa received four out of five stars, while on Urban Spoon it received a 91% positive response.   Lola Rosa is a cute vegetarian restaurant located in the Mile End neighbourhood. The atmosphere was warm and reminiscent of the cozy fall season. Most of the furniture was made from wood, contrasted with deep orange and crimson red decor. Bookshelves were placed throughout the restaurant, and glass milk jugs were used to serve water.   For appetizers, I ordered the small Rosa salad, and my friend ordered the tomato soup. The Rosa salad was a delightful surprise of various flavours. Goat cheese, beans and freshly sliced fruits and veggies were coated with a light maple balsamic dressing. However, I did not realize the main course was also accompanied by a salad (not as decorative or exciting as the Rosa), so I should have gone with the soup. The soup was made from brown basmati rice. The maple definitely added richness.  I chose a tartlet for my main course. My friend and I swapped half of our meal in order to get a more diverse experience. She ordered the quesadilla. Both dishes were accompanied with a side of salad and brown rice. They acted as fillers, and were bland addition. Unfortunately, the tartlet tasted like wasabi had been smeared onto it--must've been the mustard seeds. I tried to be adventurous and dig into the beets, parsnip, confit shallots and maple Chantilly tartlet. The best part was the crispy tart, with everything else scraped off.   While I found the tartlet too powerful, the quesadilla did not do much for my taste buds.  There was no trace of satisfying, melted cheese between the crispy tortillas. It contained sweet potato, jalapeno and avocado, which tasted like a limp mash. The main courses weren't terrible, but they surely weren't amazing.  I was most excited about ordering dessert. I ordered the nut and maple tart, and my friend chose the vegan chocolate cake. When I received my dessert, it was a bit awkward at first. There wasn't any tart component to it. A scoop of vanilla ice cream sat on top of sugar coated roasted pecans. I had to savour each little spoon of dessert, but in reality, I could've finished it off in one bite. It was delicious, but I did find the portion disappointing. My friend's vegan chocolate cake was warm, and drizzled with raspberry sauce. I am not one for mixing chocolaty desserts with fruit. However, I did try a bite, and the cake was moist. I probably couldn't have guessed it was vegan.  I was  still eyeing the other diner's meals; namely the nachos, which weren't part of the Taste MTL menu. I did leave the restaurant feeling bloated, and somewhat satisfied with my experience. The waiter was lovely (my friend broke a glass) and the service was pretty good. I would consider going again, and ordering those nachos. I felt it was a three-and-a-half star experience. For a university student though, I expected a bit more for the $19 I spent."}
{"text":"First thing I would like to mention is? Service was absolutely fantastic. They were really busy but when they served us, they were very friendly and very warm. We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here and they did extra service for his birthday that I didn't ask for which was turn off the lights when the cake came, not charging a cake cutting fee etc. Their food was not bad either. i didn't enjoy my polenta so much but all my other friends enjoyed their meal. The hemp burger was apparently delicious and I tried my boyfriends three cheese lasagna which was VERY good. I really liked the fact that you could opt to make your dishes vegan on demand/request. It caters to vegans out there for sure. I would definitely come back again if I'm in the neighborhood and try the quesadilla and nachos."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was fast. Make sure to reserve in advance. The restaurant is tiny !"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Montreal for 2 nights. The host of our Air BNB had this restaurant in her list of recommendations. After a little break from our drive we set out for a short walk to the restaurant. We were shocked to see how full the restaurant was and were told there was a 30 minute wait. This was pretty rough given there is hardly a wait area and it was 15 degrees outside. Within 15 excruciating minutes we were about ready to call it quits but then in walked a patron with a reservation and encouraged us to wait as it would be well worth it. We stayed and boy am I glad we did. My 4 kids can be about the finickiest bunch as they come. They all enjoyed their food. I had the yellow curry dish which was outstanding and my husband ate (and loved) the chili. I ended my meal with a delicious ginger basil creme brûlée. The two girls working the floor were swift and service was impecable given the mad rush they were experiencing. Overall we had a phenomenal experience here and would definitely visit again when in town. Highly recommended but if it's a Friday or Saturday make a reservation for sure!"}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is one of those restaurants everyone already knows about, but though you came late to the game, suit up and go out to the pitch anyhow. A vegetarian restaurant sensitive to all needs, this restaurant's menu is bursting with flavor waiting for you to discover. I eat vegan most of the time, and find many restaurants really lose heart when it comes to bold spice in vegan food. This place has no such reservations! Gluten free? Zero worries, my friend. You are welcome here. In spite of the warm weather, I had a Tunisian Tagine that pretty much blew my mind. With it I had a Glutenberg beer (of course). What will I have next? I'm thinking those nachos I saw looked pretty awesome. Lola Rosa one of those restaurants I will visit month after month, all through the year. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Would definitely go back. I had the quesadilla and my husband had the hemp burger. We also shared a kale salad and poutine, along with a pitcher of Boreal. Everything was so delicious and perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very good choice for vegetarians. Everything that came to the table was good. Not too expensive. Anyway, there aren't many other spots in the McGill Ghetto. Could get quite busy at times, so expect to wait in line if you don't have a reservation. Not too loud, considering... so an OK place for table conversation."}
{"text":"Great for lunch and caters well to vegans! We tried the vegan burrito and vegan burger with chickpea fries and both were amazing. Burger was slightly better. Definitely try the homemade BBQ sauce. A must for anyone vegan visiting or living in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was a cute place near McGill. We wanted a healthy option and came here after a yelp search. It did not disappoint. My bf got a salad and I got the curry which was delicious. Both were generous portions. The server was very nice as well!"}
{"text":"PROS: 1. I often find with vegetarian options at restaurants they tend to be bland and boring. However, at Lola Rosa you seriously can't see the difference! Their food is flavorful, interesting, and healthy! Loves!   2. The atmosphere is warm, relaxed, and super cute. I love the drawers with little memos people write.   3. Service is fast, friendly, and inviting.  OVERALL:  -I'd recommend the quesadilla and the chocolate-banana pie for dessert (sooo goooooood).  -Modestly priced and the food is worth the cost. -To this day, I still go back! :D"}
{"text":"Funky restaurant but average tasting food. We had the curry and the burrito. The curry was bland while the burrito had too much black beans compare to other ingredients. Overall, it wasn't a satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"While the food was very good, our service was awful. Our food took 45 minutes. Luckily I was in good company but that would have been a painful wait otherwise. We had to have asked for water a handful of times.  The waiter was condescending and inattentive. Will definitely not come back here, which is a shame since the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Excellents petits-dejeuners, sains et savoureux. Service aimable et courtois. Bon rapport qualité-prix."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and nice seating arrangements. Only thing is the food can be a bit greasy - but I guess that's a given with nachos/ burgers/fries/etc."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food - with the option to remove the cheese and make it vegan. The nachos and the burger is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place isn't very big and from my understanding is always busy...close to McGill campus, it draws a big crowd. The menu is vegetarian with several vegan options. The service was fast; check was brought out promptly most likely to accommodate the line waiting outside. They do take reservations so I would recommend that. I hade the chili and it was delicious and the portion size was perfect."}
{"text":"I had the quiche because it was highly recommended but it was lacking in flavour. It was a corn quiche, with chickpea salad and house salad. Needed so much salt and pepper. The texture throughout the plate was too similar so it was not enjoyable. My friend enjoyed his quesadilla and he said it was good. I do appreciate the variety for vegan and vegetarian and gluten free."}
{"text":"I'm always confused when my experience at a restaurant seems to contradict most of the other users on Yelp, so maybe the one time I ordered from Lola Rosa was a fluke, but it was honestly so bad that I feel I have to leave a review. I ordered (for delivery) the fries ($4.25) and the Black Bean Burrito ($13). When you add up the tax, delivery charge, and delivery tip, it came out to nearly $30 for one person. For that price, I expected good food. First of all, everything arrived cold. The fries were rubbery. The burrito was mushy, the rice on the side was dry, as if it had been cooked days earlier and refrigerated, and the \"green salad\" it came with was literally just lettuce with a side dressing. Even the salsa was terribly bland. I don't know, it's as if they don't even like food..."}
{"text":"My partner is vegetarian, and I was determined to find us some vegetarian poutine during our stay in Montreal. I searched high and low, but really struggled to find a place. There are a lot of restaurants that serve poutine with vegetables, but not many that make poutine without a meat-based gravy.  Eventually we stumbled upon Lola Rosa. Not only was the poutine delicious, but the rest of the meal was tasty and very well presented. There was some kind of flavor I didn't really care for in the dip that came with my bean-based fries (which were surprisingly good), but the service and the overall ambiance were pleasant. I would come here again if I ever find myself back in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I only came because it was my friend's birthday and she really wanted to try this place. Thinking back in it, I don't think I fully enjoyed it because I found the menu limiting. When your allergic to seeds (of any sort) and tofu it takes away some options. I ended up getting the mac and cheese with jalapenos. It was good but SO SPICY! My mouth was on fire! Dessert was a pleasant surprise. I got some sort of deconstructed cheese cake and it was pretty amazing. Although the food wasn't to my taste, the service was great. We had a great waitress who answered our many, many questions."}
{"text":"We had a delightful meal here! The atmosphere is chill and interesting. The menu is intriguing with a wide variety of flavor profiles. For an appetizer I got the poutine. I got the couscous tagine for my main dish. It was awesome - veggies, banzos and homemade seitan. It came with a special sauce that was refreshing and spicy at the same time. At the end of our evening we noticed the table we were sitting at had drawers. Inside were treasures! Former guests had written notes and left them behind, including words of wisdom, love stories, truths revealed, etc. Such a fun touch to end our evening at Lola Rosa!!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and it was excellent! Everything was beautifully plated, very nice portions, and delicious. It was a little loud with all the students, but a very nice and charming place to eat."}
{"text":"Très bon bistro végé, très bonne qualité et super service! Un peu trop bruyant à mon goût mais la qualité du menu nous fait oublier ça!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice place to stay around. The service was slow but good. There is good options which are not common. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! I am not a vegetarian but I love good vegetarian food and I found it at this super cute little restaurant. First of all I had the most amazing glass of Ipa beer and I asked for orange with it and the brought me a saucer of orange slices, how very nice! My husband had a sangria which he enjoyed it was garnished with a cinnamon stick, oranges and fresh cranberries. We both ordered the small nachos with avocado, one without sour cream and our orders came just as requested. While we were waiting we discovered small drawers in our table containing handwritten notes from past customers so we made sure to leave a note also. Our food was beyond delicious. We will have to return many times as we saw so many beautiful dishes leaving the kitchen, oh and heavenly desserts too! This is one of the places I will never forget such love and passion goes into the presentation of the food that you will actually taste it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and I'm usually a meat eater who needs meat with a meal for it to feel complete, so that says a lot.   I have been here twice now and both times I have LOVED the meals (spinach lasagna/burrito). The staff are warm and welcoming and the meals come quick.  I like to go on off hours, because it is a small venue there can sometimes be a lineup outside to get in."}
{"text":"Loveeeee Love Love this place!  I've ordered delivery from here before but this was my first time actually going to the place, and I loved it!  I always get the Nachos because they are so dreamy and amazing. You can get them just vegetarian, or you can get them vegan (with Daiya!).  What I love LOVEEEE about this place is when you sit at the tables, they have these little draws you can go through. People have added pieces of paper with things written on them. I love just sitting there waiting for my meal and reading all these papers. Also it feel awesome when you can contribute something!   The day I went they had a special vegan banana chocolate tart and omg, it was the best thing in the entire world!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Égal a mes attentes, je nsuis ni déçue ni emballé de ma première expérience dans ce resto. Peu adapté pour les bébés au niveau de l'espace, quoique chaleureux le petit endroit est limité. Je compte tout de même y retourné pour essayer autre chose dans le menu assez varié et espère y faire de super découvertes pour mes papilles. Je vous conseilles de réserver la fin dsemaine le resto était bondé et pour cette raison le temps d'attente pour nos plats un peu plus long."}
{"text":"After watching my travel companion gobble up Poutine all week, I finally got to have mine:  vegetarian or vegan, your choice and aMAZING!  Had the hemp burger too ... and washed it down with a fine organic red by Marie ... shoot!  Can't remember"}
{"text":"This is a good, cute little place near McGill campus...It's a great place to come to get some reasonably priced and healthy food near campus. The quesadillas are great and the food is definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Brunch Review:  Pros: Homemade Nutella, Bagel BLT  Cons: Potatoes could be better  Overview  We came here for brunch because my friend was vegan! Brunch is only on Saturdays and Sundays!   I've been to Lola Rosa 2 times before for dinner, but this was the first time for a brunch! They're rolling out a few more brunch menu items- specifically at the Milton location- throughout the summer. I hope to get a chance to try them out after this experience!   Each brunch item came with a side of potatoes and a small mason jar filled with fruit.  Mains:   Bagel BLT- this was a super light and satisfying menu item. I added avocado on mine! The lettuce was fresh and crisp, the tomato was nice and not too juicy. There was a crunch from that mock bacon which turned out to be a fried rice paper! It resembled the texture of crispy bacon quite well!   Pancakes- these pancakes were nice and moist but weren't really fluffy. I think they were made of banana- I didn't ask though! I will tell you though, these were served with an unbelievable delicious homemade Nutella (as well as a side of maple syrup). This Homemade Nutella spread was so good that we drove to the Williams Location to buy a jar of it right after.  Sides:  Fruit Jar- Damn! I hate melons...melons are nauseating to me! However, these were the best melons I ever had! They had mint and basil incorporated into it and they brought out a freshness I never knew possible. There were cantaloupe, honeydew and grape pieces in it.   Potatoes- these were lightly fried and sprinkled with a bit of paprika to add colour! They reminded me of ones you'd get frozen at the grocery store, then refry it at home! They were crisp but nothing special. I ate it all so I guess that says something ?  Drinks:  Mimosa- orange juice mixed with cider, how can you go wrong? It was refreshing! Neither sweet nor strong.  Service:  Our waitress was very friendly and allowed us to sit-down at 11:15am when the location opened at 11:30am. She was very honest with the menu and was knowledgeable on how everything was prepared! There was one other waiter, who we felt was pressuring us to leave quickly by asking us 3 times if we were done and if we were ready for the bill- as if people were waiting for our table. There weren't, and it wasn't busy. Maybe he was just pointing out to us that bills had to be printed and paid at the cash...could be a miscommunication so I won't hold that against him!   Overall I was very happy with my meal! I did not feel sleepy after brunch and felt relatively energized! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Montréal for a few days last week, and we visited Lola Rosa for a late lunch/early dinner.  We were staying at a hotel downtown on Sherbrooke, and wanted something close by.  We asked the hotel front desk for recommendations  on vegetarian spots, and they all voted for Lola Rosa.    We definitely went there with High expectations and we were not disappointed.  The atmosphere was very laid back. It was quiet in there with only a very few people eating there.  We got the back corner table, and it was perfect for our 1 year old since she likes to people watch.  And, this is the perfect place/location for that.  We ordered the Rosa salad for me, quesadilla for my husband and a side of rice, beans and avocado for our daughter.  My salad was really good, but the dressing was the best part! It was a house made maple vinaigrette and it really went well with the salad.  My husband loved his quesadilla too.  The service was also great!  I will definitely visit next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Many options on the menu. Big plates and absolutely worth it for lunch or brunch. Cozy place. We had curry, tacos, burrito and hemp burger. All turned out to be good picks."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great ambience, not that expensive. Would highly recommend this place And our waitress looked like Claire Underwood! Not kidding.. For those of you who have watched House of Cards"}
{"text":"What a gem! My sister had always wanted to try from Lola Rosa's selection of vegetarian food and while I was visiting town, we decided to give it a go one evening. With a pint of beer and a quesadilla before me in what seemed like no time, I quickly forgot about the bone-chilling cold wind outside. We shared a plate of the picante quesadilla, with spicy peppers and sweet potato (who woulda thought?!) and it tasted AMAZING! It wasn't too spicy, just perfect, and the dish also came with some tasty rice and a side of salad. The space is nice and small, very cozy, with comfy pillows to sit on at the tables near the window. Servers were friendly, and the selection of dishes provided a perfect variety of choices. I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and hearty vegetarian food for those who like to take a break from meat. Tried the half nachos, which were good but had way too many black beans versus all of the other toppings. The quiche was delicious but lacked a little kick - a little hot sauce goes a long way! The chickpeas were good and the salad dressing was tasty. For dessert, we tried key lime pie which was just ok. I would go again and try different menu options."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, quirky fun servers, fast service for a very busy little place, too! I'm a vegetarian and I love a place where I can literally order anything off the menu! The burrito is delicious! I jsut realized this place does delivery so I'm ordering it again tonight. The hemp burger not so great.....it was just sort of strange tasting...not much flavour and the BBQ sauce seemed completely out of place. Just sort of dry and bland. Anyways, I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good vegan restaurant right outside the hotel I stayed at recently! Seriously, it was across the street and the sign said 'vegetarien' so obviously it was a sign that it had to be my first stop before anything else.   I wish they had this in the greater toronto area. It's so cute, and definitely reminds me of something in kensington market (downtown toronto). Lola Rosa is huge and has the hipster-type of feel to it. Service was friendly and there were zero problems communicating. We ordered a sangria, which was HUGE and between 3 of us, we could barely finish. We all had a serious case of munchies (perhaps from something.. y'know..) and this was the perfect place to satisfy our hunger.   Everything here is vegetarian, and 80% of the menu you can change to make vegan (they have daiya cheese!!!) I had the quesadilla, which I found hard to finish because the portion was so big and it also came with rice and a side of salad. It was unbelievably good though.. I also ordered the chickpea/corn fries and they were soooo good. My friends said they tasted like cassava. I kept eating and eating until my stomach literally HURT and I still couldn't finish it.   Needless to say, my case of the munchies had turn into a case of itus until the AM.   I definitely would not hesitate to return to lola rosa next time in montreal."}
{"text":"Superbe expérience au Lola Rosa Milton. Les plats sont originaux et généreux, les produits frais et l'ambiance géniale! Et les prix restent raisonnables.  Nous y retournerons sans hésiter :)"}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  Had their vegan purine...I want to learnhow to do it at home!   I knew the one on Milton, but love the space and decoration on Ave du Parc.  To be discovered!"}
{"text":"Le soleil était éblouissant, et j'avais envie de tout sauf rentrer faire mes devoirs. J'ai donc décidé de me gâter en allant souper en solo au Lola Rosa. J'avais entendu plusieurs bons commentaires sur cette nouvelle succursale alors pourquoi pas?  Je suis arrivée vers 18:30, la place était presque vide. Parfait pour moi qui voulait une table sur la terrasse! Le serveur avait un charmant accent anglais et a pris soin de m'expliquer les plats du jour. J'ai ensuite commencé par commander une Bierbrier (blonde fumée qui m'a un peu déçu je dois l'avouer), et la salade du jour en entrée: Melon d'eau, concombre et tofu grillé sur salade mesclun et vinaigrette aux piments forts et à la lime. Goût surprenant et très rafraîchissant! Le tout est arrivé très rapidement aussi. Dès que j'eu finis mon assiette, on m'a apporté le fameux Hempburger et ses frites de pois chiches. Je n'avais pas nécessairement envie d'un burger vu la chaleur, les quesadillas piquants à la patate douce me faisaient plus de l'il, mais on m'a assuré que c'était la spécialité de la maison. Alors j'ai osé, et je n'ai pas été déçue! Le burger était extrêmement goûteux et savoureux; un goût unique comme aucun autre végé burger de Montréal! Les condiments et la sauce BBQ maison accompagnaient parfaitement la boulette de chanvre, tofu et lentille et les frites étaient délicatement croquantes et un tantinet sucrée juste comme il le faut. Trempé dans la mayo maison, c'était un vrai régal. J'ai entre temps commandé une deuxième bière, la Chi Orientale, une blanche au goût prononcé d'agrumes, qui a bien fait du bien avec la chaleur. J'aurai pu arrêter le repas après ça car j'étais bien remplie, mais après avoir lu tant de recommandation sur le brownie, il fallait absolument que j'y goûte. J'ai donc passé une bonne demi-heure à siroter ma bière et naviguer sur ma tablette en attendant qu'il y ait à nouveau de la place dans mon estomac! Il était 19:30 à ce moment, et le restaurant s'étaient finalement bien rempli. Le serveur fut bien agréable et n'a pas chigné lorsque je lui ai dit que je voulais attendre un peu pour le dessert, un point de plus pour le bon service! J'ai finalement commandé le fameux brownie et wow, je me suis félicité d'avoir attendu, ça en valait la peine! Un bon gros brownie fondant, chocolaté à souhait, baignant dans le sirop de chocolat qui recouvrait également une énorme boule de crème glacée vanille qui était déposée sur le brownie. Allez voir la photo, vous allez comprendre.  J'ai du partir très peu de temps après le dessert car mon autobus allait passer, mais j'ai pu payer en moins de 1 minute, excellent service encore une fois.  En gros, merveilleux service, staff souriant et compréhensif, nourriture fraîche, saveurs nouvelles et délicieuses, prix très raisonnable, emplacement agréable, je n'ai aucun mauvais commentaire! Je serai certainement de retour à 100%!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant and it makes me wish I lived in this city.  The nachos are fabulous, in fact next time I would order them without any cheese (real or vegan) at all because all the other toppings on it are so fantastic. I also had the Kale Quinoa salad which had the most fantastic dressing. The atmosphere is nice, the wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Menus are well-labelled with items that are GF/vegan friendly and priced surprisingly low. They also have vegan chocolate coconut graham pops for dessert on the go (looks a bit like a wagonwheel cookie on a stick), and you can bring home a few of their sauces/soups as well."}
{"text":"Was on a trip to Montreal and this place was recommended by my lonely planet guide.  Did not find it pricey as others mentioned, but then again I am not on a student budget and was looking for a good dinner while on vacation. Service was very good and wine was priced reasonably. I had the lasagna which was very filling and very good. Liked the specials written on a chalkboard when you walked in. Great atmosphere nice cafe feel."}
{"text":"Good food but it took over an hour for our orders to arrive. Our server overheard us griping and gave us free chips, guacamole & drinks"}
{"text":"I used to come to Lola Rosa at least once a week when I lived around the corner, I loved everything on the menu. After being away for several years I went back this weekend and ordered the nachos and hemp burger. The hemp burger was very different from what I had remembered - no longer on a bagel but served on two very thin slices of white toast. Needless to say I wasn't impressed, but the person I was with really liked it so I'm torn on this! The nachos were exactly the same, piled high with beans and veggies (maybe not as much avocado as before) and still very tasty. The server told us that the chef had changed 6 months ago and kept the nachos the same but changed some other items! So that makes sense for the hemp burger. Ohh just wish they had kept it the same. Still amazing though, just not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa used to be one of my go to restaurants but I've noticed that their quality and flavour has gone downhill this year. I'm still a huge sucker for their intimate decor and student friendly prices, definitely a very cute date place for students!  I used to always get their curry (tofu, chickpeas, vegetables served with rice and yogurt and naan bread) and it used to be super rich and flavourful but during my last visit, it just tasted bland and almost watery. Lola rosa used to also have killer nachos but the ones I got during y last visit lacked toppings and the bottom ones were soggy.   Overall, for the price you pay, its a good deal."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating in a vegetarian restaurant. I didn't really know what to expect because I love meat, chicken, pork and fish and I would never ever consider becoming vegetarian.   This place is in the heart of the McGill ghetto. So, you must expect to have a lot of students around. The restaurant itself is very small and it can get very loud. Thus I would not recommend this restaurant for a first/second/third date, because you pretty much have to yell at each other to have a conversation.   From the lunch menu, I ordered the burrito and my friend chose the half plate of nachos. I'll admit it: I expected vegetarian food to be dry. Yet, the burrito (filled with black beans) was surprisingly juicy and full of flavours. There also was a side of rice and a small salad, but I barely touched both because I just loved the burrito and it was quite big.   My friend's half plate of nachos was HUGE. She's a varsity athlete and she didn't even finish it. She said she and her mother once ordered the full plate of nachos and there were leftovers.    I heard their desserts are very good (I saw someone eating their brownie and it looked delicious). However, I was too full after my meal to try it.   Price: $12.50 before taxes, which is very reasonable.    One last comment, the service was a little slow. However, the place was full and there was a birthday lunch at the same time.   Conclusion: I will probably go back to try the plate of nachos and their brownie."}
{"text":"So good!! Everything that was carried by my table made me want to change my order but when my hemp burger arrived (recommended by the chef) I was beyond pleased. From the presentation to the taste it was amazing! My friend had the nachos and loved them. the curry plate my other friend had was delish. The brownie is also terrific. Only thing I didn't like was how cold it was inside the restaurant. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very affordable, cute vibe, super friendly service. We were so glad to have discovered this spot on our trip and would have come back a second time if we were staying longer!"}
{"text":"3 et demi  Couscous végé: grains de couscous parfaite et fondante. Sauce épicé parfaite pour rehausser le plat. Boulette avec une bonne texture et goûteuse. En somme, c'est une très bon plat...si vous chercher un plat avec des mélanges de saveurs maghrébines...peut-être pas, autrement très bien.   Burger oignons caramélisés: santé et goûteux. Avec frites et mayo maison. Boulette un peu molle...Overall: ok  Poutine: miam! Est-ce aussi rassasiant qu'une poutine avec une sauce à base de bouillon de boeuf...je pense que oui. Est-ce aussi réconfortant...non.   Trio de dessert: mousse de choco: ordinaire Crème brûlée gingembre et basilic: spéciale. Rend la texture moins lisse, malheureusement...mais très bon. Cheesecake: un peu liquide mais bon Belle présentation. Rien à se rouler par terre, mais efficace."}
{"text":"Had a breezy lunch date here. I had the Rosa salad. Husband had the hemp burger with fries and salad. Had the vegan chocolate cake for dessert and he had the berry cheesecake.  The salad was a definitely get again. They easily made it vegan by taking off the feta. Good salad with delicious maple dressing. Loved the combo of banana peppers, kalamata olives, chickpeas - will be duplicating it at home.  The chocolate cake was a disappointment. LOTS of raspberry sauce covered up the basic chocolate cake with a single walnut on top. Wish the cake had been something a little more than what was essentially a sheet cake piece with too much sauce. Wish I had tried the chocolate tart."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cute and cozy with delicious vegetarian food.   The menu has some soups and salads, veggie burgers and some other items. Most of the food here seems to be served with rice and a salad of some kind. I ordered some nachos and I felt like I was eating a much healthier version of them. I ordered a 1/2 portion, which was served on a pizza cutting board. The nachos were topped with cheese, avocado, black beans, tomatoes, green peppers,  green beans, and sour cream. Messy to eat, but so yummy. The nachos didn't come with the side orders I mentioned before, but the meal was quite filling.  This place is around McGill University and seems to be really popular with the students.  It was very busy when I arrived with my date and we had to wait around a 1/2 hour for a table. The place is small, so reservations might be a good idea!  Also, check what's inside the drawers on the tables, you'll be amused.   I'd definitely go here more often if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian and a lazy cook, i really want to like Lola Rosa , which is just around the corner from my house...but every time I've been there ive found the food disappointing.  The restaurant is super cute inside and the service is friendly. The menu is extensive and very reasonably priced...everything in the menu SOUNDS really good...  I've given this place a few tries! The hemp burger was recommended to me, but i found it rather stodgy and dry, although it came with a nice side-salad. The black bean sauce on the Poutine made an already heavy dish (!) extra heavy, although it had sweet potato fries which was nice. I got the nachos to take away, and there was hardly any toppings/cheese on them, it was almost just a plate of dry tortilla chips!!  The best thing I've had there is the curry which is nice and chunky but still lacked flavour.  Good portion sizes for the price and its always busy so they must be doing something right, but there is definitely better veg/vegan food to be had in this city!"}
{"text":"Oh man, super huge fan! In Montreal for work and needed to grab a bite to eat, so I slap \"vegan\" into the ol' Yelp search and just picked the closest place. When they asked me if I was ready to order I just gave two easy instructions. Bring me the darkest beer you have on tap and your favorite dish on the menu. I wound up with an amber-ish Christmas beer and the tunisian stew. First I was super surprised that both hit the table within like 5 minutes. The stew was amazing, great sweet savory pairing brought home by raisins and cinnamon balanced out with feta and tumeric. It was home-y it was warming, the perfect dish for a chilly night with a dusting of snow. The beer really went nicely with the dish with a little bit of spice of it's own.   A great dish like that gave me enough confidence to try their dessert and I went with the Twix Tarte. It was awesome, rich and fudge-y filling with an awesome chocolate sauce. It definitely was reminiscent of Twix but in a much more grown up, much more indulgent sort of way. The service was fast and friendly. I really lucked out stumbling into a gem here. Check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and really enjoyed it. I love meat, but I'm open to the occasional vegetarian meal if the flavour is good.  Started with the half nachos and small poutine. The nachose were excellent! The salsa, guacamole and sour cream were fresh and tasty, the chips had a good crunch, and the cheese helped keep it all together. The poutine tasted like a poutine. The fries were fresh and had that rustic feel to them, the cheese had squeaky goodness, and the gravy was thick and rich.  I had the hempburger for my main and the burger itself was delicious. I love a good burger, so I was surprised by the very familiar flavour. The texture of the patty is off, but that's to be expected. The flavours were spot on, though, with a good BBQ feel to it. The salad that comes with it was nice, but I really wasn't a fan of the fries. They must be different than the ones in the poutine, because these started out okay on first bite but the more you chewed, it started to get a grainy texture to it. I was so full by then that I didn't finish the fries and was so satisfied by the meal that I didn't care.  I really wanted to try dessert - the brownie with ice cream looked amazing - but I was too full. Maybe next time.  I had a cocktail with two kinds of rum and mango juice. It was a bit small, but delicious.  Overall, I was really happy about the meal. The environment and service was also great. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, and not just vegetarians. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a gem in the McGill ghetto. I'm a meat lover, but everytime i come here, I really don't mind not having any meat in my dish. Everything here is very tasty. I tried almost everything on the menu and i enjoyed them all.   However, the place is always full, so if you're planning to go during the weekend, it's safer to call and make reservation. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"If the mark of a good restaurant is how full you feel when you leave then this place is 5  stars! We all know though that quality weighs more heavily in the ranking. Luckily for me that wasn't a concern here either. I was excited to try out this popular establishment when I read about it recently on a \"places to eat in Montreal\" blog. I love vegetarian food; I love Mexican and I love good value for my money. This place hit on all fronts. I arrived at 7 and had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was jam packed with what appeared to be all university students. When I was finally seated I received prompt friendly service. I ordered a glass of red wine ($6 per glass! Bonus!), chips and salsa to start and the quesadilla with sweet potato. The chips were warm and substantially thick and served with hot (as in steam rising from the bowl) salsa. That was kind of odd and it reminded me of chili without beans but after a few tries they grew on me. I really liked my quesadilla and nice little salad on the side. I didn't bother eating the accompanying rice as the carb heavy main course was already very filling. Overall I thought it was great value for the money and I would recommend it as a place to go if you are in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good vegetarian food. I had an excellent curry and my wife had an excellent ragout. Flawless service. Great desserts too. Nice but slightly cramped, though easily offset by the food. We made a reservation, gather that's generally wise as this is a very popular spot."}
{"text":"Officially one of my favorite restaurants! The food was great, ambiance was fantastic, and the staff was very friendly. I ordered the burrito, and my sister ordered the quesadillas. It looks ten times better than any Texas Mexican food! We also started off with the mac n cheese, which was amazing. And ended the meal with a rich, creamy, Twix pie. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Very small and cozy cafe with plenty of healthy, vegetarian options. I loved the place and I would go back, if I ever visit Montreal. I like the decor and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is one of those restaurants that every McGill student knows about for better or for worse. On one hand, it serves up high-quality vegetarian eats at reasonable prices; however, it's also quite possibly the only good restaurant in the Ghetto (hence one of the reasons why I chose to live deeper in the Plateau). Therefore, long wait times and crowded, loud conversation-making are bound to happen, unless you make a reservation like I did (life hacks everyone).  I came here with a friend for a food date and we were promptly seated and utterly famished since we hadn't eaten at all that day. We ordered two chai lattes (an épicé for me and a regular one for her), a half order of nachos to share, and a mac and cheese for her and a lasagna for me. The chai was perfectly gingery for my taste (although my friend thought it was way too much), and I must have forgotten about how big even the half portion of nachos is but we attacked it anyway. The textures of the salsa, beans, avocado, tomato, and cheese melded together in a colorful flavor explosion, although the soggy chips at the bottom weren't exactly a plus. Afterwards, we received our main dishes. I thought the lasagna was divine and thought that the spinach pasta made an ordinary dish more unique, and the fact that they included mushrooms in the cheese and tomato sauce filling made it even better. Basically, it contained almost all of my favorites in one dish, something that I loved. The side salad was also surprisingly really good even with the dressing and croutons, and normally I hate salad dressing and think croutons are unnecessary. I tried my friend's mac and cheese, and to be honest, I thought it could have been creamier, although it was still satisfying.  Afterwards, even though we were completely stuffed, we decided to say f*ck it and order dessert anyway. I got the matcha cake with a chia whipped topping and raspberry coulis, and my friend got the pineapple and raspberry cheesecake. The matcha cake actually had the green tea flavor coming through, and I thought the chia topping and raspberry coulis were amazing (you could definitely tell they used real raspberries). I wish that the cake itself was more moist and spongy, however, since it came off as a bit dry to me. I tried the cheesecake as well; in my opinion, they used way too much cream cheese and didn't use enough pineapple flavoring as I could barely taste it. It had a very cute and neat presentation in a little jar, but for $6.50 I still thought that it was kind of expensive.  I will definitely come back to Lola Rosa for their main dishes and perhaps sample some more of their desserts, as their food is very satisfying and will leave you stuffed to the brim. What I've found is that even those with carnivorous tendencies give it their seal of approval, so it's sure to be a crowd-pleaser no matter who you're catering to."}
{"text":"I am *not* a vegetarian nor do I speak French but I had a great meal and experience here nonetheless.  I had the Tomato Pie, a glass of Pinot Noir, Ice Cream, and Coffee: total 36.27 CAD.  The place was packed when I walked in with all but 2 tables filled.  Despite this I was greeted and seated immediately.  Nice.  The ambiance is informal, relaxed, but energetic with a little whimsy on the side.  Individual tables for two get pulled together for larger groups.  The menu is short but I found several attractive options.  If I had stayed in the area I would have gone back to sample other options.  The ice cream with almonds was outstanding and brilliant in its simplicity.  When I left I felt well fed and well cared for."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at Lola Rosa! I am not exactly a go forward for vegetarian food, but hands down for this place. Very tasty and hearty food. We started with the soup of the day which was a blend of cauliflower, carrots and some extra veggies, all blended together with the right amount of heat. Following that, my wife had the Chilli and I had the three cheese lasagna (not considered vegetarian for some due to the cheese) and both were exceptional. Service was very good, staff was friendly and prompt. All in all, it definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite vegan restaurant! Which is a shame considering I live all the way in California. This place is always packed and for good reason. Despite their constant full house, their service is quick and the food comes out pretty fast. I got the vegan quesadillas with avocado and my platter was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Also got rum and coke and their Twix pie for dessert, which is also vegan! Phenomenal food, great staff, and good atmosphere. I will say though, that this is a smaller restaurant and my friend, who is heavier set, sat a bit uncomfortably for a while due to close quarters with other tables!"}
{"text":"Great Vegan place! I tried the poutine, quinoa salad and quesadilla! All great!  I wouldn't recommend the brownie dessert. It's too much dark chocolate and thick."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We were visiting from Toronto and with a vegan in tow we needed a place where both of us could have a delicious meal. The food was delicious and there were lots of options for vegetarians and vegans alike. I highly recommend!  Piece of advice though....make a reso if you're going on a busier night. However, even if you don't, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is delicious- even for non vegetarians!  Hi there, I recently visited this place with a group of vegeterian / vegan friends. My fiancé and I are not vegeterians , I am a GLuten Intolerant tho.   We were very positively surprised with the quality and taste of the food, also of the gluten free options.  I have gone to quite many vege places but this one seems to get the flavors quite well.   My fiancè had  -burrito, he quite liked it even tho it did not have any meat as his usual burritos,  and I had  -the curry -which we both loved. We also tasted :  -Nachos -great- but could come with the option of non vegan cheese tho. -Chick pea fries- interesting - underspiced- they would taste so much better with garlic & salt n pepper.  -deserts all utterly delicious, especially the gluten free ones I had- coconut chocolate brownie- so good - for the raw kind-  We were really impressed. My friends tried all the other deserts and they loved it all.   I recommend this place for a family and friend gatherings- the service was superb!!!  Food great. Drinks great.  The only thing that was not satisfying was the fact that some things were under and some over spiced- for example- one day curry was medium the other super salty- and shirley temple- tasted very artificial, and had way too much sugar, to the point you couldn't drink it unless you split it in to parts and mix with water in 3 other glasses. (4 full glasses all together and still too sweet).    Tip- try not to eat several hours before going there portions don't look big but all that fiber will fill you up so much , really to the limits! Eat slow, for real."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa est un excellent restaurant. Parfait pour une sortie simple, même avec des enfants, bien qu'il n'y ait pas de menu enfant... on arrive à trouver !  Le tempeh au curry vert était inoubliable... j'aurais du mal à commander autre chose lors de ma prochaine visite. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"I LOVE the ambiance here but the last time I was here they stopped the music which took away from the experience.  I was enjoying their gluten free poutine until I found out that they used the same oil for cooking other things so there could be cross contamination :(  Also.. I really wish there were more gluten free options. I wasn't a fan of the salads as the cold broccoli was weird to me. I want a lasagna or burger with a GF bun OR some really tasty fresh salads.   There were a tiny bit of egg shells in my hash omelette. Might be a 1 time fluke. Most people wouldn't notice it but I'm very sensitive to that.  Their gf nachos had way too much raw onion in it, my son didn't want anything to do with it. I don't know why it wasn't listed as being spicy on  the menu as it certainly is.  The coffee and lattes is just OK.   The dessert options that were GF and DF were also really limited.   This place is more for someone without food allergies or sensitivities."}
{"text":"Je suis sortie du Lola Rosa Park avec l'impression que j'étais pleine de santé. Mes nouveaux amis Couchsurfers indiens et moi (groupe de 5) avons choisi ce restaurant parce que l'un d'entre eux est végétarien. On s'adapte... et on adore!  Menu impressionnant. Tous les plats que j'ai goûtés (parce que tant qu'à y être, on a fait une petite rotation des assiettes) sont savoureux. Prix abordables. Certaines assiettes sont beaucoup plus fournies que d'autres, il vaut mieux s'informer au niveau des portions avant de commander, selon votre appétit.   Seul problème: le service. Nous avons attendu très longtemps avant de pouvoir s'asseoir malgré plusieurs tables libres et il semblait y avoir un malentendu entre les serveurs. Notre serveuse semblait peu irritée par mes amis qui ne connaissaient pas certains ingrédients présentés dans le menu (et qui n'étaient pas désagréables pour autant, ça leur prenait juste un peu plus de temps à commander). Je peux comprendre qu'en fin de journée, la fatigue nous rend plus sensible, mais quelques sourires n'auraient pas été de trop.   Cela dit, j'y retournerai sans les Couchsurfers à l'anglais légèrement déficient, pour la qualité des plats servis. C'était bon bon bon bon bon!"}
{"text":"This more of the typical hippy hangout that may vegetarian restaurants are, but the food is very good and it has been feeding people for a long time.  Many who live here find it their favorite and I have nothing to contradict that as a visitor.  Soup was spicy.  Vegeburger was home made and good.  Loud music and lots of students so not the place for a quiet romantic dinner.  But good food, quick service, and no dead animals involved."}
{"text":"The Lola Nachos are incredible, and HUGE! You must order CID, it's a delicious cider that's 10%! My fiance LOVED the cheesecake in a mason jar (amazing and creamy gf dessert) and I LOVED l'incroyable, you have to check out our post for photos :) Enjoy!! http://mrandmrsadventure.com/2015/06/30/the-best-montreal-bucket-list-youll-ever-find/"}
{"text":"Vegan nachos good. So was the curry.   Place is v cute. Lady who seemed to be owner or manager was v friendly."}
{"text":"Very McGill, dishes are big in size, very pretty ladies in service. :) It's a cozy place where you want to close your eyes and wait for stars to fall."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Great service as well. I hate to complain but our food compared to the rest we've eaten in Montreal is subpar. Perhaps we made the mistake of ordering the burrito and nachos. We are Texans and should know better than to buy Mexican food up north. I saw a review that said the burrito was great, so I wanted to try it. The food was definitely made the way that I would make it at home. That is not saying a lot. I applaud them for having a meatless restaurant. I support the cause."}
{"text":"Came around 12pm on a Saturday and got seated right away. Heard the nachos were amazing so we ordered a small and it was delicious! The small was definitely enough for 4 of us. Also ordered the Mac and cheese which was amazing, perfect amount of spice. The skillet and the hemp burger was okay.... had better brunch food before. All in all, was an alright spot."}
{"text":"Lieu agréable, personnel très accueillant, carte appétissante. Le burger au hemp est très bon manque peut être un peu de sel ou autre pour rechausser le goût mais sinon parfait. Je recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, lots of options, very cozy, and well-priced.  No matter when you are going, call ahead for a reservation!"}
{"text":"For a weekend trip in Montreal, we were trying to find a place to eat after a long day of travel. The restaurant closes at 10 pm and we entered at 9:56 pm. Instead of being turned away, our server was accommodating and very gracious.  The food was absolutely delicious. Sangria is great! Get a pitcher. You will regret it otherwise. Burrito, fantastic!The best thing on the menu, ginger creme brulee. YUM SO happy we found this tucked away gem of a place. Will definitely go back for the food, drinks and WONDERFUL SERVICE."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Wonderful, perfectly done chocolate brownie ala mode dessert.  Good draft beer.  I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing here, but I just don't get the hype. Got the kale salad--tofu was good, but there was maybe a tablespoon of quinoa, a TEASPOON of dressing, and that was about it. Not flavorful at all. It was so flat.  Ambiance is good. It's close to the park. Service is meh-they brought me my food, and I had to ask for silverware (what am I going to do, eat the salad with my face?).  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Honestly, some of the best vegetarian food I've ever had. We went with a rather large group (8 hungry guys between 21-25), and somehow managed to get a table without a reservation. In a city full of of smoked meat sandwiches and bbq pulled pork poutine, this is a haven for vegetarians, This restaurant fit the bill and left everyone happy, and most importantly, full on a quality vegetarian meal.   Food: impeccable. Most people ordered a burrito (debatable contest for best burrito they've ever had), quesadillas (which made a few appearances on Instagram), or the curry (I forgot it was spicy, but still just as delicious).  Desserts: what really put the meal over the top was the sangria. Rather inexpensive (I'm used to NYC prices) and delicious. We got a sangria made with cinnamon and whiskey, which I've never seen before but all I want to do is steal the recipe and make it at home.   Cons of the restaurant: the wait. Like I mentioned, we didn't have much of a wait, but I walked by the restaurant during peak hours and saw a line out the door more than once. But, you can make a reservation AND THEY DELIVER!!  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm definitely going back, and if the owner is reading this, please message me your whiskey and cinnamon sangria recipe so I can spread the goodness with some deprived and overcharged New Yorkers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while solo exploring Montreal. It's always awesome to find a restaurant that caters specifically to vegetarians. They had a wide variety of menu items, which were clearly marked if they were vegan, gluten free, or could be modified. The waitress was very nice and did not even appear judgmental when I ordered a tempranillo at 12:40 PM. I got the burrito, which was modified to be gluten free by removing the tortilla. The flavor was really on point and I especially liked the sweet potato puree.  The salad that came with it had some really tasty dressing. I enjoyed sitting in the cute little outdoor area and didn't feel pressured to leave while I read my book."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. We had the curry and the hempburger. For drinks we had the red wine (cabernet sauvignon) and the alchemiste post colonial ipa. Wine and beer were excellent. The curry and the burger were freshly made and tasted very good. For dessert we had the hot browney with vanilla ice: tasted heavenly! On a Thursday night the restaurant  filled up pretty quickly. We had a good time and will be back! Service was excellent! The staff was very quickly and they were very friendly!"}
{"text":"With a party of 5, everyone enjoy the food they ordered including the non vegetarians.   Everything on the menu is delicious including the Sangria. I ordered the Hemp burger with Chick Pea fries and it was one of the best burgers I have tasted. Also the Vegan Poutine is a must.   My recommendation is to call ahead and reserve a table as this place is always busy.   The ambiance is excellent and the staff are very friendly and the price of the food is of good value.   This is definitely a place for everyone and will be coming back to dine here when I am back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cute small vegetarian/vegan restaurant by McGill University. Wooden tables and comfortable seating. Atmosphere is nice, and they have a small bar.  For lunch, I got the soup, which was very good. Salad was OK, but not impressive. The salad portion was sizable, however.   The service is friendly for the most part, but was slow. A soup and salad should not really take 20 minutes or so. Much of this delay, I think, was because the person whom I placed the order with was eating his lunch and did not bother to move quickly to place or make the order.   Overall, my experience was really worth 3.5 stars, but I am bumping it up because I may have misinterpreted the slowness. I would go back and try something other than salad."}
{"text":"LOVED it. Friendly and attentive staff, nice place to come by on your own (which I did on a Sunday afternoon) and have a healthy meal under the sun. Quality of food was simple yet excellent, fresh and delicious just as you'd hope/expect from a place like this! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian by any means...but, as I enjoyed my Lasagna I totally forgot that I wasn't eating any type of meat in my dish.  Wow, it was delicious!!!  This place has become one of my favorites in Montreal for sure...I just wish I could take this place back home to Dallas, Texas.  :)  Awesome place to eat at...I most definetly recommend this place to any person that just loves to eat delicious food."}
{"text":"I went there as they opened for lunch on a week-day. It was filled with students, as McGill University is right by the corner.  The interior decor is hipster: wooden walls, with eclectic babioles hanging everywhere. It's a small restaurant, 20 tables at most, so it got filled up rather quickly and a line started to former ousting   Lola's Nachos Awesome! Best nachos I've had in a while  Three cheese & Spinach Lasagna Deliciously cheesy! Hearty portion, comes with a side salad"}
{"text":"Réservation par téléphone au préalable (il me semble que c'est fort fréquenté) et nous voilà installé sur la terrasse à 19h. Le menu propose pas mal d'options je trouve.  J'opte pour le burrito aux fèves noires, mozzarella et 5 légumes, et mon ami prend le chili aux 3 fèves, vin rouge et piments chipotle.  Je suis absolument conquise par mon burrito ! C'est un vrai délice ! L'assiette est parfaite, la quantité est top, et vraiment c'est trop bon ! Mon ami par contre a trouvé le chili très basique et pas tellement épicé par rapport à ce qui est annoncé. Pour lui c'est plutôt une déception.  Nous avons servi rapidement, et notre serveuse était très sympa. De mon point de vue, c'est un succès et j'y retournerai au moins pour le burrito !"}
{"text":"Tout ce que l'on a mangé était très bon. La salade au chèvre avec le muffin à la pistache était succulente. Pas une grosse part, cela va bien pour une entrée. Les quesadillas à la patate douce, avocat et cheddar étaient excellente. C'était assez bien garnis et l'Accompagnement de riz basmati et la petite salade avec allait à ravir. En dessert buche de noël (gâteau, pas buche glacé à vrai dire) ainsi que le gateau à base de noix de coco, chocolat et datte étaient à tomber. Vraiment l'ensemble était nickel. Au niveau du service c'était très sympathique. Le lieu est sympa, je n'ai pas trouvé cela bruyant et c'éest un espace agréable.  Il y a pleins d'autres choses qui ne donnent envie d'y retourner notamment le burrito ;) A bientôt !"}
{"text":"YUM.  This place is genuine.  Good.  Food.  Creative and healthy but not pretentious, and with plenty of treats.  The Lola salad was fresh and tasty.  The breakfast hash was fabulous.  Kombucha yum.  Decadent tasty dessert (jelly filled donuts with a side of chia coconut cream and fudge sauce.  There were 6 of us.  All of our plates were completely cleaned.  We left feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  The ambience is relaxed and friendly.  I tried to go back 2 days later, but they were closed for upkeep.  If I lived here, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, interior, and vibe. The food is only decent though, not horrible, not bad, just decent. I definitely did not leave feeling as though I got my money's worth. My Hemp burger was a lil burnt, the avacado instead of guac on the nachos was a lazy move, the spiced salsa tasted like it was better suited for Samosa dipping, and the almond cheese was nothing special."}
{"text":"c'est bon!!! c'est pas cher et j'amie la!!"}
{"text":"Believe me, you won't care for one second it's vegetarian.  The Lasagna and other oven plates are great. The Curry is also very good.  The ambient is cozy and it's very nicely located in the McGill ghetto, but it could be anywhere."}
{"text":"Peu importe la place Lola Rosa testé, ca reste l'un de mes lieux favoris pour manger des plats végétaliens délicieux. Les plats sont savoureux et consistants, aux prix abordables. Il y a de la variété sur le menu, pour tous les goûts. Tous les \"non végétariens\" que j'ai amené là bas ont été bluffés et convaincus! Ils ne sont certes pas devenus végétariens pour autant, mais cela a fortement éveillé leur curiosité et c'est le principal."}
{"text":"Une amie tout droit venue de France m'en a parlé, elle même en avait entendu parlé par des connaissances. Je me suis dit que si on en parlait en France, ca devait en valoir le coup.  Alors un soir, on a décidé d'aller essayer pour nous en faire une idée. L'endroit est très sympathique et agréable, bien situé. On a eu la chance de pouvoir avoir une table de suite mais ce n'était pas gagné.  Le choix n'est pas très vaste, mais il y a ce qu'il faut et c'est largement suffisant pour ne pas se perdre au milieu d'une multitude de plats.  Le servie est bon, rapide et efficace.  J'ai choisi le burger de chanvre, je crois qu'à ce jour il reste le meilleur burger végétarien que j'ai pu goûter, un vrai délice. Et que dire du dessert... Un cheesecake démentiel ! Une véritable merveille en bouche. Tout le monde (on était 4) a adoré son plat, même les non-végétarien qui ne sont pas habitués à manger ce genre de cuisine. Quoi qu'il en soit, Lola Rosa a fait l'unanimité ce soir là."}
{"text":"Love Lola Rosa, both locations.   The first time I went, my mother and I shared a file serving of Nachos. Woah, talk about amazing, and oh so filling.  Next we each had a Lola Rosa salad. Amazing a great variety of greens and veggies. The combinations of the both was definitely a lot of food and my mother and I had trouble finishing.   More recently I want back to try the coveted vegan poutine I have heard so much about.  It was delicious. I love the mix of gold Yukon and sweet potatoes. The gravy is a little different then traditional poutine, but I still loved it and definitely recommend.   Lola Rosa, we will meet again."}
{"text":"Healthy peaceful little place in the McGill ghetto which survives because it doesn't gouge students and it serves up tasty veggie Mexican with a smile. Seats about twenty, decor is eclectic, pretty in pink, casual. The burritos and quesadillas are tasty by Montreal latin standards, and everything is veggie but not in a granola flavourless way."}
{"text":"Les serveuses étaient tellement rude. Il neigeait cette journée là et elle a refusé de me laisser d'attendre à l'intérieur. Puis on attendait a l'extérieur pour 15 minutes et elles nous ont oublié! Apres que je l ai demande s'il y a tjrs pas de place, elle me regarde et répond  non et me dire: tu peux partir si tu veux pas attendre!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time going to this vegetarian eatery.  One word from us: YUMMY!  Everything we ordered was delicious, evident  by the empty plates for all.  Here's what we ordered:   Starters -hot potato soup - reminded me of a beef and barley type soup but without the animal -cold green soup - hints of Indian spice, mixed in with the coolness of sour cream -1/2 order of nachos (although this could easily pass for a full order) - mound of warmly baked nachos, guacamole, light sour cream, corn nibblets, red peppers, small black beans  Entrees -stuffed grilled portabello mushroom with small side salad.  The mushroom was topped with goat cheese, a crumble of bread crumbs and must be a legume of sorts, that gave it all texture - one of my faves from last night. -Hemp burger - served on a large bun, with cheese and tomato, one of the best and different veggie burgers in town! -Sweet & Yukon potato poutine - served with a fabulous Indian and cinnamon bean sauce -Large green salad - now you must wonder why we ordered the salad as a main: the description was so inviting and our little guy LOVES SALAD.  This did not disappoint: it was a simple mixed green salad with shallots, but the best part was the vinaigrette with crushed fresh raspberries in it.  This is the same vinaigrette used in the side for the portabello.  Dessert -homemade brownie topped with ice cream and a chocolate sauce drizzled on top -raspberry and pineapple cheesecake served in a mason jar was my piece de resistance.... we all fought over who could have the last spoonful!!  The raspberry puree was fresh, the texture and temperature of the cheesecake was delightful.  Service & Decor The service was excellent: it was our first time going here, and the waiter was extremely helpful and attentive, the staff continuously bringing us water.  Par none service! The decor is mix between contemporary (as another poster commented) with 'new' antiques.  In the drawers of the tables are notes from previous patrons, ours included a note \"Thank you for not eating me\" and the person drew a pig.  Really cute.  Bathrooms I have always believed that you can tell alot about a restaurant by how clean their bathrooms are; these are very clean, the stalls are generous.  That's it for today but we will surely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"As a carnivore, the idea of a Vegetarian restaurant is head-scratching... I went there backward... But the dishes were so great, tasty, fulfilling, with delicious margaritas, I am so looking forward to go back! I heard from the owner they would open in LA soon: I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Average vegetarian food, four star was given for its exceptional tasty chocolate brownie! Must try!"}
{"text":"By far the best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal. I've been trying out Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants lately, and Lola Rosa is at the top of my list. The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're in the Milton-Parc area, and a staple McGill tradition!  Whether you're a religious meat eater or just want to try vegan food, you're going to love this place. Its vibe is so cute and the food is wonderful, definitely go for the mac and cheese, the nachos, quesadillas, the curry... its all great.  Only reason I gave it a 4 is because the place is really tight, if you want to guarantee a spot you're better off reserving than waiting in line because its always crowded."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I lived in Montreal. It's a favourite of university students as the price is right and the food is divine! It looks pretty hippy inside but it has a lot of character. It is a unique type of place! It used to be run by two French guys, who knows now."}
{"text":"I loved the food I got here. I got a soup and salad and both were great! Not many vegan options on the menu, as it was vegetarian, which was disappointing but the staff were friendly and the atmosphere was great! Definitely recommend you stop in at this location."}
{"text":"great date spot. gf and i always share the vegan nachos which are so good, but wish they served the half-portion on a cutting board. very cosy but still intimate. love this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegetarian food with vegan options. The nachos are a great choice; the full size nachos are really big, and way enough to share between two people. Last time I came here, I order the salad and asked for a vegan version, which meant removing the cheese. However, when the salad came there very visible pieces of cheese on my salad. I asked and they took it back and removed the cheese. In my friend's order, they forgot the avocados. Overall, this is a convenient place with nice atmosphere to eat right next to McGill."}
{"text":"Food here, while vegetarian, will leave most omnivores or carnivores satisfied.  The vegetarian burger is very flavorful and the accompanying chickpea flour fries are definitely interesting and delicious!  Their poutine is also good and you have the choice between cheese or a vegan alternative.   Finally, the ambience is really nice and I suggest you try their showcase beer! It changes (each few weeks or each month?)!"}
{"text":"while eating here, I totally forgot I was at a vegetarian restaurant!  The nachos are pretty popular. I might hazard a guess that around 80% of the tables at the nachos--either full portion (MOUNTAIN STATUS) or the half portion: manageable. My friend and I shared the half portion nachos (which come with bell peppers, cheese, black beans, avocado, sour cream, tomatos, ...!) and then I had the half rosa salad and she had the lasagna. (as with all nachos: eat quickly or else they get soggy.) A DEFINITE RECOMMEND.  The salad was delightful: it's got chickpeas which automatically mean pluses in my book. the lasagna had spinach and looked gloriously cheesy. It comes with a side caesar salad as well. from what I've heard, the desserts are worth a try too...but after all that food, we were right stuffed! maybe next time...we'll be back. watch out!  verdict: yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! (do I sound like a porn star yet? that wasn't my intention. I sincerely apologise.)"}
{"text":"Great vegan spot in Montreal - possibly my favourite in Montreal. They have great brunch options and their chocolate caramel tarte is to die for"}
{"text":"We were looking for an interesting meal after walking around Montreal all day. My partner being vegetarian, we thought we'd check out Lola Rosa which seemed to offer a non run of the mill menu.   Food: we ordered a tomato tart and a lasagna. The lasagna was as good as a vegetarian lasagna can get. The tomato tart was in a well made pastry, but the filling could have been made slightly more interesting. It had finely chopped tomato and onions, so gave one the feeling of the main ingredient missing. Both dishes came with a lettuce salad with some shredded beet and carrot.  Filling and tasty enough. The most unique of the order and the star was the soup du jour - kale, white wine and coconut milk. Small portion but very tasty. Food gets 3.5 (4 for the soup though!)  Ambience: the place is small, and feels warm and cozy, filling the room with a warm yellow light. There's a big window that opens out to the road and is kept open in the summer time - brings in light and adds character. Ambience gets a 3.5.  Service: There were 2 women serving that evening. Ours was a very efficient, friendly and pleasant lady (we asked when we got seated if we could have another table instead, she was very nice about it) service gets a 4.  Overall: I definitely recommended this restaurant - good food, warm ambience, great service. Note: we came here on a Saturday evening and we waited about 20 minutes for a table of 2 - there was a decent sized line the whole time we were there, testament to a deserved popularity."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch to meet a friend who works at nearby McGill University. Had the Hemp Burger, which came with a pickle spear and BBQ sauce on a grilled bun, and a small side of salad and chick pea salad. I ordered a local raspberry wheat beer and enjoyed it all. The place has a modern rustic decor and is small, with tables tightly packed and is very popular. I wouldn't walk in with a huge oversized bag. On this fine day, the front windows were all open and there was a lovely breeze. Staff is bilingual."}
{"text":"The meal I ordered had 2 spicy peppers next to it on the menu, so I assumed it would be spicy. The meal wasn't spicy so I asked for more hot sauce. The hot sauce wasn't hot, so I asked for some peppers. The waiters were kind and brought everything I asked for, however they failed to mention that they would charge me for each of these things!! Who charges for hot sauce?? I wouldn't have asked for it if I knew I would be charged, I was just trying to enjoy my meal. This plus the 30 minute wait for food really made for a mediocre experience. Food wasn't good enough to make up for it (all the added salt is what makes it somewhat flavourful)."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and tasty veggie eats- seems like a real locals joint. Took a while for us to be seated in a seat that had seemed to be there the whole time. Definitely coming back here next time!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon, I was in Montreal with a large group of people and I suggested we check out Lola Rosa for dinner. From that point on, it was up to me to get a last minute reservation for a large party, guide nine people to the restaurant, and hope that everyone liked it.  Happily, everyone loved the delicious comfort food. Lola Rosa is quite a cozy restaurant, so we were a bit squeezed into our table, but once the food came out, everyone was happy. The Tunisian Ragout I ordered was out of sight delicious: chickpeas, cabbage and raisins on a bed of bulgur wheat, veganized without feta for me. Everything is vegetarian but the items that can be made vegan are noted with triangles on the menu. Quite a few others had the lasagna and ordered beer. The prices were reasonable and the meal came out fairly quickly, although we were never rushed to finish."}
{"text":"Nice homemade quality vegetarian that is great tasting. The portions are big and the meals can be very yummy, but heavy (Mexican style). I would recommend for a chill / relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here with my husband and our 2 vegan friends. We aren't from Montreal and I did a fair amount of research on vegan joints before booking a reservation. Lola Rosa did not disappoint! Samosas, burritos, curry, and the mac and cheese were all DELICIOUS. The gluten free beer option was also wonderful. The staff was friendly despite being extremely busy and our food came out quickly. 2/4 of us are not vegetarian/vegan and we all agreed that we will be back. If you haven't tried this place yet you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite restaurants in Montreal, let alone among our favorite vegetarian spots. Service is good, atmosphere good, but food is exceptional. My favourites are the burrito and the nachos, but it's all great. Recommend a reservation for table in back corner if with 3 or more people."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Lola Rosa in a few years, before tonight.  You would think that as a vegetarian, how can I pass this place up?  I'm somewhat sad to say that I'm just not that impressed.  My mixed feelings are not due to a negative experience, but rather to mediocre ones.  On paper, Lola Rosa is doing everything right.  A great selection of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menu items, even a poutine!  A bunch of great sounding desserts.  I've been conceptually enthused ever since I first heard about the place.  Unfortunately the culinary experience I've had on my several visits simply has not lived up to this promise.  The food isn't bad, but I just find it lacking, in a way that's difficult to quantify.  I'm leaning towards the hypothesis that they are a little too ambitious in throwing in ingredients.  This is something I'm guilty of in my own cooking, the difference being I don't operate a restaurant - I only need to please myself.  Some dishes don't have enough flavour, take the veggie burger and the dessert, while others like the poutine have so many competing elements that it's hard to isolate the signal from the noise.  I'm left with a feeling that something is lacking.  All this being said, it's very likely that I'll come back because I still can't resist the sound of some of these dishes!  I just need to remember to manage my expectations."}
{"text":"Charming little place, smack in the McGill ghetto with an incredible menu and selection. Their food was fantastic and the presentation is really charming. The nachos are a must try! We were a big group and were served well and they even told us that the tip had already been included which was very decent of them."}
{"text":"One of the first few restaurants that I went to since coming to Montreal for school couple years ago. The place is always bustling with customers no matter what time of the day, and is an incredibly popular spot in the McGill ghetto. The entire menu is vegan-friendly and very creative. Even for a non-vegan person the food was flavourful and enjoyable. We always try to stop here ever so often to get our healthy fix of the day. :)"}
{"text":"I write all my reviews based on a student budget:  Love this place, right next to McGill's campus with absolutely delicious meals. Very reasonably prices for the quantity and quality (usually around $17 with tip, sans drink). Only downside is it's noisy and packed pretty well all the time, so come with full lungs. But that sort of energy can be reinvigorating anyway."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa was slated to be our first meal in Montreal on our itinerary, but it ended up being our last meal instead (I don't think the hours posted on Yelp or on their website were accurate?). Regardless, we're glad we were able to try the food here.   For lunch, I ordered the burger au chanvre (hemp burger). The bbq sauce on the burger was too sweet for my taste, and the patty was on the mushier side but the side salad with chickpeas was solid. While we waited for our food to arrive, we noticed that the tables have little drawers where people kept funny notes.  Overall, my meal was reasonable priced, and I liked that there were both healthy, as well as decadent veggie options available. I saw some nearby tables order some nachos which looked and smelled enticing so I'd like to come back someday to try those.   Would come back with vegetarian and non vegetarian pals alike!"}
{"text":"Of the vegeterian places I've tried in Montreal, this is one is definitely one of the ones on the top of my list - I'm especially in love with the hemp burger!  Sadly, that also means I have not wanted to order anything else yet :/"}
{"text":"Really great find for vegan/vegetarian food!  Small, cozy place, I'm not sure if they take reservations, but if they do - definitely do that.  The menu was quite varied from burritos, to curry, to mac and cheese.  Service was incredibly efficient and super friendly.    My husband had the polenta and I had the mac and cheese which was simply amazing.  Next time I'm in Montreal this is a MUST for me.  Prices were comparable to the size/quality that you get.  Not a huge wine/beer selection, but it seemed like they had something for everyone.  Everyone seated around us was also making yummy noises so I think it's a great sign when not only you, but those seated around you love their meal!"}
{"text":"In honor of one of my good friends Ruedi coming back to Montreal for a quick visit, we decided to try out a restaurant that I have been wanting to go to for months now.  Lola Rosa is a Vegetarian (Vegan Friendly) Mexican, Comfort Food Restaurant and it has two locations.  There is one located at 545 Rue Milton and another one located at 4581 Avenue du Parc.  They also offer a delivery service but it is definitely worth going inside just for the ambiance.  There is a bohemian vibe once you enter and hanging on the walls are canvases with art of Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix and Paul McCartney done by VictArt (view his official website here or like him on Facebook here).  You are seated at wooden tables that have drawers full of random notes from previous diners, some of which were love notes... it was all pretty cozy and it is definitely my kind of place.  Since it was a Friday night, it was packed so we had to return in an hour- therefore, I highly suggest you make a reservation in advance since it is a popular spot.  Before ordering, if you are a vegetarian or vegan, be sure to follow the legend they have which tells you which dishes are suitable for you.  We started off the night by getting the pitcher of one of the beers of the night and I also tried the Lola Cocktail which was absolutely delicious.  It had a bit of tequila in it but the citrus flavor and the mint made me want a whole pitcher of that alone.  It was absolutely delicious.   For the appetizers, we shared the Portobello Farci and the Demi Lola's Nachos.  The Portobello was amazing and that is coming from someone who doesn't usually like mushrooms.  The nachos were very addictive and the portions were quite large for it being a \"half portion\" appetizer.  I would definitely get the nachos for the full meal in the future.  They were delicious.   For the main meals, we ordered the Quesadilla with mixed salad and brown basmati rice, the burrito with mixed salad and rice and the Green Curry and House Tempeh.    Every single dish was amazing.  Since the friends I went with do not usually go to vegetarian places, it was a new experience and they still really loved it.  The portions were once again massive and it was hard for us to finish our plates.  We even felt bad for leaving the few parts of leftovers we had on our plates- everything tasted so good.   We had also heard that their dessert was delicious so my friends got a coffee, a \"Hot Shot\" which is a dessert cocktail with espresso in it (yes, like its name it is in fact a shot), the Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and the Choco- Coco Pie.  The brownie was definitely better than the Pie but the pie was also amazing.  The crust had quinoa and almonds in it and the rich flavor of the chocolate mousse was enhanced with the slight taste of avocado.   This restaurant will definitely have me as a diner on several more occasions.  The staff in incredibly polite and you can tell that they really care about the service they are giving you.  It is not a place where you would want to have a \"quick bite\" since it is a laid back, unhurried atmosphere.  However, the staff does make sure to check in on the status of your order while you are waiting and the dishes are cleared almost as soon as you are done without it feeling like they are rushing you.  I am honestly so thrilled to have finally come to Lola Rosa and I can see why it is a \"Meat Lover's Favorite Vegetarian Restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Such an amazing vegan place, I recommend it to everybody! The hempburger with chick pea fries was really delicious. Also, this is the place to go if you wanna try vegan poutine!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends after a day of school work. The food is nice and in generous portion'"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant that is near McGill University. Apparently, the owners are french and they have experimented with food having taken inspiration from different cuisines. You will see this first hand when you go through the menu. A lot of the dishes seem to be from cuisines like Mexican, Indian and so on, but when you actually get them, they will taste very different to the original dish.  As soon as we got in there, we saw that it was crammed. We had to wait a few minutes for a seat. We ordered wine, chilli and a few more other dishes. All of them were based on other cuisines with verious customizations. We enjoyed every bit of them.    Also, each of the tables have desks with notes crammed in them. Had a great time reading them. Overall, it was a great evening."}
{"text":"I liked the feel of the place but nothing on the menu was actually as spicy as they claimed (mac & cheese) and the desert options were very limited. Great service though."}
{"text":"Standard food, standard service. I am a vegetarian and in my opinion, this place is definitely not worth waiting in line for an hour for. The service was quite slow and the food was okay.  We went with a big group and tried six dishes and weren't overly impressed- most of it lacked salt and flavor. The Mac and cheese was I think the best but it was more of a pesto, Alfredo pasta.  I'd say pass on this restaurant if you have can make it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place.  First impressions were that it is has a very cool vibe and seemed pretty busy even though it was way after regular lunch time.  So I couldn't wait to try the food!  Since I was by myself, the wait staff was going to put me at the bar, but it was way off to the side and nobody there.  I asked if I could have a small table.  Staff said no problem and asked me to sit in the waiting area.  Well, apparently they completely forgot about me.  I waited, and waited.  I saw two tables of twos leave.  I was patient.  Didn't want to rush them.  Maybe they haven't had a chance to bust the tables yet.  Twenty minutes, later, I walk up to the front and it's like they never saw me before.  WTF?  Okay, calm down, I told myself.  Maybe someone was new.  Maybe it is unusually busy for the time.  My chai latte came out first and it was fantastic.   Spicy, creamy, and loved their presentation.  It came in an individual French press looking contraption so you could see all the spices they used for the chai.  My hemp burger was really good.  However the chickpea fries were really greasy and the side salad looked like it had seen better days.  I love salads, but I could not get myself to eat it because it was all wilted.  Was it just under the heat lamp for too long or is this the standard?  The dressing was tasty though.  I'm debating with whether next time this happens, should I just ask for a fresher salad?  I'm always afraid the staff would do something bad with my food.  Overall, the staff was pleasant and service was good after the initial seating snafu.  As I was getting ready to leave, I realized I shouldn't be too hard on Lola Rose.  Here I was at a vegetarian restaurant with my Pajar winter coat with animal trim on the hood. Hahahaha!  What an a$#hole I am?  Sorry, but it's the only coat I have for subzero weather.  Touche, Lola Rose!"}
{"text":"Food is always great! I just got the nachos and they're probably the greatest I've had in Montreal. Fully dressed and crispy, toppings are delicious and theres cheese everywhere! I got take out and it took less then ten minutes! The mac and cheese, quesadilla and lasagna are also good AND their desserts are to die for! Def going back :)"}
{"text":"The big draw to this place is I think that they serve vegetarian and vegan but we felt the food seriously lacked any flavor. It has a great ambiance and vibe and the service was excellent. Just the food really isn't up to the mark in terms of flavor"}
{"text":"Visited there this past week. Had a burger and shared the nachos with my wife.  Both were great, though the nachos could feed 3 or 4.  Big portions on everything, so bring an appetite."}
{"text":"The food is just ok; also I'm a non vegan person  But the wait and service kill it  3h dinner is way too long for veggies.  Someone at our table even unordered a dish because it took over 1h to get"}
{"text":"Food was very different and tasteful. Definitely vegetarian friendly and unique finds. Overall really enjoyed it. Service was good but a little bit on the slower side. Regardless the atmosphere is fun and the portions of food for the price are very reasonable. Would love to come back again when we visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"I was drinking in a pub nearby with friends and, thinking my chances of getting something Vegan were slim, I Yelped and found this place 20m away. I got the Hempburger with the polenta fries and dip. Unreal. Best veggie/vegan burger I think I've ever had. Great  friendly service too. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had the vegan curry and from the first bite it was surprisingly very tasty. I didn't leave anything behind at the end of my meal, could be because it wasn't a very large plate or could be because it was so damn good. I'll go with the latter. :D I enjoyed it so much that I devoured it so very quickly. I wanted to try the hemp burger that so many yelpers raved about but they do not do any substitutions for a whole wheat or multigrain bun instead of the white bun so I went with the curry.   Had the vegan flourless L'incroyable and it is delicious! A rich chocolaty hearty dessert.   This place has a nice ambience with smooth jazz music playing in the background. Good for reading a book or gathering with friends."}
{"text":"Lovely little vegetarian restaurant ! Great drinks. I had the bourbon lemonade. We were three and all the drinks were great. The burrito and hemp burger are the best on the menu. The green curry is great too. Not too spicy. I only wish that they offered more gluten free and vegan desserts. As well as a gluten free bread for the burger. But overall good and good prices."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat here for lunch and while 4 out of 5  in the party are not vegetarian, we thought the food was outstanding and would definitely return for more!  The dishes are flavorful and portions are very generous. Surprising stand-outs are the nachos (small order was enough to be shared by 5 as a starter), the curry, burrito, quiche and the ice tea! You must try the amazing unsweetened, cinnamon, ginger, orange ice tea - it is out of this world!"}
{"text":"If I was ever a vegetarian, I would live off of this place!   I really enjoyed my experience here. Fun fact - the drawers at the table that you sit have notes in them from previous customers! Pretty neat huh?  I came here many times when I was in Montreal. All of their choices are amazing. Based on personal preference, I usually get the Three Cheese & Spinach Lasagne or the Burrito or the Quesadilla. You will either be surprised that vegetarian food can taste this good or forget that this was even a vegetarian restaurant.   On top of the food, the restaurant as a home like atmosphere. It is really relaxing and a cozy little place to have dinner. The staff here are also extremely welcoming and exceptional. All portions are generous, fairly priced and extremely tasty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.It is a completely vegetarian restaurant with delicious food!   It's right next to McGill University and is very comfortable. They have quaint tables with little drawers in them filled with notes from people who have visited them over the years. It is fun to read the notes. The entire place has a warm and inviting ambiance.   The owner's sister served us and was incredibly friendly and thoughtful. She gave us great recommendations, shared recipes and was very cheerful and positive. We were there for a good two hours and had a great time.   We were very hungry and ordered a lot of food. We were three people and ordered the samosas, two chilis and one burrito. We also ordered the craft beer. They were gigantic portion sizes, we could have ordered just two items and been extremely satisfied. We had a huge to-go box filled with delicious food when we left.   Craft Beer (L'alchemiste): A very balanced and fruity amber beer, we really enjoyed it. It almost had a mango tinge to it, which was surprising.   Samosa: Absolutely delicious.It wasn't a traditional samosa by any means but a modern version filled with vegetables. The accompanying salad was the highlight of the evening. It had greens, carrots and beets. The dressing was tart, sweet and unbelievably tasty. I am not a big salad fan but I could eat that salad and dressing all day. So so good.   Chili: The chili was flavorful, satisfying and delightful. We tried our best to finish them but we couldn't and packed almost 3/4th of the portion.   Burrito: Another fantastic entree. The burrito was filled with lovely, unexpected flavors. It paired very well with the beer too.   We were enveloped in an aura of contentment at the end of this meal. If we are in Montreal again, we will make sure to make a pilgrimage to this place and try the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"How good is Lola Rosa? Let's just say that I've met carnivores who would recommend it.   The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, but has something for everyone. Personal favourites are the poutine and the nachos. But be warned, the large nacho plate is enough to feed a small army. Seriously, we got one between three people and were barely able to finish. Granted, we each had a small poutine first, but that besides the point.   Anyway, I can't recommend this place enough. Check it out!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLES services. N'ont aucun sense de service à clientèle , serveuse hostile et pas aimable du tout . Bonne chance si vous y allez !"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4 stars.   Ordered takeout on a weekday and it was only a 10 minute wait. They have many locations for your convenience all over the city.   When I arrived to pick up my food, the place was packed. I would assume at least a 20 min wait (not sure if they accept reservations). It had a very authentic and lively vibe. The servers were friendly and helped me get my takeout fast and efficiently.   I decided on a burrito made with avocado and beans. I was craving some comfort food and this definitely hit the spot. The burrito was prepared perfectly - stuffed to the makes with vegetable goodness. Oh btw this place is entirely vegetarian.   The meal came with some sides too salad and rice....the rice was perfectly fluffy and so delicious. Extremely flavourful and very authentic.  In all a solid takeout spot!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I'm not a vegetarian by any standards I really like this place.  It's small and got an eclectic vibe to it which I'm a fan of.  Foodwise what Lola Rosa lacks in meat it makes up for in flavour.  I usually get the polenta or the quesadillas and they always hit the spot.  Everything always has lots of flavour to it.  The veggie lasagna also doesn't disappoint.  I\"ve also tried the hemp burger which I wasn't the biggest fan of but it's really the only time I've never been satisfied with something I ate here.  Their desserts are always worth trying.  I've had the pumpkin pie, the apple crisp, the banana chocolate pie and I've enjoyed them all.  In fact it's always hard to narrow down the selection to just one.  It can be crowded on a weekend night but usually if you go during the week you get seated right away.  The service is also pretty good"}
{"text":"Good food if you prefer a vegetarian cuisine. The Nachos are filling & worth the price. The curry item is good too. The beer options are kinda average."}
{"text":"Friendly service and food at a great value that pleases even the biggest carnivores! I came here on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm and it was pretty packed. We had a reservation but otherwise we would have had to wait a bit. We were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. The tables are cute and the decor in the restaurant is very stylish. I ordered the quesadilla, my partner ordered the Cajun burger and his parents ordered one of the salads and hemp burger. We all loved our meals and found them to be very well presented. I didn't find the quesadilla super filling but it was still a nice portion for the price. We had the brownie and ice cream for dessert which was delish. I'm sure we'll be back! Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Value 4/5 Atmosphere 5/5"}
{"text":"Cute spot for tasty vegetarian food.  The locations is smaller than the other one I've been to but the size contributed to the laid back vibe. We ordered the large nachos to share. It was gigantic and more than enough for 4-6 people. It is topped with tons of ingredients and all the flavours go together very well. I had the hemp burger which was yummy but a little mushy. I'm not sure I'd order that again.  The service was fast and friendly.   Tip: Don't drive there, you won't find parking easily."}
{"text":"When my friends heard Lola Rosa is a vegetarian restaurant, they refused to go. I had heard nothing but good things about this place but there was nothing I could do to convince them otherwise. I finally got the chance to go and boy are they missing out! We started with a demi portion of nachos - the best nacho dish in Montreal. This is not an exaggeration. This demi portion puts all other full portion sizes to shame as it is a heaping pile of crispy nachos covered with beets, avocado, chilli, cheese, black beans, and other goods. For two people this is a meal on its own, but I ordered the seitan and black bean burger and really did enjoy it. I was not too crazy about the side of chick peas it came with but I really liked the salad dressing (whatever it was). My girlfriend ordered the seitan tacos dressed with coriander and spicy mayo. The one bite she let me have was tasty, though I found the seitan to be overpowering.   Lola Rosa is a very affordable restaurant with top quality menu items that fill you up. Their dishes are packed with fresh flavours that stand out. Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Great place!! I had the nachos small serving which was massive and delicious, my husband had the cheese hemp burger which he loved   The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great!!  When I go back to Montreal I will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Lola Rosa n'est probablement pas aussi bon pour la santé que Crudessence ou Aux Vivres. Mais c'est bon tout court! Le menu est essentiellement composé de spécialités inspirées de la cuisine mexicaine et de l'indienne: quesadilla, burrito, curry, etc. Osez essayer la sauce piquante! Le personnel est très sympathique et souriant et, en été, la terrasse est agréable. Alcool également disponible avec une sélection de vins et de bières plutôt correcte. À essayer si vous êtes à la recherche d'une option végétarienne (ou végétalienne) mais avez un craving pour de la \"comfort food\"! We've all been there. ;) Au passage, si vous êtes assis à l'intérieur, ouvrez les tiroirs de la table pour découvrir des notes écrites par d'autres clients (et laissez la vôtre!). Autre fun fact appris récemment: le pain des burgers est fait maison!"}
{"text":"Un peu difficile de faire une critique sur ce restaurant, car si beaucoup de choses m'ont plues ici, ce n'est pas le cas du service qui laisse assez à désirer. Tout d'abord, j'y suis allée plusieurs fois avec une amie durant le mois de janvier afin de pouvoir gouter leur galette des rois végétalienne, l'ennui c'est qu'il n'y en avait jamais quand nous y allions. Nous avons aussi essayer d'en commander une mais la première fois, notre commande avait été oubliée, nous nous sommes donc rendues au restaurant pour la prendre pour rien, et la seconde fois, la personne au téléphone nous demandait de payer directement pour prendre notre commande et vu notre première mésaventure nous n'avons pas pris de risque. Nous y sommes toutefois retournées afin de prendre un dessert et un café, et là aussi, même si les serveurs/euses sont très souriants et accueillants, ils ne sont pas pour autant efficaces. Nous avons dû attendre assez longtemps alors que nous n'avions commandé que deux cafés et une part de gâteau et que le restaurant était vide. Toutefois, le gâteau et le café était excellents (et toute la carte faisait envie). Le restaurant en lui-même est très joli, avec des bancs, des tables en bois, des étagères avec des livres,... et grand, on peut donc y venir en groupe et ne pas s'y sentir à l'étroit.  Bref, si j'ai aimé y manger, je n'ai pas aimé y être servie !"}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients. But if vegetarian/vegan is not your thing, you won't enjoy it. Nachos is the best option to eat. Quebec sangria is great!"}
{"text":"This place is really good when you go eat there but their take out system isn't so great. Took a very long time. they told me my meal came with guacamole but forgot to put it, and the salad was not very good. The burrito was delicious, though"}
{"text":"I came here with friends while visiting Montréal. This restaurant is primarily vegetarian, with items that can be made vegan clearly marked on the menu. I got a quesadilla (vegan option), and my husband had some curry (also vegan). The quesadilla was more of an avocado-dilla and was kinda soggy (they put a lot of red sauce on top of it), but I still enjoyed it. The curry was amazing. I just wish more items were vegan."}
{"text":"Still a 4 star review, second time here was pleasant.  It's always SUPER busy every time I've been here. One time we decided to pass up here cause it was too busy lined up outside haha.   Food: this 2nd time was solid food again, and was enjoyable. My chai tea latte was great, the daily soup was tasty, and the half order of nachos I shared was great but it feel like it wasn't as good as the last time I was here. But still good nonetheless!   Cool: I found in my table (there all old school desks it seems) and the drawer in my table had all these handwritten notes in it and so did my persons across from me. The notes had random stories, peoples thoughts experiences, and even random love notes etc haha it was great and made me smile !   Hopefully it I come here again in the future if I'm in Montreal again. I can update this to 5 stars!   If your in the area and are young I recommend checking this place out. For the older crowd, not sure if it's so great for you. Noisy and full of young people. But hey good food!"}
{"text":"Petit resto végé dans le Ghetto McGill, assez populaire auprès des étudiants et aussi très bruyant. Je pense que c'est toujours comme ça. Difficile de s'entendre, le soir venu. Niveau bouffe, mon burrito végétarien était bon, le service était bien & rapide. J'y retournerai probablement mais aux périodes hors affluence."}
{"text":"Excellent find!! The poutine is amazing! The Sangra blanche is a must try. We tried the Quesadilla and the burrito and both were very flavorful and unique!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Veggie heaven.  This small one room place was packed even though McGill was out of session.  Service was courteous although the wait staff hardly could keep up.  We had the lasagna layered with three cheeses and spinach (excellent), red curry thai tofu, and demi nachos which was enough for two dinners.  dessert was creme brûlée which must be great since my daughter refused to share any with me.  All were great!    The only downside?  Place was kind of hot and decor was basement pine."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan and gluten-free options. Love the ragout and the Salade Rosa is amazing. Don't forget the vegan/gluten-free desserts; the incroyable really is."}
{"text":"I was very amazed by their yummy nachos with black beans, mozzarella, pepper, very refreshening and tasty! Curry and tomato pie were average, but very filling. The restaurant is very popular and quite busy on Friday night, fortunately they take reservation so you can call ahead of time to save a table. The service is quite good and the waiters quite helpful. I like the stylish \"mascot\" Mr Skeleton that they put in front of the restaurant, really all cute!"}
{"text":"Est-il vraiment possible de proposer une poutine végétalienne ? Qui plus est super bonne ?  La réponse est OUI et c'est au Lola Rosa qu'on la trouve !  Je n'ai même pas pu terminer car la portion est plutôt énorme mais je n'ai qu'une idée en tête, y retourner pour recommencer !!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  A true delight for a vegetarian and her meat-loving husband- He ordered the nachos, I had the burrito.  The nachos were top-notch!  My burrito was good - there was a slightly strange sweet (almost fruity) flavor in the sauce in one end of the burrito (I'm not a big fan of fruit), but working through the burrito, the taste subsided and was replaced with yummy black beans, corn and sweet potatoes.  Coming from the SW, not your usual Mexican fare, but that's what made this place unique and enjoyable.  Highly recommend the nachos!  (Also, check out the drawers at your table and enjoy all the hand-written notes, stories, advice)"}
{"text":"I was a fan of their food. But I recently went to the place again with my friends and it was not upto my expectations. The proportion size has decreased and the presentation is not as enticing as it was earlier. The nachos were not that fresh and the cheese cake was not the same. Even the chocolate banana cake has changed. It seems that the cook has changed and I preferred the older one."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places to eat, as they accommodate both vegans and celiacs. The food was amazing. Their nachos are my favourite. Our server was also extremely attentive and accommodating. Although, the service is usually inconsistent. I've been several times and have received very poor customer service. The best part is that the Milton location is located just east of McGill's downtown campus, which is super convenient. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Order the samosas Good place to start off. My favourite here is the hemp burger."}
{"text":"Best nachos in the entire world! Huge portions though. Vegan but tastes amazing. Definitely get Lola's Nachos and sangria"}
{"text":"Nouvelle expérience végé reussie ! Jolie salle, carte allechante. Choix d'une quesadilla absolument divine (et copieuse). Mes compagnons ont opté pour le tajine et le chili, tous deux excellents mais un peu petits pour leur estomac. Prix raisonnables. Une bonne adresse ! (Bémol: Service un peu lent et pas ultra nice...m'enfin)"}
{"text":"My favorite vegetarian place in Montreal. The service is always good and the food too! My favorite is the burrito. I find that their McGill location is better than on Parc though!"}
{"text":"Love Lola Rosa, and this location is my favorite of the two locations because it's much bigger and the atmosphere is superb (good for groups. Good for dates. Good for hanging out with a friend or two). The menu is a little different from Lola Rosa Milton and I prefer it (I mean... chick pea fries with vegan aioli. *Mic drop*).   When I'm traveling and feel like I love restaurant, I go often (see: Aux Vivres). I hit up Lola Rosa Parc two times because the food is really good and their wine list is lengthier (including a sparkling). And yes, everyone talks about the nachos. They are *that* divine, but there's a whole lot of other wonderful things here (those fries! I die!) and their veg burgers (there's a hemp burger and often a second special. Among the world veggie burger hall of famers! Get this if you're really hungry. It comes with the chick pea fries). The only thing I don't recommend is the tagine, because I found the flavor to be bland and I really didn't like the flavor and consistency of the seitan (odd because the seitan in the tacos at Lola Rosa Milton is phenomenal!)   Finally, there are vegan desserts, people. Extremely rich, decadent vegan desserts. Also GF options that I can't speak to but I always notice that they are there.  Similar to Lola Rosa Milton, service here is really just so very nice and lovely. We knew we had to try the vegan chocolate cake when our server dropped an F bomb to describe how incredible it is. This foul-mouthed New Yorker always appreciates a well-dropped F bomb."}
{"text":"While the emphasis at Lola Rosa is vegetarian rather than vegan, they do accommodate those of us who eschew cheese and eggs quite well. I tried both Lola locations and much prefer the location on Avenue du Parc because I prefer the ambiance. The space is larger and it's not quite as loud. The menu differs from location to location (more vegan options at Lola Rosa Parc). That said, both restaurants employ lovely staff who are accommodating and attentive. They are doing something right!  If you come on in the evening, do make reservations at this location. I arrived at 9pm and the entire place was packed, save for one table, the one we had reserved. Not only was it packed, but as I mentioned before, extremely loud, to the point where we pretty much were shouting at each other (and, unfortunately, the waitress. I hate being rude). I much preferred the place an hour later when the crowd had left.   On to the menu... it's well-edited. Nothing too creative or out of this world about it, which isn't always a bad thing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a curried chickpea soup. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. I'm not a fan of completely pureed soups in general and this also needed salt. Next up, the tacos. What is really outstanding about them is the seitan, which is perfectly chewy without being rubbery and bursting with flavor. Seitan is often so bland and boring. This is the great kind! I just wish there was more of it in the tacos.   Lola Rosa Parc has out-of-this-world phenomenal chickpea fries. I mean... the kind of fries that you're compelled to burn your mouth on. This location does not have them. I love those fries so much that I'm mentioning them in a review for Lola Rosa Milton, so there ya go!  But what that other location doesn't have that this one does have is the Twix bar vegan dessert... a dessert in a league (or paragraph) of its own! Normally I'm too full from dinner to order dessert, but to be honest, I wasn't really in love with anything I ordered so room, I had aplenty and that's kind of serendipitous because this dessert is that insanely good."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan nachos that will blow your socks off! Great ambiance and friendly bilingual staff! Felt at home right away great menu!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once, and food and service were great. I will be back. I recommend the curry! Their amber beer was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I love Lola Rosa and the idea behind this restaurant, so when a Vegetarian Prof. came to visit us (research group) I immediately taught about this place. Not a great idea looking back. We preordered a place for 11 people (a week in advence) when we got to place it was almost empty they first placed us in a nice big table but 5 min later moved us to a smaller one (for 8 although we were more people). Btw the big table was empty all night. After we finished eating they asked us if we want dessert when we took our time they said that they need table so if we dont want anything else they will appreciate it if we leave. A nice way to kick out a paying customer ( we just finished dinner for 11+lots of pitchers). I love the milton location but will avoid the park one after this experience. The only ray of sun is that the food is good (hence not one star)."}
{"text":"This is the type of places I love. The food is always fresh, healthy, well prepared and tasty. No take great food (Vegetarian and vegan options) add great atmosphere which is a mixture between student and trendy and you got yourself a winner.  I ate here a view times, the salads are great the curry is spicy but you would be able to stop eating. The meals might not seem huge but you wont leave this place hungry, this is an awasome place to go alone, with friends, family or even a bussness meeting. Also I love the drawers with all the funny notes that each table has."}
{"text":"Lola Rosa is our favorite place in Montreal!! Delicious food, a quirky ambiance, and lovely staff. A trip to Montreal is never complete without at trip to Lola Rosa!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for lunch today and overall had a pretty decent experience. One of us ordered the nachos which were huge and tasty, two of us had the quesadilla and I had the hemp burger with a side of Poutine. My burger was okay but the patty itself was on the squishy side. Poutine was also okay, I felt the gravy was a little grainy. However, everything else was good. Our server seemed a little sullen and not very welcoming but maybe he was having an off day. I'd probably come back but I'd order something different."}
{"text":"Like latino flavour? Like tasty food \"menos la carne\"? Like casuals places, intimates places; well that's your place.  Latinos classics with mix with the vegan trend. Small, really small place but certainly worth the detour."}
{"text":"Filling portions, healthy options and really delicious--no wonder the place is always packed! I took the burrito and it was amazing. It was kind of unusual that they used sweet potato inside but nevertheless that slight sweetness made it unique and flavorful!   PS: Take the quebec sangria over the red. Trust me--it's soo good!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little vegetarian restaurant that makes tasty food! Very generous portions! Homemade everything! It's fairly crowded and loud at lunch hours, because you know, it's near McGill! The staff is very kind! You may feel cramped in there but that's not what's important! It's the food! I would personally come back even though I am not a vegan but it opened my eyes on those vegan meals. I learned that you don't need meat to make a dish delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Another vegan restaurant I tried with my vegan friends. Incase you havent read my Chu Chai resto review; I'm not vegan.   I had the mac and cheese and It was good but not the greatest. It had a crunch to it which I liked but it was a little bland. The burritos my friends were having seemed alot better than my pick.   The ambiance is very cozy and I loveeee the note drawers. My friend found a note she wrote 2 years ago. I really loved that concept.   The deserts arent really worth it. I would suggest to skip them."}
{"text":"The food isn't gross but it's nothing noteworthy. I felt it lacked much flavour, I suppose in part due to the lack of seasoning.  I also didn't enjoy the tables. The seats weren't the most comfortable and the table sat significantly higher than my seat, so leaning over was not enjoyable.  Overall a very \"meh\" spot. I would go back just for casual drinks with friends, but wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Quality for this chain seems to vary a bit from location to location, but service is always good and they have what are easily the BEST vegan nachos around. The beer selection is small but full of good options. Lola Rosa is always a good bet for some veggie/vegan eats!"}
{"text":"There are a few meals you have in life where everything goes right. This was one of those nights. I couldn't decide on a single dish and I shouldn't have. I had the mac n cheese and the curry and both were some of the best dishes I've had.   This was one of the best restaurants I've ever been. I'm not vegetarian but this restaurant showed me that I could. You need to try this place."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant.  It was truly exceptional vegetarian food - so many people turn up their noses when they hear the word \"vegetarian,\" but this place would change that in an instant.  We shared the burrito and a half order of nachos - the burrito was just spicy enough and was filled with black beans, cheese, and a terrific sauce.  It was accompanied with rice and a salad.  The nachos were delicious and a half serving was more than enough for two people.  The nachos were covered with a wonderful mixture of black beans, corn, chopped tomatoes, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and special salsa. The chips were crispy and not overly salty.  We were given a carafe of water to start, which was refilled promptly.  Our waiter was informative, friendly, and efficient.  If I had to say one thing negative about Lola Rosa on Parc is that it was a bit noisy, but certainly not enough to keep us from returning.  Five stars and a yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I honestly think it's pretty overrated. Service is always pretty slow, and food is rather bland. The Parc location is by far superior. I also had friend who had A/C condensation dripping in her food, and another with a cockroach in her nachos. Both were only offered a 10% off coupon for their next visit...  I personally probably won't be going back after hearing the cockroach story, but their jalapeño/spinach mac & cheese is decent, as is their house salad dressing. The nachos are okay, also over-rated."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and based on yelp reviews I tried this.  Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed!     Service was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food ingredients and asked for allergies.   Ambience was great    so cozy!     The tables have drawers with notes from past patrons   You must try hemp burger!   Amazing      I am so happy I stumbled on this on yelp!   It was worth the ten miles trek from my hotel."}
{"text":"One of the finer vegan/ vegetarian restaurant that I have been too! We waited for about 5 minutes on a Friday night which wasn't bad! Ordered the curry and Burrito to end with the green tea cake. The curry was okay, nothing out of the world, but the burrito was by far one of the best ones I have had. The green tea cake was out of the world too! Moist in its texture with a light flavor of the matcha powder, topped with coconut cream."}
{"text":"Great hippie vibes, good hearty vegetarian food, the nachos are a must. Take care not to over order because the portions are BIG, even the half portions are big. Reasonable prices, and good service The only issue I had with this place were the flies and bugs. During the summer the windows are open, with no AC or fans or anything of the sorts, and flies were all over our food. It felt like I spent the entire time fanning over our meals."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends, one who is vegan.   Upon arrival, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was very empty on this Tuesday evening. At the busiest time, about 5 tables were occupied.   We started by sharing some vegan nachos. I saw all the reviews saying how delicious it was, so I had high expectations, but it fell so short! The cashew cheese, was not great. It kind of tasted like mustard. But to be fair, I've never had cashew cheese before, so I don't know if it's supposed to taste like this. There quantity to toppings for the amount of chips is decent. My biggest concern was that the chips were soggy! When we got to the chips at the bottom, we had to scoop them up with our forks, because they were so soggy! The chips were sitting in an actually puddle of (tomato?) juice!   After that, I had the burrito. It was good! It had really nice flavours. However, the portion of rice and salad on the side was a little disappointing.   My friend's Cajun burger also fell short. It was very oily, but it came with a good portion of fries.   The service was okay. Two of us got there early and the waitress kept asking us to order. It was nice when she first asked, but after the fourth time, it started getting a little bothersome. Also, we finished our water rather quickly and we never got a refill. Here, I would like to remind you that it was not busy at all. The staff was actually talking amongst themselves most of the time.   To sum it up, it was a disappointing experience. I might try to Lola Rosa on Milton next time, but this supper was a real let down."}
{"text":"Love this place. From the amazing food, staff and atmosphere to the drawers of art, this place is a must. Vegetarian done right and at its best."}
{"text":"Located on the outskirts of McGill's campus, Lola Rosa is the perfect destination for someone looking for a quality vegetarian meal. I got the burrito which was delicious! As someone who eats meat at every single meal, I have always been skeptical about vegetarian food; however I always leave satisfied when I order the burrito. The portion size is hefty and the presentation of the food is phenomenal. My only critique is that the food could be a bit more flavorful, however that issue is fixed when you put the hot sauce on the burrito.   While the food I received was excellent, the service was not up to par. My friend and I were seated at the same table as a boisterous party of four, and when we asked our waitress to be seated at a separate table they claimed that the table was \"reserved\", however no one showed up to take the table the whole time we were there. In addition, when I asked for hot sauce for my burrito, I was told that it costs 50 cents, even though the previous four times I've been to this restaurant it's been free of charge."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great soup and chai tea . Fun atmosphere and good service! Salads are very generous!!"}
{"text":"Ma fille m'a invité à ce resto végé  et vegan pour ma fête. Excellent! Très bon service bon ambiance et une belle variété  de mets."}
{"text":"Good lunch place. The Putin was good especially the sauce and my date was happy with his burger. The tartare was good but a bit too much sauce and the crackers (gluten free option) a bit boring... still good though. The chocolate indulgence was nice and i was happy to share it... it kept me going for hours. The service was impeccable"}
{"text":"This is vegetarian first before it is vegan. But all dishes come with vegan options and packed full of flavours!!!! I ordered the curry, I couldn't resist. It was deeeelicious. Excellent service. The restaurant is full all the time even when the neighbourhood is pin-dropping quiet."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian and vegan options from dinner to dessert to drinks! Our table shared the nachos (amazing sauce & beans) and I tried the sweet potato & avocado quesadillas which were great, albeit a touch too sweet. My favourite part however was the Matcha-Passionfruit cake with chia icing which was light and refreshing and a perfect end to the meal! Next time I will definitely visit to share a half-plate of nachos since the portions were huge and at a great price!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in Montreal. I live right behind it so it is very convenient! I think the staff is starting to recognize me I come so much!   First of all, THE LOLA NACHOS! These are amazing! They are perfect for sharing (especially the full size...HUGE) and they are so very delicious! I have gotten them so many times and my friends love them too.   The soups of the days are always enjoyable. My favourite thus far has been the sweet potato soup! So tasty! I could drink that stuff!   The Lola Salad is really good although sometimes I've gotten it with a bit too many peppers for my liking. The dressing is yummy and the avocado and chick peas with the essence of the olive is delightful!    The burrito is pretty good but honestly I'd rather go with the nachos if I'm in the mood for something like that because they're better.   I have yet to try the poutine, but I've tried the sweet potato fries. Pretty good. They are mixed with golden fries. I liked them but wasn't amazed by them.   I have a soft spot for the chickpea fries! I find them so tasty although sometimes I think they can be a little undercooked! Regardless, I always eat them and can't get enough of the sauce!   The mac n cheese is wonderful! A bit on the spicier side (I think it has green chiles in them) but so great! Each dish is individual cooked and has bread crumbs on top!   The brownie with ice cream was okay. Not as good as I was expecting but hit the spot for chocolate cravings.   The ambiance is awesome! All of the tables are little desks and you can open the drawers and leave notes inside and read other people's notes. So fun! There are also several books. And there is a bar too if you are into that.   You can order take out too just walk up to the bar and order. I think they also deliver.   Sometimes they get really busy so a reservation on a weekend evening is not a bad idea.   Awesome place! Great food! Happy me."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars but I can't. For a vegan resto it's not bad, I never thought I can like this type of restaurants as I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian . I had the nachos and it was one of the best I've eaten in a long time, it's a bit pricy though. The Service was slow, it took forever to get my food, other then that no real complaints. Worth trying one time"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!  The staff, the food, the beer, the prices, the little notes in the table drawers, the garage door open for a fresh breeze on a warm spring evening."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Lola Rosa for a couple of years, and have now been back twice in the past two weeks. I am the furthest thing from a vegetarian but this place still manages to leave me very satisfied.   Two weeks ago I ordered the burrito with avocado on top, which was excellent. But I am a sucker for Mac & Cheese so when I saw it on the recently added portion of their menu, I had to indulge. The Mac & Cheese had spinach and jalapeno in it--giving it the perfect amount of kick. We also had the infamous nachos to share as an app--the half portion was plenty for three!  Pro tip: This place is small and almost always packed--go a bit earlier or later than peak meal hours and avoid going here with a big group. Don't forget to check the drawers of the tables--they're full of notes from previous diners!"}
{"text":"Nachos are probably the best item on the menu. If you want something filling get the lasagna. The dessert was pretty good. All the table have little drawers, the drawers have messages in them. Overall quite satisfied :)"}
