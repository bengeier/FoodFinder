{"text":"i give it one star for the excellent service. however, shortly after eating & not having left the restaurant, my stomach began to ache, draining my energy. i had the worse indigestion and experience for the next few hours. my husband began to have the same signs & symptoms about 2 hours after leaving the restaurant, still waking up feeling sick this morning. as he said it ... \"never again.\""}
{"text":"To start off, the place made a bad first impression. There was a rude employee answering the phone when i called to reserve a table. Had to wait 45 min due to a mistake on the restaurants part. However, once we were seated everything was great. 

I ordered the Hawaiian sticky ribs. The manager Phil came over and apologized that they were taking so long. He stated that the plate was not made properly, and he wouldn't let it leave the kitchen. That is how you do it in the food industry... If its not right, don't send it out and apologize to your patrons.

All in all the management was great, and all of the food was great. They definitely redeemed themselves for this 5 star rating. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been a go to place for our office team lunch. 
The lunch specials are really good. The lunch specials have 2-3 vegetarian options for people like me. The price is right. The food is good. Ambience is festive. Over all good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Food was really good and service was excellent thanks to Megan and the rest of the crew. My husband and uncle are both picky eaters but they loved the Black & Bleu burger and fish & chips they ordered.

I enjoyed my Maggie's Snake River Salad, took a bite of my aunt's walnut chicken salad sandwich and I loved that too! Will be going back there one day soon"}
{"text":"Another good meal at Lazy Dog!   Tried the black and blue burger and it didn't disappoint!  Did I mention the desserts are awesome too! The service was stellar as well.  Our server, John was attentive and on it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome prices! Jennifer was an AMAZING server even though we were very indecisive!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is great!! It's new and close to airport. I'll come back for its happy hour and dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight to catch the Kentucky vs. Notre Dame game in the bar.  Our server, Derrick, was attentive and gave great recommendations.  Had a REALLY nice Ginger Soy Salmon cooked to a perfect medium rare.  And, the Maker's Manhattans eased the nerves during a particularly tense game!  

Great food, even better service.  Highly recommended and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Downtown Summerlin... Great food, great atmosphere, great service... You can't go wrong! I'm looking forward to the weather getting a little cooler so we can sit by their large fire pit they have on the patio. Whether you are going for lunch, dinner or even their weekend brunch you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog has become my new favorite restaurant. 

It helps that it is close to my home. 
I've been ordering 2-3 of the \"Small Plates\" as. Meal. They're great!

Today I had the Street Corn Wheels. They flavorful with the cheese etc. 

The Spicy Buffalo Chicken Lollipops are good chunks of meat. The accompanying slaw was a good balance for the buffalo sauce. 

The Cast Iron Turkey meatballs are my favorite. They are super tasty. The marinara sauce 

House made Ginger Beer is really strong, almost too much. Get it only if you really like ginger.  

I've had many other things on their menu and all were good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything was good. The Chicken Poblano was more spicy than normal but still good. It was not too busy, seated our party of 6 pretty quick.  Server was on top of things.  All in all, good experience.  Recommend the  Chicken Poblano."}
{"text":"You don't always get what you pay for.

We ordered the All American Burger with the Garden Burger substitute.  The menu describes the All American as having two (2) patties.  It came out with one patty.  Instead of apologizing, some assistant manager endlessly insisted that the All American only has one patty.  Read the freaking menu- the word \"Two\" is the very first word in the description.

Oh but there is more.  I ordered wings.  I'm still waiting for them.  Lazy Dog gave me a final bill but not an itemized statement.  You can guess what happened next.  When we requested the itemized statement, we were billed for the wings.  The bartender said, \"oh, you never got the wings?\"  

I guess the wings are with the missing veggie patty."}
{"text":"Had a pretty terrible dinner here. Waitress was very good although two of our dishes were mixed up and we had to wait. I ordered the Cajun fries which were mediocre at best, buffalo nuggets which tasted over flavored and a bit artificial which surprised me because the waitress said that most of the menu was all made fresh. Also had the crispy Brussels sprouts which were salty and drenched in Parmesan and just too overwhelming to enjoy. We also received complimentary flatbread which was awful and chewy like rubber. Honestly the only saving grace for me was the lemonade drinks which were delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I just returned from a birthday dinner for me at Lazy Dog's in Summerlin.

First, I want to give a shout-out to Amanda, our server, who could not have been nicer or better at her job. She is delightful, and we will ask for her when we return to the restaurant.

Next, I must say that Lazy Dog's in Summerlin has become our go-to restaurant. The food is great, the service is always excellent, the ambiance is pleasant and the prices are good. 

And finally, kudos to the management team. You are either hiring wonderful people, training them really well, or both."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of other lazy dogs in SoCal and knew what to expect regarding the quality of good at LD's. This location does not disappoint in the food department. But I have to knock off a couple of stars regarding the disjointed and frankly, poor curbside service."}
{"text":"Well... well... well... the food is always bomb. Like Hiroshima bomb. But the service is poop. Like diarrhea poop from a man with IBS who just ate spicy Indian food. But really the food is worth the awful service and anger."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars.  We sat outside with the heaters going.  You still need to bring a sweater though.  There was a wait if you wanted to sit inside which is not unusual anywhere in Summerlin on a Saturday night.

I started off with a Greens, eggs and ham.  It was a very fun small dish. It had small broccoli pieces, bacon (no ham) and a poached egg.  It's great for sharing.  The rest of the family had different culinary items varying from Italian (Chicken Parm and Pizza) to Mexican (Carne Asada) to Caribbean   Chicken.  Everyone loved their food.  

The Caribbean Chicken had a jerk sauce that while definitely not authentic was a nice hearty portion pared with thinly sliced cucumbers with a zesty sauce and rice.  It went well together.  They also serve Chinese food there also with a twist (I didn't try it).

If you are tired of eating the same old stuff, go to Lazy Dogs.  It's American Cuisine that's really good.  Oh yeah, people can bring their dogs to the restaurant outside.  All the dogs were well behaved."}
{"text":"I tried this place not too long after first opening. It was delicious and the service was very attentive. Every time after that has been a rapid decline in the quality of both portion and food. I was very much looking forward to the pulled pork sandwich that I devoured the first time I enjoyed this place. The second time there was a noticeable difference in the amount of pulled pork on the sandwich, I thought to give it another try... Tonight I left hungry. It felt like I was eating bread and BBQ sauce more than anything. I ate less than half. Very disappointed. Especially when my girlfriend let me know her salad was overdressed and soggy. Where this place used to be an easy 4 stars at their launch, it is quickly becoming a spot to not return to."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to grab an appetizer and a few drinks to finish up the football game. Absolutely great food! They have small plates so you can share AND they have a nutritious menu for anyone counting calories. We had the buffalo chicken nuggets with blue cheese slaw. I am personally not a big blue cheese fan but my husband loved it! The bites were on point! Also....gotta try the sweet potato bites with jalepeno aoli!!!  Come on in and check it out! Affordable and great staff along with delicious choices!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here! Good food, fast service and nice ambience! It was really more than what I expected for the price. I came with my friend and we both split a blue cheese burger with tons of fries, a small plate of mac and cheese which was so delicious and wrapped it up with butter cake topped with ice cream and surrounded by some raspberry (i think) sauce. Every bite was delicious! I'm definitely going back next week."}
{"text":"Love Lazy Dog, Awesome Sangria, fish tacos, salads, hummus appetizer!!!!! Go there as often as we can."}
{"text":"Terri is so lit and works nightshifts at the bar. I loved the burger on the happy hour menu after 9 PM. If you love something fruity, mistaken for water, and alcoholic get the White Peach Sangria. Just do it. Literally. I'll go here tomorrow."}
{"text":"We are instantly impressed with our new fave spot. Anyone living West of 215 near Charleston needs to check this out. It is an open area but cozy also. It is in the Summerlin mall area,easy to get to and park. Food is great... Beer selection will keep us coming back! Outside seating - duh! For anyone from the Midwest! Heidi was an excellent server, informative and friendly!"}
{"text":"Rarely ever leave reviews. Had to this time.

Called from the hotel next door to see if they had a soccer game on. The guy on the phone put me on hold while he found it and then invited us over before they opened to watch the early start. The rest of the staff reflected the man on the phone. 

Real customer service is alive and well here."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this gem of a restaurant. Apparently they make all of their dishes from scratch which is impressive considering our food came out rather quick (mind you, we got sandwiches). The service was above and beyond excellent. The gentleman who served us was extremely kind and patient and he gave us amazing recommendations. I had the roasted chicken and Havarti sandwich which was phenomenal. My husband loved his pot roast sandwich. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here...wife and I sat at the bar. Food was absolutely awesome. You gotta try the calamari appetizer,,,sooo good! Meat loaf entree was excellent, very flavorful. However, the best part was the service..SHANNON took great care of us!! We will be back...soon!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. My friend and I were both sick with colds so our waiter suggested complementary hot water with lemon slices and honey. Have eaten here several times and food is consistently good. Large bar area and outside patio, dining room can get noisy so ask for quieter booth. Good meet up place because it is on outside corner with ample parking."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat for lunch, dinner and the Sunday brunch. Diverse menu with decent adult beverage  selection. It is definitely a frequent stop on the going out to eat circuit."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my recent visit to Lazy Dog's. Our waiter Joey was very accommodating and professional. He helped me through the menu because I was so undecided. After a few suggestions I decided on the chicken poblano which was out of this world.   I even splurged on the apple cobbler which Joey recommended. It was the best I've had in years. My husband and I will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Nice place with a good atmosphere but crazy slow service.  Our waitress while super nice was not at attentative.  After our apps we had to practically beg someone to take our plates away.  Asking for water was at least 15 min.  We weren't in a rush so it wouldn't have been that bad.  We complained about all the apps because they were not very good at all and did get a nice \"thanks for your feedback\".  I had the new schnitzel and it was awful.  Pounded so thin that there was more breading then meat."}
{"text":"Uniformly mediocre. 5 out of 6 dishes were nearly tasteless. Poblano Chicken was dry and flavorless. Nice wait staff. But I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been here three times.  First two times were pretty good, last time not so much.  We let the host talk us into getting a hi-top table in the bar rather than a table in the restaurant.  That was the mistake.  It seemed like there was only one server for the tables in the bar area.  Aside from being slow, she also didn't give us credit for the free appetizer we got from them via e-mail.  And after waiting so long to get our check, we weren't going to sit around for another half hour waiting to get it corrected.  If you go, do yourself a favor and get a real table.  Don't sit in the bar.  Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite go to restaurant!!! Our favorite server is John with the fun mustache!!!! Anyone who wants exceptional service should always ask for him!
As soon as we are sat this amazing server will always bring our favorite drink! Never has to be asked to refill our drinks! Our food always comes out hot, and correct!! Servers like John ensures we will be back! Great job Lazy Dogs!"}
{"text":"Really good. Returning tonight for happy hour. Dominic was awesome! Best waiter around. Had turkey burger. It was slow coming out. GM comped our food. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"We used to eat hear 3 times a week the service is now terrible. We just walked out and went to California pizza kitchen"}
{"text":"It's not always about the food.

First off, the food is average, no gourmet here. It's all about the fat and smell which  makes it taste good.Therefore it's good....uh hah...   the staff is friendly..... as they should be, tips depend on it.
Next the noise, it's off the charts so there is no real possibility of carrying on a normal conservation without raising your voice. Everyone is trying to talk over the next to be heard. Add the music..... well ya get the point. We've been here about 6 times or so. About 8 of our friends have complained and also refuse to go back. We just wanted to see if it would settle down some.
We stopped in 6/28/2015 for \"one and done'' just to get out of the heat 114. Sitting at the bar is usually quieter. A \"dude\" next to us had other ideas. His menu spread out beside his phones to point that it interfered with our service area,  2 phones, not one but 2.... ear buds to make his calls and talking very loud. Ya know the drill ya always talk louder with your ear buds in. To make it worse he aimed his conservation in our direction not towards the service bar next to him. We politely asked him to direct his conservation in the other direction and we were told to F off. Next we called for the MOD to intervene and he was told to basically f-off also. (he always used the F bomb) I instantly thought..... what would happen on an aircraft at 32,000'........ slowly open the door...... and
The manager was totally unequipped to handle the situation. He stood next to us and he himself had to raise his voice to be heard over the \"dude\". .....but did nothing. Most people would take the conversation...... \"or would have been asked by management to take it outside or into the lobby\". That wasn't gonna happen. So we give it only 2 stars because the line staff is good at what they do but not paid to intervene.  The MOD on the other was in over his head and thought the use of a phone at the bar has now become \"acceptable etiquette\" and interfering with a patrons quiet space is now allowable...... wait till we catch him on an aircraft.......

A trip to a restaurant should never end this way.

And no , we will not return and will relay this to anyone who wants our opinion of Lazy Dog including our 8 friends in Summerlin.

Just as we left \"sexual preference\" also became an issue. Lucky for him we believe in the rule of law and not mob rule, in the old days......32,000 would be at ground level."}
{"text":"I must have been on an off day because my experience was bad from start to finish.  First we had to wait because we had six people and the Manager \"Melissa\" must \"approve\" all groups over 5-which the employees all discussed in front of us and I found to be weird and very uncomfortable as did they.  The food took a long time-service was friendly but slow.  Wrong dishes from other tables were waved in front of us.  The chicken pot pie was the worst we have ever had-no veggies that we could see and at the end after discussing our take home order portion, the waitress still got it wrong.  Needless to say it was a long grueling experience with poor but friendly service.  The manager-GM did come by and apologize (then more mistakes were made) and give us a partial credit.  The décor is nice. The Tater Tots are good. The specialty drinks are nice.  Fun place to take a dog. I will re evaluate the next time I visit.  The staff needs to be trained.  The worst part was at the end when my 6 year old had to go to the rest room and went in to a stall to be told to wait (as he was already in it) by a young lady who wanted to put toilet paper in all of the stalls-there was already toilet paper in it and she could have started on another stall.  Obviously she doesn't have kids or she wouldn't tell a 6 year old to wait for such a silly reason when she could have done another stall.  Plain silly and rude.  Lack of common sense."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.  I love the concept being a dog lover and all.  The food was very good and great quality and this means a lot coming from a picky eater like myself.  I started with the peach sangria that was perfectly sweet but not too sweet. They comped me a flatbread since it was my first visit. That was a very nice gesture and it was a perfect texture with light cheese and garlic, very tasty.  For my entree I enjoyed their chicken stir fry with hot and sweet sauce and brown rice.  The flavors were perfect and the cuts of chicken were good quality.  I was perfectly satisfied with my meal, but couldn't pass up dessert, so I went for their house made butter cake. It was nothing short of heavenly and topped off with vanilla ice cream.  In addition, the service was very good and I enjoyed my experience.  I highly recommend this place as it has a great menu selection, very quality food and a dog friendly patio!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our girls lunch here. We ordered the white peach sangria to start. It was crisp and refreshing on a hot day! My friend and I shared the hummus plate and the 3 different hummus were good. We both opted for lighter fare- she had a salad and I tried fish w/black beans and vegetables. Overall a very nice experience and kudos to our waiter for not rushing us when our second pitcher of sangria ran a bit long! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it! Great food, great atmosphere, great music and great dessert! And to top it off we found out we can bring our dog and sit on the patio. They even have a small menu for your fur baby. We will definitely be back...with our fur baby next time. Our Server, Michael, was so awesome and was the one who gave us all the information...which is why we will be back."}
{"text":"I have worked in the Summerlin Area for the last year and have always told myself I would try Lazy Dogs, but didn't get around to it until today with my girlfriend. It was in one word AMAZING!!! David our server was courteous, welcoming, and very knowledgeable. Not only does the whole staff make you feel welcome, but when they found out that we were first time guests, they treated us like royalty!! Shaun the manager brought us their speciality garlic flatbread just to welcome us to the Lazy Dogs family. I will be back time and time again. Their Tortilla soup is also out of this world. 
On to the entrees....
The chicken pesto and hummus salad plate was out of this world!!! The chicken was cooked to perfection and the pesto on top of the chicken was phenom! The mixed greens were very fresh as was the garlic pita served on the side. 
The chicken tenders were hand breaded deliciousness. Tender flakey and flavorful. Their barbecue sauce served on the side was also a nice accommodation. 
My girlfriend had their speciality red beer for her cocktail and it was well balanced and delicious, as was the blonde beer that I had. Definitely will be back again in the near future. Thanks Lazy Dog!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Good food and nice choice of natural health oriented selections.  Great bar, choice of draught beers, wine & mixed drinks.  Roy at the bar is tops!  Friendly bar and efficient service.  Good prices and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Great service and food.    Tortilla Soup was fabulous as was the Pesto Chicken Salad.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Lazy Dogs since it opened and have found it to be a great.  The food and service are always top notch.  The general manager Phil's attention to needs of his customer and employees is far above the norm and he should be considered for promotion at the earliest possible opportunity.  I have also found Brian, Christie, and Lindsey to work hard at making  Dinning At Lazy dogs pleasurable experience.

Looking forward to the new menu.

Sincerely

Joe"}
{"text":"Love bringing my dog here for lunch. I love their salads and lemonades and my four legged baby loves the chicken and brown rice platter!"}
{"text":"The drinks were amazing and the staff was awesome. They would get 5 stars if the manager would free Nemo..."}
{"text":"The manager really went out of his way to keep us happy after the waitress got my order wrong.  Instead of letting me sit there with no food while everyone else in my party was eating their meals the manager asked if I would like a cup of one of their soups or a small salad while I waited for my correct order to be brought out.  So I accepted a cup of the Chicken Tortilla soup.  It was really good.  The dish I had ordered, the Chimichurri Mahi Mahi finally came out and it was really worth the wait!  The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly, the chimichurri was flavorful and the vegetables perfectly complimented the fish.  Excellent!  And they even accommodated our request for a hot drink.  It was really cold out and we wanted a hot drink that wasn't coffee, so when we asked if they could serve their Apple Cider drink warm they did just that.  The manager came by to make sure we were all happy with our food and listened to our suggestion that they offer hot drinks in the winter.  Overall we were very happy with our food and experience and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Service sucks been sitting at a table for more than 20 minutes without a menu or drink. Place is not crowded. More than several wait staff have walked past my table without acknowledgment. Clearly a management issue."}
{"text":"Attended the lunch mock opening. Awesome experience. Sat at the bar with great bartenders. Greeted with smiles and upbeat personalities. Adam and the rest of the team went above and beyond. It was busy but everyone still made us feel welcomed & appreciated. Trainer, Eric (aka \"Vegas\") & the managers expressed appreciation for the support of their opening. The food was amazing. My Baja Shrimp tacos with cilantro black beans, Sweet & Spicy shrimp- all delish. Drinks on point- cucumber mint martini and the Asian pear martini are the bomb. Excellent wine options as well. 
We've been patrons of Lazy Dog in So Cal for years & I'm so happy for their expansion to Nevada. Great location in Summerlin. We will definitely be back to visit and enjoy the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & Dre and T.L. are excellent bartenders!!! Service is spot on & a great place to watch sporting events."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Food was fantastic and loved sitting outside in front of the fire pit. The hostess with the short blond hair was amazing. Super nice and we noticed that she really was a hard worker. Our server, Christina W. (I think that was her name lol Tall short black haired woman) was pretty bad. She's the only reason why this isn't a 5 star review. Took her 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. My boyfriend and I are some what heavy drinkers and I know had she been more attentive, we would have ordered 3-4 more rounds but since she was MIA, guess not. Which was really strange to us because when we would see her, she wasn't busy or running around. She was just kinna strolling around.

But anyways, would definitely come back. Just would like a different server haha"}
{"text":"OK. If you happen to stop by for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday before 2pm, you're going to have access to the special Brunch menu.

Now, if you love pizza and also love breakfast and like me, have often wondered, \"Hey...if they can make a Breakfast Burrito, why can't they invent a Breakfast Pizza?\" Well, they have!

You've gotta pull the trigger on their Sunny Side Up Pizza. Now trust me on this...this bad boy is is a party in your mouth. Three sunny side up eggs on an excellent white-style spinach pizza, with a perfectly done crust to boot. 

I'm going back tomorrow for another one...and I never do that!

My tail's waggin'."}
{"text":"WOW my husband and I are new to Las Vegas. And came to Lazy Dog on a recommendation and absolutely loved it. Jen D. Our waitress was top friendly helpful and we will definitely ask for her when we come back. Thanks Jen D."}
{"text":"Attended a soft opening on Sat. Expected chaos but was pleasantly surprised by staff product knowledge. ALL employees were incredibly friendly. GREAT ENERGY! Food selection was fantastic and delicious! Can't wait to come back with our pup!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.. No ice ..had to ask for refills... No sugar or ketchup on table and couldn't flag down a server because they were too busy.  Wrong salad dressing.. Wrong rice and never asked how our meal was and never offered dessert and no manager in sight.  First and last visit... Go somewhere else as even your dog won't like this place!"}
{"text":"Took my fiancé and two pups here the other night. The service I had was perfect. Not too much. Not too little. Just right. Always perfect portions in the entrees for those looking to not over eat. JD (from Wisconsin) was our waitress and was more than 5 star, any dog owner or general human being should frequent here for 5 star service and 5 star food. You won't regret it. my pups LOVE the chicken"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Great atmosphere and dog friendly!! LOVED the Butter Cake and the Caramelized Brussel Sprouts are a must have! So many great items to choose from in this diverse menu! Best of all, our waiter, Miles, was a rock star! Such wonderful service, friendly, and engaging!! Will definitely dine here again and ask to be seated in Miles' section!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this spot I would say 4 to 5 times over the last 3 months. I like the location, has its own parking lot and the bar is large, but.  It is always something that goes sideways with this place. It's either bad inattentive service or the kitchen is backed up and takes 45 minutes to get a turkey burger. Staff seems pleasant but I never see the same faces so turnover is more than likely pretty high. It just does not have any personality it's too bad, but if you visit here you will know what I' saying right away. So I'm done with Lazy Dog, I feel I gave the restaurant a Legit shot at making it good. But they just don't pay attention enough to know where they are falling short. Or maybe worse they don't care"}
{"text":"We ordered nachos with no chicken, chicken wings and drumsticks. The nachos was not good at all, and the chicken was not fresh and it tasted like they were cooked two days ago, then served to us. I have been here more than a year ago and the food was good at that time. I don't know what had happened from that time until now. I had no choice to give them a star to post this but this time they don't deserve this star. Please change the way you cook the food here."}
{"text":"Great dining experience Adam at the bar is wonderful and their chicken wraps are amazing! They have meals for dogs and a huge dog friendly covered patio. Everything I have had here is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog in Summerlin has a great energy to it, and the staff is always friendly and attentive! Always a great choice on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lazy Dogs in LA and Vegas. Love the menu!!! I actually haven't brought my daughter Precious (Mali-poo) so I have to do that soon! I've had great memories with my Dad here."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Was a long wait for a Friday night for two people but we are able to snag a high top at the bar after a couple minutes ! Can't order a bad dish"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food but it's hit or miss with the waiters and dogs. One waiter will ask if you want water and food for the dog, while another will completely ignore the fact you have a dog and you must ask for water and food."}
{"text":"We were probably one of the most difficult groups to deal with but our waitress Lisa still met our expectations and she was awesome! The manager came to our table to give us a personal introduction to the restaurant which made us feel more comfortable. I had the Cast Iron Idaho Trout and wow it was delicious and potatoes were perfectly cooked. Thank you for the great service and we will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"By far my mother and my most favorite restaurant to go to. They have a wide variety when it comes to their menu. Love their happy hour specials. The wedge salad with the chicken tortilla soup you cannot go wrong I could eat it everyday. Try to make it out there at least once a week sometimes if we're lucky twice. Always great service managers are always on the floor walking around and by far the most amazing dessert called the s'mores campfire brownie it is a must have."}
{"text":"One of the best pot roast I've had! Seasoned well and cooked perfectly. What made the place even better was the service! All thanks to our server Flynn!"}
{"text":"Came all the way here just for the candy bacon. It was delicious. Yanique gave us some excellent selections for the holiday bacon old fashion, and also their mango margarita. Made for a pleasant date night. Highly recommend the BACON CANDY!! (Bet you can't have just one!, no picture because it's gone)"}
{"text":"Laura went above and beyond when it came to the service and overall experience. She was extremely bubbly and was so great with the dogs. We also expressed our our mutual love of horses! Her knowledge with horses was exquisite when it came to breeds and their grooming."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe, great service, and definitely great food. We had the Fried Calamari and Chicken Poblano which were both great. The Calamari is not the everyday \"fried calamari\", its Wok-fried making it juicy and tender, definitely a must try item! 
They also served us garlic flat bread as a welcoming item on the house when we told the waitress it was our first time. I will definitely come back here  after receiving such a great service, and also to try other recommended menu items"}
{"text":"great food and service.  we loved watching football on the patio with our pooches"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Lazy Dog and I was not disappointed. Our server Jessica was very nice and friendly, excellent service. I had the chicken poblano, it was very delicious. There are so many flavors in that dish that makes you want more. The ambiance was spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's convenient, reliable, has a large menu ( so there's always something for everyone) but there's something a little blah about the restaurant. It's like they are trying hard but just don't quite get there. With all of the options available in the surrounding area, it's not our first choice."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place two stars is because of their staff. They actually have some good food and we keep going back because I love their edamame and I want to give them another chance. Like I said we have been there several times and I think there has only been one friendly person. A nice adult lady with blond hair. I say adult because the rest do not act like adults, they are apathetic, rude, and lazy. The hostesses are the worst, they role their eyes if you ask a question and have constant RBF. You're lucky to get a your welcome from the wait staff if you say thank you, if they stop chatting around the terminal to check on you."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we had the best service! Ashley was amazing and the GM, Phil came out to meet us with a free appetizer. The level of service was exceptional. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly! Pricing was great also. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of being able to take your dog to lunch with you....doubt I would, but its a nice option.   I had the turkey burger.  It was good...not a stand out.  I think ill try another option next time.  On the other hand, the peach cobbler for dessert was oh so yummy.  Plenty to share with one or even two more people. The oatmeal topping was a standout.   A nice choice for dining in Summerlin Centre."}
{"text":"The service is horrible and the food is terrible. Cleanliness absolutely horrific, disappointing."}
{"text":"So I came into this restaurant not long ago and it was a fantastic visit, the food was delicious and the server was great. My only problem with this place was that shorter bigger white host. She was unprofessional, very rude, and had bad mannerisms. She kept walking away and having casual conversations with other employees. The other hostess that took us to our table was very nice and attentive and asked us about our day and kept us entertained. I asked what the hostess' in the front name was and she said her name was Shelby or Shelly something like that. This store has a lot of potential it is a shame that this one particular person gave this establishment such a bad impact."}
{"text":"My office is right down the street from this place so I usually come here for lunch a lot and the food and service is usually good at lunch time. Tonight was a different story! The service was SOOOO slow for a night that wasn't that busy. We legit waited 25 mins for someone to come over and ask for our drink order, then another 15!!! minutes for the drinks to come. Our meal was decent, after our meal I expressed to the manager (Raul) that a 40 minute wait for drinks was unacceptable, he pretty much gave me the hope you have a better experience next time! Sorry bud there will be no next time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered the chicken breast sandwich, only after our server, Reagan, assured me that there would be hot carrots or Jalapeños, since I stomach problems. After our dinners were served, Took one bite and couldn't eat as the spicy carrots were still plated. Summoned Reagan over and told her I could eat it, instead of offering to take it back,  she brought me back some \"sauces\" to try. This did not solved the problem, when it cam time for the check, there wasn't even an offer to remove my sandwich. I did not to cause of scene, since we had out of town guests. I do not feel there was any effort to provide a good quality of custmer service. This was not our first time at Lazy Dog, but it will be our last."}
{"text":"First time and had a great meal with great service. I really like their healthier offerings and cocktails made without artificial ingredients or added sugar. Great beer selection, too, with plenty of local breweries featured like Banger, CraftHaus, and Tenaya Creek. Check out their weekend brunch! I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't be called \"Lazy Dog\" more like \"Salty Dog\"!!!! My chicken was the texture of rubber seasoned only with salt. People who actually think this place is good are obviously missing out on what good food really is! Definitely won't be coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Visited this Lazy Dogs on National Beer Day! Service from Ashley was amazing! Lettuce wraps were great too!  We will be back."}
{"text":"DREA DREA DREA!!! 
Best Bartender in Vegas! She is very knowledgeable about the food and drinks that Lazy Dog has to offer. She is also amazing at giving recommendations. 

BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!
Drea is a extremely skilled ninja making sure your glass is always full and that you are taken care of. Some how she always knows when my glass is empty and needs a refill. 

ORGANIZED & CLEAN!
I have never seen any other bartender work so hard at keeping the bar so clean. Drea never stops moving her ninja like hands. If she is not serving the guests or making crazy drinks like some kind of robot, she is organizing and cleaning. I always see her serve a drink immediately followed by cleaning the bar top, wash a rack full of glasses, put in a food order, finished with making countless drinks for the rest of the restaurant.

FIVE STARS!
I not only give Drea 5 stars but the entire Lazy Dog staff and management for creating such an amazing dinning and drinking experience."}
{"text":"Kathe was awesome and gave me all the info on local beer and recommended the hop box and it was amazing! She recommended canon fries and ahi tuna, both amazing,
Brought out dog and it's a pet friendly place! 

Awesome"}
{"text":"After visiting Red Rock Canyon in Vegas we found the Lazy Dog on Yelp. Last year we had tried to eat at one in Dublin,Ca but the wait was too long, now I know why.
I had the chicken pot pie, fantastic and so was 
the service and atmosphere. We don't have a Lazy Dog in San Luis Obispo but until we do will search them out when traveling."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have an unsatisfactory meal. Had the shrimp taco's. If there were 3 shrimp in each that would of been great but they didn't skimp on the cabbage, brown rice was cold and tasteless and black beans dry and cold. My friend was served cold french fries but her ceasar salad and sandwich were good.  We should have complained but we didnt.  I'll try again but won't be ordering the taco's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The food is incredible. It was out first time here and the general manager bought out table an appetizer to welcome us. The customer service is remarkable. The pot roast is to die for. And the prices are very reasonable. Perfect night. Defiantly coming back. Only this time we are bringing our dog, Diezel."}
{"text":"My grandfather, dad and I attended the mock opening and right off the bat I was disappointed at what appeared to be some owner or manager or CEO smoking a cigarette right outside the restaurant. The smell and second hand smoke was discouraging. But we stayed and waited for the doors to open and to be seated. 

Once seated we were created by our waiter/server Andrew. Who turned that sour taste of cigarette smoke into an amazing dinning experience. He made us comfortable and even cracked a few jokes. Can't wait to return . just as long as there's no smokers killing my appetite. 

All in all the whole staff and experience was great and it won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always at Downtown Summerlin so we figured we try Lazy Dog. Looks like a chain restaurant with multiple locations (which it is), but never heard of it previously. 

The interior is warm and approachable, but I couldn't put my finger on its design inspiration. Looks like New Mexico meets Claim Jumper? So curious that I actually looked into it when we were waiting for service. Turns out it's inspired by a lounging dog near a fireplace at a lodge in Grand Teton, WY. Pretty cool and touches home as my husband has fam up there. 

The food is verrry eclectic, reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory in terms of - \"here is a bible of mediocre food offerings bound to interest somebody.\" However, our selections were really tasty! The green chili mac n cheese app was amazing, very flavorful. Ordered a low calorie pasta salad with great citrus under notes. The husband ordered the meatloaf, easily one of the tastiest I've ever had. Good cocktail selection too.

Not on my immediate return list, but I wasn't disappointed. A great place to bring a group of friends or family if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just got done eating lunch outside with my dogs could not eat our food all around our table was a bunch of flies both waiter waitresses and manager witness this and did nothing about it waste of my money today Make sure your dogs have their shots"}
{"text":"We love Lazy Dog as a great place to enjoy our friends with our favorite animals.  We brought our hiker kitten, Cali, today along with 2dogs of friends.  Great time!!  Too bad they won't allow Cali to return.  She is incredibly well-behaved but apparently other felines in CA were not so no cats allowed now.  Cali is for sure a chill kitten and VEGAS is way more chill than CA.  Perhaps a Cali exception should be made!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming when they had a huge party and was never quite sure who my waiter was. The atmosphere was nice and the food good too. I came here for happy hour but I guess they don't have it on weekends. Hopefully next time it's a better experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing, from start to finish! The menu has a lot of variety, which keeps you wanting to come back to try more items! We started with the Verde Nachos and Corn Wheels, which both I highly recommend! The Pulled Pork Sandwich and Ahi Tuna Burger were exceptional, as well. As far as cocktails, the Raspberry Moscato Sangria pitcher was refreshing and delicious.

Besides the menu, our experience was truly made by our server, Karen, who brought personality and care to the table. She explained the menu extensively, and even got us a complimentary flatbread, as it was our first time visiting. I can't tell you how many times we've dined on the Strip, and have been highly disappointed by the service we received. The service at Lazy Dog solidifies why we choose to always eat local (off the Strip). Karen made our experience memorable, and we look forward to returning and seeing her again!"}
{"text":"Gave it a second try but was even worse. Dogs barking loud all through dinner and multiple guests were annoyed, but no one from restaurant did anything about it. Some other tables food kept being brought to our table so the waitress didn't know where she was going. Ordered the ribs and they were super fatty. One of them even had no meat on it. Won't go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill out watch some sports, drink some good beer's and eat great food. My buddy and I came in the other night  and sat in the bar (self seating) James was our sever and had great knowledge of beers.We ended up getting a house stout and a coffee kolsh. Also totally changed my mind about brussel sprouts!!! They are a must try!!!  He also suggested the blue burger that was amazing as well. All and all great food,beers and service."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Downtown Summerlin across the street from Red Rock Casino pool side! Very laid back friendly restaurant with excellent food, bar and outdoor patio for patrons with their dogs! Randy was our server & was terrific with everything! Black & Bleu pizza was awesome & tater tots app was sweet potato with a kick! Yummy! Desserts looked gr8, but too full so will be back soon! Loved this restaurant in SoCal & wonderful addition in Summerlin for families!"}
{"text":"Went to check out this spot with some friends. I ordered a black and bleu burger, and cajun fries. Definitely was one of the best burgers ive had. Customer service was excellent, I really like how as soon as you walk in the place you are immediately greeted by wonderful hosts. I really appreciate the service that was provided by a hostess by the name of Amari. Very nice, enthusiastic, and cute . Overall I had a great experience at Lazy Dog."}
{"text":"Hands down WORST service I've ever experienced. I couldn't even tell you our servers name because she never bothered to tell us. Took 10 mins to get greeted once we were sat. Took another 10 mins to get drinks on the table. Our food took about 45 mins on top of that and the order was wrong, but by that point our server was nowhere to be found. Finally I just asked for a manager. Thankfully Jason knew how to take care of a table properly. The one star goes to him for his attempted recovery. I had explained to him it was my friends birthday and our terrible service was putting a damper on the day. He took care of my friends food & took the liberty of ordering our dessert. I thought for sure the worst had past, but our wonderful server kept the shit show going. She brought out my friends birthday dessert, candle in hand, she put the candle on top of the dessert and walked away without lighting it. Thankfully I had a lighter, but at that point I was at a loss for words. I will not be returning to Lazy Dog nor will I ever recommend friends/ family. This wasn't the first time I've had bad service there, but it's one I'll never forget."}
{"text":"Can I just say, Drea is pure sunshine and she's contagious.  No matter how my day has been, the moment we roll in to LD, she takes it up a notch. And it's not just her adorable personality, this chick is a fierce cocktail samurai who maintains an immaculate bar. Any day, any time, if she's there, it's on."}
{"text":"Awesome food and people. The patio is very nice and  will defiantly come back. It's not expensive either."}
{"text":"Bland food.... I wanted to like it!! The bar setup is nice .... Angels game is on (worth one star by itself) but the bland food doesn't do it for me .... Red sauce on a fish taco ?? Serving sizes were good and the staff is nice but a little green."}
{"text":"Our server was super nice and very accommodating. My puppy had a great time and enjoyed his meal of chicken and rice. The dog portion was pretty big so I asked them to half it and I took the other half home with me and had it for my dinner! The food for us was really tasty too. The only downside is that the dogs aren't allowed inside which I thought was a little odd, I thought the whole point of the restaurant was to bring your dog along. But we sat outside and had a great time! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love coming here during their happy hour for great prices on food and drinks. Whenever I visit mekha at the bar she always helps me decide on what new items to try and what cocktails I should get based off of certain flavors I enjoy. The kimchi fried rice is my obsession, it is definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"WOW incredible food fantastic bartenders thay are to die for great service.If you should come hear try the ahi poke and to drink James & Ginger."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they loooove dogs! My go to place when poochy comes out with us!"}
{"text":"Have gone here a few times and wanted to wait to post a review. The menu does not stand out with any entrees or appetizers that would make you rush back. The staff is friendly and helpful. Only reason I would visit again is if we have a large party and there is no wait time."}
{"text":"Haven't been disappointed, yet! We have gone to Lazy Dog at lest once a week since they have opened. We've had the best experience every time - from service, to food  and ambiance. The bar area is perfect for watching games and the patio is perfect for open air dining...but be warned - MUST LOVE DOGS - because there can be a lot of them in all shapes and sizes. We haven't seen any dogs misbehave or worse (insert emoji - you know which one I mean)...it's been a really pleasant experience.

Recommendations: hummus platter, calamari, vegetarian lasagna (incredible!), fries with the lemon aioli sauce, veggie burger, fish tacos and ahi. We don't eat meat so it's great to have so many options on the menu.

So many things left to try! We'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Kathee is the best(: The boy and I come here all the time, and it is quickly becoming one of our favorite restaurants. And there are cute little doggies allowed in here!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my wife and my pug for a late dinner as a continuation of my pooch's 2nd Birthday meal of the day. We came around 7:30 or so and were promptly seated. Initially we were seated by our hostess at a small table for two, but asked our waiter if we could move to a larger table where it would be more comfortable for us since the patio area (which is for patrons who are dining with dogs) was mostly empty. The waiter happily obliged us. 
I've eaten at Lazy Dog's before with friends, but this was the first time I've been here since I became a dog owner and thus it was my first time dining in the patio area. Overall the patio area was nice. There were other patrons with their dogs, there was plenty of seating, several tv's, and a fire pit in the center. 
Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. He took our orders for the pot roast and fish tacos. We also ordered a hamburger patty w/ brown rice for our pooch. He even asked us if we wanted all the dishes to come out at the same time, to which we said yes. Our dishes came out after about 10-15 minutes. I enjoyed the pot roast along with its gravy and the mashed potatoes and spinach that it came with. I just wish there was a little bit more of the pot roast because I was really hungry. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos and the Spanish rice it came with. My dog on the other hand, didn't really touch his food, but that's mainly because my pug is very finicky and it was served in a plate that was unfamiliar to him. That and he probably didn't like brown rice it came with (though he has no issue at all with white rice). Once we got home, he had no problem with the hamburger patty and ate it with zest. 

Overall, we enjoyed our first meal with our pug at Lazy Dog's and would like to return."}
{"text":"As many reviews mentioned, the atmosphere is great. The layout is nice, it is a huge restaurant, very clean and feels welcoming. The outside patio is pretty cool as well.

We went here for a birthday dinner a week ago and our experience was fantastic. The food was great and great in variety, the beer selection good, we had a good time. We had the hummus trio (The green hummus is awesome) The Cajun fries (OMG DELICIOUS! The portions are huge and so filling and so worth it!) We got the Black & Bleu Pizza and honestly it was one of the best I have had. Order it asap.

My reason for the lower rating is because we went again last night to try out their happy hour and were a little bit disappointed. This time we sat at the bar and again got Cajun fries (had to) and ordered the edamame (Amazing. The sauce is so good.) and the pear martini was delicious. The downside was being ignored almost blatantly. There was not many people sitting there at all and we were patient and excited to be there again and it was just poor service the entire time.

UPDATE:
We have been here several times and the disappointment mentioned above occurred on 3 different occasions where we noticed poor customer service and attitude in general. After speaking with the manager, every time we have been back we have had zero issue. We have gone back with different friends and everyone loves the place. I appreciate a place that recognizes a mistake and then works hard at it. Kudos! Also Olivia is the name of our wonderful waitress the first time and we got to see her again recently and told her how amazing she is. If you are in her section then you are lucky! She's fantastic."}
{"text":"Great environment to dine in. Love the service and the fact you can bring your dog.  Love ordering the Ahi Tuna, this dish is excellent and is highly recommended. The butter cake is probably one of the best desserts out there. Great Summerlin location, try"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is a great place to hang out with your family and dog.  The patio is great and has a nice fire pit for fall and winter.  The food is good and there is a lot to choose from.   We love that there is a dog menu and we order that first. Then the hummus to start with one of their hand crafted lemon aids.  Oh, the root beer float is to die for!  My husband always orders something different, but I have to have the lemon caper chicken pasta. Only 525 calories, light, filling and yummy!   People are friendly and service is good. At times, it can be alittle slow, but we just relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in for a shot and a beer after work. Drea at the bar is super sweet. Great atmosphere. Haven't eaten here yet but the menu looks good!"}
{"text":"Our server Kaleigh was amazing. She was so attentive and helpful. We really loved the edamame. Definitely will be back to visit Kaleigh."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now!!  The food is always good.  We try to get our favorite server Fin (Amber). We love her always attentive and friendly!  We will be back!!! We have tried servers things on the menu and all have been good!"}
{"text":"Good was so good but service was so slow. When I finally was done waiting for a check I went to the front to talk to a manager. Big mistake The manager was so rude (our waitress was nice just slow) it ended badly and now I won't go back"}
{"text":"i went here with a group of coworkers.  this place is loud and the food is okay.  not what i was expecting and not into dogs at restaurants"}
{"text":"Normally when I order takeout everything is good , but today I ordered some salads, load potatoes and fries.....
Everything was good except fries that looks like cold , and reheated . Lazy Dog fries was one of my favorite fries in town , but after today ...."}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas, came here and it was wonderful! Service was swift and food was great and well-priced for the amount that you got. I recommend getting the iced mocha with your meal. Portions are pretty big so a great place to come if you're starving. Our server was Gerardo and he was  very kind!! Would come here again if I'm ever in this neck of the woods sometime soon."}
{"text":"Very poor service, Our second time going we thought maybe the first we went was a Friday night it was a little busy. So we thought going in on a Tuesday night would be a different experience. But no we had POOR service took a about 10 to 15 mins before a server came to us. It wasnt busy for any servers not to attend us promptly. Waiters did not once check on us had to get up off our seats to look for a waiter to get condiments  and to even ask for a refill of water.. We as well had to get up to look for the waiter for our check.. Food wasn't too great as well !!!! Dont really recommend this place at all !!!"}
{"text":"If your passing through and visiting Las Vegas you have to try the lazy dog. The bar staff  was very friendly and attentive. The manager came by and greeted us and made us feel welcome there. Their layout is clean and they have ample bar space."}
{"text":"Our family of 3 went for lunch today.  I thought it was okay; nothing great.  The food was of high quality, but portions relatively small.  Not much bang for your buck.  I had the lunch fish and chips (substituted spinach) for the fries.  The fish was delicious, the coleslaw okay and the spinach fresh.  Hubby had the chicken wok.  He wasn't in love, but he ate the relatively small portion.  Son had the pot roast sandwich and ordered a side Caesar Salad.  One ice tea and the total, not including tip, was $45.00+.  Our sever was pleasant, but needed to be reminded to bring certain items.   Noisy place.   The rest of the family doesn't plan on coming back.  I will give it one more shot because many of the menu items look interesting."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Ashley out server was great. Had a slight issue with my dinner but was promptly corrected by her. Explained menu to our relatives, who were first timers. Food was great. New items were tasty."}
{"text":"This was the first time with the wife here. Food was good with big portions and Dominic was great along with the rest of the staff. The nitro stout was great! Come on in and ask for Dom, that is what I am doing every time I come to Lazy Dogs."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our first experience at this restaurant. I worked in the restaurant business for years and know things can get crazy BUT we were extremely disappointed with the outcome. When we placed our order for our entrees they came out in a timely manner for 3/7 people in our party. When the pizza came out, we asked for no onions and we were told the pizza with out onions went to the wrong table so we waited. Then my moms food still hadn't come out as well as our friend who ordered a hamburger. After about 20 min and no manager stopping by we waited and waited. The pizza came out and then my moms food finally right. We also waited on some other food for my friends child they just forgot. The biggest complaint I have is that our friend waited 35 minutes for his burger to come out and yes I timed it. We were all finished eating by the time he got it. Clearly there is something wrong in my opinion when you wait that long for a meal your paying at a nice restaurant for and you get no response from a manager until your done eating. It completely ruined our experience there and when we were handed a 10 dollar gift card we then even more realized we won't be back to this restaurant in the future. The only reason I'm giving this this two stars is because our waiter was so nice and felt really bad but action should have been taken from the very beginning."}
{"text":"Such great food and service. Tony was an excellent server and manager, noticed him helping everywhere making things flow. The food is great with a wide variety. Lazy dog beers are their house craft beer....so good. We left the strip twice to eat here on our vacation."}
{"text":"Happy hour is an especially good deal at his place. You can have that while sitting on the patio or in the bar, sitting on the patio can be a fun time they do have dogs out there though so keep that in mind. They got rid of the spinach dip recently and replaced it with some other dip, not my style. The mini pizzas are great."}
{"text":"Normally a great restaurant. Today however we got a hostess by the name of Santana. She initially treated my wife rudely, raising her voice at my wife because she didn't understand our last name. We were with out of town guests and didn't want an issue. It was clear to Santana we weren't happy with her attitude.  We were then conveniently forgot about while waiting for a table. I complained about the wait, she said our table was being prepared and it would be about 2 minutes. Approximately 15 minutes later I told Santana I wanted to speak  with a manager. We were immediately seated. My son handed Santana the pager, she aggressively pulled the pager out of his hands. The manager, Eric,  was very good about our situation and we were comfortably reimbursed for the issues. Upon ordering our food, one of our of town visitors had ordered a half of a turkey sandwich. She removed the top of the sandwich and right there in the middle was a bug. She lost her appetite and the server took the sandwich to Eric. Eric returned to our table and apologized profusely, agreeing there was a bug in the sandwich. We were again properly reimbursed, Eric was great, managed his customers as he should. However the question remains if you piss Santana or another hostess or host off is your food compromised. Some make ask, \"Was this a coincidence\"? I personally don't believe in coincidences. Good job Eric, Santana has to go."}
{"text":"The French toast with strawberries is the best French toast I've ever had in my life. 
I also had the biscuit breakfast sandwich which was incredible. The biscuit was crispy but soft on the inside and the proportion of bacon egg and cheese was perfect. Honestly some of the best brunch food I've had in Vegas. Will definitely be returning. I also think having a patio to bring dogs is great!"}
{"text":"Great location, awesome service, very dog friendly, WiFi, relaxing, very inviting, managers always around checking to make sure things are good. If anyone's looking for me this is where you kind find me."}
{"text":"We had been to the Lazy Dog in Huntington Beach so we had high expectations for this location - Didn't happen.

We saw our server once - when he took our order - He was clueless on gluten free options - When he was asked about one of the meals being gluten free his response was \"I don't know\" - Not \"let me find out.\"

The food was cold when it came and the only other time we saw any other server was when one sped by our table and dropped the check off without breaking stride.  Not even a water refill. 

This was the first time in my life that I have not left a tip - Our usual tip is at least 25% of our bill - Again based off the other reviews my hope for this place is we caught it on a \"bad night.\" 

Las Vegas has lots of dining options - We won't be going to the Las Vegas Lazy dog again, we will save that visit for Huntington Beach."}
{"text":"A bunch of really interesting food options. Good drinks and a huge menu. On a super slow night, the service is good. However, when it is busy, the service is always awful and insanely slow. I don't blame the servers because they are always nice and apologetic. Seems more like a staffing issue, management."}
{"text":"Best meal my wife and I have ever had in Vegas.   The hummus appetizer set the stage - 3 different flavors with a special pita bread and veggies.   We then ordered 4 different entries and ate family style.   If you don't normally order like this, ask the waiter to set this up.    We are so glad we did.   Having Asian chicken and carne asada is the way to go.     Save room for dessert because the brownie was decadent!     This place would be amazing with the food alone, but the staff made it even better.   They knew when to provide assistance at the right moment and not interrupt our conversation.    We will be eating here every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We come here often and it's always so good! We came in for brunch this morning and got the french toast and a breakfast burger. The food was delicious but our server was even more AMAZING. Ashley chatted us up and was so sweet the entire time we were there. I hope we can see her next time we come!"}
{"text":"We decided on Lazy Dog for lunch after hearing positive feedback from my brother.  He'd mentioned that they had a patio where patrons could bring their dogs to eat with them, and as an avid dog lover, I was immediately intrigued.

The restaurant sits in the far northwest section of Downtown Summerlin.  It's a stand alone building, so it's pretty easy to find.  We were greeted by very friendly staff and were seated right away.  The waiter showed up promptly, offered suggestions from the menu, took our drink order and returned with our beverages very quickly. He was friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and professional. 

The menu is robust without being overwhelming.  There are interesting appetizers, salads and entrees for just about every appetite.  I decided on the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad.  The food came out in under 15 minutes.  My salad was fresh, filling and had just the right amount of kick.  Kudos for mixing the chicken throughout the salad, rather than piling it all on top.  And some extra recognition to our server for excellent service.  Jack was literally taking the last sip from his drink when the waiter showed up with a refill.  Awesome!

With the cool paw print decor everywhere, excellent service, and some pretty tasty food, Lazy Dog will certainly become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"This place is great to bring your well behaved furry family. Prices are reasonable and staff is very nice.food is excellent"}
{"text":"If you want a cold drink and some good food in Summerlin, you can't go wrong at Lazy Dog.  We like to sit on the patio with the dogs and take in the fresh air. Nice variety on the menu from bar food to dinner entrees.  Reasonable price and nice assortment of beers."}
{"text":"We had a Great experience at Lazy Dog!
We ordered the Wok fried Calamari, it was the best we have ever had!!! Very happy with all the food and drinks. 
Our waitress Colleen was WONDERFUL! She helped us with the menu and was very attentive.
We will definitely make Lazy Dog our go to restaurant. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great management team....good prices and very well designed it has a robust and loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time eating at Lazy Dog in Summerlin. I had the Rainbow Trout and my Granddaughter the Chicken BBQ crisp. The food was amazing and our server Ashley took such good care of us."}
{"text":"Horrible. We were sat within the 15-20 minute wait time they quoted, outside with our pup and there was a dirty bowl of water and dirty bowl of rice on the ground under our table still not picked up. Fine. We ordered our drinks and food as well as new clean water for the dog with our waitress.  first up was our soup. It was very bland, and I had to add a generous amount of hot sauce to flavor it. At this point we didn't have silverware or napkins, only the soup spoon that had come with the soup which was a bit messy because of all the melted cheese. The water for the pup still wasn't out yet so I asked the food runner to please get us some. We sat and chatted for a while after we were done with our soups and before our main dish came.  When the main dishes came we still didn't have silverware or napkins. My friend had to ask for them, and when they came they were filthy. My first bite into the pot roast was cold! The gravy was dried up and you could tell just by the sight of it that it had been sitting out quite a while.  I let the waitress know it was cold, but it seemed like we always had to get her attention because she didn't even bother to check on us.  I didn't like the pot roast at all, it was cold to begin with. The second time around the gravy was not a solid, so I could see that it was at least warm but so so dry. I could barely eat it. We tried to quickly get over the horrible entree and order dessert which was not so bad, but the spoons were soooo dirty- like food gunk crusted on it dirty. After we finished we wanted to get the hell out of there because it seemed like we were there forever and we were- Almost two hours. We waited for her to come back to check on us, clear the table, and drop our check but she wasn't around. I stood up and just remained standing until she saw I needed the check asap so we could leave. She finally noticed me, and gave me the \"I'll be right with you.\"  It was probably 5 minutes after that, that our check was dropped.  I wanted to use a credit card but I knew that would have taken years to accomplish with this service so I paid cash. I won't be returning to this place, the food was not good, and the service was awful!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life ???!!  Great food , huge menu, great service and best of all your four legged friend is allowed on the patio. They even have a special menu for your doggie.  Hope they can open one in Henderson .   I will drive across town until then. The food is so worth it"}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times and have loved it each time! The food is wonderful. I have not had anything but great here. Our server reccomended the calamari and told us it was different - didn't sound good but we tried it! I will never eat calamari again since this was fabulous! I LOVE the scratch kitchen everything is so fresh! The POT PIE is amazing and has the perfect amount of sauce, where it was not over powering leaving out ingredients. I love the Pasta and the chicken wraps!  The price was the best part. They are not trying to make anyone go broke here - they are very reasonable which allowed us to order drinks and dessert freely. Loved the dessert menu that changes through the seasons! This restaurant is a KEEPER!"}
{"text":"Jackie was amazing, she was very attentive, nice and gave great suggestions since it was my first time there . The food and service were both excellent. Everyone should come to this location"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Monday's 3pm to Close Happy Hour.  A nice assortment of tasty bar food treats.  The coconut monitor is DELISH.  The icing on the cake was the service we received from Carol.  She was AMAZING!  

For a great happy hour and AMAZING service head to the bar and ask to be sat in Carol's section."}
{"text":"I heard the best history of how the restaurant got this name from my waitress Sarah  Her eyes were shining as she tell us the story with so much love and enthusiasm. Then the food came and now we are full waiting for o promo Cajun"}
{"text":"Our waiter Miles, was the best. He was honest about his recommendations on the menu. He made it easy to decide what to choose. The food was good and it was brought out with a smile. Happy we picked Lazy Dog and look forward to another meal here. Thank you Miles for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's Day, sat at the bar.  John, our server, was super friendly and was like the Energizer Bunny!  Food was good as was the craft beer.  It was busy (of course) but food came out hot and done just right.  A totally positive visit."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have gone to Lazy Dog three times. Two out of the three times we have had to speak with the manager because of the non-existent service. Tonight we decided to go there with friends before we left for a road trip with our dog. Super convenient to be able to bring your dog, albeit a little hot. First thing we did was ask for some ice water for four. The person who seated us said she was only a hostess and couldn't get us water. We waited another few minutes and our server came out. We asked for water as soon as possible, and some for our dog. It was about 105 degrees out, cooling off but not fast enough. After waiting for 12 minutes (I checked my phone as I texted our friends when we arrived), we still had no water and we decided to leave. When we got up and started to walk out our server finally came out, so we asked to speak with the manager. After waiting again in the heat for a few more minutes we walked inside and approached the host desk. The manager was standing there and hadn't been told to come see us. We made our complaint and she offered to get our drink orders. We told her we hadn't even ordered drinks, just some water because of the insane heat. She then repeated her offer to get us drink orders as if she hadn't heard us. As locals with continued bad service here I can't say when I'll be ready to return..."}
{"text":"We were outside on saturday afternoon for there brunch time, it was me and couple of friends we all had a round of drinks and ordered some appetizers,wok fired calamari and the brussel sprouts thanks to our servers recommendations. I think his name was Omar he was outgoing and welcoming which made our experience even better we all had a blast were local so had a lot to relate to, he offered some great house brews. Everyone was attentive and looks like they like working here and having fun we finally got our orders in for some brunch items,2 country chicken and biscuits , and a sunny side up pizza our server , said his favorite was the chicken and biscuits, every thing he told us was on point so we decided to get what he recommended so we did  and now i know why, it was out of this world it was a great experience we will all definitely be back.
Awesome service , Awesome food,Awesome atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to come either with a small or even a large group. 

The bar is AMAZING. Andrea (Dr. Dre) and TL are the staple duo at the bar and are both outstanding! They're both the lost professional, kind and attentive women I've ever encountered!

EVERY time I come here Dre or TL are sure to say hello and make it a great experience! They are he reason I come back so often!

Come for the great happy hour and appetizers! Lots of variety in the menu! 

My personal favorites are the Hummus Trio and the Spinach Chicken Feta salad. 

Love this place and love the staff!!"}
{"text":"My family and I are in town for just two nights, and didn't really have any ideas about where to go. I chose this place mainly because it's close to where we were staying.

Totally worth a longer drive. I thought it was gonna be like a basic Red Robin kind of thing, but the food and service was just super all-around amazing.

We ordered two minutes before happy hour ended, and our server (Ronnie) was a freakin champ about helping us slide in with our orders before it ended. I was way impressed with her the whole night.

BBQ Bison Meatloaf was pretty much the best meatloaf I've ever had. The beer selection was great. We had these roasted carrots for an appetizer, no idea how they made carrots taste so good. Just...way to go. 

So, thank you Ronnie! Thank you Kristin for hiring good people and keeping a good floor of a restaurant. (she was the manager we chatted with for a bit.) Definitely want to spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service... takes over 15-20 for minutes for a server to even approach a table of bartender to come by if you're at the bar...Guess I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"So good!! Everyone is super friendly and I love that it caters to dogs  the hummus trio is delicious"}
{"text":"Dinner + Drinks + DOGS?!! This place is a no brainer for any animal lover! And when I don't have my old dog with me I sit at the bar with Drea. She's cuter than a puppy PLUS she knows how to make the perfect dirty martini."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble upon this place since it was close to the red rock canyon and decided to go in and I'm so glad we did. Their food is delicious and the butter cake is to die for. Our server Lisa was so amazing thank you to her for recommending we try the dessert because YUMMMMM!! If we're back in the area we will be coming back to lazy dog"}
{"text":"Just had the best experience at lazy dog with or server Finn she was so nice and attentive. This was my first time here and I will definitely be coming back the food was amazing from start to finish."}
{"text":"Have visited the restaurant twice in the last 10 days. The food and service was outstanding on each visit.  My guests from overseas were equally delighted as was a friend from the other side of town.  Didn't know about the dog-friendly aspect the Sunday brunch visit.  Utterly marvellous and the doggies a delight (even a doggie menu).  Well done, Lazy Dog, well done!!  I will be back... many times."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good, nothing overly outstanding or overly terrible making it less memorable than other places, but this restaurant has a revolving door of new faces. The busier this place gets, the lower the quality of food is I've noticed. It is a popular spot though because the food here is shockingly cheap compared to a lot of other restaurants and they have a wonderful beer selection but I have a major beef with this place, hence the reason it only gets 3 stars. 

The dishes they do well, they do great at. But the problem is that their menu is constantly changing so instead of getting better at their dishes, they would rather put out mediocre seasonal items, and constantly change their menu instead of getting better at what they are great at and giving their menu a little stability. For example, they had some the most amazing chicken tenders and fries basket. I'm talking some of the best chicken strips on the planet but they pulled them from their menu and replaced them with these mediocre buffalo chicken pops. Why do that? Why not just keep making what people love instead of making them feel forced to try something new? I get having seasonal items is important but not when the quality of food suffers. That said, they do have a lot of wonderful regular food items to choose from but they have no problem taking it off the menu with little or no notice to try something different that may or may not work out."}
{"text":"we were there for new years eve had a wonderful dinner and drinks with friends, I had to send my meal back to get it warmed up waitress said no problem a few minutes later Mgr came back with a New plate not the one I had this was so nice and to top it off he took it off our bill I was amazed and suprised and want to say it was much appreciated We will b back  and thank you again"}
{"text":"Great food great staff great beer selection! This restaurant concept does everything right!!"}
{"text":"Great good food,staff was helpful and friendly. Handcrafted beer was a plus. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is average at this location. The quality of food at the Summerlin location is much better. But I won't return because the service on the patio is terrible. We we ignored for long periods of time and had to flag down other employees for assistance. I just couldn't wait to leave. I felt very uncomfortable there."}
{"text":"Went there with my family.  The service was outstanding.  Jenny was our server.  Very attentive and very warm personality.  The pace of the meal was spot on and they are very up front about if you don't care for anything or want anything special they can accommodate.  
We had the calamari..not your typical battered calamari and had a sweet and tangy sauce on it.  Different but I did enjoy it. For the entrée I had the warm chicken on focaccia bread..loved it!  I tried some of my wifes pasta and fathers Chicken Parmesan.  If I had any gripe was that the food was a tad on the bland side.  Nothing a little seasoning couldn't fix.
Overall it had a good vibe and a solid crowd.  Would love to sit on the psyio next time with my pooches."}
{"text":"Arizona is amazing!!!!! The mango margarita was delicious. My mom was here on vacation and loved this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The whole family enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The chicken pot pie, burgers, black and blue pizza, and chicken parmigiana were all great. Service was prompt/friendly. The 22oz Pale Ales were cold and smooth. We will return here frequently!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog Restaurant... great name for a restaurant.. I think that they hired the staff that follows suit because they are LAZY!! When we were here for lunch the host said to sit where u want and took forever to get menus  to even see what we wanted ... the waitress was horrible...when our food arrived she was MIA.. we had to go get our own condiments and had to finally flag her down for another beer.... she was too busy bullshitting with the bartender.. the rest of the waitstaff were too busy sing along with the music The was being piped thru the intercom... food was actually good.. will Seriously consider coming back here again"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 2 1/2 if it was a option. They were super friendly and the atmosphere was inviting then things went very wrong... Orders came out 20 minutes apart took 20 minutes to receive another round of beers manager came over and apologized but in the most unapologetic way. I could go on and on about reasons why I'll never go there again and it's sad because the place is nice, the beer is good and the food is mediocre at best. I will never go to this establishment again..."}
{"text":"The beer sampler is the place to start, great beers!  We had the Asian Calimari which was different and really good.  The wife had the Ahi Tuna and I had the chicken pot pie, both of which was great.  It was really busy, but our waiter Adam (I think that was his name) took good care of us.  He kind of reminded me of Tito Ortiz a bit.  It is a bar and grill and we went on a Saturday night so it was pretty loud which is to be expected.  We look forward to going there again and trying more stuff.  The menu is very diverse, so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Loved the Tex mex salad, the carmelized Brussels sprouts, the squash and bacon pizza!!! Great service too!!! Alejandro was super attentive and had a wonderful personality!!!"}
{"text":"So sad, worst dining experience ever! I have been a 
loyal customer but will never return. Our server, Amy, was the rudest and most cocky server we have ever encountered. When my husband approached the manager, I believe his name is Ken, he stated that \"would make it right the next time we  came in.\" Now to the food...it was okay, but not hot and it didn't taste fresh. 
I loved to patronize this restaurant but cannot any longer."}
{"text":"Great service!

A nice atmosphere and happy hour is good.

Will definitely be back with the friends!

Glad to see so many east coast people in one place!

Thanks Mike and Joey!!"}
{"text":"Great service .....many friendly  faces......love the trio humus. .and the best part is pet friendly. ..for SURE I'm going back . Fun drink menu..fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with the food here.  The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. I have come here for lunch and dinner a few times.  By far the brunch seems to be the hottest time. Sitting on the patio is a must, but if you don't like a plane flying over every couple of minutes you should probably sit inside.  The huckleberry pancake is so delicious and the breakfast pizza.  Bloody Mary and peach Bellini to pair on the brunch is outstanding. Customer service can be iffy here by just depends who you get."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant ever! Service was lousy the pizza and steak we ordered were cold and over cooked. The server was nice and she put in a new order for us... Manager was nice he came over and didn't charge us for the 2plates... But overall service was not great... Lazy dog in California is way better. Of course they have great reviews people in Las Vegas don't know any better 
Will not be coming back here. I do thank manager he tried his best to make up for the food being cold and over cooked, After living in Vegas for just 5months I've realized this City Sucks people cannot cook and they have no work ethics. All Vegas really is an Illusion 
Thank God we're going back to Cali"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Great spot to meet up with family or friends. Many outstanding menu items to satisfy any type of cravings. Great service with a lively atmosphere. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dogs has really good food.  They add new dishes often, sometimes they take something I love off the menu, but overall the food is great.  I do takeout a lot, and you have to watch to make sure they put everything in the bag and that you're not missing anything you ordered, that would be my only complaint.  The loaded potato patties and the sweet potato tots are my fav!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible.  Went there for the first time maybe a couple months ago for a birthday party.  We had reservations for a large group, it took a 1/2 hour past our reservation to get a table and then they gave use a table with not enough seats so we had to move our own tables.  Took another 1/2 hour to get a menu, 45 minutes to order drinks which I had to ask for again after my food was served to get.  Was there an 1 1/2 hours before getting the food which was okay but not worth returning for considering the terrible service.

Maybe its okay during the off hours but it is not worth it to me to return."}
{"text":"Woof Woof! Man's best friend can now go on a date with you.

No matter where I am, I love to try new places even if they've been there for a while. Luckily, this place just opened in Downtown Summerlin. 

Met my human friends here for a get together dinner. Like all Yelpers, I turned to Yelp to provide me with the important details of a place. After looking over all the essential pieces for planning a dinner, I screenshot the location with address to them. 

We showed up without a reservation but the wait wasn't too long. We were seated inside near the fireplace. Talk about warm and cozy with your friends. Our server Laura was awesome! We were all about a few under by this time of night and very glad to have a server who could roll with our humor and craziness. Since it was everyone's first time eating at Lazy Dog, we were very dependent on her suggestions. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu and would come back to take our beverage order. 

The guys ordered the Lazy Dog House sampler. The best way to try their house brews without going under the table before dinner. I had the Rum Barrel Punch and my girlfriend ordered the Snow Cap. The guys were satisfied with the sampler. They really liked the Blonde Ale. I liked my rum punch and after tasting the Snow Cap, I think I would order that next time. It's very similar to drinking iced coffee with Kahlua. 

Laura was back and ready to take our order. Sorry, we will still need more time...but we will order some small plates to start. We placed an order of the Hush Puppies,  Caramelized Brussels Sprouts and Cajun Fries. The first two selections were Laura's suggestions. The Hush Puppies was basically a bite size baked potato. So good but be sure to cut it in half before eating. The insides were very (temperature) hot. If you are not a big fan of Brussels Sprouts then you might want to try it at Lazy Dog. You can hardly taste the Brussel sprout flavor. It is completely overpowered by the lemon, garlic, butter and capers. I love Brussel sprouts so it was too flavorful for me but it was a new way to try it. 

We finally ordered our entrees...items that were ordered includes the slow-braised lamb shank, the bone-in pork schnitzel, and the chicken poblano. It seemed like our food came out in lightning speed. Talk about fall off the bone braised lamb shank. It was so juicy with the sauce and the mashed potatoes complimented it very well. If you have tried a schnitzel from Switzerland then you might want to visit the Lazy Dog. Their schnitzel isn't exactly like Switzerland's but it's darn close. Don't forget to squeeze the lemon to bring out a new flavor. The only part of the chicken poblano that I tried was the crispy corn cake that topped off the dish. Those little cakes are packed with a spicy kick. 

Sweet & sinful ending to a wonderful dinner meant ordering the Butter Cake. This delectable dessert could make a man who normally doesn't eat dessert take a bite. The cake that is the foundation of the dessert is baked to perfection. This filling cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best ice cream flavor ever! The strawberry compote is absolutely lovely and I wish they would pack it in a little mason jar and sell it. 

It was a great night with friends at the Lazy Dog. Thank you Laura for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"My third time here. The first two times, were amazing (food, service, etc.). Tonight, not so much. 

We got there about 7:45 and sat in the bar area to watch the game. About 20 minutes later, nobody had so much as said hello. I finally went and told the hostess. A few minutes later(after I watched the hostess talk to him) a charismatic guy came over and acted like he just happened to notice that we hadn't been helped (my hero...) 

Anyway, we ordered our drinks and food which were good and came out pretty quickly, but I had to wait an eternity to ask our dude for some BBQ sauce (which I needed btw due to the Lazy Dog using French's ketchup for some god forsaken reason-they're a mustard company, not a ketchup one,there is a difference-get Heinz) at which point, he suggested some tapatio crema, which sounded delicious, but I'll never know, as I honestly never spoke with the man again. 

After waiting an absurd amount of time, I flagged down another server and requested the box and a check, which she promptly returned with (too bad she wasn't our server). The guy that looked like a manager was milling around the whole time and seemed about as lost as Dorothy in Oz. 

I honestly have NEVER written a negative yelp review before, but this was quite possibly the worst service I have ever experienced. That being said, I really do like the food. The breakfast was good last time and the grilled cheese that o got tonight was phenomenal. I just hope that they can get it together so that they can stay open."}
{"text":"Great food and a patio where you can bring your puppy! We totally enjoyed the experience as did our pet!"}
{"text":"Great place ! Love thier happy hour. I have been here many time sit has never disappoints."}
{"text":"Had lunch today, got there around 11:30 so it wasn't busy.  Was seated quickly hot water quickly then it took forever for the server to come take the order.  We asked him to hurry cause we were starving.
Food was served in a reasonable time but my friend was served the wrong order the server had picked up the wrong dish!  
The food was fine and reasonably priced for lunch.   I had a friend who ate there a couple of weeks ago and had the same slow service at 8 pm on a Sunday evening.
Lazy dogs has some lazy service."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Lazy Dog for the first time this past Saturday. We knew it would be hot outside, as it is summer time in the desert! ;) But, we were determined to continue family night with our two golden retrievers. We love that the location is in Town Square and you can easily get to and park. I went inside to get us a table and within 30 seconds we were seated. The first server gave us our menu and took our beverage order and appetizer order. The Grizzly fries sounded delicious, and upon first bite - they were undercooked which was a bummer. The server came back and immediately she apologized and took them to get a new batch together. When she returned she said they had been taken it off the ticket for the mistake. Very nice of her to do, but that's not what I was expecting. Once our meals arrived, which I might add were delicious! Parmesan Chicken and Chicken Alfredo, the manager came out again after apologizing once and brought us a card to use for a dessert or appetizer the next time we are there. They didn't have to do that, but it made us feel appreciated as a customer! We will definitely be making this our family night dinner place. Thank you, Lazy Dog for taking care of us. P.S. Our dogs thank you as well. And for those of you who complain that they don't take care of your dogs, read the rules before you go. They are in a server environment and they can't \"love\" on your dogs, then go inside and serve others. Germs and dog hair spread fast! We were very happy with how they treated our pups, left them alone = calm dogs! ;)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times already. Everytime the waitress or waiter is very friendly and cheerful. The service is prompt and the food is always spot on. The bartenders make great cocktails too. 
Really great selection of beer too, but beware, the popular in house ones can sell out. 

Great place for a weekend dinner or even a quick weekday dinner.

Fyi, if you are a small party and don't want to wait for a table, the bar area is open seating for 1-2 peope at the bar or the bar tabletops."}
{"text":"Love this place; it's great for healthy eating as well as for splurges! Our server Ashley was great!"}
{"text":"I still daydream about my meal there. Everything on the menu sounds amazing. I got the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna & was not disappointed. The cauliflower mashed was perfect. My husband had the Fried Chicken dinner and was equally impressed. It took a traditional dinner to the next level. The bacon collard greens were perfection and the chicken was the best I've ever tasted with maple syrup on the coating to elevate it. We also tried some apps...green chile mac & cheese (good but nothing too extraordinary), loaded potato hush puppies (very good - a great twist on a loaded baked potato) and sweet potato bits...a definite hit!  We dined with kids and the meal was enjoyed by all."}
{"text":"We love this place, have yet to bring the pups yet...but the food is amazing and the server Alejandro is incredible! Great energy and menu knowledge is on point!  I have run restaurants for a long time and would pay to clone him and hire him over and over!  Go try it out if you haven't...or if you have, go in and ask to be sat in Alejandro's section, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here at Lazy Dog, and I will be coming back forsure! Their Cajun fries was super bomb!! And their Pink Lemonade was surprisingly super tasty. Channon is a such a cool server !  

DOG FRIENDLY RESTAURANT GETS 5 stars for me !!!"}
{"text":"After coming to Lazy Dog for the first time, I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to friends and family! Not only were the Happy Hour prices amazing, but the service was outstanding! It was super busy, but our server, Sam, continually checked in on us and was extremely helpful with food and drink suggestions! Thanks Sam and Lazy Dog for a fantastic evening out with friends!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back and try another dish from the menu. I had the Chicken Pot Pie which was Delish. My Wife had the Chicken Poblano. She was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. She actually ate the leftovers the next day for breakfast over scrambled eggs with corn tortillas on the side. Yummmo!
Our food & drinks came out fast. As soon as we were done with our appetizer, ceviche tostas, very fresh, yummy, our main courses were brought out. Our server, Jenn R was AMAZING!!!! She was very personable, knowledgeable & a joy to have. Truly what a customer wants in a Server!! Kuddos to Jenn R. We will definitely be returning & recommending The Lazy Dog to our Friends and Family."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new restaurant for lunch and I am glad we came here. The food was delicious and the price is reasonable. Our waiter (Oscar) was super attentive and nice! 
It was loud inside, but you have the option of sitting outside on the patio. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy dining at Lazy Dog Restaurant. Their menu has so many choices and I love their chicken tortilla soup! And don't get me started on the desserts!!!  The staff at this location are all so friendly and accommodating! If you are looking for some great comfort food I highly recommend Lazy Dog!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice already!  Service is great - multiple managers stopped by as well. I love the cucumber martini and Maggie's Snake River salad!!"}
{"text":"We visited this location twice to cheer up the dogs on a trip to Vegas. Ordered the chicken and rice combos for them and late night burgers off the happy hour menu for us. Service was quick and attentive; always had our cold waters full. The weather was typical for Vegas in June and they had the industrial size fans going in the patio. Wish more places had meals for dogs on their menu."}
{"text":"Dog friendly restaurant  I enjoyed my lunch while my puppy enjoyed his food are pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server Reagan was amazing!  So friendly and made fantastic suggestions!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty solid meal with friendly service and a decent burger.  The bun started to fall apart a bit halfway through, but the flavor was good and I enjoyed the sweet potato tater tots."}
{"text":"Was just there...and just left. Hostess was nice and seated me with my dog, and then I waited. And waited. And waited. And...waited. Watched the wait staff walk by, the manager (I assume) change TV channels.  I didn't get acknowledged let alone offered a drink.  It wasn't crowded outside by any means either. While it's a cool concept...it would have been nice to have been served.  We'll try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times and I am definitely a fan. From their fun drinks to the delicious entrees to the comfortable outdoor seating, it's always a win. Aside from the aforementioned things, Lazy Dogs does something really right, and that's customer service. Tonight my girlfriend and I were served by Jennifer - she was awesome! I got the chicken pot pie for the first time, and she got the campfire pot roast, which is one of our collective favorites. Both were amazing. I drank the housemate ginger beer (nice ginger zing and super refreshing) and she got the Jamaican lemonade, which is hard not to choose every time we go. Their alcoholic drinks are good too, St Ruby is choice. Tonight we got dessert, the s'mores brownie topped with a housemate toasty marshmallow. So. Good. I was so full but this had to happen. Jennifer took that extra step and gave my girlfriend not only an extra take-home container of gravy, but a separate one of the sautéed spinach that topped her pot roast. 

Anyway, we will of course be back because we haven't left dissatisfied once. Thanks Lazy Dog!"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. Great service and great food. We had Alina as a server and she was very attentive and friendly! I would suggest this to anyone looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"So my husband and I tryed this place tonight and I wasn't impressed. The best part of my meal was the cajun fries. My husband ordered the pot roast and the meat was tuff to pull apart, very disappointing.  We ordered dessert because it was our first time here and they looked good. My husband ordered the sea salt creme brulee, which was not good. I ordered the white chocolate brownie it was just ok but nothing special. The service was average at best. Overall we weren't really satisfied and will not return."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant for us so we were excited to try The Lazy Dog. 
It was fantastic!! Excellent service, yummy food and awesome atmosphere! I would definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my one year old here with my husband and it's nicer food, but was perfect for my son as well. The wait staff gave my son a toy when he was getting fussy and the waiter entertained him with faces and talked to him. It was the nicest place to go with our little one and didn't make us feel weird or awkward about him crying in the least! It was such a nice experience I'll go many times. Also all the food is made from scratch so feeding my soon the food didn't make me feel incredibly awful lol"}
{"text":"They have really great, different items here.  Candy bacon, grilled Brussels sprouts yum yum.  Only problem we couldn't eat all the food."}
{"text":"So we drive over to Summerlin and decided to go a little farther and check out Red Rock.  We are happy that we did as we found the Lazy Dog!  Great ambiance ( a little loud), food was served fairly quickly, and everything was it good quality.  I recommend the house specialty Chicken Tortilla Soup... A cup is more than enough to satisfy."}
{"text":"I've always heard of this place so I finally wanted to check it out!. Their menu is visually pleasing and has a wide variety of food. Great ambiance and great service as well. Food seemed to take a little longer to get out considering the small amount of people at the time but nothing to really complain about. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We ask for sitting outside and the whole time our waitress was beyond nice and helpful . He made sure we had everything we needed. We left happy and full  We loved everything! I can't wait  to come back and try new stuff ."}
{"text":"Perfect dog-friendly restaurant in Vegas! I attended the Make-A-Wish 5k walk a couple months ago and received a complimentary appetizer plus dog meal. I was ecstatic knowing we can check this place out and bring our Chloe-bear along. 

The doggy meals have only two options: choice of either chicken or hamburger patty with brown rice. Chloe's reaction to receiving her very own meal was like Christmas morning! (tearing it up). We ordered the BBQ Chicken Crisp pizza, All -American burger, and for dessert...banana pudding (drools). **BONUS** if you check-in on yelp, you can get free Cajun fries. They have a good selection of beers, surprisingly. My husband is a \"brewery guy\" and enjoyed their beer sampler, specifically Lazy Dog's house IPA.  

Their large outdoor patio dining has several fans around to keep the fur-babies cool and has the option to put down the sun shades in case it is extremely brutal out. We had a great time seeing other doggies, everyone enjoying themselves, friendly service. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but a little disappointed for allegedly having a \"completely scratch kitchen\" that the french fries that we served are your typical, nasty frozen restaurant fries.  It isn't that hard to make fresh cut fries and they are SOOOO much better, come on Lazy Dog, stop? bring so lazy and step it up a bit!  Service was very good!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   One of my favorites.   Great atmosphere.   Nicole was our server tonight and was super friendly and attentive..   If I can figure it out I'll attach what happens to a rack of ribs here.."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour here was great! The Nachos were one of the best things on the happy hour menu and the portion was huge. Our server Omar was great and accommodating. Excited to go back and try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here and wow, my Baja burger is crazy good!
Fries are perfect. Good job you guys!!"}
{"text":"Meet some friends for dinner and they recommended w met here at, Lazy Dogs.
Atmosphere is great. 
Mixed drinks were awesome!
Pineapple mojito ... Yup!
People in my party had the ribs, carbonara, lemon chicken pasta, fettuccine and California burger.
It's a great place to maybe just order drinks and appetizers.
I made a pledge to eat more fish this year sooooo ...
I ordered the Salmon.
It was glazed with a teriyaki sauce.
Veggies and brown rice accompanied.
Meh ... Nothing special.
I'll be back only to meet with friends again when I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So my parents are in town and we couldn't decide on a place to go eat.  I figured I'd take them to Lazy Dogs. I've been there once before and was t crazy about the food but figured since they have such a variety on the menu I'd give it another shot.  As we were looking over the menu options it said that most entrees come with a \"sidekick\".  The list of sidekicks were nowhere to be found on the menu.  When the waitress came by my father asked her where to find the sidekick list and she said \"they're in my book\" and walked away to help another table.  Ok, that doesn't help.  So she comes back and just hands my dad her book so he can read the options himself.  My mother, now putting on her reading glasses, read from the list also.  Isn't it the waitresses job to be helpful and courteous to her table? My father then asked what a \"Japanese cucumber salad\" was. Her reply was \"a cucumber salad with a fancy word in front of it\".  There was no further explanation.  Then she went on to talk bad about the company and how she doesn't like working there.  I gave it three stars because we actually all enjoyed our food that night but as for the service, I wasn't pleased."}
{"text":"Food was average at best, forgot more than half our order...we were a group of 12 ordering drinks and appetizers. Once it was time for the check, they had to keep changing the checks and taking the ones back they already gave us. 20 minutes process to pay the bill."}
{"text":"First time in, definitely won't be our last. Friendly service, fun atmosphere, excellent food! We only sampled appetizers this visit but can't wait to get back and try a few entrees! Finn was our server, she was great! If you haven't yet visited Lazy Dog, get in there!!"}
{"text":"Usually the food is good here, but not last night.  I ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken.  They served the dish but didn't serve the bread.  I asked for the bread and the waitress said they don't have bread but they have a thin garlic flatbread it is served with.  Told her that was fine.  I was very disappointed the chicken, which is an \"add\" to the dish wasn't a grilled boneless chicken breast.  Instead it was a couple chunks of chicken mixed in.  It was horrible looking and tasting.  Then came the bread ... seems they were out so they brought me what looked like Pita bread with a ton of oil and cheese on it.  It had so much oil it was actually soggy.   Sent meal back and dismissed waitress and manager.  For the record ... Never sent a meal back in my life and certainly never chewed out staff!  But come on ... don't put it on your menu if you don't even have all the ingredients!"}
{"text":"3rd time in a row i couldn't escape ordering the Noodle Pork Bowl on the weekend Menu..the broth is amazing with lime cilantro and chilli oil flavors..#shouldbeonthemenu"}
{"text":"Let me just say that we were excited to try this place and be able to bring our fur babies as well. Unfortunately there was a 45 minute wait which in and of itself is not a bad thing IF they had a waiting area that was actually dog friendly, meaning they have no water and little shade.  Vegas is 80 degrees in March can you imagine how awful July and August will be. For a restaurant that thrives on being dog-centric that doesn't seem very animal friendly to us."}
{"text":"Went to lunch a few times with some friends and we have never been disappointed. The servers are always friendly and know when to suggest certain things and they all seem to be very happy working here. It's one of the faves."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Lazy Dog.  Great service, good variety of food and drinks.  I had the lettuce wraps which was very good, my hubby and son had burgers.  They loved them.  The place is huge and in great location."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday night in very
early October. The weather was beautiful for
being outside on this evening so a place like
this is highly appreciated especially when 
you are on the road with your pooch. 
This location has a very nice large outdoor
patio that is well laid out.  An extremely 
dog friendly place with a doggie menu.
Morris ordered the grilled chicken breast
(without the rice) from the dog menu. 
I ordered the bison burger, medium rare
with a side of spinach. Also had an order
of the cajun fries which were a Yelp check
in promotion. 
The dog portion of chicken was enough for
Morris to get two meals out of it. Extremely
good value and generous for a doggie plate. 
I had a couple of Michelob Ultras which were
chilled but I like them a bit colder.
The bison burger had only caramelized onion
and bacon jam on it as I had requested. It was
cooked perfectly medium rare as requested 
and was a decent sized burger. The side of
sauteed spinach was really good too. 
The cajun fries were overcooked and I felt
that the seasoning was a bit disjointed. 
Our server was excellent except for charging 
for the fries, which she corrected. 
The menu offered a nice variety of choices and
overall it was a pretty decent chain restaurant. 
I appreciated that the restaurant has posted 
below their dog menu a set of patio rules 
for dog owners. These are all common sense 
but as someone who extensively travels with
Morris, I have found that there are some dog
owners that just don't get it. With that said... 
All the dogs there that night were well behaved.
Morris got to meet a couple of them. Worth
visiting again when I pass through again."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into this restaurant we had a great experience.  The ambiance, service, and food quality were all top notch. I love the fireplace and \"log cabin\" decor.  We were seated promptly and offered a garlic Flatbread as a welcoming for it being our first visit. We placed our orders and waited barely any time at all. Two burgers, a pot pie, bowl of corn chowder, and a kid's chicken teriyaki later, our appetites were fulfilled and cravings satisfied. We ended the night with the Butter Cake dessert, a butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, mint glazed strawberries, garnished with basil. To. Die. For. We will definitely be back, maybe with our pooch (seeing as how dogs are welcome on the patio seating)."}
{"text":"By far me of the best places we love to come.  Love the lazy dog IPA!! Food is amazing every time we come.  Our dog loves  the chicken and rice. Friendly atmosphere and great prices .. Thank you for coming to Vegas.. I always went to the one in l.a!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, we go almost every weekend!  The serving staff is awesome and they treat our puppy lime family.  Christine is a strong manager with great hospitality.  The tasty food is just sprinkles on top of the wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Solid food, service and environment. It's what I would expect for the price. I will definitely be back for their casual fare. I love the idea of the dog entrees for patio dining. Such a cool concept."}
{"text":"I'd drop a one star, but I'm going to go ahead and leave two as I will likely visit the Summerlin location again. Dropped into Lazy Dog yesterday (05/25/2017) to celebrate a promotion. I've been to this Lazy Dog once before, and the Summerlin location twice before. All three times previous, fantastic experiences. Five star experiences. I bring my (extremely well trained) German Shep/Lab mix who never barks, yelps, or lunges at others on the patio. Of those three previous occasions, there's only been one example of a poorly trained dog. A bark here and there, no biggie. But there was a dog at the Summerlin location that would just not quit it. And the server kindly let them know that if the dog didn't behave it would have to leave. Which is exactly what was written all over the menus and also on signs \"Avoid the three B's: Begging, Barking, and Biting\", and the website's Dog Policy. 

Last night, we arrived at approximately  6:30 pm. From that time through to 8:30 there were no less than 5-6 dogs CONSTANTLY barking. Yelping, screaming, constantly. No quit. Ever been to your local pound? It was like setting up a dinner table in the middle of it, and paying near strip prices for your drinks and food. Everyone with well behaved dogs, or with no dogs, were visibly annoyed by it. 

At the Town Square location, the reference to the \"Avoid the three B's\" is apparently gone entirely. I didn't see it anywhere on the new menus. Nothing posted on the walls outside or on placards. Nothing. 

The servers did absolutely nothing. I even asked one of the bussers: \"Don't you guys have a barking policy?\" and he openly laughed at my face and said no, we've never had a barking policy. They're dogs, they can bark as much as they want. Well, you may want to update your website to reflect that your patios are now meetups for untrained dogs. Because the \"Three B's\" is still posted under your dog policy. 

I will give the Summerlin location another shot, as they seem to care about following their company's posted policy. Not going to drop another $100 for a meal and drinks for two at the local animal shelter at Town Square, though."}
{"text":"WOW horrible again... I didn't want to go here but some friends wanted to try it first time.  Ask host to seat us near TV's to watch NBA playoff well that wasn't  happening place was empty. Sticky ribs extra dry... Beer glass had some sticky film on it.  Had a yelp checkin free cancun fries waitress charged us, had to have removed... Flies started show up in the middle of the meal... I can't believe I went back here... Grrr?rr..."}
{"text":"I decided to take my son and dog(Sammy) to this place I've been hearing about from a friend I'm gonna jump right into the bad the staff seemed a bit unorganized and confused I brought my dog inside and on 3 different occasions I had to tell them he is a service dog but we eventually settled for the patio. We sat for about 7-10 minutes before our server showed up to ask for drinks, sat for another 7-10 minutes just to get water for my dog. We ordered our food, spinach dip for appetizer which came out fairly quick. The main course took 20 minutes to come out I ordered bison meatloaf and son had cheese pizza and fries, they brought my food out but not my son but our server did recognize this and offered him some complimentary fruit. Now I have a large retriever and he quickly ate his food so I ordered him more again it took forever to come out. In all the food is good it's just the service I had a problem with I will probably give them another chance and my friend also said he received the same slow service as well when he went but I believe in second chances."}
{"text":"This place came as a recommendation from a friend who had an excellent experience while meeting her friends. Lazy Dogs is a fun night on any night of the week. The staff, ambience, and food was great to say the least. The flavors blend well together rather it be he ribs or the pasta.  I highly recommend the fire burn calamari over a bed of brown rice.  My girlfriend and I both ordered salads this time around and they were delicious. The Cobb is one of the best I've tasted and the Tex Mex was awesome too. For desert we had the white chocolate brownie (heaven). Overall great date night for my love. Please if you find yourself in downtown Summerlin, you have to try this place out."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's been so long or if something has truly changed but Lazy Dog didn't live up to my memory.  Everything was extremely small for the prices listed. The salmon on the salmon burger was about 1/4 of the size of the bun, the grilled cheese was very tasty, but small and the sweet tots, which they charge extra for, were each half the size of my thumb. 

If I had a coupon, or an immense craving, I would maybe go back for the grilled cheese, but other than that, I can get a bigger better piece of salmon elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went there to meet up with some friends, when I got there I told the hostess that my friends should be inside, she asked for my friends name and after checking, she told me to walk straight to the back. I told her It's my first time at lazy dog and she just smiled, I asked her if she can point me to right way and she just said, go back, I would have appreciate it if she had at least pointed it out to me or better yet walk me to our table.
The food was good. Our server was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I love taking our dog here. When we do that, we can only sit on the patio but that's when you take advantage of the beautiful weather we have! 

For the pups, the doggy food they get is definitely worth the money, as it's typically a large portion and all healthy items- chicken breast, rice, peas and carrots.

Even if you're not a dog person (we're probably not friends), the restaurant inside is beautiful, clean and always has a great, dynamic menu. The menu isn't overwhelming like some other large restaurants, yet has a handful of intriguing and delicious dishes. Bison meatloaf, yes please! I also love their short ribs and my husband enjoyed his ahi tuna.

TLDR: yummy food, great date night spot with the pup, great for groups, yummy food, good service."}
{"text":"We've dined here several times and each time to service is always great. The food is good, portions are good, and the price is low compared to the other dining options on downtown summerlin. It is always busy, and calling ahead doesn't guarantee a shorter wait time, they also don't do same day reservations, which is a little odd, but the food and service are good so we will be back!"}
{"text":"Finn is an outstanding server. She made our night memorable and we will be back. The butter cake she suggested was FINNtastic!!!"}
{"text":"To quote my husband, this place is basically \"a more expensive Applebee's.\" But with one big difference: It's dog friendly.

Although we did not have our dog with us, there were plenty of people with their pups on the patio. Looks like that would be a fun and novel dining experience. But, as we sat inside with the other dogless folks, I can only comment on the food, which was fine but nothing special.

I ordered lamb stroganoff with a wedge salad, because I make a mean lamb stroganoff and the spouse makes a killer wedge. I wanted to see how they did it here, and while it's always unfair to compare a restaurant's food with your own, I think they should have put \"Our take on ...\" in front of each of these menu items, because they were far from traditional. The wedge salad was lacking bacon, and instead of blue cheese dressing, there was a ranch-style dressing with blue cheese crumbles on top. The addition of tomatoes and onions was also unneeded and unnecessary. All in all, not a good start. The stroganoff was much better, although it was served on fettucine instead of egg noodles and there was a pronounced lack of sour cream. That said, the lamb was delicious, and I loved the mushrooms and peas (which I haven't used in my recipe, but maybe now I will!).

My husband had fish and chips, which is one of his standard orders. Their take on this dish was to mold the fish into burger-shaped patties and to give thin-cut fries instead of fat potato wedges. The fish was greasy, and the fries weren't very tasty. Another dud.

Service was a bit slow, but the place was packed so I can't fault our waitress. Although the menu items we selected weren't all that great, I would be willing to give Lazy Dog another try, maybe next time with pooch in tow!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a lazy dog near henderson. I'm from West Covina CA and was missing this place. The food is delicious as always. My favs are the chile verde nachos, bison meatloaf, and ahi tuna burger! You could never go wrong with these 3 choices. Good selection of beer and as always a very friendly staff at the bar area! I will definitely be back! Glad to have them here! Good place to watch your sports games. Best part is they are pet friendly on the patio. I use to take my fur babies to the West Covina location with me."}
{"text":"Great cocktails.  Great food and excellent service.  It is cool that they cater to people with dogs.  Long waiting time on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Carrie S at the bar was amazing, she was very helpful with recommendations on our brunch choices.  Brooke was great as well, very pleasant and accommodating staff.  The maple bacon old fashion was delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great environment! Was able to get seated right away in a Sunday night. Can definitely get crowded on a Friday or Saturday. Overall great service with plenty of parking. They have a nice drinking menu as well to choose from."}
{"text":"Love this place we were so happy to see it come here to the valley we have one back home and we're thrilled to come visit this one in Summerlin. Our waitress was great and the food was amazing as expected"}
{"text":"They can't even get your order right. Kitchen is new & cant even get an ahi Tina salad or veggie burger right. They try to compensate with a comp desert or appetizer after eating when trying to eat healthy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Same thing happened last time I was here & thought I'd give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"This is a big establishment! Kind of reminds me of Claim Jumper, the way the plates are large and with the warm, cabin-like decor. This was a nice place to eat with friends and the NCAA Football National Championship was on that evening, so we could watch the game as well - lots of TVs.

I can't help but think the place is overpriced, though. You DO get large plates, but it's not really a place I'd go often. While everyone enjoyed their meal, I didn't see many menu options that seemed extra special. I would love to come back again when it's a little warmer and bring my dog. I hear the patio is nice for that and enjoying a drink with friends, although I've never done it.

I had the Hawaiian BBQ short ribs with fries and it was very tasty! Definitely try the chocolate lava cake-type dessert. We all shared a few desserts at the suggestion of our waiter and I'm glad we listened to him."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Jacob our waiter nice polite. Very professional. Great food here as well, and the draft beer ice cold how cold ice cold. Second time here both times great service. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"My 2 legged and 4 legged friend come here to eat dinner, we loved it so much!! The food was amazing, very unique, GREAT variety... Something for everyone, including foods just for the pups! Decently priced with a wonderfully relaxing/elegant atmosphere! Thank you to Arizona and Amanda for keeping us well fed, entertained and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We dined here last night. The service is 5 star. Our server was wonderful. 
The food however was not good. 
I ordered the lemon caper chicken. The flavors of the ingredients did not meld together. Nothing had flavor. The garlic spinach overpowered the dish. The chicken was the least flavorful. It almost appeared to be boiled. 
My husband had the pot pie. He ate it all of it. He also felt there was no flavor. 
I only tried a small piece of the crust. And it was ok. 
I have to say I would not return."}
{"text":"Favorite place to dine ..we had an awesome  waiter, Alejandro, awesome dude and on top of everything.. today we celebrated our 7 yr wedding anniversary and he surprised us with this delicious desert butter cake..great dinner with family tonight"}
{"text":"Great selection of food and portions are sizeable.  Prices are fairly reasonable and we didn't have to wait too long during the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently with the whole family. Service was pleasant, friendly, and quick. The place was a little noisy indoors. They do have a nice patio which you can bring your pet to. 

The food selection was average, but the taste and flavors were pretty good. 

We shared the Smores dessert at the end which was delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service! Able to accommodate small and large groups. Bar area, indoor and outdoor dining available. Ordered garlic flatbread, Cajun fries, Caesar salad, sun-dried tomato pesto pasta, and Mahi fish tacos. All were yummy. Definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Super friendly service. Great and varied menu that is reasonably priced. Wonderful ambience with great acoustics - my dinner partner and I could hear each other (not always the case at some places). I had a cheeseburger and fries that was excellent and really hit the spot. And they are dog friendly - what's not to love!"}
{"text":"I went to Lazy Dog on a Friday night & of course they were busy & we had to wait. But the food was good. The veggie burger was yummy- moist & flavorful. Service was average.  Would definitely come again - maybe for lunch when not so busy and bring my dog & sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"We ordered crispy wings and their wok calamari for apperizers. The wings were good and the calamari was amazing. Drinks were served on time and everything looked great. We ordered the NY steak, pesto pasta, and their chicken sandwich. The pasta and sandwich and pasta came out great but the ny steak wich was ordered medium rare came out badically raw. They told me that they would make a new steak and it would be around 8 minutes. By then the pasta and sandwich were finished and we were ready to leave. Other than that the service was good. For it not being busy the kitchen couldve done alot better."}
{"text":"I did a major move on Thursday and figured I come here to enjoy a really good meal. I ordered the Sundried Tomato Pesto ($14.95) which is Fusilli Pasta with cubed tender and juicy chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, onions, sundried tomato, and a drizzle of walnut-pesto cream sauce. Also I ordered a side of French Fries ($4.25) which were well-done, hot and crispy, and I was happy it was delivered along side with my meal. I noticed a major improvement with the food quality. The flavor of the pasta is delicious with that walnut-pesto cream sauce. And I do enjoy their consistent, friendly, and attentive service. Overall, my meal is very filling and satisfying and the people who work here are wonderful. I wouldn't mind coming back to dine in. At Lazy Dog, there is no need for formality. The atmosphere is really nice, it's pretty casual, and it's the kind of happy-go-lucky environment I definitely vibe with."}
{"text":"Excellent service, but cooks and food prep should know the difference between rare and medium in a burger.

Won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time having dinner and drinks last night. The slow braised pork shoulder was very tasty and the drinks kept coming. My only issue was when they changed servers, the guy who took over for us was not very polite. He seemed to be upset when we asked him to split our tab. Otherwise we all had a good time!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. I have loved everything I have ever ordered from here. I have been here many times. They have items that are delicious that are lower in calories if you're concerned about that. 1 Star off for horrendously loud environment. I could not hear my waiter, he could not hear me. The people in our party had to yell at each other to be heard. I would have left, but we were hungry and had waited 1/2 hour to be seated. That was getting on a call ahead wait list. Boo. It was louder than normal because it was the NBA playoff game and the TV was up extremely loud. That would be ok in the bar area, but it was all over the entire restaurant. It was not enjoyable for me."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  My husband has been here before for lunch with a work crowd.  He had the grilled cheese sandwich and said it was amazing, so we decided to give it a try for dinner.   The service was amazing! There were so many choices, it was difficult to decide, but everyone liked what they got.  We ordered the Grizzly Fries for an appetizer.  It looked small, but it was soooo good and very filling.  We had the black and bleu hamburger with fries, very good.  I had the Bison Burger...cooked medium. I felt it was under cooked, but better undercooked than overdone.  And it tasted so good!  The Cole Slaw was very good as well.  My husband had the BBQ Bison meatloaf, which was recommended by the waiter.  So good.  I had the jamaican lemonade which was also good.  I had ordered a coke before I realized that they had some awesome alcohol free drinks from the bar.  I ordered Jamaican lemonade.  My waiter brought me that and also kept bringing refills of my coke and didn't charge me extra for it.  I appreciated that.  I ordered the white chocolate pretzel cheesecake for desert for all of us to share.  It was amazing and since it was my birthday, the waiter got permission to make that complimentary.  We had a excellent experience.  I liked the decor.  It was noisy, but I would expect that for a place like this.  It's not in a casino, which is a plus for me, as I hate walking through the smoky casino to get to the restaurant.  I will come back here again and again.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time it's pretty cute idea that people can bring their dogs and the dogs have a menu also my kids thought it was so nice. Shane was our server for the evening and we where a big party I thought he would have another assistant with him like they normally do but I was shocked how fast he got everything down . He was extremely nice and helpful and when one of our orders didn't come out he made sure to take care of it and gave us 2 on the house desserts . He had a great attitude and helped us all out for us to be satisfied . I had the ribs it was a little dry but still good but their corn salad that comes with it was amazing . Also their tortilla soup was very tasty also . Overall I liked the place it was very well designed and had a good stock in the bar ."}
{"text":"I was not thrilled with this restaurant. Quality of food was mediocre or poor for the price they charge. Service was slow. :("}
{"text":"I've come here more times than I'd like to actually admit, but long story short I come for the same reason every time! The sticky ribs and umami fries, with a Cobb salad regular balsamic dressing. MOST times it's a quick stop in and service is great! Staff is always incredibly attentive and friendly. SADLY this time I came in, my entire order was wrong. EVERY single thing I ordered came out wrong, and I had to send back my salad 3x, I get it it's march madness, you are busy BUT if I had to tell you what the ingredients in your own food item something is wrong. HAPPILY though this place is amazing the manger was great, took care of everything and my dessert. People are so quick to write bad things, when service fills the void of bad kitchen mistakes that's what makes or breaks a restaurant! Mason my waiter , super apologetic! Thanks for a good dinner! I shall be back for foodies again soon!"}
{"text":"It's always been a favorite especially the corn wheels, sadly I arrived today and found out they are no longer on the menu. 
From start to finish our waitress Katie, was amazing.

My G-MA is sometimes hard to please just cause she's allergic to literally everything. 
But she managed to take our requests with ease,
Such a genuine personality. 
She topped it off at the end when my G-MA asked for wipes since she enjoyed their BBQ ribs ! It was absolutely delicious btw.

She soon came back and said we were out of wipes but I brought back a damp cloth for you. 

You can always make someone's experience good with genuine customer service! 
She's a gem! We enjoyed, our grandma and granddaughter dinner a little extra tonight with her help!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because I love the fact that you can bring your dog! How fun is that! The food was good. Nothing special but it was way better than I expected. The patio is very nice. I like the fire pit they have. They do have fans out there but if they had misters being in this heat that would be awesome! I would have gave this place 5 stars but I felt like the service was mediocre. I understand the servers aren't allowed to touch the dogs, but I went on a very hot summer evening and the server didn't even offer my dog water, I had to ask! My dog loved his food though! The portion was way bigger than I expected! He ate all of it he was a very happy camper! I will come back to this place for the simple fact I can bring my dog!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have had great service! The Cajun fries in the beginning is a must! I got their bison burger and it was very delicious! Great for happy hour as well! If you have a dog I'm sure he or she will love the place also haha"}
{"text":"First time here. We ate between 3 and 4 and the service was great. Food great too. I had the Bahamas chicken and I really liked it. Multiple servers helped when necessary.  Gotta love that! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful designed building and excellent food. Plus very pet friendly."}
{"text":"Large casual restaurant with a big food menu ... It's like a slightly upscale Applebee's or Chills. 

The menu is comprised of fun food staples like burgers, salads, flatbreads and ribs... Something for everyone.  Bring your appetite- large portions and copious fried items abound.  Everything I've tried on the menu is solidly average in its category... No complaints, no surprises, but nothing to rave about. 

On every visit, the service has been spotty at best... Slightly inattentive and a bit slower than what you want... but friendly enough not solicit a complaint... again, on par and expected for this type of establishment. 

It's actually a good place to bring an indecisive group of family members for that meal where you're just trying to minimize complaints... Everyone will leave full yet slightly unsatisfied. 

Late night happy hour has some very good deals on bar food and drinks."}
{"text":"Yes, this really is a place where you can take your dog to lunch or dinner. As long as you're in outdoor seating, they will bring your dog a bowl of water and rice and chicken or a hamburger. If you're not a dog fan, make sure you sit inside. 

The restaurant has fun with the dog theme, but doesn't do so to the point of sacrificing quality of food. The portions and prices are decent, the presentation is nice, and the staff is kind and helpful.

It's a great place for meeting friends or business partners for lunch."}
{"text":"One star because I can't give a negative or zero. Came in with a large party so we expected a wait. They said 30 to 40 mins. An hour later they said 20 more minutes. We waited. After 20 minutes they said they were setting up our table. 20 minutes later they told us they were waiting on one man to leave so they lied. We counted 3 parties  of 4 being seated in minutes. Yea, pretty pissed off."}
{"text":"Good for Cajun fires Good for my dog."}
{"text":"Far and away the best service I have had at a restaurant in Vegas. Went here for Mother's Day. The food was great and delivered quickly. Small issue with one dish that was immediately remedied. The chef and manager came out to make sure it was corrected!  Natalie/Natalia? Our waitress from Orange County was amazing. The strawberry bunds cake was one of the best desserts I have ever had. Thank you! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So, I'm a little late to the party with this one! (Personally, I had a bad experience the first time I went!) However, we were in the mood for a late night happy hour and I found theirs here on Yelp! Automatically I was super impressed. HUGE happy hour menu with great prices! We got tons of food. My opinions about happy hours is..
\"If the table isn't covered, you aren't doing it right.\"

Therefore, I completely recommend grabbing a patio seat (with your dog because they're allowed to sit out there and that's awesome) and going during happy hour. It's 100% worth it! 

Happy Hour food recommendations: Mac N' Cheese, Sweet Potato Tots, Buffalo Chicken Lollipops, Cajun French Fries (Check in with Yelp! And get these for free), Edamame, and Burrata and Heirloom Tomato Crisp!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Can't wait to come back with my dog.  Very large servings, so either split or plan on taking some home!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The food and drinks are amazing. Had the inside out quesadilla and it was absolutely delicious!  I highly suggest any of their sangrias. I had the sangria sampler and not only is the presentation good, but their sangrias was delicious as well!  The fish and chips were to die for!  I can't wait for the town square location to open. I wish I remembered our servers name as she was amazing and very fast!  I'm definitely a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Everything we have tried has been awesome. Chicken pot pie, spinach feta chicken salad are both great."}
{"text":"My friend took me here at the last minute dinner the other night had a really great time fun atmosphere good food lots of laughs... Also have a great patio area that's pet friendly... Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Went to the newly opened Lazy Dog in Downtown Summerlin after trying their location several times in San Diego which we always enjoyed.

The location is great and the restaurant was clean and decorated well. You can tell all the servers were properly trained because they were extremely friendly and knew the extensive menu very well. They had a great happy hour menu and have both an early and late night happy hour which is great.

I ordered the cucumber mint martini which was fantastic and on the happy hour menu. We also tried the inside out quesadilla which was phenomenal, with crispy cheese on the outside of the quesadilla, a concept I want to go home to try! It was also on the HH menu, so for only $4 or $5 bucks, everyone should order it at least once!

I ordered a personal black and bleu pizza from the happy hour menu and a side salad since the  pizza is only 6 inches. The pizza was great with the strong taste from the bleu cheese and a generous portion of bacon. My side salad was amazing as it could be. Most restaurants use cheap lettuce and ingrediants, but this one was very tastey,

My husband ordered thai noodles which was a generous portion of pad thai with chicken. My husband found a small eggshell in the dish, which showed they use fresh ingrediants and the manager came by immediately to handle the situation and gave us his meal for free. 

We also ordered the key lime cheesecake which was perfect to share and delicious at only $5. Overall, food was great, service was excellent (I highly recommend Kara/Cara), drinks came out quickly, and the restaurant was clean and ambiance great. This will def be our happy hour go to in the area!"}
{"text":"My mom invited me to dinner tonight to celebrate my recent birthday, as it being my first time here I was excited to give it a try finally! The hostess had a big smile on her face when I walked in, it was busy so we got stuck on a regular wood table but the spacing between tables was decent and I was never uncomfortable like at most restaurants not being at a booth. I feel bad I can't remember our waitress' name but she was so nice and when I complained that I wasn't a fan of the pasta I originally ordered she offered me a menu and let me reorder without hesitation and said I should not feel bad, some food isn't for everyone. For an appetizer we ordered the hummus which was AMAZING. For a drink I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade - not terrible but I've had better. Originally I ordered the Lemon Caper Pasta but as I said before - NOT A FAN. I replaced it with the Carbonara and WOW! Why didn't I order this in the first place? I asked myself! I will definitely return and next time I will hopefully have room for dessert. My mom also mentioned I can sit on the patio with my pugs, which if it wasn't so cold out I would totally consider doing but maybe in the future during the summer!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog is one of my favorite place, atleast when I want to go somewhere with my dog. It is the only place I know which openly allows dogs. The plus side is they allow dogs, the down side is you have to be outside, which is fair. My only complaint is sometimes it can get cold in the winter months when eating outside. They even have dog dishes consisting of hamburger or chicken with white or brown rice. And they bring out a bowl of water for the dog as well which is nice. Ok, enough about the dog food.

The food there is great, and there is a widddde variety to choose from. Whatever you're in the mood for, from pizza to thai noodles to chicken sandwiches to cheeseburgers, they got it. I personally love the bleu cheeseburger. I also tried the thai noodles with chicken which was good too. Considering it isn't an authentic thai place they did a nice job making it and the portion was huge.

The location is perfect at the Summerlin mall area. After I'm done eating at the lazy dog it is nice to walk over to other stores and sometimes the farmers market is out.            I really don't have any complaints about lazy dog. If you want to go to a restaurant and bring your pet, this place lets you. Not to mention they have several tvs so you can watch the sports or whatever big game is on. Typically I eat at buffalo wild wings or twin peaks but if there is a game on and I want to bring my pet then Lazy Dog is the place to be. I highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time (officially) as a diner recently, right after the Breast Cancer Walk, that was held in front of Red Rock Casino. 

Had been to their sister restaurant previously with another friend once, to pick up food for her doggy. This is a unique restaurant as it is one of the few that allows dogs (outside patio only) with a small menu for dog's. Of course there are some rules to follow but hey, easy enough if you have them trained well. 

The restaurant opened at 0900AM on Sunday which was 2 hours earlier than it usually does on weekdays, and 1 hour earlier than it does on Saturday. 

There was a few parties from the same walk here already when we had arrived. We were a party of 12 so i thought we'd have some trouble in getting some seating arranged. They had asked us if we had a reservation, when i answered \"no\", the hostess had a mild disappointment/sad emotion but stated it would take 10 - 15 minutes for our table to be ready. That in itself was really surprising and we were happy. Indeed, we were seated in 10 - 15 minutes. Surprisingly, we weren't the largest party in the restaurant. 

We were greeted by our server (Gerardo) fairly quickly and had drinks served. One of our friend's had a yelp check in offer for free fries. 4 of us had checked in and did not see this offer. Not sure why? I have heard about some offers being random so i just left it at that. One of my friends had asked the waiter about this and he said he would ask his manager about it. A few minutes later, we had told us manager had allowed 2 more orders for us.

Cajun Fries - Crispy french fries with cajun seasoning and a side of chipotle ranch dipping sauce 

YUMMY ! When we had originally got that 1st plate, the fries were disappearing fast. I decided to move the fries back to the person who ordered it before it disappeared in front of us. These fries are DANGEROUSLY DELICIOUS ! (i dont say this much). When 2 more orders came, we went at it. Very well seasoned. Deliciously crispy and well made. That dipping sauce wasn't even needed ! Best cajun fries i've ever had ! 

Hair of the Dog Bloody Mary - Vodka, tomato juice, black pepper, fresh lime + horseradish, garnished with olives, pickled green beans + celery

This was the brunch cocktail i had picked. I haven't had a bloody mary in ages and thought it was worth the try at the cost of $5. Pretty good pricing. Granted it was smaller than what i've seen what other restaurants offer but it was still fairly decent sized. I tasted the vodka and tomato juice, and some lime (since i squeezed that wedge of lime into my drink). Black pepper, horseradish was indistinguishable. Celery was a bit weird XD Surprisingly the pickled green bean was tasty. I don't really like olives but i ate that anyway XD (asian habits of not wasting food). As for the drink itself, eh. Was ok. I think there are better versions. 

Was pretty indecisive with what i wanted to order. Not much of a breakfast/brunch fan typically so didn't really know what to order. Especially from the Brunch menu

Country Chicken + Biscuit - crispy fried chicken, housemade chicken sausage, two sunny side up eggs, housemade buttermilk biscuit, cajun gravy, spiced maple syrup

Aside from this one, i had my eyes on the housemade carnitas + tater tot hash. Some other friends ordered it and it looked really good. The country chicken and biscuit was ok. The biscuit was pretty yummy. The housemade chicken sausage was not that good. Less \"bite\" than i had expected from a sausage. The fried chicken was mildly dry and definitely wasnt crispy anymore. The gravy was good to mop up with the biscuit. Couldn't really tell the maple syrup was spiced or any different from a normal syrup. XD

My friend had ordered the pork fried rice. It includes smoked bacon, pork sausage, veggies + cabbage, topped with an egg omelette. The fried rice was very typical from an american establishment. Includes shredded carrots, and peas... Lol the rice was a bit undercooked and hard. The omelette is the weirdest part of all. Ok omelette on top of fried rice. Doesn't sound that weird right? But this omelette... was like... a dry quiche, without all the unique characteristics of a quiche and ingredients.. It seemed like it was thrown in a round pan and thrown into an oven for a long period of time... or even worse, microwaved. WORST \"OMELETTE\" EVER ! 

Price wise for the brunch items, was very good. Most items were under $10, which was quite cheaper than most things on their main menu. 

Best item we had was the fries definitely. Service was great as well. My water was always filled quickly. Very attentive server (Gerardo). Weird that he asked to make a review with him in it but hey, he did do a good job. So it was deserving. If anything, this helped me notice his name and be able to recall it in this review. HAHA works out i guess. 

Overall, decent place. Good service. Hopefully other food is better XD I'd like those fries again though. om nom nom"}
{"text":"My best friend and I do weekly dinner dates to catch up, and are usually found frequenting the same four or so different restaurants.  One night a few weeks ago, I wanted to check out something different for our planned outing.  

Upon searching good ol' Yelp, I found this little place.  The reviews were good, the location was close, and the concept seemed intriguing.  We went on a Wednesday night, and while it was very busy (surprising given the other restaurants around Town Square seemed a bit quiet), we didn't have to wait for a table or for our server to come over and get our drink orders.

The menu had a great selection, that I was actually having a hard time choosing what I wanted.  When we finally ordered, our food came relatively quickly and my oh my was it good.  My dining partner said the burger was average - not amazing quality, but on par with other burger chain family restaurants.  My pasta was delicious and I think I might have swallowed half of it whole.

Our water glasses were filled quickly, and the server consistently checked in on us to make sure we were all okay.  The place itself seemed nice and relaxing, and I felt comfortable there which is a huge plus.  When we finally completed our meal, we didn't feel rushed to get out of there or anything like that.  It was a very night evening.

All in all, definitely will be checking this place out again in the future."}
{"text":"Just a quick review for Lazy Dog.  We had ordered a steak that we have had a couple times before and it came out tough and way overdone.  I think this was a fluke but my review is for the manager and customer service.  The manager gave us a free steak AND our steak for free along with some appetizer coupons!  We told him it was fine and he insisted!  Now that is customer service and we will be back!  Gisselle, our waitress was also Very accommodating!!!  Even had them turn down the air when she saw I was cold.  I love having people \"pay attention\" and take care of their customers!  Thank you Lazy Dog Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the staff was super friendly. Dominique has helped us a lot and welcomed us with a friendly smile. Fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Great fun spot to eat outside with your best 4 legged friend.  Food good and reasonable."}
{"text":"It's a great meet up place in Summerlin. The location is excellent and easy to find. Edamame is my favorite. I have been here quite a few times but the food don't impress me at all. Everything is just mediocre. Overall the place is good."}
{"text":"Another good one gone :( I'm a vegetarian and this was one of the go to places. They changed the veggie burger recipe and it's inedible garbage that falls apart. I live with 4 other vegetarians and they all agreed it's terrible. Also the Brussels sprouts which used to be great light lemon flavor with crispy croutons has become a kitchen sink flavored mush. I called to give feedback on the veggie burger and maybe order something else and he didn't even apologize. Just matter of fact stated they changed the recipe and to call door dash and file a complaint. Bad service. Bad food. Time to let this one go :( loved bringing my dog though"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! The atmosphere here is great. We always sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. If you have a dog, you can bring them to eat with youtoo. The service is awesome and everyone there is super cool. The food is to die for. It's slowly becoming our favorite place to eat. We tell anyone who wants to try somewhere new to go there and they all love it too."}
{"text":"Food was good waiter could have been more attentive to our needs. 
Water and other drinks ran out and took a while to get more.
Food was okay, nothing super fantastic.  Kinda over priced which 
almost everything in Vegas is."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Went with a big group on my first visit. Girlfriends on my second and family on my third. Safe to say I enjoy this place."}
{"text":"My fave place for brunch! 
I love the hummus trio to share...their chicken salad sandwich...and a bloody Mary...yummo! 
When having out of town guests, this is always our \"go to\" spot, lots of options and they never disappoint! 
Customer service is just as awesome as the food.
Ohhh...and that butter cake...a MusT trY!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night. Everything was perfect from the host to the service, the food was delicious. I ordered the sweet and spicy shrimp. I  definitely would order it agian."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and house made ginger beer lots of people around!
Friendly bartender Tanya  will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be like a regular sports bar, but the food is extremely good - like better than it's peers. On top of that, I have to say... the customer service on the last two occasions was over the top exceptional. Will return."}
{"text":"Cute place to bring your fur baby that's about it.  Terrible service and understaffed outside..Ordered 1 appetizer 3 lunches and 1 pet meal.  Waited almost 40 min before i walked inside to see where our appertizer was and our waitress sounded surprised it wasn't out yet. Sat back down and our lunch arrived but with no pet meal (40 min later and no appetizer before) Appetizer came after the food and i had to go inside a second time to ask where our pet meal was..at this point we were feeding our dog food from our plate! 1 hour and 5 minutes later our pet meal came. I told the waitress we won't be paying for our appetizer or the pet meal we ordered and she said that was fine. It wasn't very busy either. 
I've been there a handful of times and i've noticed 2 things also... They are in NO rush to buss the dirty tables whatsoever. Literally a table has sat dirty our entire time there.. Nothing like eating next to a dirty table. Secondly the food is very so so but they honestly have the most tasteless, bland chicken fingers i have ever had in my life, ever!
I would go and just have drinks on the patio with our dog next time if anything."}
{"text":"Service was A+
Food was B+

So why only three stars? Little bugs (fruit flies?) all over the place. On my plate, the table and probably in the food. I said something to the waiter and he replied that they know about it and had exterminators in to deal with the problem. Evidently not successfully.
This is a serious health concern. I'm surprised no one has mentioned it."}
{"text":"Great spot. Good food very spacious. Regan was a great server. I recommend the strawberry lemonade for non alcoholic. All the beer here is good."}
{"text":"My first time at a lazy dog. Great food, plenty of draft beer choices, doggie menu (beef or chicken or carrots with peas and rice), and fantastic service. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night with 2 hungry kids and no reservation and yet got promptly seated, no waiting! What else can you ask for!
Very pleasant ambiance, best part you can bring your pets! 
My husband ordered the soy glazed salmon which was great, I had the queso dip and bowl of tomato soup. Both were excellent. Soup was served perfectly hot, which I really appreciate. I don't like when soup is served warm. 
Very reasonably priced drinks, we had a bottle of bubbly for $20! 
Service was ok, some minor ordering issues, which were promptly corrected and an unclean wine glass, other than that everything was great. Our server was very pleasant. 
kids menu is great, they have all the kids favorites cheeseburger, hotdogs, pizza, pasta, drink and side included, my boys wiped their plates clean. 
Would def recommend for a causal family dinner night."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Love the concept of being able to take my dog to a restaurant with me. Service is just average nothing to rave about and a little on the slow end but they are friendly. The food is just ok. Nothing special. They do make delicious cocktails so I will definitely got for that and to bring my dog."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. I came here with my husband and 2 kids. None of us loved the food but nothing was terrible either. The best thing was there were a lot of tv's for viewing sports. It's a convenient spot if you're already at town square. But I wouldn't make the trip just to dine here."}
{"text":"Too many other options to return.  We've tried this place 3 times...STRIKE OUT!  Honestly the food is decent; but there a real issues with this place.  First time was at lunch and it took FOREVER and entrees came out 1 at a time. Waiter was completely flustered.  The second time was after the dinner rush and my husband and I sat at the bar.  We could hear voices screaming and people walking around in a huff.  Disgruntled customers were treated terribly when they voiced their disappointment with their service and food.  The third time we had dinner on the patio with the dogs.  While it's a nice patio; I'm not so sure I like servers petting dogs and then delivering meals...I'm sure it happens.  But again the service was terrible.  15 minutes to get a cocktail.  The waiter apologized for the long wait; but basically ignored us and wouldn't make eye contact.  Other parties seated after us were served way before we were. Finally another server delivered our food and said she was taking over our table.  Not sure if our original guy quit or got fired; but we saw him leaving the property as we finished our meal.  I can only guess that management and training here is terrible and there is a lot of trickle down negative behaviors going on.  Never again."}
{"text":"Racist treatment by the hostess.  Went to this establishment today with my 3 grandchildren and although the restaurant was only half full the hostess who was a young white lady choose to sit me and my grandkids who are African Americans all the way in the back next to the restroom.  It was so obvious as we walked by at least 8 similar empty tables.  Won't waste my $$$ here ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to bring your dog. I like coming here with my dog, since the staff is very attentive and always offer me Bella a water bowl. I like the Bison Burger and there fry's. I have also asked the waitress/waiter to give me suggestions or better yet, take my menu and surprise me, and everytime their picks are deliciously perfect. If you feel like a beer try their flight, I thinks it's 4-6 samples. They also have a convenient dog menu. My dogs favorite is the brown rice and grilled chicken, the portions are good for $5 bucks, my chihuahua only eats half the mean and she litterity take a doggie bag home, lol."}
{"text":"\"Based on the owners website and marketing effort 
( great marketing) ( got-me in the door )I expected 
More than ambiance. 
I expected food you'd be proud to wow your friends with. 


Atmosphere :
5 Stars I loved the open lodge , and tunes ambiance. 

Service :
5 Stars. Fast , and just enough personality shared with the server. 

Food...meh!
Sweet potato tater tots. Great dipping sauce. Rather hard and greasy for my taste. 

Martini. 4 Stars. Great unique flavor. 

Ribs: quite sweet. Quantity of meat on the bone-very very sparse. The side of fries had a fancy name ( umami) w.t.frick, They were mediocre Applebee's,Red Robin quality. not worth eating I expected more fir the price. 

Pork shank. Flavor great. Quantity of meat.....adequate, yet the surface of the pork was dry. I expected better for  the price. 
The pork rested on a side of spicy Kimchee flavored rice. Way too spicy and was a serious detractor to the pork. Not. Good match 
Pork shank is a more delicate flavor imho.
Polenta or cous cous , lightly, or not at all spiced would've been a better , and less costly food marriage. 
I walked out tasting kimchee flavor on my palate , not pork. 

I think it's a food sin to plate a main, with a side that is stronger. 

Two mains 
One appetizer 
Three drinks 
99.00 plus 20 tip. 

120.00 was way to much for what  we ate. 

It's an 80 dollar experience. Not 120.

Not planning on returning.
Again..

{"text":"Service is good. People are friendly. The food is bland. We ordered the chicken pot pie and the pot roast. Both were lacking in flavor and the 3 prices of chicken in my pot pie were each about the size of their salt shakers so not really \"hand shredded\" with attention to detail. Two stars because they had a decent beer list, but if I'm going to eat out at a massive chain restaurant, in the future, I'll go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Our server, Katrina, was very helpful and attentive.  She was great with the children.  Good attitude.  The food was okay, but over seasoned.  Will probably go again."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is popular. I went at 6 pm on a Thursday night and it was packed. We were quickly seated on the patio and our server was really nice, helpful and patient. He helped me find out what dishes could be made vegan* and was quick with a beer suggestion. I'm more of a cat person, but it was cute to have dogs out on the patio. The mason jar drink of the month is Jameson & Ginger. I'll be back for that! 

*Short Rant: I think the vegans need to hire the gluten-free PR people. It seems every restaurant will have special GF menus or notations of GF items. Typically for vegan options I only see this happen at restaurants that already cater to vegetarians/vegans. Okay...rant over. Enjoy your dinner!"}
{"text":"On the fence about Lazy Dog !! 

First our service ... The gentleman was super nice and asked if this was our first time which it was and explained everything about the restaurant and that's awesome but at the same time was a little to talkative! That's not a bad thing but when you are having a family meal could be a little to much ! He was very informative and attentive to our needs the entire time ! 

From what we got out of him was that the son of the owner of Mimi's was the one who owns Lazy Dog and everything is scratched made in house ! 

Now both my wife and I started with a beer sampler of their own craft beers , and I must saying they were all very good !! We also like the fact that you can actually bring your dogs with you and eat on the patio and they will bring out water and they have a doggy menu !! Pretty cool....

As far as the food was not as impressed . My son and I both ordered the Ahi sandwich which was good but not great ! My wife had a pizza and I must say very low level and bland !! The grizzly fries were not bad but very sweet !! I feel that to many restaurants try to get to creative with sauces and that can hurt you in a way ! That was the case with the Ahi tuna sandwich! There were two types of sauce the Wasabi Ranch which I liked and a sesame sauce that was over powering ! 

The sweet sauce took away from the fries and did not go over well with my son ! We will give another shot !!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lazy Dogs at Town Square several times, but this was my first time at the location in Summerlin. Came on a Saturday night around 7:00pm and were able to be seated immediately. It is a pretty big restaurant with a large patio area where people are able to eat with their dogs. There was a decent sized crowd for a Saturday night. The menu is comparable to Cheesecake Factory where they literally have a little bit of everything, so many options it can be overwhelming. We started with drinks - pineapple mojito and sangria sampler. The sangria samplers was ~$9 and came with three little mason jars of peach sangria, raspberry sangria and Im not sure what the other one was, it just tasted like iced red wine to me. My favorite was the raspberry for sure. I took a sip of the mojito and it was pretty good. For food we ordered a Spicy Thai chicken salad, really good (but I have had it before) and a turkey burger. The fries seemed as if they were cooked earlier this afternoon, mushy and cold. Service was good after we had to wait 7 minutes to have our drink orders taken our server was on top of it from then out. The bill was around $50 which isn't too bad. If you sign up for their reward program you get a free appetizer / dessert. Also they have free wifi! Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for a late lunch with my girlfriend, this time we dined on the patio with our fur babies!! Service was awesome, Danny took really great care of us!!! And food was great like last time. Cannot wait to come back when the weather is a little cooler for the dogs."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here with my friends and our dogs. Amazing food and atmosphere. However, I am becoming increasingly irritated with the service. On several different visits the servers have failed to remove dirty dishes and glasses once we are done with them. We had a bowl of empty edamame sit on our table for 2 hours. It was not removed even after stacking all the dishes and pushing them to the end of the table. This is simply unacceptable and ruining the dining experience. I am in the service industry myself, and this would never be tolerated at my work. That being said, I love this place and will continue to come back. I hope this post catches managements eyes so that my next review will have all five stars."}
{"text":"Here for a second dinner, nachos were very good and fresh, the lazy dog ipa is a pretty good house ipa. If you like hoppy beers, try their flights of three ipas. Work a trip if you need a break from the strip and want good american fare"}
{"text":"The food (burgers) was great and perfectly timed. The Lazy Dog Pale Ale was tasty. Service was friendly but inattentive. He always seemed rushed. And we were sat at a lovely booth that was unfortunately next to a server station. We were privy to conversations and crowding that was just less than awesome. 
Overall, not bad. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is a must visit when in Summerlin, Las Vegas. The service was great. Our server was knowledgeable and able to help us pick some delicious plates. The trio hummus is totally worth every calorie and the butter cake was complete heaven (seriously). This is my favorite dessert. 
I would like to take my hat off to Phil the GM he has a awesome personality and totally makes guests feel at home.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Lazy Dog. I sat inside, vs sitting outside last time where I was too consumed with all the doggos to pay enough attention to the restaurants details. I loved the artwork in the menus, the atmosphere, and the flannels the staff wore. The food was good, especially the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake for dessert. There are two reasons this review isn't getting a full 5 stars. The first is just minor cleanliness. Where my boyfriend I were sitting, there was a division type wall between seating areas. It was pretty dang dusty. It was eye level, so kinda hard to ignore. The second reason for the lack of a 5th star was the pace of the staff. The manager came to our table three times. Once to ask how our food came out (normal manager duty), a second time to clear our plates, and a third to refill my boyfriends drink. The food runners and wait staff moved at a glacial speed; no sense of urgency in their steps. Everyone seemed friendly enough, but they've really gotta work on their hustle."}
{"text":"So good everything from scratch.  Loved the emami fries.  Wife the the carnitas, best I've had.  I would come back.  I asked if they could rush so we could catch our plane.  They exceeded all expectations.  Good job and thank u, candy."}
{"text":"I normally don't write a review as I expect the best from people in the industry. But I want to give a special recognition for Drea. She was awesome and took great care of us. If you're ever in the area, ask for her. She'll take good care of you!  Thank you Drea for the best service I've had since I moved to Vegas. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family! Keep up the great work and people are sure to come back for more."}
{"text":"I just wanted to share what a wonderful experience we had at Lazy Dogs tonight.  We went their for my son's birthday and at the end of the meal they offered him ice cream. I asked if they could check the container to see if it was cross contaminated, and it was.  However, the manager and chef came out and said they would create something special and safe for my son.  They returned with the most beautiful creation of butter cake topped with a brownie and strawberries that they assured us was completely nut free and not cross contaminated.  My son ate nearly the whole thing and had the biggest smile on his face.  We never eat dessert at restaurants because of food allergies but now we found our place to go.  We are so excited!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The wait has always been pretty long, but both times have been on a Saturday evening, so it should be expected. It is somewhat difficult to navigate through the narrow entryway in order to be seated or add your name to the wait list. The food was great both times! I have two teenage sons who can be hard to please, but we have always left full and happy with our food. The reason I gave 3 stars was the service. On both visits we've had less than attentive service. This second time my son ordered a strawberry citrus lemonade, still hadn't received it once our food came. We reminded the waitress who finally brought it more than halfway into dinner. I asked on 4 separate occasions for a water refill, not once did she come through with it. I finally gave up. I realize it's a Saturday night, and don't expect spot on service, but something a little more than what we've received would be nice! We do love that dogs are welcome outside and intend to give them another shot so we can bring the dog!"}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to bring my dog with me on my next visit. My server Alejandro, he was so amazing! I asked for a suggestion and he had such great insight into the dishes that I still had a hard time deciding what to order but his energy and attitude was what really made the difference. His smile is contagious!!!! Yes, the food was good but the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"So I originally wanted to give this place two stars but I will explain why it barely made the third star. First off I've only been here a couple times and within those times left a good enough mark on me to not want to go back or let it be my last option. So first time I went there was with my girlfriend and our dog. It took forever to get a glass of water and it took forever to order after the water. BUT WAIT.. No literally wait, because after the order was more waiting. I got so fed up that I was becoming uninterested with my food but it came. I tried their chipotle chicken quesadilla which I think is really overpriced which I can get better ones at Denny's for cheaper. And I got a side of French fries which I never got because they forgot and I wasn't about to wait longer because getting the check felt a lifetime. At least they didn't charge me for it. Second time I came with another couple plus my girlfriend and out dog again. Everyone got chicken Alfredo and one side of fries and I got the black and bleu pizza and Cajun fries. Yes I got my fries this time but the one guy who got the one side of regular fries didn't because they forgot. Saw that one coming. We got our table at 8. We wanted to eat and go get ice cream after but after all the waiting we didn't finish until 11. Trust me it was the same situation as my first visit. It was almost parallel to each other. BUT the reason and the only reason it barely made the third star is because their black and bleu pizza is absolutely amazing. I took it home and ate the leftovers the next day and it still tasted amazing. I don't know though if I would want to wait that long for a pizza. I guess it's nice also that I can bring my dog, but I'm better off ordering Dominos or Pizza Hut and relaxing with my girlfriend and dog at home."}
{"text":"We've anxiously been awaiting this opening for months, and wow was it ever worth it! Finally, a restaurant that is listening to customers and not focused only on profits. Everything is made from scratch, and it definitely tastes that way. We ordered the hummus plate, \"naked\" turkey burger, Thai chicken salad, and lime cheesecake. We really appreciated that we had the option to make changes such as \"hold the bacon,\" but no special requests were necessary, as there were literally hundreds of choices.

Service was engaging and prompt--our waitress was Krystie, and she knew her stuff.  The general manager also stopped by to check on our experience.  He genuinely cared that we were so happy.  Can't wait to return for brunch--soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and the server was great. Had a little problem in trying to get a reservation for that same day. The hostess told me that they don't do same day reservations. I push the issue with her and then she said, but we do a call in service, where you can put you name down for the time you want to show up and the group size. Is that not a reservation? So I can only give a 4 star due to the hostess getting a little hung up on company policy crap."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for the happy hour from 9-closing. Friends and I ordered almost every happy hour app and almost all of them were very good. The only one we didn't like we're the Cajun Fries and the chipotle ranch sauce on the side. Too much for us. But everything else was great and the house brews were very good as well. My personal favorites were the stouts, IPA, and lemon"}
{"text":"Food is a 3, service is a 4 and patio where we sat with our 2 dogs for lunch is a 5!  Tex mex salad was refreshing. The ahi salad was not great. Dogs ordered grilled chicken and rice and veggies. They ate chicken, left veggies."}
{"text":"Great food & service! Great brunch deals, with generous servings. Nice atmosphere as well. I really liked the Hawaiian fried rice with omelet."}
{"text":"What a great first time experience! My wife, son and I all loved it. I had the soup and 1/2 sandwich which was the bomb!! Had the chicken salad sandwich and  sausage mushroom soup! They were outstanding! My wife had the wok fired teriyaki chicken which she loved and Gunnar was really impressed with the hand breaded chicken fingers!! Definitely the best chicken fingers I've seen in a long time! We all have leftovers to take home too! Jennifer R. Was our server and she was very pleasant as well as helpful. Very glad we chose to have lunch here today and most importantly we have a new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"A bar for you and your lazy dog!

Located in Town Square, you can't miss their location on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd & Sunset.  The abundant seating area as well as pet friendly patio is certainly welcoming. We were greeted and seated immediately for an early lunch.  The service from Colleen was great.  She gave us some great recommendations as well as stellar service during our visit.   

The husband and I split the Chile Verde Chicken Nachos and the Pot Roast Beef Dip Sandwich.   This was definitely plenty of food for the both of us.  The winner between these two were the nachos.  The chips were fresh and warm topped with tomatillo chicken, black beans, cheese, jalapeños and tapatio crema sauce.  They were deliciously filling.  

Our beef dip sandwich however had too much horseradish. I felt like it was oozing out of the middle each time I took a bite.  It took away from the good beef flavor.  They should really put it on the side or at least lightly spread it.  I think they use a ladle for the horseradish.  Ugh.  But the cajun fries accompanying were good. I love the seasoning and generous amount.   

It wasn't the best first visit for a restaurant but I won't let it shy me away.  Their menu is large with plenty more to try."}
{"text":"Came here for my bfs bday! The happy hour menu was great and hey brought her a free dessert.. server was wonderful"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER. The blonde girl who took my drink order was so nice. I was unsure about what drink I wanted and she brought me a sample without me even asking. I really appreciated how considerate she was. The girl who waited on us the rest of our meal was okay. Awesome happy hour, good food at a great deal. I would recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the GF on a Saturday night to check it out.  She has been here before and I have not.  Just after the dinner rush, we were seated quickly.  With that being said, there was still a lot of bodies inside the joint.  Our little two person was on the fringe of the bar area and the main dining area.  A possible \"no man's land\" in other locations but not here.  

Our server was very attentive and patient as we checked out the menu. I enjoyed checking out the modern lodgey feel of the place. He rolled by multiple times and I never detected any attitude, even after the third time.  

After the fourth time, we were ready to order.  I had the \"Maggie's Snake River Salad.  Which I found to be very tasty.  It consisted of bacon, goat cheese, cranberries, tomatoes, walnuts and a balsamic vinaigrette.

The GF ordered up a lemon-capper chicken.  It was also delicious!

Together we ordered up some Cajun fries. The chipotle ranch dipping sauce was nice compliment.

Sure, there were tasty and healthy selections on the menu. I look forward to coming back again and getting down and dirty on a \"cheat\" day.

Hence the name...you can bring your four legged friend or family member and enjoy a special section of the menu outside with them!"}
{"text":"Bison Burgers on the menu led me to finally check out this restaurant at the corner of Town Square's restaurant pad.

Verdict: Beefy delicious! 
All Natural - 
Grass fed - 
Durham Ranch Farm -  great quality comes out of this farm

Appreciate it when someone knows what they are doing when it comes to making specialty meats. They made it perfect here. Texture and taste. Fresh toasted bun and their own version of bacon jam, I was one happy Shirley B! And for exceptional quality, it's surprisingly affordable at 11.95 that's including one side!

Restaurant is huge, lodge themed down to the servers in plaid or buffalo checked shirts.. NOTE TO SELF: don't wear my plaid shirt again here so customers won't keep flagging for me in the bar area.. lol

Patio dining area is dog friendly. So you people who are easily annoyed keep that in mind if you want to dine out there. There's even a waiver you have to sign saying you acknowledge this and withhold restaurant and dog owners not responsible for your dining experience.

Service was good. Everyone was friendly. Got seated right away, server was attentive, orders got to us promptly, but the busier the restaurant got, the less we saw our server. She didn't touch our table for another 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes to get our check. Other than that minor hiccup, everything went smoothly. 

So returning soon to try their Bison Meatloaf dinner!"}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie was amazing and we had an amazing server!! Her name is Ronnie and she took great care of us!! Thank you Ronnie!!"}
{"text":"Cool little joint in town with that Cali feel. Main reason why is the staff, I had a bartender named Andrea, she is awesome and spunky. Does a great job taking care of the entire bar, cute as a button. Will continue to go, hopefully the rest of the bar staff holds the same standard hospitality. Drinks and Food Reasonably prices and nice to see some freshness of the menu for a chain."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Especially from our server Jimmy! Definitely will be going back for more good times!"}
{"text":"The condiment cups are way too small and shallow, I ordered the fries which were very good but you could only dip a 1/4 of an inch of the fry and it's definitely not enough for the whole bag of fries. I also ordered the chicken quesadilla which was great but again the salsa was not enough and when the waiter finally brought me more I was already done with my quesadilla"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour.  Local brewery offerings on tap, creative cocktails, variety of appetizers.  John is a stand-out bartender:  welcoming, knowledgeable on local brew craft scene.  Atmosphere is very open; bar seating has view of outdoor serving area with fire pit and restaurant. We also ate in the restaurant.  Menu had nice spectrum of Gastro-pub items (brussel sprouts, Kimchee fried rice) to traditional meat dishes.  Good place for date.  The place seems to have caught on with the locals since it opened about a year ago."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a definitely awesome service. 5 star for presentation of the food. I gave a 3 star because of the taste of the food. I order the soy salmon and it was very salty. My wife order the Hawaiian ribs that was pretty good but not great. Kids teriyaki chicken was not good. I can't say if I would be back again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT LAZY DOG ! We had dinner last nite Saturday at this place. Horrible experience ! We invited out of town friends here, We are embarrassed . All though was very empty took some time to get assistance. Ordered BBQ ribs,...watch out , these ribs are NOT BBQed  they are deep fried ! Eeek ! dry and flavorless. maybe delicious for lazy stray dogs !!! never seen deep fried ribs....disaster of a product !! We sent them back, and i never send food back ! just imagine ......
Furthermore, they came in a aluminum plate. I thought maybe they got their plates from PETCO or some PRISON ! I got it its called the LazyDog but come on now, we don't have to eat like dogs, as a matter of a fact even my maltese eats in china porcelain plate with daisies on it  The Restaurant theme is a FAILURE of a concept !!"}
{"text":"We into Lazy Dog's to watch the hockey game and had a great time!  We didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Our server Sergio, did a great job recommending the hummus as a starter, and was spot on us getting a pitcher of sangria. On point service,we definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Best service even when they are busy at the bar in downtown summerlin. ..Wendy thank you your the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend take our dog Pablo to lazy dog every couple months, the first time we went.. he won cutest dog award and they gave us a free dog meal next time we go :p

The quality of the food is very very good, the service is friendly and fast. We eat on the balcony every time and always enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"This was my sixth or so time here.  Usually food was pretty good and service was adequate. This last time, however, was horrific enough to say I will never go again!  Ordered a burger medium-cooked. It came so bloody the bun was soaked red.  The waiter never came by to ask how it was. Another waitress stopped by and told our waiter to come over. He finally came over and took our burgers back. About 15 minutes later, we got new burgers but this time they were so well done they were dark brown all through. Again, the waiter never came by to ask how everything was. They were completely tasteless and dry. Never did see the waiter again. We finally asked a different waiter to get us our check, which he did. Paid for the burgers and needless to say, didn't leave a tip   I blame the manager. He needs to train his waitstaff and cooks to do their jobs."}
{"text":"I love this patio.  There is a great happy hour, great choices for food and drinks and our dog loves coming here!  This was our first time on a Friday and it was busier than usual.  We sat down about 10 minutes before hh ended and was surprised that no one came over for a full 15 mins.  Usually we are greeted immediately and receive quick and excellent service.  Today our server was James and he was disappointing.  We ordered a happy hour margarita pizza and he charged us for a full size.  My husband let it go because he was pretty hungry and was going to eat it anyways  but when he ordered a second beer before our mains came he waited 30 mins and we had to call James over and ask where it was.  He did not apologize for the 30 min wait just said he was just about to check on it.  The sun had set and he no longer want the beer, so he sent it back.  It was given to him anyways and taken off the check, but it was the wrong beer anyways lol.  Not great, James!"}
{"text":"Service was good throughout the meal.

Food was excellent, great spinach dip for appetizer and 2 good burgers, the wife's was not done well enough at first so they had to send it back to the kitchen.  Server returned with it properly done as well as a coupon from the manager for a free desert or appetizer on our next visit to make up for it so all good there.

Drinks were not mixed well by bartender but that's really the biggest complaint.  4 out of 5."}
{"text":"First time here and wanted to try it out - Went around lunch time - Walked in and the atmosphere was different in a good way - Was greeted right away - Customer service great and friendly - For starters we had the recommendation of getting the chicken quesadilla - Very yummy - Like'd how the quesadilla outter crust was crispy with cheese - Could of used a little bit more spice - It did say chipotle chicken quesadilla. Did go around lunch time so I had a cobb salad - I was expecting a little bit more of a presentation: It was all shredded lettuce, little bits of bacon, tiny egg and chicken.  A little disappointed in the salad. My boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki bowl.  His dish was really great. Had lots of flavor.  Next time I'll try some different rather than their salad. First time, wasn't a success but I'll come back again to get different experience in food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bahama chicken. It was about a 4/10. I feel like it lacked the flavor that seems promising on the menu. Tasted like grilled chicken and rice with some teriyaki sauce on the side. Chicken was tender but it needs more flavor. 

My husband ordered the lunch special Blackened chicken bowl. Same thing.. Lacking in flavor. I like the ambiance and the $5 bloody Mary's. Service was good so that's disappointing. Wish this food was Better for the price we have paid. I think the food we've had at Chili's is better."}
{"text":"While being a little reserved about the name... we ventured in. The atmosphere was very nice, staff right there; Hello and welcome to Lazy Dog!

After being seated and granddaughter settled in, we looked over the menu to 2 items: Lamb Ragu and Buffalo Meatloaf... wha.....?

A pizza off the kids menu was as big as our 2year old granddaughter, we were ready... so we thought.

There is no way to describe these 2 dishes other than \"stupid good\" Seriously! The lamb was shredded and cooked perfectly along, with exceptional pasta. The Buffalo meatloaf was delicious with mashed potatoes, sautéed spinach and a perfect gravy.

These are seasonal items but approximately $16-17 each and well worth every penny!! A must for the foodie!!"}
{"text":"As we were on the way to Lazy Dog's again a 2nd time with some family members in tow, glowing about our first visit.... we walked in, greeted warmly, and seated. Nice.

Starter of Hush puppies, Humus Trio, and Cajun fries.... Yum!! 

My meal this time Lamb Shank with mashed potatoes and a simple sauteed spinach... outstanding!

From here is just started to unravel from there. Son-in-law ordered the Buffalo Meatloaf... 45 mins later the manager is at our table telling us they are out. What!? My wife's meal tasted like it was marinated in vinegar for the day and then served. Pow! Wham! as you try to recover from our body shaking in revolt.

My Daughters Club was amateur at best and a complete disaster!

Now to get to the end of this rather disheartening evening... for the 3rd time the Manager Brooks shows up with me sitting at the table alone. \"I am so sorry for this evening\". she says, I responded, it just went south after the announcement of we are out of Buffalo meatloaf... Brooks agreed. I asked what I owed, without hesitation she responds, \"it is on the house with a deepest apologizes\". We were there for 1 1/2 hours with very little going right after starters, my meal was the exception.

I have to tell you, as I told Brooks, this is the only reason I would return and it is also the reason I gave a 5 star review. Period.

Thank you to a great Manager: Brooks. You are a gem among the stones out there in the world of Managers.

I am grateful."}
{"text":"The service is great. Because it was our 1st visit the mgr brought us a flat bread pizza. It was tasty. My chipotle chicken was ok. I expected more flavor. My husband said the black and blue burger was awesome. My coconut water was delicious. We will come back and bring the fur kids"}
{"text":"I normally would rate Lazy Dog 5-STAR, up until an incident today.

We frequent your establishment located in Downtown Summerlin, Las Vegas on a regular basis, dining at least four to five times a month with friends and family, and have always been pleased with the food and service.   We raved about your restaurant and your food to many of our neighbors and community associations.

However, I must relay to you an incident that occurred today, September 30, 2017.   It had us questioning whether or not we want to subject ourselves to the rude and obnoxious behavior we encountered today from one of your employee. The employee in question is the hostess, Brenda.

We always arrive early when your restaurant open in the morning on weekend, so we get a table in one of the far corners of restaurant. The reason being we have a large-senior-service dog and like to isolate him so no other patrons are bothered by his presence.

Today, being the first party to arrive, we politely requested to be seated in one of the far corner table.  We were rudely told by Brenda that those section were closed and we had to sit in the middle of the restaurant.  After seating us she snidely said, \"Do you have a leash for that dog!\"

Two minutes later another couple arrived, and the same Brenda who informed us that the corner section was closed to us, seated the couple at the table we had requested minutes earlier. 

To make matters worse the table that Brenda assigned us, was in direct sunlight, with no shade, and since my wife is sensitive to sunlight she was extremely uncomfortable.  To top it off, Brenda processes to squeeze two parties of families with children, each on both sides of us, virtually boxing us in, and making our dog anxious and apprehensive.

Needless to say this was quite an unpleasant experience that resulted in our loss of appetite and a half-eaten meal.

My wife took our dog and walked out of the patio to go back to our vehicle.  It left her aggravated and with upset stomach.  She went to speak to the Supervisor/Manager, Christy.  My wife pointed out and informed the entire incident to Christy, and the extremely uncomfortable surroundings, as well as the rudeness and snotty attitude of the hostess named Brenda.  

Once again, we are regular-satisfied patrons of Lazy Dog Restaurant, but this incident today is unusually disturbing, upsetting and extremely disappointing.

We hope to see that this incident does not happen again.  When a customer is politely and respectfully requesting a particular seat, the least for a \"representative\" or hostess of an establishment should do is respond back politely and respectfully, no matter the accommodation."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite restaurant!!! This place is amazing, I've been here multiple times, with and without my dog. The outside patio is nice and big and has a pretty fireplace right in the middle. The inside is beautiful, love the cabin feel. The menu has SO many different options, it's so hard to choose. Their happy hour is awesome too, and their special brunch menu is worth a Sunday morning trip. Highly recommend the green chile mac and cheese! Best thing I have ever tasted. Planning on going back this weekend already."}
{"text":"Eh, just okay.  Nothing worth being a frequent guest for.  Came in at Noon on a Wednesday.  Sat at the bar.  Bartender (Melissa) was nice but seemed more concerned about getting the bar set up than she did about how I was doing.  I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  It was not a very good salad.  Though the ingredients were very fresh the flavors were very overpowering to the tuna.  There was no sense of complimentary flavors.   I tasted either greens, or olive or tuna or a very strong dressing.  Melissa never asked me how my food was or offered another beverage.  Disappointing.  I like good service.  This was not good service."}
{"text":"We have never had one bad meal here! All staff is great! Especially Lisa! Great happy hour and great brunch!"}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER!!! Bullshit they tried to make me eat. The manager Kristy Portillo made the call that I had to order food before she would serve me any drinks. Wish I could give negative stars . She must be a democrat what a loser."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you can find all sorts of different menu items for every taste. My favorite thing is their small plate of sweet potato tater tots. The dipping sauce that comes with it is amazing. So delicious. I always order a pizza or a hamburger. Both are okay, for my taste. My husband, however, really enjoys their pizza crust. His favorite menu item is the sticky ribs. They are good, Im just not much of a rib person. I've tried them, though and they taste a little sweet to me, which is interesting. The food is good. The wait to receive your food after you order is always long, which is an inconvenience to me because I have kids and they get restless after a while.

I added an extra star from my original post because I remember that every time I come here, the manager or someone in charge always ask how everything was. That's a nice touch I appreciate."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside on the patio with all the fur baby's but OMG REALLY PEOPLE they belong on the floor not eating from your plate!!! The gluten free menu is okay the stir fry is never the same"}
{"text":"The food here SUCKS... Save yourself some time and money, go somewhere else. Two stars for the waiter he was awesome. Stale fries flavorless burger, teriyaki chicken taste like straight soy sauce. And I don't know how anyone can ruin mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a buddy. A warm day (about 95° in the sun). We chose to sit out on the patio. Shaded so about 10° cooler and very comfy. Decided to behave myself and get the ahi tuna salad - only 330 calories!! And totally delish and very filling. Only problem Came in with Yelp check in. Those evil folks sabotaged me by giving me a side of Cajon fries with my Yelp check-in. Once again the diet went to hell, but those fries were worth it. Yumm! The only real negative was that a couple of the dogs on the patio or less than well behaved. Barking at the Great Dane that was  resting at a table  near us. I know. I know. This is Lazy Dog restaurant. They cater to folks who want to bring the dog to dine with them on the patio. But a Great Dane??!! I just wish that they could keep the smaller dogs a little better behaved when they're dining with strangers."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends and I would absolutely go back except the service was terribly slow. Granted it was a Monday night during football season. However I had to ask the waiter where my food was. She seemed so busy she forgot about us. Once I did get my food it was great! I ordered The Dirty Dog. It was messy but full of flavor and had a small kick to it from the buffalo sauce. Their portion size vs. price was right on point. Better service would make this place 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a quick dinner before heading to the strip because the restaurant was close to a condo we were staying at. The restaurant was pretty crowded because of the dinner rush. We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting. 

Our table shared Cajun Fries and a Brick Oven Spinach & Sundried Tomato Cheese Dip for starters. The dip was too salty for me. The fries were okay. 

I chose to share a chicken pot pie and a Tex-Mex salad with my friend since we wanted both things. The chicken pot pie was huge, but it only had a crust on top. It was basically the easier way to make a pot pie. The pot pie also had huge chunks of chicken which I didn't enjoy because that's basically all you would eat in one bite. The Tex-Mex salad was good and very big. Next time I would probably do without the black beans since I'm not a fan of them. The dressing was a nice accompaniment too. 

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with all the questions we had. Overall, we had a decent meal here."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service ruined it. We had the pesto chicken salad and spicy Thai chicken salad. We also had the mashed potato hush puppies. They're great!  Lazy Dog gets two stars because of the service."}
{"text":"My second time eating here. I Had shrimp tacos with black beans and brown rice for lunch with ice tea- lunch was $13. A great value, excellent food and terrific service. Bar tender who serve me was friendly, professional and I was in and out in less than 30 min eating at bar. On a scale of 1-10 the place was an 11! Love it."}
{"text":"Brought my dog here with my girlfriend stacey - she can be soo loud sometimes but she was great and didn't bark once! They brought water over almost immediately and were very attentive to not touching her and smiling and being kind. Our server Sean was on his double of a double shift - and was really kind about his exhaustion since we sat on the patio on a 110+ degree day. Lazy Dogs we will be making this a monthly tradition,wonderful business model with great service and food. The chicken verse nachos rocked. Had the peaches and moonshine too - make sure to wear your seat belt =)"}
{"text":"I only gave it a star because I had to in order to post. This was arguably the worst service I ever had in a dining establishment. The food was \"eh\", but it was the best part of our visit. We only saw our waiter when he took our drink order and not again until we had to have someone \"fetch him\" (pun intended) to bring our check. Then we had to find him again to pick it up. We're locals and the place looked promising. It wasn't.  Maybe it was just the waiter we had, but it ruined the place for us. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious and servings are worth the price. Customer service is on point. Very friendly and efficient. Didn't wait long for our food. Our meal was excellent and presented well. We were being attended promptly by our server. We didn't have to wait. Every thing came to our table smoothly. From the water, to our drinks, serving us our appetizers to our main meal and lastly our dessert. We didn't have to wait for anything. Our server was prompt and very attentive to our needs. Excellent customer service. Haven't had this kind of service in a very long time when we dine out. I am surely going to come back here  if I want a very good dinner and relaxing evening to enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all, I have to say the hostess or whatever you call her in the front was kind of rude. Her attitude kind of made me NOT want to stay and eat here but I had a dog with me, so I  had no choice being that there are no other dog friendly restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. I literally just asked some simple questions like if I was allowed to eat inside with the dog and she replied to me like I was dumb, because I \"obviously\" wasn't allowed to (insert eye roll here). Once we sat down, the menu just looked ordinary, nothing too special. They have lunch specials everyday though! I opted for the chicken parm - it was not that good. They also have a doggy menu which I thought was really cool. We got our dog the hamburger with brown rice - not going to lie but I thought it looked better than my food haha Oh! and we also didn't know that dogs weren't allowed in our laps when we were sitting at the table - the hostess (another one that shows you where your seat is, not sure if she was a hostess though) scolded us (insert other eye roll here). Foodwise, we had also gotten the spinach dip - all cheese no spinach honestly. The food is not good here AND I felt the staff was somewhat rude. Needless to say, NOT coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Amazing bartender and service. I think his name was Roy. He made sure we were very well take care of. Very professional. We will be back of him!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for my dog and I to go to great happy hours fabulous food excellent service and the one on Las Vegas Boulevard amazing sunsets Watching Airplanes"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend I haven't seen while here. Before eating here I looked up the place. I mentioned to her that she can bring her dog if she wants and the menu seemed to offer a good variety of food. She ordered a sandwich off their lunch menu and I ordered the fried chicken.

Chicken was good but it's more like chicken fried steak. I was expecting traditional fried chicken. Still it was a delicious meal so not a big deal, though I'm sure future patrons who are pickier will point that out. 

I also had the jamaican lemonade? It was very tart. It probably could use more sugar, or less lemonade. 

I would come again here if I'm at Summerlin side of town. Would like to try the rest of the menu. Price is very good as well."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night with the family and boyfriend and we were taken care of by Miles. By far the nicest server I've ever had at this location. He was super attentive and would strike up casual conversations. He noticed I didn't like my vegetables and immediately offered a substitute, that was really sweet of him. All in all, had a really great dinner and would definitely come back for the food and service!  btw the Poke appetizer is to die for!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice staff. Quick seating. Dog friendly patio. Easy parking. Steak salad was exceptional. Ahi was good but not great. Loud if you are into that. Big bar. Lots of liquor options"}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times now.  Food is awful. Even the nachos were bad... How do you ruin nachos??"}
{"text":"Great burger. Great chicken nachos. Cold beer. Can't ask for anything else after a day at Red Rock Canyon. 

If you have a dog, it can sit with you on the patio. 

Ample parking."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Wanted to like it since it has a dog-friendly, somewhat heated patio. Dog meals are $5 and tasted better than the people food we ordered. The poke is NOT is not authentic nor good poke. Bland everything. Fries straight outta the freezer, no seasoning at all. Service was SLOW, maybe because we were out on the patio they forgot us? My date mentioned perhaps the downfall is that the menu is too varied: pick a direction and do it well instead!!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and that dogs are allowed on the patio. Had very good service. The only thing I didn't like is that the Alfrado sauce. It really doesn't taste the way it should but we will be back to try another dish. :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. I was a little nervous because they had such a huge menu, those places usually aren't very good to me. But what I ordered was awesome. And I tried some of our other dishes we ordered. All we fantastic. Great service. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I  came to Lazy Dog to eat  11/21/17 around 8pm my server was Ronnie she gave great service great suggestive on buffalo cauliflower and calamari and for our meal it was beef dip with tater tots all her suggestions and the food was great service was greater for out dessert she suggested huckleberry pie ..But you all run out for the night so she suggested pumkin chez cake..The only problem was she has a lot of tables with no one helping her we felt so bad for her we watched her almost two hours getting set back to back and we seen other employees and two other managers on floor no one ever attempted to help her..she was not even walking to the tables she was literally running around trying to stay caught up..It just surprise how their was no one to help her or even  her manager to say hold up let her get caught up..Or let me help her take order get drinks nothing..I  think food was great service also..But very bad management skills . Unfair situation..if I was her I would have broke down and run out"}
{"text":"Alejandro was our waiter and he just made our night! He gave great recommendations on our meal and to top it off serenaded us throughout- our party of six loved the great food and had a great time with Alejandro! Loved the Lazy Dog!!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was so delightful. The food was hot and flavorful . I would recommend there burgers they are juicy and so good also there fish tacos were so yummy . Our server Kem was so nice always refilling our waters and asking us for any prombelm a . I would totally recommend this to anyone !!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the lazy dog restaurant at Summerlin for the first time tonight I was very very pleased with the food and the service is also excellent. Space I had a great hamburger that was cooked perfectly Cajun fries there were too much for two people to eat.  The service was excellent and I even had a personal visit from the assistant general manager welcoming me to the restaurant.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog. You were pretty good. Not bad. Not fantastic. Above average...meh. Maybe.

THE STAFF:  We got there and the hostess was great. Really friendly and helpful. She even made sure to let us know in this busy night that the seating at the bar area was first come first served in case we didn't want to wait.  The person who delivered our food was also super nice. Unfortunately, there was a chatty waitress who would not stop talking with us. She kept telling long stories to the point of things getting awkward. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind the quick joke or chat with the wait staff, but when my girlfriend and I are both taking bites out of our burgers, it's time to hit the road. Very weird staring at you while chewing.  Keep the anecdotes under 2 minutes, please.

There was also a hostess who wasn't so friendly.  Just an attitude that really made you feel like she didn't care at all. It also seemed awkward for nobody to say \"bye\", or \"come again\", or \"thanks for choosing Lazy Dog\" when there were like 7 employees that you had to walk by to leave. 

THE FOOD:  Food was really good. Not 5-star good, but I'd say a four. I was a bit upset that they were out of 9 of like 25 draft beers.  Not sure why that was the case.  

We had the loaded potato hush puppies. Really good. I'd say a 4 of 5. Mac n cheese. 5 of 5. Definitely good.  My blue cheese burger was solid. 4 of 5. Girlfriends pasta was, I thought, 3 of 5. But I'm also picky about pasta.

Overall, it was a good experience.  And the food was good. Not spectacular, but definitely good."}
{"text":"I like the Lazy Dog.  This place has really great service and the food is really good.  I got the lunch specials when we were there so it was a great combo.  Great atmosphere, not too loud and it is dog-friendly out on the patio.  There can be a lot of dogs and sometimes there are dogs who don't like other dogs so just be cautious.  Fun and cool place to hang out, eat, and enjoy company."}
{"text":"Dog friendly! Great brunch! Awesome staff! A definite go-to for a all around great experience! Ask for Kim for your server!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at this location. The food was amazing, so many good choices. Our waiter J Lo was very attentive and went the extra mile making my experience that much better!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was great. It has a great interior. The staff was nice and the food was really good. We got lots of food for a pretty low price for happy hour. Our tabs were low. I will come back to this place soon. I found another favorite place to eat... This place"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.We were here for a coworkers birthday dinner.It was kinda empty the decor was nice I loved the patio more than anything,but since the patio caters to furbabies our party didn't wanna sit outside due to the fact that we might get loud and startle the animals.Yes this restaurant caters to dogs.They even have a dog menu.Anywho we were seated in the back by the fireplace it was nice and cozy.The service was good considering we were a huge party.I ordered a cucumber martini it was okay very small for 8+ dollars.For dinner I had the shrimp Alfredo it was very good and surprisingly the shrimp were very large and it was a lot in the pasta.The flat bread that came with the meal was amazing.It was like a cheese and some kind of herb flat bread.I wish I had just ordered the bread and had that All night.The portion size was medium I mean I was able to finish the whole thing so I'm not sure if I was hungry or if the portion size was small.Umm I was upset because I never got to order another type of drunk because the waitress never came back and asked.But it was ok.I will probably come back but it's definitely not something that I would run home to tell my mom about.The most exciting part was that you can bring you furbabies...But Enjoy."}
{"text":"Super slow take out - twice - and indifferent staff - but a good bartender.

The atmosphere and decor is nice. The bartender, Brandon, was a pro. I'd say go there for a drink for sure. Go sit down if you want super salty TGI Friday's type food. But don't do pick up/take out.

But...

I've ordered food for 'pick up' there twice. The first time I felt like the service was just ok. The staff seemed kind of indifferent about helping me, and they were slow. The food took a long time, too - over 20 min the first time. 

The second time was MUCH worse - almost 40 min to get my food and 10 minutes before that to wait for the only person who can take an order for pick up. Even though there were 4 other people roaming around the hostess area, only one can take your order and they would not let me just order it at the bar, which was 100% empty. 

The worst thing is not the wait - that is bad, but, you know, sometimes things go wrong. The worst thing was that when I finally had to go ask the (manager?) about my order and tell her it was over 35 minutes since I ordered it, she seemed annoyed by me. She did not apologize, or seem concerned at all. She didn't ask if there was anything she could do - could she offer me a coupon for 10% off next time? Nothing. 

When I asked her why it took almost 40 min when I was told it would \"for sure be under 20 minutes\" she said that there were a couple of large take out orders that cam in right before mine. The restaurant, in general, was not busy at all. And, let's be honest. If they took 40 min to serve guests sitting at tables, no one would ever come back. So I guess it is just the take out side that is the problem. Either way, the food is not good enough to make me go back despite this kind of poor service."}
{"text":"Great food, great menu, great atmosphere. Our server Ashely was stellar. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came in here with my pupp and was in love. Our server was so nice wish I remembered her name but she was super nice and very nice to the puppy which is a plus haha. Also the food here is yummy can't complain. Perfect atmosphere and their patio is very spacious and heated for the cold weather."}
{"text":"3 of us went here for an early dinner.  There were 3 hostess's working and talking but we were ignored.  They were trying to seat one other table but i'm not sure why it took all 3.  

Our server was slow and only checked on us once when we were almost done with our meals.  The food was just average and nothing great.   

Fyi, if you are going for happy hour it is only in the bar or outside.  

Overall, nothing special about this visit.  Service was poor and food was average."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in person yet so this is solely a to go order review. My first complaint was the loaded potatoes being premade, as I'm a vegetarian & I prefer fresh food. Anyways, the grilled cheese was really good and the fries were crispy even to go. The Caesar salad was huge with what looked like homemade crutons, yum! I can't wait to try this place in person."}
{"text":"My dog Waffle's favorite restaurant, he loves the grilled chicken. When bringing your pet you have to be seated on the outdoor patio. The human food is always fresh and delicious, and the staff is always friendly and polite.

My favorite is the white chocolate brownie served warm with vanilla ice cream topped with hot fudge. We have been there many times and never had a bad experience.

It's so much fun to take your loving baby out to eat at a restaurant that truly wants them there. We will be back or my dog will be bummed"}
{"text":"The food was good but service was horrible! Took forever to take our order. Then waited a long time for our check, to go boxes and drink refill. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Two words, BUTTER CAKE. Best Butter Cake in Las Vegas. Yes I've eaten butter cake at Mastro's and this place is far better. The rib eye is pretty amazing as well. Service was great."}
{"text":"We dined here last night but also come here weekly for a family meal with our dog on the covered patio.  Lazy Dog is a favorite for us.

This is the best restaurant of with wait service tableside that allows dogs. We consistently get great service and are never disappointed with the food quality.

When you're seated, alongside the people menus they also include a dog menu. you can choose from a hamburger patty or grilled chicken over brown or white rice. Each dog gets their own complimentary bowl of water. We have ordered both the hamburger patty and grilled chicken with brown rice. Buddy the dog seems to like both alot as he can finish his food here in 60 seconds flat. 

As for the people food...  They redesigned their menu a few months ago, and since then the quality of the food has been excellent. It seems they prep most of their recipes from scratch at the location and you can tell the difference with the freshness of the vegetables and subtle tastes like garlic and citrus zest.

As a vegetarian, I order the Tofu Coconut Curry bowl.  It is REALLY good.  The tofu is breaded and cooked perfectly. Flavors are excellent. And all for 9.75, you can't go wrong for what you get.  I highly recommend it.

For dessert, many times we can't turn down the Butter Cake. It's served warm with cold vanilla ice cream and berries... it is delicious!! Get it when you go."}
{"text":"Scratch food and good service! They make their own beer, and despite their very diverse menu, everything is the same quality, which is awesome. Try their Pad Thai or some appetizers!"}
{"text":"Why am I giving them a five star? Plain and simple, they accommodate for our four legged babies which for me is fabulous. I haven't brought my fur babies here but I just love that they provide service for them as well.

Food was okay, service was okay too. There was something missing and I don't know what it is. Maybe I should pay them a visit again to see if things have changed."}
{"text":"A friend and I checked this place out mainly in hopes of finding a tasty burg (we did), but it turns out Lazy Dog has more to offer. We were seated within a few minutes despite the restaurant being busy, and the service stayed on top of everything well throughout the meal. Ordered the Greens, Egg + Ham as a starter, then the Baja California burger; definitely made for a great dinner after being impaled by a giant sword."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant. The service was so great (Thank You Miles).

Great food and a great atmosphere. I would go again and again."}
{"text":"Very cool, laid back restaurant/bar!  Great menu with something for every palate.  Even the low cal choices don't skimp on flavor, the ahi tuna on cauliflower mashies w/ coconut curry cream sauce is awesome.  The happy hour is really good, too.  The bartender, Kevin, was fun!  He made us a very tasty sangria and served it up with a smile!  Great food and service, can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset with the food and drinks, but my service was decent. The pitcher of peach sangria was super watered down with carbonated water, and the sandwich is got was incredibly dry. Fries were my favorite part and the biscuit from my friend's meal was delicious. Really sad I spent $30 here today."}
{"text":"I had lunch at lazy dog today.  Lisa was my server.  If I could give more stars I would. My experience was wonderful beause of her.  The chicken salad sandwich is so good...BUT don't leave without trying the butter cake.  You will think you have gone to heaven!"}
{"text":"+1 huge, killer patio for al fresco dining!
+1 it's dog friendly AND the staff is friendly
+1 early and late HH (M-F 3-6, another one starts at 9 certain days)

I have a confession. I am a cat person! I love dogs, too. I just don't own one. YET. I kind of avoided this place at first because I thought it would be packed with canines and their owners, but other than a bunch of dog-theme décor (check out the fire hydrant draft beer spouts!), I didn't see much of the furry critters.*

Menu is a smorgasbord of apps, Asian dishes, pizzas, classic American dishes, and some soups, salads, and sandwiches too. In other words, you may have a hard time deciding. The VEGGIE LAVASH SANDWICH is indulgent but healthy (650 calories but packed with fresh veggies). I especially liked the thick-cut Gouda and sundried tomato hummus! Upgraded side of Cajun fries with spicy ranch dipping sauce is worth the $1 surcharge, even if they invalidate your healthy entrée decision.  The CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP is hearty, and the RED POMEGRANATE SANGRIA ($4/HH) is also fair, but not must-get dishes.

{"text":"Went to eat with friends from work to celebrate Christmas.  Our server Paula was super friendly and  provided great service. The manager Kristen Bonkavich came to the table to welcome us and made us feel right at home. The food and service was top notch.  I will definitely recommend Lazy Dogs to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Online order placed at 630pm.  Requested pickup time 722pm.  Arrived and no trace of the order in their system.  Friendly server called over the manager/partner and he assisted.  He explained difficulties they were having with their ordering system and owned that the order probably went through but got dropped somewhere in their system.  

Reason for the 5 stars the food was tasty once I got it and the manager, with out me asking, issued a 30% discount on the order and gave me a delicious beer while I waited.  Service done right and because of that I will be back dispite the inconvenience of having to wait for the order."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to my first visit to Lazy Dog from the first time I heard they were coming to Downtown Summerlin. I visited on Easter Sunday & I was pleasantly surprised there wasn't a line!  I quickly got a table & was greeted by the most friendly & hospitable hostess & server. The cocktails were fresh & tasty. I am still undecided about the food. We ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer & I loved it. It was fresh & was very good. Since it was brunch I ordered Chilaquiles. It looked like it had sat for a while since it was dry & had very little eggs, sauce or cheese to be found. I ordered a burger to replace it & it arrived cold & a little underdone. I will be back to try something else but this place may be better for cocktails & appetizers."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people and was feeling pretty ambivalent about Lazy Dog as a whole; I'd only gone to their location in Summerlin and was never a big fan of it. Somehow, despite having the same menu, the food at the Town Square location tasted significantly better. I guess I wasn't the only one to think so, because the place was PACKED with a bunch of businessmen and women grabbing lunch. I've been to the other location a handful of times and had never seen it even half as busy as Town Square was. Even with the crowds, though, we didn't have to wait and the staff was doing a great job getting food out and people seated. 

My party had fish tacos and fish and chips and burgers, and I had the grilled chicken, and everyone LOVED their food. Oddly, though mine was the least complicated of the group, it took about 5-10 minutes longer to cook than everyone else's. I honestly didn't think it was a big deal, but they went above and beyond to make up for the delay. The food was really delicious and with how totally lovely and kind they were about the delay, I totally recommend this location."}
{"text":"Let's just start with this:
I can take my dogs to lunch. Awesome!!!!!!
Food is very good and very reasonably priced. Same with cocktails/beer/wine. Our server, Ty, was great. It's busy, so chill and relax with the dogs!"}
{"text":"Don't waste you time or money. Slow service for a Wednesday night. Fish and chips were horrible. Very greasy. Chips were old and cold. Was very clean. And cute decor. First and last time there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Mother's Brunch here. Very comfortable for us to have a family brunch and include the pups. Brunch menu is also very affordable priced and everything we ordered was good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and never been that wowed by the food; it's okay but not great.The food has always come off as plain. I come with a particular group of friends because it's just convenient for all of us to get together there, but no one really seems all that crazy about it, to be honest. It has never been really busy any time I've visited, and there's plenty of seating inside. I think you can even eat with your dog on their outdoor patio, which is a nice perk. They offer a lot of food for special diets, and I usually get a burger sans bun because it's gluten free, but it doesn't really taste any different than something from a chain like Red Robin. 

I found myself at their other location in Town Square recently, and their food seemed way better. My party there REALLY enjoyed their food. It seems strange that two parts of the same chain would have such a dramatically different flavor, but I guess it all comes down to the talent of the kitchen staff. I've never had an awful experience here, but I would prefer Town Square."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the ambiance is warm and welcoming. It is particularly cool that people can bring their dogs to the patio area.
I like going here to watch sporting events while having a beer and trying out their many yummy appetizers at the bar. Particularly like the hummus trio.

Bartenders Adam, Kris and Teri are particularly awesome but don't want to take away from the fact that the service has been great every time I have gone."}
{"text":"The good: amazing food, amazing drinks, amazing prices, amazing atmosphere. 

Unfortunately we probably won't be back here for a while because of the bad. Service needs to get fixed. We've been here twice in the last couple weeks because we enjoyed the happy hour, however service has been HORRENDOUS it has taken at least 10-12 minutes each time for our server to greet us, and on top of that another 10-15 minutes to even get the drinks we ordered. Our food has come before our drinks were delivered which was very frustrating, and each time they were delivered, it was by someone else (each one very friendly) but our server was nowhere to be found. We were ready to go and waited for the check for a good 20 minutes. We saw her doing side work putting place settings down with out ever checking on us. Eventually we had to get up and ask for it.

This restaurant has all of the parts but the service which is the Biggest part because our experiences were both completely ruined, the servers name was marien. 

I'd recommend the bar or restaurant area rather than running the risk of getting her"}
{"text":"This was our 4th time here and have never been disappointed. We've tried several items on the menu and everything is delicious. 
This time we ordered a steak and it came out a little bit under cooked but we didn't complain. The waiter saw we hadn't ate most of it and asked if she could replace and we said it was fine. She still sent her manager and he ended up taking the item off the bill without us asking him to do that. 
Great service from everyone there."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly service. And I can bring my dog! As long as we eat out on the patio. A little pricey but other than that, thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came in about a month ago with my boyfriend and our dog Maverick! We are thrilled to have a restaurant that will allow our dogs to come along too! We came on a very windy Friday night and I was skeptical about sitting outside but I had my dog so we had to. When we stepped onto the patio it was AMAZING! There were these cool plastic coverings along the entire patio and a huge fire pit in the center of the patio. After being sat at a table near the edge of the patio we decided to move directly in front of the fire pit to eat our entrees. We instantly fell in love with this restaurant. Our server Marina came right out to take our drink and appetizer order. She was completely helpful the entire time. I had the fish tacos but they lacked flavor. They were fried and I think they may have forgot to put sauce on mine? The red salsa type sauce on the side wasn't very flavorful, it was more bland than anything. I would recommend an aioli or cream sauce. But everything about this restaurant is awesome. I love the atmosphere, the staff is very attentive and dedicated to ensuring an experience well-beyond my expectations! Also, I forgot to mention that they have a menu for DOGS :D My Maverick had rice, hamburger meat and a big bowl of water! In all honesty, I have never had a better dining experience than I did here at Lazy Dog. Mainly because I can bring my dog with  me to eat, but also because of the wonderful staff, location, and comfort of being in a place that feels just like home! Thank you so much Lazy Dog! We will continue to come here for as long as we live in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very fun place and servers are very nice. I had the sangria sampler and the ahi salad. The sangria sampler is awesome! The ahi salad wasn't anything special and they don't give you enough dressing for the size of the salad."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Lazy Dog Restaurant. Nate from Alaska (in case there is a another Nate there) was our server  and I ordered  a meal that was not even on the menu:a Caesar salad, shrimp and mashed  potatoes  and he made it happen! it was a generous amount of shrimp and mashed potatoes, the salad was fresh and quite large.  Nate suggested I get the shrimp topped with the sweet hot  chili sauce  and that was  wonderful! Also tried the Sangria sampler and was not too happy with the red sangria so the manager allowed me to switch it out for different one, very nice of her and the Sangria's were great, perfect size glasses. I can't wait to go back and next time I will bring my furry friend.  The service was great and the food was awesome!! Paws up to you Lazy Dog!!"}
{"text":"Opening day.  Great  menu and service .  Had the fish tacos and the beer sampler.  Two soft tscos6 wiyh generous  portion of mahi mahi covered with grated csbbsgr6. Mango salsa,  btoen rice and black beans on the side.  Beer sampler had six generpus pours ranging from light to stout.  Prices very ressonable6."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places in vegas to go! Not only is their happy hour menu amazing... Their staff is just as great (FIN & ANDREW B)! I always bring in my Yorkie for lunch since it's a dog friendly cafe & they even have a dog menu! Every dog gets a complimentary water bowl and they have $5 chicken breast and brown rice or $5 hamburger meat and brown rice for the dogs! So cute right??? Everything on the menu is yummy! Definitely recommended!

{"text":"Best place for my Hubby and I to go to a date lunch. Delicious food. Waitress Shauna was great. Their passion ice tea is awesome, I've had their fish and chips, best in town; Pot Roast French dip and now chicken nachos."}
{"text":"Great food.  Reasonable prices.  Great service.  Ask for Sarah she will take real good care of you."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. 

This is a very family friendly restaurant with lots of entrees to pick from.  My kids love the brunch here with their Dog Bone Pancakes, French Toast, and various kids Breakfast. I have ALWAYS get the the Pork Fried Rice on Sundays!  I don't know why I've gotten it like 10 times and I can't seem to want anything else?!

The kids menus are very reasonably priced.  4.95-5.95 and includes drinks and the kids meals are generous portions. Bottomless soda/drinks for the kids as well. And the coloring and crayons!  A must for family friendly restaurants!!

Service is good. Food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and the drinks are reasonably priced as well. $5 for a Bloody Mary on Sundays?!!  Yes please!  I'll have 3!! 

I'd compare this with a Cheesecake because of the variety but I think the cost is a little less. People can also bring their dogs to dine with them outside. I've been here probably 10x so far in the last 12 months and I've had a great experience each time!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service ever. It was so slow and took about an hour or longer to get food. Not worth it! Didn't even get some food cause we waited so long it wasn't even worth it. The burger took the longest. Really?! A burger."}
{"text":"Paula and Mason gave us great service. On top of the food it was a great place to try out.We we accidentally left our leftovers on the table and they were thrown away. The manager kindly came over and apologized and he brought us back a whole new dish to go. Meanwhile we were waiting for a food to take 5 servers came and asked us if we needed anything. I let the manager know that he has a great team and I felt very cared for while I was waiting. Coming back forsure with some friends."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars for The fact that you can bring your dogs and they have a doggy menu, but if just going by the food it's very typical chain restaurant food. I went with a group of people so we had a chance to try quite a bit of things on the menu and everything was okay but not great. The one thing that was really good was the butter cake. Patio is nice and spacious. The service was very slow and they could have been better trained but I'll give them a pass on this one since I went within the first month of opening, which is always rough. 

I love that they offer grilled chicken and brown rice for pups and they bring bowls of water in disposable containers for them. All in all I think I would only come here if I was planning on bringing the dogs."}
{"text":"I don't leave many yelp reviews, but my experience yesterday was so disappointing that I wanted to leave this one to save others from having the same experience. My children and I walked in the restaurant and there were three employees and the manager, Eric, at the hostess stand. I stood there for a few minutes while they carried on a conversation. At no point was there a greeting, smile or anything, until I interrupted and asked them if they knew where my husband was sitting. When I was seated, and I asked the server what he'd recommend for appetizers, he recommended two. I said I'd take both of those. Apparently, \"both of those\" also sounds like \"nachos\" because he brought me those as well, when I didn't order nachos, but of course still paid for them. The food was okay, but there are other restaurants in downtown summerlin that have far superior cuisine (crave, CPK, public school, etc).  When I pre-bussed the table by stacking empty plates, the manager asked me if I'd like him to take the dishes out of my way. I told him he could if he'd like and he responded with, \"We don't like people sitting with dirty dishes in front of them,\" which is a very odd response. A more professional response would have been, \"my pleasure,\" or something along those lines. Overall, it was not an enjoyable dining experience, mostly due to the poor service and management.  If you'd like to save yourself the disappointment, you might want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot for Monday night football. At least when we were here they had happy hour till at least 9pm. I ordered completely off the happy hour menu...Chicken nuggets are on point! The nuggets were plump, tasty and served on a bed of blue cheese Cole slaw, never had that before and was pleasantly surprised. Wings were 7/10 and pizza was good but was wishing for something a lil more crispy 7/10. My wife's ahi tuna was 6/10. The greens, tomatoes and olives were tasty however the tuna was fishy but edible. Service was sluggish at the beginning but came up to speed as appetizers were arriving, mostly due to game night I'd imagine. I drank house ipa, it was tasty but not as hoppy as I like. Overall experience was 7.5/10! We will come back..."}
{"text":"Amazing service & food. The schnitzel & butter cake are to die for. A large place but it felt warm & inviting. Beer samplers are a great option too. Can't wait to come back with our dog!"}
{"text":"Clean place , no wait time to sit .... but to get your food will take a while , have been waiting 43mins and still nothing , waitress doesn't come to check on my table , bad service , good looking place though"}
{"text":"Wow, I am so so disappointed in you Lazy Dog, you got rid of the Hummus Trio. The replacement absolutely sucks too, I understand it's supposed to be more Mediterranean inspired but it's not good at all. I tried it just to make sure and it was really a waste of money.

You had a beautiful product with the Hummus Trio. I would come constantly just for that appetizer and now it's gone. I'm not sure why corporate would mess with a good thing like that, but I hope you listen to your customers. I won't be returning to any establishment now that this menu item is gone. It's a true shame."}
{"text":"Used to love this place! They took my favorite item off of the menu but there are other great items! The buffalo chicken lollipops and black and blue pizza are my favorite. Unfortunately the service has become quite poor during the last 6 months or so. I only go back because it's close to my house."}
{"text":"My first time at this Lazy Dog and it was A-OK. It's cool you can bring your dog to eat with you, but you can only sit on the patio if you do. I will commend them as they were kind enough to put up with our ever-growing group. We started with 9 of us, but by the end of the night we had added 5 more. Our server was kind and patient with us while we all chose our food and drinks. Everything came out fairly quickly which was nice and unexpected for such a large party.

The menu is so strange. It's bar food but also has some Asian dishes and Southern comfort food. I ordered the fried chicken dinner which sounded so much more delicious than it was. Here is how they describe it. \"Hand-dipped buttermilk boneless chicken thigh, red skin potato mash, white gravy, spiced maple syrup, sautéed bacon + spinach, roasted sweet corn wheels\". Sounds amazing, right?? Well it might have been but the whole meal was super salty. I could only choke down about half before giving the rest to someone else. The chicken was more like chicken fried steak, and not like traditional fried chicken which was a let down. The spinach was good, but again too salty. I enjoyed the corn wheels that was the only thing that didn't seem to have salt. I washed my meal down with a 16oz Blue Moon. 

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. It did take a while to get refills and sides of sauces that were requested. We also had 2 items that came out wrong, but they were quickly corrected. This is probably a one and done for me."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars to our wonderful server Mikey today for being on it. My dog and I stopped in and couldn't have been taken care of any better than we were by this ambitious server. The food was on point and nothing beats the house red that he recommended for me today. Definitely coming to this location again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My family and I go at least once a week. Last night our server, John, was great. All the staff seem very attentive and happy every time we go. Food has always been consistent and delicious. Great place for entire family, including dogs on patio, which is hard to find in Vegas. The butter cake is my favorite dessert in Vegas. All the apps are a fantastic way to start a meal. The ambience has a very California, calm appeal."}
{"text":"Carmen here is a great waitress and she gave great customer service. And she's so nice and has an amazing smile and makes my family and I feel at home (:"}
{"text":"I've been to this location more than handful of times, and each time I'm always pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. From time to time, there's been a bad apple in terms of not being very attentive to our table, but overall I truly love coming to this restaurant! 

First, this place is just so fun because I can bring my big, black lab along with me to dinner, which is always a treat. Most places (even if they are 'dog friendly') really only cater to small dogs. This makes my 100 lb hard to bring along. This place does not shy away though! They have a lovely outdoor seating area that is very spacious. You never feel cramped or uncomfortable outside as they have shades/fans/heaters for all types of weather. To top it off they even have a small 'doggy' menu for your fur-baby to eat from. They automatically provide water for your dog as well, you don't even need to ask it just comes out with your own drinks. 

Speaking of menus, the people menu is very large and offers a ton of variety. This is always great because we like to come here frequently, and being able to try plenty of new dishes is always a huge plus. To add to this, the food is just delicious. I've had everything from pasta and salads, to burgers and pot pies. Each item has been wonderfully delicious. They do offer a full bar as well and have many fun house cocktails to choose from. They also offer house brews (which I adore). 

Overall if you love dogs, and good 'home cooked' style food, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to Lazy Dog and we really enjoyed our first visit which makes this 2nd visit so disappointing. It was a beautiful night, a rare night in Vegas one can eat outside. We were seated right away outside and all started well but the went downhill quickly. We waited almost 20 mins to place order, then we waited almost 30 mins for food to arrive. Either the kitchen was behind or short staffed. Food was as good as first visit which was only saving grace. They offered to give us desert and that ended up taking almost 20 mins more to come after we were done eating. Also disappointed, we asked for the kids dog collar and didn't get it either. The only reason we will come back is that the food was still good. Overall fun place, dog decor, if you have a dog and it's ok in public, you can bring them to outside and they have a special menu and water bowls for dogs. We'll give this place 1 more try to keep our business."}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago, just forgot to write review. This is my second time dining here, the first time was a disaster. But because of our waitress Lisa, she turned my negative opinion about this restaurant into a positive. She was so attentive and explained the menu well. I had the Fish and Chips (full order) and it was amazing. The fries were crispy just like I order. However, I ordered two breaded fish instead of one and couldn't finish it. It's definitely a big serving. However overall, I had a good experience."}
{"text":"First time going here just because I never heard of it. But hands down it was amazing! The atmosphere is really amazing and it was loud and fun! Definetly a great dinner! The food was really good and fulfilling! My girlfriend loved the salmon! And the burger was smack! Carol our waiter was very nice and amazing! She offered some great items on the menu and it was all great selections! Will come back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this resturant. Every time I enter someone if there to promptly greet me and whomever in with. I'm always offered bar seating, outside seating, or dining. I'm over 21 so I personally opt always for happy hour of its available in the bar area, and because I usually try to find Brooke! She is absolutely one the best servers there. She always has the right drink or food choice to try out. It seems I'm not the only fan base of hers, or she just makes friends with everyone there and treats like them like they have been friends forever. 
I have to say the outside seating area in the summer is the place to be because happy hour goes out there, and plus you can bring your pup! I personally don't have one, so I love seeing all the little fur babies hanging out.
If you're trying to figure out an entree, and maybe slightly hungry, a fan fav and my fav is the grilled garlic flatbread with marinara sauce, or if you need a bigger hold you over the chicken lettuce wraps are an excellent choice."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 or 5 times in the patio section with our toddler and small dog.  We loved this place because it was both dog friendly and well, toddler friendly (patio makes for lots of room to walk around without being in the way). 

The first few times we had pretty excellent service and the food was great!! This review will be based on the last 2 or 3 times we've been there (always in the patio, always with a toddler and our pup) Service in the patio has gone WAY down... I'm not sure if it's management's assignment of servers in that area or what, but something bad is happening and patio guests and their dogs are being neglected a little.

The most recent time we were there we sat for a solid 15-20 minutes waiting to be greeted and for our drink order to be taken.  My husband asked our hostess about 15 minutes after being seated if she knew who our waiter is and she said \"No, but I can find a server to come to your table...\" Ok. You're the hostess, shouldn't you know who is supposed to be serving us?? So eventually a female server came to our table and said she wasn't our server, but she could take our order. Oh cool!! Thanks. We ordered two iced teas and a water for our dog.

The iced teas came about 10 minutes later, but no dog water.  As a dog-themed restaurant that prides itself in being dog-friendly, it was kind of like pulling teeth to get water for our dog... Anyway, eventually after asking a few more times, we got some water for the dog and ordered our food. Food came out wrong, but was fixed quickly and tasted good.  

We also noticed the table next to us irritated about getting their food for their dog waaaaaay after they got their meals.  They ended up just getting it to go because they were done with their meals by the time the dog's food came.  

I hope the service inside the restaurant is better. It was a Wednesday night and definitely not busy in the patio. Maybe 3 or 4 tables."}
{"text":"This is going to be a simple review:

I have never been disappointed with ANYTHING I've ordered here. The chicken pot pie, the lamb stroganoff, the pot roast... don't get me started on the pot roast.

Service is always prompt and food is always on point. Very large and hearty portions. And you get to see awesome pups, duh :)"}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE STAFF!

Note: Monday evening, not too busy, but standard crowd, moderate noise level. We were a table of 7 people.

There were a few waiters assisting each other to distribute food to tables. The waitress who brought out our food was SO disrespectful! She was yelling out the plate orders she had in hand, none of which were what we had ordered. When no one claimed them, she looked at us like we were stupid, and repeatedly yelled out the orders again. We mentioned \"maybe you have the wrong table?\" She looked at us even more annoyed and repeatedly screamed the order again like we couldn't understand her (she's sighing and grunting) She then checked the ticket and realized it was in fact for the wrong table... 

I'm not upset about the mistake, but more upset she was screaming the order at us. She got annoyed when no one claimed the food THAT WASN'T EVEN FOR OUR TABLE..."}
{"text":"Great selection of food . Had the grilled salmon and it was delicious. Great sides - try the pickled cucumbers . Pineapple mojito was light and refreshing . Service was slow during the lunch hour . Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here lots of times with my boyfriend and we can't stop coming back here. It's the best place to be when you want to eat with your dogs. This restaurant will make them feel special because they're treated like people and part of the family. My puppy gets excited everytime she gets her own meal too. Their food selections are awesome as well. I can't wait to come back each time!!! The staff are especially courteous."}
{"text":"The food here is off the chain!! We had the fresh ceviche with guacamole and chips, that alone was to die for! We started out with the small dishes, we had the street corn wheels, which were corn on the cob with Mexican cream, fresco cheese, and cilantro! I was licking my fingers! Then we had the meatballs with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce....yummm! We also had the sweet potato tater tots with a lime aolie, we had the hatch chile Mac and cheese, it was fabulous! We finished it off with a butter cake with fresh strawberries and a balsamic glaze and a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!!!! We washed it down with the best bloody Mary's we've ever had! This place had great service, the manager stopped by our table to ask how everything was, we told him that we would definitely be back. He knew the history of the restaurant and explained that everything was made from scratch. That explains the goodness of it all. If we could give it 10 stars we would have, a definite recommend."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, wrapping the theme around dogs. They have several things in the business to set them apart from other types of restaurants. 

Came to them on a cold January day and was greated by staff. They were kind and overly attentive to my request. The food was great and service was efficient. If I was in the area I would definately vistit them again."}
{"text":"We are from out-of-state. Their service was absolutely great. The pricing was good. They told us where we can go fish and enjoy our kayaking experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING EXPERIENCE!! 

My server, Jennifer, was such a delight. She had great energy and truly showed her love for the restaurant and what it has to offer. She was extremely nice and accommodating. My mom and I shared 2 meals, which they split for us.. we weren't thrilled with the Thai Chicken Salad on the light menu.. and they took it back without us even asking and replaced our dish with something else... AN AMAZING BUTTER CAKE FOR DESSERT!! OMG. YUM.

Brooke was our expo, she is AMAZING as well. So fun and energetic.. bubbly and very knowledgeable. Her and Jennifer worked very well as a team making sure we received the correct dishes and drinks.. 

The restaurant is so cool.. very clean and homey feeling. LOVED it. Will absolutely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Usually my husband and I sit on the patio with the pups- food is always delish but the service always sucks out there. Came and sat in the bar area a few nights ago with my elderly aunt and omggggggg. FIN!!!! Best server ever. Such a sweetheart. Really went above and beyond to make sure we were great. She's awesome. Fin has restored my faith in lazy dog!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, dog friendly restaurant, server and chef are super friendly, you must try the chicken-poblano it's amazing! It has chimchurri sauce which makes it even more amazing lol! I will come back"}
{"text":"This place is a weird one for me.  I went for happy hour one night with some buds and although the service was good and the restaurant was a nice place to hang out, it was missing something.  Maybe it was because it wasn't busy and didn't have enough energy, maybe it's because I didn't bring my dog, but it's probably most likely because the food was not on par.  
Don't get me wrong, some things were good (the sauce that was on the edamame is ridiculously good) but most were just ehh.  The burger was super plain, the sausage and spicy oil pizza was mostly bread, the free Cajun fries with Yelp check-in, although awesome bc free and a good portion, were pretty boring.  The buffalo cauliflower didn't have enough sauce.  I also found it off-putting that the size of the happy hour dishes were considerably smaller than if you were to order it normally.  The point of a happy hour is to get the same food and drinks for cheaper.  That being said, the drinks, although normal size, weren't even discounted that much...
I will say I was quite happy with their beer flight, both price and taste.  I am disappointed overall because they have a unique, extensive menu and it seemed like such a gimmick when I got there.  I do want to go back and try it when it isn't happy hour but it will probably be awhile before I do that.  
If you want an extensive menu with exciting flavors, big portions, and a good happy hour, do yourself a favor and go down to Yardhouse instead."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this spot out. Finally got an opportunity to do a happy hour with my homies. 

I don't drink but my guys enjoyed some good adult beverages at good, happy hour prices. 

We sat on the patio, the weather was great and it was beautiful. Very nice and clean and well kept. 

The service was also really good. Ended up getting pretty busy as our party of 10 sat there from about 3-6.

I loved the fact that there were so many dogs there. I can wait to bring my pup back with me next time. They bring out a water bowl and even have a dog food menu. It's awesome.

I ordered the sweet and spicy shrimp. It was delicious. The waitress recommended it and I saw a ton of photos of it here on Yelp so I knew it would be a good look. Absolutely was. So try it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and drinks. Friendly and fun. We take out puppies there for a treat and they have their own menu!

Only problem is they don't take bookings for small tables and as we have to eat on patio with pups we have always had to wait over 30 minutes to get our table."}
{"text":"Great food but the service sucked.  Crazy slow server.   Our drinks came after our food. We asked that they just cancel the drinks. They said why dont we bring them but not charge you.  They brought them and charged us.  If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't recommend it.   Bruch sunny side pizza was fantastic.

Edit:  Went back again on the manager's dime.  Service was much better and food was still really quite good.  Updated the rating to reflect the average of the two trips."}
{"text":"Well, where do I begin? We went about three times and out of all three times, our food came out cold. They weren't busy. When I see servers standing around talking at the computer while we all have empty drink glasses, there is an issue. We kept going back in hopes that it was just a fluke because we did like the flavor of the food after it was reheated. Sadly, they should have remade the food instead of just heating it up in the salamander. Prices are pretty high for what is provided, too. No apology was offered by management either after we complained about our food being cold."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is as generous as I can be.  
I would have messaged the business but I do not see the opportunity to message the business privately, which I prefer to posting a 2 star review. I understand any restaurant or business can have a bumpy day or night! 

I like this concept and enjoy Lazy Dog... But in the future, I will choose not to wait indefinitely for a table when everyone is hungry and we have brought our dogs:(  

I called in advance to make a reservation and was told that they take reservations 24 hours in advance, for parties of 7 or more. The person on the phone told me they were always busy and there is always a wait.  I did not love the response, but our friends really wanted to bring their dogs so we happily went.

Our group was told it was about a 20 minute wait... We sat and waited patiently on the patio with our party of 4 people and 3 doggies.  No offer of water or a beverage while we waited, for humans or doggies

At 45 minutes we were told we were 2nd on the list.  At one hour we were still number 2 on the list. We were hungry and wanting to know how much longer it would likely be.  We were told some parties had been at the tables on the patio for Over 4 Hours and they had No Idea when we would get a table:( 

We discussed the situation and no one wanted to wait on the stone benches any longer... 

We left and walked next door to another restaurant's patio, sat down immediately and enjoyed a Fabulous meal on the neighbor restaurant's patio.  They welcomed us and our dogs.  See Spot Run next door"}
{"text":"Servers were nice and food was good. Just be careful around the other patron's dogs. Mine as well as another dog was just attacked and the owners didn't even apologize or acknowledge the incident."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is amazing and the drinks. Must come eat here. Our server Jackie was awesome, she took very good care of us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. My experiences in the past were fine, but things have changed. It starts at the top, and the top is obviously not paying attention. The service or lack there of was fundamental. It was as if this was the first server job my waitress had. Surprising and disappointing."}
{"text":"I went here for a date and it was amazing! The food was so great, my favorite being the steak. The atmosphere was very pretty but it was also loud enough to feel comfortable in. The waitress accidentally added chicken on my pasta and immediately apologized and got me a new plate without chicken. She then boxed the last plate with the chicken and let us take it home!! Now that's what I call good customer service."}
{"text":"The Skinny: the food here is not that tasty. Portion sizes for the price are not that great(2) service was pretty standard (3) value: hard to justify coming back when there are better tasting restaurants nearby for way better price point. (2)

Went in for a quick lunch on a weekday and came away disappointed.

Just FYI -  this joint is highly popular with the Summerlin crowd. 

I ordered the chicken pesto salad which came with a little scoop of sun dried tomato hummus and two miniscule slices of flathead. The grilled chicken had that rubbery texture and was rather pale color with some grill marks on it. It definitely was not tasty. Worse yet was the super odd pesto it was slathered in. The hummus was completely bland. To be honest,  I prefer the Sabra's (yeah! the listeria laced hummus brand) over the the hummus I tried here.  The marinated tomatoes were unpleasantly sour and mealy while the portion of greens was rather small. Meh,  definitely had better.

The hubs ordered the fish tacos which sucked. He only got two tacos which featured dry bland mahi mahi. The pico de gallo was tasteless. It was served with rice and beans.  The hubs thought the beans tasted straight out from a can. He'd rather hit Rubio's. 

Service was solid and quick. We were tempted to send stuff back but we were in a rush and didn't want to bother. Instead we went home so I could wash the horrible aftertaste of the pesto from my mouth. 

It's hard to justify coming back here when the food isn't even good. Portion sizes for the price are also not that great but then again,  do you really want more of a bad thing? Avoid this joint like the plague (2 starred review)"}
{"text":"We were there over the weekend and the restaurant felt like it was opening weekend. Food was served cold and the waitress had to be continually asked to refill our drinks. We waited almost 20 minutes for two managers two poorly attempt to move our table. They sat us in a table that had the sun beating down on it. Instead of moving us they continued to seat 3 other families in open tables. Finally we had to come up with our own solution and move our own table. Very disappointed in a restaurant that has been open for awhile now. It appears the management needs better training in problem solving"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great vibe for the puppies, courteous staff, good prices! Will come back often."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by here while out shopping in Summerlin, really enjoyed everything we had. The atomic fried rice was so good, and only 5 bucks during happy hour! Pizza, waffle chips and salad we split were all great also. Hope we get one of these restaurants up in Seattle someday :)"}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Summerlin several times and love it. We take our dog there and it's perfect for him. We were ecstatic when we learned that a lazy dog was opening closer to home. 

We went here before a movie one night. The food was great as expected, but the service was terrible. Multiple plates were brought to our table but none of them were ours. Many of the things we did order came very late. We ultimately had to order our dessert to go as we needed to make our movie. We chalked the experience up to a combo of new staff and a busy weekend night. 

We came back several weeks later with the dog for a late lunch. The patio was busy but not full. While our service was fine, we noticed several occasions where servers wakes around with plates in hand, unsure of the table to go to. 

How is it that tickets are not correct on a consistent basis? It's very clearly a training issue and it is sad that a good establishment is being ruined by crappy service."}
{"text":"This place is cool.. I was surprised at how extensive the menu is..I would like to try all of it. We got here 15 minutes before the happy hour and we didnt know. So, we got seated and we asked our server for the happy hour and she gladly gave us the menu and waited until its time to order. The food was really good. And for the patio seat on a beautiful 70's weather it was perfect. The dogs come in with their owners and they sit there on the side. Most of them are well trained. We dont have a dog but its nice to watch them all the cute furry pets. We will go back here with more friends."}
{"text":"Can't beat the late night happy hour! Cheap and delicious drinks and apps. My girlfriend and I always sit at the bar and think all the bartenders are fantastic, friendly and attentive. LOVE the sangrias, the high altitude chicken tenders, the calamari, the pizza, everything I've eaten here has been delicious. And of course, dog friendly! By far our favorite bar in downtown Summerlin. If you haven't been here yet you are seriously missing out."}
{"text":"Wife brought me here for lunch and it was GOOD.  Had the beer sampler (6-4oz tasters) that were decent.  I liked the red and IPA the most.  The wheat beer had TONS to be desired.  I ate the chicken bowl for lunch and it was good.  The chicken was a tad cold but overall flavor was outstanding.  I would come back here without a doubt.  The outside area is open to dogs which i found really awesome."}
{"text":"Had the New York Strip. Ordered it medium rare, like I always do. The steak came medium well. I also ordered extra mixed vegetables to take place of the mashed potatoes that were listed on the menu. My steak came with a pathetic pile of red bell peppers. Not mixed vegetables. Not even two different kinds of vegetables. Red bell peppers. I asked our server if this was a double order of mixed vegetables. He said, \"I told them extra,\" shrugged his shoulders and walked away. 
My son orders chicken wings about 99 percent of the time when we eat out. He wouldn't even eat the wings that were brought to our table. Who serves Buffalo wings plain with sauce on the side? I have never seen that before in my life. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place to check out. Great concept. Best part I get to bring my dog and have some beers on the patio!"}
{"text":"I have been to lots of places in downtown Summerlin. I have been to Pancho's and Pieology Pizzeria. I went to the lazy dog! I went with the ladies and the kids. I got fried chicken sandwich. Amy got the pork noodle. Jennifer got the fried chicken dinner. This is the out door mall I have ever went to!"}
{"text":"This place has nice staff and many cuisine options. The fluffy and seasoned pita bread with hummus is a great starter. I love the pan fried tofu with vegetables and the sparkling strawberry lemonade was very refreshing. However, I did not like the paper straw in the drink as it started to become flimsy after being saturated for so long and I could not sip to finish the bottom of the drink. Also, I had requested no mushrooms and my meal was served with mushrooms. I explained that it could have been more serious if it was an allergy as opposed to a preference, which is why I was frustrated having to pick them out. I also refused to wait for the meal to be prepared again, as I did not want my bf's food to get cold. 

Nevertheless, the server and manager apologized and the meal was taken off of the bill. We will be back because they do show a great effort to please customers."}
{"text":"What a great find!!  Everything is made from scratch. Food was really good, staff was friendly and the price is right. I can see myself becoming a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and food was amazing. Service was fast and staff was super friendly. Excellent lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Worst take out experience every! I arrived 10 minutes after it was suppose to be ready. 10 minutes have gone by now with a total of 20minutes late.. I check the order and it was all wrong. Wrong side and no lettuce cups. Burger over cooked. 

Never coming back again. Especially cause they wouldn't alert or get Manager for me."}
{"text":"Haven't had a meal here yet that I didn't enjoy. Only one complaint- the burger bun is too large and not quite right. Brioche buns are already over used so if you're going to bother, do it right.

This one falls apart when you're trying to eat it and doesn't really compliment the burger.


Other than that it's great. Go for their salads- totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant, so I was excited to try it out! What a great concept, I can bring my dogs along for a brunch with friends! 
But the stars I left are definitely for a reason. I came here last night for a friends birthday celebration, the atmosphere was really nice! 
But anyways they stuck us at a table almost touching people's booths so they couldn't get out or in very easy. As we ordered, got drinks and talked it was nice. Then after about 40 minutes waiting for the food, we finally got it. Anddddd my food was completely cold. No much flavor, and I ordered a burger medium, and it was so much more well than I asked. 
And the server kept slamming everyone's drinks and plates so hard on the table. It was ridiculous. 
I will not be back, it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow! I have eaten twice at the Orange Co restaurant,  and both times loved the experience.  Not so much here. We came here on a Friday afternoon (4:30pm, 6/30) when it was dead. The staff (greeter and server) is rather surly  (maybe because they have to wear tight flannel shirts in July in Vegas). The waitress acted as though she was saving any emotional energy for the Friday night rush,  and she had to be asked twice for appetizers,  drinks and condiments.  We got the Cajun fries from the Yelp app, and they were served warm,  not hot. My wife got a Cobb salad and had asked for bacon and dressing on the side.  She got neither.  When she asked again,  the waitress begrudgingly brought a small stainless cup (abt 3 tbps) of bacon and the same size dressing, as if it was done in spite. No apologies, no good humor. I would use a 1/4 of a bottle of dressing on a salad that size. I got the chicken pot pie for 13 bucks. It looks nice,  but it was a Shepard's pie inside.  Mostly mashed potatoes,  and very little chicken.  A couple of peas were noted. It was AWFUL. Then, noting that each of us ate less than half our respective meals she asked if we were \"saving room for dessert\". Hell no.  We couldn't wait to get out of there. Nasty experience!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner that entailed Nachos, Cajun Fries, Mojitos and a house salad all of which where phenomenal. We were waited on by a lovely server names ASHLEY. She was super friendly, outgoing and personable. 5 stars across the board for food and service!!"}
{"text":"Not bad overall.  Service was outstanding, the waiter was on point with his timing and refills and taking our order.  I ordered a salad & sandwich which came with fries. The sandwich and salad were both good but the fries were cold. I didn't really want them anyway but that's the reason for the 3* rating; would have been 4* had the fries not been cold.  

Decent atmosphere and good location off 215.  I would come back if someone asked but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Very convenient place to meet folks in the middle of town. Also I go there a lot to charge my Tesla and have lunch while I'm there. The staff is pretty good. I find the bartenders more attentive than the wait staff. I've had many different dishes there. The blackened chicken is yummy, as is the pork. The bison meatloaf is the best dish I've had there. It's super good!"}
{"text":"DON'T LET THEM SEAT YOU OUTSIDE IN SUMMERTIME-ALSO DANGEROUS FOR PETS.  I even called ahead, because I was bringing my dog with me to enjoy the patio.  I wanted to make sure the patio was cool enough to dine with your pet.  They assured me over the phone that there were enough fans and coolers in the outdoor area to be comfortable.  10 minutes after we arrived, to our amazement one of their workers came out and removed ALL of the swamp coolers from in the outdoor area.  IT WAS 2PM IN JULY IN LAS VEGAS ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  I asked that worker to leave our cooler by us, for my dog.  He ignored me.  40 minutes went by as we sat, sweated, and ate our food in 100+ degree temperatures.  My dog was overheating.  I asked to speak with the manager on duty.  When she arrived at our table, she acted completely unconcerned and walked away.  It was one of the very few times I've ever complained at a restaurant. Other guests on the patio were also not impressed.  Good luck with that kind of service in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Our waitress Christine was excellent!!! She was very attentive and friendly. The food was good. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at lazy dog for lunch and I was so impressed! The first time was great, this was even better! My server Jen D. was a total genuine rockstar and our service was amazing and super friendly from  everyone we encountered there. The Jamaican lemonade is fabulous and Cajun style fries are an absolute must. Thanks lazy dog! Thanks Jen!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and great food. White peach sangria and chicken lettuce wrap are phenomenal food. To top it off, Denise our server is very accommodating, she asked us several times if we need something else. She has a good customer service and very hospitable. She is a keeper! Kudos to you, Denise. You deserve to be acknowledged. We'll definitely com"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to go. They have such amazing food and service, they even let pooches on the patio. My personal favorite is the thai noodles and the bison meatloaf. Every time I come here I either get Ashley or christine as my server and they rock my socks off. Their  manager jake is always so friendly and comes to check on us. I highly recommend this place for everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"I love bringing my dog here to have lunch. The patio is very comfortable with woodland themes and a really nice fire pit. The dog menu is perfect
For my pups and they absolutely Love it. I also really enjoy their menu. We always get the roasted Brussels sprout small plates and order from the lunch menu. It's perfectly sized and tasty!"}
{"text":"WOW!!  We had the best time with the best food!  We sat at the bar with Kimmie and Ty as our bartenders. Each of them took their time with us and gave us a tour through the menu pointing out both best sellers and their personal favorites. We ended up with a Bison burger and a pork shank. They were both incredible but what really pushed us over the edge was their butter cake!  OMG!!  Best butter cake ever!!!!!!  You HAVE to get it! You won't be sorry!  I forgot to mention that we also had to managers visit us during our dinner and they really made us feel welcomed and appreciated. Food: 5 stars. Service: 6 stars!  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The food is pretty average. I've never had anything so far that blew me away. There menu is pretty generic. Don't think I'll be going back anymore.... Kinda sucks cause it is nice to bring the dogs."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the food was great and the service was awesome! Second time (yesterday) our server was incredibly slow and kept forgetting us. I normally don't knock a review for slow service, but there was a HAIR in my son's pizza. I told the waitress and she asked if I wanted it to be made again. Normally when this happens in a decent restaurant the manager comes over or there's some sort of apology.   At Lazy Dog the waitress acted like it wasn't a bid deal and didn't offer an apology or anything. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my son to get his food, not fun for a 4 year old. Overall I feel like it should have been handled much better."}
{"text":"Plusses:   New, clean, modern, food was very good.   Service:  Okay.  
Minuses:  
Do you like LOUD?   
They have two (count 'em, 2) handicapped parking spaces, where they should have five or six.  
Not easy for wheelchairs.  Best to park in back parking lot, which gives you access to the sidewalk leading to the front door.  
Most foot traffic coming from parking area would not use the sidewalk, thus are forced to walk up about ten stairs to front entrance.  I wonder what the designers were thinking:  \"We'll put the parking area here and the main entrance up this flight of stairs\"?
It was raining when we went, which made it a little more inconvenient.  
There was a nice outside area with a fire pit, (I wonder why the fire pit wasn't on?  It was cold) which we would like to try next time we go for an evening meal.  
Despite the negatives, the food was very good, so when we come back we will sit outside to try to get away from the noise."}
{"text":"The food was delicious & our server Alina was WONDERFUL!  We will request her on our next visit!!"}
{"text":"I had the warm chicken focaccia sandwich and it was really delicious! I love that dogs are welcome on the patio! Really cute place!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful surprise to enjoy such fresh, tasty food. The staff was well trained & attentive from the hostess to the wait staff. We will come again."}
{"text":"I like this place! Mostly because I get to bring my dog with me... It doesnt seem that there are very many places in Vegas that are this dog friendly so its a lot of fun to bring my dog by.

The food is a great price. They have lots of different options... from asian inspired dishes to american burgers. Lazy Dog also caters to vegetarians by providing tofu options on thier \"bowls\" and sides, starters, and salads that are great portions (I recommend the hummus platter and sweet potato tater tots). Pair that with one of thier fancy cocktails or a beer from thier list of drafts and you are golden!

Dogs also have a choice to dine with you where they are served brown rice and fresh chicken or hamburger. My dog love this place for this reason. 

The atmosphere is very family friendly so its a great place to go when family is in town or a casual night out."}
{"text":"Carrie S is amazing!  She was incredibly helpful and put up with a group of crazies.  The drinks and food were delicious!!!  I highly recommend you visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So far I haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like! My most recent visit, I got the pot roast with side Caesar salad. The sauce was very good, but I would have enjoyed a little more of it. The atmosphere is open and fresh, and it's a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is one of the many  dining options in Downtown Summerlin. I had a turkey burger on my first visit, and it was delicious. The bun was toasted perfectly and the patty was seasoned in such a way that I didn't miss the beef at all. The strawberry citrus soda is light and refreshing. Brunch time here is busy and noisy, so anticipate that. 

On a more recent visit, I ordered the carbonara. The menu says there is supposed to be a poached egg on it, but I opted to have it without. The pasta was good but I think the cook was pretty heavy-handed with the salt. The Chardonnay cream sauce was nearly drowned out by the saltiness. I hope that it was a fluke, because I would be willing to give it another shot. Try the Jamaican Lemonade...it's the perfect refreshment for a sunny afternoon. 

Their food and drink menu is huge, so I'll be back to try something new the next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Brandon was fucking AMAZING!!! He was super attentive, polite, gave us great Recommendations just a all around wonderful sever! It was our first time here and we COULD NOT Decide which desert we wanted so he bought one for us and we purchased the other one!! YAY How AWSOME is that!!? We will definitely be coming back 1000% 

The manager came and checked on us too just a great fucking place thank you Lazy Dog and thank you Brandon!!"}
{"text":"We have never been to a lazy dog or even heard of one but  me and my wife received an invitation to come eat wow we must say the food was great the atmosphere was fantastic but out server Jade was out of this world !! We are definitely going to recommend lazy dog to all our friends and family over all great experience!!! Will be back and soon and will be asking for Jade !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food and service is great! Lost a business receipt a month ago and the manger looked it up and re-printed. Definitely a place I would visit over and over!"}
{"text":"I ate there last Sat 5/13/2017, the staff seemed nice enough and food was ok. When I got the bill I noticed that there were charges on there that shouldn't have been. Once I spoke to the waitress she said she wasn't sure how that happened and then fixed the check. So imagine my surprise when I got an alert from my bank saying that the tip I left was very generous and I needed to take a second look at the charge. Seems the waitress added a 25 dollar tip to a 32 dollar tab. I have eaten at the Lazy Dog in Summerlin and had no problems, but I will never go back to the Lazy Dog in Town Square. If you choose to eat there, check your bill and bank statements to make sure that they don't \"give themselves\" a generous tip without your knowledge."}
{"text":"Upon entering the Lazy Dog, I felt like it was a five star experience! This is the first time I've been, and we came in for an early Sunday dinner. Since it was Father's Day, I thought that the wait time would be a very long one but to my surprise we only waited for less than 10 min. It was packed inside (as well as the outside patio) but that didn't take away from the quality of the food or service. The ambiance is also really cozy, kinda like a modern cabin so that's a plus for me.

A special shout-out to Jaimie, our server! She provided outstanding service with a great attitude throughout our entire meal. She gave various recommendations from the drinks all the way to dessert, and was very patient and informative. She recommended that we also save room for dessert because everything on the menu is delicious!
With that said, we decided to skip the appetizer because we noticed the very generous portions. We ordered the Black and blue burger which came with both blue cheese crumbles and dressing, the Bison burger which came with havarti cheese, and the Chicken Dinner. For drinks we got the House Beer Sampler and the Seasonal Peaches + Moonshine. The seasonal libation was quite fresh, though a tad strong but very tasty. I'd say that Hefeweizen is by far probably the best Hefe I've ever tasted--really smooth! Jaime mentioned that all their House beer comes from Golden Road brewery in California. I can't believe it, but we were actually able to save a little bit of room for dessert (which was on the house thanks to Jaimie) and decided on the Housmade Butter Cake which was beautifully topped with minted strawberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream--gorgeous and delectable! Similar to strawberry short cake which is one of my favorites :)

The only two things that would have made the experience a little better was if maybe they'd lower the music a tad because I felt like I had to shout across the table. The other thing was that the silverware and some of the glasses weren't the cleanest. Other than that, I'd like to come back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Driving through Las Vegas, we made the Lazy Dog our pit stop. The happy hour looks amazing and there are options for both vegetarian and meat eating pallets. We got Lemon Chicken on a bowl of their Ancient Grains and the Portobello Sandwich. Both dishes were quite flavorful and filling. Because we made sure to \"Check-In\" on Yelp the Lazy Dog honored their deal by serving us chili fries on the house. 

The reason the Lazy Dog didn't get more stars from me boils down to service. Even though the restaurant was mildly busy, it took several minutes for the host to seat us. After waiting at our table for nearly fifteen minutes, the server finally came to us asking what we were going to drink. Because we had been on the road for hours and still had more driving until our final destination, we were both frustrated by the time it took to finally get our food ordered."}
{"text":"Our food was \"ok\" , waitress was awesome - kyanna. Very attentive,  quick, personable. I'd like to try the ahi sandwich. Pizza was good, not amazing."}
{"text":"Great Job!! For just opening you would never know it! Great Service, Wonderful Food,  Relaxing Atmosphere!  Very knowledgeable staff..Had the Hummus, Pot Roast, & Bahama Chicken... Will be back soon with our puppies!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Reagan was awesome. Who can pass up free Cajun Fries?  K is getting the Fettuccine Alfredo and I'm getting the Thai Chicken Salad. 

Great location in the Town Square shopping center. Easy parking."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight and we had a good time. Unfortunately, the one thing my boyfriend came for, the bison meatloaf, was already sold out. He was extremely disappointed since that was the reason he came and didn't even want to stay after finding out. I don't know if it's a usual thing of selling out like that before dinner, but I hope it doesn't happen again if we ever go back to try again. Food was good. The calamari is great. The texture and taste isn't chewy or fishy. The salad could've been a bit more filling. It was almost all greens and the pot roast wasn't anything special. The loaded potato hush puppies are amazing tho! So is the smores dessert. As for the service, our waitress was very helpful, just wish the wait times were shorter and that we would've gotten our drinks refilled faster."}
{"text":"We came back and it was back on point. Great service and the only thing I didn't like was the Thai chicken salad. It tasted like boiled chicken which I can't stand being that I grew up with chickens and smelled them being boiled when it was time for slaughtering, ick. But all the brunch menu items we got were fantastic. The chicken and biscuits is slightly sweet and perfectly fried:"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Atmosphere was amazing and the staff was great. The food was good and with 29 people.in our group they were spot on with everything. We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"If you have an option to skip this location and go to the one in Downtown Summerlin I recommend you do it strictly because of the service. I have had many more instances of bad service at this location. The food is usually comparable and good but the servers here have no idea which tables belong to them. Multiple times I have gone here I have sat for 10 minutes before anyone comes to even take a drink order even when it's not busy. I also often have been ignored and nothing frustrates me more than when you pay almost 4 dollars for an iced tea and never get a single refill until you have already signed the check. I blame a lot of this on the leadership and management at the store. It should never be a question of which server has which table. Last night we had to ask several other servers for help because ours disappeared. Even the table next to us ended up with a manager coming out to apologize to them because they sat there forever with no service."}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly..food was very reasonable and delicious! We were able to bring our dog and sit on the covered patio. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place, loved it, and we will be back.  The wait staff were great, the place was very clean, the food was outstanding,.....but one person really stood out.  The Hostess Idellis (forgive me if I misspelled)...She was everything a good Hostess should be.  She made us feel special, and welcome, but most of all she thanked us for coming in, and she was genuine.  5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"We always choose Lazy Dogs when none of us can agree on what we want to eat. They have a wide variety of items  to choose from on the menu. They have a great happy hour and a lovely patio that you can enjoy with your furry friend. This is definitely a go to spot when you're looking for decent food & good service."}
{"text":"I've never dined at Lazy Dog, but I do remember having it brought to me in a Togo container back in California. It was their seasonal lamb stroganoff, and man was it the BEST thing ever. However, when I dined into this new location a week ago, it definitely was a bittersweet experience. The location itself was BEAUTIFUL, and knowing I can bring my pup there is exciting to me! After choosing a booth in their car seating for happy hour I noticed that they had a seasonal item that said it was a pasta dish with a creamy lamb sauce(I assumed it was the same as the lamb stroganoff I had). I ordered it, only to be told 10 minutes later that it wasn't in season. So I was definitely bummed but I didn't mind too much, and ordered the carbonara. Afterwards the gentleman who told me that it wasn't in season came back and said the chef in the back said he found the ingredients to make it, so I got excited all over again! I didn't mind that my dish arrived 10 minutes after my friends did, but what I did mind was that it tasted bland and was almost cold. I was super hungry, and was on a time crunch so I just ate it. 

Service id still give a 5/5, but for that dish in particular I wouldn't order again. I definitely believe I'll enjoy this place, but maybe ordering something else."}
{"text":"Food is nothing to write home about, service was kind of slow but the atmosphere was priceless. We sat in the patio with our 3 dogs (Doberman, and two French Bulldogs) and genuinely enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Been back twice since the previous review. Sadly each time it has gotten worse. When my wife was served undercooked chicken, the manager tried \"educating\" us about cooking chicken. I cook for a living. Raw thigh meat is... (wait for it)... RAW THIGH MEAT! He was gracious enough not to charge us for salmonella, but did make sure to charge us for the inconvenience of having to reorder. If he would have just said sorry, tossed the chicken and threw us a freebie on the replacement? You would not have to read this.

Friendly staff, from host stand to servers and bussers. Wife had pot roast dip, good. Crispy ribs and umami fries for me, really good. House beers were good, as well. Everything is fresh and made in house. I would absolutely come back here. May become my new go to place. My only minor critique is they are newly opened. I would like the staff to know more about the menu and drinks. I mean this as the most minor issues."}
{"text":"Never a dull moment at Lazy Dog. It's always breath of fresh air when the Bartender remembers your name and  also your Favorite drinks. Andrea always on point when I  sit at the Bar. Last thing I want to do is wait for drinks or my food to come out of the Kitchen when I get off form work. Coming back just because  of Andrea  amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"We now have 2 Lazy Dog locations in Vegas and I must say that this one is a lot better than the one on the strip. We came in for a business lunch and it was pretty dead. A large group was able to order and get their food pretty quickly. The waiter was attentive and always coming back to the table to see if we needed anything or to refill our drinks. I think this one is a lot slower than the one at Town Square and I like it a lot better. They don't run out of food like I've had happen before. Tho, I did have them get my drink order wrong a couple of times in the past so I had to sit and wait for them to remake it. I got the beef dip sandwich this time and it was pretty good. Fries need some seasoning or something on them tho. They were pretty bland. I love the decor at this place and I love how you can bring your dog and eat with them on the patio. I haven't brought mine yet since she's a puppy and doesn't have the best dinner etiquette, so I can't write about the patio yet, but I do love the idea knowing I can when she's ready."}
{"text":"Nasty food and service went a few months ago service was bad then thought of giving another try because a business can have an off day well it's just nasty, food is barely edible, and the service is to be questionable."}
{"text":"We had this food at a conference so it was take out. Their turkey sandwich was good and had real, thick turkey on it versus grocery store deli turkey which was much appreciated. However I thought their Caesar salad was really the standout dish! It was so simple yet so tasty! 

We also had the brownie with clumps of sugar in it and strawberries and it was phenomenal. 

The service we received was lackluster. Food wasn't ready on time. No plates or utensils offered with pick up. But the food made up for it."}
{"text":"I love eating at Lazy Dog, the Summerlin location is super friendly. Our waiter Sergio Salazar was awesome!! He was so patient and friendly, made our time very pleasant. I would definitely ask for him next visit. The food is delicious, you can't go wrong with drinks as wells. Next time I'm bringing my puppies with me. Awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Lazy Dog twice now, both times for lunch with coworkers, and both experiences unfortunately paralleled each other. 

Service on both occasions was extraordinarily slow. The waitresses were very nice but came across as incredibly too busy to be in any way attentive. On this second occasion, we ordered a little before noon and did not receive our food until at least 12:50. 

The food is blah, of the Applebee's/Chili's/Friday's variety. I don't mind a wait for really good food, but nearly an hour for mediocre \"casual American\"? No thanks. 

I don't see any reason to return here, especially considering I can get comparable food at comparable prices with better service from a number of nearby restaurants and not have to worry about taking an extended lunch."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to go.  Dog friendly patio, do menu, good food decent beer selection and good prices.

Unfortunately, the last few times we stopped in for dinner we had issues being seated.  We also keep getting the same waiter who clearly doesn't stay focused on waiting tables.

Regarding patio seating - when we first started going here the entire outer patio was reserved for people with dogs, allowing you to tie your dog to their railing.  Then they changed and only allowed dogs on the far end of the patio, including in the middle of the patio.

This time, we were told that there are only a small number of dog friendly tables on the patio and they they are all near the entrance.  This means that our dogs are distracted by the people waiting for a table, children running around outside and other dogs waiting with their people.  Thankfully our dogs are well behaved, but multiple children ran up to our dogs and stuck their hands through the railing to pet them.

When we inquired as to why the dog seating had changed, we were told that too many people were complaining about dogs on the patio and they reduced the number of dog tables in order to accommodate the other guests.

This restaurant is called Lazy Dog, they offer a dog menu and there are multiple signs indicating that there will be dogs at the restaurant.  If you are offended by dogs or allergic to dogs, perhaps you should either eat somewhere else or eat inside where there are no dogs.

Despite really liking this place, I'm not sure if I'll be back.  There has to be other dog friendly dining options in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went here for a company lunch.   The place pretty nice.  I had the bison burger and wow it was tasty.  They also had pretty decent fries.   We sat out on the patio.  There was about 20 of us in the party and our server really busted his but to make sure everyone got their orders and that they where all right.   I will definitely go back and I usually don't joints like this but I am certainly impressed."}
{"text":"OMG! The sweet potato tater tots! Fricken amazing!!!! The Calamari stir fry nice and tender : perfect for a meal , just saying:) I was afraid to come in because of how busy it was :( but plenty of seats and greAt service! TL awesome adorable bar tender! If she recommends something! Try it!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! My dog enjoys the chicken and rice and It's so much fun to have lunch with your puppy! The food and service is is good as well!  There waiters everywhere at all times so you are never left alone with no service.  They always come by to ask how things are going and if you'd like anything else.  The dogs everywhere are so much fun too! There food options are the norm American food: flatbreads, pasta, salads, sandwiches, burgers.... And for dogs they offer either chicken and rice (brown or white) or hamberger pattie with rice (brown or white).  Great place to enjoy with your four legged family member! Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are from out of town and while visiting Las Vegas we came here twice, once for dinner and second for dinner.

Lunch was decent, I had the shrimp taco special while he had the blackened chicken bowl. The blackened chicken bowl was HUGE, but had a ton of mix-ins that made it really great. The chicken also had good flavor. 

My shrimp tacos were pretty good, but came with a lot of plain slaw that could have used some dressing. They also came with a cup and a half of plain white rice. Next time I'd ask if they could swap it for Spanish rice. The blackened chicken bowl was the winner of the two.

For dinner I had the pot roast while boyfriend had the portobello burger. Hands down, the pot roast was the best I've ever had! It's super tender, comes with spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes. So good!

We also split the Lazy Dog flight to try their beers, all of which were good.

All in all, this place is great for a wide variety of food choices, decent (not overpriced!) prices, good atmosphere, and good beer."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant! Whether your looking for a dog friendly place, great food, excellent hospitality or amazing adult beverages, this is your place to go. I've been a huge fan of the chain since they opened up in Huntington Beach, Ca. I recently moved to Las Vegas and both Lazy dogs near the airport, and in Summerlin will amaze your taste buds, your heart, and your dogs taste buds with the dog friendly menu. From Brunch to dinner, and happy hour to lunch I love Lazy dog. Thanks for today's hospitality to our server Erica, and Brooke the manager. Check out their new menu March 27th they're pretty stoked to share the excitement."}
{"text":"Stopped in just before noon in hopes of a quick bite. Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, comes with Cole slaw and fried onion rings.. Maybe Bleu cheese too. Food was served quickly, staff was friendly as well. Enjoyed my sandwich, I wouldn't order the fries again. Not that they were awful, just missing something. Definitely consider again."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I love their spacious patio. I had the grilled cheese, Cajun fries, and the smores for desert, so good!! Sarah was our server she was great, very attentive and she answered all of our questions. We will be back for sure. 

- Love,  The Caesars Lunch Crew"}
{"text":"The service was great, don't get me wrong. I loved the environment, but my whole family got sick after eating here. People who had chicken got food poisoning. Just be careful when eating at this location."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Prices good.  Sat outside with the dogs.  Dun to see all the dogs with their humans in tow.  Planes a little load."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday and had a great time.  The staff was nice and the food was great.  The people working there were very friendly and helpful.  Nice place to enjoy a meal.  It is a little loud in there.  Glad we stopped there and had dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the food, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere playful! Today I had the pleasure of being helped by Phallen (hostess) and Sam (our server), they both were excellent and attentive! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the energy level and the food was spectacular!  Can't wait to go back and try some new dishes. Our server Jimmy was very helpful and attentive!  He really knew which beer we would enjoy, and took his recommendation and turned out great."}
{"text":"I really do not know where to begin. Friends with one dog asked us to meet them here for dinner with our two small dogs. For a place supposedly catering to dogs I found it just the opposite. While waiting outside for our table on the patio there are no poop bag dispensers and no place to put it after you pick up after your dog. People that had brought bags were just leaving them in the planters as opposed to bringing it into restaurant.
Once inside the only place for your dog was to tie it to your chair. Not cool at all as other dogs coming in were too close.
Waitress did bring a small bowl of water to table for dog which was nice.
Food was mediocre but desert was ok.
Concept needs a lot of improvement before I return. Waitress was nice but out of an item we ordered for desert and dinner hour was just beginning at 5 PM!!!
Do not let the 5 star reviews fool you if you are a dog owner; probably written by staff and owners..."}
{"text":"Definitely would not go here for the taste of their food.   Menu has a bunch of interesting sounding food but then tastes not so great. The only reason we go is for the drinks and the fact we can bring our dogs but as of lately, they don't seem very dog friendly at all. Many other restaurants that allow you to bring dogs and treat you and them with much better service. Wont be back again. The server was rude, we waited 30 min for our food, and she forgot to put it in. Then we asked for a manager she said no one here sorry.  We tried the new dishes pot pie was cold in the center barley any chicken, then the pot roast was so tough and cold would rather eat somewhere with better customer service and food."}
{"text":"We've been here several times now, always had good experiences. Today's visit with Channon as our server was fantastic. She was easy going, yet attentive, and super friendly. One of the better dining experiences I've had in months. We opted for a starter this time (2 people) we usually don't get apps. We had nachos for a starter, I'm a bit difficult because I'm vegetarian but Channon was super able to accommodate - splitting the nachos half chicken half vegetarian. Our entrees were both excellent. We had a burger and an entree portion of the ancient grains/Kale salad. Only thing I could mention was that the fries tasted like they had been fried in oil that was also used to fry fish. I thought it was the calamari, and Channon told us it was actually just other fishes that got fried in the same oil. Most people wouldn't notice this - I am a chef by trade so I pick up on these things easily. Everything else from start to finish was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Place is very warm & comfy...staff is ADORABLE...food was tasty & very fresh, drinks were good!
Will definitely be back & with our dogs too!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog's food is stellar, but the service at this location can be very weak. The last time Mom and I went, we were bypassed several timed by our hostess who focused more on tables she felt an affinity with, only trying to strike up conversation at the very end of our stay. Never asked if we needed refills, etc."}
{"text":"Incredible tasting food at stunning prices! Electric, upbeat atmosphere in the dazzling Downtown Summerlin location. The environment makes you feel like you're at a huge Friday night party.

The portion sizes are hefty enough for two people to share one plate, so the prices are definitely justified. Servers are all over the place because its insanely busy, but none of them seemed like they'd rather die than be there. Jennifer R. was as attentive as the high speed environment would allow and sincerely friendly.

Jennifer and another server highly recommended the butter cake desert. For fans of sugar cookies, pound cake and ice cream, it's an amazing treasure. Pure joy on a plate!

Will definitely return. :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by Lazy Dog when it first opened, had a couple beers and some fine, but forgettable, food. It took an eclectic group in search of an outdoor patio to bring me back a few years later for a fun evening around the fire pit. Then as fate would have it my love and I found our way back again at the request of our oldest daughter less than a week later. I wouldn't argue with those that shell out four stars for Lazy Dog. They do a pretty good job with the price-point they are working with. In fact the food may be a little better than that of your typical Bar & Grill, but after sampling nine different items this week, I didn't come across a reason I need to rush back Lazy Dog. 

The most recent visit led us to the patio for an early dinner. The weather was magnificent this evening and the bustling patio was entirely full by the time we left. We might have been the only table free of a canine at our feet. Needless to say, we were serenaded by the squawks and barks of many a four footed friend throughout our time there. Why is it that the smallest dogs need to yap the most? Alas, I digress. Here in lies THE reason to go to Lazy Dog: they are certainly one of the most dog-friendly establishments around. That is, here in lies the reason to go, if you have a dog, the weather is great, and you don't mind the obvious accommodations that come along with a patio of dogs. So...I also wouldn't argue with those that would offer up two stars on atmosphere alone. 

I enjoyed the Fish Tacos and Wok-Fired Calamari the most, but also had some love for the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts. The Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara, Seared Ahi Salad, Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl, and the Lentil Soup were all fine, as were the Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned and Asian Pear Cocktails...I might even order these A-OK items again if I was here.

The dog-friendly patio even comes complete with a dog menu of three dishes for you pooch to enjoy while you eat your food."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever. My wife and I came for dinner and omg super friendly, really good food and are sever alejandra was really knowledgeable  and  helpful. Felipe came on check on us every was in while making sure we were ok. I definitely  recommend this restaurant. I give then 10 stars."}
{"text":"Very pleasant employees. They actually seem like they love their jobs. Our waitress was friendly and our meals were delicious. I had grilled shrimp tacos and my daughter had parm. chicken over a pasta with red Sauce. She equally enjoyed her meal."}
{"text":"just went for my first visit and I can say I will come back and try it àgain. sat àt bar and it was very busy thru out. ordered wine ànd my son had à few tastes of the beer till he settled on an IPA.  ordered the chicken lettuce wraps nice and crunchy with just enough for 2 people. son had the miso soy ginger salmon    I ordered the ahi tuna salad which I sent back as the dressing was just to heavy for me. no problem though as Terri the bartender  was awesome about it. every staff member seemed pleasant  and overall good time."}
{"text":"Omfg lazy dogs was the shit and Kristin the manager was amazing and Hannah was the best server I've ever had in my life!!! Def gonna come back"}
{"text":"I come to this location probably about once a week, usually for lunch. And I love their weekend brunch menu. The chicken and biscuits are my go to. The service is always great for me. I've had a number of different servers throughout my many visits here and all have been so pleasant. On my last visit I was waiting at the front for a few of my colleagues who were going to join me. While I waited (which was probably about 20 mins) the host Sue was kind enough to ask me if I wanted something to drink until they got there. Though I see her pretty often, I have never had a chance to talk with her for more than just a few minutes. She is sweet,  informative and funny as hell."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Drink was gone before I got my food.....received my food......ate my food. ....still no refill.  Pot pie was ok....they advertised  a large portion.....however it was 12 inched round and about 1/2 inch deep. After contacting the manager  he tried to make it right. Comped our meal."}
{"text":"I love dogs. I have three of my own and I foster. I LOVE dogs. So it's no surprise that I give high marks to just about any place that allows me to bring my mutts along. However, I have been known to go here for happy hour without them. So my rating isn't just about the dog factor. It is about:
*The nice, spacious patio that's a good option with or without dogs. 
*Service that has vastly improved since the opening. 
*Joseph James Citra Rye on tap.
*Sunday brunch menu
*Pitchers of sangria with 3 flavors to choose from.
*Happy hour Monday-Friday 3-6 and Sunday-Thursday 9-close 
*An enormous portion of Cajun fries on the happy hour menu for $3"}
{"text":"5 Stars for our server Finn! She's is extremely likable and GENUINELY friendly! The food is delicious and the menu is huge! AND doggies are welcome!!! Can't wait to sit around the fire pit! We will be back! Thank you Finn!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and if you happen to be near Town Square with your dog, they are welcome as well! Lazy Dog is a cool new restaurant that boasts some pleasant servers and cool decor. I can't wait to bring my pup here on the weekend. 

When you check in on Yelp you will receive an appetizer of Cajun fries for free 5/5. Good flavoring but needs extra sauce.

I have been here a couple times now for lunch and they still bring a smile to my wallet with their reasonably priced lunch specials. I have tried the grilled cheese sticks and tomato soup special 4/5. Basically a grilled cheese sandwich chopped up in sticks and stacked on your plate with a good size bowl of classic tomato soup. Today I tried the Wok-fired chicken tossed with Kung Pao sauce with white rice, you can opt for brown if you like. Delicious flavor and good chicken 4/5. 

Will be back again to try more lunch specials and enjoy some food with my dog in the near future."}
{"text":"Not a top pick for me. Service was pleasant and attentive. Good drink menu and even have their own brew. However, not so impressed with the food. Seemed to be lacking in flavor. Loved the fact that you can bring your dogs to the patio wherein which they'll provide a water bowl and menu for your dog!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times now and every time it gets better and better! We have brought four other groups with us now and every time they love it! Everything from the apps to the cocktails you can tell that everything is made with attention to detail and flavor. Strongly recommend the mahi mahi tacos and Mai tais"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. We were seated immediately by a very friendly hostess. Drink orders were placed but it was over 30 minutes before our meals arrived. There were only three other tables in our section (a booth of four, a table of four with only drinks, and a table of ten). All of the lettuce in our salads (Cesar and Thai) was brown and looked questionable. The whole time I was eating I thought \"This will probably make me sick later.\" I had the chicken club and it was dry and bland. Steak and fries were bland as well. Save your time and money and head to Applebee's or Chili's - better flavor for better prices."}
{"text":"What can I say never dissapointed. Great food the only downside is wait time which is understandable can't go wrong with the Baja guacamole burger my other favorite dishes are the poblano chicken the ahi tuna burger but without a doubt you have to get the brussel sprouts trust me it's nothing like what your mom used to give you as a kid perfect pair with a 22 ounce Stella"}
{"text":"Great food and very dog friendly!! Po (our dog) loved it! More restaurants need to be like this one!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever received. Food was cold. The servers on the patio were arrogant and didn't give seem to care about their job given how rudely they spoke to customers. Dogs on the patio were unruly and the staff just let the dogs try to bite dogs walking by; also letting them bark the entire dinner. Just miserable. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances and yet I'm always disappointed. The food is mediocre and the service is completely underwhelming. When I fold the check and hand the server my card... is that a hint that I might not want my guests to see the bill? My fathers 60th birthday! When she returns and my name is clearly listed on the card, she hands it to him! Details. Details.
Might as well go to a Cheesecake Factory or Yard House. Yes, you get to bring your dog... but the gimmick doesn't outweigh the lack luster dining experience."}
{"text":"Good American food.had the bbq chicken salad and coconut mojito (yum!!) which was on the lower calorie drink menu. The wait staff was attentive. I would go back to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place based on the good reviews. It was not good we all had different dishes and they were all terrible. 1 hour later I'm throwing up. It was the worst meal I've ever had"}
{"text":"Casual ambience. Very dog-friendly (nice to see in Vegas) with a huge patio. You even have doggie menus for your best friends. Food is good. The trout was very good. Happy hour is busy but worth it!"}
{"text":"So excited another dog friendly restaurant opened and the food and service is amazing.  Had dinner ...we all tried something different, everything was very good, large portions, reasonable prices. We also enjoyed the house brew.  Nate was a very attentive server...on top of everything....he was on the spot.  Cant wait to come back with our furbabies."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Poblano and Mahi-Mahi Tacos. Very good Lazy Dog Pale.  Our server Jenn was friendly, and she made these spot on recommendations. Noise level is medium. Nice atmosphere, like a cross bet Claim Jumper and BJ's. Maybe could use a bit of pep from the hostesses though. It's always nice to feel welcomed as soon as you come into a restaurant. Overall, very pleased and would like to check out the other items on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. The food is amazing although it's difficult to choose what to order because everything is good. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Super affordable! They also have a menu for your dog! Definitely go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's dog friendly so the pugs can come along.  Service was great waitress was extremely attentive. I had the crusted tuna and it was so good and cooked perfectly. Portions were not too large or small just perfect. My daughter had the chicken pot pie and usually I am not a fan of this dish but hers was delicious. You could tell that the pie crust was made in house not frozen and the chicken mix inside was so fresh.   This place will become one of my usual hangouts especially if it is as good in the future."}
{"text":"I went with my husband. I was really looking forward to taking him there since I really enjoyed the Lazy Dog in Downtown Summerlin. Unfortunately, the location in Town Square was quite disapointing. I ordered the Thai Noodles which just ended up being a soup-ey mess. Between our appetizer and our meal, a server (seemed like the manager) placed a plate of what looked like potato chips on our table. She explained that they were complimentary-as a \"thank you\" for coming in. Although my husband and I appreciated the gesture, we're not potato chip fans. We politely asked our regular server to take them back. She seemed very irritated and frustrated at this request stating; \"well now we'll just have to throw them out\". Finally, our food arrived but was less than impressive (as previously stated). Our server kept our drinks refilled, but somehow refilled my husband's plane iced tea with some kind of sweet tea. Again, we politely asked for a fresh glass of tea, only to have the server roll her eyes at us and quickly take the glass away. The food was pretty unimpressive and the wait staff seemed frustrated with us. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. Food and drink menus are extensive. I'm sure you're bound to find something you like from appetizers, salads, burgers/sandwiches, rice bowls, pasta, American style dinners etc. 

I always get the chicken curry rice bowl with the brown rice option. Big portions! Enough for literally three meals. My boyfriend loves the pizza flatbread. Make sure you check-in! As of June 2017, when you check in....they give you free Cajun fries. Perfect little starter. Prices here are typical....kind of like BJs or Yardhouse.

The best thing about Lazy Dog is that they are completely dog friendly. You don't have to have a service animal to be able to dine here. Your lovable pooch is welcomed also! (You just gotta dine outdoors.) It's so cute seeing their personal pet menus! =)"}
{"text":"This is specifically for the owner, Mr. Chris Simms: Who the hell on your staff thought it was such a good idea to take the spinach dip and the Sriracha chicken wrap off the menu??? These items were not only favorites of mine but they were top sellers!!! Honestly, it was really STUPID to take these popular items off the menu. Instead of changing the menu every two goddamn months to please yourselves perhaps you should leave it alone and let your customers enjoy it. I will tell you this: if you or your corporate staff keep making stupid decisions with the menu, you will start losing loyal customers including me!!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a restaurant where you can bring your dogs? The food has always been amazing, and they even have a dog menu. The hummus appetizer and their take on pad thai are my favorites. My complaint is that we have had some really good service,and some equally bad service. Would've easily given five stars except for that."}
{"text":"This one star would be 5 stars if our food had been served hot!  We were a table of six the Saturday before Mother's Day. Three hamburgers with fries, two pasta dishes and a tossed cobb were ordered. The hamburgers, fries and pasta were all cool by the time they came to the table. My husband and I were guests so we did not say anything to the server.  Also, we waited an extremely long time after ordering before food was brought to our table."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and delicious food. Good alcohol selection as well."}
{"text":"We really like this new restaurant so much to choose from and very good.  This review is after my second visit.  Our first time we had a quick lunch with very good chicken wings.  I like that the sauce is on the side and not drenched all over.  During our second visit we had brunch to try it out and we were not disappointed at all.  Very large portions and a good selection.  I have to say this is our new go to spot.  Try the country fried chicken with eggs, real good gravy and the chilaquiles are so so good.  It's so cool to see that you can bring your dogs and eat in the patio area.  We are going to try it once the weather gets nicer, too cold right now."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant in downtown Summerlin. Can't wait to go back. Potions were huge. I had the pot roast....Amazing comfort food. My son had the New York Steak which came with a large portion of mashed potatoes and broccoli. Their homemade sodas were also very good. Our server Adam was great. Very on top of his game even with all the tables he had. Ate there mid afternoon on Saturday and the restaurant was already half full. When we left at 4pm , they already had a wait. I will definitely be returning with my husband and friends for drinks and dinner again."}
{"text":"Walking into this place was awesome. Brought a smile to my face to see everyone working wearing plaid shirts.   Loved the style. Felt like I was entering a cabin. The hostess welcomed right away. And we were seated without wait even though it was busy in there. Our server arrived right away and was friendly and polite. He offered recommendations for appetizers and answered any questions we had for drinks.  We got the hush puppies which were very good. The sauce was amazing. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It was delicious. The pickle slaw was perfect. Over all my experience was great. Its always nice to find a place that's family friendly, with great service, good food and great beer. Will definitly be back."}
{"text":"I took my girl Lola to Lazy Dog for her Birthday.  She loved the grilled chicken and brown rice.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Tim was awesome. He made us very happy and enjoy our Friday night. We love Tim!!! The food and the drink were really good too. Especially Atomic fried rice"}
{"text":"Great place love it!go you won't be disappointed Marina Degrandis was so pleasant and professional town square is easy to get to LOVE IT THE BEST I WILL BE BACK THANK YOU MARINA YOU ARE THE BEST."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with my bee girlfriend her first time here at Lazy Dog & she was quite impressed ASHLEY was our waitress & she is the best.  Ashley suggested Taco's for me today. I come here often with my 2 Yorkies and they love that they get there own bowl of rice. Daniel the manger was quick to make sure our order went fast. Love it here & I know Patricia will be back with her mom"}
{"text":"Had a late brunch here, after the Noon Year's Eve celebration. Had the Wok-fried Calamari, Veggie Omelet, and Carbonara. Superb dishes! Flavorful and filling. And we were lucky to have Alissa taking care of us. Ask for her during the weekends, outside (patio) seating."}
{"text":"Being from Central New York, we have missed our haddock dinners since moving to Las Vegas. Lazy Dog has filled the bill as the best fish we have had since leaving CNY. This place is awesome! Reminds me of restaurants from there .

We'll b back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place, the patio is awesome and I LOVE that it's dog friendly (as long as owners are smart and responsible). Food is consistently good, prices are reasonable, love happy hour, drinks are awesome and the staff is always so welcoming and friendly! One of my favorite spots in downtown summerlin for sure"}
{"text":"I came here with friends on Friday afternoon, it was not very busy, but we did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. I did see a lot of seating though, so maybe it was just a server issue. We got our orders taken fairly quickly and our meals in about 15 to 20 minutes. Everything was hot. The food was pretty good, I wouldn't call it the best cheeseburger I've ever had, but then again it is just a cheeseburger. 

I like that their menu is so large, I feel like there is something here for everyone if you bring a big group of people with varied tastes. There's even a low calorie section, which is nice for people who are watching what they eat. Also, you can find nutritional information via their website.

The most delicious thing here though are the sweet potato tater tots. How my I almost 30 and have now just had these? Like, seriously. Yumtastic. I need to see if they sell these frozen at my nearest grocery store!"}
{"text":"Came here on mother's day, so we were expecting a crazy wait time, but we were seated within 5 minutes. Denise, our waitress, was super attentive, and immediately came out and gave our dog a bowl of water as we sat down. After we ordered our meals, she let us know that the kitchen was a little behind since they were so busy, but she made sure our food was being prepared as quickly as possible. We didn't mind at all actually, it was a holiday and the restaurant was packed, but we appreciated Denise letting us know that she hadn't forgotten about our order. The food was great, and afterwards the manager Rachel came over to our table to apologize for the wait (which really was no big deal), and gave us a free appetizer card for next time. Both Denise and Rachel provided exceptional customer service, and we will always return and request for Denise to serve us. Thank you both for your awesome service!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice since we have been in Vegas. Since it is a dog friendly place our schnauzer was able to have a good lunch with us. The servers are extremely friendly and attentive. The food is very good. try the ceviche tostadas... We moved our Hotel out here to Summerlin for the rest of our stay and we will definitely being coming back again before we leave."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We had great service the food was awesome! I never finish a dinner salad. I had the steak salad and it was so amazing I had to fight the urge to lick the plate... after all I was in public... but considered letting my doggie table manners come out and licking the plate! We had the brownie dessert and it was like my mothers hugs! It was highly recommend by one of the Apple Genius guys and I also Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I spend our time together here. We love their local beer! That's apps are delicious! We love the atmosphere, the bartenders are attentive and friendly! 
 There is one negative things we've noticed: they all wear plaid shirts, like it's a cowboy themed bar. I don't get it. The T-shirts with the paw on was perfectly fine for working. I'm sure their shirts are uncomfortable! 
PLEASE CHANGE THE SHIRT!! 
 Lots of tv's with any game on. It's clean, in downtown Summerlin,  so you can eat and walk around, or vice versa. Great location!
It's our spot because of the bartenders, food and location! 5 minute walk to the Redrock Casino. It's a win/win!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a wonderful place to bring your puppy for a lunch date. The members of the staff are always attentive and cheerful. Lazy Dog's offers many appetizing sections from their vast menu (So far my favorite item is their, Roast Beef Dip sandwich and their pot roast) and they also have a dog friendly menu."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to have lunch/dinner. There's a lot of these located in So Cal...particularly in the OC area. Haven't been to a Lazy Dog since 2011 I think. Menu is very extensive, they got everything to fit your current food cravings. From burgers, steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, Asian inspired wok entrees and your grand salads. I would group them with Yard House and BJs. Prices are about the same too. 

I ordered the Bahama Chicken-grilled chicken breast, grilled and topped with sweet sauce, served with brown rice, cilantro black beans, pickled cucumbers and topped with sesame seeds and cilantro. 
Sounds like a pretty healthy dish. Erm, at least I would hope so. I portion controlled that so I wouldn't be packing on the calories plus I have leftovers the next day.

My friends both thought their entrée choices were alright. Wasn't \"freakin delicious!\" but it wasn't \"disgusting\" either. They ordered a black n bleu burger with fries and an Asian inspired sweet and sour chicken bowl.

Food was a solid B+ but the service was terrible. Our waitress wasn't too attentive...seemed like she forgot about us for a second. We didn't care too much because my friends and I had a lot of catching up to do....but if you're pressed on time. Be aware of that. We came here for dinner on a Thursday night.

Great place if you're a dog mommy/daddy. You can eat with your pet outside the patio. They even have their own \"Pet Menu\" too. SO FREAKIN CUTE!!!!!! =)"}
{"text":"Good food...good service...and best idea - accommodating our furry kids (dogs )! Even the doggy food was amazing! Been here twice and tried a couple stuff from their menu. Make sure to try the ones with the paw marks. Recently, we ordered the spiral pasta in meat sauce, pot roast beef dip, white chocolate-chip brownie, the cucumber thyme lemonade and the grilled hamburger pattie for my furry kid - everything was AMAZING. Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Dinner tonight after I arrived from our Hawaii vacay. Decided to take the dog out since he was boarded for a whole week with Family Paw and decided to take him out. 

The service wasn't all that great. I felt like we was an inconvenience. When we asked for a refill in water, she rolled her eyes. It's hot outside. Yes we had a choice to not bring the dog and ate inside in AC but that's the whole reason why we ate here.  We watched the other server and wished we sat at her table. She checked on all the tables. Our waitress probably checked up on us twice but when we wanted to leave, we waited even longer for the bill. And when the husband did pay with cash, she just gave his change without saying thank you. We dined at Lazy Dog in Summerlin and I'd say I'll drive all the way there then be back in this place. And food wasn't all that great either. Nachos was awesome. I had the Ahi sandwich. It was nothing special. But I'll probably not come here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a divine atmosphere. Food reasonably priced and very good. The restaurant  business plan and model is on the same line with BJ Brew house and Yard house. Lazy dogs prices are about the same or a little cheaper than Yard House. The staff was effecient and friendly. They do not offer as many different types of beers as their like competition. The patio is pet friendly and I must say all of the four legged visitors were very well behaved and compliment the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I come to lazy dog quite often with my German Shepherd pup. I absolutely love their food and their ambience with the fire pit. As i came in here the fire pit wasn't working after numerous tries so I was a bit bummed but the manager apologized. My boyfriend and I waited a bit of time for our food and when we came it was a complete disappoint. Everything was cold, and the dog's food was incorrect. Like I said I come here often so I knew something was off. I found the manager Kristen and explained to her something didn't seem right this time around. She explained to me the situation and promptly came out to see what was going on. She was absolutely phenomenal with her service recovery and this is why I'm writing this yelp and why I'll continue to come back. She fixed the mistakes quickly and was very apologetic. She is a great manager and the reason I will continue to come back after the situation we had tonight. Thank you Kristen for your fantastic service recovery and service excellence."}
{"text":"I was seated right next to the kitchen and it was loud. Hearing chefs sneezing and coughing make me nervous. The food was not something to rave about. Got the weirdest sweet potato balls. I will definitely be skipping this joint."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Lazy Dog since I visited locations in California, and I was so excited to hear one was opening out here in Vegas.

I've been a few times and each time, the food and service have been consistently great. Wait times have been extremely reasonable (even for weekend brunch times). Portion sizes are generous so if you're not super hungry, considering splitting!"}
{"text":"After just one visit, I love this place.  We'd been hearing the buzz about Lazy Dog's for a while and as usual, seemed to resist the urge to just fly over there.  Then finally, the schedule was open and we dove in.  Wow!

It was an expectedly busy evening and we didn't make reservations, but the wait wasn't bad.  They told us ~40 minutes and that's what it was.  With two adults and a child in our party, we figured we'd get to test the service, a good assortment of the food and get a little feedback from our son in addition to what we thought about it.  When you walk in, the place is decorated with a kind of western, domestic pet, industrial flair.  Go and see.  Somehow it works.  There are two cool industrial sculptures when you enter:  a horse's head and a dog.  Very cool.  We opted for first available seating which landed us on the patio, and a great time was underway.

Right up front, the place is dog friendly, as you might or might not suspect from the name.  Yes, you can bring your four-legged buddy.  The menu has a great selection for the humans, and several nice choices for your critter companion as well.  The pup will also get a bowl of water.  We weren't sure if there would be the calm we saw in Germany when we lived there (and it was common to see dogs at restaurants), or pet pandemonium.  Without exception, all the critters in attendance were well-behaved and under their owner's control.  Nice.

Since we sat on the patio, we had several dogs around us.  After ordering and waiting for our food, my son politely asked if he could pet a couple of pups near us and with the owner's permission, he had some new friends to keep him occupied while we chatted with the owners and waited for our food.  The menu is not too big but full of a real diversity of items, with something for just about anyone.  They also had a kid's menu for our little guy.  

Here's what we ate:  we ordered the Wok Fired Calamari and the Hatch Chili & Bacon Mac n' Cheese (off the small plate menu) for appetizers.  The calamari was made from nice sized strips (rather than the traditional small rings) served over rice and cooked with mild green and red peppers.  The Mac n' Cheese was some of the best I've had, with the chili's giving it just the slightest bite.  Perfect balance with the bacon and cheese, none of which overwhelmed the pasta.  For our main courses, my wife had the Pot Roast Beef Dip and I ordered the Chicken Poblano.  Both were fantastic.  The pot roast variation on the traditional French Dip resulted in my wife declaring this may be her favorite French Dip sandwich in the Valley.  The Chicken Poblano was perfect, with the sauce just perfectly the right spice and heaviness that it complemented and didn't overwhelm the chicken.  We were stuffed and while we were relaxing before paying our bill, we saw the Lamb Shank and Campfire Pot Roast delivered to a nearby table, somehow making use hungry again. They both looked and smelled fantastic.  I'm definitely going to try the Lamb next time we're there.

As the weather cools, don't forget there's a large fire pit in the middle of the outdoor seating.  Obviously surrounded by the tables on the patio, it's also designed to allow guests to use the side of the pit as their table, so if you're wanting a seat up close and near the warming flames, be sure to ask.

Located on the north end of Downtown Summerlin, there's ample parking all around the restaurant.  If you really crave keeping your car in the shade, it's not far to the nearest parking garage.  Very convenient!  Definitely give Lazy Dog's a try."}
{"text":"Loved the decor, food was pretty good too I am plant based so chose from some apps and starters. Shishito peppers were delicious, hummus was good, the pita was really weird almost like a doughy uncooked pizza crust. Kale salad was okay, overall good service! Sat at the bar and had a nice time"}
{"text":"Brooke and Scooby Rock!!!!!! They were able to get a very special message/sweet treats to my grandmother and her friends for me since I'm in another state at the moment and I am beyond words. Customer service is amazing and this will definitely be a place that we will keep in our top 3 list of restaurants to eat!"}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I visit Las Vegas we often stop at this restaurant for their happy hour. They have really great drink specials and appetizer specials ranging anywhere from $3 -8 per item.

As far as the food goes, everything we have tried has been good and the service in the bar area was excellent. I had the raspberry moscato sangria and my husband had a margarita. Both drinks were made well.

The Cajun fries are always our go to because they are delicious. They are not spicy, but the portion is large so be prepared to share. The Buffalo chicken lollipops were quite spicy, so my husband ended up eating those and I ate the barbecue chicken crisp, which is basically a barbecue chicken flatbread pizza. The appetizer menu is a smaller portion than the dinner entrée, but we were both full after those three dishes. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It brings me such pleasure and yet such pain to finally write this review.  Why?  Because I'm further promoting what could possibly be the best dessert of any restaurant I've ever had ever and I wanted to keep it to myself.   

Our experience here was great.  The food was delicious and the service was top notch.  Lazy Dog was the perfect place to sit down for dinner and take a break from all the shopping we did around downtown Summerlin.   

Lazy Dog has a wide range of food that was offered on their menus.  Pastas, meats, wok-fried foods, Hawaiian style ribs,  ahi tuna entrees, burgers, seafood, brunch foods, and so much more.  If you're trying to feed a group of diverse tastes, you will have no problem finding the perfect something for everyone.

My pot roast over mashed potatoes with sautèed spinach was amazingly good.  The meat was so tender and flavorful and the hearty gravy complimented it and the mashed potatoes very well.  There was so much in this one dish that I had to ask for a box to take home.  

My wife had the sundried tomato pesto pasta with a hefty portion of sliced chicken breast.  The flavors of their walnut-pesto cream sauce mixed with the tossed mushrooms, onions, and broccoli make this another winning entree.  

Onto their desserts: 

1) Butter Cake-  \"Don't resuscitate me.  I've died and gone to heaven.\"  Home-made butter cake topped with strawberry compote and a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by a sweet balsamic reduction.  This simple dessert filled me with such warmth and joy with each bite.  The butter cake was so delicious that I can't even type without pausing to stop myself from drooling.  I left the restaurant thinking and dreaming about my next time having this.  (Soon!  Townsquare location incoming!)  

2) Kid's meal \"Create your own Sundae\"-  This was a very fun take on a sundae.  A large bowl of ice cream was accompanied by side dishes filled with sprinkles, nuts, chocolate, and caramel.  My daughter was able to decorate her ice cream as she pleased.  She loved it.  My only question is how was this less than $3 ?!?  It was MASSIVE!  Truly, any kid's sweet dream come true. 

I can't wait for their second location in Town Square to open up as it's much closer to me than their Summerlin Location.   Until then,  I will gladly drive out of my way again for such a great meal."}
{"text":"Always I have a great time when we come here after church. Carol a waitress was awesome and very helpful. Great Job!! Tony was also awesome. If you want great food and drinks and awesome service please go to Lazy Dog and make sure you ask for Carol and Tony."}
{"text":"Went to Lazy Dog for dinner during happy hour. The menu offers lots of different choices and the portion are good size. Our server was Arizona ( the best server in the restaurant). She was awesome and very knowledgeable. Great Food and awesome service. Will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"The customer service was great they were very attentive to our table Ronnie did great job making sure we were taken care of!! Tony the manager made sure our every need was met great conversation with my man!!!! Will definitely be visiting soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Love the service. We are here with 10 people and our server Reagan is wonderful."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, dogs are allowed on the patio! Good lettuce wrap and pizza!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat with great variety of food at a good price and get Big portions. Looks like a lodge great for watching sports."}
{"text":"Our servicer Regan is on point! Thank you very much! Food is great. Place is cozy. Beer is great"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years. Visited this location for the first time for Fathers Day. After waiting 30 plus minutes to get seated (and watching other families getting seated before us) we finally got seated. We got our drinks orders in quickly. I ordered
the IPA beer sampler, which came out right away, however the rest of the drinks took an extremely long time to come out. After the drinks came out our waiter disappeared. The manager noticed we were restless and attempted to get our order started. We put in some appetizer with him and waited for our waiter to return. He finally appeared and we put in our orders. My wife's meal came out within 20 min, the rest of the meals took about an hour. Literally from 1:20 to 2:20 we sat and waited for our meals. No one ever came out asked how we were doing or explained the delay. Other tables seemed to be going through the same scenario. It was frustrating. The worst part is that the meals looked and tasted really good. They were cold, but very good flavors. The manager and waiter acknowledged the delay and apologized and tried to make things better by deducting some meals and apologizing for the mess. Which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars and not 1. I 'm guessing they were just having an off day. I may give this another chance once they get their shi*t together."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They weren't even busy and they took forever to approach me, my little brother and my dog. Not only that but they took forever to take our orders too and didn't give my little brother a kids menu! He's 8 years old so you really think he wants an adult menu? I sent the rice for my dog back because she didn't want it. She just looked at it and didn't want it. She didn't slobber on it, smell it or even go near it. She just didn't want it, and guess what? They still charged me for it!! They didn't ask us what drinks we wanted either and just gave us water. Then at the end of the night because they took so long I had to ask a different waitress for the check then they didn't check up on us again for another 30 mins to take the money. The waitress with the red hair then had the audacity to ask me if I wanted my change. Of course I do! I'm not gonna tip you for doing a lousy job!"}
{"text":"Not very happy that they allow dogs inside the restaurant. When I first heard about this place I had my reservations but when I read that the dogs were only allowed on the patio I figured we would try it out. However when we went to have lunch we saw people with a dog inside the restaurant. Very unsanitary. And no it wasn't no damn \"Service Dog\" either. I won't be coming back in here that's for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The food is great, service was excellent. Matthew was our server, he was on point. I have to say best food and service I have received in a long time. Everyone works together here, never went without a drink and always cleaning off our table. Highly recommended, will definitely come back. Super cool decor."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with total of 8 people. Service was outstanding and food was very good. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Brooke helped out tonight me she was so sweet and made sure we got our money's worth. Would definitely recommend coming here again thanks to her. Can't wait to come again next time with my family! 5 stars easily"}
{"text":"This place was awful! We got there around 8 at night and it was crazy busy! I had a cheese quesadilla that was horrible. It had very little cheese, and the edges were burnt. My friend's granddaughter got the make your own pizza and it was terrible. The sauce had too much oregano or some spice. She wouldn't even eat it, she ended up eating part of my quesadilla. I would not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was pretty appetizing! Love the scenery in this place and the atmosphere is vibrant and fun. Haven't brought my dogs here yet but def want to asap"}
{"text":"I visited this location twice while in Las Vegas, we stopped in for lunch the first time, and our server Ronnie was amazing. The next day we attempted another restaurant for lunch but the wait was too long so we decided to head back to the Lazy Dog and were lucky enough to get Ronnie as our server again. As a manager here in Torrance at Bj's  I was pleased to see that A) she remembered us from the day before and B) she was very pleasant and professional. Ronnie prebussed our tables in a timely fashion after appetizers, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to successfully complete a suggestive sale on apps,(I particularly enjoyed the queso dip and Brussels sprouts)  entreès, dessert and cocktails. She made helpful recommendations, had a very sincere disposition and showed exceptional customer service. I would definitely recommend; friends and family stop by this location when in Vegas. Ronnie made our dinning experience very memorable we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. I would love to have her as a part of our team here at Bj's.  If you are lucky enough to get Ronnie as your server you will not be disappointed, I joked to my friend service so nice we had to do it twice. Definitely a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty, and they even had a dog menu. I have 2 pit bulls and they were welcomed just like any other breed. If your dog does not play well with others or barks a lot - please don't bring them to restaurants. The tables are not sectioned off."}
{"text":"The Humus Trio is a great starter. Service is amazing. Food is good not too different then similar places but great drinks and the waitress, Clarice, went above and beyond getting us what we needed. We will be back again"}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is great and the fact that we can bring a dog in here is fantastic. Good selection of food and apps but the best part is the beer on tap! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"So an update.. the owner contacted me as if he was genuinely concerned and ask for my email so he could further contact me and make things right. NEVER received an email. Thanks for the food poisoning and the hospital bill. 

UPDATE: About 12 hours after coming here and sending back the turkey meatballs because they tasted very gamey, I came down with terrible food poisoning. So bad I was rushed to the hospital and put on IV fluids. Sickest I've ever been in my life. I even missed my plane home and two days of work. Absolute worst experience.. Be careful of what you order!!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of positive comments about this restaurant! Finally had a chance to get out there this weekend with my dog, a friend came with and also brought their dogs. Beautiful night to sit outside as a the sun was setting. The dogs ate great, full hamburger patty and nice sized scoop of rice..all for $5! The human food and drink was really good, but very costly! I know it's Summerlin, but not all of us have that kind of money. I will return again as a special night, it's a wonderful restaurant and environment."}
{"text":"I have officially fiund my new favorite eat spot. When they open the new store on my side of town, I will be a regular"}
{"text":"Horrendous food, good service. I've been here more than once and each order has been 100% terrible. It is not only my opinion, but my family's as well. Pass by this place! Food is too greasy. The eggs that I got in the brunch selection tasted like they were from a carton. To conclude, if Nickleback was a restaurant, it would be the Lazy Dog."}
{"text":"Amanda was our server, she is a 10 plus, top notch, high class server, probably as good as my sister Karen, who is a phenomenal server in the Mammoth Lakes, CA area.

We were starving and started out with Passion Tea, Hummus Trio and Corn Wheels as appetizers.  Another waiter brought us homemade chips as a \"welcome\" gift.

  (We also had our main meal:  Curry Tofu Bowl and Blue Cheese Burger, on hold in case we could eat more)....

 We ended up cancelling the meals as we were stuffed with the three appetizers.  Amanda could have not been more delightful and had held the order back as per our \"eyes being bigger than our stomachs\"!!!

So we decided to try a dessert, Banana Pudding and a Butter Cake ....in the end, she wanted to buy the buttercake for us...it was the best darn cake I ever ate...

We know Lazy Dog from California, the owners used to own Mimi's and after they unloaded that yummy restaurant, they opened this amazing \"fusion type place of tastes\" over a decade or so ago. 

The best service I have received in Las Vegas to date!!!!

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"After informing the waitress of my wife's peanut allergy, I specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in the sauce for the slaw on the ahi sandwich. She said no, I ordered it. Got my second bite into my mouth when she came back and said to my wife \"You shouldn't have any of his sandwich.\" Because peanuts. If you don't know the answer to a question where a wrong answer could result in a trip to the hospital or worse, find out. Don't make something up and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Have to agree with many of the other reviewers. The service is sub-par. When we arrived there was no one at the hostess stand and waited about 3 to 5 minutes for hostess to show up. After we were seated it took at least another 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence. Based on the timing so-far we immediately ordered the entrees with our wine and cocktails. The entrees arrived cold, but the server never checked back to ask if everything was satisfactory. When she arrived with the check I informed her that the food was luke warm/cold. She said she would inform the kitchen. 
Very difficult to understand why a multi-million dollar investment would be jeopardized by trying to save money on minimum wage staffing. Lazy Dog Corporate better wake up! The competition for Las Vegas restaurant customers is more fierce than a pit-bull going after a prime rib!"}
{"text":"The environment and atmosphere was awesome. It was my first time at this place and I wasn't disappointed. The staff was friendly and our server Sergio was attentive and provided great customer service. He always checked to see if we were okay and made us feel comfortable...we even got a conversation going on about horses, random right? I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience while having lunch here the other day. Our server, David, was very attentive. Loved the dog friendly patio and the doggie menu. Food was good not great but I had a blast dining out with my four legged friend :)"}
{"text":"This place probably the worst customer service you ever get as a chain restaurant. Only reason I stepped in to this place because of tesla supercharger locates my n front of this place. Me and my son went inside was pretty busy with large groups and all the waiters and waitresses running towards those tables and left is alone almost 30 minutes. Finally food came after my little boy was so hungry and again the waitress was no where near to ask any help. Probably next time charge my car will walk quarter mile to totter bone fish restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The staff is always so friendly and funny. I come here at least 3 times a month. The food is great and they're dog friendly. You can bring your dog on the patio. (It's heated so you won't be cold)"}
{"text":"4 of us gals had lunch here on our recent trip to Las Vegas. We enjoyed dining on the patio. Great service and food! Try the sweet potato tots- so yummy! Everything we had was fresh and delicious. Wish we had a Lazy Dog in Reno - hint hint."}
{"text":"Little flies buzzing around. Not a good sign. Food is mostly pre- made.  
I'll pass this one from now on"}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends decided to try this place for the happy hour. I must say I wasn't displeased but I wasn't amazed either. It was a fun place to hang out and the atmosphere I give an 8 out of 10. The patio was nice and you can bring your dogs but wayyyy to hot in this heat during the summer. It has a nice fire pit in the center so sitting on the patio come fall/winter seems more ideal. The house sangria was terrible. I got the sampler because I wasn't sure which I would like and I'm glad I did. The peach tasted more like vodka and rubbing alcohol and the other two tasted like a cross between a jolly rancher and cough syrup, not good. I did however get an extra dry extra dirty martini and it was fabulous! The happy hour menu was pretty delicious and had quite a number of options. We got the nachos, chicken tenders, and Cajun fries. The nachos were great! Perfect amount of cheese, avocado, salsa, etc for every chip. No chip was uncovered! The chicken tenders were basic tenders nice size and very moist. The Cajun fries were my favorite yum yum not too spicy but just enough flavor! If you looking for a laid back spot with a good happy hour this is the place to go; avoid the patio in summer and don't get the sangria you will regret it!"}
{"text":"They have such a HUGE selection here at lazy dog! Some dishes are a little boring and a little more on the bland side . But others are straight up outstanding. You gotta try the chicken picosha sandwich ! It's great! They also have the BEST strawberry butter cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! It's literally the BEST dessert of all time"}
{"text":"Wow came directly from the airport to Lazy Dog.  Found it on yelp and so glad we came.  Phoenix was a wonderful server.  Food was very tasty save room for the Butter Cake.  Thank you Lazy Dog for making the start of our trip awesome."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. Ordered the wings for appetizer. They were very crispy and had lots of flavor. I had the fish and chips and my boyfriend had a burger for our entrees. The portion size was great and the fish was also nice and crispy. The burger was also very good,  option to get regular or cajun fries. Our server was excellent. Drinks never went empty and she was very knowledgeable and made good suggestions on menu options.we didn't stay for happy hour but took a look at the menu and we will definitely be back to try it. This place was really great,  be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Service and food has started to go downhill since opening. I have not been satisfied with my meals the last couple times and we always get the same server he usually tends to the patio area, but always disappears inside and always seems unhappy , we are easygoing polite and not demanding so I don't know why he acts like this.. I rarely tip any less than 20% even if I dont enjoy my food I still will if the server is pleasant.. I give 3 stars because they still have a nice bar and selection of mixed drinks, and you can bring a dog if you like. In the past the female servers were really nice and friendly but I haven't seen them working since and we always get the same \"f*ck boy\" who does the least."}
{"text":"They have their food down like pros. Lettuce wraps, pizza and burrito bowl for lunch are all bomb. The reason I give it three stars though, is everytime I've been, the food takes 30 minutes to hit our table. It sucks. And the waiters aren't attentive. They're nice, but, not attentive. Surely I'll go back, but when I have a lot of time to kill."}
{"text":"Hot beef dip sandwich became lukewarm by the time it got to the table. Grilled chicken sandwich tasted like reheat! Nothing worse than that. Noisy place with bad acoustics so that even out server had trouble communicating with us."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Lazy Dog and this location is no exception.  Food and drinks are delicious and Brooke was helpful and inviting.  I love the sundried tomato pesto pasta (no chicken for me) and can't seem to deviate from that dish. Love the whole concept."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was very slow to get orders in even though the place was not busy."}
{"text":"Wish this place wasn't so far away from my house. Literally the opposite side of town for either location. But everything we had was great. Cajun fries were a large amount. The hatch mac & cheese was pretty small but could be shared between 2 people. I had the chipotle inside out quesadilla and it was delicious. My BF said his Mahi-mahi tacos were good too. We will return for special date nights etc only because of how far away it was."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Bartender was quick and friendly. Food service was terribly slow, the slowest I have ever had. They are understaffed, clearly. The positive, you can bring your dog and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"If could give seven stars, I would! 

Start out with the service. Channon was AMAZING! Warm, welcoming and from start to finish was an All-Star server. 

The food: the food is out of this world. I wouldn't believe this is a chain if I didn't KNOW it was a chain. Everything from scratch and it shows. Delishness? Off the charts...! The pace of the food coming out was perfect, just as we were finishing our apps, food was arriving, beyond impressed. You MUST try this place!!!!

Best place to eat in Town Square."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. My wife got a breakfast item. She took 2 bites and the server recognized it was foul and took it off the bill. I got a pizza and it was pretty awful. We did get this yummy calamri app which was great, but slow service. I wouldn't go back ever"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents early on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We wanted to sit outside but there weren't any tables available initially so we got a table inside but then ended up moving outside a few minutes later when a table opened up. I got a mimosa and the Thai Chicken Salad. I was surprised, they actually gave me a full small bottle of prosecco and about half a tall glass of orange juice so it was make-your-own-mimosa! I didn't use all of the prosecco in the first glass so asked for some more orange juice and the waiter provided that in a smaller glass so that was nice. The salad was good; very good flavor and not too large. The waiter was super friendly and attentive and it was nice sitting outside with the dogs!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill with mans best friend. Loved it. Great staff! Awesome manager! Came by a couple of times to check on us.  Made us feel very welcome.  They bring water for your dog and the dog meals look good enough for humans. FYI Most dogs don't seem bothered by it but for people with dogs who are afraid of thunder should know that loud planes pass over head regularly as it's next to the airport.  Over all I give it two paws up. Awesome place for puppy day!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit, and for lunch, but so far so bueno!  My hubby and I shared  the calamari appetizer and it was fabulous.  Served on a bed of rice (we opted for brown), and what appears to be prepared stir-fry style, the rings were cut into strips and breaded and tossed with sweet and sour style sauce.  Very light and a nice departure from the way calamari is typically served.  For lunch, I had the Tomatillo Chicken Enchilada off of the 650 calorie and under menu and it was honestly one of the best dishes I've had in a long while.  It was full of flavor, bright with lime undertones in the tomatilla sauce but what really kicked it up was the sriracha crema that was drizzled on top of the enchilada.  My hubby had the shrimp tacos, and although he said they were good, he ended up finishing off my food (for 650 calories, there was A LOT of food on that plate).  He said he'd definitely get it next time we go there.  Loved the atmosphere and feel of the place, it was open yet warm feeling and not overly loud.  Can't wait to go back to try out the drinks (James & Ginger, yes please!, or Coconut Mojito) and some more of the menu.  Another great addition to Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of this restaurant and now that I have dogs I love it even more. The patio is comfortable with a fire pit in the middle and several tables for dining. Dog diners are only allowed on the patio so if you prefer to be away from the 4 legged lovers, you have the option to eat inside.
The menu is basic, offering sandwiches, burgers and chicken/beef entrees. The also offer weekend brunch until 2pm. For the pups the servers bring out water and you have the option to purchase chicken and rice, hamburger and rice or a bowl of rice for their lunch. I always order the turkey and havarti sandwich on herb focaccia bread for myself. They have other great options but I just love this sandwich. 
The patio fills up fast on weekends so expect a small wait. It's nice to know I have somewhere to take my boys after the park for a nice lunch before work. Not all dogs get along but for the most part it's peaceful. I do appreciate the \"dog rules\" of no barking, biting or begging and they are not allowed to sit at the table or eat off human plates. 
Whether you are a dog lover, dog owner or neither this restaurant accommodates to all. Great food, great atmosphere and great prices!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday around 7 pm. It was pretty busy! We thought we might have to wait a little bit for a seat because a couple other people were but the hostess informed us that the high-top tables were immediate seating and we could choose which ever spot was open that we wanted. Woo-hoo! No wait! 

We sat down and waited a few moments before our waitress told us that she'd be right with us. A few moments later she came and asked if we were ready to order our food and for our drink orders. 

My boyfriend ordered the Black & Bleu Burger with fries and also a side salad, they give you an option of what type of salad you want. Boyfriend chose baby greens with ranch. He thought the blacken seasoning was a little salty, I thought the bleu cheese was overwhelming but he liked that part. The fries were just horrible.

I ordered the Ginger Soy Salmon and a cup of Chicken Tortilla Soup. The soup was good. The glaze on the salmon was super salty, I flipped the salmon over to eat it and left the top that was drenched in glaze. The brown rice was good but of course, the stir fry veggies were super salty, too since it had the same glaze all over it. 

Service was slow but it understandable since it WAS busy. Our waitress was nice but she was always rushing away yet slow to get back to us. The food could have been better but it wasn't so bad. I'd go back but I'd definitely try something else. The inside is huge, lots of seating and very tall ceilings. Clean and modern. There are cute pictures of dogs all over the walls since it's called Lazy Dog, ha ha! Loved the interior and decorations!"}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best restaurants in downtown Summerlin. And do yourself a favor and ask for Carrie R. for your server. She rocks!"}
{"text":"We love this place on the weekends with one of our dogs.  We used to live in San Diego and would go there so we were super excited to find one here!"}
{"text":"Great place with a nice menu. Lots of good stuff. It's really noisy in there but the service is good and the food is great! Not sure about the bring your dog to lunch thing, though."}
{"text":"I like the decor and atmosphere of the place.  High ceilings very light and airy.  Seems very gracious.  They have a large outdoor seating area that allows pets.  I wasn't crazy about the spinach salad but my friends enjoyed their calamari, sweet corn, rib plate and blue cheese burger.  Lots of American food.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Tried this after pulling into the mall parking and seeing the Lazy dog on Yelp. We shared the delicious Ranch Burger and fries, grilled artichokes, and the Butter cake on our server Rachel's recommendation. The service was great and the food was fantastic! The Butter cake is the perfect summer dessert- a mashup of cake and strawberry with icecream. If you are looking for a yummy place to grab a bite and watch a game away from the craziness of the strip this is your place."}
{"text":"Granted, I had just spend 3 days in the backcountry eating freeze-dried meals before coming here, but man did their pot roast hit the spot. We were staying at a hotel by the airport and were looking for a restaurant that was more affordable than what we'd find on the strip, but didn't want to be eating at an Olive Garden.

I was very impressed by Lazy Dog. The decor feels like Yardhouse or Brick House (both large chains) but instead of a beer/sports vibe, it has a dog/sports theme. How could you not love the various forms of dog art on the walls. The whole dog theme seems a little odd, but if I lived in Vegas and could bring my dog to dinner, you'd bet I'd be here once a week.

Now for the important part....the food. With a large variety of options, you'll be hard pressed to find something you don't like on the menu. I indulged in the Campfire Pot Roast (I had just burned a ton of calories hiking, I'll eat what I want!!!), while my table mates chose the Pork Shoulder and Ahi Tuna. All of us were very pleased with the entrees and the assortment of sides that each meal came with were also pretty bomb. Considering this is Vegas where everything costs a portion of a mortgage payment, not only were these meals delicious but they have very hearty servings at an affordable price.

Pros:
-Clean, modern atmosphere
-Food that hits the spot without denting your wallet
-Service was fantastic and very attentive
-Large array of choices

Cons:
-Better food options in Vegas, but at a significantly higher price bracket
-Even though I liked it, you can't help but feel you're in a chain restaurant (which it is)
-My food came out luke warm, but my friend's meals were fine (they did replace my meal with a new plate that came back hot, so while I'd mark it as a minor negative, they made it right with me"}
{"text":"My husband and I went and enjoyed the late night happy hour in the bar area. Our server, David, was spot on and very attentive. The super prices during happy hour allowed us to try a variety of menu items. The ahi poke and hummus trio were delicious."}
{"text":"I brought my Mom here for her Birthday and had the best experience! Our waitress Ronnie was beyond amazing! She brought my Mom's dessert (Butter Cake) with a birthday candle and sang Happy Birthday to her. Thanks to Ronnie for making our experience even more special. It was also my Fiance's first time eating here and said he definitely wanted to come back to try more things. It takes a lot to impress him so that says a lot! Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow at first, but once a server actually got to our table, it was nothing but greatness. Haha. Food was pretty good, prices are decent and portions are huge! Great environment and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend to someone in the mood for a relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I went to the Lazy Dog Las Vegas for our Valentine's Day date. Service was unbelievably bad... and we are certainly not the type of people to complain, given the fact that we spent a huge part of our day there just waiting for our food. About an hour after placing our order, we were wondering what on earth was going on. Our waiter finally came over and said he had \"no idea\" what happened with our food. He gave us each a bowl of soup for free, which was nice. But it was still another 30 minutes before our food got to our table. The food was piping hot, so I am guessing the whole order had just been forgotten or the order was misplaced, so then they hurried and made it. But nobody ever came over to explain that there was an issue. they literally just let us sit there for hours and did not care to inform us of any problems. It was not terribly busy either, yet we spent over 2 hours there. There was no compensation, no discount, nothing. Bad service in my opinion, and I'm very easily pleased!
I would give it a one star except I LOVE the food. So there's that."}
{"text":"I can bring my dog!! What a plus! 
I've been to lazy dogs a few time and enjoy everything I and my friends have ordered. The first time I came with my aunt for lunch and ordered the tortilla soup and Cesar salad. She had asked for the dressing on the side and they made a mistake and put it on. They were so sorry about it they removed it from the bill. I thought that was really nice of them. The next time I came for dinner with some friends and ordered way too much. I order the hatch chile & bacon mac and cheese, loaded potato hush puppies, and some drinks. My friends ordered the chicken pablano, cheese pizza, and black and blue burger. The mac and cheese was a little spicy but very good. The hush puppies were good but I didn't have room to finish them so i took them home. Our waitress was the best. She had great recommendation and really knew the plates. I like when people know what they are talking about and can give you suggestions. We also order the sangria sampler which is a great idea. You get 3 little mason jars. They have peach, raspberry, and pomegranate. It's a cool place in downtown summerlin and i'll be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"There's nothing fancy about Lazy Dog however what they do offer in appetizers and being able to bring your dog is rather cool. For your birthday, they' send you a coupon for either the free hummus trio or a free dessert. My girlfriend and I are just 3 days apart we indulged twice. 

I've only eaten at LD a handful of times but so far the best waitress I've experienced was Daria at the Summerlin location. She was on point in bringing out orders on time, bringing extra bread for our hummus trio without question or added charge & had a fantastic attitude. 

I may be a little bougie preferring the more intimate dining experience with a menu that skirts outside the norm but I'd never say no to a meal at the Lazy Dog. Oh, and the new Chile Verde Nachos....perfectly chased down with a glass of house Chardonnay (or beer)."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I like the bar atmosphere and their happy hour prices are very reasonable. My problem is that the food is just not very good. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce was quite thick and the pasta tasted too chewy like it was undercooked. The corn chowder is decent but a little too heavy. The chicken wings and cajun fries are the kind you find at any bar.

I went there close to midnight and there was one server working the entire time. There were about 7 tables and it's just too much to ask for one server to handle! Needless to say it took forever to put in our order and to get the check. Can't blame the server but management should really have more than one person working??

All in all, it's a decent place but it's a very tough sell considering all the other food choices you can pick from around the area. There's far better options and Lazy Dog just didn't impress me too much. I will most likely return for their drinks and maybe try the food again then, but my first impression of the place was MEH."}
{"text":"We love trying new places, and our really good freinds had raved about how much they loved this place!

So we decided to try it out! Once we walked in we saw a table of about 30 children screaming, jumping up and down, having a blast. Clearly a party or sports team or something. Cute, but not the dinner experience I was hoping for...don't get me wrong, we love kids. But you get it right?

At the host stand, we asked for the \"adult section\" She laughed, and knew EXACTLY what I was saying!! Brought us to a cozy high boy table, and we were happy!

The food was really good, the service was even better and I cannot wait to go back and try some more. Maybe next time on the AMAZING patio!!!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting patio in summerlin....

It's so sad when they have the best real estate in downtown summerlin.....it's dirty, food all over the floor from previous tables, I don't think I saw one busser that was only just zoned for the patio(which they should at all times) ever come outside just to at least buss tables or remove glasses and dirty plates that were sitting around the fire pit....servers and managers walking past dirty areas for almost 2 hours and never once grab anything to clean up anything. I love dogs and having lunch with them are great but seeing empty doggie bowls all over the patio and not one person pick up just at least one was ridiculous. 

The service was really horrible it just sad because it's such a great place to enjoy the summer patio and I would never go back again....my best advice would be schedule a busser that only takes care of the patio at all times so people can actually enjoy a clean patio with smiling dogs....."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp tacos and it's one of my favorites because I like how they use cabbage instead of lettuce, you can taste the sauce, and it's crunchy. It's definitely worth to try."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I thought Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar served hot dogs...forgive my ignorance. Instead they have a dog friendly patio, where they will willingly bring a bowl of water for your four-legged-companions, or you can order some food for them as well, while you are enjoying American-Fusion comfort food and drinks.

It was a beautiful, sunny day in Vegas, when we opted to grab a table outside on the patio...and as you may already know, if you decide to sit outside, then you should be entirely ready to be serenaded by dogs in every possible note.  

I have so far had the following items:
Fish Tacos
Wok-Fired Calamari
Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara
Caramelized Brussels Sprouts
Seared Ahi Salad
Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl
Lentil Soup
Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned with buffalo trace bourbon
Asian Pear with grey goose pear vodka


Most of the food items I have had were delicious and were good portion sizes. Service has been prompt and professional, and they were willing to accommodate some simple requests, and even suggested another modification to help ensure that it would come out the way we would like. 

Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar is the perfect choice to bring your dog out, or hang out with a big group of friends on the patio. They also have seats around the fire pit, so if you are a little chilly at night, this is still a good choice.

{"text":"It's such a shame . We have been here 3 times and we really wanted to like it but it's just not that great. We love bringing our dog there but we had to ask for water for him 3 times. The service has gotten progressively worse and the food is bland."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! It's my favorite birthday dinner!!!!! Got to take my best dog friend and celebrate Laura is amazing!!! My first post and well deserved!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am updating because Lazy Dog contacted me and invited me back, let me tell you that the service and food was phenomenal.  Daria was our server and she was on point with everything and super sweet and nice. We started with the spinach dip which was so cheesy and good.  Our meals were mom's pot pie, pot roast beef dip and a pizza, everything was cooked to perfection and we were all happy with this visit.  We are thrilled with the outcome and we definately will be repeat customers now."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a busy primetime Friday night. We got seated quickly. NO ONE approached our table, we left and walked out after 15-20 minutes had passed and went to yard house instead. The people on the other table were yelling \"where is our waiter?\", while waiting for their check. Either the place was understaffed, or the staff needs better training on handling busy times. This was an unpleasant experience for me and my party."}
{"text":"Love this place love the staff. Humus plate is the best. Everyone is so freindly and they really care about the customer."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for business and stopped in on way to airport. Sat in the bar and had prob the best service of any restaurant . Very attentive and the I had the bacon blue burger and it was excellent and well prospered"}
{"text":"We had a great server named Channon she was an amazing server. Very helpful, sweet and kind. Food was great. We will most definitely be back and requesting Channon to be our server every time."}
{"text":"My waitress was Reagan, she was very delightful and helpful. I checked in on my Yelp app and received a free Cajun fries  they were delicious. I ordered the Chicken Havarti Sandwich and apple cider coleslaw which was dIt took awhile to receive my food, which was ok because everything is made from scratch But the fries kept me busy so order a appetizer The atmosphere was great. And I will definitely return"}
{"text":"With a party of 6, we had pleasant and prompt service. Between coffees, bloody Mary's and mimosas, everyone was happy with their drinks. We sat on the patio where it is dog friendly. It is a large covered area and you can bring your pet dogs as well as service animals. They even have a little menu that you can order from for you dog! (i.e. rice, veggies and/or chicken)

My dog was a little freaked out by the approach of planes overhead since it is so close to the airport at town square so be aware if your dog is sensitive to loud noises. 

I am vegan but nothing was obviously vegan on the menu (think hidden ingredients). I asked the server about the teriyaki rice, veggie and tofu bowl. The tofu is normally dipped in egg or some other animal product but she checked for me (so nice!) and they could make it without that. Sold! I'm always appreciative when the server meets me with concern or willingness to ask about an item on the menu.

Everyone enjoyed their meals which were mostly breakfast/brunch items. I wish there were more options for vegan variety at this place and nothing was over the top delicious but definitely great for groups."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about five times. Usually the food is fairly good, this time, not so much. I ordered the turkey burger with fries. The burger was nothing to rave about, but pretty good. The fries were awful. You can get better fries just about anywhere, and for the price, you expect such a simple thing to be good. The other flaw was the iced tea. Iced tea has to have ice. If it doesn't, it's lukewarm and kind of blah, which was the case on this visit. The service and atmosphere is the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"First time coming here yesterday and I would say its a must come back too. I only give it 4 stars because I went around 12 and it was a slower time so not sure how their service would be on a busier time. I brought my dog with me so he can feel special and it was nice to find a nice restaurant that allows dogs. We sat outside fast and great service from the start, I acknowledge the rules for my dog even though seeing another dog he almost ruined it ha but he learned to behave there and just lay down until food came. The pricing for food and what you get from it was well worth it. It gave you the fancy atmosphere with out the expensive pricing you think to expect. I would definitely recommend this to my friends with dogs to go to even if you don't have dogs I would say give it a try too, I'm just not sure how it is during a busier time how everything is."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Bring your dog to the patio. They even have big bowls of rice and chicken or steak or you could buy for your dog. Great happy hour S-R eve 9 - close and M-F 3-6 w really good food specials, the food is great, and drink specials too."}
{"text":"The service is okay, the hostesses seem like they don't want to be there. But the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service doesn't usually get recognized and many times I don't go out of my way to acknowledge people but Drea deserves a shout out!  Drea has a positive attitude and provided great service.  The food was great, and the drinks even better!  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Quick Look: Brand new, large restaurant structure in Downtown Summerlin. Unfortunately, the nice new build out could not make up for the bland and tasteless food. 

In Depth Review: I know it's a corporate \"chain\" restaurant, but I had driven by a busy Lazy Dog several times and thought it must be good, just look at all those people. Tried it on Wednesday, July 29th at 7pm. The restaurant was packed out and bananas. People seem to love that chain restaurant food here. The hostess sat us in a small two person booth in the back near the kitchen and a fireplace. Was not the best seat as a serving station was directly behind me, and I had servers chatting away and pounding on a point of sale system over my shoulder. 

Our server was attentive and very friendly. We placed our drink and appetizer order. I told her we would wait to place our dinner entree order as we did not want to be rushed out. She seemed confused by this. Glad we made this decision as the kitchen was cranking food out at a super fast pace and timing was off. Our drinks arrived, and then our brick oven spinach and sun dried tomato cheese dip was brought out. About 5 minutes after we ordered it. It was in a baking dish and it was a boiling hot liquid. Did not look like any cheese dip I have ever seen or had before. Had the consistency of water. Was so hot we had to stir it for another 10 minutes before we could eat it. Sadly, it missed the mark and was bland. Could not taste the sun dried tomatoes, or the cheese flavor at all. 

For our entree we ordered the new fennel sausage, goat cheese and mushroom pizza. We also each ordered a Caesar salad. The salads came out and were a generous size. Within 2 minutes of our salads arriving they brought out our pizza. The table was a small two person size, so we were now sitting there all crowded and trying not to make a wrong move and knock something off the table by mistake. Timing was off big time, would have been nice to enjoy our salads prior to bringing out the entree. Our server apologized and blamed it on the kitchen. The pizza did not come with a spatula (pizza server). They said they did not have them to offer. Never experienced this at a place that offers a entire section of pizzas. Buy some dang spatulas (pizza servers) and offer them to your guests. We had to rip the slices by hand. The cheese and toppings that had not been firmly cut through in the kitchen slid off a few slices, this was annoying. The pizza looked great, but again it fell short and tasted bland. The dough was fluffy and the crust was very chewy. Not the typical brink oven taste we expected. It wasn't a horrible pizza, it was just not memorable. They give you a Styrofoam container to take the slices home that you do not eat. Most places that offer pizzas (think BJ's) will give a small pizza box to put slices in. So we had to stack and bend them to get them to fit properly. We would pass on desert as we were not feeling it at this point and just wanted to go home.  

In Summary: The drinks were good. The beer was cold. The service was attentive and friendly. Sadly the kitchen and the food failed to deliver. The entire experience was not that memorable. If I want to go to a chain restaurant with a similar festive atmosphere, I will take my business to the consistent and tasty Yard House up the street. Besides being able to sit on the patio with your dog, I guess I am failing to see what the big attraction is at Lazy Dog?"}
{"text":"Carlos (Los) is the best goddamn service person I've ever had the honor to come in contact with in my entire life. I've never been so pleased with recommendations the way I am with his. This guy rules. The fool rules. It's my new favorite eatery because it's the restaurant that keeps on givin'."}
{"text":"I came here recently on a Friday night around 7pm with a party of ten for a pre-wedding day dinner ( I had made a reservation a few days ahead) and it was a great experience. We were seated right away and from then on our waiter was very attentive. He took our drink orders, appetizers, then dinner orders. He checked on us regularly with a smile and a positive attitude. He was helpful when we had questions about the menu. I enjoyed my portobello mushroom burger and the rest of my party was very happy with their meals and drinks as well. 
The place was packed, but it was not overwhelming with noise. There were a few TVs in the bar area that could be seen from where we were so that was a bonus. I do have dogs and I would like to come back and have them enjoy a meal out on the patio."}
{"text":"We love Lazy Dogs! The food is consistently good, very unique atmosphere, friendly staff. I love the mac&cheese, tortilla soup, grilled cheese and tomato soup, trout dinner really anything on the menu. Plus love the patio for taking your dog buddy with you."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed this restaurant. They provided fantastic service and great food. When we walked in we were seated immediately. They asked if it was our first visit and we let them know that it was. They walked us through the menu, specials, and drinks, and we decided to do a full meal experience.

Starting with complimentary cheese Flatbread and an order of wings, we were really happy. With an order of beer samplers,the wings were hot out of the fryer and crispy. We downed wings with 6 samples of beers and that made the start of our weekend a good one.  All 3 sauces the wings came with are delicious but we really didn't need it.

My husband ordered chicken, wok fried, teriyaki style, and I grabbed their classic cheeseburger. Both dishes were fresh and tasty. I loved every bite of both! Their teriyaki chicken is crispy and well balanced of sweet and salty. The burger was well seasoned and juicy. A great dinner. 

To come full circle, we grabbed the butter cake. I will dream of that buttery goodness until our next visit. We ordered the balsamic reduction on the side to keep the cake pristine in flavor and we're so glad we did. I'd order it again as my only meal. Sweet, creamy with crunchy edges...it was addictive. 

Great service and food equals a regular stop for dinner.  I cannot wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"My family went here for dinner on Saturday night and ordered the walnut chicken salad sandwich and after 3 bites  I didn't particularly like it.  That isn't the reason I am writing.  They offered me the option to order something else and I thought that was GREAT.  The Manager on duty Kristy Portillo couldn't be any nicer.

Also their sink in the ladies room was Cool."}
{"text":"We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and it was pretty packed due to the farmers market in the plaza.  We choose to sit at the bar to avoid the wait and sat immediately.  The bartop itself was pretty dirty but the real issue was the drink lists and menus: they were sticky and had crumbs on them.  We ordered 4 items, all described below.

Edamame- 3/5
Great flavors but they were really the smallest I have ever seen and many of the pods were empty.

Bacon egg mac and cheese 2/5
The flavors were ok but it was super small for $7.  It also was just very underwhelming and did not have much bacon or egg.

Havarti Turkey sandwich 1/5
Sandwich was dry, the bread was burnt and the fries had no seasoning.

Pork egg fried rice 3/5
The rice tasted ok but there wasn't much pork in it.

On the way out my friend and I used the restroom and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  There was little to no toilet paper, no hand soap and an overflowing trashcan."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!  Service was not the best, lemonade watered down, sangria was nasty!  No condiments on the table waited 15 min for water!   Supposed service dog inside restaurant!  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Why can't they have this restaurant in Michigan?!? My man and i came here for lunch before flying back to Detroit. They had $5 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas (I had both) and they were really good. The bloody mary mix, along with almost everything else on the menu are made in house. The menu is really cool, i loved the design and artwork on it. And the whole menu looked delicious, i wanted to try everything and i had a really hard time deciding what to order. Because i checked in on Yelp, we got a free order of cajun fries (which were really good). I ended up ordering the French Dip sandwich (it was delicious) and my man had the BBQ Bison Meatloaf (which was also pretty incredible). 

The design in the restaurant is really cool, a lot of dog themed stuff, which i love..because who doesn't love dogs??!?! They have a really cool fire hydrant beer tap at the bar too. OH and here's a little tip, they have a DOG MENU!!!! You are allowed to bring your dog if you sit on the patio and you can actually order dinner for your dog! How cool is that?!?! I mean it's genius! 

Our waiter, Jacob was so nice and knew a lot about the menu and the whole idea behind the restaurant, where they opened, how many locations and where they are located. He made sure to give us plenty of suggestions (at our request) and made sure to inform us that pretty much everything is made from scratch (which is also pretty amazing). Jacob was awesome!!!! And there was another gentleman who cleared our table and started chatting me up about the dog theme and then we started discussing our dogs and showing each other pictures of our dog babies. I mean, dogs bring people together! I love it! I will say that everyone that i encountered during my lunch here was SO friendly and had a great attitude! More restaurants need to take a lesson on customer service from this place and their staff!!!!! 

When we come back to Vegas, we will be coming back here. Maybe i'll get lucky and they will open one in Detroit?!?!?!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Been there 3 times already, the food is excellent, and they have very good beer. They are very reasonably priced to. Only complaint is the place is always packed."}
{"text":"We love their tortilla soup. Server was excellent...attentive and friendly. Ambiance was ok...... It could have been much better, but we were seated at a table where there was a ton of traffic and noise. Would recommend but request a booth away from the bar area."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch the game in Vegas stopped in to this place. Lots of tv's, friendly staff. The $5 bloody Mary was very good. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Bowl, it was very spicy and delicious. Noisy as you would expect a sports bar but not bad. Overall great place to watch a game, eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Great reasonable prices and good food. I ordered  chicken pizza it was a nice size, filled with all the toppings, they didn't skimp on any. Bread crust was soft yet crunchy even after day two. Would go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming a favorite of mine and my husband. We've yet to take our dog with us, but we will be doing that soon. That's what originally caught our attention being that we could bring our dog. Both times we have eaten there, it was on the patio and was delightful. We were surrounded by nice people and their dogs and we loved it. The fire pit area outside is just so nice! They have water and foods available for the dogs. I love the decor inside and out. Their drink menu has some interesting choices and my husband has found a new favorite drink (Jamaican something?). The food hasn't let us down. We've had the bison burger, nachos, fish and chips, and turkey meatballs. They were all fantastic. We can't wait for our next trip with our pup in tow. The staff, especially the front staff that greets everyone, are awesome. We've been to the Town Square and Downtown Summerlin locations, both. Everyone was very nice and genuine."}
{"text":"We came here last night on a whim with some friends. It was a nice night outside, so we chose the patio. Please note *animal cuteness overload!!* 

     It happened to be durning happy hour and there were a lot of really good items on the menu. For drinks, we settled on the dark horse Cabernet (great value on happy hour $4) and a pitcher of sangria ($15). Our friends ordered shots of Jameson. We requested our food be prepared vegan. We ordered the edamame, stir fry tofu and veggies, hummus trio, and Caramelized Brussell sprouts. Our friends ordered the ahi poke and chicken lettuce wraps. I received my drink pretty promptly. However, the shots and the sangria... Took over 15 min to come out. They hit the table with the edamame. The edamame... Now I love salty food... But this... It wasn't edible... Overly salted.  We actually sent it back:(. 

     The manager came out and let us know that The tofu is bathed in egg, but the Brussel sprouts could definitely be done with no butter and made vegan yay!!! We wound up canceling the stir fry and getting the veggie lavash with no cheese. Highly recommend. As the food was coming out, we noticed we were missing a few items and just thought it was taking a while. Well... A while turned into the end of our meal. We couldn't tell anyone because no one came back to check on the table. The server, although very sweet, seemed a little overwhelmed. There was an incident with an ambulance and a diner right next to us. Perhaps that threw him off his game a little bit. By the time we were able to tell him about the food, we were pretty much ready to go. Apparently the manager never communicated to him that the sprouts could be prepared vegan, so the order was never inputted and the hummus... I'm not sure exactly what happened to it. Not entirely his fault by any means. 

    Our experience here was unfortunately underwhelming. I'll probably be back for happy hour in the future... After they get it together a little more."}
{"text":"I'm beyond disappointed and irritated at Lazy Dog for the quality and quantity of food I've gotten the past TWO TIMES in a row! I eat at Lazy Dog easily a handful of times a month as I work next door in the mall so it's easy and convenient for me. The first time I went to pick up my food there was a missing item and I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for it to be made, so my food that I already had was cold by the time I got to eat it. I ordered a Caesar salad and was given maybe a spoonful of dressing for the entire salad. The second time was yesterday and I ordered the same lunch special and the salad this time AGAIN barely had any dressing along with there being half a salad to my order instead of a full like it was supposed to be! I refer so many of my clients to Lazy Dog on a daily basis, but after this I'm so irritated and disappointed with the lack of attention to detail that it's highly unlikely I will return myself."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, big menu, chain. I would give 2.5 stars I was all excited then went downhill after the food.  I would not waste my money again. I got the Black N Blue Burger, My friend Steak, another Spicy Burger. The taste was ok to good and cold. A fly flew around us and on top of our plates (not their fault he wandered in?) I was excited seeing it  has four stars but then disappointed. If the burger can be hot would be way better. Steak seemed pretty good. We also got pumpkin cheesecake, I wouldn't pay for this again, ok flavor great crust. Ginger Beer Woa Nelly Horrible tasted like ginger and soda water. Waitress was friendly but slow. Don't come when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was amazing!!! Our bartender Ashley was so attentive and friendly.  Ashley made some suggestions and we tried them. Just one was not our cup of tea. The calamari was not one we would try again. However, the sauce was exceptional!! They knew I didn't care for it and immediately took it off our check and let us order something new. We were greeted by one of the managers \"Lolo\" and she was kind enough to apologize and offer something else. This is rare in Vegas!! The people here are great, friendly, attentive and honestly I could go on and on.
This is a must try!! We will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"My dad came to town for the weekend and my aunt suggested Lazy Dog for lunch. The outside seating they have is nice and convenient for bringing your pup to eat with you. The food was delicious and I already have in mind what I want to order next time! I'll definitely be referring this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We lived this place when it first opened.  The food was amazing however now that theyve changed the menu, its not as appealing as it once was.  Wish theyd bring back some of the original menu."}
{"text":"My colleague and I travel to Vegas frequently for work, and we often find ourselves on the search for a good happy hour spot before heading to the airport for our late flight home. We have gone to Lazy Dog twice now. The first time we were able to make it in time for happy hour, which has great drink and small plate deals! The first time we had the ahi poke jars, and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was really tasty. It had something on it that had a bit of a bite to it! The ahi poke jars were ok. If you are really into ahi poke this would likely not cut it for you. We both found the flavor to be underwhelming. 

On our second visit we missed happy hour so we ordered off the regular menu. I had the mahi mahi tacos, and sampled some of my colleague's brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were out of this world! They are rich so eating a whole order of them to yourself might take a lot. But I am sure that those around you would love to help you eat them. The mahi mahi tacos were disappointing. The fish was dry (overcooked) and bland. I would not order these again. Overall, I think that things are hit and miss here. They have some really great menu items, and some that are just ok. Perhaps I should have prepared better and read some of the other Yelp reviews to help me decide :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Phil McMaster, Brenda and Kati for making our dinner exceptional with the great service you provided! One of our favorite local restaurants to go to for brunch and for dinner, especially for our kids! Please bring back the Corn Wheels!!  xoxo"}
{"text":"My husband and I will not be coming back here. It was my husbands birthday and he ordered the pulled pork Sandwich and got food poisoning the next day. Luckily it wasn't me who got food poisoning because, I am pregnant and could have lost my baby. Fair warning if your meal comes out 3 minuets after you order send it back!! I ordered the chicken parm it should not only take 3 minuets to cook that!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner and everything was excellent! My boyfriend had the seasonal sampler- three different types of 8 ounce draft beers and I had the pink lemon drop martini and then a blueberry lemon drop. Yummy :) boyfriend had the Bison meatloaf and mashed which was DELICIOUS- -too bad it's seasonal. Our server Amy had great recommendations, I had the black and blue pizza, so good. Sweet from the caramelized onions and salty from the bacon. Service was awesome even though she was super busy, she still did GREAT! Positive attitude and made sure everything was perfect! Terry and Phil were both very friendly and accommodating! We look forward to returning:)"}
{"text":"Overall this is a cool place. The ambiance is nice and the staff was exceptionally friendly. The idea that dogs can sit outside is kinda cool (I'm not a dog owner) as it would be fun to watch the doggies interact with each other while having a cocktail. As for the food, it's good. I had the sunny side up brunch pizza (white sauce, spinach with eggs) and it was good. My friend has the baby kale and hazelnut salad and he really liked it.  My only gripe is the Cajun fries (free with Yelp check in) were so incredibly salty that you could actually see mountains of seasoning salt piled up on them. Way way overkill, I ate only a few and had to stop (I did not complain as they were free). I'm sure our server noticed we barely touched them but he didn't comment.  I suggest ordering them with no seasoning and dipping them in regular ketchup, they would be much better. Overall I will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere - anything dog themed is A OK in my book. I live in Austin where restaurants are very pet friendly, so it was nice to see a hang out in Vegas where people bring their dogs (side note: it's been a cool June for Vegas, it's great to sit outside with the dogs!)

I had the ahi tuna sandwich...which would have been delicious although I somehow overlooked the Wasabi part on the menu...it was so spicy steam was coming out of my nose. Ce LA vie, the coconut mojito was delish (and low calorie!)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always get a great service here. My go to dish is rice bowl with tofu. Delicious! I just wish they had more vegan options though."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Pretty cool can bring your dog here. Have some local brews on menu which is always a plus. Unfortunately their customer service lacks. My family asked for a booth and the host told us they didn't have any as he walks us to table next to 4 empty booths. Ok maybe big party or something coming but he doesn't give us reason why couldn't sit there so who knows. Not even 5 minutes later the booths are now all sat with regular customers like myself. 

Fried chicken sandwich was crappy dark meat that was like jerky. Probably won't be back after that. Quality of food is not great"}
{"text":"A very good experience with wonderful tasting food.  We tried the Wing sampler and was excellent, three sauces from buffalo, bbq and some type of ranch.   My dinner consisted of  crispy bbq ribs with fries with a umami saurce.  The service was very good also."}
{"text":"We ate inside.  Burgers were great--but the butter cake dessert was SO GOOD.  I will be going back.  Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"We went here on our standard Friday lunch venture and we were not disappointed.  We had the Calamari and the Hummus as an appetizer.  The Calamari was steak that had been cut in strips and was served with a sweet syrupy sauce. It was good.  The Hummus came with 3 separately flavored scoops (Walnut ,Sun dried tomato and traditional) with a healthy portion of flatbread. The corn wheels were fun. The Hummus was very well done.  She ordered the fish and chips which was very generous and I had the Ahi tuna salad.  Very good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I came in with three of my closest friends after we watched The movie Black Panther. 
It was just about 10 pm and Happy Hour. When we walked in we sat our selfs. I wasn't sure if that's what we were supposed to do but we did it anyway. Our server came over and greeted us and offered to get us something to drink. She was very friendly, fast and efficient. 
This is definitely the first time coming and was surprised to see that you could bring your dogs if you choose to. I personally don't have a dog but it's great for those who do. 
My friend kept saying you have to try the Mac and cheese and requested an order for all of us to try. It was so good I was sad I didn't order one for myself ( next time for sure ) 
I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with pimento cheese and seasonal fruit ( which was a big chunk of watermelon) I asked for the pickled jalapeños and carrots on the side, and I'm so glad I did. The sandwich was huge and very fulfilling. 
The service was great the food was amazing, I can't wait to share this place with my wife."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a yardhouse or BJs. Food served here is an all American yet food flavors of Mexican to Asian dishes. Come here if you and your party can't decide on what to eat; there is something for everyone! Food seemed ok, we went for happy hour and got the famous \"lazy dog\" knife and fork hot dog, chicken nachos, and our free cajun fries. We spent $20 that's including the tip, not bad. 

The service was good until he forgot to put all sauces on the side so they had to make a new hot dog (which they charged us for 2, but I made sure they took it off the bill) , didn't check up on us really, and no refills! No refills in my book means ehh ok your service is failing. He seemed like a nice guy , but I was expecting better service from a new spot like this. 

I'll give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Lively atmosphere, but not too loud. Very clean. Pot roast was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were great. I wish more restaurants offered watermelon as a side because it was great...very sweet. The beer was perfect temp and carbonation. The waiter was friendly and attentive. Will definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple locations. Our food is always great and they treat our dog like family. I especially like the chicken fried chicken. Great selection of beer on tap. I go with the Lazy Dog IPA. We love the Patio!"}
{"text":"Christine Winter is the best server I have EVER had.  She is amazing at her job.  Definitely request her when you go in.  She will take care of you!"}
{"text":"The food here was really just honestly okaaaay . There Asian chicken salad wasn't  really the best so I don't know what these reviewers were talking about yall let me down cause my salad low key sucked ! there brick pizza was so gross and there nachos were even worse . I mean I might come back to try other stuff on the happy hour  menu if this was my last resort  hopefully it's better but at this rate I doubt it but hey my server was so nice and my drinks were always refilled so I guess that's a plus"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars all because they cater to dogs and my baby girl (Snookie) deserves all the catering she can get. I really wanted to take her out for her bday and this place was awesome. They have a doggy menu that included a hamburger patty or chicken breast with brown or white rice. How cute is that?!!! Our server was a awesome! Right away he took our orders and brought my doggy a bowl of water. Le boyfriend had the black and blue burger and he said it was really good. I had their Caribbean chicken and it was good nothing amazing. Le boyfriend also had their buffalo chicken nuggets and they were really tasty. Over all I can't wait to go back again with my pup. She had a great time and to top it off the weather was perfect."}
{"text":"We went in opening night which we did not realize til we got there. I normally do not like going to eat when a place just opens but we were happily surprised at how great the service was and the food was delicious!  Kids got to make their own pizza and the Hummus appetizer was amazing! Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had an exceptional waitress something close to jennifer. She kept all our drinks full and everyone happy all night. The food was good and the inside was great all night 

Had the black and blue cheese burger it was great with the sweet potato tots and then got the cajun fries for happy hour which was from 9:00 pm to 12:00 pm.

Went with a work group was a great time overall the waitress deserved a raise she make everything amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, beer, atmosphere, and they allow dogs (on the patio). And a solid happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome menu, and you can go there with your dog. What's not to like. Glad they are adding a new one in Roseville area soon. That will be a regular stop for sure."}
{"text":"Good beer, nice outside area for humans and dogs and great location make this a perfect happy hour spot in Summerlin."}
{"text":"My first and last time here. Came here with co-workers for breakfast. Took them 30 minutes to get us seated and then they just forgot about us. We had to call the host twice and remind them we're here. Ordered my food an hour ago and still waiting..."}
{"text":"My managers actually introduced me and my husband to this restaurant. We came here for the soft opening a couple weeks back and fell in love with the place! The staff is quick, very nice, and are always ready for a good time ! So far all the dishes we've tasted have been delicious! As an app I suggest the chipotle chicken quesadilla! The pastas are delicious the steaks are delicious everything has such a fresh taste. My managers husband is co owner of lazy dog and he is always in a great mood along with all his staff. You will always feel welcomed here especially your doggies. Dogs can lounge outdoor in patio seating. It's in a great area as well. ! I can go on and on about this place! Go check out this awesome SoCal originated restaurant !"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is in a great location, it has an amazing, comfortable and beautifully designed building. But let's start talking about what matters, their food. I have Lazy Dog 4 starts for a reason, obviously, so let me explain it for you in a feel lines.

Their food was good, their drinks were amazing, but I feel like they did not have many dishes in their menu that would justify 5 stars, for example: 

-No truffle Fries
-No File minion
- no picanha  
-No Sushi  

So, with the competition around them, being around many trendy good restaurants at Downtown Summerlin, it pushes Lazy Dog to improve their menu. It's not just about having a 6 million dollars building with an expansive kitchen and good service, it's about food!

So, Lazy Dog is a very good option for large groups and very hungry and thirsty people. However, I feel like they would benefit from improving their menu a little bit. In addition, I feel like they should have an amazing hot dog there since the name of the place is Lazy Dog, but they dong!

Thus, Lazy Dog is a true 4 stars restaurant with great potential to reach 5 stars, like they are really, really close from getting that 5 stars from me. Just gotta add those truffle fries and a couple of options for sushi like a Temaki or a jalapeños yellowtail sashimi!"}
{"text":"Excelente bar restaurante a pesar de que abrieran hace 2 días todo muy lindo y acogedor dentro y fuera del restaurant. La atención es muy buena por parte de los meseros y bartender. Los invito a parar en el Town Square de Las Vegas y llegar aquí"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Drinks are very good as well.  The best part is I don't have to worry others looking at me like I am crazy because I am the only one bring dog to the restaurant.  By the way, birds are flying around inside the patio area, so if you cannot stand that then don't go there."}
{"text":"First time dining here for me. Birthday dinner for a good friend. Six of us total. Great experience overall minus a very odd encounter with a management type after we were seated and before we saw our waiter. First the good then the odd. Arrived without a reservation. Waited close to an hour for a table - but that's all good - It's a Saturday night on the Island of Las Vegas. Not a bad wait outside the patio area watching people and their dogs. When we were finally seated (this is where the encounter with the management person happened - but more on that later).  When our waiter finally made an appearance after a bit of a wait he was excellent. Terrific all through the dinner. His name was/is BJ and I was very impressed by his demeanor and service. After going over a few items (my first time - I never know what to order) he suggested the Bison meatloaf. Great suggestions. Excellent. Not as good as my wife's but for restaurant meatloaf it was close to that level. Came with very good mashed potatoes. My wife had a roasted chicken sandwich which she gave a big thumbs up to. My daughter is vegan and she had some kind of a veggie burger as did another in our party. Both said it was terrific. Mother-in-law had the Tex-Mex salad and she was happy - and as long as my wife AND my mother-in-law are happy - I'm happy. Finally, the birthday girl had a grilled cheese. Grilled cheese? I can't figure that out - but she liked it. 

I ordered the banana pudding for desert - something you don't see often on menus. Very good. Our wonderful waiter, BJ, brought over a big slice of their butter cake with ice cream on it and some other stuff. Superb. And of course; he had a candle on it. Right after taking our desert order, BJ did something that really impressed me. He saw that I had my credit card off to the side, kind of hiding it. My plan was to pay for dinner before the birthday girl's husband could reach for the check, which he ALWAYS does. I asked BJ where the restroom was - hoping to see him off to the side when I returned so I could tell him about the birthday girl and give him my credit card before he brought the check. He was very attentive and very sharp - he replied, \"I'll show you where it's at, sir...the directions are little tricky.\" Well - he had actually intuited that I wanted to pay the bill and got me away from the table very discreetly. \"I thought that was your intention!\" he said. That was impressive. 

Now the odd part. After were first seated in a booth we were all very thirsty after waiting in the sun for almost an hour. Now, under these circumstances, five minutes can seem like an hour. But at least 10 minutes passed and no one came by our booth to inquire if we wanted water or drinks or anything at all. It was a bit too long for such a quick and simple check-in. Finally, the hostess walked by and I got her attention. \"Excuse me, could we please get some water.\" She seemed like she was caught off guard and just mumbled \"Sure\".  A moment later another lady, who I found out later was named Carrie - and was a management type - came over and abruptly said \"I understand there is a problem?\" The way she said it and the timing was very uncomfortable. I'm thinking 'what the heck?'. I was about to say \"What do you mean, 'problem'?\" when, just then, a busboy came up with a tray of waters. Carrie realized that I was saying we just wanted water and she kind of laughed and said \"Ask and you shall receive.\" I wasn't exactly laughing. It was odd. What did the hostess say to her? \"Hey Table XXXXX has a problem, can you speak with them\"???? You would think she would just let someone know there were some thirsty customers patiently waiting. Thank goodness for BJ."}
{"text":"Had the crispy Brussels sprouts and butter cake with strawberry sauce. Was off the charts!.  Finished with coffee which I am really picky about and it was top notch. Service was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry....concept is great but just plain ole bar food quality. 
I wanted to love it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best comfortable bar stools in Summerlin. Food is ok. Great bar. Excellent service from Shannah  and Brendon..."}
{"text":"Service was really good, food not so much! VERY disappointed! I had a veggie omelet that tasted like fish & was mush! The hash brown was a greasy patty, appeared to be a frozen patty that was cooked in oil! Was also cold! Second time I've eaten here & was a disappointment, especially since I was told how great the food is. 2 for 2, not going back!"}
{"text":"If you want mediocre food and beverages with a snails pace service this joint is for you.  Poorly managed restaurant that tasked our group of 30 with one waitress.  Apps came out cold and late which pushed back the main course delivery.  The slow service and serving randomly dinner entrees throughout the group killed the night.  Our group won't be back."}
{"text":"Good off-the-strip (Las Vegas) family and friends eatery. Nicely decorated interior with pleasant ambiance. Attentive service by Shawnae. 

The carmelized Brussel sprouts, shrimp tacos, campfire pot roast were remarkable. 

The Brussel sprouts were served mixed with capers, oil and Parmesan cheese. They were nicely seasoned and a delight. 

The flavor of the shrimp tacos was exceptional, served seasonally hot and spicy. 

The pot roast was melt-in-your-mouth tender with good flavor and accompanied by creamed potatoes, spinach, and was resting on a small pond of gravy. This is comfort food at its best.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday, and I wasn't impressed. 

If you go, don't be in a hurry. It took well over 45 minutes to get our food, and the restaurant wasn't that busy.  They say everything is made fresh. The children's macaroni and cheese looked like it came straight out of a Kraft box. My Crusted Ahi Tuna came from the freezer and left behind color and flavor.  

There are plenty of other gems in Town Square. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! All the food is good. Plenty on draft and of course your 4 legged friends are invited as well. We have yet to bring ours just because we really want to enjoy our food, ha!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great staff, great food!! Sous Chef, Mark Ramirez, answered every question I had, was extremely helpful, accommodating, friendly, and very knowledgeable. I ordered take out for the first time today, I usually eat there, and the staff was so helpful, offered to carry the food out to my car, the food, as always, was delicious, an all around great experience!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and we will be back again. Although, the service is slower than normal, even with no customers, their friendly and knowledgeable staff make up for it. I wouldn't recommend this place if you have plans for afterwards because you'll never know what time you'll actually leave. 
We're typical so, we tried their favorite dishes : the Bleu Burger with Sweet Potato Tater Tots and the Sundried Tomato Pasta w/ Chicken. I wanted to try their dessert but, we had plans and that might've taken possibly another hour. They gave samples on the beer and as I said before, very knowledgeable about everything. Great atmosphere, perfect for singles, couples, groups, families ... you name it! We will be back again... of course, when we have nothing else planned"}
{"text":"Good bar - good food and drink selection. Enjoyed the lemon caper chicken pasta and IPA. Nice to be able to see inside from the outside - too many dark, invisible bars in Las Vegas that turn out to be empty of full of undesirables once you go in."}
{"text":"I know it can take a business some time to get up and running so I am trying to be fair in my review.  We visited twice this week; both kind of \"off-peak\" times and on both occasions our food was delivered late and cold.  The first visit was a Sat. at 11 am.  Our table of 3 all ordered breakfast items.  My two dining companions had almost finished their entrees before mine even arrived.  The staff recognized the issue and deducted my entree from the bill.  Our second visit was a Sat. afternoon at 4.  We waited almost 30 min for our entrees to arrive ( burgers) and then they arrived barely warm.  Again, the management recognized we had been waiting too long and offered a free dessert.  The food is fine, the atmosphere upbeat but don't go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Had Thai chicken salad.  Very yummy   Went with 3 girlfriends and everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"I hated this place. The food was unedible and for my fat arse to say that is really saying something. 

Unedible: I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The seasoning or sauce was off. I didn't taste any vinegar or tomato or spice. I tasted fat. Lard. Butter. Bland, fatty meat sandwich. The bun was the only thing winning about it. That was until a fucking bug flew on my plate and landed on my bun. A type of fruit fly or something all up in my business. Just great. My dining partner had the Chicken Parm which completely fell flat as well. Maybe we ordered off the dog menu or something. 

Speaking of dogs that's the only thing I like about this lazy place. Dog doors, dog theme, dogs can dine with you outside. I think they would be much better off turning this into a full on dog restaurant and dog park. The dogs would have a hard time writing reviews about their experience though. Dogs are so real so they would write bad reviews for this place, too I bet. 

Overall I will not be fining here again. I believe this restaurant fell under the Yelpers free event equals shiny reviews category. Clearly I don't play for that team. Hated it!"}
{"text":"Our server Matthew took care of 40 person party like a pro. After a long day at a softball tournament, we reserved some tables here. 7pm on a Saturday. Almost all the food came out at the same time. A true compliment to the kitchen. Matthew ensured we were taken care of and made great recommendations. I would recommend the meatloaf dish and the butter cake strawberry dessert."}
{"text":"Came in after a long day of shopping hungry and very thirsty! I loved that they have Banger Brewing on draft and that they support local breweries like Tenaya Creek & Joseph James. Got the tuna poke and caesar as an app and a burger. Everything was so good! Tasted a few different beers and loved them all. Our bartender, Terry, made the experience. Can't wait to go back and see her!"}
{"text":"Food really good ...Nicole Hees was our server very happy and content with my service my food and my experience"}
{"text":"I had a birthday party of 15 guests.  At first the service was good, but then the server just disappeared!  Water glasses went empty, we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, and we were never asked for coffee, which we would've wanted!  So what's the deal?  I usually sit outside.  Is the service worse inside?"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I have nothing bad to say... The first time, we were impressed with our brunch items and tonight, I'm even more happy we chose to eat here again! the food was soo good! Tonight we ordered the Hawaiian sticky ribs, ahi burger, pot roast, hush puppies, and sweet potato tater tots and all of it was delicious!!! and our drinks were on point! We had the peach moonshine, pineapple Mojito, sangria sampler, and the Jamaican lemonade! I honestly have nothing bad to say as of right now! And prices are very reasonable!  everything from food, drinks, to service was great! We're definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas!  Food is excellent!  

Our server got a little preoccupied and took 35+ minutes to get our food (2 burgers with fries).  The manager happened to be walking around greeting customers and we inquired about the delay.  I think her name was Brook.  She personally handled our service from that point on.  She brought us an excellent queso dip and chips, then shortly returned with our order.  Brook covered our costs and even offered us dessert on the house.  We were so full from the meal, we had to pass on the desert. They made every attempt to make sure our visit went as good as possible from that point on, and it was.  

I understand mishaps can happen from time to time, but the Staff at The Lazy Dog went above and beyond to correct the small issue.  We will be returning for more great food!"}
{"text":"Our server was a complete jerk. He came to our table with an attitude! No greetings just, \"So what's your order?\" My husband says, \"I'd like a tea, no lemon\" our servers answer was \"what? I'm not here to take that order\" My husband and I thought maybe we should leave then...anyway we ordered and our food took forever to get out then it  tasted old like it had been sitting....I love french fries and it was cold and soggy. This server never came back to check on us but so weird... this server seemed to be good with everyone else, but with us.... our food wasn't touched, he didnt bother to ask how everything was, still with an irritating attitude, he threw our bill on the table to me and not even asked if we needed refills on our drinks....mind you, this was our 1st time at this establishment that has descent reviews......never walking into this place again...I'd rather go to Dicks Last Resort if I wanted to be treated like this...and had better food."}
{"text":"Ronnie was great! The food was simply delicious and the beer sampler was the best, but not as good as the coconut Mojito. I love coming here it's the best. Can't wait to bring my canines to enjoy this place with me. Thanks Ronnie! Your the best. See you next time."}
{"text":"Just checked another restaurant on our Downtown Summerlin To Do list.
Arrived for a late lunch and the restaurant was doing a brisk business. Given the choice of seating we chose a booth near the kitchen. In advance it looked to be a little quieter then the seating closer to the bar. And it was. The dining space is large but separated by half height walls. The decor the a nice mix of wood and steel. Wall art is a combination of dog photos and metal sculptures of various animals. The background music was not loud enough to interfere with our conversation. The restaurant and bar is well lit by large windows on two walls

Our server Daria greeted us and asked if this was our first visit. She extended a warm welcome and offered to answer any questions.

The menu has many choices both for dinner and lunch. After receiving our drinks a large round flatbread cut into 8 slices arrived at our table. Daria explained that it was a complementary welcome starter for our first visit. The flatbread is made to order with garlic and Parmesan cheese. It was very tasty and filling.. Enough left over to bring home. 
The general manager Phil stopped by the table and extended us his personal welcome to the Lazy Dog family.
 
The entrees selected were the Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl and  All-American Burger
Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl contains chopped chicken breast on top of Spanish rice and shredded cabbage, served with avocado, black beans, hatch chiles, jack and cheddar cheeses, house made salsa and fresh cilantro. This is a lunch special and is large enough to serve as a dinner entree. The flavors were fresh and delicious.
The All American Burger is two charbroiled quarter-pound beef patties layered with melted American Cheese and topped with shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles and a large mound of french fries on the side. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and had a great beef flavor. The fries were firm and  UN greasy. In order to get through the burger some of the large bun had to be sacrificed.
We look forward to a return to sample the Happy Hour menu which begins at 3 PM and can be a Late Late lunch and an Early Early dinner."}
{"text":"Great place and love the food.  This was my second visit today and the service was a little slow but the atmosphere and food are worth it.  I enjoyed sitting outside and dining with the fur children.   It's great there is a place for dog lovers to bring their fur child, relax and grab a drink and bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great patio setting for us and our four legged family members. And they have our favorite brew El Heffe, back on the menu. Thank you and well done!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great patio setting for us and our four legged family members. And they have our favorite brew El Heffe, back on the menu. Thank you and well done!"}
{"text":"We love it here! We bring our pup Wayne multiple times per month, usually for brunch on weekends or for happy hour. We love their menu, the awesome beer selection, and obviously the fact that we can bring Wayne. The staff are always so nice and give Wayne so much love. It's a great place to catch a game, and the manager on the patio Tony is next-level with customer service. We always feel welcomed and have never had a negative experience or bad meal here, through 15+ visits. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is terrible. Waited about 39 minutes for my second glass of wine"}
{"text":"Dogs are only allowed on the patio, not indoors. The food was great, all the dogs we saw were very well behaved, and my little chi enjoyed herself so much we'll definitely bring her back - just not till the weather cools down."}
{"text":"Based on my personal experience... Lazy Dog is a great place to eat if you want to yell while conversing with the person sitting across from you at the same table. An added bonus is the people around you are also raising their voices because the music is so LOUD. So you get to hear all the conversations around you. On blast.

When I asked the hostess who gave us our table if the music is always this loud she responded with, \"pardon me\" and moved closer to hear my question. She shared she doesn't have any control over the sound system.  So if a loud restaurant environment is something you enjoy, you may love the Lazy Dog."}
{"text":"Will never be back. Went to try a new pet friendly restaurant. We sat on the patio with our well behaved cat who has no problem with dogs. Dallan was in his stroller and nothing happened while we were there. We were rudely kicked out just because he wasn't a dog. We went across town square to Brio and they welcomed him and us with no issues. This place sucks.

In response to Chris: I call BS. Dallan since Friday has gone with me to Grape Street Cafe, Brio Tuscan Grille, and Egg Works. All on patios with other dogs in his stroller no issues at any other place. Your own rules state dogs are not to be in laps or chairs yet that was happening at the table next to us and we were the ones kicked out, and Dallan was in a stroller no bugging anyone, not causing a scene, etc. Again, BS!"}
{"text":"Love hanging out here with my dog park friends! Good food, good music, and your dog can join in the fun."}
{"text":"Not impressed. (Be careful if you can't have gluten)

The service was---weird. Staff was really friendly and welcoming. BUT it was just odd that we constantly had people coming by and checking on us. I'm all for attentive service but we could barely have a conversation because someone was coming by every few minutes to see how we were. The hostess seated us and then we had two different waiters taking orders, and two other staff coming by just to check on us. It went from \"this is really nice\" to \"leave us alone already\".  We also had several staff walk by the table and simply stare. We were seated right near the kitchen which would account for all the traffic, I guess. But the staring was very unsettling. It was just odd. 

Food--everyone enjoyed their food. No one raved about it. Everyone in our party of five agreed there were better places to eat. But the food wasn't terrible or anything. 

However--I have a complaint with their gluten free menu. I do not have Celiac's but I do have autoimmune thyroid disease and have a gluten sensitivity that can severely exacerbate symptoms. So, I'm as careful as can be. I was really happy they had a menu catering to those who are gluten free. 

I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and the Japanese cucumber salad. All of these are listed on the GF menu. So, the waiter comes back to the table to inform me that they cannot serve me the cucumber salad because it comes with sesame seeds so it is not gluten free. ????  Sesame seeds are not gluten. They should pose no problem. And if they do, why is the salad even listed on the GF menu and what is hard about leaving the sesame seeds off the salad?  But I make a point not to argue with the people making my food so I just opted for the fruit instead. Imagine my confusion when they bring out my salmon and it is covered in sesame seeds. It was also covered in some kind of asian ginger sauce. Most asian sauces do have gluten. The GF menu did not mention any kind of sauce in the description. I waited until the waiter came back over to check on us and asked him if he was sure this was a gluten free item because of the sauce. He assured me that the salmon was gluten free. 

I ate it but shouldn't have. Later that night I was severely ill and have had the usual symptoms I get when getting \"glutened\".  Yes, this is partially on me because I should have trusted my instincts; especially when they refused to bring me a salad with sesame seeds because they are supposedly gluten but then bring me a salmon covered in sesame seeds and tell me it is GF.  I do think if they are going to offer gluten free items though, they need to better train their staff. I'm pretty sure they were not supposed to include the ginger sauce on the salmon--a soy sauce that most likely contains wheat. 

The third star is because I seriously enjoyed the cucumber thyme lemonade."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now,  always sit at the bar.  Food has been great every time.  I have tried the Brussels Sprouts,  Wok Fried Chicken Kung Paper bowl,   Sicilian Turkey Meatballs,  Sweet and Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl and they all were great.  Service at the bar is very down to earth,  super friendly,  a real good place with a great vibe.  Pet friendly patio is cool too,  and huge patio,  probably 30 tables out there,  loaded with dogs..."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time on April 30. Forsure will not return. Don't have time it.

Food 3.5/5
Chose a beer and appetizers, I should have got a burger because definitely not good decision. Got sin city say hello to Amber pint. HORRIBLE do not get this it taste like dirty water. Definitely should be replaced. I ordered loaded potato hush puppies. Which were awesome side dish moist potato and bacon taste. Good enough to share. Also Japanese cucumber salad. Which was just a bunch of cucumber wish Asian dressing nothing amazing. My friends say the burgers were exceptional tho. 

Service 1/5
This is why I will not return. We were at a booth right behind a p.o.s. Which at any given time had 2 to 6 workers around it. After we received our food we were checked up on once with a water refill at that time. Then we finished our meal eventually. For a minimum of about 20 minutes we sat there with finished plates waiting.... And waiting .... And waiting. As at any given time with no lapse there was 2 to 6 workers standing 2 feet away. I eventually spoke up to one of the servers for checks. Which he basically said ok and told another server not even coming over to our table. Our waiter spent most of this 20 minutes at another table about 8 feet away from us having a convo with a couple. She came over once this happened. We asked for checks and boxes. She brought checks. Which we immediately had cash and card ready. Yet we waited another 5 to 7 minutes while there is still minimum 4 servers standing 2 feet away. Our checks obviously ready and standing. She came back took our checks. Cashed out and returned with all but 1 check which was 3 dollar change but she assumed it was tip. AND no box. We waited another 5 minutes or so before announcing to the group of about 3/4 servers we need a box. Finally got our box and was able to leave. The restaurant was less than half full, over staffed and yet had no attention from any server.

There is a reason it is called lazy dogs
Lazy workers. 

For the most part it's pretty much a yard house. Save your self the trouble and go to yard house. At least until they train their workers properly and have management team that keeps their workers busy."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, atmosphere is great, probably the best food in this area of town!

As a dog lover, you want to be a backer of this place prior to even arriving, however, it steps up to the plate in all aspects. We've had excellent service every time we've gone.

We frequent here often and this is a must stop for our families when they come into town from the Midwest!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where if you ask me how it was ill say \"it was whatever\" nothing too special about it. 

Came in with an old friend to catch up during happy hour. The happy hour deals are really good and make it a decent place. It was packed. 

First we got a pitcher of the white peach sangria to share. Too sweet for my taste but I was definitely feeling a little tipsy by the end. I'd maybe try another flavor if I were to return. 

We ended up ordering from the happy hour menu 
Hawaiian ahi poke: served on little chips, nothing too special about it 
Garlic flatbread: again nothing too memorable. 
Inside out quesadilla: most interesting item. Quesadilla with cheese also on the outside and grilled. Pretty good. 
Spicy buffalo chicken nuggets: my favorite item that we ordered. Full of flavor and cute presentation with little sticks in them. Yum. 

Overall it was a decent place but nothing too great about it. We also couldn't find our waitress for a long time to get our check so that was slightly annoying."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a new place for lunch! So glad we tried Lazy Dog ! They had great specials for lunch! The lentil soup was delicious! My half sandwich and half salad fantastic and the total bill was $ 14  fir both of us! The staff was very friendly and very eager to please ! The staff kept filling us up with fresh fries and more soup! Will definitely go again! We even had a drink at the bar on the way out and the bartender was so gracious! We had so much fun with her! This is our new place now for lunch!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place three stars, but added a star because of how dog friendly they are. It's just nice to see a place in town that does cater to people with dogs, with a big patio that is dog friendly. There was quite a bit of people waiting with their dogs to be seated on the patio, which was fun to see. And while I didn't LOVE this place, I would return with my dog as I think she would like it there. This restaurant is just OK. Given all of the other amazing dining options we have in town, I'm just not sure this is a place I'd want to return to again and again. Got the tuna poke for the appetizer, which was good. Then I ordered the pesto chicken with hummus salad, which was just ok and honestly something I could have gotten at an Applebee's. There is just nothing particularly amazing or different about the menu selections or quality of food to make this place stand out. Again, I would have given it a 3, but any place that is dog friendly makes me more of a fan ..."}
{"text":"Loved, loved,loved it.
Delicious food, pleasant atmosphere, friendly, attentive staff........
I truly couldn't ask for more.
We're here from out of town and have our little girl (furry 4 legged) and didn't want to leave her in the room, she's on vacay too.........
So, anyhoo.......this was a great experience and next time we're in town we'll be back......highly recommend.
Thank you, lazy dog.
GOOD restaurant......stay.......who's a good restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance & I have been here very frequently now and absolutely love it! I love that we can bring our furry baby out to dinner too but we have yet to take her. We happened to come here when it was happy hour & the happy hour appetizers were really big portions! We liked the potato balls & calamari &  chicken nachos as appetizers. The fiance always gets the pot roast while I usually get the hawaiian sticky ribs or the bbq ribs. We have also tried the fish &  chips that I enjoyed and as for dessert we always have to have the strawberry butter cake!!!! Melt in your mouth deliciousness! What's nice about this place is they have a gluten free menu upon request as well as a menu for the furry babies!! And the doggies are only allowed out on the patio but that's perfectly alright because they've got other friends to keep them company. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new additions to Summerlin. Been here a few times already. The decor and ambiance is like no other. Very unique and clean. The menu is tremendous and the staff is super friendly and personable every time. I can definitely tell that the managers here interview well due to the consistently awesome bartenders and waitresses. Fabulous happy hour as well with beautiful outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Stop by because they allow the dog. My experience was good. I only had a champagne and sweet potatoes tots. My dog had chicken and brown rice. It's good to be able to enjoy afternoon together"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give Lazy Dog a try tonight, and I'm glad we did! 
I had the teriyaki bowl with chicken and my husband got the barbecue bacon cheeseburger. We also shared the queso dip. All of the food was awesome and super fresh. I loved how crispy the chips were that came with the queso dip. 
For dessert I had the butter cake and hubs got the brownie. Our only mistake was thinking that we could finish them-they are definitely a share size! The butter cake was so good. I was stuffed and yet I didn't want to stop eating. The strawberry compote tasted just like the strawberry sauce my Mom put on pound cake growing up. It was amazing. My husband loved his brownie as well but we will definitely share a dessert next time. We had two servers helping us (as one seemed to be a trainee) and they both did an awesome job and were super attentive. We had a great experience. We can't wait to come back and bring our pups out on the patio when it's a little cooler!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and server was awesome. Sara was on top of it. And everybody was smiling having a great time. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The only reason you should come here is if you have a dog and want to sit outside and eat with your pet. Bad service, nothing special with the food, and Summerlin prices. It is very dog friendly on the patio and has 2 tvs which is nice if you want to watch a game, but I would never come back unless I brought my dog."}
{"text":"I mean it's ok.  Just like any other restaurant and bar.  The service today was ok.  The food was mediocre.  The drinks were WEAK! Sangria...all juice and lime.  Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Uninspired food if they even get the order right.  Waitresses are slow, not very bright, and not well trained.  I probably won't go back unless made to. Why people love this faux-applebees is beyond me."}
{"text":"Our family had tried Lazy Dog at Downtown Summerlin and we loved it. When we went to the Town Square location, we were not disappointed. It was also good and met our expectations. Of course, don't forget to check in to get try their yummy fries!"}
{"text":"My Hubby and I had an impromptu lunch date yesterday. We decided to go to Downtown Summerlin and try a restaurant we haven't eaten before. Good thing Yelp is here to guide us to this awesome restaurant. Food portions were generous! Once you checked in via Yelp you'll get a good for 4 Cajun Fries...and it was good! Complimentary flat bread was also given which was very nice. So before our main dish came in we were already full! I had a delish chicken parmesan and my husband had capers. Yummy! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This is perfect for what it is. If your friends like Chili's and Friday's, then this is a step up but with the same relaxed spirit. It is cool that you can bring your dog, and their menu of diet cocktails is impressive."}
{"text":"Super cute concept! The food was good but to be honest I just loved that I could get my sweet doggy a meal of her own. She had chopped chicken with rice and loved every bit of it! I had the nachos which were good as well. I am looking forward to coming back !"}
{"text":"The three of us went here for the first time on Sunday 6/28.2015. I am giving three stars because the service was slow, the restaurant was insanely loud, and the food is good but not outstanding in any way. As far as service was concerned, this was half be served experience and half serve yourself. There were sharing plates on the table which I like because it makes one less thing for a server to forget. Sadly though, we did not have any utensils. My dad had to get up and walk to a bus station to grab some. They were busy so no biggie... But we also had to help ourselves to pepper. (hence the serve yourself comment)

We all ordered an alcoholic drink. I had the sangria sampler...not worth ever ordering a glass. They were all boring. The presentation was cute though. We had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were excellent. We each ordered an entree. One burrito bowl, one lunch soup and sandwhich, and I had the fish and chips. The fish and chips were actually really really good. Super crispy and flavorful. The other two, lackluster. Lastly we had the peach crumble dessert. It was okay. Nothing special and it took forever to get to our table. 

Bottom line about the Lazy Dog is: it comparable to a BJs restaurant. The service isn't great. Don't go here to have an intimate conversation. It is good for groups and families. I am glad I went and tried it but I don't see myself chomping at the bit to go back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere I love that I can bring my dog here! Decent price, nice service. Heavy pour drinks too. Food was yummy good experience"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review because I do really enjoy most of the food here. But this is the third time they screwed up. I ordered through Door Dash and specifically said NO blue cheese on my sandwich, and of course it comes with blue cheese. What a total waste because although I picked it off, I could still taste it and just threw it out.

Second time I ordered through Grub Hub. My bison meatloaf came with NO mashed potatoes. Not sure how they managed to close the lid and not notice a meatloaf sitting alone with some spinach. The manager did refund us which we appreciated. 

And then there's today, we decided to pick up the order. They went over the order and put everything in the bag. The lids were closed so it just looked like everything was in there. We get home and there is no gravy for the meatloaf. We literally drove back for that. We didn't pay $18 for an incomplete meatloaf, I don't care if it's just gravy. 

Ugh, Lazy Dog you guys need to get it together. It's three times too many."}
{"text":"Brought my friends here for diner because I have had great service in the past. We actually had reservations at a restaurant for dinner next door but had an hour to wait. We explained we would sit on the balcony and just have a couple drinks. The waitress was not happy at all. We all felt awkward. My friends had to order their ingredients. I will not come back, or recommend this restaurant unless you are here for lunch. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunches I have experienced in the patio and the waitress staff."}
{"text":"Did a quick search for a place to eat lunch after arriving at the airport. This place has good reviews and was convenient to the rental car center.

We walked in and it has a comfortable lodge type feel. It was busy but we were seated right away. Our server asked if we had been in before and when we told him we had not he gave us a quick run through of the menu and told us he would bring us a little something for our first time. 

Christopher brought us an order of the garlic waffle chips which was a welcome sight since we were really hungry!

I ordered the onion ring poutine off the appetizer menu while my wife ordered the pork noodle bowl off the lunch menu and both items were right at $10.00!

Christopher was a fantastic server and we appreciated his attentiveness."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night Prices are actually pretty reasonable and the service was GREAT! We ordered a few appetizers (flatbread & Brussel sprouts) and then chicken parmesan & fettucine. I made a huge mess all over and spilled sauce. I felt so bad but our server was great! (Kati) She took care of it without making me feel horrible about it. I Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went for a bday dinner and there was 10 of us. Katrina was our server and she was AMAZING! So personable, friendly and attentive. Make sure to ask for her! Food was great but the service was even better!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Great food and Dariah our server really understands the meaning of hospitality will be back"}
{"text":"Food was excellent service was extremely slow from the kitchen to server. We were 1 of 2 tables in the place & it took 40 mins for salads to come out"}
{"text":"Timijen is amazing. He pays attention to his customers and he's a sweetheart. Great customer service all around. 
Awesome awesome awesome"}
{"text":"We love coming here because it's near us and we always have a great time. It doesn't matter if your whole group wants something all different because Lazy Dogs has so many different options on their menu. My favorite is the poke jar. It's delicious! Every time we come here, we have a different server and the service is amazing all around!"}
{"text":"My first time here!!! Service was fabulous and the flights of beer was really good. My salad was also very light and tasteful. The chicken tortilla soup was very Delish and my husband had the pot roast and it was perfect"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb the sampler sangrias are really good and a fun sampler for your fruity pleasure. We've also brought my sweet dog and she had a great time having the chicken and rice and the staff is so attentive and nice. Very professional. We love coming for the food and environment."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and it was the most PERFECT dining experience I have honestly ever had in my entire life.

They were packed (It was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected), but we only had to wait 5 minutes. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, very warm and inviting, classy but very casual. I felt like I never wanted to leave! 

5 stars for customer service alone! My bf ordered the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich, which I thought was a little out of his picky eater comfort zone, and naturally he wasn't a fan. He said it was \"not hot enough, not spicy enough, needs more cheese and less cucumber.\" So I kindly asked our waitress if she could box that up and bring us the menu so he could order something else. I had every intention of paying for it, but she said she would just take it off the bill. I thought that was A++ customer service. THAT is what builds patronage. 

I had the Sundried tomato pesto pasta, and it was awesome. 

But what I really came here to write the review about. THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE  (If only words could echoe)

Was. The best thing. I have. Ever eaten. In my life. 

With whip cream, candied walnuts, chocolate and caramel syrup. This is legitimately what happened:

We both took a bite at the same time. Chewed. Eyes lit up. Swallowed. Looked at each other and we both said \"wow.\" in synchrony. Continued to take more bites and saying wow after till it was all gone.

Only con is that it is seasonal! So please, if you value your life at all, go to Lazy dog before winter is over, get whatever you want, but order THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE."}
{"text":"Consistently absentee service personnel. After calling the restaurant, a waitress finally showed up. She fails to return to note our appetizer order was not delivered as requested. Now our main course is wrong and no waitress... no manager and no help. Time and again we experienced HORRIBLE service at night.  One year since we've visited and the lack of service is stunning. No manager or waitress in the dining area."}
{"text":"Went here with a few girl friends for dinner. We were seated quickly, along with my pom puppy Steve. The waitress came over to get our drink orders, and was unable to tell us any of their cocktails that have vodka........really? It's vodka, no rocket science. She came back a few minutes later, got our food orders and then vanished. Someone else brought the food out to our table, and the one time we got our drinks refilled, it was by a different member of their staff. We literally had to cash out with the bartender! Some of the worst service I've ever had. But props for a restaurant where I can bring my pup. Cool idea!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for happy hour and dinner. The staff is always exceptionally friendly and welcoming.  Today Steve was our server and it was an awesome experience. We had a couple beers (love the house pale ale) and some apps (edamame, hummus, Brussels) all were tasty! We usually sit at the bar with Brandon, who always takes care of us as well. Definitely would recommend for a casual dinner, brunch or bite to eat."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is OK. Food is average. Happy hour in not a bad deal. I don't know that we will return any time soon."}
{"text":"I've came here this past Thursday night with my family. I've ordered the Slow-braised pork shoulder because it sounded so interest and I knew I wouldn't get this back in Hawaii where I'm from.  When the waitress served it to me, the meat was so dried out and I got so upset that the kitchen staff let it to be served. By the time the waitress showed up to our table, most of my family was done eating. She did asked me if I want anything else and I said no because everyone was almost done eating. Even though I said no the manager was nice to make a new one and made sure it was moist. I gave a 2 Star because she done that and took that off our bill. But still yet, I wasn't satisfied and now I wouldn't come back to this place whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Michael aka Mikey to his inferiors is the most solid server I've had in awhile. The guy is good."}
{"text":"We sat at a table in the bar area. We sat for about 10 minutes and watched servers take care of the tables on both sides of us. I get how they could've been busy since there seemed to be only 2 or 3 servers, however an acknowledgment would have been nice. We ended up leaving and didn't even hear a goodbye. We just ended up going to Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Very casual place to grab some beers and a nice lunch. The pot roast dip was amazing!  Everybody was very friendly and efficient place had a good vibe with bringing dogs to the restaurant. Not stuffy and just a great place to hang with friends"}
{"text":"Came here last week with my corgi! I love that there's water and food for your dogs!
Everyone else's orders looked great! I wasn't super hungry so I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup, and the soup was meh. This would be five stars if I hadn't had GIANT hunks of chicken in the \"soup\" there wasn't much broth and there was giant pieces of chicken that no one could eat in one spoonful which negates the point of a soup. 
Everyone else loved their orders, and the service was great. Just didn't like the soup, I'd pass ordering that again. Also, they were out of almost every beer we tried to order which wasn't fun. But, I will be back and try their other options soon. :)"}
{"text":"Great service and very dog friendly. We went out shopping and had our dogs with us.  This is a great place to grab drinks and order appetizers but I wouldn't come back here for dinner.  Might be a better choice for breakfast or brunch instead.  My husbands chicken pot pie was too watered down and was too heavy. My chicken Kung pao was way too salty!  Everyone took one bite and complained that all they could taste was the salt!  Perfect dish if you love over salty and overpowering flavorful foods.  My mother in law got the Alfredo fettuccine but this dish just tasted like heavy cream.  No flavor!  Very boring and easy to get sick of eating after couple of bites.  My father in law ordered a meat and pasta dish that was one of the best compared to other 3dishes.  Overall I like their brunch menu but wasn't too thrilled with how they flavor and salt the dinner dishes."}
{"text":"If they had a zero star I would select that instead. I'm a foodie who loves to try new places. This was one of the worst places I've eat ate. The food was disgusting. We had a party of 6 of us and I tried a bite of every ones. I would rather eat my daughters easy bake oven food over this. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. The staff was not friendly or helpful at all and it was not due to volume of customers."}
{"text":"Awesome. We love it dogs love it! just like being in Cali!  great drinks. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant, it was my first time coming here.I came with a party of twelve, we had no reservations and we were seated pretty quickly. Once we were seated we was greeted right away by our waiter who gave great service he was always checking up on us making sure if we needed anything. As for the menu they have a variety of choices, from salads, noodles, fried chicken, steaks, burgers and bowls. I had the pork fried rice and Cajun fries it was delicious. The cool thing is they have a patio where you can bring your dogs to dine with you. They even have a menu for your pets. So if your looking for a place with good food and a great dining experience come and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Slow service...It took roughly 40 minutes to get our food.  They tried to make it right by discounting the bill.  The food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here this week. Ambiance on the patio is lovely. Food is inexpensive and ok. Service is AWFUL!!! So slow, so many mistakes. Not very friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 stars. This place is a joke of an establishment. We waited at least 20 min to even get an order in. I had a group of people with 4 dogs total. We suggested to come here because of the great reviews and it's dog friendly! The food took forever to come out as well. The service is so slow, I swear coming out of that place, I aged another few years. I was better off in a long ass coma than to be there. Fascists don't got nothing on this place when it comes down to a slow and painful death... Ok, on to the food review.

We ordered the Hawaiian poke. That's a slap to the Hawaiian people. This poke was on a tortilla chip with smeared guacamole and 3 pieces of small tuna. I wouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Next, the pizza. Wtf, seriously, the pizza wasn't even a pizza. I ordered the all American burger. It was so gross, I couldn't even eat half. It came out so cold, I felt like I was eating a hamburger that came out of a refrigerator. Even North Korea wouldn't feed it to their enemies. The vegetable lasagna. Oh Jesus.. Where do I even start in this. It reminded me of lean cuisine. Prison inmates get fed way better than this slop. What was the best part of the meal? The dog food I ordered. I ordered the grilled chicken and hamburger with brown rice. It was the only thing that looked fresh and delicious. Yes, the dog meal looked way better and apparently tasted way better than the food because someone in our group was still starving because they didn't want to eat their own food. They said the grilled chicken was really good. Be warned, if you come here, just order the dog food, you'll get a better meal than the slop they serve."}
{"text":"Not real impressed and did not even get a drink or food.

I get it its new, its very popular and its in a great off strip part of town but.....

Went last Friday at 3:30PM for a drink and maybe an app or light early meal. We walk in ask for the patio and how long the wait is. The response \"The patio is closed, the wait is so long we have closed it\" I understand it could have been a two, three or four hour wait, but the response was just plain weird.  

We go to the bar, there are only single seats open, girlfriend sits down, thirteen minutes later, bartender says, \" Do you need a drink\"  We say \"'No thanks\" go to Wolfgang Puck and have a great time.

I can only image what the service here is like at 7PM on a Friday or Saturday, and I really want to try the grilled cheese, it sounds amazing."}
{"text":"Good food, crapy service defiantly won't be back, to many choices of great food in the area, have to have good service for return business."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my recent visit to Lazy Dog Town Square. The atmosphere is cozy with an indoor fireplace and rustic lodge feel. We were promptly greeted by a friendly host staff who showed us to our table. We couldn't have been seated for more than a minute when Sam came to introduce herself and guide us through the menu. She suggested the mango margarita which was delicious. We started with Brussels sprouts which came out quickly and were scrumptious. We had time to enjoy our Brussels and get a second drink before our food came out. The entrees looked amazing and tasted even better. Sam was very friendly and enthusiastic. She made me feel as though I was the guest and she were the host in her own home. We will be back time and time again and will be sure to sit with Sam each and every time."}
{"text":"We came in at 10pm, restaurant closes at 12.  Hostess was unfriendly and seemed burdened because we couldn't take a high-top table outside due to two seniors with us and a small dog--there were several open tables at the time.
Waiter Timijen came by for a drink order, food order, and once when we were pretty much done--we had to ask server and a different waitperson for refills, silverware, and some condiments.
Veggie Burger Bowl was very good.  Cobb Salad okay.  Decent burgers but one not cooked correctly and fries and onion rings were cold. 
Meal is now completed.  No waiter. No refills. No bill.  No one checking on us.  
I've eaten at this location a few times and it's often disappointing, only redeeming qualities are location (for us) and dog-friendly, when needed.
Town Square location is much better, if you must dine here. 
Oh, waiter finally came, so we asked for the bill..."}
{"text":"Just ate here had a grilled cheese, who messes up a grilled cheese? Lazy dog has done it.  Bread was stale, like biting into a 2x4 absolutely fucking horrible. Never again will I eat there. But the tea was good."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend around 3pm and sat at the bar. Bartenders were attentive and suggested a house beer made by golden road brewery. Iv heard good things about their beer program here but I wasn't impressed. Better then your local chilis but still nothing special to stay competitive. Apparently they let dogs here....didn't see any but not sure if I would have enjoyed the place with a bunch of dogs around. I go out to get away from my dogs... Place looks like claim jumper with a little edge. I ordered the pot roast dip. Flavor was good but there is too much bread for so little meat. My girlfriend had the Sriracha chicken sandwich which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"Food was great! Spinach and sun dried tomato cheese dip is a must! Tastes great! Strawberry basil mojito was good also. Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"My phone was dead from a previous event  .so I have no picturse ..This was the juicyed burger i eatten in along time good and thick not a ton of lettuce..cajun fries are flavorful not spicy ..anthe service was inpecable.staff at the Lazy Dog  is far from lazy..
.the patio were dogs are wdlome to eat with you was clean and wide open..there were ppl out side with thier pups..I am a ppl watcher so i watch faces aa pple eatyou could see the pleasure in each bite..."}
{"text":"Having anniversary dinner here tonight. Texas de brazil was packed so walked down here.  Our server Reagan is awesome. So far so good.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is a \"jack of all trades\" type of restaurant. The menu has a lot of variety, and out of the several dishes that I've had, everything has been delicious. My favorite is the Idaho Trout, as the way it's prepared is exquisite. Some of my other recommendations would be the Lamb Shank (although this is seasonal, so keep that in mind), and the Prime Rib French Dip. The French Dip isn't as good as the one at Nordstrom Cafe (see my review), but it's still a satisfying sandwich for any meal of the day. 

One area where Lazy Dog can improve is their service. On multiple occasions, both busy and slow, it seemed like the wait staff would take an exceptionally long time to cycle around to our table. I can understand when it's packed on a Friday night, but when the places is practically deserted, I just found it a bit odd. There was one instance where we had to call over our waiter three separate times to refill the water cups on our table. Mind you, this was an instance where it wasn't very crowded. 

Overall, the food is what makes Lazy Dog a nice meal spot. If the food weren't so good, I probably would give Lazy Dog 3 stars due to the service, but the food is truly that enticing. You may have to wait a while since they make everything from scratch, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It's really 3.5 stars for me but I'm being nice. Been here several times and was only disappointed once; that time was when I ordered a fish dish and it was mediocre. The ahi tuna is what I tried last time and it was pretty good. Butter cake is amazing for dessert and the sangria samplers are worth a try."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lazy Dog and I am impressed! From the moment we walked up to this beautiful clean modern building to the last delicious bite, I like Lazy Dog for several other reasons.  First they are Dog friendly and provide an enclosed shaded patio for Fido.  Your fur baby even gets his/her own bowl for water and there are some menu items that are pet friendly like the brown rice and chicken.  Our server Daniel greeted us promptly and provided suggestions based on our questions.  I enjoyed the soy glazed salmon with veggies and brown rice my company went for the trout with veggies.  Since I like beer I had to try a flight of this microbreweries best not so hoppy offerings. I fell in love with the Hefe. My hats off to the brewmaster for blending a honey toned hefe that is now amongst my favorite. The blonde and the stout came in for silver and bronze respectively. I cant forget to mention that we started our meal with the Hummus trio, which was delicious. But dessert was the icing on the cake pun intended.  We had the butter cake and it was worth every calorie that now I have to work off.  For a Monday afternoon the place was steady. The environment from the music to the sports on the televisions, to the great menu and bar selections mean that I will return and highly suggest you give this place a try."}
{"text":"What a neat little place!  
The beer tap at the bar is a fire-hydrant and the pour spouts are dog bones!  Love the creativity.  Beer selection is classic & the margaritas were unique. I tried a grapefruit one (wasnt a fan) ...so I changes for Sangria.  This was a way better choice.

The food is tasty and the menu is ample with variety. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Lazy Dog while visiting Las Vegas. Great food! You have to try the candy bacon and queso, both amazing!! Ashley our server was great. She gave great recommendations on food. And overall great dining experience! Kudos to Ashley! Thank you for taking great care of us. 

Caz"}
{"text":"They say everything is home made.  I thinks that's a great idea.  Using frozen product, not a good idea. I had the crusted ahi.  It was lacking in both taste and color. Obviously water logged from being previously frozen.  The white choc chip brownie may very well have been home made, about 8hrs earlier!  It was dry, not at all warm & chewy, and the ice cream on top was just meh. they need cooks that care what they are sending out.  Unfortunately, they just cook and the servers just serve.  Quality is sorely overlooked."}
{"text":"This is one our our go-to, favorite places to eat on the weekends. Service is always great, food is consistently great and the menu changes.  When the weather is cooler, we love to sit on the outdoor patio.  The patio is dog friendly,  while I think it's a great concept, sometimes the place can be a little over run with them!"}
{"text":"Great for a large group. Lots of options. Great service. Something for everyone. Dogs are outside which is great to those wanting an inside, dog free dinner. Win win for everyone."}
{"text":"First time in, and will be back!  Great food, nice atmosphere, and dog friendly!  Brunch menu was perfect, and delicious.  $5 brunch cocktails hit the spot!"}
{"text":"You ever just know a place isn't going to be good but you go anyway? That was how I went into dinner at Lazy Dog. I hadn't read the reviews or the menu, and despite my love for dogs, and the ability to bring them here, I just wasn't \"digging\" the place. I certainly get the appeal. I wanna like it. I really do. But, I just doesnt do it for me.
We arrived a party of 10, at 5:30 on a Tuesday night. The place looked empty at first, but once we got seated, it was quite crowded. (Bonus for us not having to wait more than 5 minutes.) The service was rather slow, and although busy, there seemed to be a lot of staff walking around. It took a while for them take our drink order, and it took quite a bit for them to be delivered. Which really sucked when they brought lousy drinks. My cadilac margarita was gross. No Grand Marnier floater as indicated and required of said drink. Just a way too sweet, yucky margarita. I switched to a mojito after first drink and liked that one better.
Reviewing the menu, I wasn't impressed. Nothing really jumped out at me. I did order for an appetizer the brussell sprouts. They were quite good. We really enjoyed them. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos with flour tortillas. I didn't really care for them. They weren't bad, but they weren't good. Something just didn't mesh well for me. My side wedge salad was pretty decent. 
For dessert, I got to try the keylime cheesecake and the brownie. Both were ok. Nothing to get all jazzed up about, but certainly fine.
I believe it was Brian A's review where it said it's exactly as you'd expect, he's correct. It's exactly what I expected, and I got that. So, nope, I would not return."}
{"text":"A swing and a big miss. Now I know that this place was named after the head chef. Although the restaurant is very nicely appointed, and the brioche bun was quite nice, everything else fell short. Nachos with chicken marinated in salsa verde came wet and soggy. We ordered all the sauces on the side because we like chips to be crispy. But the chicken was soaked in green sauce, which made the whole pile a soggy, wet mess. Yuck. The burger, on that very nice bun, was a totally uninspired frozen patty, which was ordered medium, came out red inside and cold (not not warm, actually cold) inside. Disgusting. Fries were the most basic, unseasoned, dull fries you could imagine. Absolutely forgettable and without a drop of creativity. And, no manager ever checked on our table even though we saw three of them and it was not busy. Great location, nice looking place, nice looking menu, total flop for us."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Kathe (our very helpful server) took her time to review the highlights of the menu since she obviously cared enough to ask if it was our first visit..... AND IT WAS OUR FIRST VISIT!!  She left a good impression with us as did the chefs/cooks/host.  Triple Hummus Starter plate.....delcious.....Main Course...Trout and Fish Tacos..... all winners by our standards.....but the DESERTS.... OMG .... to DIE FOR..... All I have to say is \" THANK YOU MISS MECHELLE (Mgr) for taking the time to stop by our table and introduce yourself & your favorite desert to my mom and me..... it is now our fav too.  Great people & great spot to hang with friends or family..JUST GO."}
{"text":"My friend and I came by today for lunch. 

You get free Cajun fries when you check in on Yelp. They were a little too seasoned for my tastes, but I can't really complain because they were free! 

I wish I took a picture of it, but I absolutely love their menu. It's colorful and pretty to look at, it's done in a floaty watercolor style. 

I ordered the Mac and Cheese, and my friend ordered the Ancient Grains salad. I wish I ordered the salad now because it looked absolutely amazing! Not to say my Mac and Cheese was bad, it was tasty. 

I also ordered the Strawberry Citrus soda. While it didn't include free refills, from the description it sounded like the perfect refreshing drink for a blistering hot summer day. It totally was! 

The service was quick, too, and our bills included a free appetizer card for next time. Needless to say, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"OMG - Awesome vibe - Cool St. Patty's Day atmosphere- I had the Pork Shank - Awesome !!! - My friends were super pleased with their choices- Pot Pie, Nachos etc. -"}
{"text":"If you're a dog lover you'll love the dog-friendly patio where you can order rice, chicken and water for your canine. If you're not a dog lover you'll want to avoid the patio altogether. There are dogs of all shapes and sizes and some are less well behaved than others. Some owners are completely oblivious to what their dogs are doing. There was one big one climbing  on top of my kid and I had to yell at the dog to get down and the owner to watch their pet.

The food is better than your average chain restaurant, but still has a calculated, impersonal feel to it. The Tex-Mex salad was a standard, serviceable version. Hawaiian sticky ribs weren't as tender as I expected, but the Asian flavors delivered a powerful kick of tanginess and sweetness, served with fries covered with a spicy mayo sauce. The best item I've tried at Lazy Dog was the Carolina pulled pork sandwich. Served on a brioche bun, the combo of tender pork covered in a tangy BBQ sauce and the sharpness from bleu cheese was a winner in my book."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of more than one Lazy Dog location in California. We travel with our fur baby, Brownie, and it's convenient when wanting to stop and grab a bite to eat and have that restaurant feel without having to hit up a fast food drive-thru. This location in Downtown Summerlin was nothing like any of my experiences at other LD restaurants. I came in with a group of friends and inside was pretty busy at first, but really cleared out half way through our meal. Regardless of the amount of customers inside, getting our server to acknowledge us was a major chore. We only ordered some nachos and mac and cheese, so I can't figure out what the problem was and getting drink refills wasn't easy either. 

Mac and Cheese ($6.50) - Smoked bacon, hatch chilies, five cheeses, green onion crumble make up their take on this dish. The bacon was very fatty and not good. There was so much green onion crumble on the top, which had a super funky taste to it (one person at my table described it as mold) and it didn't complement the mac and cheese at all. When we asked our server if the mac and cheese from the kids menu was anything special so we could maybe try that also and he responded that it's basically just Kraft mac and cheese. 

Chicken Chile Verde Nachos ($10.50) - hand-cut chips, slow-cooked tomatillo chicken, black beans, jack, cheddar, guacamole, salsa, tapatio crema, pickled jalapenos andqueso blanco. The nachos came piles high. Some of the chips were burnt. The toppings tasted decent, but there just wasn't enough of it for the amount of chips. Once we got through the top layer it was all chips after that.

The one plus about this place is that the patio is dog friendly and it's got a decent amount of tables/seating including an area with a fire pit. There's a menu for dogs and they will bring out a water bowl. I can't say I am eager to come back however I'd be open to giving this location another try down the road."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday mid-afternoon, and the food and drinks came a little slower than they should have since it wasn't terribly busy inside. Cool vibe and decent food. Our server, Jamie, was a professional. The Bison meatloaf was ok, but Ive had Bison burgers with more flavor and in larger portions. Their large draft Bud Light cost $6.50, which gave me sticker shock. It's ok if you want to try something new and different, but, with soooo many options in Summerlin, your money may go further elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to second Janae A (reviewed on 4/28/2015) on my review. The food, drinks, happy hour, and atmosphere are awesome and I love that I can bring my fur baby Helen with me. Unfortunately that's when I get the worst service. I've been here multiple times with and without my dog. When I'm without my dog I'm sitting inside and service is efficient, prompt, and friendly. When I bring Helen and I'm out on the patio the service is not good at all. Wait times on food and drinks were way too long and I had to flag our waitress down more than twice. Also I don't know how seriously management takes this but none of us got carded when we ordered alcohol. We're all over 21 but we definitely don't look like it. Considering they're a new location I may consider giving them a shot in the future but service when you're out on the patio needs serious work"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. The night we stopped in the draft beers were out so opted for the Mojitos. Excellent drinks here as is the food. Had the pot roast and wedge salad and both were  scrumptious. We'll be sure to bring the dog next time."}
{"text":"I did have a less than average experience on my last visit.  I put my review on yelp and the owner saw that I wasn't a happy customer.  He contacted me through yelp and asked for my contact information so he could have his manager call me and hear about my visit.  
His manager Jake called me so I could go over my experience at the lazy dog.  Jake called and was apologetic and said he would address both the issues with his employees and get them the proper training. He was very nice and empathetic with me.  I was very impressed that the owner actually had his manager contact me to go over what happened. That is extremely professional.  It's next to impossible to give perfect service every time in the restaurant business and I understand that.  I will definitely be back to day Hi to Jake"}
{"text":"hella dogs. some well behaved, some not so much. this coming from a dog lover. our waiter was super sweet but unfortunately we were left wondering where he went, as no one came to check on us for a long time and we hadn't even placed our food order yet and our glasses were dry. the food was ok, and the sangria was good. the happy hour bill for 6 people was less than $100, so not too bad."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tex mex salad.  Delivered missing ingredients described in the menu.  server tried to tell me it was buried under the lettuce .  When I showed her it wasn't there she at least brought me the ingredients in the side.   Tired of chain restaurants that don't care about quality."}
{"text":"So we ventured off to Summerlin today for dinner to try this new place.  Why?  I was told that they have HATCH chili and I love me some Hatch Chili.   We sat outside with this perfect weather.  Ordered the seasonal mason jar and some Cajun fries to tame the hunger.  Ordered some Hatch Chili Bacon Mac & Cheese and let me tell you what treat. It's the little things sometimes that make you happy.   Also tried the  grilled cheese and for sure those two were amazing and worth the trip for good hatch chili and  grilled cheese made to perfection, especially when you need some tasty comfort food!   This place is ultra dog friendly, hence the name Lazy Dog  you can sit outside and enjoy the view, the dogs and the amazing fire pit. I ordered the Chicken Poblano, it was good, but came out a little cold. The concept of the crispy tamale cake with the roasted peppers and cream sauce which was really more like a tomatillo sauce, but still tasty.  It would have been better if it was hot and  served over the tamale cake and the roasted peppers with the white chunks of chicken.  Nonetheless a place worthy of return especially with friends for an evening out and your furry friend.  I will be back for the grilled cheese and next time I'll have it with the chicken tortilla soup  and maybe ask for some roasted hatch chili on my tortilla soup.. I think I just made myself hungry again."}
{"text":"I love the food here at Lazy Dog but tonight the service was absolutely horrible. We sat at the bar too tables and waited for over 10 minutes before we had to stop a waitress to ask for drinks. The service after that didn't get much better. It took almost 20 minutes after sitting for someone to bring us menus and then another 25 minutes until our food came. We had no clue who or waiter/waitress actually was since no one actually introduced themselves and each person to help up was someone different. The table next to us sat, ordered, ate and paid all before we even put our order in... extremely poor service and super disappointed in this location. For sure will not ever be coming here again."}
{"text":"Not much else to say.  Ribs were terrible (deep fried baby back ribs!...who the heck does that !).  Lettuce was brown in the salad. Exchanged for meatloaf and wasn't much better. 

Iced tea was good."}
{"text":"I love Lazy Dogs, and of course my dog love this restaurant! Every time she just gets so excited to see all these new friends, and not to mention her hearty entree with brown rice and burger patty!

A must for any dog parents!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was great! Highly recommend. Our server Sam was very knowledgeable and accomodating. She was very busy but happy to be in the chaos. Hard to find service like hers! One of a kind!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Very down home flavors in a comfortable environment. 
Channon made the experience over the top. Beautiful, witty, on her game with suggestions and amazing."}
{"text":"I would say we're not the ones to brag about breakfasts, but Marilynn and I were pretty impressed with lazy dogs server \"Los\" short for Carlos, he recommended the banana fosters French toast. Very good choice Marilynn stated. I had the breakfast club. WOW found a new place for biscuits breakfast sandwich. The experience was very relaxing and being outside by the fireplace in the patio, very romantic for an early bird date. Our bill was only $27.58 good value."}
{"text":"Very trendy new place in town to grab a bite and a few drinks.

Awesome happy hour selection on food and drinks. I personally recommend the Cajun Fries and a tall glass of Hoppy Time to go along with them.

Our group had about 10 people during happy hour and the place was mostly packed in the bar area but didn't feel constrained.

All the staff was extremely nice and we had a great time trying out new brews. I highly recommend this place whenever you need a drink, a bite and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few time during happy hour before the most recent visit when I tried the dinner menu. The halibut was so dry but the very center was slightly pink. I'm guessing it was cooked very poorly from frozen. My 12 year old liked his flat iron, but the salt on the green beans wasn't distributed evenly so some bites made me cringe from the salt. I've never had any issue with the service."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp after I'd gone to an hour & a half long interview. I was famished and jittery. What a gem of a place! Besides the area on the patio that accommodates dogs, it's a lovely ambiance that you can sit for hours (literally!). I was here for at least 4 hours talking the afternoon away. Soon it was evening & dinner time. You just feel warm and cozy here. 
So now let's talk about the food -  I found the choices to be different and ecclectic. Very nice presentation and my pesto/basil pasta was delish! My friend had the blackened chicken salad which I took a bite from. It was somewhat spicy but not too spicy. I thought it would be a great dish if there was some ranch on it.
I'm definitely going to return to this place. There's quite a few items I'd like to try. The clean and clear cut menus make choosing simple. However, on the flip side of great, I'd like to see more variety of sauces. Campfire sauce, creamy pesto, creamy blue cheese, etc. In addition, please try adding crispy chicken to your menu. I'd like to have the chicken salads but prefer crispy chicken strips sliced up.

Otherwise, a wonderful experience. You should try this place out too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed taking my dogs here for lunch!!
Came here on Sunday but it wasn't that crowded so we were seated right away on the patio (dog friendly area).
Heather, our waitress was so nice and friendly to us and our dogs. Everyone was very attentive.
I had Grilled Portobello Burger with fries. It was pretty good. The fries were hot and crunchy.
Tossed Cobb Salad was very fresh but I felt it didn't have enough chopped chicken. 
Cast Iron Idaho Trout was very thin compared to other restaurants'. Didn't have much meat. 
Now, the main part... The dog meals!! We ordered chicken meal and hamburger meal. I've been to a handful of restaurants that serve dog meals and they are always either over salted or disgusting taste. (Yes, I always have to taste what goes into my dog's mouths) Not the lazy dog's dog meals!! They are not salted and tasted OK!! Love it. I highly recommend their dog meals for your dogs because they are perfectly safe and I'm sure your dogs will enjoy. 
I'm not sure if I would come back here without my dogs since there are so many other options in the area but I would definitely come back here with my dogs because I know they enjoyed this place so much :-)"}
{"text":"How fun is this place!? What a great time to eat awesome yummy food with our doggies! There were so many people with nice dogs. They even had a special menu for your furry children. They had a Yelp special that had complimentary Cajun fries that were some of the best fries I've ever had. I ordered the tai noodles and my husband ordered the bison meatloaf. Alena and David were super sweet and I hope they expand over to the east coast. Great concept."}
{"text":"Great service! Awesome experience!

We had reservations for 15 people today. We  were all so well taken care of by our amazing servers Janee and Lihau. I thought it was great that we had two servers for such a big party. Our glasses were always filled, the food was all brought out at a timely manner, the servers were both kind, made split checks an easy process and helped us enjoy our celebration even more by such attentive service. Everyone enjoyed their food too! 

I tried several dishes, including the turkey meatballs, chicken salad sandwich, Brussels sprouts, Cajun fries, inside out quesadilla, edamame and butter cake. The Brussels sprouts and butter cake were my favorite selections! The Brussels sprouts were served in a cast iron dish with a lemon butter sauce, capers and a little char on them. I didn't realize I was a fan of these little veggies until now. The butter cake? Oh my god. Crunchy crust, gooey butter inside, strawberry balsamic reduction and vanilla ice cream. At $5.50 it can't be beat. We ordered one and then another because it was that good. I look forward to coming back to this place. Bring your pup and hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Good service! And priced well too! Had the havarti chicken sandwich...amazing!! Add avocado and it's even better! Roast beef dip is on awesome French bread too! We will be back! Yum!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome! They have a large bar, great decor, and a huge outdoor covered patio. 

We had brunch here and it was awesome. The hubs had the chilaquilles (he said it was good but very tomato-ey) and I had the carnitas & tater tot hash (amazing!). 

We look forward to coming here with our dogs to enjoy the patio (they have a couple of dog food options, too!). 

Service was great and location is desirable. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog provides us with a perfect example of average. Good, but not great. A true 3 star restaurant in every way.

Let me break it down for you:

* The food is good. It is not great, but it doesn't try to be. The architects of this place have sought out to appeal to the largest percentage of tastes. All the right options, all the proper ingredients so that everyone can find something. It is the \"smart business\" way of doing restaurants, find the middle of the road dishes that appeal to the greatest number of people. This approach is very popular with the large corporate chain restaurants.
* The service is good, but does not stand apart. Great service can only come from one place - it comes from servers who love what they do. There are several ways servers get to the point where they love what they do: great money, great schedule, great coworkers, great food, great management, great clientele, great location and great reputation are all factors that can affect how servers perform. This typically occurs when there are more \"great\" than \"good\" factors in this list. From the looks of it, Lazy Dog must have mostly \"good\".
* The prices are poor, to say the least. Yes, I understand that the location is prime and rents are most likely higher than many areas on the east side of town (no offense to East Siders). But no matter how you try to paint your picture, people always have a sense of value when they eat out. We all have this inner voice that can accurately balance the price point of the meal to the overall quality/quantity. A good tasting meal that comes in large portions and is inexpensive is always a winner. A good tasting meal that comes in small portions and costs and arm and a leg is always a disappointment, except in the case where it adds a notch to our culinary bedpost (i.e. a meal at Masa in New York City, which costs $585 per person).

Lazy Dog will be a success, mostly because of the disposable income crowd who, amazingly enough, always have the worst taste when it comes to food (yes, I did mean to offend them). 

Lazy Dog will always follow along with its namesake and keep making dishes that are just average. They will never takes risks, they will never go out on a limb. Their offerings will be good but not great, the prices will always be too high for their portions and their service will always be mediocre...

...because that is the great American business model for success - be average."}
{"text":"We love to come to lazy dogs - the food, the atmosphere, the drinks! Ask for heather! She is the best!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! Everything that we've tried is awesome! The umami sauce with the fries is a must have!! We always have friendly servers. 
We are super bummed that they took the cinnamon sugar pizza dessert off the menu though!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for some time because I'm one of those crazy dog moms. I took my pup here to eat with my mom for happy hour. It wasn't busy when we went and even when I went inside, it wasn't terribly busy either. Anyways, we ordered the Idaho trout, Cajun fries, turkey meatballs, ahi poke jar and a chicken bowl for my pup. 

Our server was very slow and inattentive. It seemed like he forgot about us because we were in the patio. A lot of the other staff was more helpful to us than he was.  The manager (I think or supervisor or whoever) ended up helping us more. 

Onto the food:
* Idaho trout - It was just okay. My mom says it was too oily for her and I thought it wasn't worth the money. The menu says that it is $16.75 but they charged us $17.50 for it. At that point we were too annoyed and wanted to leave so we didn't say anything. (2/5) 
* Cajun fries - They were delicious and the sauce it comes with is really good. It's $3 on the happy hour menu but free when you check in so it's worth trying (5/5)
* Turkey meatballs - These were a lot better than I anticipated. Great happy hour option (5/5)
* Ahi poke jar - The concept is cute but this was a miss for me. The happy hour price of this was $8 which I thought was expensive. They give you a tiny little jar with a small layer of ahi on top. I would rather pay $8 somewhere else and get an entire poke bowl. The actual food wasn't terrible, just the pricing. (3/5)

All in all, this place is a solid 3 out of 5 stars because their food is decent. The only thing that stood out to me was the idea of having lunch with your dog but the service was not great, so I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's okay if you're hanging around at Downtown Summerlin on this side of the mall where Lazy Dog is, and especially if you have your pooch with you. The food is definitely \"meh.\" I think you come here for the ambience, sitting in Summerlin, maybe with your dog, and certainly with your friends (a great group spot). Just get the solid happy hour foods, or a burger or some deep fried cheese. Don't think outside of the box. It's okay."}
{"text":"First time to Lazy Dog and we loved it. We dropped in right at happy hour which was a super lucky occurrence for us so we sat at one of the booths at the bar to partake. We were very hungry and decided to try a lot of dishes from the happy hour menu. We may have overdone it a little. 

First off the service was beyond excellent. Our waiter was super friendly and took amazing care of us. Plus the manager brought us out some free garlic flat bread when they found out we were first timers. How cool is that? 

Every dish we ordered was great. No, this isn't a gourmet expensive restaurant. It's a bar and grill kind of restaurant but with much much much better food. The hummus trio was a delicious start and I loved the ahi poke. It was super fresh and definitely a good snack. We also enjoyed the chicken verde nachos which were absolutely massive! 

I really would like to go back and try more stuff off their menu. Plus you can bring your dog and sit on the covered outdoor patio. I love dog friendly establishments!"}
{"text":"I've frequented the Lazy Dog Summerlin location not necessarily for myself but to spoil my dog and who doesn't love their dog? 

ATMOSPHERE:
I've only sat outside, as this is where your to be seated with your dog. I actually really like the outdoor area, there's a nice fire pit in the middle and TVs mounted as well. Plenty of tables, the wait is never too bad. Nice place to have brunch with your family. 

FOOD:
One word. Mediocre. 
I've tasted too many things here and while I can appreciate that lazy dog is trying offer a menu full of variety and it lacks flavor. Tried the nachos, plain, bland, and not enough toppings.  Tried the oven baked pancake, someone should tell whoever came up with this idea a pancake shouldn't be baked, it sticks to the pan they bring it in and is flat. The one decent dish here I would suggest would be the fish and chips, nothing special but the fish is always cooked just right. Also definitely try non-alcoholic drink creations here I really appreciate that part of their menu. Love the pineapple coconut water drink, perfect for the Vegas heat.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Hit and miss, I've had awesome waitors and oblivious ones. It does getbusy here on weekends and they seem overwhelmed at times. I don't like to bash people because we never know what's going on behind the scenes. I love that it's pet friendly, my dog has never gotten sick from the food and that's why I return. 

Overall, if your looking for a casual day out with your pet and family I'd recommend this spot. If your not with your pet and looking for a nice dish, there's better options in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"We loved this place! It is a Lil hot outside on the patio for a summer evening but the atmosphere was great. We ordered the cajon fries and a artichoke cheese dip. Both were very good. The servings were plenty for two sharing. We brought the puppy and he had brown rice !! Good time and will definitely return"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant search filter these days is \"dog friendly\". Our toy Chihuahua would much rather go with us than be left behind in a strange motel room smelling of Fabreze. The dog-friendly filter for Las Vegas yielded a few places that looked like they might work for both humans and dogs.

Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar fit the bill. We went here for brunch after church and were promptly ushered to a comfortable, covered outdoor patio. What first struck me was the dog-friendly section was packed while the indoor tables were sparely populated. This place is a magnet for dog owners. Everybody seemed to get along. The owners wisely figured out that packing dogs too closely together could lead to territorial disputes.

We ordered a delicious hummus appetizer and the sunny side up pizza. Our dog slept through the hummus plate but woke up when the pizza arrived sprinkled with bits of bacon. I got through two slices before she wormed out of the shoulder bag carrier and had her paws on the table. I gave her a dish with some egg yolk, bacon sprinkles, and a bit of pizza crust. She was happy, I was happy and relaxed. I had ordered the beer sampler (they make their own) which I highly recommend.

There was only one barking incident when two dogs left at the same time when two new ones entered. Our waiter said his favorite dog day was when he had a packed house and an ambulance went by."}
{"text":"My family and I love going to Lazy Dog because well... we love the concept that we can bring our dog to dinner with us! 

The dogs can only sit in the patio area, so I have only experienced the dining experience from the outside. The area is nice and spacious with many tables that can seat customers. There are plenty of fans and shades to cool you off in the summer and I believe there is a fire pit that can warm you up in the winter (I have yet to witness this as it's crazy hot here in Vegas right now!) 
 
My experience: The food is mediocre, there wasn't a wow factor for me yet and I've been here twice. Let's just say this is just not food I would crave, but it is good enough. For the first time I got the Ahi poke jar that came with wonton crisps. As for the second time, I got the pot roast beef dip. One thing that I liked most out of their menu was the street corn wheel's (pretty much an elote). 

My dog's experience: He gets water in a bowl and he ordered the brown rice with grilled chicken breast. Overall, satisfied with his food and water under the table!"}
{"text":"I think it's wonderful there is a menu for dogs and it was so great having them around the tables outside (all well behaved!).... but unfortunately the food was just so--so for humans and inside was very, very loud."}
{"text":"I ate here and it was so amazing!!! We sat on the patio (really awesome) and Sam R. was our server. She was great! You can tell she actually cared about us. I had the All-American burger and it was by far the best burger I've had in awhile!! I can't say enough good things about this place. Great atmosphere, great service, great food! Bring your dog in too! I've never seen a place like that in Vegas."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my family and our pet chihuahua on Friday afternoon.  Food was superb and the service was exceptional..  will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area again.  My son is a picky eater and loved the shrimp Alfredo, I had the shrimp tacos and they were so yummy.  My daughter had the fish and chips and says they were great.  My husband had the ahi tuna salad and loved it.  Will definitely be looking forward to visiting one in my area."}
{"text":"Always good food and drinks. Service is real good. I love the hummus trio app and several of the dishes like fish tacos, salads, burgers. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great burger. I had the black and bleu burger which was amazing. Our order was overlooked in the beginning so it took awhile to get our food. However management handled the sitiuation professionally and made the overall experience a great one."}
{"text":"Summerlin could use a lovely restaurant but this isn't it.  The food is odd because the cuisine is all over the map.  The prices are moderately high.  I would go here for drinks only. 
As the owner has asked for specifics here goes:

The chicken poblano was not spicy it was peppery.  Yes pepper is a spice but not the only one available to enhance food.  It was inedible and I sent it back.  I then had to wait over 20 minutes for a cold sandwich I ordered in its place.  Too long.
My husbands pot pie had no taste at all and the sauce was gummy.  The brick spinach appetizer was odd and over salted.  There really needs to be improvement with the spices here.  I think you are trying for too much variety you might want to specialize in one cuisine.  But you definitely need to figure out the proper uses of salt, pepper and spices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday night for a date night. It's just off the strip, so it's more expensive than most nearby restaurants but it's also classier. The restaurant itself is huge and quite beautiful. The menu was also very large. Our server was nice and the speed of service was just right. While we probably wouldn't make it a regular date night, we will certainly be back for special occasions."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time. Food was delicious, our server Carol was phenomenal. Would definitely recommend this place for future visits."}
{"text":"I love how you can bring your dogs to the covered porch. It was so entertaining to see other people's dogs and my friend's dog interact. They even offer food and free water for the pooches. Mix in the meat with the rice if you want the dog to eat the rice. They have a nice fire pit to hang out at. We didn't know at first that we couldn't bring them inside and the hostess almost had a heart attack. They will come outside and seat you. The staff can't really interact with the dogs, unfortunately. They have cute animal decor on the inside. The food was average. They offered lots of options for sides. They have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"The food was meh. We ordered ahi poke and chicken nachos off of the happy hour menu. The ahi was good but very little portion size. The nachos on the other hand were awful and a large portion size. The chips were stale, and had 6 pieces of chicken a few black beans and some melted cheese, and guacamole. Also got a beer sampler which consisted of six 4 ounce samples of lazy dog beer line."}
{"text":"I brought my son to this restaurant with our dog and had an amazing experience with the wonderful & sweet waitress named Carol.  She was great with making and giving some great recommendations as well as treating the dog and my son very well.  She even let me know and I've been here several times but they have dog food for the dogs!! I never realized they have food for the dogs.  The dish I had was absolutely stupendous not to mention delicious & flavorful and  wow, healthy it was called charred lemon chicken and my son had the bison burger and it was excellent as well.  Thank you Carol and Lazy Dog Team."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour & even reverse happy hour during the week.

Food portions are shareable, prices are reasonable, and taste is great! They do get busy, so try to get there before the rush.

Happy Hour:
Mon. Fri.: 3pm - 6pm
Sun. - Thurs.: 9pm - Close"}
{"text":"This is a doggy friendly restaurant (outdoor section only), which is pretty neat!

I ordered the lunch special: Half Sandwich (Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich) & Half Soup (Cream of Asparagus) w/ fries = $8.75

Portion size: 
They give a pretty generous amount of food for a lunch menu. The soup was more than a cup, and the half sandwich was pretty big. I eat a lot, and this was sufficient. If their lunch size was sufficient, I'm assuming regular menu would be more.

Taste: 
The Cream of Asparagus was delicious. It was creamy & thick, and that's how I like my soup. They also top it with fresh pieces of asparagus. The Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich was creamy, generous amount of chicken, but the bread was too dry for me. Fries were average - not bad, but not the best.

Price:
Their prices are standard. Meals start $5 (small plate) and can go up to $27

Ambience:
Decor & interior is nice. Very cabin/woods-y. And of course, a lot of pictures & artwork of dogs.

Service:
Our server was good & on top of things. They were slightly busy, but our server didn't neglect our table at all.

I'd definitely come back here & try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"They allow dogs here and have a dog menu, give dogs water.... how can you NOT love this place!  But for those of you who are animal shy, the animals are on the patio only and not inside so you can still enjoy this restaurant without animals around if you so choose.  But I love it... happy dogs wagging their tails while you eat?!  What's not to like.  Okay, an occasional bark here and there as they check each other out, but it adds to the character of this place.  The food is great!  The service was awesome.  Huge menu selection.  I like this place!  Definitely a great watering hole."}
{"text":"The sweet and spicy shrimp is TO DIE FOR. I love everything here! The drinks, the food, the atmosphere. I try to get more friends to know about this place so that they all request to come here more often!

I've never had to wait to eat and I've come in at all sorts of times ranging from 4pm to 7pm."}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. The atmosphere was great and I love a place you  are encouraged to take the pups! The service was slow but our waitress was super nice. We ate the focaccia sandwich, pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes, sweet potato tater tots and cucumber salad. Focaccia, cucumber, and tater tots were delicious. Pulled pork and mashed potatoes were just alright. Anyways, will be back to enjoy the patio once it cools down a bit!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband over the weekend! Everything on the menu sounded great & the food was amazing. I will be back for sure to try it all!"}
{"text":"Came in at 530 pm- 30min prior to happy hour. Carrie was our server. We were greeted immediately and placed an order for chicken wraps and poke bowl until we decide to order entrees. 45 min later our food comes in a box and the lady says here is your to go order. Hmmmmmm.... we didn't make a to go order. Now the gal is gone and Carrie comes back 5 min later to say I don't know where they got the to go order from. 
So than takes another 15 min to get our appetizers. No apologies or anything. 
Than 15 minutes later we received our entree. 
Overall not impressed at all and will never come back. I could have cooked at home and not wasted time waiting an hour and half for chicken breast. While the managers or people who had keys were at the bar chuckling it up with their friends. No one even acknowledge the mistake. Overall slow service & the food was burnt which was also disappointing !



Chris- thank you for reaching out, howeverI don't have access to contact you via Yelp. My email address is jennii182000@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"They  were packed Friday night. The drinks are specials are decent. Love the Jamaican lemonade too. Shared several appetizers. They Send me offers for free food.  Plus, I checked in on Yelp so they brought us a huge basket of fries. 
Me and two others  had the bison meatloaf. I thought the flavor was unique. I enjoyed my meal. They used barbecue sauce, and other spices. There was nine of us and all of our food was luke warm!  I  would have preferred to have my dinner served hot. We didn't have time to send it back. We had plans after dinner.
The service was so slow, .
I was afraid I would get sober before I get my next drink!

This is one of my go to places now. Fun to sit outside and  watch the dogs and people waiting on them? Especially after a few drinks."}
{"text":"High end bar food that is actually good, better than other places. Main dishes $$$, but lunch specials are actually reasonable and good!!! Our server, Arizona, was awesome. Her humor and helpfulness made our experience more memorable. First timers get a free appetizer and don't forget to check in because you get free Cajun fries!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Lazy Dog a couple weeks ago for a dinner out with friends. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and based on the vibe of the table, my friends felt the same way. Since this was my first time at any Lazy Dog location, I signed up online for the email club and got a coupon for a free starter or small plate up to $11. I ended up ordering the chicken chile verde nachos and a side Caesar salad. The chicken chile nachos were good overall, they had black beans, cheese, tomatillo chicken, and guacamole on top. The only thing I didnt like is that they were advertised as coming with pickled jalapenos and they arrived covered with fresh jalapenos... I personally don't like the taste of fresh jalapenos (but I LOVE pickled), so I pushed them off and asked for some pickled, but they just brought me another side of fresh jalapenos, but diced this time instead of sliced lol. Otherwise, they were pretty good! The Caesar salad was good as well. I also liked our waiter, he was friendly and faced honest opinions when I asked instead of the standard \"I love everything here, you really can't go wrong!\" answer everyone always gives you. I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is especially delicious. My daughter and I really like the spicy fries. The fact that they allow my dogs makes this my favourite place =) They are busy thou it seems every time we go which is fine, just plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great food! Great place to celebrate a dogs ! birthday staff is awesome especially merrica the host who set up a great area for my fur babies 1st birthday"}
{"text":"Visited the evening of 11/2 and the place was slammed with folks watching game 7 of the World Series.  Sat inside and it was cozy without feeling overcrowded.  Peeked out on the patio and saw a nice fire pit and several canine pals dining with their people.

Menu price and selection is excellent.  Our server was Finn and she was outstanding.  Her great service alone would have been enough reason to come back, but coupled with the good food, it made for a totally winning evening. We will definitely try to sit in her section again.  I'd also like to note all the staff members were pleasant and friendly.

So many good menu choices to please everyone from appetizers to small plates to entrees.  My partner chose the pot roast dip sandwhich with red mashed potatoes.  I had a small bite of the pot roast and it was tender and so good.  I chose the cast iron turkey meatballs with pine nuts, marinara, mozzarella,  and basil.  Even though it was a small plate, it could easily be considered as a filling small stand alone meal.  For my next visits, I have my eye on the cast iron trout and the bison meatloaf.

Definitely recommend this as an upscale casual experience that won't break the bank.  I also look forward to possibly dining with my little guys and girl (dogs) here soon."}
{"text":"Soft opening is going well!  Great service, amazing staff,  strong management team and attention  to detail.  Dogs of course are welcome in the patio and have their own menu.   Great atmosphere and vibrant scene."}
{"text":"We had never had Lazy Dog before - and the food was incredible for the price. The day we went in, their order system was not working, and the only way we would have known was someone telling us. They did NOT miss a beat. Professional staff and great service by our server Ashley. The chicken pot pie was to die for and the burger was fresh tasting."}
{"text":"So many great things to say about this place ! Starting off with our server Amanda ! We had a 7 top table on a busy Saturday night and she was super attentive and very friendly . The menu was so hard to pick from because they have such a variety and everything sounded so yummy ! Started off with the sangria sampler although I enjoyed them all my favorite was the white peach. Then I finally picked the ribs my fiancé got the ranch cheeseburger , my friend a seared ahi and the other not sure as he inhaled it before anyone could say \"how is your food\" haha . My ribs were cooked great and the sauce was enough to get messy but not too much ! The mashed potatoes were delicious. Then we followed up with some desert I got the pumpkin cheesecake every bite was perfection ! The only thing I was sad about was that we didn't know dogs were welcomed on the patio ! We will definitely be going back and taking our dog max !"}
{"text":"It was great for brunch! I had a Bloody Mary and Banana foster french toast. Yum! Puppies welcome..."}
{"text":"Everything I order was good only bbq back ribs was overcooked and dry. Mix drinks was the best. I would love to go again. server was too sweet not to charge for bbq. Service"}
{"text":"Been here at least 4 times! We like the food there, and the atmosphere!  And you can even bring your fur-babies if you wish, they can eat there too! They also offer a doggie menuwhich I think is so cute! I'm a vegan, but I do seem to find something on their menu that I can eat. I only wish they could offer more vegan friendly item. Other then that, I think its a really good place to eat at. we always seemed to stop by after shopping there, even if it's simply for a glass of wine, or beer or some munchies! We have never had to wait long either which is nice!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location. A few weeks ago we left a 5 star review for the Town Square location which was our first time to the franchise.

We ordered the Sticky Ribs - 5 Stars
Sweet and Spicy Shrimp - 5 Stars
Chopped Cobb salad - 2 stars. Not as good as the one we ordered at the other location.

Server - Carrie - 5 Stars, over the top.

Kids walking their dogs in a circle around our outside table constantly - 1 Star

Will go back. Probably won't sit outside. I am good with having a seating area where you can bring your dog. This group however brought three dogs. Piss puddles and rice all over the patio. Kids walking the dogs around other peoples tables. The dog owners have no rules in place for their pet etiquette."}
{"text":"Came here twice with my boyfriend, one a week after they opened and again on Sunday night 10/16 at about 11pm. The first time we came, the servers were very nice but very slow. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes and the dinner took about another 20 after that. When the food did come, it was lacking flavor and tasted very cheap. We figured because it was a new place, maybe they were still trying to get the hang of things and so we cut them some slack and decided we would come back to Sunday. Fast forward to Sunday 10/16, we came for drinks and apps for happy hour. We were literally the only people in the restaurant other than the 2 people drinking at the bar. The drinks took 15 minutes and the appetizers took about 20 more minutes after that. We were the only customers there and it was absolutely ridiculous. The drinks were decent at best and the food was very bland and salty. After two tries of dining there, this place is definitely a flop. The name is very fitting because the entire experience felt very lazy from the food quality to service quality."}
{"text":"The food was bland. You can get much better food for competitive pricing at Tivoli. The service is what really earned them one star. It's as if the people working there have no desire to make your experience enjoyable. The fact that you can bring your dog should be a great attribute of the restaurant but overall makes the atmosphere chaotic and unenjoyable when all the dogs are barking at each other. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Below average pub food.  I ordered fish and chips and fish was hot but fries were cold.  Service was friendly but just OK.  I was surprised it was so busy on a weekday.  I wonder if I missed something worth the crowd.  I might give it another shot just but with a far superior restaurant just across the street... it might be hard."}
{"text":"Very nice place with excellent food, had lunch Fish and Chips,  not greasy just right.  Very nice to be able to have our dog with us on the terrace and a special menu for the dogs. 
I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"An amazing brunch and lunch menu offered on Sunday. They bring a lovely cold bowl of water for the fur babies. I did not have to wait very long for seating. This place has my favorite Bloody Mary! Quite a variety to eat and very affordable."}
{"text":"This a great place to try in Downtown Summerlin! In fact, this is one of my favorite go-to spots. I like to bring friends and family here. I enjoy the ambiance, the food, and the service.  The prices are right and I will continue to frequent this establishment. 

Let's get down to the details... 


Ambiance: 

Lazy Dog offers a casual and easy-going dining experience.
Dog inspired decor everywhere (don't forget to check out the restroom signs).  
They have a great patio that is dog friendly. 
Choose to sit on the patio. It is a great option in the Fall/Winter/Spring in Las Vegas (they have heaters for chilly nights)

Tip: Don't like dogs? Don't sit on the patio. 
 
Food: 

I've been here breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour. 
I've been happy with everything I've tried. 
I've tried a lot more than what I listed. 
I take coworkers, family and friends here. 
It's a solid crowd pleaser with an extensive menu. 
They speckle the menu with a few seasonal dishes to keep things fresh. 

Here are a few of my favorite items I've tried. 

Wild Blueberry Pancakes (brunch menu)
Yum. I really liked that they loaded it with blueberries (my favorite).

Beer Battered Fish n' Chips (lunch/main menu)
I've had it for lunch (smaller portion). I liked it and they even bring vinegar for my fries. It also comes with apple cider vinegar slaw. 

Butter Cake (sweet tooth menu)
This is a butter cake topped with a strawberry and mint compote with vanilla bean ice cream and splash of balsamic. It was fantastic! 

Edamame (small plates- main menu) 
It was  spicy and delicious with a hint of citrus notes. 

Seared Ahi Tuna (main menu)
This sesame Ahi Tuna Steak is served over mashed cauliflower (don't knock until you give it a whirl).  It's topped with a light coconut curry sauce and is under 500 calories. It's delicious! I've ordered this at least 3 times.. 


Hummus Trio (starter) 
This is exactly what you think it is. A trio of hummus. A walnut-pesto, sundried tomato and traditional classic hummus. These are served with toasted garlic bread , sliced cucumbers, and tomatoes. They will also bring more bread and veggies is you ask with a smile (say cheese).  


Cocktails: 
Moscow Mule:
This is a solid choice. This is what I normally order. 
I like the fact that they have a clean cocktail menu.
The clean cocktail menu offers tasty drinks that are low on calories/sugar. 
They have list of drinks under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. 


Wild Blueberry Lemon Drop:
Another one of their clean cocktails under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. I loved this drink, too! 

Mango Chile Margarita 
My Mom and Husband's go to when they're here. 


Service: 
Their service has always been super friendly and efficient. 
They usually have a manager walking the floor checking in on tables (always a welcomed gesture). Servers have always offered their opinion when asked to about their favorite menu items. 

Overall, this is a solid 4.5/5 star establishment in my book! 

Yelp Review #16 2016"}
{"text":"I was hoping this establishment would be more attentive to my very well mannered canine companion. 

Bugsy is a refined gentleman, who is accustomed to sitting on a chair next to mine or laying in my lap. We were told that due to health department regulations, he would have to sit on the ground. (We often dine out with him and this has never been an issue for us before.) Being a calm and sensitive rescue dog, the loud planes flying over head, constant stream of strangers stepping right next to him as they walked by and large dogs at nearby tables barking, he was very anxious, a little scared at times, and did not enjoy himself.

Bugsy really enjoyed his lunch from the dog menu, which consisted of chopped grilled chicken breast and brown rice. He was not given a water bowl, our waitress forgot his beverage. His face was covered in rice, and we were not given a napkin for him.

We really enjoyed the hummus plate and Cajun fries. My husband remarked that Bugsy had a better lunch than he did. He ordered a chicken and brown rice dish, his chicken had some chewy bites in it, but he choked it down. I ordered the cob salad, the lettuce was wilted and doused in a ton of dressing and the chicken also had chewy bites. The quality of the poultry is questionable and I was a little skeeved out by it. We were not offered drink refills.

The patio has a great atmosphere with a fire pit in the center. There were many beautiful dogs of all sizes, including a young Rottweiler and a wrinkly neopolitan mastiff puppy dining nearby, they were precious. I'm glad we finally got to dine at The Lazy Dog, but we probably won't be back, my dog did not enjoy it and I was disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"The dog menu is great! My Shephard gives the chicken and rice 4 stars. I do love the flatbread as an appetizer but the chicken in my parmigiana was burnt. I do not like my food overcooked nor burnt. The pasta and sauce were okay, nothing special. Cheesecake Factory is a million times better for chicken parm. I had a burger here a few weeks ago and it was great but on another occasion my Baja chicken lacked flavor. So I love this place because of the patio atmosphere with the dogs but for only myself I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"RASHANDA IS THE BEST SERVER AT LAZY DOG. Our food was delicious and was delivered in a reasonable time with a reasonable price. She was personable and ensured that our dining experience was as good as the food. New fave spot"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! The menu has a wide variety of choices to make anybody happy. I like to take my office out to lunch here. The outside patio is dog friendly and they will even bring a snack for your pooch. 

Great drink and beer menu with lots of unique things to try."}
{"text":"Do not let the five star reviews fool you!! They are most likely from employees and/or friends and family. With that being said.....

We met a few other couples here for dinner and it was very bad. The food is just okay but for us the service is just absolutely horrid! Orders were wrong, service was at a snails pace and just a cold atmosphere. 
One person in our group had to get up to go to the bar to order another round of drinks for our party cause out waitress was mia and never offered to get another round for our table. 
Everyone in our group left feeling like it was a huge waste of time and money.... Which it was!! So frustrating!!!

We will not return ever. Our experience was so bad. We felt like the staff could care less about the customers. 

Management has a huge fire to put out and I suggest they call in reinforcements."}
{"text":"It was packed, food was ok, service was good! It reminds me of yard house. It's a good place to take kids!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Excellent food and service. We went on a night when they were doing a charity event for a local school. The atmosphere was amazing
 The service fast and friendly. I understand they do alot of charity events. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"There is a song by The Pirates Of The Mississippi called Feed Jake. Part of the songs lyrics reads as follows:

\"Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog,
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake,
Feed Jake\"

Here's my suggestion, take Jake to The Lazy Dog. 

My wife and I went, just the two of us for lunch, to see how good this restaurant is with our two daughters, and maybe even one of our four dogs.

From the moment we entered, we were impressed. The decor was interesting to look at. The staff was friendly.

The menu, I don't know where to start. The options were great as well. My wife, she ate a BBQ Ranch Bacon Cheeseburger with Cajun Fries. I opted for a Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich topped with onion strings and blue cheese coleslaw. 

There is patio dining and if you care to, bring your four legged family member with you! I love this idea, we will return and when we do, one of our four dogs will come alone. Maybe the wife and I will bring the kids along too.

One complaint, after we ordered, I noticed \"ring stains\" from a cup or glass sitting on our table for too long. We arrived about 20 minutes after the restaurant  opened, so I am unsure how long the table had this \"ring stain\" on it, which leads me to wonder how long it had been since the table had been properly clean,

Who Let  The Dogs Out? Who cares? As long as the dogs were taken to The Lazy Dog for lunch!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in town and decided I need to get something to eat before got too late. It was a little after 3 PM when I arrive here at lazy dog restaurant reason I decided to come to this restaurant is I do travel with my little dog and he is treated here the same as any other customers. The place is clean, the service is fast and friendly and the drinks are strong. We arrive here and was promptly seated in the outdoor patio where they allow dogs to eat. The waiter and waitress, rot our drinks very fast and was nice to bring our dog some water that was ice cold. It was time to order our food, the dog was first up and then I ordered our food I have to say the food quality that the three different lazy dog restaurant we have been to has been outstanding.  There's not much we can say that we did not do here at this restaurant restaurant were very clean again the service was very fast and the patio is very cool and relaxing almost decided to take a nap with you highly recommend this location even with all the construction that was going on at the time of our life. We look forward to coming to this location again in the very near future."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries, beer. Atmosphere was just relaxing and what we needed. Our server Timijen was The Best. So friendly, took extra time to explain menu items to us. Would recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"At first glance, I was thinking, just another novelty over-hyped Summerlin 'must go because everyone else is' restaurant, you know the ones... I don't get the dog thing though. I have a dog, love dogs, but when I go out to eat, my dog stays home. At least they keep those who cannot be away from their dogs for an hour out on the patio. That being said, this review is for the food and it was pretty good.
To start, we tried:
1) calamari - Asian sweet style, unique in my book, not the typical fried with marinara stuff. Tasty!
2) Hummus sampler. Good hummus...not so good on the lack of bread for dipping. You don't get pita bread, you get some kind of super thin cracker...and very few of them at that, plus some sliced tomato and cucumbers, was more like a salad or something. I'll pass on this next time.
Main course, we tried:
1) I attempted to try the pulled pork sandwich but they were all out of pork (this was a Saturday around 630) either they don't make enough or it's that popular.I was told it'd be 20 minutes to make some more and I passed. Got the chicken sandwich, was okay, nothing great. Lacked flavor.
2) Margherita pizza. This was good. Nice crispy crust, good sauce, good cheese.

This is a noisy place, don't come here for a romantic dinner. Also, it seems really busy at the front reception, but wait times weren't all that bad, like 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Never have heard about this place before, came in to try something new and it was a hit!! The food is awesome and the happy hour drinks are even better. I would highly recommend to come and try this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food, great service!  Went there yesterday afternoon for lunch and our waiter was Alejandro.  He was very friendly and very knowledgable about the restaurant and the items on menu.  He suggested certain items for us to try so we did and they were delicious. 
He is a very hard worker, very friendly. The service he gives is actually one of the best I've had.   The restaurant has a bar & tables outside and you can even bring your dog.  They have a menu just for your pet.  Food was all made from scratch,  wide selection from appetizers to deserts.   I'll definitely be back for his service & some delicious food & beverages when he works."}
{"text":"We are here CONSTANTLY with our amazing border collie. Amazing food for both people and pets! There is not one item that I didn't absolutely love! And the servers are always amazing! We had Jen today and she was the absolute best! Very attentive and quick with whatever we needed! Definitely a regular place for me!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog was AMAZING! Came here for the first time today (Saturday afternoon) and had a wonderful experience. It wasn't too busy unlike the rest of town square, there was no wait at all. 
We got FREE Cajun fries (which was huge by the way) for checking in on yelp. 
I had the pot roast beef sandwich with street potato tots and it was really good. The bread on the sandwich was seriously delicious. My husband had the chicken curry with carrot slaw and he said it was awesome. We were so excited to eat our food that we forgot to take a pic for yelp... I guess we will have to come back! 
Our server Heather was super sweet and friendly and provided us with great service. Thanks heather! 
This place exceeded my expectations. Great food, great service and super nice restaurant overall. We will definitely be back for our next cheat meal!"}
{"text":"Love the Summerlin location!  Patio is nice and shaded. Dog friendly menu with choice of burger or chicken for for the pouches for $4.95. Their brunch menu is amazing, $5 mimosas & $5 bloody Mary's (the peach mimosa and spicy Bloody Mary taste @amazing!)
We've been to the town square location also, this one is by far better service!!! I wouldn't even bother going to the town square location, make the drive to come to this one."}
{"text":"It was another guys night out with fellow Baristas. We have been talking about it for quite some time and decided to try it out. I personally knew about it but never got the chance to try it out even though their first Vegas location in Downtown Summerlin is much closer to my house.

Upon entering, the first impression was the similarities with Yard House and Claim Jumper with a rustic log cabin setting. A cool thing about Lazy Dog is the seating arrangement, makes it ideal for large groups. We had the pleasure of being served by Heather. She was very engaging and service was on point. The food was not mind blowing but good comfort food. A good option for a large group since there is good variety of food, from Italian to Asian dishes to please everyone.

For starters, we got the Cajun Fries. It was good just a tad bit on the salty side but the Chipotle Ranch dipping sauce was pretty good. Another appetizer we got was the Ahi Poke Jar, which was by far the dish we enjoyed the most. The fresh Ahi Tuna was balanced and flavorful with peanut like dressing and paired with crispy wonton chips was a cool concept from your usual spinach artichoke dishes at other chain restaraunts. A few of us got pastas, one got an Asian dish and myself went for the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich. We enjoyed everything including the fact we had a few drinks and shots with our meals to De-Stress from a week of working. 

Overall we had a great time. A cool place to hangout with friends. There is a saying that it's always about, \"Timing.\" A cool thing happen on this particular night 12.4.16, when our group was included in a company wide mannequin challenge, which we all decided to hop on and was added to the video shoot. We were able to view the video and was told that it will be posted on Lazy Dog social media platform. So were hoping it will go viral! :) Diffenitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped into Lazy Dog on a Thursday night during happy hour (9pm-close). Happy hour is only served in the bar and patio area. We got 2 beers ($1 off drafts) and two Asian pear martinis ($6). The food specials for happy hour range from $3 to $8. We took advantage of the free order of cajun fries for checking into yelp. The portion size is very large and served with a code of chipotle ranch. We also ordered wings ($5) and the \"All American\" burger (ala carte for $5).

I overall enjoyed all of the food and drinks and will definitely be back to try more!

Worthy mention: if you have a friendly dog, you are allowed to dine with them on the patio!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I really gave this place a chance because I went here twice and both experiences, the food was an easy C-. First time around I ordered the spicy Thai chicken salad. When it arrived at the table, it looked like they had opened a store bought bag of $.99 mixed lettuce and mixed it up with salad dressing. Second time around I had the Turkey burger. It really was nothing to write home about, or recommend. The only plus side about this place is their craft beers are decent and my coconut mojito was really good once I got past the rotting pieces of mint floating around in my drink that I fished out with my spoon. However, I will give an A+ for my dog's food as she seemed to love it and I was very happy to find a place that we could bring her with a nice patio. Unfortunately, not happy enough to come back a 3rd time because the food quality here is lacking. I wanted to like this place, so much so, we gave it a second chance. Maybe they should minimize their menu and focus on better food quality."}
{"text":"Food is great, unfortunately this is my second time here and for the second time the greeting and host staff leave much to be desired. In a positive note food and server staff is good and does make up for the first impression. Dog menu is great and music and atmosphere top notch!!!!"}
{"text":"Called in here to make a reservation for 8 people when it says they take reservations but I was not allowed to make one? How does this make any sense don't say you take reservations and then not allow me to make one and then hang up on me not going to go here anymore for the fact that bailey was really rude about it over the phone"}
{"text":"Everything we had was excellent. I had the Hawaiian poke and cucumber salad. My son had the French Toast which was absolutely delicious. My daughter had the noodles. My husband had the Mahi Mahi. I have never before seen my kids clean their plates the way that they did here. It was so good! The pumpkin cheesecake was to die for! The service was spot on."}
{"text":"Everything from the hostess that greeted us, to our service, to the manager, very unpleasant.
Our food took forever to get, and when it was finally  delivered the warm items were cold. 
Impossible to get refills or any service of this matter. 
Food was nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here for some dinner and were seated on one of the high tables. The place was quite busy for a dinner time but not overly. We waited 15mins for a waitress to come by, but to no avail. Another group were sat at the same time as us and were seen to, ordered and started to receive food and we were still not being acknowledged so we moved to a different area for hope a different server could dissipate our rumbling stomachs! After another long 10mins the manager could see I was frustrated and came over to take our order. After about 45 mins we finally got some food and it was ok. Standard for a bar and definitely not worth the wait. Next time I'll be cutting my losses and trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Took an hour to have our food ready. Food was cold. No apologies from the server. This place is a NOPE."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio with fire pit., dogs allowed but can be rambunctious.  Ordered buffalo cauliflower and nachos. Cauliflower cooked perfectly and tasty. Nachos terrible. Service beyond slow even when not busy."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Place is ok. It's nice to bring the dogs there. Patio area is really nice with a fire pit in the middle of it all. Only 2 tv's outside so game would be kind of hard to watch depends on where you are sitting. I truly prefer Bj's across the street. Service was good the atmosphere is nice just hope the food gets better. Maybe it's what o had ordered. I would try it again."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks, great atmosphere! This place is hands down one of my favorite places to go. Service is always exceptional also. Our server Jimmy was very personable and knowledgeable on the menu, answering any questions we had while having a few laughs as well. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just had another great experience at the Lazy Dog. Great food  (Sicilian meatballs oh my!) and amazing service (thank you DARIA you were spectacular!) I love this place...xoxo"}
{"text":"The beers were okay, had the house red ale and ipa. The chicken salad was great but the bread used for the sammies was dry and fell apart. I ventured out and tried the sweet potato tots. They were too sweet and I wouldn't order them again but the Chipotle aioli was good. Tomato bisque soup was also good and flavorful.

Service was fast, but seemed to be too busy with whatever, to come by our table to check up on us.

LOVED the outdoor seating and that they allow dogs out there.

Room for improvement."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing sunset during the our first visit to Lazy Dog...outdoor seating NBA playoff game on top was the making of a fantastic night. Our meal only made it better, we started with a garlic cheese sundried tomatoes dip for an appetizer...wow, bang and pop, yum and so good! We then had a black and blue cheese pizza and an asian teriyaki salmon and rice dish....crazy good! best salmon i have ever eaten...and i live on the pacific beach and know my fish. 
Our waitress Arizona (yep she is named just like the state) was super friendly and was on point with fantastic service...i cannot say enough good things, tonight was was wonderful night because of Lazy Dog cafe."}
{"text":"Guys, you no longer have to waste your time on dating apps. If you want to meet a girl, bring a puppy to the outdoor patio and wait no more than a minute or two before you meet 10 new people. Or, if you want to just meet other dog owners in general. But seriously, Lazy Dog is a dog and dog owners' heaven. There's a sign forewarning that if you're not canine-friendly, then you should probably sit indoors. But sitting outside was really fun seeing all types of furry friends out and about. 

As for the food, the menu is huge and it really got to the point where I had no idea what to order. It did remind me of a dog-friendly version of Cheesecake Factory with its choice of pastas, salads, and sandwiches. I ended up sticking with the carbonara, which came with a generous helping of bacon, romano, and a perfectly poached egg on top. 

Some of the smaller plates attempt to make healthy items taste better with some fat and grease, include the buffalo cauliflower and sweet potato tater tots with roasted jalapeno-lime aioli. Or you could just not care about what you're eating and just go for the mac & cheese, which features 5 cheeses with bacon topped with a green onion crumble (slightly healthy?). 

The food was decent, but you really come for the atmosphere, which is a perfect place to take all dogs on a carefree day."}
{"text":"Run! Don't walk to Lazy Dogs!! 
All food & cocktails are made from scratch, from sauces to their simple syrups and grenadine..
I had a champagne mojito and was sad when it was gone!  The American Burger was juicy and flavorful, the chicken teriyaki was perfect and not too sweet.. The kids meal portions were large, and the brownie dessert was incredible...  We liked the prices too... 2 adult entrees, 3 child entrees drinks, a cocktail and dessert for around $50."}
{"text":"Synopsis: 
    Arrived at 5pm. Place was empty. Usually a warning sign for somewhere brand spankin' new. But I've had Lazy Dog in Cali twice and it's always been decent. So let's begin the hostess was great. Very friendly, robotic nature, cool it's expected in these kind of establishments (aka Chains). 
    We have a party of four and get sat at a booth (my preferred seating for 4 or more) great! Then our server comes by and she's happy well presented and friendly. My dad didn't really know what to order and she gave a load of great options. My dad took her advice on the Carne Asada. And he said it was good. All the food was good and nothing was bad by all means. But nothing was a \"Wow effect\" either. Good food for a god price. The dessert was awesome. We got the Warm Apple Crumble with ice cream. FLAME!
OVERALL: 3.5/5

Cons/Things I noticed:
- the table had crumbs on it when we sat down. Hostess scooped it quickly 
- someone else's food got dropped at our table but our sever came by quickly and said NO! Wrong table! 
- The plates they gave us for appetizers were very spotty and smudgy 
- they were out of big container to go boxes

Seems like a leadership thing. The team needs a stronger leader to get things in precise shape!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog is new in September. They have an awesome menu. The Ahi Poki Jar appetizer is fantastic!!
Great bar, Kevin is way cool. 
Their house beers are quality. 
There's a lot to choose from in Vegas but this place is worth it."}
{"text":"My sister, best friend and I decided we wanted to try somewhere different for dinner in the Summerlin area. I got a little lost at first but I eventually found the restaurant after I called the restaurant and clarified where is the location. The restaurant is actually located towards the back of the Downtown Summerlin Mall, closer to Red Rock Hotel and Casino.

It was a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. We were sat pretty much right away. This is the place to go if you want to bring your dogs because it's dog friendly and they even have an outside area to dine. We didn't bring any dogs though, so we sat inside. 

The menu had many options from appetizers, burgers/sandwiches, pastas, salads. I ordered a Ahi Tuna Burger with fries on the side and it was delicious. The waitress was honest and nice; she also gave us some recommendations since it was our first time there. I would definitely come back if I was around the area and would like to try something new from the menu."}
{"text":"Let me tell you ... This is the place to be! We were greeted by an awesome team member and then greeted by Jose the manager. He was by far one of the nicest and sweetest managers, so personable and surprised us with a complimentary nachos which were to Die for !! 

This is the place to be and by far the best customer service!"}
{"text":"I thought the drinks were better than the food, but it was OK. I had a stir fry dish that wasn't hot enough in spice level or in temperature coming from the kitchen. The rice had no stickiness to it either. I would try something different next time.

There are a lot of options, but this smacks of one of those places that serves everything and specializes in nothing. Their top shelf margarita was good and they have a mojito with coconut rum that was very refreshing. The positive here is that you can take a family and there will be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great menu! Great for kids! Wonderful service with treats afterwards! We will be back for happy hour or brunch!"}
{"text":"I returned to this location after followup with a manager, and I feel a lot better about the service here. As usual, the food is craft made and very delicious. Our waitress, Carol, was upbeat and helpful from the moment we walked in. She made sure to be attentive to the table and check up on us often. I wish I had this experience the first time. We ordered Buffalo Chicken Pops, Nachos, Pizza, Chicken Parmesan, Thai salad, cajun fries, and a flatbread. The flatbread was PHENOMENAL. It was by far my favorite thing. Simple, yet the flavors were wonderful. The cajun fries are awesome with Chipotle ranch. I was impressed with the nachos, as well. The food is quality for the price. The manager, Jose, stopped by our table to introduce himself and made sure everything was satisfactory. We had a much better experience this time and very much appreciate the extra care that staff took."}
{"text":"My food tonite was amazing ! Hamburger was so good and the pot roast sandwich whatever it was called was more amazing. Our waitress was the best part!!! Katrina was one of the best waitresses I have ever had at a restaurant! She was on top of all of us.... drinks and all.... she was great !!! Def would come back here"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was excellent and so was service.  Ahi Poke, Hatch Chili Mac & Cheese, Black & Bleu Burger with Cajun Fries were all great!  Shaun was a great server and will come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The night we went was windy, so we sat inside.  We had an awesome server named Heather.  She kept our drinks filled and helped with menu choices.  We ordered the cajun fries (free with yelp checkin) and she noticed immediately that the food runner brought them to the table without the ranch sauce, so she got us a side of ranch and chipotle ranch to dunk them.  The fries were nice and crispy, just a little over seasoned for my taste.  I had a healthy Thai chicken salad that was large enough for me to take home half for lunch the next day.  My brother had the black and blue burger, which was also very large and was lunch the next day.  Our skinny brother had the baby back ribs and cleaned his plate.  The location is awesome and I will leave ore time for shopping on my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch few days ago.  I arrived at the area a bit early before my friend did but went ahead inside anyways and as soon as I entered the door - the hosts, who were standing at their podium saw me walked in but they didn't even acknowledge me, they didn't even asked If I have a table reserved or if I have been helped or even just to say hello. So I decided to just sit on the bench by the door while I waited for my friend. Its not that I wanted the attention I just thought they should acknowledge/greet anyone that  walks in to their venue.  Other than that,  our server was great, she was very nice and always came to  check on us to see If we needed anything. I ordered steak and it was perfect but I think I loved the dessert more which was white chocolate chip  brownie with vanilla ice cream...it was so good....I give it a four star just because the people at the door weren't as cordial as they should be. Cant wait to take our dog here..."}
{"text":"Just wanted to put an update here since we visit Lazy Dog so often. I think I highly underrated Jen in my last review because we were excited every time she was our server! She moved to the Town Square location which is closer to our house so we love seeing her there now.

My only negative feedback is that they have gotten quite a bit of new staff at this location (summerlin) and they are far more lackluster, besides a few gems. We have had the same hostess greet us at least 4 times and she does anything but greet us. She usually stares at us blankly and waits for us to talk... she doesn't ask us preference or ask anything about happy hour seating or make any friendly conversation. A greeter should make you feel welcome, excited, and accommodated from the second you walk through the doors and every moment till you're sat where the server takes over. None of those things happened and we almost feel like we're inconveniencing her. 

Back to the positive though - the food and atmosphere overall are still great and we've had plenty of positive experiences with some of the servers too!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been 3 times and it has been great everytime. Service and just the all around attitude of the employees is great. Food is also good some things we didn't like but that I think is just do to taste but most things we like especially brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Huge portions!! Great service!! Extremely Pet friendly!! Before we were even waited on the waitress was already bringing out water bowls for our 3 dogs. Which is a huge plus for animals lovers like us. We travel everywhere with our pets so always looking for places they can go too. This will now be one of our regular places in Vegas. Highly recommended the fried chicken dinner."}
{"text":"Saturday on the patio was lovely. We decided for the nachos and split a burger. The nachos (pictures posted) were far and few between. Couldn't find cheese or chicken. Chips didn't even fill the plate. We usually order and share but that was not the case today. If it wasn't for the extra jalepenos we would have just had chips with tomatillo salsa on top with the 10 black beans. We started a game of counting the beans. The All American burger was OK. Thin for a half lb burger. We both like the crunch of fresh lettuce. Well that didn't happen.  See picture.  

Lazy Dog is usually pretty good but today they were just Lazy."}
{"text":"We had a large group scheduled for happy hour on the patio but the weather turned and we would not have wanted to sit there! The manager, Scooby, called me, rearranged the reservation and had a table set up for us when we arrived. The food, drink and service were excellent! Thanks, Scooby!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the happy hour too! Come here often and love Wendy the Bartender. She's always great and takes care of us each time we are in. Great good, great drinks, great prices..."}
{"text":"mMonica was amazing. Very great service! Great food! She is more than a 5 star!!! She gave us free cajun fries for checking in yelp! That was awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"A fun spot with decent food!!
Their bbq burger is super good. Surprisingly loved their hand dipped beef battered fish and chips.
I like to start out with their grizzly fries, hush puppies, or lettuce wraps 


You better save room for dessert because the butter cake is insanely good. I love a la mode desserts"}
{"text":"When you put dogs, delicious food, and I together in a bar, you basically put me in heaven, so thank you. This was my first time here, around happy hour. First off, love the happy hour prices/choices. I went with a friend and we ordered a round of appetizers and a pitcher of white peach sangria for $15 which I highly recommend!! Alright now, the food. THE FOOD. The hummus is creamy and flavorful with soft, warm pita bread. The buffalo chicken lollipops are basically chicken bites on a stick, but you can't go wrong with that! Order the sauce on the side if you're weary of spice. We also tried the hush puppies and sweet potato tater tots. Both delicious and the hush puppies are served with a zesty sauce! I wish I brought my dog, but I think my next visit I will so I can try the dog menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the rare opportunity to have a date night--we've been to the Summerlin area multiple times and have been wanting to try this for a while now.

First, food was amazing. Food definitely was well prepared and has superb flavor. I had the pork shank--a seasonal item--and my wife got the flat iron steak. We also got the buffalo cauliflower--again seasonal--and we finalized with the huckleberry apple pie (seasonal again:)). It wasn't bland or overpowering but came out hot and fresh with plenty of flavor. I could tell their kitchen takes pride in what they do.

Service wise, it was a tad slow. I'll give them benefit of the doubt as it was on an off night but everyone we interacted with was friendly. 

The restaurant was well decorated and the atmosphere warm. Plenty of items on the menu but it wasn't overpowering.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner. Ambience was nice, but our servers changed multiple times which was a little confusing. I checked in and received free Cajun fries with our order & they're surprisingly really good and well seasoned. However, the rest of the food arrived a bit later, which was understandable since it was busy. In addition, we waited almost an hour for my mom's order only to find out that the order was never even put in in the first place. By the time the server decided to check up on us to see if we were ready for the check, the rest of us were already finished eating so we decided it was inconvenient to reorder my mom's food. Tipped 20%, but was not happy at all with the almost nonexistent service. Glad I'm not from the area, because I for sure won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the time we walked in. Love the decor and the atmosphere. Our waiter Daniel was awesome. Very attentive and kept our drinks coming. We then had more people show up so we moved tables and Caitlin became our new server. She is awesome. I love how if you order a drink or food and didn't like it, they take it back no hassle. We ordered the Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts and a pasta dish they were all phenomenal. I just wish they would have better happy hour times especially in the c
Bar area. Do it for the locals. I will definitely be back for the food, drinks and awesome service"}
{"text":"Ummm yes this place is the best! Of course because I love dogs and it's so cute that there are dogs out on the patio and even a doggie menu... but the people menu is actually delicious! I've been three times now and tried different stuff each time- all delicious. The atmosphere is nice and the employees seem to all be in good moods with great service."}
{"text":"I came here to drop of some toys for the Yelp's Toys for Tater Tots.  It was mid-afternoon and there were few people inside and two or three tables used on the patio.

I ordered the chicken curry bowl for my lunch/dinner.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled without needing to ask.  The menu describes the bowl in this way:  Chicken and vegetables, slow-cooked in our scratch made coconut curry, served over steamed white or brown rice with our fiery carrot slaw.  The carrot slaw was not fiery to my taste but it did have some red pepper sesame oil poured on the carrot thins and it was very good.  You have the option of white or brown rice and I chose brown.  The curry chicken had a good curry flavor and the serving size was very generous.

Throwing caution to the wind (when don't I?) I ordered dessert--the Simms Family S'more.  The menu describes it thusly:  ...this house favorite is made with layers of rich chocolate fudge, graham cracker crust, peanut butter and warm brownie, topped with a giant, fire-roasted, housemade marshmallow and crushed peanuts.

The s'more was OK but I'd get a different dessert the next time.  The chocolate was very good but the marshmallow was a bit of a challenge.  Since it's one thick piece of marshmallow, you have to attack it with your spoon, hold it up off the dish, and wait for the lower part to slowly drop away.  It was a bit of a challenge using just the spoon.  It was tasty but I never like fighting with my food.

Service was outstanding.  What would normally me a 3 star review earned the fourth star with the friendliness of the staff.  Although it was a rather slow time, I'm guessing it's generally that way.  

Close to home and a good selection, I'll be back."}
{"text":"LOVE how this place is SUPER dog friendly :) It's like a doggy social :) They even give them their own doggy bowls for water and food (must bring your own dog food, however). 
There wasn't anything special about their all American cheeseburger. It was basically a regular cheeseburger on fancy brioche bread. The Cajun fries had flavor, but it seemed a little stale. You really had to bite into the fries to consume it. Not really a fan of their strawberry lemonade as well. I had to switch to a Sprite. 
However, The roast beef dip sandwich was to die for. The aju sauce was on point. My girlfriend almost died eating it, it was that good. 
On the down side, the hostesses there were rude. It was our first time there, and they looked at us like we were idiots. We asked them 3 questions for about a couple minutes, standing aimlessly in the lobby, and they didn't answer is AT ALL. Finally when they gave us the time of day, they didn't even answer the questions we initially asked. 
Despite the fact, I'd give them another shot. I absolutely love that it was a dog friendly establishment. I'd like to try them during happy hour :)"}
{"text":"I just received the most incredible service from a wonderful woman named Amy out on the patio. She knew the menu backwards and sideways and was incredibly patient with my group. Thank you Amy! You totally sold me on this place!"}
{"text":"Volle Punktzahl, waren dreimal dort und jedes Mal zufrieden mit dem Essen, Bedienung schnell auf aufmerksam und Toiletten sauber. So mögen wir das, gerne wieder jederzeit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a lot.. they were on point! Eric help us on and he was Johnny on the spot too.. Good night at the dog!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the last week and had a fabulous time. The food is delicious and we were able to bring our 2 old English sheepdogs and they even got a bowl of chicken and rice. This is by far our new favorite place to drink and eat. If you have dogs or are a dog lover this is a place for you. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The chicken dinner had a great taste, but the menu does not specify what type of meat. I received a thigh which normally they'll ask or a chicken breast. My corn was cold. There was only one waitress serving the entire restaurant and that was frustrating. We informed the manager of my concerns and he offered a free appetizer, but I live in Houston."}
{"text":"Foods good. They have a nice size happy hour menu for food and drinks. Im younger so I always tend to get the worse service at places. This one is no dif. People want 20 percent tip but only want to do 2 percent of the work"}
{"text":"I've been twice already this week...enough said. 

What a cool joint! Great ambiance. Big patio with giant fire pit. Very doggy friendly. There were lots of doggy diners...looked to me like they served them bowls of water and brown rice. How cute! 

I'm not familiar with the lazy dog chain...apparently there are 15 in California. It's a very family friendly, bustling, tasty, affordable restaurant. 

During my 2 visits thus far, I've had the sausage mushroom bisque, hatch chile and bacon Mac and cheese, loaded baked potato hush puppies, poblano chicken, hummus and chicken salad, rhubarb crumble, Jamaican lemonade, and cucumber thyme lemonade. The lemonades are fun and not too sweet at all which I love! The Jamaican lemonade comes with a fun little squeezer of coconut milk. Both are served with a trendy chevron straw. The bisque is absolutely delicious. Creamy and scrumptious. A bowl is huge. Easily enough for a meal. The poblano chicken was packed with flavor. It is served with corn cakes and loads of peppers and onions. The Mac and cheese was tasty but salty; very cheesy. The hummus chicken salad was a conundrum. A very eclectic mix of ingredients. The salad part was disappointing. Cheap wilty shredded lettuce. The grilled chicken with walnut pesto part was delicious. Moist and flavorful. The sun dried tomato hummus and pita were yummy too. All these things combined with balsamic and tomatoes- just so strange. The rhubarb crumble was absolutely delicious and massive! It could easily feed 4 people. Warm, gooey, tart and divine. 

The bill was shockingly low each time. Very affordable and they do a fine job. Service was great on both occasions. Attentive, sincere, outgoing. I'll go again for sure....maybe again this week!"}
{"text":"Blah. Service sucks! Sitting at the bar and 15 mins later we haven't been acknowledged. Writing this review as I'm staring at the bartender and manager."}
{"text":"So this is probably the favorite hang out for a close friend and I and we are here frequently (ie too much), however the last 3 times we have stopped in the fire pit on the patio hasn't been working. This is a huge bummer as it's still winter and that's one of the biggest reasons we come here...what's even more frustrating is that this has been over the course of a month. We had to leave early and go inside tonight because we simply couldn't enjoy ourselves on the patio in the cold :( I would come back when the fire pit is working...but I probably will go somewhere else until then. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Food quality could have been better. Like apple bees with a little more hype to it. Servers were all nice. The hostess could work on giving more warm welcoming."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I waited maybe a good 30 minutes until our food came out due to our orders going to the wrong table. The new manager later told us desert was on them but to our surprise, our waiter explained to us how they do things differently for customers around here and put the whole meal on the house on top of free desert. Just amazing food with amazing customer service !!  Will definitely be back next time I drop by Vegas"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! We ordered fish and chips and the French dip. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Love this hidden little gem in our great valley with wonderful service, food, and dining with our doggie's what could be better! I have enjoyed eating at this local haunt many times with so many great dining experiences. This particular trip here was no different. Today I made it in time to enjoy happy hour too. 

The service here is always superb with some of the best bartenders in the valley. The drinks that they service always are too shelf and they are strong too. The server pointed the way to the bar and I seated myself there. The decor in the restaurant is so relaxing but upscale. The bartender came over right away and left the menu and took my drink order. The ordering process was excellent with no issues. The food came real quick too.

I absolutely love their menu here with so many different offerings it is the comfort foods that win here. Sitting in the bar area is very comfortable and the music selections that they play soothe any fire that one might have. It gets replaced with relaxing music and surroundings. It's a great place to eat and really enjoy the experience of the food in an excellent atmosphere.

I ordered the pink lemon drop martini who ever thought that pink lemons could taste so sweet. The Yelp check in I took advantage of as well. Thanks Lazy Dog for the Cajun boost with ranch. Yes the fries were hot but the burn was oh so great! Also have been craving cauliflower recently so decided on this too. It is really spicy and will clear all your sinuses up. Yeah for the hot!"}
{"text":"Five Stars for service, Zero stars for food!

This review is based only on my experience at the bar for Happy Hour only.

It's not possible to convey how we feel about this establishment with a Star Rating, because the review must be broken down into several, yet extremely opposite parts.

We went to Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar for the first time yesterday.  The atmosphere and restaurant is very pleasant.

The staff, bartenders and manager provide five star services.  I have to say that they are great and the management should be proud of every one of them. However we were very disappointed with the happy hour food.
 
We had three selections; Wings, Calamari, and Nachos.
My opinion is that this restaurant completely dropped the ball here. The chef tried, but terribly failed with the preparation, taste and presentation of the Calamari.  It tasted like they opened a bag of frozen calamari, fried it, threw some Asian sauce on it and presented it over rice.  Wow!  This was not good at all.  

 I ordered the chicken nachos; unfortunately I was violently ill for 12 hours immediately after consuming this dish.

 I feel badly that I have to write about this but I think it's in the best interest of my fellow readers.  Hopefully the Lazy Dog will be more careful with what they serve.   I wanted this place to be a home run and it was just the opposite. 

Fantastic service cannot overcome terrible food.  I hope they will improve and consider reviewing the menu and putting in place a better system to monitor safety and quality in their kitchen."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. Sat on the patio after a 5-10 minute wait. The fans made it feel comfortable out there considering it was 102 degrees. Service was friendly and prompt. Started with the Wok-Fired Calamari. It was delicious! Not traditional style. Tasted like Kung Pao over rice. Will order that every time. 

We ordered brunch/lunch after that. The soups and salads were pretty standard. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and was very juicy. Seems like something they do well consistently. Also had the Country Chicken and Biscuits off of the brunch menu. It was hearty and savory. Great dish for a late breakfast. 

Really enjoyed the experience overall. Draft selection was impressive for a restaurant. Will definitely sit on the patio again. Fans for the summer and fire pit for the winter."}
{"text":"I have to give this place two stars because the food and the drinks are good quality and that has been true at all the Lazy Dog Restaurants we've been to in So-Cal. But the food was the only reason for a decent rating.

We walked over here after being incredibly let down by the \"Farmer's Market\" across the street, and much to our surprise we were seated immediately. 

The hostess was very friendly and personable! She talked to us about our day, about some menu items and was all in all great! I wish she had been out waitress! After we were seated our waitress who was nice, but not memorable came and took our orders:

Drinks:

Bloody Mary
Jamaican Lemonade

Appetizers:

Garlic Flatbread  

Lunch:

Baja Burger W/Cajun Fries
Warm Chicken Focaccia 

Drinks were 5/5 I would definitely recommend the Jamaican Lemonade!

Appetizer: 5/5 but we substituted Ranch instead of the marinara.

Lunch: 3/5 The Burger was great but huge and messy and the Chicken Focaccia had a bunch of hard dried up pieces of chicken in it like it had been sitting under the heat lamp too long, which would make sense given the fact that we had to wait almost forty minutes for our food to come out.

I love Lazy Dog as a brand but I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a goood ole pub/grill place that gives you the feeling you're happy to be an American! It's your total American restaurant with goood burgers that are so juicy, tangy, crunchy, and delicious.the fries are there too to help you get through the ride. The salty is so good and with nice side of ketchup to dip them in. My mouth is already watering like going to splash mountain and getting totally soaked.

Great burgers great place to eat"}
{"text":"I had to get home get loose pants on before I could even think clearly enough to write a review! I ATE SO MUCH FOOD! This was our late Valentine's day dinner.
Okay I'll get real. This is now one of my new favorites. We just so happened to come in on happy hour. Woot woot! He ordered a draft Coors light and i ordered the sampler. If you get in on the happy hours I highly suggest ordering the lazy dog sampler! Delicious! My favorite was the stout! Very smooth very satisfying like coffee. 
We ordered the nachos, fire roasted pizza with sausage and chilli oil, mac n'cheese, and the stuffed hush puppies.  Now at the start of the night I already new I wanted nachos so I might be biased, but those were some killer nachos! Next their hush puppies were terribly good! Mashed potatoes breaded and fried. Very good. The pizza should have been a lower price but very good. The mac n'cheese was almost good. Didn't really hold up to everything else. We ate everything! After all that I ordered a lazy dog stout and dessert. I ordered the s'mores and he ordered what is so highly recommended by Yelp and by the waitresses, the butter cake. The butter cake pales in comparison to the s'mores! Omg it's like my favorite thing now even as full as I already was! That marshmallow!! Heavenly!
The service could have been better. Now this place is pretty big but it was nearly empty. The waitress didn't come by nearly as often as she should have and she took far too long to bring me my beer. I was done with desert by the time she brought it though I ordered it before we ordered dessert. Very uncool. Then we waited far too long for her to pick up our check. Also as i said this place was nearly empty yet we were seated across or next to the waiters station. So we got to listen to their talk and so on all night. That was ridiculous since the whole place was clear for seating. It's literally 3 feet at the most from your table so all these waiters and waitresses are on your lap all night yet we didn't get the attention we should have. :-/
So the food is an absolute 5 stars and the service about a 4 star. 
We left happy and ready for bed! O.~"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Omar recommended the sticky the sticky ribs and they were on on point."}
{"text":"Everthing here is 5 star!  The atmosphere, the music, the staff and the food are all top notch!  We have the best waiter...Miles!  If you're looking for a great meal and good vibes this is the place!"}
{"text":"Always love this place though tonight was extra amazing.  Our bartender Eric recommended the street carrots ( heirloom carrots with queso blanco) and the BBQ chicken pizza and both were amazing.  Eric also made sure our drinks were served promptly and water was always full."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has great food and the cocktails are really good. Happy hour is the best. The bar area is nice and good number of TVs to watch all the different sports on. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The place has plenty of parking and it's very big inside so plenty of tables. They have so many choices on the menu that I'll need to go back to try them all."}
{"text":"I think this place & location is really good, especially if you're a dog lover & like eating out.

Went here for dinner, for my friend's dog's birthday.. we had a \"bark-day paw-ty\" at the Lazy Dog! It wad really nice how accommodating the staff was for the celebration. You can order a bowl of beef or chicken with rice for the dogs. Seating with your pet is outdoors. Because it was dinner, the weather was nice sitting outside, not too hot in Sept.

Had the Campfire Pot Roast & Ceviche Tostadas.. both were so good! The Pot Roast was tender, the meat just fell apart easily & it meshed well with the spinach & mashed potato. The ceviche was fresh & light, a good appetizer - 3 tostadas an order.

I hear the other locations have great tasting food & service. For this being my first time, it was definitely a nice experience. Planning on going back to try their Brunch menu."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight, visiting from Texas. Our server Jennifer was excellent. She was friendly, knowledgeable and knew just how to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. Food was great! My son had the bison meatloaf and it was excellent. My husband had the chicken salad walnut sandwich and it was great, large portions too! My daughter in law and I shared a pizza and it was so good. Jose the manager came by twice to see his we liked it. Jennifer decided to treat us to a dessert and we shared the butter cake topping with ice cream and strawberries. Very good!!
I highly recommend this restaurant. We were treated like VIP's??"}
{"text":"We were a large group,  10, and this restaurant does not do large groups well. Over an hour and 20 minutes until entrees arrived, several members waited 20 minutes for their drinks. Part of my order was barely warm and when I said something was told from the kitchen that's how it is supposed to be.  Felt sorry for waiter but after a while looked like he was avoiding us out of embarrassment.  I live out of town and was visiting friends,  would never return,  too many good places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Nice atmosphere and the food was on par. I had the teriyaki chicken and the wife had some healthy pasta thingy that was good as well. The drinks were all good and the server was friendly. Just felt bad for my close friend who was doubling with us that his steak tasted like a T.G.I. Fridays steak and they brought him an empty A-1 bottle hahaha. Oh well! Pretty good place though!"}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation for 7 and I get it, it's new and busy and said they couldn't take any more reservations, they said to call ahead and more then likely it should be ok. We ended up going shopping at Downtown Summerlin so we go in early and they said I would still have to call, literally just step aside the host desk and call. I told them it would be for 7 and then they said they were only accommodating for 5. The hostess was condescending and kept tilting her head and smiling. I told them I spoke to someone yesterday and they said well things change, continuing to tilt her head. I do want to try the food because I have heard good things about the food, so hopefully my next experience will be better."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night. We sat on the outdoor patio because the bar was full. The craft beer selection is good. They have Happy Hour M-F 3-6 and Sat/Sun after 9:00. They allow dogs on the patio. Service is a little slow, but friendly. There are employees and servers everywhere yet somehow, you can't seem to find yours. The menu is like they couldn't make up their mind of what they wanted to be when they grew up. We had calamari, chicken tortilla soup, salad, pesto chicken pasta, steak salad and beers. They're heavy handed on the salad dressing. The garnish was bland. The pesto chicken was excellent, the steak on the salad was tender and well cooked, the calamari tasted like sweet and sour chicken and the soup was underwhelming. Overall, it was a nice meal in a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"We decided to come here right in the middle of the Sunday brunch rush on the first day of spring (3/20/16). The sun was out and it was about 80 degrees so we weren't surprised to see the crowd gathered in front of the patio/waiting area.  I decided to go in anyway to see what the wait was like.  The hostess asked if we wanted inside or outside, since we were dogless and was really just looking for a place for a quick bite and cocktail, I said inside.  She said the bar is open, self seating with full menu or we can wait about 10 min for a table in the main dining room.  I took the bar offer and realized there were plenty of seating inside, everyone just had their dogs so needed to wait to be sat on the patio.  
The inside was still nice and had a good vibe so I was happy with not having to wait.  We started out with 2 orders of \"Hair of the Dog\" Bloody Mary's on the brunch menu ($5/each) and from the full menu ordered the 1/2 soup and salad.  The soups you get choose from is either chicken tortilla or the seasonal special which was cream of asparagus.  The salad you get the choice of is either Caesar, wedge or house greens.  
When our lunches arrived we were surprised how big the portions were.  The salads were served on a good size plate and the soup was more of a bowl then a cup.  This soup/salad combo came out to $7.95 each with the exception of my boyfriends tortilla soup + avocado which $1 was charged.    This wasn't a big shock though since Chipotle charges .50 for guac and avocados can be pretty pricey.
The bartenders were attentive and when we told her how surprised we were of the portion size she mentioned that everything is made from scratch also, you can't beat that!

I wouldn't say this was the most amazing food I've ever had, but I also wouldn't say this was the worse bar food I've ever had.  I really like the atmosphere (with or without a dog) the pricing, the service and the menu options.  I'll be back!  *now if they only had a place I could bring my cats....."}
{"text":"Thank you, Paul, for such great customer service and for making sure we had everything we could possibly need. We really appreciated it and so we'll be back to sit in your section."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is our go-to Summerlin restaurant. The venue is beautiful, the patio is great, the food is delicious, and the servers are always attentive. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Came with my husband last night... the shrimp was amazing! loved that we could bring our puppy here. He hates being at home alone... will come back!"}
{"text":"We went last weekend for the first time for lunch and decided to take our 2 dogs. Wow it was fantastic! What an experience to eat lunch with our whole family, it was so much fun! The food is just OK. There wasn't anything that the 4 of us ordered that we loved but I would definitely go back at least with my daughter and our dogs!!! The staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"I had such a great overall experience with Lazy Dog restaurant!  The service and food were phenomenal.  Yes this restaurant is dog themed but it is done in a way that is surprisingly tasteful and not overdone.  You can also bring Fido along and dine out on the patio area if you do.  Luckily my party of two only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Our server was friendly and attentive, she asked us if this was our first time dining there and we said it was.  Our drink and food orders were taken and brought out quite quickly.  The manager even stopped by at our table to introduce himself and bring us out a complimentary garlic flatbread since he heard it was our first time eating at Lazy Dog.  The food and drinks were all delicious, this place is definitely one of the better and more reasonably priced restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  It looked like this place had a decent happy hour too so I'll have to come back and check it out.     

We ordered:
-Spicy Thai Chicken Salad ($9.95) - I had a pretty big lunch so I ordered this thinking it would be light, but the portion size was generous!  I had left overs of this salad, it was delicious and filling.  This menu item did have a flame next to it meaning it would be a bit on the spicy side.  I didn't find it too spicy but I think that's more of a personal preference type of thing. 
-Chicken Pot Pie ($13.75) - My friend ordered this and I had some of the dish.  It was quite tasty one of the better chicken pot pies I've had.  The crust was nice and flaky and the inside had the right amount of chicken to veggie ratio inside too.   
-Coconut Mojito ($8.75) - Super light and refreshing perfect if you want a cocktail but nothing too heavy that'll leave you feeling overly bloated.  
-Southern Lemonade ($7.95) - This drink was delicious a bit on the sweet side, couldn't taste the alcohol in this drink at all (which I guess is a pro or con depending on what type of drinks you like)."}
{"text":"In my personal opinion, this place is freakin' awesome! I come to Vegas once a month and I will definitely be returning to this location. 

The menu on Yelp is so easy to use and order from and you can choose from take out or delivery (which is FREE). Most places charge a fee, or force you to oder a minimum amount, which can be annoying when you don't eat large portions and just want something small. 

Anyway, I was looking for something without Gluten due to intolerance, and this place has an entire GF section, and I love and appreciate them for providing me with that peace of mind. 

What I found was DELICIOUS, yet simple (and super cheap, if that's yo thang). A cup of the Chicken Tortilla Soup and a side of mashed potatoes left me satisfied AF. 

So if you're in Vegas, check this place out, you will not regret it! 

Thanks for reading :)"}
{"text":"Had takeout. Burgers were great, food was ready the minute I got there.
Staff was very friendly. Will be back, but this time plan to eat at the restaurant.

Great place"}
{"text":"The Lazy Dog is a quaint little restaurant with the ambiance of being away in the mountains, surrounded by log cabins. We sat outside around a huge fire pit with an open ceiling. The coolest perk: Dogs are welcomed! Hence the name. The Lazy Dog has a good menu selection for people and a cute little section for the pups. The coffee was spot on, delicious & unlimited. The food, even though simple i.e. fish & chips, turkey sandwich, buffalo wings, were all presented and plated quite elegantly. I highly recommend this restaurant. Sit outside and enjoy the fresh air, surround yourself with a warm fire & good food!"}
{"text":"From our service to the perfection of the food, we will definitely be coming back! It has only been a week since they have opened yet it feels like it's a place that has been here for a while. The chicken and biscuit were done just right with a modern twist. The egg was a great bonus to it. The bison meatloaf was something I'd definitely order again. Ask for Amanda when you come in."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! It is very versatile. Great place for lunch with the kids or girls night out. They have a fantastic drink menu and their food is delish! 

The best appetizer is the spinach dip. The fish and chips are amazing. So fresh! The Tex Mex salad is my favorite though. Great flavor! 

The kids get to make Fruit Loop necklaces while they wait for their food. 

Whenever we receive our bill we can't believe how much we got for our money. 

I also have to mention the amazing staff. So friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The place is super cute. The decor is cozy but cheery. I had a lemon blue berry martini it was really good. The food we had was fresh and excellent. I can't wait to go back here. The bar has many tv's for sports. My husband had a beer flight that came with dog tag labels. It's obvious a lot of thought went into the menu and decor here"}
{"text":"I like the lazy dog! Very good staff. Food always on point. Lots of sitting. Only thing I wanted a booth she said it was for 6 people not for 2. I just wanted to have it a bit more private for a discussion. But owell still like this place."}
{"text":"I'm super sad about this review. The first time I went to Lazy Dog, it was delicious. The service was good and the food was fantastic. We went back this week with friends visiting from out of state and I was embarrassed with the entire experience. The service was terrible! We had to ask for our water to be filled and it was empty most of the time. I shouldn't have to ask for something as simple as having a full glass of water. I ordered the Brussels sprouts for my dinner,(this is what I had last time as well) they were awful. They were cooked too much that they tasted burnt. They were crispy because they were so over cooked. Plus, they didn't put any capers in the dish like they normally do. My friend ordered the starter Mac and cheese and it was the tiniest little dish ever. So not worth $7. Our other friends ordered cheese burgers which were fine but the fries were way over cooked as well. They were hard and old. Spent $77 on dinner and had instant regret. I hate when that happens. I probably won't go back after this visit which is sad because it was good the first time."}
{"text":"Among all the things we ordered, Hash puppies was my favorite! Saviche tostadas was just ok, they could have been more limy. Egg biscuit breakfast sandwich was good.  But unfortunately the Kung Pao chicken was way too dry! But they got a nice  ambience! The lamb pasta was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice/friendly waiter named Brandon. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Went to lazy dog after work to enjoy dinner with my girlfriend and the food was excellent!! We had the campfire pot roast and the fish and chips. Both were fantastic in flavor and can honestly say that the fish and chips were better than Gordon Ramsey!! Definitely coming back and the service was wonderful!! Thanks Mike and Tony!"}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be my last time. We dropped in for lunch and it was worth every penny but not expensive. The food was just great and the service was even better. My only complaint is the place is a bit loud."}
{"text":"I love this place.  And so does my GF & Our Pomeranian.  Great food, Happy Hour & meals for our puppy.  Can't go wrong with this Dog Friendly patio.  Great for the Puppy & great for mom
And dad!"}
{"text":"I was with a group of about 20 ladies for lunch today. We made a last minute switch from where we were going and they were able to accommodate us without having to wait forever and gave us one long table which worked out great. Our waiter, Gerardo was amazing. We asked for separate checks and he said no problem. He was methodical with our orders and everything came out perfectly and didn't take as long as I thought it would have. The food was also excellent. I think everyone liked what they got. A lot of people got burgers which looked fantastic. I ordered Chicken Parmesan which was delicious. They have 2 sizes of this so I ordered the larger size so I could have leftovers for another meal. The portion they gave me was more than enough for 2 meals! I will make it a point to come here again. Oh, and the menu was huge. Prepare to study it, or better yet, look at it online before you go. That way you don't have to take so much time deciding what you want."}
{"text":"New in #lasvegas , great #patio . Dog friendly. Food for everyone , diverse menu . Great atmosphere , good #grub"}
{"text":"I went here on a date before heading to the movies and the service, food and drinks were all on point. We will definitely be stopping in again. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had never even heard of the Lazy Dog until a few days ago, but my family and I decided to go there for brunch this morning. It was honestly so good! The service was friendly, and the outside area was so nice! Having the airplanes fly by every once in awhile disrupted the conversations, but that is not the restaurant's fault. I ordered the creamy eggs and avocado toast with watermelon from the brunch menu and I really could not eat my food fast enough! The avocado toast was sooo good with sea salt and crushed red pepper on top to give it a kick. The bread was toasted but still soft, the eggs were cooked so well with the cheese on top, and the watermelon was so juicy and flavorful and it wasnt just a little wedge, it was a nice thick piece. YUM! 

I highly recommend coming, and don't forget to bring your dogs, too!"}
{"text":"THE BUTTER CAKE!! This is like the most amazing dessert. Trust me, order it. You will thank me!"}
{"text":"The food is just ok, same with the service, but don't bother getting carry out because they will mess up your order. They have gotten our take out order wrong 4 times now, so we won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I wish I would have tried Lazy Dog sooner. The service was quick, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed.

I got the California Burger. The aioli sauce and peppers had a great flavor, it added to the burger without overpowering it. The fries had a clean crisp flavor and were perfectly salted. 

They have a gluten free menu as well and some dairy free options too. The gluten free tortilla soup was amazingly good, the flavors danced!

It was nice to sit outside and be able to see the Vegas strip in the distance. I will be back, next time I'm dining by the fire pit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really cool vibe to it but still has some kinks to work out.  The first timeI came here for happy hour the server forgot to put in my order.  She made it up by comping my meal which was very nice of her.

The second time I came here was during Halloween.  It wasn't too busy at all and there were only a few tables seated out on the patio.  It took a while for a server to even come to the table to get our drink orders in.  I'm a huge fan of Ballast Point so it was nice to see they had the Calico Amber Ale on draft.  They have a great selection on beers.  Our food once again took quite a bit of time to come out.  The fish and chips were so good when they came out.  The batter was so light and the tartar sauce was delicious.

I want to like this place more but the slow service twice in a row is disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is good and they have a good selection of foods. It's pretty big on the inside and they also have a nice patio for outdoor seating w/the high tables and the lower tables. The prices r pretty average compared to other places this is located in downtown summerlin behind the new shopping mall. Oh one more thing u can bring ur dog(s) to eat here they even have food for ur dog(s). Yes they serve food for ur dog(s). Very cool."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my mom, and it was a super nice experience! We sat outside and the weather was very nice plus they have a lot of celling fans.
We ordered the Brussels sprouts and Cajun fries as apps, they were really good! Also the waitress brought us out flat breads on the house since it was our first visit-which was really thoughtful! For dinner we got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with corn succotash, and the chicken pot pie with a side of white rice. Would def recommend. 

Dessert we were set on the salted caramel creme brulé, and it turned out that they were out of it. Sad. But don't worry, their manager comp'd our dessert and told us to pick anyone else. So we got the butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberries and a balsamic reduction. We couldn't have gotten a better dessert. I would honestly just come back for that! 

10/10 would recommend Lazy Dog to anyone shopping in Downtown Summerlin or just anyone looking for a nice meal. Also, have a dog? Feel free to dine outside with your pup, you won't be the only ones!"}
{"text":"I've been here five times and had to complain to the manager three of those times.  If it wasn't for the dog friendly patio, I'd never come back.  The service on the patio is some of the worst service I've ever received.  I think it's because they give the wait staff tables inside as well as on the patio.  Tonight, I ordered my dog's meal as soon as I sat down.  About 10-15 minutes later I ordered my pizza ( which was a first and it was not good).  My pizza came put before my dogs meal!?  Another table that came in and ordered after me got their dog meal at the same time.  Lazy Dog really needs to figure out how to staff the patio appropraiately"}
{"text":"Lazy dogs has a very similar vibe to BJ's. Much more laid back though and of course who doesn't like dogs?!  I really really dig the downtown Summerlin location the other one not so much! The down town Summerlin location always has better chefs. I went Wednesday December the 27th with a reservation for 5pm. Everything was on point and super delicious! Even the customer service was amazing! Our waiter took great care of us even though she didn't introduce herself but that doesn't matter because she was doing a phenomenal job.
I also ordered a ginger ale and whiskey and was surprised to get not that but something better and new lol. They gave me whiskey with a ginger simple syrup, I now have a new drink if the place I'm at is as fancy as lazy dogs and decides to carry ginger simple syrup lol.  Anyways they always have new recipes on their menus as well as seasonal deserts and appetizers or starters. They had a crazy twist on elotes pretty much instead of corn they used hair loom carrots and I loved it.  Also decided to get their version of pad Thai and it was nice to get something like that out of a place like lazy dogs totally unexpected! The shrimp was cooked perfectly again the chef back their was really taking their time everything was super good! I highly recommend this location over the town square one. Town squares location needs to up their game.  It was funny to think because I went to the town square location first I kinda really disliked lazy dogs. Yesterday night I was dragged their by family and I'm kinda glad I was. Because the downtown Summerlin location took my bitterness away. I now love lazy dogs"}
{"text":"Yummy food that are addictive. A great place for a quick bite, but stay for the dessert or drink your meal and just have the dessert. I had a burrito bowl and afterwards the butter cake. Never heard of one, but now have a great appreciation for an imaginative chef. Kudos to the Lazy Dog. Glad you came to town."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat and watch my football games. Food is amazing! Atmosphere is great as well! Best part is you can bring your dog and eat on the patio!  Servers are great too!"}
{"text":"I chose to visit this location based on the positive reviews and the brunch menu being available until 2pm on Saturday and Sunday.  I had heard you could bring your dogs with you here but until I saw it firsthand and was asked by the hostess how many people and how many dogs I wasn't sure I believed it!  How awesome to bring your pooch with you to a restaurant!!  I recommend this place for anyone looking for a dining option in Downtown Summerlin, dogs or not, this place is epic!

Positives
1) Menu is gigantic!  I don't think there is a way that everyone visiting couldn't find something that they would enjoy on the menu!  We had the \"Grizzle Fries\" and \"Chicken Lettuce Wraps\" for appetizers and I recommend both.  I enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich while my wife enjoyed the Black & Bleu burger as main course and both exceeded expectations.  There is also pizza, salads, noodles, along with a variety of meat dishes!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.
2) Brunch menu available until 2pm on Saturday & Sunday.  We didn't have brunch on our most recent visit but look forward to trying the bananas foster French toast, steak & eggs Benedict, breakfast nachos, or breakfast burger!
3) They allow dogs on the outdoor patio and even have a \"dog menu\" with some basic dog rules: https://www.lazydogrestaurants.com/img/content/NUTRITION09252017054106.pdf
4) Service is exceptional, I cannot stress enough how important great service is at a restaurant and this place checks that box emphatically!  Well done.

Negatives 
1) Not the fault of the restaurant but this place is popular and wait times could be extensive during peak periods!  Not sure if the take reservations or are on Open Table, may be worth checking out.
2) Parking is adjacent to the mall and was crowded.  I got lucky and found a spot right up front but saw many people walking quite a distance across the parking lot to enter the restaurant."}
{"text":"My dog and I come here often, it's such a cozy spot and a very dog friendly place. Tonight I ordered Thai salad, the worst Thai salad I ever had- lack of texture and flavor, the chicken was dry, dressing was not Thai whatsoever. Also, the service was slow. Overall the experience was very disappointing. 
It's still a nice spot for me and my dog to spend quality time together, maybe have a drink or two."}
{"text":"So I've been to this location 4 times. The first time I came I was impressed by the variety of food and I loved that it was so noisy that kids are welcomed. The second time I came was with coworkers for lunch. We sat at the bar and I got my sandwich as well as my other coworker a good 10 minutes before my other coworker got her soup. I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't really think it was too big of a deal. It took them awhile to get us the check so we could get out there. I think we were there for a hour and a half and it wasn't because we were wasting time. My 3rd time here, I made reservations for a party of 10. It was ok but my brother's entree took a good 15 minutes to arrive after all 9 of our entrees had arrived. Service was quick in the beginning but lacking at the end. 

Fast forward to my 4th and last visit to this place. We made reservations for 5 pm. It took them 10 minutes to seat us, I'm assuming that they didn't have the tables ready. There were about 4 hostesses up there. After we were seated we had our drink orders taken right away and the appetizers. We then had to wait another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our order which would be fine but I saw that she took a drink order for another table, brought them drinks and took their order. I know we were a big table but you would think that you want to get rid of us first. She came and took our order and it took another 15 minutes to get our entrees. Well one of my brothers didn't get his entree and we didn't see our server for another 10-15 minutes after that. I asked about it and she said she would check. I saw her check the computer as well as her notes. His food came out about 5-10 min later. By that time we were all done eating and when they brought it out it was the wrong thing. They brought out the manager and said that the entree would be comped blah blah blah. My brother said he said he ordered a certain type of chicken but when she repeated it she said another thing  but she changed it to what he said so in his head he was like oh crap. His entree did end up coming out correctly but by then I was just really annoyed. Service has been an issue the past 3 times that I've been here and I'm just over it. It's hard to find anyone to ask questions and I rather spend my money elsewhere even though their food is decent."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great happy hour. Their sangria is yummy as well as all the food I've tried. Love the Ahi tuna salad, their house made potatoes chips and salmon!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Good happy hour and overall great prices. The food was really tasty and tImely. We had an awesome server, Timijen! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas on a whim with my dog thought this place looked great so stopped in cool atmosphere, however trying to order a beer was like pulling teeth. Server: our taps are having issues but bottles are good. 
Me: ok I'll have a kona bottle
Five min later
Server: ohh sorry wer out
Me: darn ok I'll have the stout 
Five min later again 
Server: you know what wer out of that too we pretty much don't have any beer! 
Me: well damn I guess I'll have a root beer do you have that?
Yup
So a bar with no beer and I had the pulled pork sandwich which I found to be disappointing as well but my family enjoyed what they got. 
Still haven't gotten my beer..."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty okay! I love the atmosphere and the fact that you can bring your pups. The staff are always nice and attentive"}
{"text":"The experience is hit and miss. The only thing really consistent is the horrible hostess that, in two consecutive visits was not at her post and looked disheveled when she arrived. The waiters and waitresses are always on point but the food is never consistent. I go because I like the idea of bringing your dog but the food could really use some quality control."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Every time I have family/friends visiting I make sure to introduce them to Lazy Dog. Have never had a bad experience or anything other than perfection. Food, service, atmosphere, and puppies. What more can you ask for? Ask for Erika! Then have her introduce you to Brooke, the assistant manager. They are the best team I've ever been helped by. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that Ronnie is absolutely a delight!  She was my server and her attitude was exceptional.  He food is okay and the drinks are good.  But the experience was phenomenal!  I typically expect this kind of service from an upscale restaurant but his was impressive.  Thank you Ronnie for treating me great and making me feel part of the Lazy Dog family"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Lazy Dogs after hearing how great it was.  The service was terrible, I had to chase the server down for everything including the check.  Crispy Brussels sprouts were unbelievably terrible....over saturated in lemon and I love lemon.  Maui tacos had no flavor, chicken wings were very pedestrian.  Tortilla soup was saturated with cheese it tasted like chicken broth with cheese.  I'm thinking they were having an off night and I should try them again, but first impression was not good.  Btw...we ate as much of our meal as possible, we were starving, but had we wanted to address this with our server, she never came back to the table."}
{"text":"This place is just getting worse, I went in with a group of coworkers and it took over 40 minuets for our food to come out and one of the orders was wrong so they had to take it back. It's so frustrating that they don't do anything about it, such a waste of time and the food is not that great."}
{"text":"Came here because a friend recommended it but I've got to say I was not impressed. Cajun fries were over seasoned. Fettuccini had a weird flavor. Pot roast wasn't bad. Inside out quesadilla was pretty good."}
{"text":"LAZY DOG DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PETS. 
They put onions in my friends dog dish and placed it on the patio floor. 
I did not order food for my dog. Only a water bowl. 

Onions contain an ingredient called thiosulphate which is toxic to cats and dogs. The ingestion of onions causes a condition called hemolytic anemia, which is characterized by damage to the red blood cells. Onion toxicity can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet's body to burst.

Symptoms of this condition include breathlessness, lethargy, diarrhea and vomiting. 

Lazy dog did not research what can harm and possibly kill dogs before deciding to serve them - their management, kitchen and servers were NOT trained. 

Catching up with my friend over dinner - I look down and discover my dog is not drinking his water from his water bowl but instead in my friends dog food bowl which was pushed over to my side of the table by her dog. I keep my dog on a half length leash so he can't wander all over. 

I initially freak out - then rationalize and think \"well ok lazy dog wouldn't put anything in the dog bowl that could hurt them. It is a dog friendly restaurant\" 
I stated I do not feed my dog human food. 
This does not mean \"I was cool with it\" or didn't do anything to stop it.\" 

Lazy dog has chosen to misinterpret my words into saying \"I was cool with it and gave him permission to eat the food\" I never verbally said I was ok with him eating the food. It simply meant I wasn't going to let it ruin my dinner and become angry. I explicitly did not willingly allow my dog to eat out of the bowl with my knowledge. In fact my friends dog was growling at my dog for even being near his bowl. 

My dog reacted severely shortly after and rushed him to the dog hospital. He couldn't breathe and was struggling to vomit. I notified a small piece of clear onion in his vomit. As a result of onion toxicity reaction - he aspirated when trying to vomit. This means vomit got in his lungs and would cause pneumonia. He was in the emergency room for 24 hours on IV antibiotics. 

The female manager was rude and did not care when I asked what they put in the dog food bowl. She showed zero empathy when I stated my dog couldn't breathe as I was rushing him to the er. I needed what ingredients were in the bowl to report to my vet ASAP upon arrival. Per their manager \"we will feed your dogs whatever\" 

Lazy dog did not show any empathy or concern over my dogs health. They did not call the next day to see if he made if through the night. 

Lazy dog then sends us to their claims adjuster from Argo group. 
To proceed with the process he states a recorded interview must take place. 

Their claims adjuster interpreted my words as \"I was cool with it! I have your recorded interview!\" Raised his voice with me, and stated I acted negligently and he would of done anything to protect his dogs implying I am a bad dog owner. 

I expressed my concerns to the claims adjuster the fact that their grills, prepping, and other cooking surfaces could be cross contaminated with several food items harmful to dogs given there was no knowledge or training. 

I asked \"how do consumers know the burgers for dogs are not grilled on the same surface as onions or garlic. How do consumers know there is not onion powder in the burgers you serve to dogs\" 

I expressed I wrote in to lazy dog corporate office one more time as I was disappointed to say the least and their claims adjuster exclaimed \"you will not be hearing from them! I am speaking on their behalf!\" I stated I didn't think I was asking for much to speak with them. 

Lazy dog chose to hide behind their claims adjuster who raised his voice at me, misinterpreted my interview, put words in my mouth, and acted aggressively in our conversations when I tried to make sure other dogs would not be harmed in the future. 

Joel acknowledged the staff was not trained. 

I secret shopped their location in summerlin 2 months after the fact and the waiters still were not trained as to what is toxic for dogs when I inquired. 

This incident took place in april. I secret shopped in may. It is now end of June. I have been biting my tongue patiently before writing this post to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. 

I have given lazy dog every opportunity to act with integrity and do the right thing. 

Technical legalities aside - I am NOT looking to sue for emotional distress or bank any extra cash. I am looking for my full vet bills to be compensated and a simple apology. Lazy dog is not capable of this. 

Lazy dog offered $1000 which does not cover all my vet bills in exchange for signing a contract to silence me and not allow me to speak about this incident with anyone. 

They covered my friends vet bills in full who ordered the dog food. 

I am not biting my tongue anymore. 

Anything you have to say to continue to point the finger at me lazy dog only makes you look worse."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night found an open table in the bar area so we didn't have to wait. I had wanted a blue moon, which they were out of. I ordered the sun-dried tomato Pesto pasta and my husband ordered the chicken pot pie. My dish was good, in fact my husband took it over because his had zero flavor and we returned it. Overall it was mediocre food and service. Too many great restaurants to ever go back."}
{"text":"Went last night and had a great time.  Service was over the top and servers were very helpful & friendly.  I had fish and chips and it was great (Fries could be better).  Wife had Chicken Club which she liked.  Good beer selection.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love lazy dogs and the food! Its kid and dog friendly!  I always ask for my favorite server Jimmy when I see he's working! He is always so patient with our family and hes very accommodating to us! Cant say enough food things about him! He's awesome!"}
{"text":"We went to Lazy Dog for the first time last night.  We had the pleasure of meeting Yanique and having her as our server.  She answered our many questions regarding the menu.. The portions are generous.. the ambience devine.. We thoroughly enjoyed our food.. AND we found out that dogs are not only welcome here but they can also dine as well.  We will definitely be back!! Glad we found you!!"}
{"text":"Came back for a return visit after our 1st experience was very pleasurable. Our first time the place was packed and the food was very good. Tonight the place was almost empty, guess the newness wore off. Also the food was nowhere near as good and the service was just adequate. Not sure if we will make a return visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a large group (12ppl) just this past Sunday... Loved it! The drinks were great and the food was delicious; also the prices are very reasonable. Our server was very friendly and accommodating, he even had no problem splitting the check for everybody (6 pairs of couples)! We asked about their happy hour (we had a late reservation, 9pm dinner) and the manager let us order from the menu even though we weren't sitting in the bar area which was so great, we ordered a few extra appetizers since we got the happy hour prices :)

They also allow dogs on their patio area, my husband and I can't wait to take our pooch for lunch one day! So Cute."}
{"text":"Crappy, inattentive service ruined the entire experience.  Had to ask for a server more than once. I HATE that!  Food basic casual dining food."}
{"text":"Happy Hour time can get supper busy! The food is just OK. 
So it was my first time, took my puppy pug, it was happy hour so it was pretty busy and understaffed. Don't blame staff, I understand they get busy. They just they didn't offer any water for my dog, they forgot to bring three things I ordered, and didn't refill our drinks. Try to get a hold of our server, they were all everywhere and didn't have time to stop by our table. Got charged for the missing food, however they were able to take it off, they apologized and didn't charge us for one item."}
{"text":"First and foremost every single worker we encountered here was fantastic polite and kind. Thank you. The food was okay. I had the Cobb salad and my wife had the Thai chicken. Kids had the pepperoni pizzas. The salads were decent and filling. Big size. The kid pizzas were not the best. None of them cared for the dough.   We did have the Cajun fries for starters and I would not recommend those. Not a whole lot of flavor and kind of bland. But great staff."}
{"text":"Great place to chill after a long days work or just on summer vacay. Nice staff and great food. I highly recommend the Thai Noodles with spice and the Wild Blueberry Lemon Drop martini."}
{"text":"Dog: WOOF WOOF!
Me: Yeah buddy! Let's go out and grab a few bites! How about that!
Dog: Yeah i'm down!
Me: What did you say?
Dog: :x

There is a restaurant where you can enjoy a few drinks and bites while your k9 companion can enjoy some food too! Talk about a cute place to hangout after the dog park with your friends.

Setting: It is in townsquare right by Las Vegas BLVD near the Flemings and Bonefish. The place is hugeeee and the patio area for the dogs is well spaced out. Right when you walk in, it smells like a new home had been built since it's only been open for.... 10 days but as long as it doesn't smell like dog i'll come back.

Drinks: Pretty standard choices for drinks and a happy hour! We went on Wednesday and HH was 9pm-Close. Some bites from $4 to $8. Bud light/coors light $3 for a 16oz and $1 drafts. 

Food: We got the poke jar which made my hawaiian native friend spin. It was a jar with sour cream, guacamole, bits of tuna on the top so a little texmex/hawaiian fusion going on. It actually wasn't that bad! Check in on yelp for free cajun fries that are served in a huge bag! The burger was $5 for HH but the patty meat was soooo thin.

Service: The gentleman that served us in the patio was fantastic! I can't remember his name but he was much better than the first server we started out with. He accommodated the friends that came in two by two and split the bill with no trouble. He was thin, tall and had some hair on his face. 

Overall: A cool spot for dog lovers and friends to come hangout. I can't say their happy hour beats brios but it was okay."}
{"text":"Always get good food and service there. They are also very generous with their freebies via email. Normally I would never order pot roast in a restaurant but their pot roast beef sandwich with au jus caught my eye the other night on take out. I gave it a shot. Awesome sandwich on banquette with mozzarella, onions and horseradish sauce. Very flavorful, tender, shredded pot roast. Dip it in the au jus and you are off to the races. Fries are great too."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Went for my first time and I had a wedge salad and the corn chowder. Yummmmm!  The corn chowder was perfection. The salad was fresh and the ranch was on point. My mom had the pot pie. That was also extremely good. I can't wait to go back and try some more items. There was an apple crumble dessert I wanted to try so bad l, so that's definitely happening next time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with a website say yes for \"reservation\" but when I call they said No!!! 
Unprofessional!!!!"}
{"text":"I met a few out-of-town friends, with their young children, for dinner.  I suggested this restaurant for two reasons:  (1) I love the variety of the menu and I knew the kids could find something they liked, along with the adults, and (2) they were staying at the Red Rock Hotel & Casino and this restaurant is walking distance to that hotel.  

I have to say the menu did not disappoint!  They have a special seasonal/local menu and it was fantastic!  The street carrots were a huge hit with our table.  We also had the chicken pot pie, kids make-your-own pizzas, fish tacos, and the Cobb salad.  Everything was tasty!  And the service was good.  Great menu suggestions & very efficient!

Parking is readily available and free!  It's adjacent to Downtown Summerlin Shopping Center, so the perfect place for lunch when you are there for a day of shopping, too!"}
{"text":"The perfect place to dine with your pooch. The restaurant has covered outdoor seating to dine with your pet. Pets are not allowed to dine inside. If you ask the waiter they will bring out a water dish for your pet.

The menu and drink menu is a decent size. I had the mimosa to start which came with an entire mini bottle of champagne.

For our meal we split several small plates. Our favorite was the hummus trio."}
{"text":"Never been to a dog friendly restaurant before so this is somewhat of a new experience for me. 

When we first arrived there were 3 people ahead of us, so it took about maybe a 15 min wait to be seated which wasn't that bad considering it was a Sunday afternoon. Once seated we were placed all the way in the back behind a pillar which is fine I guess, but considering that there were a couple chairs in front I don't know why we were seated so far. Ok, fine whatever. Once seated, no one came to greet us, it took literally 30 mins for our server to come greet us then take our order. Even with that, we've been sitting there without any utensils and no water for quite a while. I was ok to wait since we had my dog with us and well it was an outing occasion for him since it was his birthday. 

Once we got our food, we had already been there for an hour. The food was mediocre, the only thing that had taste was the Cajun fries even then it was tiresome to eat cause the flavors out did itself. I got the Tex-Mex salad which had a recommendation paw next to it, I thought it was ok. Nothing special to it, and my bf got the lunch special wok chicken which he said was all right. The rice was undercooked, and the flavor was just not there.  I ordered a hamburger patty and brown rice for the little one, and he agreed the rice was undercooked cause even he didn't eat it all, and this boy loves rice lol.

Overall the doggie sitting outside experience was ok, my little one enjoyed being near us. But the food and service was terrible, I'm sad to say I would not be going back again. Which is sad cause this was the only dog outdoor dining experience we've had."}
{"text":"The pot roast dip was amazing, the service was excellent and the wait staff was courteous and checked in with us twice during our dinner. The only down side is the restaurant was packed and kind of loud but that also created a good atmosphere. My parents compared the restaurant atmosphere to T.G.I. Friday's off Maryland parkway in the 70s-80s and described it as \"the place to be\""}
{"text":"Stellar!!!!  That about sums it up.  Food was fantastic but better then the food was the amazing service we received from our waitress Jennifer Ross-Banks.  She wore a smile the entire time, was attentive but not pushy.  When she told us they were out of tater tots and had to substitute, we were fine and understood.  Within minutes the manager came by to apologize and brought us an order of fries instead.  We didn't eat them that quickly and here comes Jennifer offering to bring a a fresh warm order of fries.  One of the most pleasant dining experience my wife and I have had in recent memory.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog was a the greatest experience! Our server Denise, was very attentive and super friendly. She made sure our water glasses were full and that everything tasted great! My boyfriend and I sat on the patio with our maltipoo Poppy, he had the chicken and white rice. He's a picky dog, so I was surprised to see he ate all the rice with the chicken. We enjoyed their chicken pot pie, pulled pork burger, and tried the beer flight. I loved how the chicken pot pie was a traditional set up, and not just a bowl of soup with a piece of puff pastry on top. Downtown summerlin is a perfect location for this restaurant. I will be coming back with poppy for happy hour! Thanks Denise!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet???? I really like bringing my pup here. More restaurants should have pet accommodations, after all they're our fur babies :)
I usually feel guilty when I leave my sweet phatty at home on my days off. He really likes being out and about and Lazy Dog grants me the ability to enjoy myself without neglecting him.
Food and drinks are pretty good. I enjoy their martinis and wine flight. Great bloody mary's for brunch too.
Food wise, sticky ribs with slaw are awesome - meaty with good flavor. I really enjoyed the ahi burger and like their twist on the calamari app. The calamari is stir fried in plum sauce and comes on a bed of rice. Really yummy!
The service has been great every time. Accommodating and personable staff. I take patio seating since that is the only area where pups are allowed. My favorite part of the bring your dog to eat concept is that your pup will eat too! They will serve your fur baby water and you can buy them a protein and rice bowl. You have a choice of white or brown rice and either chicken or beef patty. My phatty loves the patty (hehe).
What I have yet to try is their desert. I used to hit up Gelato Messina after Lazy Dog but since they are no longer in DT Summerlin, I will have to dabble in the desert menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came here to eat dinner with my friend after shopping at town square and was so happy we came here. We ordered the sampler sangria and the watermelon margarita for our drinks. The sampler was so cute and two of the drinks was really good. My favorite was the white peach and the raspberry one. The pomegranate one was a bit strong so didn't really care for that drink. The watermelon margarita was good! Love how they weren't cheap about putting the amount of alcohol in it. It was just right. Monica was our server I believe and she was amazing. She was friendly and came to check on us and everything was great with her. For food we ordered the rib eye medium well and the fish tacos. Everything was delicious. We were so full and happy at the end. I also ordered the chicken breast meal for my dog to go. He loved it! It was only $5 and it had plenty of chicken with rice, peas, and carrots! Definitely loved this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are dark complexion I would not recommend this place. 
They will sit you in the back next to the restroom even though there are plenty seats in the opening. 
Also instead of educating us on the recommended menu items the waitress told us that there was a dog section outside for dogs to eat even though we had no dogs with our party as if she was referring to us.
Weird experience"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog looked very cozy with great decor and a large selection of beers on tap. I had soup and grilled cheese. Nothing extravagant, it was ok. The service is what led me to make this review. We had at least 5 different servers and it was all very slow. Worst service I've encountered in some time. With all the people running around I would have expected a lot more attention."}
{"text":"The best I've had, again and again!

The first time we attempted to come here, there was a 2 hour wait!! Must be good then, so this Sunday afternoon when we were in the area we tried again around 2:30 when there was no wait. We started with the spinach and sundried tomato cheese dip and DANG I knew right away why the wait was so long last time! The best spinach I've had! I wish it was a bigger dish, but so yummy. 

For the main course I had the French dip sandwich and DANG! The best French dip I've had! The beef was clearly slow roasted and was so full of flavor. It was slightly sweet which made it extra delicious. 

My daughter had Mac n cheese which I wish they made from scratch, but it was Kraft...dislike. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"From our host kit with his amazing bow tie to our server Joshua we had an amazing and unforgettable experience I'm so glad Kevin took me here on his day off. I really enjoy watching everyone working together like when there was a spill or when a glass broke, they made sure nobody was hurt. Not to mention the food and dessert was delicious.  I also like that they do the little things like make sure we were enjoying our day Julian stood out on that one. I would definitely come back and I recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Service B+
Food: A-

Host/Hostess: B
Server: A
Kitchen speed: A

Food was good.  Burgers were definitely worth a repeat.  Edamame was excellent. Everything had a nice kick in spice.  Chicken Parmesan was great.  Cooked well, very juicy.

Bonus: Manager did visit the table to check on us.  Sign of a good establishment.

Bottom line:  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Got their food delivered and it was super fast.

Had the buffalo meat loaf.  It was pretty tasty but just a tad dry.  The mash potatoes were average.  The side of spinach was the best I've ever had.  Don't know what they added to it, it looked like just regular spinach, but it was really good."}
{"text":"Went to Lazy dogs for my bday lunch and sat at the bar and Tony the bartender made sure I had an amazing bday lunch Thank you Tony the drinks were amazing and the food was awesome ."}
{"text":"Located in Town Square. Imagine Twin Peaks with out the scantly clad servers. I know, I know, now turn that frown upside down! This is a dog friendly place, as the name suggests. The food is very good, and the service excellent. Sign up for their email club and get all kinds of offers. At very least stop by and check out all puppies, it will do your cynical heart good. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin. Let me start with this, I have to dig any place that, as the name suggests is dog friendly. The food is typical bar food, and that's not a bad thing at all. Be sure to join the meal club for a free appetizer or dessert. The service is ok, but they are new, i am sure they will get it right. A great place to stop in if you need to take a break from shopping. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"We came in with a large group of about 30 people and had really great service. 

For as large of a group that we were, the service was awesome! Everyone had everything they needed in a timely manner. Our servers were very attentive and friendly.

I'm sure any large group can be a bit of a pain but thankfully we all had a great time, ate great food and had exceptional service. Especially since everybody wanted to separated our bills out as well. 

Thank you to our servers, the manager I spoke to and all the other team members that came by our table dropping off food, only to be asked for more stuff! Lol They were all very nice and helpful. You guys are awesome!!

I highly suggest this restaurant out for everybody!"}
{"text":"Came in for the late night happy hour at the bar. I like this casual American looking restaurant. Smart to make it a  super dog friendly place.

Had the super crispy brussel sprouts with caper aioli. The turkey meatballs is mild and easy to eat. The poke jar is made with grade A ahi, so no stringy stuff. The cucumber namasu and guacamole is mild and it supports the fish. The corn charred enough and comes with a luscious mayo sauce.

I miss my dog!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Reagan helped us and made great suggestions on the menu! Fast service and good food!"}
{"text":"Check out happy hour! On week days it's the normal 3-6 (but check before you go) and some nights it's 9-midnight. 

We have been here three times and all meals were delicious. Breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Ahi tartare in a jar, parmesan crisps, and the beer sampler. We did the pork shank and strawberry salad for dinner. We've also tried the Asian salad and bison burger. Best of all worlds. 

This place is super dog friendly. If you're there for breakfast expect fur friends on the patio which has fire pits!!!"}
{"text":"- Our food was very bland and dry
- We had to find our own waiter to order
- wait time was one hour
- dog at next table bit the waiter's foot twice which made me feel unsafe to have my dog
- chaotic patio 
- low standards of service"}
{"text":"Great for brunching the portions are very large I need a to go box. I tried the fried rice which had a nice twist of sausage and bacon in it. The egg comes scrambled on top not mixed in and had to be two or three eggs. Awesome drink specials for brunch with three types of sangria for $5 the rose or white were good with real fruit. Plenty of parking right next to it so you dont have to search for spots. Servers are tentative and checked on us throughout or dining experience. Dog friendly if you want to bring your four legged friends."}
{"text":"Looked so forward to trying this place out until we sat for 15+ minutes without anybody even saying hello and it was not busy at all!  Told hostess and we got an, \"Uh-Ok,\" and still never saw anyone.  Finally had to just walk out. :("}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Lazy Dog in Summerlin, but never made it out that way to give it a try. When I heard this location opened near work I was excited. 

The location is large and easy to access. It's situated between Fleming's and Texas de Brazil in the Town Square shopping center. There is plenty of parking in front of and near the restaurant.

The service was great the night our group ate here. Even with about a dozen diners the service was attentive and quick. Drink orders were taken as each of us arrived and water glasses were constantly refilled. Our salads came out quickly and meals followed soon after.

I started with a Wedge Salad which was delicious. The portion was generous as well. There was plenty of bacon, blue cheese crumbles, onion, and tomatoes. For my entrée I had the Chicken Pot Pie. The chicken pot pie was loaded with chicken and veggies. The pastry crust that covered the dish was flaky and buttery. I really enjoyed this dish and found that it was enough for two meals for me."}
{"text":"Well the pros good selection of beers.

The blistered green beans were good.  The Ahi Salad had a nice sesame crust and it was cooked well. There were a couple pieces of tough tissue that made them hard to eat.  The dipping sauce had a nice spice to it.

The bacon candy was too spicy.  I will try it again and try a sandwich or burger I think.  The small plates are tempting too."}
{"text":"Not good service. I felt like they just didn't like us there. The waiter paid no attention to us and they stuck us in the corner. The food was just ok nothing great. The only good thing about this spot is you can take your pups."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night about 5:00. We sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly bartender who asked for our drink order. We both love dark beer so she let us have a few samples. I ordered the Kung Pao tofu & my husband had the ahi burger. We also shared the veggies & hummus. They accidentally made me chicken, but quickly fixed it & brought out the tofu. Everything was delicious. There was a coconut stout on the menu we wanted to try but the bartender said they didn't have it yet, so maybe next time. Overall a great atmosphere, lots of drink options, and good food. We will return."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Lazy Dog restaurant and bar more stars. I absolutely love this place and can't get enough of the food. We have sat inside and out on the patio and I have to say, the patio is my favorite. I am so glad the company has broadened outside of California and have made Downtown Summerlin their location in Las Vegas. We love to eat and then go shopping. I recommend the trio hummus and the chicken lettuce wraps and then the butter cake for dessert. I have brought my dogs a couple of times too. We always have a great time!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a quick happy hour with friends. Was pleasantly surprised with the location. Thank god it's not in the middle of downtown Summerlin. It's kinda off on its own with plenty of parking and easy in, easy out street access. 

Place was bumping at 5 pm with the happy hour crowd. We opted for a seat on the patio, with the dogs. WARNING: if you hate the sound of little dogs barking, opt for a seat inside. I love that they offer doggie meals and doggie seating, but I hate little yappy dogs, and there were plenty of them!

Our waitress was incredible. She gave us so much attentiveness, it honestly felt like we were her only table. She was so friendly and cordial...I just wish I could remember her name here!

Food was just OK. We ordered:

- White peach sangria
Amazing! Can come in a pitcher.

- Togarashi Edamame Beans
This was awesome. It comes in a tangy spicy sauce. So good!

- Hand-breaded Chicken Tenders
These were gigantic, but nothing out of the ordinary.

- Cajun Fries
Had a nice seasoning on them. Pretty good, but nothing outrageous. I would've liked them to have been crispier. They weren't soggy, but they weren't crispy. Dip for the fries is super yummy!

- Ahi tuna sliders
Really could've been better. I couldn't even taste the ahi because it was heavily coated in some kind of avocado sauce. 

- Brick Oven Spinach & Sundried Tomato Cheese Dip
Meh. Didn't care for this. The spinach dip had a really tough and overly gooey consistency. 

- Spicy Buffalo Chicken Nuggets
Just OK. Again, nothing crazy. 


To summarize: the service was incredible. The drinks were fantastic. And the food was just so so. For everything we ordered, our bill was only $74!!!!! Outrageous price for the value."}
{"text":"Some things look better on paper.

We take our dogs everywhere we possibly can but even as a dog lover, I was a bit grossed out that nearly every table on their patio had one or two dogs.   Our guys left a mess under the table with water and food bits, I can only imagine the dirtiness from all of the pets by the end of the day.

Our server, I do not know his name, was super attentive and friendly.  Kudos on that.  Our food came out relatively fast too, so that was good.  

We had high hopes for the menu but we were really letdown.  It's like elevated bar food.  The best looking thing we ordered was the hamburger meat for our dog.  The fries were completely overspiced.  The ahi poke jar was....just okay...but looked better on the menu.  My husband's chicken dish was unremarkable.  I can't believe I was charged $3.95 for a 'salad' that consisted of a plate of lettuce with some canned red peppers.  My fish and chips was actually pretty good.

We discussed if we would return and we would not.  The food is simply underwhelming and unremarkable."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday for lunch around 12, from start to finish everything was very good.

When we walked in the hostess was quick to greet us with a smile and directed us to the bar as we requested.

Once sitting at the bar Roy and Brandon were prompt to greet us and get drinks started. From start to finish their service was awesome! They held good conversations with us making it a 1 of a kind experience.

Food: we ordered the lettuce wraps to start which were tasty and lite so we were not too full for our lunch.
The cheese and basil pizza perfect size to split and had great flavor.

Drinks: originally I ordered the Michelada, which was ok, the flavors just weren't hitting me right I guess. They happily swapped me out for the coconut mojito which was amazing! It's light and refreshing!

Throughout our lunch there were multiple managers that came and checked on us which was really nice! Jason and Jake both were very friendly and professional. 


Overall really great experience, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Well, my son and I had some extra time so we went to Lazy Dog. Great concept because I am a dog lover. It took our server about 20 minutes to get to us for the first greet. The it took another 10 minutes to  get our water and chocolate milk. Our food order came out almost immediately after that (a cobb salad and children s noodles with apple slices and carrots) however, I had no silverware to eat with and the only thing my son got was apple slices. I told the runner we need the noodles and carrots. She brought back the noodles, I said still need the carrots. She explained to me only 1 thing comes with the noodles and you got your apple slices. I stated, i had also ordered carrots. She got into a small debate because she stated they are extra and I told her I KNOW and I ORDERED THEM! So 4 minutes later his carrot slices arrived from the waitress. Keep in mind i still have no silver ware. I asked her to bring some and she did.  On to the meal. The cobb salad right off the bat seemed a little off. I ate half of it. It took quite a while to get bill, we paid and left. My stomach was very yucky for the better part of a day and a half. Not good."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio where the responsive wait staff provides great service. They'll even bring Fido a bowl of water. Food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to relax and enjoy dinner and drinks. My husband and I have brought many of our visitors to dine at lazy dogs. The atmosphere and service is spectacular. The food is tasty. I'm looking forward to next weeks visit to Lazy Dogs."}
{"text":"The lack of starness can be attributed mostly to the atmosphere on this particular Friday night.  We were seated in the two person booths off the bar next to a very loud party.  (Annoying, but not the restaurant's fault).  Even worse, my seat shared a wall with the swinging door that led to the patio.  Every five seconds this door slammed, shaking my very seat like a 7.3 earthquake.  
The online menu we accessed included a buffalo chicken sandwich but I guess this locale has reduced their menu....no buffalo chicken.  Instead, I had a tasty pulled pork sandwich with onion strings on the side, coleslaw on top ($10.95).  Also a 105ish calorie coconut mojito ($8.50) that was refreshing.  Service was speedy and polite.  We waited the longest (10-15 minutes) for our to go dessert.  All in all...good menu and drink selections but beware the noise level inside on busy nights."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog in my opinion is totally underrated. Next to Brio, this is another favorite Happy Hour gem in Town Square! 

It's pretty cool that you can bring your dog here. There's an outside patio where you can be seated with your dog. I came with a friend once and he ordered a grilled chicken and white rice platter for his pup! 

Why I REALLY enjoy Lazy Dog is for their Happy Hour: 
- Mon - Fri, 3P - 6P and Sun - Thurs, 9P - Close
- A large selection of tasty apps ranging only from $3 - $8
- Drink specials from $3 - $6 (beer, wells, sangria, wine, martinis, etc) and a beer/shot combo for $4

My app recommendations: 

- Togarashi Edamame 
I order this every time I'm at Lazy Dog and to be completely honest every order has tasted different. The taste definitely isn't consistent but I don't mind because it always tastes good! I would best describe it as edamame wok fried/tossed in a special spicy sauce (maybe different chefs?)

- The Dirty Dog 
Portion is for one person - it's about a half of a Nathan's hot dog wrapped in bacon and served on a Hawaiian bun. The hot dog is topped with slaw, chips, and drizzled with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce! Super messy but also super delicious 

- Buffalo Chicken Lollipops
Small 4 piece naked tenders baked in spicy buffalo tossed served on a bed of coleslaw. Tastes great! Very small serving size though

I've also tried the below apps:

- Chicken Wings
Around 8 or so traditional wings tossed in a sweet/tangy buffalo sauce - served with a few pieces of celery and carrots with bleu cheese for dipping. Not your typical buffalo sauce yet still enjoyable 

- Chicken Lettuce Wraps
Tastes like average chicken lettuce wrap. Stir fried diced chicken and veggies served with lettuce, a tangy peanutty teriyaki sauce, and a side of cucumber salad 

- Atomic Fried Rice
Similar to the edamame - the taste is never consistent. The only difference in comparison is that out of my two times trying, the first time it actually tasted good and the second was completely bland. Large portion of rice stir fried with diced kimchi and topped with a fried egg and seaweed seasoning. Not exactly authentic tasting but it really didn't taste bad the first time!

- Wok-Fried Calamari
Not your typical calamari - basically large pieces of squid are battered and doused in a sweet and sour sauce and served on a bed of rice. Literally like orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken except it's squid, not chicken. Pleasantly surprised by the taste!

- Waffle Cut Parmesan Chips
Fresh, crunchy, house made chips. Simple yet tasty choice to snack on 

- Grilled Garlic Flatbread
Bread baked with garlic seasoning and cheese served with a side of marinara. Pretty decent app 

My friends really like the beer/shot combo since draft beer plus a shot of your choice of Jameson, Jack, or Milagros for $4 is a total steal. I personally like the beer here - there's a few Lazy Dog original beers on draft.

Don't forget to check in for a complimentary order of Cajun fries! It comes with a chipotle ranch aioli for dipping and the portion is the perfect size to share with a group. 
 
I've tried a few of their main entrees and wasn't \"wowed\" (besides their Brussel Sprouts which are crispy, charred, and amazing) but I definitely keep coming back for their happy hour specials. Would recommend Lazy Dog for casual drinks and apps during HH!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how amazing the customer service is here. The other night my family and  went here for dinner. The manager (I'm guessing) was so polite. He made us feel welcomed like and comfortable. Te little gesture of helping my brother take his jacket off was very impressive. He continuously walked around and made sure everyone, not only our table, was having a great experience. He even offered to turn off the fire place because we had long sleeves and what not on. The food is good. We had the chicken nachos, wings and tuna poke to start all were very delicious. The nachos are a big portion. we were full off of the appetizers. We ordered the lamb shank with mashed potatoes it was yummy! the lamb was so soft and juicy it literally melted in your mouth. The make your own pizzas on the kids menus take  a little longer so i recommend starting it right before or around the time you start appetizers. I love the fact that any burger can be substituted with a turkey burger. Over all the ambiance is great, the food is delicious, the customer service is always great."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying g this restaurant and the food was alright. The service though was AWESOME!!!!! The place was crowded and we sat there for about 10 minutes as I looked around for a waitress. A waitress sees me looking around while she's carrying a try full of drinks and stops over to ask if anyone had helped us yet. She delivers her drinks and immediately returns to help us. Such a great way to show great customer service!! She ended up being our server for the night until she switched shifts. I wish I had a chance to thank her for being attentive and giving such great service. Her name was MARIA. The next server was SELINA and she was also very good with us! Will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"I really like Lazy Dog. The restaurant is divided into three areas: indoor dining,  indoor bar, and outdoor patio dining. If given the choice, go for the outdoor patio! The patio has awesome fire pits and is dog friendly. Part of the fun of eating here is dog watching! 

The menu is fantastic - I recommend the calamari as an appetizer. It's not your run of the mill calamari, rather it's Asian seasoned and served with rice. They also have fantastic fish tacos and sandwiches for your main course. The best drink on the menu hands down is the coconut mojito. It tastes like a tropical vacation. 

The bathrooms are clean and the wait staff is friendly. 

4 stars because we wanted to order the roasted Chicken + Havarti sandwich but they were out of Havarti cheese so we had to order something else."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently went to the Lazy Dog at Town Square and could not have been more pleased with the experience! The food was absolutely incredible and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. Above all, the service we received was absolutely incredible! Our server Marina was attentive, charming, and very knowledgable. We spent quite a while out on the patio and Marina made sure that we were comfortable and well taken care off. We also had the pleasure of meeting Kristen, the manager. Kristen was very friendly and extremely accommodating! At one point my boyfriend remarked that we were receiving celebrity service, which made me laugh because it was spot on. I had never been to the Lazy Dog before and it is now one of my favorite places to visit!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour(3-6p) and lunch specials (daily before 4pm) service is exceptional. What's best is taking your furbaby with you. But take them if they're calm and not too noisey. Gotta respect other people. This would be my 5th time there so far, they never dissapoint. 
My favorites are the spinach and cheese dip, chicken lettuce wraps, Cajun fries, cheese sticks (grilled cheese) and tomato soup, club sandwiches wedge and ceasar salads. Seriously can't go wrong with anything off the menu."}
{"text":"Trekked all the way to Town Sq. instead of our usual Downtown Summerlin Lazy Dog because we were meeting friends from the east coast who were staying sans car at Tahiti Village.  

This location is barely a month old, but of course is a carbon copy of the other venue, along with the freezing indoor temperature.  That's my main gripe.  But I dressed warmly in anticipation, and I wasn't disappointed.

Our friends ordered the ahi tuna and trout entrees.  The ahi was a beautiful presentation, and my friend thought it was a bigger piece of fish than what she usually is served at other places.  The trout was plain, but that's how she ordered it.  They both enjoyed their dishes.

The hubby and I had a coupon for our anniversary for a starter or dessert, so we ordered the chicken nachos.  It seemed even bigger than usual, and was even spicier than what we customarily get.  No complaints there.  We had also ordered a Thai chicken salad to share.  Normally, the nachos are more than enough for the two of us, but we figured everyone would be digging into the nachos.  Wrong!  Neither of them eats anything spicy (that's the E. Coast for you :).  But we didn't know that before we ordered a Thai Chicken Salad to share, so we ended up with an overabundance of food.

The kitchen took care of splitting the salad for us.  That was the good part.  The bad was that it was weird.  Terrible?  Not totally.  But there were no greens, and it seemed to be just chicken over coleslaw.  Or maybe all that white stuff wasn't cabbage.  There may have been peanuts, but if so, they were so chopped up we couldn't even tell.  We've had Thai chicken salad everywhere, and have never experienced anything like this.  We were extremely disappointed, and would never order this dish again.

Our waiter, Mason, was engaging and cute, even after we determined that yes, he had voted, but for the wrong party.  I can't help myself, I'm obsessed with asking.  And no, we didn't stiff him.

Despite our unfortunate salad, Lazy Dog is a good, solid addition to the expanding restaurant scene at Town Sq.  They just need to turn up the heat.  And I don't mean the jalapeños.  They gave us plenty of those!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog was crowded, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table at around 8:30 p.m., and it's Saturday night.  That's because it's a big place, and offers a variety of seating in the restaurant, bar, and also the patio, where (wo)man's best friend can join you for dinner.  

The only canines with us tonight were in our mouths, and they wanted to do their work.  But first, the drinks.  I was thrilled to see that Lazy Dog hasn't copied every other chain restaurant.  They actually have the drink prices printed on their menus!!!  Having been burned more than a few times, we always ask, and we didn't have to endure the waitress saying \"I THINK the price is...,\" or have a server run back to the bar repeatedly to ask the bartenders.  I deplore this practice, so it was refreshing.  And so was the Peach Bellini I ordered, which was served in a tall, skinny glass with the peach puree , and a fresh individual 187 ml bottle of Freixenet Cava on the side. The draft beer list is extensive, and the prices are reasonable - my Bellini was 7.25, and I could have had a margarita for less, and his draft Tenaya Creek was 4.00 for 16 oz.

My husband ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and I decided on the Chicken with veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  We also ordered a side salad, and our waitress properly asked if we wanted it before or with our meals.  We wanted it before, to share a little nibble before the main event. The one downfall in the service is that it never appeared, but the runner came out with our entrees.  Rather than have the food taken back to get cold, we cancelled the salad.

The hubster loved his pot pie.  I wasn't all that crazy about my pasta dish:  it was bland, the eggplant cubes were undercooked, and it was way too salty.  Though I have no trouble sending back a dish that isn't prepared properly, I was going to just stick with it.  But suddenly, unbidden, a young woman appeared, introduced herself as Lorena, a manager, and asked how my food was.  Not my husband's, just mine.  I told her all about it, but said I was going to keep it, even after she offered to get me something else.  Turns out that she's not a manager at this branch; she's from corporate, and is charged with getting this new restaurant up and running.  It's their first location outside of California, and they want to get it right before their next venture into Texas.  She said that they'd had a number of complaints about my entree, namely all of the things I found wrong with it.  She stated that she was already taking it off the check, and insisted I get another entree, even if I had it boxed up to take home, which she also was going to comp.  How could I resist!!

Act II was the Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich, on the brioche roll instead of the multigrain bread, at Lorena's suggestion.  All the stuff I love:  walnuts, curry mayo, cranberries, and more.  It was delish!!  But more important, that experience was Service, with a capital S.

We both really love Lazy Dog, and their very big menu - plus a nice Happy Hour menu - and with the location pretty close to home, we'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I think I might be one of those awful yelpers who only take the time to post when I am really upset.

Tonight, I absolutely must post about the phenomenal service I recieved from my server, Adam.

I dined alone, as I am new to town.
Despite the place being packed, I felt welcomed immediately.  None of that \"oh you are a party of one\" face to which I have become so accostomed.  Not the standard broken record, \"hello my name is\" but truly welcomed.  

He immediately asked if I would like another drink--the first came from the bar--and gave me his suggestion for the mango jalepeno margarita when I asked for something different.  Excellent suggestion!  And, it paired perfectly with my burger.

The veggie burger was delicious.  The cajun fries were a good upsell.  

The timing came out wonderfully.  Adam checked on me often, but not too often.  He was warm and funny and just a joy."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique! Bring your pooch and enjoy a nice meal in the patio or hangout inside by the bar and get a beer from the fire hydrant beer tap! The menu is diverse and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ate here during brunch on Sunday. I ended uo having a cheeseburger while my daughter had their pasta and chicken nuggets. The burger was delicious and service was quick. I thought the chicken nuggets my daughter had were overcooked. There also seemed to be a lot of staff in training, but I believe that is because this location is newer than the one in Summerlin. Either way, i would highly recommend coming to this restaurant if you want generic american food."}
{"text":"What a great find. Earned verbal greats in all categories. Great food that's an American-Southwest fusion. Great service with a smile. Great atmosphere. Great time. Very impressed.
Had their carne asada which was perfectly flavored. Also sampled the Hawaiian sticky ribs that tasted amazing with umami fries.
Downed with a peach-strawberry bourbon served in a jar and had the best crumble I've had outside the U.K.
A great experience."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times & the food & service never disappoint!  The coconut shrimp curry bowl is a must as well as the bison meatloaf! Everything is so flavorful! We also visited for my daughter's birthday with a party of 10 during dinner rush... they got us seated quickly & took great care of our entire party!  Their hostesses & waitresses are always so nice & provide customer service!"}
{"text":"I usually love the food here and I have ordered food from this restaurant via grubhub the food is fast and good But there was no dressing of any kind inside my cheeseburger it was so dry I was almost choking on it. I wish they would put some on the side at least usually restaurants do that without the customer asking. Sadly I was out of ketchup so I had to down it with some coke."}
{"text":"Veggie burger on point! Service on point! Overall awesome experience every time I've eaten here. Yummy drinks. Blue cheese coleslaw was amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - decently priced! And what dog lover wouldn't love the fact that you can dine with your pooch in the outdoor seating area?! ( doggie menu included ) brought our family party of 7 on a busy Friday night, they were able to accommodate us quickly and the service was prompt. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with how I was treated by the female manager who took my complaint regarding not one, but two messed up orders. My husband and I have loved the food from day one which has kept us coming back. I called management to discuss how the two most recent take out orders delivered by Grubhub were completely messed up and it affected my kids eating their meals. I expected perhaps an apology or at least someone sounding like they cared about my experience. NOPE. The manager only made excuses for the kitchen, and continued by informing me that if I wanted my order correct I should've called the restaurant AFTER placing my online order to check for accuracy. This manager left an extremely nasty taste in my mouth and obviously didn't care about losing  my business. I therefore will take my business elsewhere...we're in Vegas where there are many restaurants from which to choose. Just having good food doesn't justify spending my money at your establishment."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't really understand the whole idea of bringing your dog to a restaurant unless it's a service dog. But at least here, and despite the name, dogs are restricted to the outside seating area. 

Now for the restaurant:

The food is very good and fresh but the menu is less than extraordinary. To me, this is just another run of the mill sandwich and burger joint. But as one of those, it's a good one. 

The service here definitely deserves a 5. I've eaten here a half dozen times and always felt like I could have stayed for hours. The staff is so kind and on top of things you just don't want to leave. 

It's definitely worth your time and money to try this place. Who knows, maybe you'll score them a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Good food with a great atmosphere and fantastic service.  You can sit outside and enjoy Downtown Summerlin!  They have great specialty cocktails.  Bring your favorite puppy to sit outside and enjoy from a choice of hamburger and chicken served with brown rice!  Nice size fire pit to sit and have cocktails with friends.  A must do for Summerlin lovers."}
{"text":"went in for dinner w the fam from out of town.  Our waitress (Ronnie was her name maybe) was a super sweetheart.  So patient w my gram who was soft spoken and undecided (as usual when in Vegas and eating somewhere new lol).  We ordered the Tex Mex salad, The BBQ Bacon Burger (medium well), the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl and gram ended up w a plain salad with tomatoes.
I did the yelp check in for free Cajun fries.  OMG soooo delish.
The manager also brought us out complementary little waffle chips with garlic and parm on them.  They were kinda greasy but still a nice gesture.
Our food arrives and everything looks yummy.  My bowl was just meh and salty.  I made my aunt try it to make sure it wasn't just me and she agreed it was salty.  I love teriyaki bowls but was disappointed and ended up sending it back.  My aunt LOVED her salad and dad was enjoying his burger until he looked down and saw it was more just medium done instead of medium well (there was blood..ick).  He didn't send it back.  We were all just kinda ready to go at that point.  I wouldn't say don't go, but I'd maybe suggest some other things besides what we had...except the salad of course :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  I loved that they had a menu for the pups.  My dog had chicken and brown rice.  She was so happy.  So fun to be able to bring our dog to lunch."}
{"text":"My first time.  Andrea was very nice i tried a beer my friend like it.  I tried another beer it wasa Red ale.  She help us with the food choice she was just perfect.   My food was awesome.   I had a chicken bowl no rice extra broccoli 
Thank you for the great service"}
{"text":"Service makes all the difference. I've been here a couple times and was compelled to finally write a review because we had the best server, Jennifer R. My mamacita is in town and she kept saying through our meal how good of service we were getting 

We split a plain cheese brick oven pizza and a baby green salad. Big portions and fresh ingredients. Salad was an extra $2.95 and we split it -- holy cow the split portions were enormous! I would never have been able to finish a full salad! See my pics. Everything came out very fast. Very cheesy and yummy.  

Reasonably priced and very nice dining environment.  Huge menu with lot of variety and the back page has great healthy meal options. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Appropriately named \"Lazy\" Dog. I have been here more than a couple of times now. The food is consistent, but the service and organization are not. This time the service was just unbelievably flawed. At first we had to continually remind our waiter about our drinks. My brother and sister waited (no joke) 35 minutes for their drink. About an hour after walking into the restaurant we got our appetizer and dad's soup-both wrong. After waiting again they finally got the soup right, appetizer not so much. We didn't bother. So I suppose you should consider the efficiency of this place before stopping by. If you like waiting long periods of time for your food, this is your place."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog's is one of my favorite places... The services is always fsntatisc. The outdoor seating is the best! Actually, I've never sat inside... No matter the time of year, I prefer their outdoor area. 

It's great to see people bring their dogs out with them for a meal. Pricing is good... They have a great happy hour menu. 

I have yet to experience anything negative. It's always an enjoyable time. 

Go check them out!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for dinner last night. We have both always  been very happy with the food and the service. 

I ordered the grilled steak salad and the meat was pretty tough. The flavor of the salad was decent, nothing exceptional. My daughter had the sweet and spicy wok chicken bowl which was good.  We split the banana pudding which was by far the highlight of the meal.

Our server Jimmy's service was VERY marginal at best. He didn't come over once to check if we needed anything or check how our food was, or refill our drinks.  My daughters water glass was empty before he came to refill it. He even brought the check to us and didn't say thank you!  I am always a 20% plus tipper but really struggled with even leaving him 15% as he truly didn't deserve it for the extremely poor service he delivered!

Very disappointing dining experience!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we always get the server in this place who seems to lack attention to detail or customers.  I really like this place but after the last few visits it may be time to find a new hang out spot.

We came in on Fathers Day, all the servers brought a present to their tables except our server, she never brought one over, she never brought a to go box as requested and she rarely came back to check on us.

The lack of attention must be a direct reflection of management not paying attention to what's going on.

It's sad that this place has decent food but the star rating is for the service.  

I can't recommend this place because service is so hit and miss, more miss then hit.  I guess this is a reminder why we have not been here for a while and this will no longer be my first choice.  There are way to many other options in town to choose from that have decent prices and way better service..."}
{"text":"We arrived and asked for a table for 5, we were told it was about a 15 minute wait which was no biggie.  We went to the bar to have a drink and wait for our table.  My mom came who is on a walker and can't stand long and had a seat with us.  The pager went off, I went to the hostess stand and she told us to go outside and someone would be out there to seat us.

We went outside and there was no one outside to meet us.  We stood outside and waited and waited and finally I asked one girl who said she would check on our table and never did.  I went back to the hostess and told her I was getting really upset because my mom is on a walker, can't stand and there is no one outside to seat us.  She did apologized and came outside but sat us at a table for 4 crowded between two other tables, REALLY???

The food is good and so far our server is good.  I will update on that later...

The food was good, Adam our server was Awesome...two managers came by and even though we told the waiter who told the managers, not even a free drink, just the standard free ice cream which I don't eat.  Overall other then Adam this experience, is one that will make me not return here, I'm done.  Leadership starts from the top and customer service seems to be consistently poor at both locations.  It's a shame because the food is pretty good but even with that being said, food coming out of the kitchen is hit & miss.  Yesterday there was a lack of attention and the consistency went down as it got busier."}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious place! My friends were happy we chose this place so they could bring the pup. They even got to order something for her - a burger that came with a scoop of rice!

It was a Sunday, so their brunch menu was available and I chose to order from that. I got the carnitas Hash which featured sweet potato tater tots, home fries, bell peppers, onions and a green sauce. The sauce is definitely where all the flavor was. And it's definitely a potato heavy dish, which makes me happy! This dish was delicious, but I'd be perfectly happy to try something else next time. 

Like maybe the Sticky Ribs? My friend Mr. P let me try a bite of his. The plum BBQ sauce isn't particularly plum-y tasting. But it's sweet on the front and vinegar-y on the back. Very nice!

The service was friendly, but definitely on the slow side. But I know we'll go back despite that!"}
{"text":"Ughhhhhh I am SO on the fence about this place. It has just a shaky combo of both pros and cons. Honestly if they did not have the dog friendly patio I would never come back here, but the ambiance of the patio and the fact that you CAN enjoy a drink with your pup is enough to bring me back. I have been here 4 times and every single time it seems to be the same story...
Pros:
1.Service has always been great especially the waiters and waitresses. My friend had a complaint about her food and the manager came by and it was handled with nothing but professionalism and her meal was comped which was very nice.
2.Drinks are ALWAYS on point. They have some great bartenders here. 
3.Great atmosphere and kept really clean seeing as to how there are dogs everywhere! 

Cons :(
1.the food is SOOOOO mediocre! I have never been wowed by ANYTHING here. It's very much a Applebee's, Chili's type quality. I've had the strawberry french toast, the chicken pot pie, the spinach artichoke dip, the veggie lasagna and the fish and chips and every single dish was just really lacking in taste, quality and freshness. 
2. As awesome as the doggie meals are, I worry how fresh the chicken and meat in them are as even though my dogs have never gotten sick from them, my friends dog within hours became severly ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Makes me worry that maybe the meats they use in the doggie meals are very low quality. We called them after to let them know and they were very apologetic.

So again, great spot to chill with your pup and get a drink but don't expect some out of this world meal. I think with maybe just a bit more effort and quality with the ingredients in the food it would be SO much better."}
{"text":"I recently stopped here with a friend for Sunday brunch with our puppies. I've only ever been to the downtown summerlin location so compared to that this one is much bigger. It's located in the front of town square right near bonefish grill and Fleming's. All dogs are welcome on the patio and they even have a dog menu. 

On this visit we decided to share the DIY mimosas to start which was a fantastic idea. It came with a full bottle of champagne and three homemade juices. My personal favorite was the huckleberry. For a meal I had the chilaquiles, so good! I loved the salsa and that fact that it's vegetarian friendly. My friend had the blackened chicken bowl which she said was amazing as well. To finish it off we enjoyed a free pumpkin cheesecake from an email promo my friend had. It was probably the best dessert I've had in awhile.

I really just love everything about this place. The concept, the food, and the service are all great."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Anywhere with a dog friendly patio and dog menu options is a 5 star in my heart. Also as an added bonus their human food is pretty great too. 

My boyfriend's mom and I came here for a bite to eat with my little man, Logan. The wait was about 30 mins which wasn't bad for a Friday night. We lucked out and the weather on the patio was perfect. The only downside to being on the patio is how crowded it can be once all the dogs are out there. 

For food this time around I had the ahi tuna sandwich. It wasn't the best I ever had, but still tasty. 3/5 I did like the option of a watermelon slice as a side though because I love watermelon. My bf's mom had the nachos which looked awesome and were HUGE! Unfortunately I didn't try any though. To accompany my meal I did have the sangria sample which I thought was excellent. 5/5

I love this place for casual dinners and will definitely need to give brunch a try for next time!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have a place to bring our dog. He is a very well behaved pittie and most places we take him, people are scared of him but the staff here never give us a problem. Tonight we were in Omar's section and he was hustling! So nice to see wait staff working for their money. Tackle enjoyed his usual chicken and brown rice dinner & we enjoyed our Coors Light & appetizers. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I think they named this place after the staff we walked in on a Friday night and there were more staff members and patrons it was freezing in there... We had to go and find someone to ask us to be seated really weird half empty... So in personable and I want to make eye contact as were waiting around with literally 90% empty restaurant on a Friday at 10 PM! Will not be going as Las Vegas local and food he definitely never recommending never going there again"}
{"text":"Not great. Our server, Aaron, was very rude and snarky. The other servers seemed friendly and helpful, however, so I think it was just our server that had poor customer service skills. Anyways, food was underwhelming for the price, but my husband did enjoy the fried chicken dinner, which is why I'm giving 2 stars not one. Anyways, pass on this place. There's better options in the area."}
{"text":"Went here the other day. Service is super slow even tho it wasn't busy. It took what seems quite some time to get out order. Not sure what transpired at the bar in front of us but a couple who had come in sat down and waited about 10 mins before the man blurts our 'F*ck that B*tch' and storms to the front asking for a manager. The food is good, but the service is lack luster and slow. Hopefully they'll get it together. Love this place in California."}
{"text":"Good poblano chicken.  Not as spicy as they said so I added jalapenos.  Great service.  The edamame are the best Ive ever had.  Super noisy in the restaurant so sit outside if its not too hot."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and cozy. It is like your typical American restaurant when it comes to the food like Yard House or Claim Jumpers - but what is unique about Lazy Dog is that you can bring your dog with you!

First time visiting was for a friend's birthday dinner. I got the pasta Carbonara. It was a pretty good portion, however, I thought that it was too salty. My friend, who had ordered the mushroom pizza thought hers was pretty salty, too.

I did like the fact that if you checked in to the restaurant you get a free appetizer, so we got a basket of their really good basket of fries.

The place was packed, considering we did dine in on a Friday evening; however, the service took a very long time. The waitress did not check in on our table enough, and we were a pretty big group. Also, since we could not get a hold of our server, it took an even longer time to get our checks. Overall, we spent a little bit over 2 hours in the restaurant, so the efficiency on a busy evening is very poor."}
{"text":"I walked in and asked to be seated on the patio. When I walked out on to the patio I noticed there were literally dogs out on the patio. Now I get why they call it Lazy Dog. Needless to say, I sat inside.

The food was just average pub food. Margarita Pizza, Fish Tacos, Fish & Chips, and Tofu Stir Fry. No need to go through each item. It was all average and over priced. The homemade ginger beer was good, but too sweet. I had to exchange it for an iced tea.

They have a cool bar with quite a few beers on draft. They also have a happy hour menu and the margaritas look good. I will probably be back to have a drink at the bar, but the food did not impress"}
{"text":"The Lazy dog had a few people having lunch other than ourselves, however it took 15 mins for a waiter to take our drink order. 

I had the fish and chips (lunch plate) which was pretty good. The French fries were perfect and the coleslaw was very refreshing. 

During our meal not once did anyone ask if we needed anything, or how our meal was, I found that weird. The only time our waitress came to the table after serving our food was to take our plates. Maybe they were short staffed, ill give them the benefit of the doubt. But it would have been nice to have the chance to ask for ketchup with my fries"}
{"text":"Went for first time last night and have mixed reviews.  The food was decent and food quality good. The service was questionable. While our waitress was cheerful and helpful I'm not sure if she was to blame or others. 

We ordered drinks shortly after we were seated.  Five minutes later our waitress returned with the soft drinks stating that we would be served shortly. While there she took our food order in which we ordered appetizers and entrees.  Fifteen minutes after that we were descended on by three wait staff with all of our entrees. 

We immediately complained that we had not yet received our appetizers at which our appetizers arrived. We protested again then one of the wait staff remarked \"so you want us to throw away all of this food?\"  

Fortunately a manager passed at this time seeing our confusion and frustration.  And assured us they would re-fire our entrees. We pointed out that we had still not received our drinks. He went to the bar to retrieve our drink order while we began to enjoy our appetizers. Shortly after that we received our initial drink order followed closely behind by a duplicate order served by the manager.  He then took away the duplicate order again apologizing. 

We finally were able to enjoy the appetizers with our drinks. Once finished the fresh entrees did arrive. 

When the check arrived we did verify that we were not charged twice for anything.  We were somewhat surprised though that we were not offered anything for this gaff other than apologies. 

Not sure we'll return."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food, the vibe, and the service, especially Jackie she answers all of my questions nicely and patiently,her recommendations have always been great, she's very nice and always have a smile to share, I would definitely ask for her again."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! Original recipes that have a Hawaiian flare. The green beans rocked!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak salad for 16:00 when I got it I didn't see any steak.so a started digging through it and found about four little pieces."}
{"text":"Today I decided to order some Brussels sprouts which have lemon garlic butter you know your average.... took one bite and they were  sooo sour, as if I order lemons itself horrible how do you mess up the simplest thing.... first and last time worst experience ever"}
{"text":"1st time to lazy dogs cafe in downtown summerlin  . Service was outstanding , 
Food good and came promptly. Good size portions . 
Had the lettuce wrap of minced pork side dressing of teriyaki sauce small cucumber salad on dish . We shared an order of sweet potato nuggets . None in our group cared for them . 
It was a Sat . Lunch time very busy . So noise level was high. Overall fun place . Nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"I asked the hostess what was her favorite meal and she said Bahama Chicken raving about the spicy mango... So I ordered it to be disappointed that they changed their menu two days ago.   The server was somewhat confrontational when I asked about the mango salsa... Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"The hush puppy appetizer was out of this world. and you can take your pup on the balcony! Which is usually packed."}
{"text":"Food is really good. 

Great variety and affordable.

My favorites so far is the pot roast.  Sticky ribs was aite. The calamari can be a meal on its own and the hush puppies are a good appetizer to start with.

Service is good, but I took off two stars cuz we asked for our bill, but weren't done eating yet.  They were just busy and we did not want to flag him down later when we were ready to leave.  Anyways a busser pretty much came and like waited by our table which was super awkward and made us feel very uncomfortable.  He also kept talking to my son and asked if we were done with certain plates so he could take it up.  

It felt as if they were trying to rush us out, and lost out on a couple more bucks for tip... Oh well on you...

I will still probably come back here since my first two times were good experiences...hopefully this was just that \"one time\" experience."}
{"text":"Been here once since it opened. Had the salmon dish which was tasty. Have a nice outdoor patio and really cool fire pit on patio. Good for dog owners. I love dogs but I had a dog who kept bumping into my chair all through dinner. Some people don't have consideration for others. Had to take a star off because this place does NOT take reservations unless it's for 7 or more people. Come on people, that is ridiculous and a turn off for those of us who like to plan ahead."}
{"text":"Gotta say we LOVE this place. We r staying at Red Rock Hotel b decided to walk over. Best choice. Excellent service, we sat at the bar, great choices of beer and food was awesome. We had the hummus n a pizza. LOVED both."}
{"text":"Love love love lazy dog First visit was Halloween and the dogs in costumes were totes adorbes. If the dogs on patio atent your thang never fear, the inside is huge.. bar area rocks. Happy hour and reverse happy hour available . Have stayed to.study late at the bar while drinking and wasn't even bugged for closing the place down with nose in chemistry book. Sunday brunch on patio rocks during great weather, and fire pit for ambience out there too weather permitting. Bring your dog and favorite beeoches. You wont regret it. Oh and grab a flight to get your taste.buds on a roll.... over. :)"}
{"text":"The environment is warm and approachable the food are big portions for a good price. It's a great restaurant I do remembers it."}
{"text":"We came here after a hike at Red Rocks with two friends that brought dogs. Needless to say, the name was kind of a give-away that this place is pet friendly with a large accommodating patio to sit in.

Food was good. We had a tuna steak burger which came with a nice slaw. We also had a tater tot and carnitas hash, which I would have again. For libations they had fun lemonades and a nice beer selection, too."}
{"text":"This place is great to watch any sports at. The staff is friendly, the food is amazing and the prices are perfectly affordable. Love this place I found. This is officially my new hangout with my hubby."}
{"text":"Jen is one of the most friendly server we have ever had. I have been here once before, and we came back because we loved the food. This time, we really loved our service. Everyone was so friendly and fun, and really made this trip for my Texas cousins even better. She even saw us struggling to take a group photo, and offered to take it for us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came to dine at Lazy Dog, we can not comment on the food because we were never offered drinks, water or food. We were seated at a table and forgotten.  It was around 4 pm when we arrived to the restaurant and it was not busy.  We waited about 10 minutes and decided to leave. We've eaten at this location before and the service was great.  I can not understand what happen."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local spots and we go there regularly. The menu has a great selection and is sure to have something for any member of your party. My problem is always trying to decide which of their great items I want to choose during any given visit. I love their chicken pot pie, the beef dip sandwich. beef pot roast dinner and schnitzel (seasonal item).

They only reason that they don't get a five star rating is due to the spotty nature of their service. On more than one occasion, we have sat for up to 10 minutes before ever having a server appear to greet us. We have had some really good servers and we have had some rather poor ones. It is a crap shoot as to which you will get when you are taken to your table.

But, bottom line, the food is great, the portions are large and the prices are reasonable. We never hesitate to take our out of town guests there and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: Very Good:

  Lazy Dog is a California - based casual family owned restaurant chain that opened this 10,696 square foot restaurant in late 2014 (Eater Las Vegas). Despite its roots southwest of Las Vegas in Southern California it's inspiration is northeast of Las Vegas in the snow capped mountains of Jackson's Hole, Wyoming. Owner Chris Simms was a fan of the ski lodge where he would spend a plentiful of time in a place that had warmth and excitement. He came up with starting a restaurant that resembles a ski lodge. It is fitting that he was getting into the restaurant business since his parents started Miami's Cafe. Chris Simms was also inspired by a lazy dog that hung out in the lodge. Here is an excerpt from the Lazy Dog website:

\" Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that \"lazy dog' by the fire.\"

  I am also a fan of the lodge. Unfortunately Red Rock Canyon a spot where I hike, is in need of a lodge. Fortunately this replica of a lodge is a few miles east in the northwest quadrant of downtown Summerlin closer to Red Rock Casino than to Macy's. Recently, we'd end up here twice after Red Rock Canyon. 

 The visits started out fresh with plenty of parking. The nearby seasonal ice skating rink compliments the lodge theme. 

  As soon as we walked in I noticed a wire statue of a dog. Adorning the walls there are more pictures of dogs. And toward the back by the open kitchen there is another wire dog statue. Until I read the back story, I was thinking,  \"what  is the deal with all these dog pictures?\" I was impervious to the fact that there is a dog friendly patio where the food is for the people and the dogs. 

   My food wasn't for the dogs. On both post-hiking meals, I ordered off the lunch special. On the first visit I spent $8.50 on the chicken parmesan with pasta and on the second I spent $8.50 on the fired-wok chicken over rice. This was before the fountain beverage. The food was good. Missing from the Lazy Dogs dining experience is complimentary house bread. The scenery makes up for it. 

   True to Chris Simm's intentions the inside resembles a lodge. My eyes took in an interior design that merges urban with lodge. In the center is a large bar adorned with a sundry of flat screen TV. In the back is the open kitchen. Through out the restaurant are the dog pictures and statues. There is one wall near the rest rooms that is adorned with license plates. Just like a lodge there is plenty of space in a room with a moderate to low noise level. 

   Walking from one dog picture adorned wall to the other were the servers. In similar fashion to the dogs in the pictures, they smiled. The servers were friendly and efficient. 

   My return factor is foreseeable. In the near future I would like to try their newer and second location that opened up in Town Square. In writing this review I am spreading the word that Lazy Dog is an upbeat replica of a lodge where people and dogs can enjoy good food."}
{"text":"This was a great night out. In need of a place for 12 people to celebrate, we chose this restaurant as it is in a central location. The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful with splitting checks and getting food out all together. 

I chose the hatch Chile Mac and cheese  and my yelp check-in Cajun fries. The Mac and cheese came out super hot and had a nice kick to them. The Cajun fries were great to share as well. 

We also shared a pitcher of red pomegranate sangria which gave over 6 glasses and was not as sweet as I expected (I was very happy with this). 

I'd recommend coming in for happy hour as there are some great deals that are great for sharing. You can also bring your dog if you're sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"UPDATE 06/14/18

I'm changing my review to 5 stars because this restaurant is the only place I go now with my dog. I've probably had everything on their menu by now and the quality of food and drinks is awesome. Service is great too! I can take my dog to any restaurant with a patio in Downtown Summerlin but we just keep coming back to this place all the time! The vibe is awesome and my beagle likes socializing with other pups. It's very easy to drop $100 on dinner for 2 people here but it's totally worth it! 


UPDATE 8/10/17

Food quality and selection has improved amazingly since my last review. Everything tastes delish and I especially like ahi tuna with coconut curry cauliflower purée. We keep coming back to this joint all the time because of the dog friendly patio and chill vibe. However, Lazy Dogs service is still major HIT or MISS and one time it was so bad that the manager ended up comping our drinks. I'm not sure why they can't hire more people to fix this issue. 

---
I've been here 3 times and it's always HIT or MISS. The only reason why I keep coming back is location and dog friendly patio (btw, a lot of restaurants with patios allow dogs, so the concept isn't new). 

The food is definitely just OK. We ordered roasted brussel sprouts and they were burnt, swimming in oil and lemon dressing. I can do better at home. Same thing happened with my chopped salad - lemon dressing was overpowering and my dog's chicken tasted better than the one in my salad. I sent my dish back and got tacos which were not bad. 

Drinks are great. I ordered Blueberry martini made with natural ingredients and it was phenomenal. 

Dog menu is just chicken and rice and portions are huge, suitable for a great dane and not a beagle (which is my dog). 

Last but not least, service. Well... that's another hit & miss here. Sometimes it's slow and they forget your order and sometimes it's pretty good.

Bottom line - next time we are going to try another place and just take food to go and eat it by the \"rock\" fountain."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely excellent, not only due to the great food and drinks--but overall due to the INCREDIBLE service we got from Jennifer B. She was an absolute blast, she was very attentive, made great recommendations, and each time she left our table we could not stop mentioning how great she was. She is an absolute star (a 5 star to be exact(;), we will definitely be back because of her!! See you next time, Jennifer!!"}
{"text":"Come for the doggos, stay for the doggos. Pet ALL the doggos. Did I mention doggos?????

Last time I went to Lazy Dog and saw people sitting INSIDE, I almost ran through the restaurant screaming \"Do you know what is just outside those doors???? Puppies! Dogs! Furry creatures! Why are you not outside giggling over the cuteness of all the doggos?!\" 

Our four legged friends get their own menu at Lazy Dog (chicken or burger with brown or white rice btw) and these guys love it! Also, watching my Goldendoodle ( @boomgoesthedoodle on Insta) impatiently await the arrival of his burger, as his head whips around each time a server passes him by, makes me say, \"Same.\"

Oh, right, they also serve people food. Everything is prepared from scratch (no frozen bagged fries here) and all in all, it's a solid meal. They're good about customizing and have a nice happy hour.

If you need some stress relief and a solid meal, get a table on the patio and pet a few pups."}
{"text":"was pleasantly surprised with the great food and house IPA at Lazy Dog in Las Vegas! We had the Pesto Pasta with Chicken! It was so unique and yummy! great mix of flavors. the Pesto and sun-dried tomato,  mushroom and broccoli were all fresh! Service was good.
Woukd recommend!"}
{"text":"We came for our dog's birthday and had an incredible time! The service was absolutely amazing! Many thanks to our server, Mason, and the manager, Rachel, for making our evening so great! We had hush puppies, queso dip, sticky ribs, tortilla soup, tuna salad, wedge salad, kid's cheeseburger (with havarti cheese), kid's milkshake, and the s'more dessert: everything was delicious! Our pug, Philomena, especially enjoyed her burger and rice meal. This may be our new favorite place in town. Excellent food and even better service and atmosphere - plus, you can bring your dog! What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog is the best restaurant in town for dining with your dog. Also a awesome place for us humans too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. Prices are fair, I just get over how yummy the food was. Also very clean for a place that allows dogs."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. Atmosphere is very nice and clean.  I got lucky as we didn't have a wait time during lunch. The service was quick and very accomodating, as we needed to switch the bread on one of the sandwiches. I would truly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I won a couple of gift cards from the radio station (shout out to 106.5!!) for this restaurant. Came in around 11:30 AM on a Saturday. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. 

They have a new cute menu! I don't think they have any new food items added but just made it more aesthetically pleasing. We ordered from the lunch menu, which is served daily til 4 PM. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my friend ordered the fish & chips. If you check in on Yelp, they provide you with a big order of cajun fries. The fries came out first & they kinda overdid it with the seasoning lol. It was a little like Cajun seasoning with a side of fries. It wasn't bad though. Our food came out maybe 10 mins after the fries did. The shrimp tacos were alright. The plate came with 2 tacos, rice, and beans. The taco was really messy to eat since it only came with one really skinny tortilla so it ripped easily & everything came out lol. I do like that they don't skimp out on shrimp. 

Service was alright. I don't quite remember our server's name but he did a fine job. 

Overall, lazy dog was just okay for me - not spectacular but not bad."}
{"text":"This was the first lazy dog in Vegas. I'm so glad they opened up another in closer to my house! Anyway, the first time I visited this place was about 2 years ago. You can bring your pets with you, but you'll be seated outside on the patio. 

I've ordered a few things from here but one of my favorites is the Alfredo fettuccini with shrimp. Sooo yums! It's hard to mess up pasta lol but theirs is very creamy and the pasta is cooked well. It comes with 2 pieces of pita crackers? I think that's what it is. & they definitely don't skimp on the shrimp! I'm not quite sure what the name of the dessert I took a pic of but it was delicious! It was shared between a couple of people & was enjoyed by every single one of them. 

If I remember correctly, the lighting is pretty dim, especially when it's already dark outside lol. Will definitely be back but probs to the location closer to home!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here for brunch, and it was exceptional! I would recommend this place over many brunch places in Vegas. There are $5 mimosas, bellinis, and bloody Mary's. We got the carnitas hash and strawberry French toast. The French toast was the perfect amount of sweetness and was very light. The carnitas hash = amazing!!! I ate every last bite. Poached eggs (perfectly poached), sweet potato tots (yum), peppers, onions, cheese, and not to mention the delicious pork! I will definitely be coming back here just for that. Service is great as well. My only con is that there are no misters on the patio, so eating outside during the summer is not a good idea."}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere and if you have dogs, this place is so awesome. I love the Dog Menu and canine-friendly patio. Very cool. The menu is eclectic and it's a great spot for a big group since there seems to be something for everyone. The Kids Menu was equally great with several options that you don't normally see. There was edamame as an appetizer and Ruben's nephew enjoyed that!

Cajun Fries ($5.50): Really tasty fries. I love Cajun seasoning and these fries are just done right. This large serving is easily shared! I didn't like the Chipotle Ranch that comes with the appetizer. I'd request regular ranch dressing.

Wok-Fired Calamari ($10.75): Calamari strips tossed in sweet soy plum sauce; topped with peanuts, bell peppers, green onions, sesame seeds. We opted for brown rice (no additional charge). The calamari was okay, though I didn't care for the dish overall. The sauce that doused everything was grossly sweet and sticky. Not my type of \"Asian\" dish.

Chicken Poblano ($13.95): Chicken breast sauteed with sweet white corn, peppers, and onions in a roasted pobalno cream sauce, served with crispy tamale cakes, micro cilantro, and tapatio crema. This was really tasty. The chicken was nice and the sauces were flavorful. I really enjoyed the crispy tamale cakes! The dish was more spicy than I expected, so it was slightly difficult to eat (you should take the spicy icon on the menu seriously!).

I certainly enjoyed the food a lot more than I expected from this type of restaurant, but it's not a place I'd be clamoring to return."}
{"text":"First of all, Brussels sprouts! The food was fresh and tasty and our little furry child enjoyed sitting out on the patio eating dinner with her family. David was our waiter. He was extremely attentive and very nice. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"I went here based on Yelp reviews and as usual, fellow yelpers did not let me down. 

The restaurant is located in the new downtown area.  

Upon entering I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and offered to sit either inside or outside.  The wait was 45 minutes.  There were plenty of seats at the bar so We sat at the bar.  

The inside of the restaurant has a great atmosphere and I personally love the decor. It's a combination of wood and stone. There are cool metal sculptures of dogs and some other animals in the place.  

The bartender was awesome.  He made some recommendations regarding the local beer selection. He was more than willing to provide some samples if we were not sure how a particular beer would taste. Based on his recommendations I went with the bad beat beer and was not disappointed.  Obviously beer is personal and what I like, others may not like.  

After what seemed like a short wait, we were escorted to a table. 

Jennifer, the waitress, quickly greeted us and brought some waters for the table.  She was just awesome.  Incredibly friendly and willing to help us in any way possible.  

For an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip and edamame.  Both were excellent but everyone agreed the edamame had a little too much salt.  They were dusted with a spicy run with sesame seeds.  It really gave a nice kick to the edamame but had just a little too much salt.  

For dinner I went with the chipotle chicken.  I was a little concerned that the chipotle part was a chipotle cream.  I asked Jennifer if I could have it on the side.  Her response was the kitchen will make any meal the way I want it.  That impressed me!!  Quite honestly I did not expect that.  I was glad I had it on the side.  For me, it would have been a little too heavy for the dish. I am not into heavy cream sauces on chicken.  

Everyone at the table enjoyed their respective meals.  Everyone agreed the meals had great flavor, were cooked perfectly and everything on the dish had separate flavors and did not taste bland.  

I didn't have any dessert but a lot of people at other tables were eating the butter cake.  

Overall a great place and the price was great.   Very reasonable. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So I love the food here. BUT the service is sooooo slow. No matter what day or time we come my food and drinks take forever. It's so annoying because if I'm on a time constraint and only have an hour for lunch I can't trust this place because I'm always late  and have to ask where my food is and where my check is. I always want dessert but never have time and it's gotta be the kitchen because the service time is always the same. Once I get my check I'm practically running out of here to get back to work. 

But get this... we go to California pizza kitchen, yard house, or Miller's and never have this problem ever. 

So I'm officially done coming to this place."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant in DT Summerlin. Love the outdoor seating!
Everything we've ordered has been delicious!  There is always a crowd but
we've never had to wait long. 
Everyone has been very nice here. 
The server's names I remember are Shaun and Omar, maybe because they were so nice and attentive.  
If you sign up online you will receive a free starter or dessert for your Birthday & Anniversary!!
Very reasonably priced and so much food!
We Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is definitely the type of place I would recommend for a group of friends (or a date!) to enjoy a casual atmosphere where there's plenty of superior quality bar food AND well-placed TVs to watch the game. 

Our server was very attentive and helpful throughout our meal. I would definitely recommend the Ginger Beer ($3.75) along with the Lemon Caper Chicken ($11.95) because that's exactly what I had and I loved it. Some of the meals are a little more pricey but you'll definitely get what you pay for (my father-in-law loved the lamb shank, and my husband couldn't stop raving about the mashed potatoes he got with his garlic butter steak). 

They did accidentally charge us for our free cajun fries (yelp check-in) but then corrected it when we pointed it out, so just make sure you double check that before paying. 

My only regret is that I didn't have room to try the butter cake! Next time I'm signing up for their rewards program and then getting it free ;-)"}
{"text":"Recently stopped in for dinner

I had the portobello sandwich with cajun fries. In my opinion, the food was just OK. I found that there was more bread than anything else. The bread overwhelmed the small portobello cap. I think the fries might have been sitting for a while, they didn't come off as fresh. 

Server was friendly and the food came out quickly. The restaurant itself was clean. They have an outdoor patio area which allows dogs but is also very clean. In my opinion, it was just the quality of the food which could be improved."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour!  Location is great, and it's nice to sit out on the patio. The food is good, just not great, but the price is right. I recommend it."}
{"text":"We came in with a large group last weekend and had really great service.
For as large of a group that we were, the service was awesome. Everyone had everything they needed in a timely manner. Our servers Carrie and one other (I forgot her namesorry) were very attentive and friendly. I'm sure any large group can be a bit of a pain but thankfully we all had a great time, ate great food and had exceptional service. Thank you to our servers, the manager I spoke to and all the other team members that came by our table dropping off food, only to be asked for more stuff! Lol
They were all very nice and helpful. 
You guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon Lazy Dog last night! What a FABULOUS PLACE!!! Brandon was our most excellent waiter!! He was a joy to visit with!! The food......Candied Bacon!!!!!  Who doesn't like bacon!! The cocktails were also fantastic!! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was friendly and fast. The beer and cokes in glasses tasted like lemons. It could be how they are washing it. We were having a business meeting dinner inside so it was a bit loud. Talking to the person 2 seats away in front of you is hard. They do have a large outside patio if you don't mind the heat at this time of year.

The place is very large and basically looks like a modern cowboy saloon."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday afternoon. Jennifer waited on us. Very nice and funny. Great service. I had the roast beef dip with Caesar salad. Very good! Hubby had chicken Parmesan he ate it all! So very good."}
{"text":"Lazy Dogs continues to be a great place to have some excellent cocktails and food! I was here for their soft opening, and the service is still outstanding. I received the cajun french fries as the free appetizer for checking in on Yelp. They came hot and fresh. The spicy mac & cheese was an excellent choice. It had chili's puréed with the breadcrumbs on top. It was slightly spicy but not overwhelming. The grapefruit cocktail was refreshing. They used freshly squeezed juice which makes all of the difference!"}
{"text":"Like the menu. Food is pretty good. Like the ambience as well. Unfortunately this is our second time when the service was terrible. Food took 45 minutes to come. And some people got their food before others. They tried to serve us the wrong food at first. And then they tried to serve our food to another table. I wish management would get it together. I would like to come back and regular here as we work close. But at this time would not recommend and will not come back. Don't come here unless you have an hour and a half to two hours for your meal. We got the Amex card notification that they ran our card. It's been 8 minutes since the notification, we are still waiting for our credit card back....Chaos."}
{"text":"This is my first time being here and holy crap am I in love! We were seated by the hostess who was super friendly (unfortunately I don't remember her name) she sat us in a booth right next to the fire place which had a nice fire going, and the booth was a little secluded  (which we liked). Amy, our server greeted us on a very timely manner with a beautiful and welcoming smile. She had no problem in grabbing me a sample of the red ale they have on tap, that they brew themselves. We ordered a couple small plates such as the hush puppies (10/10) Brussel sprouts, and meatballs. All were quite delicious. My boyfriend also got a Ceasars salad and the pulled pork sandwich, the Apple cider vinegar in the Cole slaw is a great touch. All in all we are very happy costumers and we will surely be back! ASK FOR AMY!"}
{"text":"I was happy with this place. I had the chicken enchiladas from the skinny menu, and they were very filling and satisfying. My husband had the BLT and tortilla soup. Their messed up and put mayo on his sandwich even though he asked them not to, so the manager bought us dessert. That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of drafts. The Bartender made a couple of not-bad-not-great cocktiels. We ordered french fries, the potato wasn't the best, however, the sauce was great. Good prices"}
{"text":"Hmm, we've been there quite a few times and always had great food and awesome service. Tonight the food was as good but the service was waaaaay off. Took forever to get everything and they totally forgot a couple of the sides and our dog's order!!! Hoping it was just an off night because we love Lazy Dog!"}
{"text":"The experience here can be summed up in one word.... HORRIBLE!! The service staff left us feeling like we were a bother to their day. Very uncomfortable atmosphere. 

From start to finish this place was a disaster. Our \"server\" was so bizarre. When she finally came over to our table she never introduced herself so we never knew her name. She took our drink order then returned about 15 mins later to take our food order by saying \"do you know what you want?\"
Never offered specials/recommendations or asked if we had any questions about the menu. 

Long story short, our side salads came out(which was wrong) then 5 mins later our appetizers came out then 1 min later our entrees came out. So basically our burgers were cold by the time we were ready to eat them. 

Our waitress was aware that she was struggling to stay afloat, but kept laughing and joking about it. There was nothing funny about it. 

I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone. There are soooooo many other options to eat in a 1 mile radius. My advice is to avoid this place altogether. Don't say you weren't warned. 

P.S. After reading other reviews this seems to be a on-going issue with the service staff. So obviously \"management\" does not value your feedback...  Such a bizarre operation.

See below:
Cookie cutter corporate response. No thanks."}
{"text":"Kristine and Jen have made our experiences multiple times now. They  have been phenomenal! We frequently eat out and this will certainly be our regular spot. Great menu, service and environment. It is often after bad service that you jump to write a review as it is noteworthy... they have been so great and personable that I had to write this. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lazy dog was pretty busy for an off lunch hour. Black and blue burger was incredible. Also got fries and ranch. Friends got lettuce wraps and side of green beans/half sandwich and cup of soup. Everything was excellent. Sandwich had a lot of avocado. The reason for three stars is that I waited for my food for at least ten minutes after everyone else. The waiter came by a couple times to acknowledge my food was coming but there was no apology. I will still most likely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant and delicious food. Sat out on the patio with my golden retriever. :) Customer service was great and the food was perfect. My dog enjoyed her hamburger and brown rice. Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great happy hour. We sit on the patio. Good apps. Service here is improving every time."}
{"text":"If you consider your dogs as part of the family, this is the best place to bring them. They even have their own doggy menu. You will need to eat outside if you bring your dog, however they do have heaters during the winter, but not sure what they would do for our scorching hot Vegas summers. 

The menu is pretty extensive and has lots of options. If your craving it, they most likely have it here. We stuck to brunch this time though cuz we went in the morning. I ordered a Coutry Fried Chicken over Biscuits. I think the portion was just perfect. Not too small where ur still hungry and not too big where u feel over stuffed and wasting food. The plate is served with a homemade biscuit split open over sauce, boneless fried chicken served over the biscuits and topped off with two sunny eggs. Delicious!
My friend ordered the Blueberry Pancakes and they came with a BACON BUTTER with actual bacon pieces in it. Pancakes were nice and fluffy. 
We each got an alcoholic drink. I got a Moscow Mule, which i believe on the menu it said it was only 160 calories. And my friend got a Mimosa. 
Will definitely come back!"}

{"text":"Always a great experience and my fur babies love it, the manager Tony is so pleasant and professional, definitely recommend it. Our server Denise was wonderful."}
{"text":"Food, cleanliness is good. Second time they served me the same salad wrong. And when i said something, the mgr tried to act like its no big deal. Unprofessional mgr and server. Once corrected, the food and ingredients are good quality."}
{"text":"It was my friend and I's first time eating at this restaurant and heard about how great the food was over here, so we were definitely looking forward to trying it! 
First impression? No greeting. Right when we walked in, all we saw were the young staff huddled together talking. It wasn't til moments later when one of the hostesses finally noticed us, and seated us at a table. By that point we were already annoyed. The host staff should be setting the tone on a good dining experience. 
Other than that, our server was delightful and the food lived up to our expectations. Absolutely delicious. Definitely try the small hummus plate, we couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"Heard many times that I need to try this place.  It did not tip any scales for me.  Food was OK and the service should have been much better.  I rarely leave less than a 20% tip and I did here.  Drinks were not refilled and were not served as ordered.  Probably won't be back unless I want to go chill with my dog."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog has good food for a decent price! If you check in you get a plate of Cajun fries. It's a pretty large portion. They also have a wide selection of beers and their happy hour menu has good options. The service I had today wasn't that great but I've been here a couple times and the food has always been good & the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Orange, I often went to the location on Katella. I find the food here super tasty. This location is just as fun with delicious food. It's also a beautiful spot. One side has a beautiful view of the mountains, and another side has a gorgeous view of the strip. We ordered light and tried the seared tuna salad with an appetizer of the garlic flat bread. Both were delicious, particularly the salad. The tuna tasted fresh. Then we caved and ordered dessert - the peach raspberry pie. It comes with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was refreshing and tasted like the perfect summer dessert, eating it and watching the sunset. Service was great. Definitely a great place for relaxing, awesome food, and spending time with friends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, plenty of craft beers to choose from and friendly staff. Ashley was courteous, friendly and checked on us regularly. If you need advice on an order, try the ribs, or the favorite of the Clubhouse. When in Summerlin, check out Lazy Dog!"}
{"text":"First-- we had a group of 14 and no reservation on a Saturday night... They were able to accommodate us which was really cool! We sat outside on the patio - they have heat lamps and a HUGE fire pit! So it was warm. 

The food was delicious! We had everything going on at our table from lettuce wraps to steak! EVERYTHING was so good! The service was really good too! Super nice, organized, and had no problem splitting the check up. We always had drinks and were being paid attention to! 

After we ate we moved over to the fire pit for another drink before leaving. The ambience is so nice. Very relaxed, friendly, clean (even with dogs allowed). 

I really appreciated them getting us in like they did and taking such good care of my crazy group of friends! 

I definitely recommend the lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Took our big girl on a date to Lazy Dog today and had a great experience. The people food was good, service friendly and the staff was welcoming to our pet.

{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few co-workers and had a great time! We first all met at the bar for a cocktail, service was fast, friendly and even accommodated my request to change the tv station! Soon after we made our way to the table and was greeted by our server Steve! He was very interactive with our group, quite funny! We ordered apps at his recommendation and they where fantastic as well as our dinner and desert! He did everything right to set the best atmosphere for us, we can't wait to return!! Thanks for a great night Lazy Dogs(and Steve)"}
{"text":"Last time I went we waited an hour for our food. They were really busy, but they took care of our bill since we waited so long. 
 
If you want to bring your pup, you need to sit out in the patio. You're not allowed to have your dog sit on your lap either. Only food options for dogs is either hamburger patty with brown rice or grilled chicken and brown rice. They also get a complimentary water bowl. 

As for humans.. they have a good lunch menu, decently priced, but so-so on the taste factor."}
{"text":"I don't like chain restaurants so this might be my bias here but I wasn't impressed with this place.   Reminds me of claim jumper back in the day.  There was nothing wrong with it...the food was ok and the patio was nice but there was nothing special either."}
{"text":"Great food and superior service!  Will be back for more!  Chicken pot pie was comforting..."}
{"text":"I'm really being generous with 2 stars.
The hostess was friendly - I guess she deserves the 2 stars.
Don't get me wrong, I am a dog lover, but my dog is 6.5 lbs and a non-shedder, very well mannered, never makes a sound in public. Does not beg, bark or bite.
With that being said, I took my dog and sat on the patio. She sat under my chair without making a peep. Out of courtesy of others, I would never bring a shedding dog to an outdoor patio. Have some respect - not everyone likes dog hair in their food!!!
I should have expected that with so much advertising as \"dog-friendly\" that the patio floor would be filthy and it was. Clumps of dog hair all over the floor, dog hair flying all thru the air! Gross!!! Their \"dog rules\" clearly states no dogs on chairs or in laps, the lady at the table next to me held her dog in her lap the whole time. Some kind of big dog at another table was licking a soon-to-be occupied table! DISGUSTING FOR THE POOR PEOPLE THAT WAS NEXT FOR THAT TABLE. Dogs are dogs, people please control your dogs, or better yet, leave them at home if they shed, bark, beg or bite!
The waitress/server said, \"I'll bring your dog some water\". I said, \"thank you\". 20 min later, no water. Asked for water, she blamed it on someone else. 
Asked for Parm cheese for my pizza, half way thru my pizza, she brings the cheese.
I ask for a to-go box, waited 15 min - had to ask again.
My dog wouldn't even drink out of their water dish because it had dog hair (not her's) floating around in it.
Please, Lazy Dog - make some rules...... half off a section for dogs and half for no dogs.
i will probably never go back, but if I ever do - I will not bring a dog and will not sit outside on the filthy dog-hair, barking, begging, licking dogs everywhere patio!
Also, with so many dogs shedding and shaking, if you don't get dog hair in your food outside, you are likely to get it in your food inside because the hair is flying around in the air, sticking to the servers clothes, they walk inside, take the dog hair with them! ughhhh, I'm done with my rant!"}
{"text":"After a hike at Red Rock, we had brunch at Lazy Dogs!

We all liked what we ordered. I was crazy about their sweet potato tater tots!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Rachel our server was delightful. Also the manager Tony stopped by as well such a nice guy and so polite. Not every day a manager stops by and does a table touch to see how our meal was.  Amazing place to bring ur fur baby sit on the patio and enjoy a quick snack or have a relaxing dinner. Plenty of tvs to watch any game. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I finally found a place that I can bring my pup and they even have a dog menu!!! 
Moving from Los Angeles where almost every restaurant has a patio and is pet friendly, I was so happy to hear about this place!

My party of 4 (3 plus a dog) showed up for lunch at around 11:30am. The hostess saw us from afar once we parked and walked towards us to greet us warmly. This was such a nice gesture. It really made us feel welcome, especially since it was all of our first time coming to the restaurant. We were seated immediately and introduced to put server. I wish I got everyone's name but I was too busy running around making sure Hilo (my dog) was secured appropriately (his leash tied to a chair). The server was very professional, very nice and accommodating. He brought out a water bowl for the dog immediately.

The server brought out a complimentary flat bread for first timers, which was very tasty. We ordered an Poke Bowl, Ahi Tuna Salad, Hawaiian Ribs with fries, Edamame, and a Tuna and Walnut Sandwich. All great choices but my absolute favorite were the ribs! Definitely a must try!!!

Before our meal came out, the manager also introduced himself to us. The staff really goes above and beyond to make sure everyone feels welcomed and it did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.

Hilo my dog is on a raw diet so he unfortunately could not try anything from the dog menu but we will definitely be coming back as he loved the restaurant and the staff!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food, drinks, the atmosphere is great! I've ordered small plates and appetizers to share and everything came out delicious. The location is easy to find since it's around downtown summerlin. I love that they have both outdoor n indoor dining so customer get to choose where they want to sit. 

I like the fried bacon, green beans, but ahi tuna, the calamari, and the cheese dip was ok to me. I like their white peach sangria. Must try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Lazy Dog on Sunday afternoon. I have Celiac Disease which means I am completely gluten free. Not only did Lazy Dog provide a separate Gluten Free menu, but the Executive Chef, Juan was extremely attentive and interactive with the gluten free accommodations. We ordered nachos, buffalo cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tortilla soup, and the halibut. Everything was AMAZING. Our waiter, Daniel, was also awesome. Between the food and over the top staff, I would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time and I wanted to give my props. I'm glad this place is here. I am in the neighborhood a few times a week with time to spare and this is a perfect spot. First off my dog is welcome on the patio and they have a menu for him. The patio is large, airy and comfortable. I had items off the happy hour menu this time. Edamame with garlic and chili flakes and some orange added. Delicious, probably my favorite edamame so far. I also had the Ahi poke jar. Sashimi grade ahi with peanut vinaigrette, avocado, pickled cukes with a wasabi dressing served with wonton chips. Very very good. My Dog (BurgerMeister) had 2 items. The burger patty with brown rice as well as the grilled chicken with brown rice. Perfect by his standards. I also want to mention our server Amy. She was perfectly polite and very pleasant. Lots of dogs on the patio so it was a very happy environment. If you don't like dogs then stay home."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come to this restaurant because I always see the parking lot busy & being from Montana I love anything with a mountain-like feel. The ambiance is great inside & I love that they allow dogs. 

The food here was great! I could probably eat the Grizzly Fries all night long. The lemonades are tangy, yet yummy. The sticky ribs with the plum sauce were amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the umami fries. They tasted bland & lacking that delicious umami taste. I'd definitely recommend the buffalo chicken lollipops to start. 

I wanted to give this place 4-5 stars but I was so upset with the lack of customer service that I do not want to come back at all. Our server Yanique was basically a ghost, which was odd because she servers tables all around us & seemed wonderful. She would chit chat & check back on people constantly. My husband & I, barely saw her at all. Anytime anything was delivered it was by someone else. It took forever to get even a water. She never asked how our food was, never asked if we needed anything else, never asked if we'd like dessert...I've only ever experienced this kind of service once before & it was poor service based on racial discrimination because my husband is black & I am an Asian woman. I sincerely hope this is not the case but that's the only difference I can see between our table & the other table served around us. When we spend $60+ on a meal I at minimum expect to be treated well."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice patio. Yes I know  it's 105 degrees outside but with it being covered and having the \"swamp coolers\" running was surprisingly pleasant. We only enjoyed a few appetizers and the Mimosa flight. Best part was got to enjoy the food and drinks along side our new puppy who is always welcome here. They even brought out some nice ice water in a bowl for Nala (our puppy). Will definitely be returning to try out some more menu items."}
{"text":"From the second we walked in and were greeted by Skoobie it was a great experience. Food servers were all very pleasant and courteous. The energy and positive vibes from the workforce was an added ambiance making our  lunch a great lunch! 
Food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place JUST OPENED yesterday!! The beer was cold, the cocktails were crafty, food was delicious, and my dog was even welcome on the patio! Totally a great addition to Town Square! I love the fire pit on the patio as well! I will definitely have to come back at night to sit by the fire :)"}
{"text":"Above average food, above average prices. Comfortable atmosphere, slow service. If you have more then the average time for lunch then. I would say give it a try. But if you are short on time I would pass. The one thing that angers me is only two handicapped parking spots? 6 take out spots 2 handicapped s"}
{"text":"I really like that this is a dog-friendly bar. 
I sat on the patio with my small dogs. Service was fast. I ordered the tuna poke bowl and the grilled cheese. The poke bowl was disappointing as there was barely any poke - and for $12 it was a underwhelming and overpriced. The grilled cheese was very good though. My dog's chicken and rice was very generous and cheap. I would come back here."}
{"text":"It's a version of yard house with less beer options, when it comes to the menu. I got the ahi tuna burger, it was okay at best. I asked for the tuna to be rare and it was basically cooked through. It made the tuba ends hard. Thy also used a wasabi sauce that did not mix well. But! The Cajun fries with garlic sauce were good."}
{"text":"Lazy Dogs is awesome! The kids had a great meal, a creative build your own sundae dessert, and enjoyed watching all the dogs outside!! The service was fantastic and everyone, including management, were attentive! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie. I was disappointed because it was dry. 
Our server, Jimmy, dropped by and noticed I was not eating the pot Pie, but eating the rest of my daughters TexMex salad(which was delicious).  I told Jimmy the Pie was dry. He insisted upon making this right and had me order another meal. I said that was I was full, so it was ok. Jimmy told me to order and they will prepare it to go. Later on the manager dropped by to apologize and made sure I had my to go meal.
Excellent customer service!  I my daughter had the TexMex salad and our friend had a chicken sandwich that  was also delicious. Nice atmosphere, no smoking, clean bathrooms, excellent mojitos! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty standard 5 star review:

One star for cleanliness.
One star for friendliness.
One star for comfort.
One star for timeliness of service.
One star for high quality food.

I come here every time I charge my Tesla. Love this place!"}
{"text":"WOW! This restaurant is beautiful!!! Great service, fresh food, yummy drinks! I love lazy dog!"}
{"text":"Nice comfort food restaurant.  Service was outstanding, apps were excellent, especially the nachos.  Main courses were huge and flavorful, bring your appetite.  Bison meatloaf was unique and my wife enjoyed the pot roast.  Also, very reasonable on the price, we will return."}
{"text":"Came here for a soccer dinner with 50+ people...we had an 8:00p reservations and at first a little clunky and didn't end up getting seated  till approximately 8:25 but this was the last of the bumps in the road for our experience here and I have to hand it to both  Ashley and Regan if it wasn't for their teamwork this could've been a recipe for disaster. They got other team members as well as the management staff to kick in, make sure everyone's drinks were full and even brought out some complimentary flat breads for everyone because the food wait was a little long. This was great for the fact all of our girls had just finished playing in a soccer tournament all day. All in all great experience and even though we ended up being there for almost 3 hours really didn't feel like it based on the attentiveness of the wait staff...another call out and wish I caught his name but there was also another key contributor to this night success and he was (sorry no offense if I get this wrong) Asian gentlemen with a black forearm cover up for what i would guess a tattoo that working with these 2 ladies made this night enjoyable...food was also very good and overall night perfect! Nice job Lazy Dog Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My wife picked this location for date night with some friends. To be honest I had never heard of it, and was kinda upset we didn't pick to meet somewhere else, but after this visit I'm sure we will be coming back in the future.

I'm not really sure how you would classify this restaurant, it feels kinda modern, hippy, with a bit of lumber jack ( weird I know ) . 

We walked right in and were instantly seated and given a brief run through of the menu. They have a decent selection of what I would call American food ( a little bit of everything). They have a large selection of beer and drinks , they make a variety of their own brews ( I stuck with the norm good old fashion Budlight) I did like the large portion size for the beer. 
The food, I went with one of my favorite dishes (fish and chips) and to me it was average, not very seasoned, good portion size , liked the fries, but not as good as I had hoped. My friend got a spicy Mexican style chicken sandwich, she was not a fan and actually returned it after finding it had dark meat ( we double checked the menu it does not indicate it will be dark meat chicken). My wife got a bbq ranch bacon burger she was quite happy and really enjoyed it.

Desert for me was the vest part,  I had the warm peach crumble, it was very good, tasted and smelled just like good old Midwest grandma made cobbler.  The wife had a nice chocolate cacke with ice cream. 

So all in all its an ok spot good for an average meal, the atmosphere and ability to chat and eat with no rush or over whelming staff is its biggest plus. Down side the food is ok its worth the money but not the driving factor in attending."}
{"text":"Amazing food & the servers were so nice! The manager even gave me a free dessert for my birthday. We came here from Chicago & the brick oven pizza was awesome! I would come back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very good!! I recommend the Pot Roast!! The people are very nice and I love the cozy feel :)"}
{"text":"Reagan was an AWESOME server and made our first visit to Lazy Dog a great experience. Food was unique and delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love dogs and love the fact that I can bring my dog along. Im here at least once a week and the happy hour is great. Food quality is very good for a bar and grill. Mostly everything made from Scratch!"}
{"text":"It was my families first time here and it won't be our last! 
They offer a \"gluten sensitive\" menu which is a bonus for my daughter and me. 
I opted for the Tex Mex salad which is huge and delicious. It has real chunks of chicken, avacado, black beans, corn, cheese and some tortilla strips along with a delicious chipotle ranch ( which I am told is made in house) and BBQ sauce. My daughter ordered salmon, smashed potatoes and fruit which was a HUGE slice of watermelon. 
The children's menu had the normal offerings and a few extras. My son opted for a burger and fries. He had no complaints. 
My husband ordered the curried tuna which was served over a mashed cauliflower. The cauliflower was so creamy one would think it was potatoes. The tuna was prepared exactly how it was ordered which is nice. 
My middle daughter, the big eater, ordered the chicken pot pie. It was huge and the crust appeared to be very flaky yet held its shape when she peeled it off. Inside held large chunks of real chicken and fresh vegetables. She devoured the whole thing! 
Our waitress, Denise, was great. She kept our drinks full and checked on us even though she seemed busy."}
{"text":"The food is so good! I stopped in today for lunch with my coworkers and I wasn't expecting the food to be so good. Our server Sam was so sweet! She made great food recommendations for us and was super patient with how indecisive I was (I know I can be a pain). She refilled our drinks without us having to ask, I really appreciate that. I was wondering if we were getting special attention or something so I watched her with her other tables and noticed she is just as sweet to them all. She's got a great personality and you can tell she likes what she does. We left there happy today with good food and even BETTER Service! Thank you Sam! We may be back for brunch! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love Town Square + the fact that there's a Lazy Dog here! I love that the Lazy Dog menu has so much variety + their sangria is delicious! 
Samantha was our server + she was extremely attentive + friendly the entire night. She knew the menu + was able to suggest her favorite items as well."}
{"text":"Okay so I have a little obsession with Lazy Dogs.. Only I don't suggest bringing your dog here. I've done it once. Not fun. This place is amazing if you choose to leave your furry friend at home, kinda like you don't have your kid with you. The happy hour is so awesome! I always get the inside out quesadilla, buffalo chicken nuggets and chicken strips! I also get a few new things to try too. The lemon drop Martini my favorite and is $6 on the happy hour menu. They have so many $3-$6 options for drinks and food! It's so yummy, drinks are delish and such a cozy vibe!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food took 45 mins to come out & when it did come out half of the plates were cold. They need a better staff that can keep up with the busy pace."}
{"text":"Today I was in sitting at the bar. The food and service was great. One of your waiters came over to me and sang one of my favorite songs, his name was Alejandro. His personality is great, what an amazing waiter. I would totally come back again due to your wonderful waiter!! High five to Alejandro !!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I happened in on the soft-opening for the Downtown Summerlin location of Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar. Each and every employee we met was awesome, excited, professional yet personable. Drea (Andrea) behind the bar made a wonderful Lemon Drop and her food service skills were impeccable. We can't wait until we return with our friends to enjoy more of what Lazy Dog has to offer. The food was great and portions were large (almost too large on the pasta). The 2 managers I spoke with was excited to be a part of this opening. I took lots of notes as my son-in-law & daughter are opening a restaurant in Perth, Australia and the end of the month. Lazy Dog will be a place we frequent! Thank you for the comped evening & our tip reflected our pleasure! REMEMBER TO TIP FOLKS!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times since it opened.  One time they had lamb dishes available on the menu.  I wish they would bring them back permanently (or a rotation menu featuring lamb) as I can never seem to be there at the \"right time\" of the year.  The food is good to above average.  The chicken lettuce wraps include romaine not bib lettuce.  It just doesn't taste right to me without the bib.  Happy Hour menu had several options which was nice.  I'm not a fan of bar stool height chairs and that is the majority available around the bar in order to get the happy hour menu.  I feel like a kid having to climb up into the chair which is uncomfortable to me (I'm short), but I have to deal with it in order to be in the bar area for the happy hour menu.  More regular table/chair seating around the bar area please.  Staff have always been courteous and efficient.  prices are agreeable.  The women's bathroom is consistently clean and the sink faucets are trendy.  Touch the faucet for water.  I don't see a way to control the water temperature pouring out of the fancy faucet.  Lamb options year round please."}
{"text":"You know it's good if you eat somewhere out of the way 3x while on vacation. Try the loaded potato hushpuppies!"}
{"text":"Came here for the weekend brunch. The doughnut holes with the Nutella are very good, but they don't come with that many, so if you are going with more than 2 people I would order more. The mimosa flight had good juice flavors and comes with a whole bottle of champagne. The Mac and cheese starter with bacon and hatch chilis was actually my favorite. I think next time I'm going to try one of their sweet brunch options because although we all enjoyed the brunch, I wouldn't order what I got again (the carnitas hash). And the others weren't raving about their meals as well. Also as a group of 4 people, the tables are way too small. There wasn't enough room for the big plates along with the drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"We are here for the first time and it won't be our last Tom is awesome and the manager even brought over a complimentary dish for being first timers Thx you for being so great"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and usually I reserve judgement until I have been two times or more but let me just say .. from the moment walking in our hostess Brenda went above and beyond to make sure we found a booth while also being seated in the bar to enjoy happy hour specials ... we arrived on a Friday afternoon and it was fairly busy which is always a good sign..

My date had been here before but this was my first time and I lucked out by having an amazing Waitress named Finn helping us . Hopefully I spelled her name right but either way I definitely recommend asking for her if you head here .. she's not only a beautiful soul ( totally aligns and relates and just shines the light ) she also has killer food recommendations and awesome taste in tv shows .. yes! Even that was discussed ..

Anyone who follows my reviews regularly knows I often suffer from service troubles at some of the strangest places lol but this was a stand out experience ..

I love how it's dog friendly and has such a variety of food .. now is it going to be a gourmet dining experience for the avid foodie.. probably not but over all I had a great time with great company while enjoying some yummy calamari and some fish and chips ..

I look forward to going back to try some beer!"}
{"text":"1at time visiting this restaurant. Truly enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  We ordered the Bison burger and the BBQ burger.  The taste was out of this world but unfortunately it arrived to the table Luke warm and not hot.  Totally unfortunate because the restaurant wasn't very  busy given it was only 10:30 am. 

The decor was wonderful and very welcoming to families and dogs ( even has a dog menu)!!  Overall service could have been faster.  Not at all complaining just surprised given it was relatively slow and seemingly fully staffed.  


Would absolutely try it again!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken Alfredo pasta. Chicken had a very weird consistency and had no taste. The whole dish tasted as if it came from a can. Yuck! Service was not service at all. Atmosphere was awesome and family friendly. My friend had a drink and was better than the food! This place needs to fire all of the chefs!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and had the banana foster French toast, it was ok I thought I could easily make it at home but that's just my opinion. My friend got a pepperoni pizza to go and also thought it was just mediocre. I doubt I'll go back but I do however like a restaurant you can bring dogs in I think that's kinda unique."}
{"text":"Ronnie was the bomb...flexible and attentive without being over bearing! Food was good wings were very saucy but my goodness the dirty dog was to die for"}
{"text":"Crappy, slow service and mediocre food.  I'm not sure why this place receives such rave reviews.  Will most likely try again at another location, maybe I missed something.  

Two stars for ambience and location. 

My side salad was on par with a $1.49 salad from Wendy's.  The fettuccine, which was my main course, was uninspiring.  The noodles were rubbery and the sauce tasted store bought. 

Clean restrooms, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Had family come in from California this weekend and after a little debate and discussion decided to try out this restaurant.
  Wow! We were all so impressed! Friendly staff from the moment we walked in the door. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken. 
   Our waitress was ERIN and she was fantastic!!!
Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive!!! 
 She brought my daughter extra ice for her iced tea without having to be asked (never had that happen before).
  
     All of the food was delicious and fresh! And Erin's suggestion of a rice and shrimp bowl for me was perfect!

   Thank you so much for a Great dining experience!!!
 We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It was a really good find. We ordered the chicken nachos which was good but I wish the qeso was like real qeso. I got the baha cali burger which was as big as my head! Really good and their Cajun fries were salty but the flavor was aite. It was my friends birthday so they gave her a free butter cake.  our server Matthew was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss, service is good, we got seated right away that was nice."}
{"text":"I go to the summerlin one all the time. But the waiter here Gerardo is the man. He knows the menu and very polite. Much respect to him I would come here just for his service."}
{"text":"1st time here and had a great meal. Fantastic service and the manager Brooke was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"let me start out with having \"one of those days\" was not going to help this review. we were waiting for a table and they passed us twice and then when we did get seated no one wanted to state that it was their table after we had to go to the hostess stand and tell them to send over the manager because hopefully they wouldn't be too busy to server us. Well a server came by and state that he noticed that we were sitting for a long time and that he wasn't our server but would be happy to get us started on our drinks, as he was walking away the manager walked up and our actual server was right behind her. The manager said that she was so sorry but there was confusion in who's table it was and that it was cleared up now and that \"she\" (pointing at he server) was here to take our order or answer any questions we had on the menu. The manager offered to comp our appetizers and to let her know if there was anything else she could do for us. She leaves and the server doesn't apologize at all and says so what appetizer would you like......I answered her and said \"ok.....well I'm sorry would be nice considering the other server told us that you were our server and said that you were too buzy to get us and you were trying to get someone else to pick us up\" she snapped back said \"do you want me to server you or not\" I was eye-balled by my family and so I decided to just order and get our food, considering how hungry my family was. It didn't stop there though. She was just rude the rest of the time and I let her know that I would never treat anyone the way she was treating us because it wasn't our fault that she let us hang for 20 minutes without even telling us that she would be with us as soon as she could. Not only that but why she couldn't let her boss know that she needed help with her section. She didn't snapped back this time, but just put the check down and walked away. this was the 1st and last time, never again!!!! I would of gone to the manager about her unbelievable disrespectful attitude, but seriously it was a waste of time....normally a manager thinks the only reason why a customer makes a complaint is to get free food and that is not the case......I figured I just read a review and let the people know the truth. The food was interesting and different. dogs at the table seem a bit weird to me, but I wont have to worry about that because I'm never going back!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant even if it wasn't dog friendly. Great large patio... there were a couple aggressive dogs over the few times we were there. Wish the place would Kindly ask them to leave before someone gets hurt... but other than that... perfect: great unbelievable service, really really great menu and food."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. Best way to describe my experience. Our server was nice but very slow. Especially for the first half of our meal. She had too many tables, at least 7 or 8. The drinks were pretty good. My wife got a Mojito which she enjoyed. I ordered the Salty Dog, Repasado Tequila and Grapefruit juice which I liked. 

We ordered the Queso appetizer. It had some nice spice from the jalapeños and chipotle. The cheese flavor was nice and bold. My issue with the dish we're the chips. They house made but they were underdone. That made them chewy and tough. The few that were golden brown were good, but they were few and far between. 

I got the Fried Chicken Sandwich. The meat was good, maybe just a little too thick for the sandwich. The brioche bun was fresh and flavorful but a bit too big. I thought the bread to sandwich ratio was too high. Nice spice from the fiery carrot slaw and jalapeños. Just really big and a bit tough to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We met Dr. Dre about a year ago, and have not stopped coming back to see her!  Always pleasant, quick, funny and makes your day better."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  We have driven past this place in the past and seen the crowds.  We went on the end of a three day holiday weekend and we were disappointed with the quality of the food.  Maybe their food delivery was off but the food tasted like it had been sitting around for a little.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite and very few restaurants where you can bring your dog too in Las Vegas. They have a lovely patio area with heaters and a fire pit to cozy up with your four legged friend. Lazy dog is always an enjoyable restaurant to eat delicious food. They have small plates for the light eater or hearty dishes like their tasty meatloaf if you are super hungry. Check in on yelp and you will receive a free order of their Cajun fries which are absolutely addicting and leave you wanting more!"}
{"text":"Love me some Lazy Dog! I have been there several times with family and friends. Always for lunch and dinner. I really want to try sunday brunch aka bottomless Mimosa's. I have ordered the Thai Noodles, Enchilada's, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Salmon, Spiral Pasta and of course starters like salad and the garlic flat bread. 

All dishes ordered have been delicious....except the spiral spaghetti/pasta. Didn't love that dish so much but it is listed as a house favorite so maybe it just wasn't my thing. I've actually ordered off of the kids menu as well, the chicken teriyaki/rice dish and the kids sundae which were both pretty tasty and more than enough food for a child or adult female. 

Ok, the drinks...Ive had the sangria trio, my favorite was the peach sangria. I've also had the pomegranate martini which was so yummy. 

In all I gave this place a 5 Star for the fact that the service is friendly, consistent and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for all occasions. I particularly like the happy hour menu but their menu overall has an option for everyone. And if for some reason you don't like what your order you can always count on the great staff to give you something different! Also, heads up, if you are in Chris' section, you are in great hands!"}
{"text":"You know, I like this place, I always have a good time here but whenever it comes to special requests, this place is not.... the best. As much as the waiter did a great job of submitting the order correctly but whoever makes the food.... didn't pay attention. A vegan asks for no cheese, she gets cheese  and an apology. Well I hope I have my reaction to dairy here before I go home. 

Seriously though. Not cool.


Oh and appetizers came out after the meal. Lol"}
{"text":"Awesomeness at its best. Love this place. Everything is great. The lazydog red beer is yummy.."}
{"text":"Lots of great beers on tap (I'm a fan of double and imperial IPA's).  Really good appetizers.  The bacon jalapeno mac n' cheese, lettuce wraps, roasted veggies, and poke jar were all wonderful.  The trout was old and not very good, so we sent it back, but they were very apologetic and adjusted the bill without issue.   Well-designed, modern-rustic decor; very nice, but still casual.  It might be a chain, but great job and we are happy to have them in-town and now on our regular go-to list."}
{"text":"My dogs love brunch w mommy they can eat with me in the outside patio and their own water & food dish ... they have rules food is ok"}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant with high expectation but left feeling disgusted. After asking the hostess if I could sit at the bar, I was excited to finally try out this restaurant. The bartender was attentive and asked what I wanted to drink. I came for brunch and order coffee and the Mediterranean omelet. After having my coffee which I enjoyed the expediter comes out with my omelet and a cockroach starts running across at the bar at where I was sitting. I ask the expediter if he could see the cockroach in front of me. He acted oblivious at first to what I was asking him and then I pointed to the roach, he then grabbed the roach with a napkin. I told him I was leaving and refused to pay for anything and left in disgust. Ten minutes later I decided to call and speak to a manager about the incident. He told me from my understanding that they had tried to spray for roaches early in that day and had their monthly spraying from their exterminator. So then I asked him \"how long has this problem been going on?\" He assured me that they don't have a cockroach problem. I find that hard to believe. What I do believe is they have a roach problem. Either recently or for awhile now and refuse to admit to the issue. He then offered me a $25 gift certificate for my next visit. I told him \"thank you but on all honesty I would probably never eat at your restaurant at all.\" Besides writing this review I'm debating whether to call the Southern Nevada Health District. This place should be shut down until they can fix their infestation problem."}
{"text":"First time at the Lazy Dog. The wait was about 15 to 20 minutes which we were okay with because it was a Sunday lunch after all. Once we were seated, it did take a while for us to be acknowledged by the waitress but she came and took our orders and the food came out quickly. I was impressed by the speed and thought my dish was phenomenal. After we got the food, we barely saw our waitress. I did have to ask some other member of the wait staff for a refill so that's where the -1 star comes in. I understand if your busy, but don't just pop back up with the check at the end. I will be back though. Of course. I enjoyed the food and can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The only think I could possibly complain about was the 30 min wait but we showed up at 3:30pm on Mother's Day so no real surprise that there was a wait & once we got seated it was worth it. My friend and I brought our dogs & we were seated on the covered patio which was perfect as it was hot out & they had fans going to cool us off. 

They brought water for the dogs quickly (oh yeah, water for us humans too) and pointed out the special menu they had for the dogs. Our dogs absolutely went to town on the chicken & rice so if they could type I'm sure their review would be good as well. 

Our food was delicious and perfect, my friend was raving about the fish tacos as I was stuffing my face with the chicken club sandwich that they made as a wrap for me. 

The service was just as good as the rest of it.  Our waiter (Brandon? I think? Sorry if you read this, I'm terrible with names) was great. Super friendly to both us humans and the dogs, brought more water when my dog rudely spilled his. 

Price was great as well, lunch for 2 humans & 2 dogs came to under $30. I will definitely be back, probably later this week"}
{"text":"Beer selection - 5 stars:  I feel like this place has a great selection of beers and cocktails. I suggest the lazy dog sampler. It's relatively cheap for the amount and variety you get. 

Food:  5 stars- I only ordered the chicken nachos and the turkey meatball appetizers but I really enjoyed what I ate. The meatballs were ok but the nachos were amazing. They were huge!  Feed three people and it was packed with ingredients like beans, chicken, quac, cheese and jalapeños. I highly recommend. 

Service: 3/4 stars. The first waitress we got wasn't that great. She didn't come around a lot and we had to flag her down. She said she was going on break and someone else was gonna take our table but I still saw her working while we had another waitress. Our second one was really awesome and friendly. We had a birthday in the group and she brought us free ice cream with a candle in it!  

Overall I definitely want to come back to this place especially for happy hour!  P.s. They are really strict about the hours because the computer automatically changes after 6pm ( when hh ends)"}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. The place is packed at all times. I like that you can bring your fur baby on the patio! The decor is like a cool log cabin. Reminds me of places you'd find in Northern California. Huge menu selection. You have to try the sangria sampler! They are all delicious! The hush puppies, the nachos, and Cajun fries appetizers are yummy. The pot roast is good but the mashed potatoes taste like box potatoes:( I don't like the poblano chicken it's bland no spice to it. My favorite entrée is the ginger salmon. For dessert, the crumble dessert, key lime cheesecake and smores are really good. My favorite dessert is the warm butter cake. Now that I have been here a few times I know exactly what I like and what my dog Sadie likes now."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary for brunch was perfect. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and the wedge salad. The salad was great. I was really excited for the tortilla soup but by the time I got to it, all the chips were soggy and the soup wasn't so good anymore. I would have liked more soup and less tortilla strips."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with a friend and the place was packed!! Sat at the bar and had a great meal. Terri was our bartender Nd she's great!! I had full BBQ back ribs and I was a huge portion n so delicious! My friend had Blue Butter NY Steak n it rocks! No wonder they get so busy. I loved it n I'll be coming back once a week for sure."}
{"text":"We love eating here...especially on the weekends during their brunch hours.   

The food is great, the drinks are great, and we always have awesome service here.  I would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you have little puppies to bring!"}
{"text":"A great dinner choice with a surprisingly varied menu- salads, pastas, chicken, fish etc. A good choice of starters and a full bar. The coconut mojito was excellent and the fresh watermelon margarita was a close second.  Had the hummus trio followed by lemon caper chicken and the TexMex salad.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Lazy dogs is now one of our favorite restaurants very family friendly. The food is amazing. The service is the best in Vegas. Christi is easily one of the best servers we have ever had. Thanks Chianti for the wonderful service"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place to have a meal. My family and I went to this restaurant for the first time as we had not had a chance to try the one at Downtown Summerlin. It turned out to be pretty good. The service was fast and good. The food was pretty good. I had their chicken fingers and enjoyed them. They were a little different and you could tell they were made in house and fresh. My family also enjoyed their meals. Everyone was very happy with the service and we plan to come back. I would highly recommend for a nice meal while at Town Square."}
{"text":"This place was actually really amazing! Third times a charm to come in. I've been try to eat here for 3 months and there is ALWAYS a two hour wait. Me and my best friend snagged a seat at the bar and were accommodated by the bartender Adam. He was very intelligent, knowledgable, and very accommodating. My water was literally filled right as soon as it was empty. 5/5 service that's for sure.

For their drink prices, they are soooo reasonable and delicious. I tried their Moscow mule (yum), blueberry margarita, cucumber martini, and the sangria sampler. Everything was spot on and perfect. As for our food, it came out so fast and their portions were huge! We ordered off the happy hour menu their hush puppies, ahi, Cajun fries, and cheese quesadilla. Everything was cooked to perfection, I was literally so full and regretting everything I ate hahahah. Such amazing food and service! Will be back again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Jennifer B was awesome as our server... our first time here. I am a local and my cousin was visiting from Cleveland Ohio had a difficult time trying to determine where we were going to eat we are so glad we chose this establishment. Also Kristin (in training) and Michelle the manager were awesome with the Customer Service....simply the best. We will be back"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, the staff was knowledgeable and helpful regarding obscure allergies, and they were child friendly. Our server, Mason, was particularly awesome with our finicky and tired eight year old. We will definitely eat here again! Thank you, Mason and staff!"}
{"text":"What a surprise!!  We ate at Fleming's the night before and saw this place and went on a whim.  This is not a 5-Star restaurant outside of the fact they have GREAT down-home cooking, good service. and everything else I like about a restaurant in Vegas (large windows, large tables, friendly staff, quick service, clean grounds).

One of their specialties is the Chicken Pot Pie which they create from scratch daily.  I didn't order it but instead chose the Pretzel Breaded Schnitzel.  While my pork schnitzel was good, the two bites of my daughters Pot Pie made my night.  It's VERY GOOD!!!!!

Small but decent wine selection plus great food and service.  A comfortable dining room with plenty of light and an Outdoorsy feel.  Think Applebee's only MUCH better.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Today was one of those \"Im hungry and don't want to cook a big meal nights so lets check out the happy hour\" days. Mondays are hard enough! lol.

 Today had some errands to run at downtown Summerlin ( returns ) and so we decided to check out one of many restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. Funny thing is out of all the ones we have not tried yet, this was our choice as we have been repeat diners here. Bring your furry friend for outdoor patio seating. 

Happy Hour is where it is! We ordered a plate of Nachos, some Mac N Cheese and i saw \"Fire fried rice\" so i just had to try it. The Nachos are HUGE! Repeat, HUGE. Had we known they were that big, we would not have ordered the other stuff.

 We ended up taking enough leftovers home for a whole other meal. The rice was just as depicted plus it had a nice sunny side up egg sitting right on top!  A little Sriracha and we are off to the races! The Mac n Cheese was awesome as were the Nachos. The rice is a must try!

Well, we decided to save money and just order water but the beer selection was just to tempting not to try. A pale ale for the wife and a Hefewiezen  for yours truly. All of that and we got out for under 27 bucks. 

There are plenty of servers and the service is top notch here. They are on their \"A\" game here. I love the rustic lodge decor depicted. 

As for the story of Lazy Dogs ..... Read Below .... I love Jackson Hole!

Growing up, Chris and his family would vacation in the breathtaking mountains of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Whether it was skiing in the winter or fishing in the summer, Chris will tell you that even today it is the place he goes when he wants to get away and relax. 

When you are in any one of the Lazy Dog restaurants, you will see how Chris has tried to capture and recreate the feeling he gets when in Jackson Hole. He wants you to feel like you are walking into a place that is the perfect balance of warm and comfortable, yet full of excitement and positive energy. 

For Chris, the lodge represents vacations with family and friends. Jackson Hole is a small town with a true sense of hospitality. Get your car stuck in the snow, and the next person who passes by will stop to help. Most likely, they'll even know your name.

Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that \"lazy dog' by the fire.

On their last run down the ski slopes in Jackson Hole, everyone has one thing on their mind: get these skis off and head to the lodge. Whether you're sitting by the fire or bellying up to the bar, the servers and bartenders know what you like and treat you like you're one of the family. The lodge has cold beer, hot chocolate, incredible food and great music, making it the place to be in town. 

Just like the lodge in Jackson Hole, the Lazy Dog offers the perfect environment for all ages, making the entire restaurant the place to be for a quick dinner with the family, a meandering meal with friends or a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Great service hands down!! The watermelon margarita that I had was amazing!!!! Very refreshing and made to perfection. The cajun fries were ok, I kind of expected more mentally but they were still good...don't get me wrong. The just had a bacon cheeseburger this time around but it was really good. The burger itself was perfectly prepared and seasoned. I will definitely be returning. I thought the whole setup was really nice and fitting for any kind of outing."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/brunch. Everything was perfect. I had a party of seven so I made a reservation the afternoon before but it really wasn't needed. We got there at 10 and there were lots of tables available. The service was great, and everyone was happy with their food. Our server was Nicole and she was awesome. My family can't wait to go back during the summer so we can bring the pups and eat outside."}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful place! A huge, partially enclosed, heated patio area and great food. I recommend the Cajun fries and Ahi Tuna. Brook the manager was so good to us, just an excellent lady!! Cheers!!~"}
{"text":"Had tomato basil soup and grilled cheese lunch combo. It was so yummy. Soup nice creamy seasoned good. Grilled cheese was delicious, I'm picky about cheese and this had good quality tasting cheese. 
They have a pretty decent Meir, but a week of traveling, eating, drinking this is what my belly was craving and it hit the spot. 
I tried their Moscow Mule and it was great. Sometimes they are a hit or miss with flavor to me and this is one my favs I have tried. 
Waitress was quick, accurate and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and love the atmosphere. The staff was wonderful. Will be coming back real soon with the family."}
{"text":"One of the few places one can go to dine with their furry best friends. The service is always friendly and tolerant of those dogs whom are not the best behaved, which itself demonstrates great patience on their part. The menu is largely quite good, though a bit too long diverse to really focus on excellence. Nevertheless it is a relaxing, quality place in a very unfriendly city for dog owners."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. First time the service struggled a bit, but has continually improved on each visit. I love visiting in the warmer months with my pugs :) They love the chicken and rice bowl here. I have found that I love the lavash (vegetarian) and this can easily be made vegan. It's light but filling at the same time. Drinks are also good."}
{"text":"Beer: Excellent. 
Food: Very good. 
Service: Very good. 
Prices: Excellent. 

This is the best place we've been to in the mall so far. They also have way better prices for just as good food around the mall. 

I had the Chicken Poblano. Excellent. Especially the sauce. It has a lot of spices in it, so your nose must be prepared. 

Another tip: the stick ribs are good, but beware. This is more of the Asian style BBQ sauce, not Hawaiian. But, they were still good.

There's not much else I feel like I need to say. I would love to bring my dog here and let him gaze upon the mall from the patio."}
{"text":"I love Lazy Dog and especially the Summerlin location. The  food is great! My favorite is the calamari nobody does it better but I especially like the staff. Jeremy is always there to greet us with a friendly smile. Great job!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Lazy Dog!! I have been going to Lazy Dog for years in California and I can not contain my excitement that it is here in Vegas!! My chicken Alfredo was so yummy!! My flat bread was pure perfection!! The service was on point thanks so our awesome server Fin!! The drive from the East Side of Vegas so worth it!! Next time we go we are bringing our dogs along!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  My daughter and I took our Chaweenie for lunch. She was excited and enjoyed an entree off of the \"doggie menu\". Portions were large (people menu) and I recommend sharing. The patio was clean and the wait staff friendly. I was impressed when they declined to seat a rambunctious (out of control) dog that arrived, ensuring the rest of the diners were not interrupted.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Where to begin..

The server was overwhelmed and it looked like she wanted to cry..
Please put another server outside and stop overworking this girl with too many tables, she can't tend to her customers!!!
She forgot to put in the order for the Cajun Fries BUT she said it went to another table.. (?)
We ended up getting our dessert first and we finished that 5 minutes before the dessert came..
The sangria was not like how it used to be and it was super watered down..even after I asked for them to go light on the ice, the ice was half the pitcher..not worth the money if you ask me..


What's the hype, Vegas? Why is this place so popular???"}
{"text":"Ronnie was the best waitress hands down here this busy Friday night! The food was amazing! Ronnie help us with drink selections and her suggestions were spot on. Will be back."}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant, I look for consistency. And this place has been consistently great. I love this restaurant because it's so comforting, food is delicious and the vibe is always on point. It is not your typical stuffy Summerlin restaurant at all. It has all your favorite comfort foods AND you get to bring your furbabies. Although I personally have never brought my furbaby here, I do enjoy seeing all the four legged babies hanging out with their family. 

I truly enjoy their outside patio. They have this huge fire pit and if you're sitting next to it, you don't even realize that it might my a cold windy Vegas night- because you're warm by the fire! I absolutely love it. 

Every time I go I have to indulge in their amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup with avocados. They pair it with this cheese pita cracker that really hits the spot! Perfect. I crave this soup and I always order this. My husband likes to get a little bit of everything when we come here- and the flavors are so great!

**just a side note, be prepared to wait a little longer when they are busy. Service is nice, but we do end up waiting a little longer then usual when there is a game on.

All in all, I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is out of control good. My recommendation would be to skip the meal and go right for dessert. The butter cake and fudge brownie will change your life."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years and the happy hour is amazing! The bloody Mary's are also great and you can always bring your dogs and eat on the patio!"}
{"text":"I always go here with my dog because it's so yummy and unique! (This location is in Downtown summerlin!) They have amazing and fast services and also have a outside patio just for your furry friends! There's also a big bonfire outside and heaters if you do decide to dine outside. This place has a nice dining experience in a very easy and relaxing atmosphere. 

They have amazing staff services, our server was super knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us feedbacks and opinions on certain dishes and he was always ready to answer any questions. The only complaint i have was when i was first inside, 2 host didn't realize that i had gotten there first and seated someone else before me because they weren't looking, so tip just make sure you flag them down constantly. But that's the only complaint i have because the rest of the other workers were so sweet and helpful. Clean place (with adorable dog deco) & environment with a beautiful scenery. The food also came our fast and yummy!! 

Tips: (w. your furry ones) 
-You're not allowed to have your pup on your lap or chair so they must be on the floor 
-Staffs can't pet your dog 
-There's menu options for your pup & waterbowls!
-You can't share with your pup 
-They have to be on leashes

The food was high quality and delicious! I was here for the happy menu this time (for this review purpose only w/ pictures) i got the chicken wings, the carbonara pasta, the sweet potato tator tots, and Banana pudding. The food was so good and comforting!

Chicken Wings: (Happy menu) 5 pieces per order ; juicy chicken wings with bbq and spicy flavor, creamy ranch and celery sticks 

Carbonara pasta: Had bacon, sweet peas, garlic, romano, poached egg, chardonnay cream sauce! (With cheese chips) This was so creamy flavorful, and all the ingredients really balanced out with each other. 

Banana Pudding: It was a HOMEMADE banana pudding, with banana slices, whip creams and vanilla nilla wafers! The pudding had a rich creamy and thick constancy with layers of banana slices and wafers

Sweet potato tator tots: 
Super crispy and sweet, with homemade lime jalapeño aioli

I recommend trying this place when you're in the area or just ever want to spoil yourself and your pup with amazing dining!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and comfy little neighborhood restaurant! We searched for dog friendly places and discovered LD and just called ahead to find out more info and got into the outdoor patio. When you want to dine and bring your dog along, this is the perfect place, as it seems all your other choices are usually like simpler fast food or diner type places.  This place is slightly more upscale, and the dogs are super encouraged as well as fed there if you want to order for them and a part of the whole gimmick of course. There were lots of other dogs there, about 10 or so, and lots of patio seating.  The food was really terrific, reasonable priced, great service, and we are big fans now!"}
{"text":"I love this place, used to come all the time with my dogs until I moved.  The only thing I would change is to broaden the salad list, but that is such a minor thing for such a huge menu.  The dogs loved both the Henderson and Summerlin locations."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great location and good vibes. Bring your dogs for the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times since they've opened up and this is still a strong recommend. The food has the sort of flavor that keeps wanting to eat more despite how full you are. This is not a trait to take lately people. Flavor is everything. So many restaurants out an emphasis on entrees and forget appetizers. Not here!  These guys make sure all their tummies, are yummy. 

Drinks are generous and they don't skimp on the spirits which is important in this \"increase those margin\" society we live in. Their microbrews are super awesome and I especially dig their IPA. If you are into the IPA's then make your way over to this one cause it's good. I've had people who aren't fans of IPA's tell me how much they like it. Fortunately I'm already a fan and this one moved to my top tier. 

Now let's close with service. Lazy Dog staff are friendly and accommodating. I think they either have a 4-year college degree requirement or they just plain hire intelligent folks. I'm no snob (well maybe a little), but I like a server who understands the world around them. I see this here and it's been consistent. 

So why 4 stars and not 5?  Too new. I need to see this be consistent into the next year.  But I'm pretty certain they'll get it from me. They have the right ingredients to make it happen (pun intended). I'll just keep going there and I know they won't let me down."}
{"text":"Everything we wanted and more! Carlos our waiter was awesome! And we didn't even know this beforehand, but they have our absolute favorite dessert ever...the Butter Cake!! To die for!! Love that the menu has so many different options for drinks and food. My boyfriend and I came here for a nice mellow date night and it was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Music wasn't too loud and not a single issue with my dog being there."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Great hospitality!!! Waitress ( Alissa) was very attentive and friendly, took the time to explain to us the  menu and a little bit of the restaurants history. Her recommendations were on point. Tony the Manager was excellent in greeting us , being that this was our first visit ( not the last one for sure). Accommodated us with a House favorite Garlic chips.... looking forward to our next visit! Very impressed!!!! 
Mahalo Lazy Dog, you guys got it right!"}
{"text":"It has legit been 3 years since I've gone back to this place and I'm happy to say that it's still a solid 4 stars.

We stopped in as a party of 3- T, myself and the dog, after a morning up at Calico Basin. We were hungry, sweaty, probably a little smelly and definitely dirty. Seated on the patio, our hostess was super sweet! We were given menus and our waitress immediately popped over and asked for our drink order. I needed more time with the menu and I'm grateful she obliged. I had a hard time making up my mind. 

T got the hamburger and fries. DANG is that thing huge. I can't believe it's a kid's burger. It's the same size as an adult. Don't EVER change that portion size, please and thank you!! Kids tend to have crazy big appetites. I have a growing boy. He housed that thing down, along with all the fries. I ordered the blackened chicken bowl sans dairy. It was decent and I was satisfied after.

Obvious perk is that it's insanely dog friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of my favorites in Vegas. The service and staff is amazing, and I'm always more than excited to come back for more.  Finn made this evening even more special by providing my husband and I excellent one of a kind service.  Even though she had her station of customers she made us feel like her only table and took the time to get to know us and our likes and needs for what's on the menu.  We left not only satisfied by a wonderful dinner but we left knowing we have made a new friend because of how wonderful Finn's service was.  She even made sure to use our names as she waived good bye to us.  Highly recommend this restaurant and want to say thank you to Finn for making our date night even more special."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and great ambiance for casual dining. If you are not a dog person this place is kept very clean. Go when the temperature is right as the outdoor patio is the place to sit. Great fire pit if needing a drink by the fire."}
{"text":"Anna was fantastic, talked us through the brunch menu and recommended some great sangria! Made our dog feel special on her v important second birthday! Super fun experience!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here after seeing a movie. I ordered a burger with a red ale, nothing fancy, just simple. I got sick from my meal. I'll probably be up all night getting sick from whatever was in the food I ate. To make matters worse, it happened a few hours before our flight home so I'll have to hold it together long enough to get home on the plane without getting sick. Thanks a lot, Lazy Dog! Your food and what it did to me is the perfect way to end this trip."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever dined at. I am not one to assume someone is being racist or profiling, but based on all of the information at hand -- that was the case today. 

I came in for a quick lunch after an appointment at PROJECT (tradeshow at Mandalay Bay five minutes away) based off of a coworker's suggestion. So I always have to give props where they are due -- the host was very nice and friendly. She seated me and made genuine small talk. After that, it all went to hell. 

I sat for 10 minutes and had to flag someone down to take my order. Please keep in mind it's the afternoon and not busy at all. Then I was told my server was training someone -- ok, great? But I still need service. So I tell the gentleman I flag down I'm ready to place my order and he says he can only write it down and pass it to my \"actual\" server -- Candace. So I see him walk over to Candace to hand her my order, he points to me (as he should so she can know where her customer is) and she makes a face of annoyance. At this point, she still hasn't come over to talk to me and I see her being friendly to everyone else in the section except for me. 

My drink finally comes over, and it's the server shadowing her who brings it over. Then my food comes out, the guy just drops it off and goes. It's actually the wrong bowl, but with how service has been -- I won't send it back and I'm hungry. So I start eating the food, it's of course not good. Candace (my actual server) still hasn't come by to ask how's it going, is the food good, nothing at all! 

At this point, I'm ready to go and flag down the server in training to grab me my check. She has to ask Candace to print the check. Finally! Candace walks over to my table. And she doesn't say hi, bye, cat, dog, how was it?....not a word. She simply drops it and goes. It's at this point where I'm fed up and can tell she has something against me and we've never met, so it must be that she has profiled me as a black woman and thinks something ignorant like I won't tip her -- so why do her actual job. So mean and cruel in 2018. 

I ask the server in training can I speak to someone. She brings over the manager, Jose. He is actually nice and even says he understands. Because he too is a person of color. He asks to take care of the meal. But I let him know it's not about the money, it's about the treatment. Regardless, I would've paid and tipped. It was actually a work lunch I could've expensed it and her tip was guaranteed. Even if it weren't a work lunch, I would've still tipped her. So to treat me in such a poor manner because of blatant profiling was sad more than anything else. 

It is 2018 Candace, don't be racist. It's not nice. You shouldn't treat people differently than everyone else because of their skin color or preconceived notions. There is no reason for that. 

Even though you were rude to me, I hope the Universe touches your mean spirit and allows you to be a better person. The year just started, you have time."}
{"text":"As a local, I LOVE coming to Lazy Dog. They've got a great Happy Hour and great house beer selection. The staff is friendly and attentive - especially the bartenders Drea and TL. They remember my name and what I like to drink. 

Food wise, you can't go wrong. I love the wok-fired chicken, the black and bleu pizza, and burgers are great too. 

They combine the charm of a local place with the flavor of really good food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great menu selections and the coconut Mojito rocks.

Nice patio which welcomes your dogs.. 

Inside is very much like BJ's restaurant.

Everything from burgers to tacos to pizza.."}
{"text":"We have been to Lazy Dog 7 separate times and have had nothing but great experiences. We normally bring our golden retriever and sit on the patio but we have also sat inside and at the bar as well. My wife almost always gets the same two menu items, depending on it being brunch or dinner, but I have tried something different every time we have been. We have yet to have a bad meal or service. We most recently went for Easter Sunday, 04-16-17, and were the first customers on the patio at 830am. As we were getting our child out of the back seat, our playful golden retriever got loose in the parking lot and ran over to a Lazy Dog worker who looked like he was bringing coffees in for his coworkers. He was great with our dog and greeted us as well. The host person sat us at our patio table and our server ended up being the same person we met in the parking lot! His name was Timijen and he was fantastic. My wife had the brunch berry pancake, our son had buttermilk bone cakes, I had the Mediterranean omelet, and our pup had some scrambled eggs. The prices for the quality of food are excellent and we look forward to seeing Tim and the rest of the Lazy Dog staff at the Downtown Summerlin location again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. So many mouth watering options. Jacob Lozano aka JLo was incredibly nice, super upbeat and knowledgeable of the food. Great vibes and personality that made our experience even greater. Great food, great people. Will definitely be back :) !"}
{"text":"The first time my friends and I came here we just had appetizers and drinks. We had the chicken wings, loaded potato hush puppies, sweet potato tots (love the spicy aoli), trio of hummus (love the pesto one), and a butter cake (we get this every time now). Also, the specialty lemonade/cooler drinks were delicious but cost $1 for each refill while sodas have free refills. Otherwise it was great. We've gone back a few times and love their happy hour too. Love it all and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Great place! Perfect lunch sizes and fair priced, service is wonderful. I haven't had the chance to bring my dog with me over here since its a pet friendly place ( outdoors of course) but I will,  one of these days. I love the shrimp tacos, but they have a wide range of favorites to choose from on their menu. Aaah! Beautiful bar and a perfect place just to chill with friends after work or just a quick bite to eat for lunch. Try the happy hour too, which I believe starts around 3 pm. Not only good for chow but excellent to watch and catch up with some games ( sports ) while eating. I will certainly come back here . And I do recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Great place to take your dog to if you need to be out of the house for a few hours. Food is pretty good. Service is a bit lax, so don't go if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"It's a lively place with a great vibe! Excellent bar menu and food choices to keep you coming back to try more. Servers are attentive and the prices moderate for the area. Great customer service with Managers that greet you at the table and care about your experience 
Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I recently took my best girlfriend who had been recovering from surgery and had been itching to finally get out of her house.  so we had planned on having lunch at lazy dogs, our server Amy was so accommodating & helpful, had us laughing right from the start.  She took such good care of the two of us,  I ordered the chicken Spanish salad and a couple glasses of wine. And French fry's for my little Geisha, that's the greatest thing to be able to have lunch with ur pup & bestie.  Amy suggested the portobello burger for Lisa who happens to be a vegetarian. She loved it.  And we finished it up with the desert butter cake,  over all it was a such a perfect way to spend lunch and the our afternoon.  Next time I'll have a puppy party and invite all the girls."}
{"text":"Beer good

Appetizer ok, need more than the ten chips that we got with the spinach/tomato cheese dip

Burger ok

Service meh, had to ask 3 times for glasses of water. Finally got them after dinner.

Nothing special, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The mac and cheese is the best ever. The chicken quesadilla is delish. The pulled pork sandwich is yummy. Everything we've had has been wonderful! They have a great happy hour and the sangria is not only tasty but served in a large glass. The decor is adorable. They have vegetarian friendly options as well."}
{"text":"Food is good patio smells like pee.  It is funny to see people who normally don't care about their dogs bring their dog to the restaurant because they can"}
{"text":"Our server ty made our experience AMAZING. Definitely can taste the quality of the food from the scratch kitchen!  To top of our amazing experience with great hospitality! Our favorite spot for drinks, food, and fun! Definitely going to be coming back and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Our server Sergio made our experience nothing but pleasant. He was very patient with us and very attentive."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this spot out. my husband and I were looking for something new in town square. We decided to give lazy dogs a try.  The hostess was accommodating to sit us in a spot we could keep the stroller. We were seated in ten minutes. The manager came over to greet us and take our drink order but when the server came we had to repeat it to him. We checked in on yelp and got free Cajun fries! they came out hot and fresh! Drinks came out  quickly! Brandon took our order, he was really nice and easy. But as the night progressed service got really slow. Food took over 40 minutes to reach out table. it was obvious  I guess the kitchen got in the weeds and the server seemed a little frazzled. Took awhile to get our second round of drinks. The baby was restless.

I got a tex Mex salad and my husband got a BBQ burger. The food was good. portions are large. It took forever to get our check anod my husband and the baby were loosing patience. At the end they charged us for the Cajun fries but I mentioned it to the server and he corrected it. But then it took some more time to get it corrected.

Overall, it was a fair experience. Would not go there for a quick bite but if you have the time and patience."}
{"text":"Great sports type bar and restaurant near the strip.  Checked in and had the Cajun fries with dip that was great.  Unique menu with interesting flavors to try.  Really enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"our server Alejandro was amazing!!! He was so funny and had us laughing the whole time. he was hands down the best server I have ever had! oh and the brownie ice cream dessert deserves an A+"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best experiences I've had at a Lazy dogs resturant before. Came here with friends and 3 dogs. Sometimes it can get a little crazy with 3 dogs but our server reassured us that they were acting great. Our server was Laura! She was amazing! We ended up staying a little later than we planned, but that was because it was slow and Laura spent some time with us chatting and getting to know us. Which in turn, we ended up ordering more food and drinks. She had my attention at Horses. We talked for awhile about different Horse breeds, saddles, and trails to enjoy. She mentioned one of her coworkers also loves horses too, and can't stop talking about horses. Haha! She was very attentive and the food was amazing! We ordered the hummus, Cajun fries, quesadilla, buffalo pops, chips, and nachos. Of course we had various drinks on the happy hour menu as well. We will be back for sure to enjoy the great food and specials!"}
{"text":"Seems like the management team just doesn't care when they get busy. I forgot my receipt and came bk and they made me wait for over an hour and the employees said it took so long because the manager Brooke was too busy and was the only manager and wasnt allowed to leave her spot to help me. Other than that the place was nice but that was so much of a bummer I cant leave a good review."}
{"text":"This was a very satisfying eating experience where everything we and our friends ordered looked and tasted great. I was afraid it was going to be some applebees knock-off with higher prices, but the food was genuinely good. 

I had the pork shoulder, and it was good, but probably every other dish was even better. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best customer service I've ever experienced here in Vegas! Not only the food was amazing but also the staff! 
Jennifer our server was outstanding! Also Phil and Jose (the managers) who were the cherry on top of my sundae! 
Thank you again for an incredible time!

{"text":"Alright, 2nd time ordering with them through DinerDash and still 5 stars!! My husband ordered the same pizza and this time I ordered the fish and chips. I must say, the fish and chips is probably my favorite item from there so far. My husband also got the white chocolate pretzel cheesecake (I was trying to take a picture before my husband got his hands on it, but he beat me to it - obviously it was delicious lol) and we also ordered the white chocolate brownie which was still so good."}
{"text":"The Mister had a hankering to give Lazy Dog a try, so off we went! We came in on a Sunday night around 8PM and were sat at a table immediately. Surprisingly enough, Lazy Dog closes at midnight on a Sunday. Crazy, I know! 

BAJA CALIFORNIA BURGER ($10.95): Any burger patty can be substituted with a vegetarian Gardenburger! The burger was huge and messy. So messy in fact, that I had to get all European and eat my burger with a fork and knife. Keeping it classy. Taste wise, the burger was just alright. I wouldn't order a burger again. Thankfully, there's sooo many other veg options to choose from at Lazy Dog! There's a tofu wok dish, Thai noodles with tofu, grilled cheese, and lavash tacos to name a few choices. The vegetarian friendly menu is one of the reasons I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. 3/5  

HAWAIIAN STICKY RIBS ($15.95): Husband really liked the ribs, thought the Asian slaw was meh, and ate every single unami fry on the plate. 4/5

WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP BROWNIE ($5.95): Presentation was kind of weird (fudge smear looked like a poop smear lol) and it tasted like the boxed brownies I make at home. 2.5/5  

SERVICE: Our waiter was on his a-game. He got us refills without having to ask and was so damn proper! 5/5

VIBE: Pretty crowded and kinda loud. I was confused on the theme. There were paw prints on the table and Americana decor and license plates on the wall. Is it Western? The vibe reminded me of Claim Jumper, but not as hunter-ish. 3/5 

PRO TIP: 10% discount for military! Wooooo

Worth a Return Visit?
The Happy Hour deals seem great, so I'll definitely be back for that! Late Night HH is 9-close Sunday through Thursday at the bar and patio. $3 drafts and plenty of cheap apps too

{"text":"Food is amazing and is fairly priced. Unfortunately, the service is horrible. The staff is extremely rude and the restaurant moves at a slow place. Be prepared for bad service once you walk into the door."}
{"text":"I went in the soft opening and did not have enough nice things to say.  I've since gone again and again.  This place is legit! I love the pastas and salads. The beer that they make is amazing.  My husband is rather well versed in beer (I know how cliche that sounds these days), but he too was impressed with the quality of their drafts and the glass cleaning system they use (apparently it's a big deal). I love the patio and the fire pit.  The service is amazing no matter where you choose to sit.  

*I had to laugh at the knuckle head who yelped, \"I do not go out to see dogs on patios.\" Lol, I guess the name \"Lazy Dog\" did not give the fact away that it's a dog friendly establishment, but perhaps the bone door handles, the decorative fire hydrant, the dog menu...  You dress some people up, but you just can't take them out.   Haha.  I for one am glad there is ONE place people can bring their dogs.  I enjoyed seeing all the customers' happy pooches. I don't go to chuckie cheese and complain about kids, just sayin!"}
{"text":"Food was good to great. Service was horrible, then now going over my bank account, they jacked their tip up over what I gave.  Bad service to dishonest. Stay away, the food wasn't that good to be cheated."}
{"text":"Wish we had tried this place sooner! The service, food and atmosphere were great. Loved the outdoor dog-friendly patio seating. They have a decent lunch menu and although we weren't drinking today I took a look at the drink menu and it looks pretty awesome. They have a few sangrias and even do a sampler. Same for beer maybe? Desserts looked good too. Food came out in good time. The dog loved her chicken and rice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Management Please Take Into Consideration

I've eaten here twice and still the same horrible service. Such a great place with such GREAT FOOD but service/training is lacking.

I took my dog with me to go eat, hearing that they serve food for dogs as well. But I had to wait a good 15 minutes just to be asked for drinks. With that time I already knew what to order. I ordered the chicken Alfredo and chicken with rice for my dog. The food came out Perfect, I just needed something to drink when they gave me the food. I had to ask three times just to get water during my meal,and the moment I got water was when i was getting ready to head out; Meal done,bill payed for and signed.
On top of that there was a big misunderstanding with other tables getting wrong checks (easily could of been a train wreck if those checks were charged wrong).
Also, I believe more attention should be given to the patio.

These small mishaps can really make or break a dining experience. Sadly, it broke my experience."}
{"text":"I only come here for my dog... I find the service is always slow and the food is adequate. Nothing special, unless you have four legs and say WOOF."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Yummy food and drinks. Nice outdoor patio area. Fun atmosphere with the pups. The servers forgot a few things here and there but we're attentive. Just had to ask again for a few things."}
{"text":"Horrible service here. We came in to try this place out and there was no hostess at the desk. We waited there for several minutes and no one came. Finally we flagged down a server from the bar and she told us we could sit anywhere in the bar if we wanted. So we sat down at an empty table. There were several tables in the bar that were not bussed because the busser was too busy talking to someone. We waited there for someone to bring us menus and take our drink orders but no one ever came. Eventually the server who told us to sit in the bar area came with menus, but she gave them to the people sitting next to us who arrived there after we did. Then she brought ours. We decided to leave. I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Our kitchen and restaurant away from home, especially at the bar with Dre! Dre makes us feel at home and is the most personable bartender in the business. Not only does she make you feel at home, but her menu knowledge is incredible. We love the wings, and high altitude sauce on the side.  We also love their extensive menu with a little taste of everything. Our home away from home is Lazy Dog for sure!"}
{"text":"5 Star taste / blue collar portions / on a budget prices / excellent drink menu

I ate here twice while in Las Vas during a five day military TDY.

Great food! The road carrots (seasonal item I think) were amazing! The food was very good... and you receive large portions.

It's open until Midnight so I didn't have to rush to get there after I got off at 8Pm and I did't have to rush to eat my dinner.

Their beer selection was Awesome and happy hour prices were very cheap!

My wife and I shared the carrots, I got a pizza and my wife got the green Chile nachos.  We both had leftovers and enjoyed our meals.

My wife drank cocktails, one she liked, one she didn't.

Definitely my favorite Las Vegas restaurant!"}
{"text":"Cool brunch spot, the food was AMAZING. Can't go wrong with $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"LAZY MAN! FIRST IMPRESSION REWARD.

My first impression was this was some kinda dog people bar style weirdo menu place BUT... this place was more than that. The feng shui was on point, now lets get to it!

CAJUN FRIES: they were very good the seasoning was a bit much nut the flavor was there and the dipping sauce was a good match!

TORTILLA SOUP: This was surprisingly one of my favorite soups that I've had in a while, it had lots of flavor really enjoyable!

MY MEAL CHICKEN PARM WITH NOODLES (Don't know actual name sorry): I don't have any thing bad to say because I actually enjoyed this dish but it wasn't something I'd order again. The chicken was cooked good, the noodles I didn't like so much maybe because I was expecting more like spaghetti style but no matter it all got ate for leftovers! 

Overall this was an awesome experience and I love the environment I felt really comfortable keep up the good work lazy people!"}
{"text":"Great new place, awesome food all around from starters to entrees.  Insane drink selection, try the hush puppies, fish tacos, it's all very good.  Staff was awesome, best all around restaurant I've been to in a long time.  Oh, prices very reasonable.  I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Upon browsing Yelp for approximately half an hour in the car, my friends and I decided to come to here since we were craving cheesy, American food, particularly grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese. We arrived around nine in the evening on a Thursday and the restaurant was lively! Not packed but not uncomfortably empty either. There's happy hour if you sit on the patio (WHERE DOGS ARE ALLOWED) or bar area at designated times. We ordered primarily from the happy hour menu which included hush puppies, macaroni and cheese, buffalo chicken lollipops, and turkey meatballs. In addition, my friend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of cajun fries. Everything was a decent portion and satisfied our stomachs. We also ordered banana pudding for dessert and a white chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream to share. Despite the meal being on point, our server made the experience 10/10! Dominic was knowledgeable and honest about the menu items, giving us recommendations and letting us know that there was bleu cheese in certain dishes (since not many people are a fan). We will definitely be back for our weekly happy hour friend dates but next time we'll bring our puppers!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday for a brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. Since the weather was great we decided to eat at the patio. If you have a dog you can bring them in at the patio too. 

We ordered the breakfast pizza, omelet, and they berry pancakes. The breakfast pizza was great but a bit too over cooked on the crust. It was slightly tough to chew the crust but the sunny side up eggs was a great addition. The omelet was good but nothing extraordinary. But man o man the pancake was amazing. First off, two people could share it. It taste amazing when it first comes out and the whipped cream was light! I didn't feel the need to add the syrup but it is available if one does need it.

For our party of three all that cost about 35$ which is a steal! The portions were amazingly hearty and the prices were low! I just found a new favorite brunch place! I will definitely come back to try their lunch and dinner menu too!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come here, and the visit was very pleasant. The ambience is super big. The ceiling height is very, very tall, as are the windows. It makes you feel small, yet the color choices make it warm. Every single staff men ever greeted us warmly and made it a very relaxing visit. My friends and I were looking forward to their cocktails- I ordered the pineapple mojito, and my friends ordered the white peach sangria. Our waitress was wonderful, I wish I remembered her name, and she asked us what we should take as recommendations, after we had given her an idea of what we wanted to drink. The menu itself was good- enough choices without being overwhelming, but the combinations were very different. I'm all about fusions, but it made it very perplexing to find what we wanted to eat. Again, our waitress came to the rescue. She recommended the fish and chips (perfectly moist, not greasy, and very flaky) my friend ordered the California burger (she said it was good, but nothing special) and my other friend ordered the ahi tuna salad (light flavorful, and the fish was lovely seared). The food was yummy, and the cocktails strong yet very pleasant. While every box was checked, it left us saying, it was good but not great. Still a good bite and experience."}
{"text":"\"Middle age is when you get excited about different flavored Hummus\". Guess I'm there. The hummus trio was excellent, the pesto flavor was the best. Very nice outdoor seating that is puppy friendly! Veggie lavash sandwich is just ok. Service was nice,  water refills on point. Will be back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile now. Whenever we have family in town and we don't feel like wrestling with the strip we come here.  The food has always been great and we love Christine as our server. She is awesome! Super attentive and friendly. She has been the first server in Vegas to actually impress me for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to eat with my friend.

This place is super good!
We got the pizza and burgers and the wings.
Everything's taste made to order .
Will be back!!!
Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this restaurant. I love furry friends and I appreciate that Lazy Dog welcomes them on the patio. That way, you won't have to be separated! 

My friends and I came here this past Sunday for brunch. We had just finished the Breast Cancer Walk so we were pretty tired and hungry. There is a yelp check in offer for cajun fries .. if you're lucky enough to see it pop up on your yelp app. It popped up for one of our friends but the rest of us did not get the offer. However, our server, Gerardo, was nice enough to get two extra orders for us.

The cajun fries were delicious! They were a little on the thicker side -- sort of reminded me of frites. And they were seasoned so well! They also came with a dipping sauce but honestly, you don't really need it. It is definitely a dish worth trying. 

There is a brunch menu for Sundays and it lasts until 2 PM. On the other side of the menu, there are $5 cocktails just for brunch! They have sangria, mimosa, peach bellini, bloody mary, and micheladas. I decided to go for a peach bellini -- I mean, why not?! Peach juice with a small bottle of champagne! It was decent but I have to say that I do prefer the frozen version better. 

As for my meal, I decided to go for their pork fried rice: it has BACON, pork sausage, carrots, peas, and cabbage with an omelette on top. It was a HUGE portion and I definitely didn't finish it. I had to take it home. Unfortunately, I did not really notice much pork sausage in the fried rice but there was definitely bacon. It went quite well with the rice. The rice itself was kind of dry so it was kind of hard. The dish also needed more flavor...the bacon could only do so much. It also looked two-toned. The dish wasn't really prepared that well -- I think they used soy sauce but they didn't use enough to cover the whole dish .. either that or they just poured soy sauce into it but did not bother to mix it. The omelette on top? Ugh. Overcooked and looked like it was prepared in a microwave. I prefer my egg to be mixed in with my fried rice. 

I think if they used enough soy sauce, used some ham (or maybe even spam) with the bacon, mixed the egg into the fried rice, add some green onions, add in sesame oil, and some garlic bits ...it would have turned out better. Oh and better rice ... they might have used rice that was too old. 

Overall, I think their service is fantastic. Our server was nothing but helpful and was definitely on top of everything. As for the food, I was not that impressed with my dish so honestly, it's not really the type of place that I'd rush to come back to."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was sub-par we arrived late in the evening during the week and were seated promptly. Upon arrival, I observed a large number of large families and groups. We were seated in booth right across from the large groups which made the environment loud. The service was okay. The fiancé ordered a cocktail and our server came back with the incorrect drink. The service is what heavily reflected on this rating. Took awhile to have my water refilled, fiancés drink was never corrected and took an extended bit of time to receive our food. As for the food it lacked flavor. I choose a burger as I believed was impossible to mess up a burger. However, they managed to prove me wrong. The burger was dry, lacked flavor and was not filling. The dish wasn't presented well either, granted it's a burger, but presentation aside the food was lacking. 

I highly doubt I will return here as I was not impressed. The restaurant had plenty of parking and was located on the northwest end of downtown summerlin. They were adding more stores near by (which have been completed by now at the time of this review) so that may affect the availability of parking if you choose to come early.

It was okay but I have been happier elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch!  Miles was perhaps the best waiter we've had. He is friendly and knows the menu. He helped us make excellent selections without feeling pressured. Everything tasted great. Pups around made for added smiles. Nothing disappointed! It was all great, made better by great service. Thank you Miles!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty but service was horrible. I asked for extra salsa and it never came, nobody asked if I want another drink and my husbands ice tea was never refilled even though next table got it done while they glasses where half empty.. not impressed.. I'm not hoping for 5 stars service but this is unexpectedly bad for Tuesday.."}
{"text":"I arrived yesterday @ 11:30 to meet my friend Diane (1st time here) on the patio.  The last time I'd been there, dogs were allowed on half the patio & the patrons w/out dogs on the other half.  Not the case now.  Five women showed up with a poodle & 2 guys with an Airedale.  The noise level, due to a barking dog on the other side, Crate & Barrel construction that abuts the restaurant, & the garbage on the stereo were over the top for an afternoon lunch outdoors.  But we just had to be outside on this beautiful day.

Our server appeared shortly and we ordered 2 salads:  chicken/sundried tomato/feta, and the new strawberry w/goat cheese, both of us requesting dressing on the side.  Though the restaurant had few patrons, the food took way too long to appear.  When the salads arrived, I added creamy balsamic to mine & soon discovered the chef had already added dressing, so I had a bowl of dressing.  But that wasn't all... each cherry tomato was old & squishy, there was a small sliver of cheese, a few gushy strawberries, and for some reason they had little gobs of crunchy cereal throughout.  And this was whose idea?  My friend said her salad was okay, but it came with the lettuce shredded which restaurants seem to think is so cool these days.

A pet peeve of mine that leaves me frustrated & curious is why servers don't seem to be trained on seating arrangements (assuming there are enough other alternatives)...  i.e. if 2 seniors arrive, why would you seat them next to whiney children?  Or:  why would you seat two diners next to a table of 5 cackling women with a dog?  Or next to the kitchen, or in winter next to the outside door?  Know what I mean?

I soon realized that the great manager Phil has been gone for a few months, explaining why this trip (as well as the last) left a lot to be desired. And though this optimist doesn't want to adhere to \"all good things must come to an end,\" I'm going for greener pastures."}
{"text":"Waited so long to go here and I am not sure why--It's so good. We brought our fur baby here for his 10th birthday and he loved it. We sat outside on a really nice day. I love the fact that the patio is so big and you are not cramped up next to another family with a dog. 

We got the pitcher of peach sangria and it was the bomb. So we got another! We ordered a bunch of different items and they were all really good.

The birthday boy got the chicken with brown rice and peas and carrots. He was in heaven. I am so glad there is a place we can go as a family to eat that is close by. Sunday brunch is the best, those sangria pitchers were only $15. Woo Hoo! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went shopping with my bff at downtown Summerlin mall and a sales lady recommended us to come here to eat. Very nice setting, friendly server, and delicious food. The manager even stopped by to see how everything was. We ordered the spinach and sundried tomato cheese dip which was fantastic. My friend ordered coconut curry ahi tuna and I ordered the chicken and havarti foccacia sandwich. Very happy with our experience well be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We have a dog so we're always looking for dog friendly places to go.
I signed up for their club and got a coupon for my birthday which is 2 days after our dogs birthday so we went to do a double celebration dinner for both of us.
There were a few other dogs there when we arrived, when the hostess went to seat us 2 of the big dogs there barked and snapped at our dog who is not aggressive. So we asked to sit away from them in a nice quiet corner. They obviously don't enforce the \"rules\" they advertise because the group with the two mean dogs stayed about an half hour longer. 
Staff was great, they loved our dog but unfortunately can't pet him because of food service rules. They gave him a bowl of water and we ordered him the Chicken and Brown Rice off the doggie menu. It was very rice heavy so he dug out all the chicken and left most of the rice behind. Lol!
We started with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, not as good as PF Changs but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the Fish and Chips which was pretty meh, I wouldn't get it again. Doug got the Grilled Cheese and a bowl of the seasonal soup (Sausage, mushroom and brown rice). It was tasty. We got a beer flight of Lazy Dog beers to sample along the way, not bad.
For dessert (ha ha) I got an Asian Pear Martini...yum! I would definitely get it again! Doug tried the Coconut Mojito, it was a waste of liquor, thumbs down.
The food was pretty average but we like the atmosphere, drinks, and dog friendly patio. Will definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their menu is great (love that there's a full gluten sensitive menu) and the service is fantastic. Go!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't anything good to write home to mom about!  My wife ordered the Turkey Sandwich, the bread was stele and turkey was dry and we asked for no Mayo and can see where they put Mayo on the bread and then wiped off.  Just a poor attempt at a turkey sandwich.  I also order the sweet & spicy Wok Chicken stir.  The chicken was tough and really over cooked and the veggies were raw and not cooked.   The sweet corn chowder was good! Our overall food experience was crappy!  I really wish I could say the serving staff were friendly and we had great service.  However the young lady Samantha who waited us was not real friendly, didn't smile or communicate with us.  Her  nonverbal expressions were negative and she came a cross like she didn't like us or her job, if we were to go back to the Lazy Dog we would ask not to sit in her section.

I don't expect to going back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Calling all comfort food lovers.  Portions are big and hearty.  You probably only need to order half or less food as you would normally order at any other restaurant.  While the beer selection is not expansive, it is quite good for a chain restaurant.  One of the coolest things is their dog friendly patio.

Despite hopping with customers on a Friday night at 8pm, they had us seated in under 20 minutes.  After reading many yelps regarding the Chicken Pot Pie, Dave decided to give it a try.  It was good, but the best thing we tasted was the seasonal mushroom barley soup with giant chunks of mushroom.  Normally the barley overwhelms a soup, but this was just right.

I ordered the ribs.  The meat was nicely cooked, but the sauce was too sweet and the mashed potatoes and succotash were lifeless.  I asked for some butter and to my surprise they brought me some garlic butter, which helped give some life to the potatoes."}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly when previous plans fell through. Been wanting to bring the fur babes here for awhile but I was super hesitant because one pup is elderly and the other is a pit bull that is super sweet but can look a bit intimidating.

Right out of the gate, the whole staff made us feel extremely comfortable.  We felt awkward and just wanted to make sure the pups were out of the way. Everyone assured us that we were fine and they totally didn't care that we kept switching tables. They told us they wanted whatever was best for us and the fur babies even if it meant bouncing around.

Our server was great and brought us some complimentary waffle chips since we said it was our first time. Also, if you check in on yelp you get complimentary fries. We didn't take advantage of that since we were already getting fries with our meals. We both ordered a breakfast burger which was tasty and got the job done. They also have lots of drink specials they offer for their Sunday brunch. It was a nice touch as well that the manager came by a few times to check on us.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the location. Don't get me wrong. I personally LOVE Town Square. However, our big 80 pound pit was scared to death since it is right in the flight path to the airport and extremely loud for his sensitive ears. Poor guy was trembling and we realized how scared he was when he refused to eat the burger and brown rice we got for him. Luckily our other buddy is deaf and wasn't phased at all. So needless to say, instead of the nice leisurely brunch we were hoping for, we had to put a little extra wiggle in it and get Mr. Scaredy-Pants our if there. The good thing is they have another location in Summerlin that is hopefully much quieter. Just wish we could have the great staff and manager follow us there!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit here, both times it was great service and great food, what I didn't like, it's a noisy place! Alright for a group, to watch the big game and root for your team, but for dinner with family and trying to carry on a conversation, forget it, I feel like I had to shout to be heard!

The chicken palbano is slighty spicy, both times ( I had it last time, mother in law had it this time) there was just enough heat, spice and ratio of peppers to chicken. 

The burger was huge cooked just a little to long and was just a tad on dry side for medium cook, lots of blue cheese, fries could have been fresher. 

I had chicken tortilia soup, very cheesy and big chunks of chicken, moist and tender shreds, served with wedge of flat bread, pretty good! And I had the warm chicken Focaccia sandwich, moist chicken, plenty and stacked with lettus and tomato. 

For apps we had sweet potato tatter tots with a yummy dipping sauce lime cilanto and roasted brussel sprouts with capers and bread crumble, both good size and very good. 

Both visits had good servive but this trip the server missed the opportunity to sell us dessert, bringing our check to fast without asking! But the butter cake is a must have ( had it our first visit), overall good place for food, drinks, friends."}
{"text":"Great service by Drea! Very attentive. I would definitely go back and hope that she's working"}
{"text":"Love coming to Lazy Dog cafe! Such great food and service! Thanks, Reagan, for your awesome service!"}
{"text":"Had another great meal at my favorite restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. First and foremost, they treat my kids so well and they enjoy dining here. We chowed down on calamari, hummus, lettuce wraps, burgers and I had the country biscuits and fried chicken off the brunch menu. Food was stellar and our server was very attentive. Killer desserts as well! Look forward to enjoying the patio now that the weather is getting nicer. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Thank you to our waitress, Finn, who recommended the chicken poblano which was awesome! My husband was very happy with his fish and chips also. Oh, and we also had the inside out quesadilla for an appetizer; again, yummy! Great dinner and waitress!"}
{"text":"Clean establishment. Dog friendly. Good food, great bar.  Staff is always friendly and helpful. Seems like they care about their customers"}
{"text":"After a hike in Red Rock and needing to meet other family members for dinner, we decided on Lazy Dog. Everyone in our party of seven was satisfied with their food and we had an enjoyable meal. The casual atmosphere allowed everyone to relax and the large menu provided something to the liking for everyone in the group.

Arriving at 6:30 on Saturday night, we were first quoted a 45 minute wait. But when we denied the offer to wait, the hostess stopped us and offered us the long community table in the bar, which we accepted. Even though we were seated in chairs without back support we had plenty of elbow room. Service throughout the meal was excellent and they tackled our party without issue during a very busy dinner. Our server was quite friendly guiding us through the menu and the kitchen was efficient and there were no significant waits for anything.

The restaurant with the Rocky Mountain lodge decor and atmosphere has a large menu covering almost every cuisine. There was something for everyone in the group. I had the sticky ribs which were flash fried baby backs brushed with a molasses barbecue sauce. Your primary concern is that they \"flash\" fry the ribs opposed to deep frying them into leather. They did a good job as the ribs were fried perfectly with a crunchy outside and with moist, tender meat on the inside. I don't know if umami is an accurate descriptor of the fries, but they were still delicious. The portion did not completely fill me and I had plenty of room for dessert.

Also ordered were the chicken chile verde nachos, fettucine alfredo with chicken, chicken parmesan, house club, ginger soy salmon, carbonara, and the sesame crusted ahi. For dessert, the salted caramel creme brulee, butter cake,and white chocolate chip brownie. The nachos were full of toppings and did not last long on the table. The pasta weren't anything special, but sufficient for my daughter and her friend. The butter cake and brownie were absolutely devoured. I would recommend those two for sure if you have room. After we finished, the $$ price point for the entire meal was completely accurate.

Lazy Dog does a lot of things with their menu, but nothing is really outstanding. We did like the atmosphere and the family got to spend quality time together. Because the menu is so large, I wouldn't give up on them if you don't find something your first time around. Happy hour might be an ideal time to sample the menu because they offer a wide variety of food and drinks at very reasonable prices. I would have no problems stopping in for happy hour or for another meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I sat at the bar for happy hour and we got excellent service. Terri was the bartender. She was very attentive, gave great recommendations, and was very friendly. The bar top was full and they were busy but she always had her head up so she could see what the guests needed. If I were still a restaurant manager I'd try to steal her to come to my restaurant. 
Now to the food.... It was all so good. We got the potato hush puppies, ahi poke, calamari, the snake river salad, and the peach crumble. I know we're fatties. Everything was on point and so delicious. I will for sure be coming again for those items and can't wait to try other ones.
Terri made our first date night since having a baby 5 months ago extremely enjoyable. Thank you!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was out in Vegas last week for a work trip and met up with some local friends at Lazy Dog. The space itself is great - lots of seating and the hostess/servers were all quite friendly.

Food was all just \"fine.\" Nothing I'd write home about, but if you're hungry, and wanting something substantial, this place gets the job done.

I had the bison meatloaf and it was totally passable. The queso was okay, and the complimentary waffle chips were a nice touch. 

They had a pretty decent beer and cocktail list as well. 
It's a fine choice."}
{"text":"This place is the Best ... food is sooooo good here and if you want you can bring your dog  and have a nice date with your dog just know you will be sitting outside but it's worth it they have a nice eating area for you and you're puppy... but besides that the food is amazing. And customer service is amazing as well , we love coming here late at night-and it doesn't matter what time we go in they always have a great attitude the environment is really fun. Love this place and there Mac and cheese it's Amazing"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Even better if you have a dog with you.  They have a large covered outdoor seating area that has fans for the summer and heaters for the winter.  They even have someone going around with water bowls for your pooch.

The food is good, with healthy portions. It is part of Downtown Summerlin so it is a nice place to catch some good food while out shopping or even as a destination.  

The beer selections are quite vast."}
{"text":"Recently visited Las Vegas for the first time, Lazy Dog was one of the best restaurants we went to on our trip! We'll be back the next time we're out there. The food and drinks were great. Everything reasonably priced. Atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. Mike really made the experience for us, he took such good care of us and really made our visit memorable.

I think it's awesome that this restaurant is available to people with their dogs, you don't see that often, especially in big cities.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in the neighborhood so we decided to try it out. I've never been to a Lazy Dog Cafe but I heard good things about the one in Summerlin.
We went at about 14:00 so it pretty quiet, not very busy at all. We were seated promptly enough but it took close to 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by a server. A server did walk by and said that she would be right with us. 10 minutes later another server came and took our drink orders. In those 20 minutes though I saw other groups come in after us, get seated , and was immediately waited on by a server. The restaurant wasn't very busy and the staffing level was high enough than there should not have been any delays in service.
Our new server came back with our drinks and got our orders. Everything afterwards proceeded satisfactorily. 
The food was average, bordering on mediocre. I could have gone to any other restaurant and gotten the same food but with much better service. So I'm pretty sure this was my first and last time at this particular location."}
{"text":"Great place to chill and enjoy good food. Their Dirty Dog is a must try during happy hour! Thanks to Regan for accomodating us and being a great server overall!"}
{"text":"Okay so we came on Father's Day and a Sunday so understandable it's a busy day I work in the service industry I get it 100% fail number one: we ordered a pitcher of Sangria when we took the spoon out that they leave in it was a dirty spoon with peanut butter on it ewwwww that tells me that they put a used spoon probably to quickly stir it and forgot oops that was a dirty spoon I should've switched it absolutely gross but all of my friends are waitresses we don't care so we let it go the manager came over and made a quick little \"oh this one has no peanut butter on it\" joke. No it wasn't funny but we laughed because awkward you served something with dirty silverware. Fail number two: drinks spilled on us this is bad because I genuinely felt bad for the server you could tell he's had a bad day. Fail number three: wrong check dropped and again a joke to be added. All in all the food was great but the service is just so bad I'll never go back. I get it a busy day but no one cared that it sucked so bad and that's the worst part. Town square is still on the strip the service should be amazing so get it together."}
{"text":"Great food...their lazy dog beer sampler is AWESOME!! Bartenders Kevin & Lisa are wonderful!! I would highly recommend this place!! Kevin was super funny and Lisa was amazing...service like we got you dont get everywhere!!! Thank you for making our experience at your restaurant memorable!!"}
{"text":"First time here today after hiking in Redrock Canyon. We sat on the heated patio to eat as we had our dog. There were a handful of other dogs out there as well. The service was good, the food was good also. It is a nice spot to eat and take your dog with. They give the dogs a bowl of water and the dog menu is basic but great for dogs. Chicken, Beef, Brown and White Rice. My dog Panda loved her beef and brown rice bowl. I will definitely be back here again soon. This is also a good spot to eat even if you do not bring your dog with you."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is one of our favorite restaurants. I actually trained as a server for a couple weeks, but unfortunately my other job was too demanding. They really have their stuff together there. The food is AMAZING---you can't go wrong with any choice! The atmosphere is nice, the bar is pretty cool, and the patio is super nice where you can bring your dog. Kiana (not sure of the spelling) is seriously one of the best servers we've ever had; we've had her a couple times and she is awesome! She seriously had half of this huge part of the restaurant all to her self and she was still great!! We'll always ask for her when we go. Some of our favorite menu items are the All American burger, the black and bleu pizza, the sweet and spicy shrimp, the hatch chile mac n cheese, the Tex Mex salad, and the butter cake for dessert is to die for! The Asian pear martini and the sangrias are also so good!"}
{"text":"So on Friday, after doing some Ikea shopping with some of the besties, we were driving by downtown Summerlin shopping and wanted some grub, after some back and forth, we decided on Lazy Dog's. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to share my thoughts based on my experience

What I liked - The building is a stand alone on the North side of Downtown Summerlin mall complex with ample parking, thou the area was busy, we still had no problem finding a spot. As you walk in, the decor is pretty cool with 2 sculptures made from tools and locks in the form. Thou we didn't have any fur babies with us, we ate outside and the honestly the outdoor seating was really huge with a massive fire pit in the middle (thou not on).  Thou very busy, I felt our wait staff did an excellent job ensuring we were well taken care of.  It was also cool talking with everyone about their puppies and letting us pet them while we chatted. I really appreciated the design as outdoor seating is contained so no dogs can get out.

opportunities - The only thing keeping this from the convented 5 STAR RATING was the food quality. Myself, I got the fish and chips, OK, I know fish and chips is more of a coastal thing, but if I see fish and chips, I try it. I felt like the fish was just meh and was dry, took a lot of tarter sauce. My friends 6 year old got the kids Mac and cheese and it looked and tasted like something from a dollar box of Mac and cheese. On a positive note, the sweet tater tots were pretty good. 

In conclusion, cool place to hang out and puppy watch, not sure if the restaurant is known for a special dish so let me know if there are any recommendations, but unless I'm out with my puppy, don't think I need to go back"}
{"text":"Friendly and excellent guest services. Thank you Arizona our Waitness and Phi the manager. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been four times since it opened and every time the service was fabulous, food was great and everything went smoothly. Really no complaints at all. What mostly got me was how friendly all of the staff is! The host team, management, servers, they were all wonderful! Not to mention my four year old son loves it there and constantly asks to revisit :)"}
{"text":"Amy was amazing!   Went for lunch Sunday afternoon and had the hush puppies & fish and chips with several of the juniper gin cocktails!   My friend loved her black & blue burger!   GM walking around helping with everything.  So hands on and awesome to see!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"DROP Claim Jumper, Chilis, and Cheesecake. This place puts them to shame.  Kudos to the staff here from top to bottom. This place is welcoming and all pro.  We were seated quick and courteously.  Our order was taken.  The manager Jake came by to welcome us as this is our first visit and have is a complimentary appetizer.  Real hospitality.

The menu.  A lot of goodies to choose from. I tried the Campfire Pot Roast. Perfect for this weather today. Best ever.  I mean this is my go to dish all the time and this is the best ever. 

The value.  Very well priced and plates were very healthy.   My cup was never empty and the service is more than 5 star. I wish I could give them more stars.

THis is for sure my go to place.  I have to say this is one of my best dining experiences. Great job guys.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Black and blu burger was good.  The Cajun fries were a joke. Staff was awesome.  Other than that.  Probably won't go back with all the restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the food and our server Chelsea was awesome. I only wish they allowed us to eat inside which I know is impossible with a dog."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit here. We wanted to celebrate my pups 4th birthday. We absolutely love this place! So awesome that we could bring our dog to dinner with us. The food was fresh and delicious. The only issue I had was the lighting we sat at a table where there was no light we had to use our phones flash light to look at the menu. But overall we enjoyed our dinner. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with our daughter and grandson ate at the Downtown Summerlin location of TheLazy Dog this past week. I usually enjoy leaving positive reviews because I believe too often, people share anything that is bad and usually not the good. But, unfortunately we had an awful experience at the location. I ordered the turkey with cranberry salad sandwich. It had very little flavor.  My husband ordered shrimp tacos and honestly there had to be half a head of lettuce left over after eating the tacos. He said all he could really taste was the lettuce. My daughter ordered a pizza and had to wait over 20 minutes for a waitress to return so we could ask for red pepper flakes. Granted, this was 12/23  and the place was busy with holiday shoppers, but that doesn't excuse waiting 15 minutes just to turn in drink orders. Then we waited again to turn in food orders. Once food was delivered, we did not see our server,Isabel, again for at least 45 minutes, we only saw her because we snagged another employee to please pass a message that we needed more drinks since we'd been out for over a half hour by now.  Being without a drink for 30 minutes is no easy task when faced with a flavorless turkey sandwich and a head of chopped lettuce. I loved the atmosphere in their restaurant and although I though the staff was friendly, I won't be returning. My husband and I make it a habit of leaving 25% minimum tip but in this case, Isabel only received a 4.00 tip on a 50 something dollar tab. I figured I should tip because we did get our drinks and the correct food thaws ordered.  The fact that we didn't enjoy the dishes is not her fault but that if the cook. But giving a smidgen of attention to your customers might turn out good In the end"}
{"text":"I am very satisfied I have dined in here and also today I ordered delivery. The food came so fast its still hot, and the ice cream is cold ... everything tasted amazing like always and the GrubHub delivery lady was very sweet. The burger is huge by the way :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had great service and the food was wonderful.  Their wok dishes are to die for. David and Vegas were great. They gudied me through the menu and had great suggestions.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely improved. Had couple of bad experiences but much better now. Met the Manager Phil and he's very receptive and a hard worker. Food is great with unique menu items. Beer and drinks are great. Food quality is great. Different flavors for everyone. No mistakes today for lunch. Server was very attentive which was great. Prices are reasonable for Las Vegas. Not a fast food garbage restaurant. Good environment for groups and social gatherings. Definitely try it out. I feel Lazy Dog is a great addition to Las Vegas restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The food here is better on the menu than in reality.  Cajun fries were kind of dried. Ahi tuna tartare didn't have the best food pairing.

But the big selling point here is 1) a very expansive menu, and 2) DOGS DOGS EVERYWHERE!!"}
{"text":"Average food, and poor service. We had a party of 6, were seated ordered and a manager gave us a free flatbread because it was our first time eating there. Pretty average tasting. Ordered one appetizer I guess the waitress thought we wanted 2 which we didn't and sent it back. I ordered the carne asada skillet. The meat was rare in the middle and the rice tasted like dog food. Person at our table asked for her soup to be re heated because it was cold and the waiter never brought it back. Just average food wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I have been in a lots of restaurant & bar but somebody like me  travel all the world  the Lazy Dog in Summerlin Las Vegas is a WOW  thank you Jake the General Manager thank you the Chef Amazing & thank you Daniel & bartenders as always amazing  food quality & drinks is the best thanks again sincerely A.Luna  Pd Thank you Angelo The area director"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Lazy Dog and their wonderful staff!! Brooke the ASM is a sweetheart! She came over and checked in our meals and had a nice chat! I am always impressed with their staff and table manners with my dogs! I think it's awesome training that they make sure to give us our dogs food for us to hand to them! The food is always delish! Make sure to grab dessert and movie tickets at a discounts! By far my favvv restaurant for me and my little family! Thank you Lazy Dog for always being the best of the best!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch since its opened and absolutely love it. The food is great and the service is even better! Server Brooke was exceptional tonight. Huge selection on the menu and everything I've ordered I've loved-- esp the Cesar salad and the tuna w/ cauliflower mash. YUM! This place is consistently busy & for a good reason. Totally recommend this place for anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"(4.5)  Decided to come here for a Tuesday afternoon Happy Hour and was overall satisfied with the experience.  Have been to another Lucky Dog in California and I like this one better, probably cause it's newer.  Very pleasant upbeat atmosphere with 80s music playing in the background.

We didn't order any cocktails, however, really like the layout of their bar and have a great selection of beers on tap.  Also, appreciate the nod to local Vegas brewery Banger as they have their Jalapeno Hefe on tap.  Try it, it's really good. 

So we ordered the boneless wings which were served on blue cheese slaw; really crunchy outside with tender chicken inside. Yum.  Just wish there was more slaw. The sweet potato tots were another bite of deliciousness with a zesty dipping sauce. Mmm.  Just note that some of the portions on happy hour are smaller compared to normal apps.  Didn't order any this time, but have tried the edamame before; really great with the spicy Asian flair. 

My only complaint was my water glass was empty for 10 minutes; but had a nice time and  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The people are great!! The food is awesome. Everyone remembers who I'am. They make me feel special. Btw the guys are cute!! My last server Jennifer was great!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great here! One of my favorites!! 

I've been here multiple times. From when they first opened to recently. They've definitely improved on everything service-wise! 

Eating with a pup:
We took our dog here for her birthday. They have you sit outside in their patio area. If you have a more rowdy dog, I don't recommend going during their peak hours. We came on a weekday afternoon, and were able to find a table far enough away from all the other pups. They give your dog a water bowl just as your table gets glasses of water. We ordered her the chicken and rice bowl. Great portion size because she's a fairly small dog. She loved it! Nearly finished it. 
The waitress was friendly and all was dandy. 

Happy Hour:
One of my favorites in the summerlin area. Delicious sangria! (Order by the pitcher for $15!) the chipotle fries are great for the price. All of their snacks are yummy and affordable. Happy hour is in bar area or patio during specific times ONLY so keep that in mind! 

Inside dining:
This is why the review has 4 stars. Eating dinner here is nothing more than eating at an expensive Applebees. The food is alright, but nothing memorable. Service is fantastic, though!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is a great place. The staff is attentive, there is a bar with TVs turned to sports, and there is an outdoor patio where your pup can hang out. The architecture is beautiful and the ambiance is family oriented. Their food portions are large and the food is very good. The Thai salad was excellent. Would have given it 5 stars except it gets really busy and noisy (inside) so tough to have conversations. Overall, a great place to go."}
{"text":"Went in with my mom and the staff was super nice. The staff was nice enough to split both our salad and burger. They also brought us a flatbread since it was my first time there."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 only on the two food items I had. But atmosphere is a 5 star by far!! The staff is really friendly and the place was very clean. Super hipster place. Dog friendly. They give your pet water! 
The tortilla soup I had came out a little bland for my taste but has lots of potential. 
The Mac and cheese was ok, not a big fan of the green breading they put on top because it dried out the moisture. 
My sangria was fantastic! I got the bartender to mix  both red options for a fantastic new drink!! 
I'll deff come back!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Shannon our waitress was superb. She made our day. The food was good.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"Regan is super friendly and helpful

The food here is consistently good

The patio for dogs and their own dog menu is awesome"}
{"text":"My family and I were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! The outdoor seating has a big fireplace, heaters, and covers for insulation. The service was great, along with the food. I love love that this place was dog friendly!! 

We ordered: Thai noodles, fried chicken plate, BBQ bison, and the chicken parm. All were delicious albeit a bit too sweet. 

The Thai noodles dish, I think, was the most impressive. It's not exactly like pad Thai but very similar, especially for an American restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's always been fun and nice. The vibe is really chill and it's awesome that they have a really nice patio and you can bring your pups along :) they also have a pup menu which I think is amazing! The food is really good and so are the drinks :) I have tried the  Baja California burger which is amazing because let's be honest, guac on a burger is amazing, and I've tried the Cajun fries, the calamari which actually comes with rice (it's like orange chicken flavor but with squid) and the buffalo chicken lollipops which were really good as well. It's a chill and fun place and would totally recommend if you've never been!"}
{"text":"We come to Lazy Dog all the time! It's our favorite.  Great atmoshpere, great service, exceptional food, and a fun outdoor dining area."}
{"text":"My mom and I met friends here for lunch recently.  They brought their dog so we ate on the patio.  I guess Lazy Dog is dog friendly and they always can seat you on the patio.  They give dogs water and you can order dog specific food for them.  

I had the Pot Pie - roasted chicken, slow-cooked vegetables.  This was a bit bland but was warm and comforting.  I loved the crust on it.  Mom had the Grilled 5 Cheese - cheddar, swiss, mozzarella, jack, parmesan sourdough toast.  Mom liked this.  Not too thick.  Good fries.  One friend had the Baked Wild Huckleberry Pancake - strawberries, huckleberries, raspberries, maple bacon butter, warm maple syrup, housemade whipped cream.  She really liked this.  It was huge.  Her husband helped her eat half of it.  He ordered a special off the brunch menu that he liked.  Can't remember what it was.

So overall a nice place.  Good place to go with a dog.  Lots of food options.  Big bar area.  Good place to watch a good or have a drink."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner as i was in town for work. I've been to Lazy Dog before so I knew what to expect. The place is great place to go eat with a good variety of food. Also a relaxing place to come grab a drink at night watch some sports or just chill.

I ordered the bison meatloaf. It was great !! I can't wait to come back and try it again. Service was fast and easy I sat at the bar top and ordered. The place was not too crowded for a Tuesday night. If I'm ever in the area again I'll come back."}
{"text":"***New to yelp so sorry if its a bit wordy***

We went to Lazy Dog for the first time yesterday and we were amazed. When we first arrived the hostess was pleasant and guided us to our booth. Immediately after seating, we were greeted by our waiter named Oscar. Oscar was very attentive to our needs, gave us a few suggestions after we had asked him for some and answered any questions we had about their plates. He even offered us healthier alternatives that were listed on the rear of the menu (probably since were were dressed in athletic gear).

As we were trying to decide what to try, the restaurant manager surprisingly brought us flat bread (pictured) to try for it being our first time at Lazy Dog. The Flat bread was great in taste which we decided to save a portion of to eat with our entree. 

After deciding what to order, we went with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots and Bahama Chicken (both pictured). The Tater Tots were positively delicious and the Bahama Chicken was great. The Bahama Chicken is described as a Jerk Chicken which normally has a kick (spice) to it but this plate had a ever so slight kick.

Oscar also informed us of the Cajun Fries (pictured) that are free if you were to place a Yelp Review for the restaurant, which we completed. The Cajun Fries were delicious and were a relatively large portion.  We would definitely order these again.

Throughout our experience, the manager visited our table twice. Once to deliver the Flat Bread and second to inquire how everything was turning out. Oscar was also very attentive to our tables needs and didn't let our waters run dry (I must add that I drink tons of water).

Overall, we felt that our experience went very well for our first time at the Lazy Dog. There was not a wait at all (we arrived around 1pm) and upon us leaving, the restaurant was getting a good flow of guests. The work staff seemed to be very pleasant and happy to be there, especially the restaurant manager (whose name I forgot, sorry if you're reading this) and Oscar our waiter. The dishes were excellent in taste and reasonably affordable. Their menu had a great deal of selections although slightly wordy making the menu a little intimidating. Great ambience and good music to go with it."}
{"text":"We were there last night with the fam and it was perfect. Alejandro our server is amazing, I had the turkey meatballs and ginger salmon, excellent quality, fresh and perfect seasoning!! Alejandro recommended me the pink lemon drop martini, that I really enjoyed. He even sang for us. Thank you Alejandro. We will see you soon."}
{"text":"We tried this out in Las Vegas, it was a large menu.
I tried crispy ribs and we also ordered appetizers, wings and cheese dip.   I thought all the food was just average for the cost.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The service was great. Liked the atmosphere and that if I wanted to bring my dog with me we could both enjoy the patio. 
The brunch drink specials were so worth it. My michelada  really hit the spot after the shopping. The tuna \"burger\" with a side of cucumber salad was perfectly rare and very flavorful. There are several items that beg to be tried on the menu, so a return visit is a must."}
{"text":"Lazy Dogs has consistently good food and service. Ask for our server Jessie. Today he gave a good recommendation for the bison meatloaf and it was outstanding! I also enjoyed the fresh blueberry lemon martini. Everything at Lazy Dogs is delicious!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog has good food and atmosphere. HOWEVER, the staff is not on the same page. No team work at all and management doesn't seem to care what's going on. Our server was so slammed and we felt really bad that none of the other servers or managers were helping him out. I decided to speak to the manager on duty about the lack of assistance and he went out to help our server (who was working VERY hard btw) but intentionally avoided my table as if he was too afraid to address the situation with me after I spoke to him. Just really unfortunate. Our server Los was really great though despite him having no help from his \"team.\""}
{"text":"I found the staff to be the best, however the food was nothing to right home about and the price was a bit much especially the lunch specials. I prefer Miller's Ale House to Lazy Dogs just saying."}
{"text":"They have the BEST calamari!! It's a small plate, but eats like a meal! I have come to Lazy Dig many times and have brought my friends and family, held business meetings here and have never experienced any thing less han delicious food. I also love it because it doesn't taste processed or rushed. Looks and taste like it's made with love.

The ONE time that I do, Andres and Brooke, the manager went above and beyond to fix it and make it right. Honestly, the calamari alone would have brought me back eventually, but her and her team have made a customer for life.

If you're looking for a great meal that never disappoints and exceptional staff, come to Lazy Dog in Summerlin. They truly care about the customer, the happy Hour is awesome, the drinks are delicious and the food taste homemade."}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant often and usually sit outside with my dogs.  Went a few days ago with good friends and their Service dog, Paddington, seated  inside at a comfortable table to accommodate us.  

Lunch was so much more enjoyable because of Adam Fox, who not only provided excellent service but great conversation.  Will ask for Adam when I return as he made it more of an experience than just lunch.  

A special thank you to Scooby, Isabel and Maria, service a smile!"}
{"text":"It was great! Drinks, food & service were the best we've had on our visit to Vegas. It was wonderful to have something fresh!"}
{"text":"We've been back multiple times since the first review and have had much better experiences as a smaller party.
Food is hit or miss, but mostly average to good. The fish and chips are excellent and my husband is a huge fan of the fish tacos (crisp, light and flavorful) as well as the discontinued tofu curry dish, but their chicken sandwich was a bit bland and the club sandwich was just ok. 
The butter cake is the stuff dreams are made of. We usually never order dessert, but it's worth it here for this cake. A wonderful blend of flavors, textures and temperatures. Try it!
Food comes out pretty quickly (definitely fast enough for groups with small children) and, overall, service is attentive and friendly.
The outdoor patio is really a treat to sit at and the atmosphere is warm. We keep coming back."}
{"text":"First time we went we had a bad experience starting when we called for call ahead seating and were placed on hold forever. When we showed up to the restaurant the management team worked very hard to correct the issue. What's best is you can tell they were sincere about making us happy. We went back last night for the first time since the incident and it was great. We had the pot roast which was delicious and the sangria was pretty tasty as well. Management is always visible throughout the floor which I admire quite a bit. I think this place is going to continue to thrive if they continue on the road they are on!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great flight of house beers! Tonya the bartender was great to talk to, and everything was very clean! We will definitely become regulars quickly!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.  Was there for happy hour.  Food was decent and well priced.  Good beer, service was friendly but not very attentive had to wait awhile between drinks.

A plus is you can bring your dog to the patio area and eat and drink with your pup."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a friend a few nights ago and we really liked the food and drinks that we had. We both had the house sangria, which were both pretty good; mine was a tad bit too sweet though. I ordered the pizza they had in their happy hour which was really good especially since they let me customize my topping order. My friend ordered the chicken fingers, which were huge, and I love that it wasn't too breaded. We also shared the chicken lettuce wrap, which was my favorite of all (not including the drinks;) ). The sauces they offered with it was delicious and complimented the dish very well.
Definitely a place to check out if ever you're in Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Had a small casual business meeting there last Sunday night. Each of us easily found something on the menu and the fare/drink was comfortably affordable and the atmosphere and the meal were exactly what we had hoped for.  Haylee was our server and made sure our drinks were filled and needs were attended to. She was friendly and professional and i'm sure we will be dining there again in the future."}
{"text":"Love lazy dog! The patio is just wonderful and I've never been to a more dog friendly place that isn't in Colorado. They even have doggy items on the menu just for your pupper. Although dog friendly, it's not overly crazy as they have a good set of rules for our four legged compadres. 

Aside from the great atmosphere and friendly staff, they have the best edamame in all the land. I've never been a huge 'mam fan till I moved here but I'm hooked. Hummus ain't bad either. Happy hour menu is great and they have one of the best beer offerings in town.

There is a great bartender there that looks like Wolverine; he told me I'd be back often after the first time I was there, and well, Hugh Jackman wasn't wrong. This place rocks."}
{"text":"The Lazy Dog is now my all time favorite restaurant. Their food is incredible. It has a ton of different types of food so you are sure to find something you're in the mood for. Most restaurants usually suck at some different types of cuisines but this place has nailed them all down. I have yet to try something I have not liked. 

Before we get into the specifics of food, let's go over the ambience. It's really cool and rustic with a cabin feel. It's pretty big and there's a big bar in the center. 

For my drink I tried the sangria sampler and Oh. My. God. It was amazing. I slurped those things down like there was no tomorrow. I highly recommend them. I love all three flavors. I also ended my night with a snow cap that was pretty good! I'm generally not a huge fan of night caps but this one hit the spot in all the right ways. 

Food time. I ordered the pot roast beef tip and holy crap it was the best thing I've ever tasted. It comes with crispy fries, broth for dipping, and a delicious roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and caramelized onions. By far the best roast beef sandwich in town. 

My husband ordered the sweet and spicey shrimp and it was a million times better than PF Changs. And I'm a woman that loves her PF Changs.

For dessert I had The Simms Family S'more. It may have been family size but it was no match for me. I inhaled that bad boy. It could have used ice cream for some added texture but it was definitely delicious!

I will be coming back very soon! The food is too good to pass up! I also suggest ordering from DoorDash if you want Lazy Dog but don't want to eat out. They delivered the food to my door so fast it was still too hot to eat!"}
{"text":"Didn't come here for the food. Came to have a drink and sit in their patio. Service is great. Everyone is real nice."}
{"text":"I have been three times now, and I feel like this place is really suffering from inconsistent service and food.

We have always come for late night Happy Hour, never had to wait, and have sat on the Patio which is great. We have had a really great waitress, an ok waitress and a really odd waitress. The last one was the really odd one and she was very flighty, couldn't seem to follow what we wanted and just not all together there.

This last time I ordered a drink I have had each time, a sparkling Strawberry Margarita, and while it was great both times before, this time it arrived completely flat. I tried to drink it but it was gross so I asked if they could remake it, they did, this time it was fizzy but I am pretty sure it had zero booze in it. Very disappointing. I gave up and got the house Hef, which was just ok. 

Things we have gotten:

Late night burger: Comes with different things on it each time. Last time husband said no mayonnaise or sauce, comes with sauce, had to send it back, waitress insisted it was the wrong burger and husband says that the girl that delivered it said it was the late night burger, waitress comments \"well we don't hire them for their brains\"......that was rather shocking.

Hummus Trio: Hummus is good, cucumber has ranged from good to soft and floppy, bread has ranged from great to terrible

Mashed potato bites: Have been good each time, but the heat of the sauce has varied a lot

Buffalo chicken bites: Horrific....weird rubber texture

Canjun Fries: Yummy

Edamame: Yummy



So, after last time, which was the worst visit so far, I have no idea when/if we will be back. So far the nice patio has been the only consistent thing about our visits and frankly if sitting outside is the best part of your dining experience, then something is wrong with the place."}
{"text":"It's located right outside Red Rocks.

It's a great local chain with a great vibe.

Great selection of craft beer on tap.

Incredible happy hour menu. (I miss this, Happy Hour is a joke in Alaska!)

Varied and eclectic menu.

They also allow dogs on the porch!

4-stars because my steak was a bit on the tough side, and I'd call it more medium-rare than rare."}
{"text":"Really liked this restaurant. The google maps wasn't exactly right to get there but we found it. I would suggest they claim it on google and make sure it maps correctly or people could sadly end up at the wrong place or annoyed in the shopping center. Food was really good. I got fish and chips and even ate my leftovers the next day and I never eat leftovers. Had a glass of wine and all the folks that I was with really enjoyed their meals as well. I like that people can bring their dogs if they sit outside.  I hope this place makes it for a while as it is great."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: LOVED the awesome super dog friendly patio. Really relaxing with a dog at almost every table. Cool fire pit in the middle that you can eat. Nice patio furniture and umbrellas. 

Food: delicious chicken tortilla soup and ceasar salad, kids make your own pizza and hubby loved the brunch menu with country fried chicken with biscuit and sunny side up eggs. 

Service: excellent service provided by our server Jessica. She even brought a water bowl for our dog. 

Will definitely return and waiting for the Town Center location to open up!"}
{"text":"So I come here to try their Home Cooked food and surprisingly I didn't feel like vomiting  I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup  and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually really good. Good chunks of chicken breast the avocado was firm yet supple to the bite and the broth was a good clear consistency filled with bites of Tomato , cheddar cheese and tortilla strips. So I ordered the fish and chips and instead of fries I got mashed potatoes because nothing says home cooking like homemade mashed taters.  And this creamy Apple vinegar coleslaw was surprisingly delish! Creamy in all the right places without being overbearing it sweet. The acid of the vinegar balanced it all out and kept each bite as pleasant as the next.  My friend ordered the chicken pot pie and next to my own it was also a surprise. A huge round helping of pot pie perfectly built so all bites keep a good amount of edible warmth. I had to have two bites ! I got the loaded hush puppies but it was too much mashed potatoes not enough puppy for me. It's a bit misleading because there is no bread like texture however that's my error for not reading thoroughly enough.  It was too much potatoes on potatoes.  So dinner was not a disaster lastly we ordered the Butter Cake ! House made butter cake topped with a minted strawberry compote & vanilla bean ice cream garnished with sweet balsamic.  Ok so the butter cake and ice cream are to die for. Now me coming from the land of derby I'm picky with where mint intermingles with other organic natures.  The strawberry mint compote was a tad overwhelming.  The balsamic seemed pointless I can see they wanted it to cut through the richness of the cake and ice cream however it clashes.  A strawberry lemon compote with a different component would have been nicer however we still destructed the whole thing. When I first walked in I was angered they seated us and for 5-7 minutes no one came to get us drinks.  I explained to our server Sarah that I was pretty upset and throughout the whole dinner she was pretty, pleasant and polite. Her demeanor totally helped calm me down and helped me to better enjoy my meal. She truly cares about her customers and it shows!   She is definitely the kind geared towards management.  Thanks Sarah! I'll ask for your every time I come back and we will be back! How can we not have our friends try the goodies you have to offer :)  Everyone Ask for Sarah she's amazing! Truly!"}
{"text":"OMG - LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!

Everything was delicious, parking was easy, our dog could be on the patio with us and our waitress was super nice.  The portions weren't dainty and flavor hits you nicely.

Only thing I could talk bad about this place is not in their control -- the airport is so close & landing planes are SOOO loud & SOOO close to you. Freaked my hubs a little, but ehh... didn't bother me!  

Highly recommend this place. When we head back home, I'll look for other locations close to us & hope they are at the same quality as here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and drink during the soft opening. The salmon, chicken dishes, salads, appetizers and desserts are very good.  Something for everyone on the menu.  Bar menu is the bomb, ambiance upbeat,  and the service was very friendly though a bit slow.  Nice patio in downtown Summerlin great for a relaxing meal.  Prices won't puck you.  Kid and pet friendly.  Try the rhubarb dessert.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Nothing great.  We ordered the calamari which was chewy and did not seem fresh.  If you told me it was chicken I would have believed you.  We also ordered the short ribs, and they were better, but nothing that would make me return.   The service was good - thank you for that."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what to eat here and for some reason I chose the chicken pot pie and it was a mistake honestly. I got tired of it after 4 bites, i didnt like it. Also it took us a while before we even got our food. Oh yeah I also found a small hair in my food but they took care of my meal. Im literally not even made abt the hair BECAUSE IT HAPPENS. Like i worked in food before and sometimes its inevitable but they took care of it nicely so im not mad. Im more upset that i didnt like the way my pot pie tasted. Other than that my server carlos was really nice and my friends liked their food... I just wish i did too."}
{"text":"My wife and I had date night at this location and we had the greatest experience. Rachel was our waiter and she was attentive and on top of our drinks. We never had to ask her for a refill and she got our complicated order correct and was very friendly.
This type of service should be the goal for every restaurant and Rachel made our night. Thanks again for making our date night special and we will be back this weekend.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been back multiple times since my first review. As I said I know the restaurant from its California roots.

This location is not the same as when I started coming to lazy dog. The management doesn't seem to be fully invested in the restaurants success or the customers satisfaction. 

It is no longer about fresh food prepared to order. Somewhere along the lines they fell into the same trap as Chilis and Applebees... 

The service and food are average in a city where there are restaurants on every corner you need to do something to stand out and they are either unwilling or unable."}
{"text":"I was invited to a soft opening and it was great! Lazy Dog restaurant  had  high energy and every employee was on their toes! The decor had a log cabin feel with some interesting iron works sculptures. This place is dog friendly in the patio. There was three at my party. My favorite dish was the Chicken Poblano. Boneless chicken breast sautéed with sweet white corn, peppers and onions in a roasted poblano cream sauce, served with crispy tamale cakes, micro cilantro and Tapatio crema,  yum!  The salmon dish was good too and to top it off he Key Lime cheesecake was tasty."}
{"text":"First and last time I will come to your dog friendly restaurant. I was told I couldn't have my lap dog on my lap by the passing hostess while 30% of the other dog owners in the patio did, only because I was seated in plain view of the patio doorway. She had no reasoning when I asked her why other than \"it's just our rule!\" Patio was overwhelmed with dog on the floor and chained up to the legs of the table or chairs. My Italian Grey's were a little anxious on the floor. I asked the waiter for the manager.. did not come out, instead he explained the reason behind the dumb rule. \"Health Codes\" didn't make sense after seeing dog food plates going from the dirty hairy floor to the table we eat on to be picked up by a busser.  Explain that"}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review because it's been over a year since I've been here.  What can I say! That are even better than the first time!. We were sat right away even tho it was packed.  They let me sample the pineapple sour beer before deciding to order it  (it's delicious btw!).  Then we were ready to order.  There was almost no wait for our food! Our main course did come out before our appetizers, but the food came out so fast we actually didn't mind! But that didn't stop the manager from stopping by and apologizing and offering a free dessert!  This has been the best dining experience I have ever had. Thank you Reagan and Raul!!"}
{"text":"Came back to Lazy Dog with my dog, Champ, and he had a great lunch so he wanted to share his experience on Yelp (his paws are too big for typing so I helped him out) - here it goes:

[WOOF!]

Richard took me hiking again at Red Rock. I like it there. All that hiking made me hungry and extra thirsty. When we passed by Lazy Dog, I told him to stop XP

We didn't go inside - dogs like me can't go in. But there's a big outdoor area with TVs, fireside seating, and lots of other dogs! So many dogs today, I thought I was at the dog park. [WOOF]. The table next to ours, there was another cool dog and his name was Champ too!

Richard told me there are rules: (1) I can't sit on his lap or the table (I'm too big anyway), (2) no begging, barking, or biting; no problem, (3) I can't eat from his plate (I'll get my own), and (5) he has to keep me on the leash always.  OK! :)

Our kind server brought water and I drank it up. There was chicken on the dog menu, but I wanted hamburger. I even got to choose how it cooks.  [DROOL]. I went with medium. Even comes with choice of white or brown rice - I'm a brown dog so I chose brown rice.

I like it here. More restaurants need to have dog menus. I want to come back again."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a restaurant in California. The food is very tasty and fresh and they have lots of options! The downfall unfortunately is the hostesses are young, inexperienced and it took me 20 minutes to make a reservation for my birthday , I had to call them back multiple times because I remained on the line for so long.  They tried to find a manager and couldn't . Also they have ONE song that plays over and over when your put on hold!! Finally when they said I had my reservation i relaxed until the day of when they didn't even have it when we arrived!! So after all that we had to wait for a table ! Then the next day they called and reminded me of my reservation for the night !! Talk about a headache!! Left a sour taste in my mouth which is unfortunate since I do enjoy the food :) try it out but don't try and make a reservation ... Save yourself the trouble!"}
{"text":"Ok. Gave them another shot. I had a pretty good burger. The apple crumble was good too. Only issue was that they gave my wife cafinated coffee when she ordered decaff, no she has the shakes."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Place was very busy on a Friday. FYI Happy Hour menu is only at the bar and close surrounding tables."}
{"text":"My interest was piqued when we first saw this place being built at Downtown Summerlin and read about the strange concept coupled with great reviews from their California locations.

Well, we finally went this weekend and it was a very cool joint.

The place was absolutely packed with humans and dogs alike. We didn't have our dog with us, so we sat indoors in order to get a seat sooner.

The menu is pretty extensive and covers a wide variety of cuisine-types. My girlfriend and I both ordered off the lunch menu. I had the spicy garlic chicken noodle bowl and she had a personal pizza and salad. Everything was great.

They carry beers from the Pub at Goldenroad out of LA which is a big plus for us.

Atmosphere is pretty nice with a modern lodge feel and quite a few large tvs around the bar area."}
{"text":"This place is great. Their food is great and the service is attentive. Some of the appetizers are over priced for the amount. But everything I've had was on point. I would recommend this with no hesitation."}
{"text":"Had a going-away dinner here with a friend. First time here. Pretty nice. Very relaxed. We shared some hot fries, ordered a pizza, and a sandwich, and a kids meal, etc. Nothing that really stands out in my mind other than our servers were really attentive even though it was change of shift. We sat inside too, so didn't see any dogs."}
{"text":"We met another couple here for drinks and dinner and were impressed with the ambiance, decor and service which was very attentive and friendly. Drinks were great and so was the food: very reasonably priced and something for everyone. Large servings, good quality, tasty and all round a very enjoyable evening. While we didn't bring any furry friends with us, we were very happy to see they had a dog friendly patio and have over 20 locations from California to Las Vegas and apparently soon in the Florida panhandle. As full time travelers and RVers, this is definitely a place we would return to and recommend, especially to those who like to take their dogs to restaurants and want to feel welcome. Good job Lazy Dog!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and always a great experience! Buffalo cauliflower is super yummy. Blistered green beans are delicious. And the banana pudding is to die for! Ask for Katrina because shes a sweetheart, super attentive and great personality. Will definitely keep you entertained :) we'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"By far the best all purpose restaurant in Vegas.. The food is great.. We shared the baby backs, the service was terrific, and after the meal, Jose , the manager brought us hand towels with lemons to clean up.. Where in Vegas at these prices do they do that.. The answer is nowhere.. Go to Lazy Dog in Downton Summerlin, for one of the best dining experiences in Vegas. I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Kim was our server she was great. Got the pulled pork sandwich like always loved it!! Great service food and drinks just like always see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Great Peach Bellinis and service. Grilled cheese sandwich was great is also. The tomato soup needs reworking."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to order from Clean eats to not so clean they have a variety of everything cajun fries are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I never really leave bad reviews but this is not ok. 

My food was 30 minutes late, order missing items  and no apologizes for not bring out my curbside meals after I called twice. Its called curbside but tonight it was pick-up for me. 

Neverless, when I walk in two hostess a young man and a young woman are just standing there with my order sitting on the counter. 

No apologizes at all. The restaurants wasnt busy so there is really no excuse. I got my order because we have had a long day and didnt want to wait any longer.

This is one of the reasons chain restaurants are failing, lack of decent customer service."}
{"text":"DOG FREINDLY OUTDOOR PATIO SEATING!

Yessssss'

This place is a go to spot for brunch, and lunch for our family.. personally I love the bison burger and pineapple mojitos. My kiddos enjoy the huckleberry pancake for sharing and my bride loves the mimosas!

We haven't had a bad experience, only hiccup is a small wait on the weekend for brunch.. other than that the food has been fresh, the restaurant and restrooms are clean.

Ohh, the best is the dog menu for your pup.. they get their own meal too!!! SCORE."}
{"text":"Ahhh.. Another restaurant opens in Downtown Summerlin, one can go broke sampling all the restaurants that are located here. My newest adventure is Lazy Dogs located just outside of Red Rock Casino. It's like BJ's if I was going to compare it to another restaurant. You enter next to a beautiful bar that's set up nicely for happy hour. The restaurant is large and open with beautiful open beams that I always like. Once seated our server was very nice and took care of us well during our meal. The menu isn't as extensive as BJ's but that's not a bad thing either. One can get lost in a large menu and personally I like one smaller and hits all the points which Lazy Dogs does. The Ahi Poke severed on 4 crispy fried wontons was an excellent starter. Our main dishes were the Pot Roast French Dip, which was outstanding. I never thought to take moms pot roast and making a French dip out of it. So much better than thinly sliced beef. And the aujus, superb, it tasted like it was made from the Pot Roast itself and not some watered down beef boulon. Second dish was the hand formed Turkey Burger with avocado. Sorry, I love a good turkey burger and this version was good, not great but good. The Sweet Potato Tots on the other hand were some of the best I've ever had anywhere and I'd take them over a stack of fries any day. Overall I like Lazy Dogs for its open feeling good service and smaller precise menu. Four Stars for the establishment I'd give it Five if the Turkey Burger was a bit better."}
{"text":"3 of us Walked in around 930p and no one acknowledged us.Not even the bus boy. Stood around like idiots. Finally someone came over. I guess its a seat yourself place but it was hard to tell when there's no sign. I wanted a booth but was told all the servers went home so my 5' 1\" adult daughter who had a bad knee from a previous ACL surgery had to sit on one of those 6 foot high bar stool/chair (felt super high for short people) waitress was kind but poor thing was the only server for a bunch of other guests. Drinks came out quick. Food came shortly after. Food was delicious and nicely dressed. My husband got the meatloaf, I got the chicken pot pie. The crust was great, flakey and my daughter is a vegetarian and there was alot of veg options. The butter cake was good too. I think we would need to try this place at least one more time before we cut it off completely"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I love the Mojitos -- I order \"less sweet\".  Good burgers, salads, and appetizers.  It can get a bit noise, but such as it is.  Plus, the outdoor patio welcomes dogs!  C'mon, how cool is that!"}
{"text":"Mikey helped us. He is super friendly and helpful! The food here is always good. And the patio and menu they have for dogs is cool too! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time being at this restaurant we came for my boyfriend's birthday and the service was excellent if you have a chance to come by definitely ask for Shannon as your server. She is literally the best server I have ever had since moving here to Las Vegas 2 years ago. Shannon keep up the great work and thanks to you we will be seeing you real soon for happy hour!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this Lazy Dog! Really friendly bartenders/servers, consistent service, and a great happy hour. Andrea is awesome!"}
{"text":"We avoided our wait time by sitting at the high tops near the bar and got served right away!!! 

They have a great \"light\" menu where everything is under 550 calories and still tastes delicious!!!

You can sit outside and bring your dog to dine with you... if that's your thing. 

Their brand beer was just ok, not the best. But you do get a mini 6 pack sampler to try them all. They are even labeled with little dog tags. Very cute. 

You can buy your Regal movie tickets there at a discounted price and do a movie after dinner! Perfect date night combo."}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is a fun place to visit and have a meal they are a wide range of food choices and whatever your in the mood for. They do have anything from pastas, steaks, seafood, sandwiches, etc. I have been there when it has been cooler out so I have not been outside yet, but I have been told its very dog friendly. I will have to try it out in the warmer months. Also a tip don't forget to get your mints on the way out, they are neat and interesting :-). When I went the two times here one time I had their Caesar Salad and man it was a big salad for one person but it was very tasteful and filling. Sometimes its hard to find a good salad at restaurants. Then the second time I tried their steak and it was the tastiest steak I have had in along time. The seasoning was tasteful and the mashed potatoes and broccoli was very well cooked and it was very presentable also I would recommend this place even if you don't have a pet to bring they have fun atmosphere its worth the try out!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new location. Let's just say if this was our first visit, we would NEVER go back! Starting with very poor access for my wife and her walker. You literally have to go down to the back of the bldg and back to access handicap ramp...handicap parking right out front, next to the stairs by front door.
Waitress was great. Atmopshere average, Cali location and Summerlin location much better.
Had to send her order back to be heated...my burger, asked for medium was more well done. Upon leaving, new guests received freebies for first visit and told to save room for a free dessert...wtf? To top off experience, as we walked in noticed they had a 4 \"A\" rating: but when exiting now have 3\" A's\" and a \" B\".
We will never return to this location, nor recommend it!"}
{"text":"Super yummy bar food type place!!!  My friend had the nachos and they didn't lack one bit of flavor!!  SSSOOOOO GOOD!!!  And my Chinese dish was the same!!  So so good!!!  We will be back the next time I'm in town!  Super fun place and it looked like it would be packed all the time!  Looks like it would be good for football as well!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. No wait for happy hour and Jen R was such an attentive server. So friendly. Then, supposedly we had to wait longer than expected for one of or dishes, which I didn't really notice, and they took $20 off our bill! We didn't even ask for it! I'm happy to say I will be coming back and my martini was perfect. Yay!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Food was good, like the concept but nothing that wowed me. Will probably be back, but there's better restaurants at downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"Second time here w/in 2 days! That should say plenty, as I am quite selective with what I eat. Ordered the veggie lasagna the first time around and enjoyed it very much. Keep in mind though, it takes about 18-20 minutes to bake, as all their food is made from scratch! For starters, we ordered the hummus trio. All in all, the food was delish!! Today, I am here for lunch. Didn't realize they had an awesome selection for brunch as well. Brunch drinks start at ONLY $5! For food, going to order one of the lunch specials, sweet & spicy noodle bowl. Stay tuned for my reviews of those!"}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars if they had a changing table in the men's room (it's 2018! You can't be 'good for kids' if a dad can't bring their kiddo out and change them). Food is great, tons of options, great service, great patio."}
{"text":"Time of arrival: around 18:20
Seated: around 19:20
Orders: around 19:35-40
Appetizer out: 19:50
Entrees out: 20:45
Out the door: 21:39
So me and the family came out to give this spot a try based on the reviews. Initially a 40-50 minute wait for a Friday night and no same day reservations. Turned out to be an almost 60 minute wait. Not many places I have been to which does not offer same day reservations. Server was friendly and took our orders within 15 minutes of being seated. Here is where the fun begins. 7 adults placed 7 entrees with 7 drinks, 2 starters, and 1 appetizer. The appetizer came out surprisingly fast. Brother in law ordered a salad and mother in law ordered the tortilla soup. Both starters only came out only when all the entrees came out at the surprising speed of ONE HOUR LATER!!! Salad had the wrong dressing and soup had to be put in a to-go container. Manager came to explain that the kitchen staff was overwhelmed... \"OVERWHELMED\"!!! Hahahahah having worked in the industry when I was younger, overwhelmed was never a valid excuse ESPECIALLY when it takes one hour to pump out 7 entrees. However, meals were decent and management comped us with free desserts as an apology. Main focal point: Hire a competent kitchen staff who can pump out the meals on the menu in a timely manner. Oh and to anybody who chooses to bring their infants, word of advice: BRING HEARING PROTECTION AND A MINIMAL OF THREE FEEDING BOTTLES!!!"}
{"text":"Lazy Dog is a great place for wings and beer and the bartender Andrea is really friendly and gives great service."}
{"text":"This is a 5-star review. This chain restaurant deserves the 5-stars. Here's why:

*) Obviously a good training program implemented by management that encourages team work and employee engagement.
*) Most every employee seemed motivated, dressed in appropriate attire uniformly, appeared to have a heart rate above 90 (hard working!), and was pleasant and understandable .
*) Variety and quality and portion size of food and drink was acceptable for the price, served promptly (correct temperature...hot foods hot, cold foods cold, etc), drinks refilled/reordered with regularity, desserts were solicited, etc.
*) Well stocked bar with premium liquor and very large selection of wine and beers and custom, unique non-alcoholic drinks (and gambling)

Those of you who do not like this place are more than welcome to abandon the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area because this restaurant is the epitome of the culinary scene in Las Vegas: strong employee motivation, good price, good quality, plenty of space for large groups and throngs and throngs of small group... plus a dog-friendly patio and dog- friendly menu. 

Delivery through third-party apps available."}
{"text":"Love it fantastic restaurant great service and food is fantastic as always. I like the seasonal menu and the prompt service. Brussels Sprouts are awesome they certainly don't taste like the ones mom cooked. Caramelized onions and secret sauce."}
{"text":"My first and most likely only experience at this place is only a 3 star because of the manager saving the day. I will break it down here:

Arrived and it was pretty busy, noticed small table in the bar area and was told we could take it, PERFECT, no wait. Our waiter was on us right away, drinks ordered quickly and then it all fell apart. We weren't ready to order, so we asked for a couple more minutes. After about 15 minutes I finally asked my wife if she had seen our waiter, he was completely gone. I don't know if he had a smoke break or was helping in the main dining area but we was gone. We asked another employee if we could order and he said yes and disappeared, I assume to find our waiter.

Twenty minutes, we finally order, and a water re-fill. Then it's another waiting game, food took another 25-30 minutes and no check in from the waiter. We track down our waiter to inquire about our food and he says he will check. He shows up a couple minutes later, \"Just Finished\" he says, we begin to eat our food. COLD! At this point I had had it, I didn't care, we had been there for over an hour I knew we wouldn't see our waiter again, empty water glass, so we ate.

30 Minutes for two cold sandwiches. Grilled Cheese and Pot Roast Dip. Grilled Cheese was nothing special, my wife said it was okay. The Pot Roast Dip had very little meat and the onions were super sweet. The bread was good but overpowered all the other flavors, except the sweet onions. I told the waiter it was cold when he finally did come to see us, his reply \"I wish you would have told me I could have done something about that.\" How can I tell you when we only see you every 25 minutes?

This was a one star experience but it turns out the waiter did let his manager know the food was cold, so I guess he did do something. I'm sure he didn't mention that my food sat in the window and this is the only reason why the french fries were cold and the sandwich lukewarm at best. The manager did apologize covered the cost of my sandwich and comped a free desert. I appreciate the manager quickly coming to us and apologizing more than the comped food, but I appreciate that gesture as well. 

Overall poor experience: Poor food, poor service, but nice manager. I liked the waiter when he was with us, I just wish he checked in on us more."}
{"text":"Just your average food place. Had a burger. It was just average. Wife's dish was average as well."}
{"text":"Was In The Area And Decided To Stop In. Matthew Was Our Server And He Was Amazing. Gave Us Free Strawberry Butter-cake (Which Was Amazing ) For My Birthday. The Prices Aren't High And You Get A Lot Of Food Back! Would Go Back And Would Recommend It Yo Others"}
{"text":"Omg... is this dog food?? The food here is so bad.. its like McDonalds but bigger portions, more options, and with dogs... 

If you like the food here, you literally have no taste and should live off of grocery store dog food. 

But the locations are good"}
{"text":"I Enjoyed everything about this place. Great patio, delicious food and close to home! Sadly the Hubs almost died from too much hot spice on his burger BUT they took it off the bill and made it right. Will go back in patio weather for sure! Love seeing all the pups too."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. Outside had a spot for pets. Nice portions and so very fresh. Pot roast sandwich just melted in your mouth. Lots to chose from on the menu. Our server Nicole was great! Would definitely go back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. It's hard to believe this place just opened. They were well staffed and the service was flawless. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice place. 
All the things I want when I dine out 
& all the reason to come back"}
{"text":"This place is the best. We went on a busy night and there was about a twenty minute wait, but after we were seated our waiter was very attentive, nice and charming. 

The tortilla soup is a must have.

I got the chicken Parmesan, pretty tasty. The first time I ordered with white sauce but I didn't like it so I sent it back for the regular tomato sauce. The waiter didn't mind this at all and he was super nice about it. Creme brulee for dessert, also delicious. The drinks are an interesting, flavorful and delicious mixture. I would totally recommend to a friend. Can't wait to go back and try the butter cake that everyone raves about."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times both for lunch and dinner. It could get busy. Specially on the weekends but they do a good job on cutting down the wait time because the restaurant is pretty spacious and has plenty of seating.

The restaurant has a bar-type ambience but it's not too loud, just right. They have an outdoor seating if you want to bring your four legged friends.

The first still you will notice is the menu. The menu is really extensive, there are so many choices. They have American,Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and many more. It could get overwhelming trying to choose from such a large menu. 

The food is good, the service was kind of slow. We had a 9:30 movie time and we sat at 7:15 and we didn't get served fast enough and the food came out too slow that we didn't have time to finish our food. 

But overall, I know the restaurant business can get pretty busy and chaotic so it's not a big deal.

Would visit again."}
{"text":"First time here and we were very impressed. Our server, Reagan, was excellent and attentive. The food was quite good but the service and friendly atmosphere alone are sufficient reasons to come. The trout could've been larger but otherwise happy that we came here."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST!!!  Tony the manager went above and beyond the other night when we were here! My husbands burger didn't come out right and so we just asked if the could fix it then the manager came over and told us it would be taken care of right away and offered free desert. The dessert we wanted was only on the breakfast menu and so the manager said not a problem and went back and personally made us our berry pancakes. Ever person in this place goes above and beyond and if your going to Vegas stop at this place!! You won't regret it! We are from Phoenix and we stop here every time we come to Vegas now!!"}
{"text":"Came here and tried the food for the VERY first time & absolutely loved everything about it! I ordered the chipotle chicken cheese quesadillas for the appetizer (My favorite!!) & the grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. I don't know what was up with my cheese craving that day.

The host Idalis was so lovely . She was so nice and greeted me when i walked in . Everyone here are really friendly and polite . Food didn't take that long either . I made sure to tip my waitress Ashley for her kind and fast service.

Lazy dog is definitely one of my go to spots when I'm hungry and in the area. The tables are all very nice and clean including the building. Theres a clean bar besides the restaurant & a deck for guests to sit outside ."}
{"text":"This place was great! I had some of their house brews and the Ahi Poke from their appetizer menu and it was delicious! The Poke was a little different than your normal poke flavor. They pickle Cucumbers and radishes and serve it in a mason jar with a side of the wonton \"chips\". The house brews were really good as well. This place is perfect for just sitting at the bar or getting a table and taking the family. The outdoor patio area allows people to take their dogs and they even offer a small dog menu!! Fun place for sure."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service really slow. We asked for ketchup and they forgot about it, so had to grab it from adjacent table. We asked three times to clear the table to have desserts and in the end we gave up on dessert as the table was still not cleared. 
Won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I go here all the time. The atmosphere is great, it's convenient, and the food is normally spot on. The only down fall is a number of times the service has not been top notch. It normally starts off well but goes down by the end. It's still worth the visit just don't be surprised if your server isn't the best."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and so far it's been my favorite brunch place in town (available until 2pm). $15 pitcher of sangria... $5 mimosa or peach bellini... I'm in brunch heaven! *When you check in you can try out their awesome cajun fries which is super crispy.*

Fresh Strawberry French Toast
3 pieces of toasted bread, whipped cream, strawberry compote -- I really enjoyed this dish. It wasn't too heavy or too sweet.

Breakfast Burger
Beef patty, bacon, sunny side up egg, crispy hash browns, cheddar, homemade sauce and fries -- this is my favorite of all. The burger was cooked to my liking, the egg was perfect, and the flavor was so yummy.

Country Chicken & Biscuit
Crispy fried chicken, chicken sausage, two sunny side up eggs & a house made buttermilk biscuit, cajun gravy / spiced maple syrup -- never had biscuits like this! Super crispy chicken and is delicious with the sauce.

Housemade Carnitas & Tater Tot Hash
Braised pork shoulder, two poached eggs, country potatoes, sweet potato tater tots, roasted bell peppers, onions, American cheese, roasted poblano pepper sauce, fresh cilantro -- holy crap, just the description of this dish made my mouth water... the green sauce is to die for! One of my favorites. HIGHLY recommend!

Overall, our service was great. Busy both times but we were sat fairly quickly. They have patio seating and allow your furry loved ones to join you!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Always a super friendly staff, and I will continue to return to this location."}
{"text":"Let me make my disclaimer up front. My mother loved this place. Her food was great and she enjoyed watching all of the other dogs. She has been raving about it since we left. I, however, had a different experience. We ate outside and didn't bring dogs and it was nice watching everyone else with their dogs there. The service was great as well. I ordered a Wild Blueberry with Lemmon cocktail and sent it back. Normally I make due with the choices I make but this drink was all syrup and overwhelmingly sweet. I had the other people at my table taste it to make sure I wasn't being too particular and they agreed it was bad. The waitress was great in taking in back and getting me a different drink. I didn't ask but she removed it from the receipt as well. Second cocktail, a greyhound variety, much much better. I ordered the cheesy eggs and avocado toast with hashbrowns. When my plate arrived I was both perplexed and pleased. The toast looked amazing, the eggs ok, but the hashbrown was a balled up fist of the shredded potatoes thrown in the deep fryer. I took the first bite of the toast and it was great. The bread was slightly charred on top and it was chewy and crunchy. That was the last good taste. The second bite clued me in to the salt crust. The bottom of the toast had a salt crust on the entire bottom of it. I tried to scrape it off to salvage it but it didn't make much difference. The eggs were runny and an immediate turn off. I will not come here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. The dog feature it neat, that is all."}
{"text":"I have known about Lazy Dog from back when I lived in California, but never got around to trying it. The husband and I were shopping at Downtown Summerlin on Mother's Day, and although we figured this place would be crowded, we decided to walk here and find out how long the wait was. 45-55 minutes. No thank you. Came back a week later and as we were parking, I was afraid the wait would be long again. The parking lot was packed for some reason and a lot of people were waiting outside. But I guess people were just hanging out. We walked in and hostess seated us at a booth right away. 

Our server was attentive, but I didn't feel like he was too friendly. A manager also stopped by our table to ask how everything was going. The food was delicious! I ordered the Hawaiian Sticky Ribs, which was cooked perfectly and I loved the generous amount of sauce that was on it. Juicy and full of flavor to the bone! Honestly, I don't like to order ribs too often because most places never prepare them right. It annoys me when they are dry and barely have sauce on them. It also came with Umami Fries, which had a kick to it, but it was good. I could have done without the asian slaw on the plate, which was really soggy and bland. My husband ordered the Country Chicken and Biscuit, which is part of their weekend brunch menu. I didn't try it, but he said that it was one of the best chicken and biscuit dishes that he had. We didn't leave any room for dessert, but definitely next time because the Butter Cake does look good!

I would like to come back again to try different dishes. I like the wide variety of food that they have to offer. Also think its cool that you can bring your dogs to dine with you on the patio, along with a dog menu!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Have been here several times and the food and drinks are delicious. Also love having a place nearby that has a huge dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"From the moment I sat at the bar I was unimpressed with this place. It was 4pm on a Sunday. So it wasn't busy and it was too slow. I must have sat at the bar for 10 minutes before the bartender greeted me. Didn't catch her name but she was an Asian female. I asked her for a food & drink menu and she never bothered to come back over and take my order. Ridiculous. So I moved to a table hoping to get some service. My friends came, went spend about  $200 on food and drinks between the 4 of us. The food was blah (nachos, hummus, etc)... the drinks were waaaay watered down (we tried several different ones on the menu). Our waitress was ok, nothing special, nothing memorable. I just think there's so many other good places to go in this area with better food and service.  Big disappointment :(."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. We came in for dinner around 6:30 and chose one of the hightop tables near the bar. The server (Fin) was quick to greet us and very pleasant. My 11 year old son was with me and somehow started talking to one of the bartenders (Drea). He's totally a ladies man so I shouldn't be surprised!! Haha!  She came from behind the bar and was chatting it up with him. She totally entertained him and I thought it was pretty cool. She went out of her way to make sure he had a good time. And it wasn't for the tip, she wasn't even our server. Fin was great too. She explained everything we asked about on the menu and was patient with us when we couldn't decide. (The menu has SO much to choose from!). The food was out quickly and I had the grilled cheese (maybe the best ever) with Cajun fries (so yummy). My son had chicken fingers. He said they were delicious and they looked like they had been freshly breaded. The manager (I didn't get her name, taller with dark, curly hair) checked on us twice as well. 
Bottom line. Food is great. Kitchen was fast and they really \"get\" great customer service. We'll be back for sure. Next time we'll bring the fur babies and try the patio!!"}
{"text":"We were at Lazy Dog yesterday, the food was excellent, but the best part of the evening was our server Alejandro! He guided us through the menu and was very knowledgeable about all of our alcoholic options. Overall he was very entertaining and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I want to give this location more stars, but the service here is so inconsistent. 

I love the patio area with the fire pit. I bring my little diva with me and she enjoys seeing the other doggies. The dog menu is simple and fairly priced. I like coming here on a nice night to take out my pup. 

Most times, the service is speedy and efficient. But on more than a few occasions, we've had to wait longer than necessary for something as simple as a water refill. I feel that there isn't much coverage for servers on the patio. It always seems like they're running around, overworked. I come here when I'm not in a hurry. 

Anyways, the food and drinks are fine. Nothing too outstanding. Hopefully the service improves, or I'll have to give the summerlin location a try."}
{"text":"Came here to check it out. It was a bonus that it was late night happy hour (9pm-close).  We sat at the bar. We were greeted by Daniel! He was AMAZING!!! He had the best suggestions on the beers and food! We had the spicy nuggets, calamari, and hummus. We will definitely be back! (Hopefully when Daniel is working!!)"}
{"text":"I was happy that a restaurant serves dogs too. My first time coming here I had the salad, it was saturated in balsamic vinegar that it was  hard to eat it. I left it alone because it was my dogs birthday. Had another birthday for my other dog lastnight. We went and I ordered the Mushroom Burger. Not bad. It was edible. my girlfriend had the fish tacos. I had a bite of hers and it was so dry and to be honest nasty. I wanted her to give it back but she did not want to cause a scene. 

The staff were very friendly. I truly am bummed out that this company did not meet the grade for us. Maybe in the future."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with this place after my initial visit for lunch, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they had just opened and things would improve. I was wrong. 

I came with a group of coworkers for lunch and despite making a reservation well in advance they had nothing prepared for us so we were left to wait for the table to be set up which took about 15 minutes. We had a limited time for lunch so we were nervous about this slow start. 

Finally seated slow service plagued the meal. Our server was nice but given that they assigned her our entire table of twelve along with a few surrounding tables. A little too much for her to handle so although we understood she was trying her best we needed to address the issue and hopefully get some help to expedite our meal. After speaking with the manager we noticed many more servers and bussers helping out with refills and bringing out the food. This should have happened before we asked but we appreciated the effort. 

The food was bland and boring as on my previous visit and along with all the service issues, I really don't see any need to return."}
{"text":"Stopped on Saturday for a bite only to have a pleasant choice of brunch.  On our arrival the hostess was very pleasant and upbeat.  Our server Daniel was attentive, funny, helpful and added to our enjoyable brunch. Ask for him!  
The coffee was very tasty and hot. The staff made sure we had plenty of refills.  Our breakfast was excellent and recommended by Daniel to us. I am glad we took his advice.  The foot was fun if taste. The atmosphere is very nice. There was upbeat overhead music, not too loud but enjoyable. We saw plenty of burgers coming out of the kitchen and look forward to our return"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Lazy Dog in downtown summerlin and that will probably continue to be the only one I go. 
The two employees I spoke with at this location had a bad attitude.
The first one being the blonde girl in the front. It seemed like I was bothering her by checking in for a table.

Then our waitress again just had a bad attitude. Every time we needed something we had to wave her down. Never got a refill on drinks. 

I don't know if it was because it was Saturday and they'd rather be else where, but their attitudes sucked."}
{"text":"Food here is really good. They also strictly abide by health code involving visiting canines. Much appreciated with being allergic to dogs."}
{"text":"Paula is awesome.  Be sure to ask to be seated in her section. She is courteous, kind, and consistently checking in without being overbearing.  No empty cups at this table."}
{"text":"Went there for pre-birthday celebrations. Happy Hour is always the best IMO We always try everything! The Sangria is so good too. I recommend a pitcher! My favorite is the Dirty Dog! Plus I love that we can bring Gigi (our adorable chihuahua)! Great to charge our Tesla while eating too!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had dinner at Lazy Dog last Thursday and while the food was good (as always) the best part of our dinning experience was our waitress, Katrina! Since, my friends and I had not seen each other in a long time, we were more focused on catching up then ordering. Instead of being irritated with having to come back to our table multiple times for our order, she was understanding and patient with us. She never once rushed us during the meal, which was longer then most people around us. Moreover, we had an active 1 year old with us and Katrina was extremely thoughtful to her needs throughout out the meal! We will definitely be back to Lazy Dog because of her excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Andrea the bartender is the best! She is fast, efficient, funny, and always smiling!!!"}
{"text":"Will be going back for sure great food and atmosphere. And you can bring your dog they have a special menu and all. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't our fav, the Hawaiian ahi poke was ok, however per my son the pizza taste like school pizza[Junk]. The service is ok & it's super loud. Not a place we'll be returning."}
