{"text":"This is a great take-away place! Friendly, fast and fresh! It may not be top Chinese dining but it beats a couple other Chinese places in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place for the first time and definitely for the last time. The ginger beef was very hard and tasted like it was cooked a day ago. The black bean chicken hardly had any chicken. It was filled with onion drenched in sauce, carrots and peppers. The Cantonese chow mein was all noodle. The spring roll was greasy and soggy. Portion sizes were tiny, paid $40 for my order!!! The restaurant it self is dirty, the glass front door needs a good cleaning. On top of that, my stomach wasn't feeling well after I had this \"food\". Stay away!!! This place is gross!"}
{"text":"Alway great quality and service. From take out to dinning in we have never had any problems."}
{"text":"Not much atmosphere to eat in, but the take out is very good, especially compared to anything else from Riverbend to Douglas Glen. I order take out there regularly."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered four items from Douglas Peking Express which took an hour for delivery, and arrived around 8pm. Their items are as follows: 1. Two spring rolls (which have earned the star of the review). 2. Mushroom Fried Rice (incredibly bland, seriously, like eating air.) 3. Mushrooms and Broccoli (very greasy), 4. Cantonese noodles with vegetables (this dish had about 1/4 cup of oil separated from the sauce.  The noodles were partially cooked, and as my husband and I do not eat meat, so the chicken we received in our noodle dish was an unwelcomed addition.  This food was overly greasy (I've never had greasier Chinese food, I felt like I should ring out the noodles like you would a dishcloth).  We couldn't even stomach the leftovers, unfortunately we tossed them.  I cannot speak to anything other than the four items we ordered but I would highly recommend you avoid ordering those items (except for the spring rolls, they were a solid 7/10). Lastly, the takeout bag was saturated in sauce which leaked from the container when it arrived."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for Singapore Noodles. They are a tad greasy and a bit too much salt, but still a solid takeout option on days I don't feel like cooking. Fast and consistent."}
{"text":"Horrible! No meat in the special Chow mein . Greasy and very disappointed. Will Never go back. Too many way better places!"}
