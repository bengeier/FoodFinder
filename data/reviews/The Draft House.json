{"text":"Friendly staff, appreciated that they turned on the Raiders game for me. Cheap pitchers and reasonably priced Irish coffees. Loads of tv screens so perfect for all sporting occasions. The only downfall is the bathroom is far away but you get over that. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"A pretty unassuming bar near Yonge and Bloor. I've been here quite a few times since I frequent in this area, and have been accustomed to their daily drink/food specials.   Sun/Mon/Tues they have half price wings, and almost everyday they have $10 pitchers of Canadian, $12 mini pitchers, and some sort of liquor deal. Really good value!  For whatever reason I'm a big fan of their clam chowder soup. It's not the traditional thick and creamy kind, but tasty none the less and is a gigantic portion. Fries here are also a good appetizer to share when you're downing some drinks.  All in all, it's a small venue (giving an almost \"neighborhood\" bar feel), but the friendly waitresses and on-demand touchscreen jukebox will ensure you have a great time."}
{"text":"Only good thing about it is the price of beer... food was sad.. ambience was sad.. many better places nearby"}
{"text":"Place is relatively clean.  Very clean for Yonge street standards.  The beer was cold, the wife said the diet Pepsi was good.  I had the burger.  She had the all day breakfast.  The burger was very tasty and juicy. The lettuce in the burger was fresh.  The fries were great. The wife said the all day breakfast was very good.  The waitress was quick and friendly.  Better, cleaner decor and maybe a theme would make this place a 5"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, whatever game that may be (and if the sport you want to watch is not on, ask and they'll change the channel for you) Cheap domestic pitchers and cheap shots specials. The burger and fries are delicious - juicy burger and comes with a mountain of fries. Their wings are also very yummy and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Raptorsget knocked out of the playoffs (boo)  Good atmosphere for the game, not too busy and was able to get a booth. Food was really good and you got a hell of a lot for what you're paying. Pints are pretty cheap for this area too.  Also fell in love with the asian server working there! Will be back to try get her number and if that fails then more cheap food/drink will be had!"}
{"text":"The bartender decided to talk to someone at the bar instead of acknowledging us until she was finished her conversation. We left and we were given attitude by her. Stay away."}
{"text":"Beware: this bar has cockroaches!! We came in to try the bar, ordered a couple of drinks and were contemplating ordering food until we saw a cockroach crawling all over the table. The waitresses asked us if we wanted to move, which we did. The drinks we ordered were on the house, which was great, but still... Roaches!"}
{"text":"They have beer but so do countless other better bars in the area. Go across the street to The Artful Dodger and immediately everything improves."}
{"text":"Came here a long while back but I couldn't remember the name until I was passed it on Yonge recently so I'm posting this now.     Initially we were supposed to go to Bar Volo but it was packed so we walked across the street and stepped in here. This place is DIRTY. I immediately noticed and started talking about it with my friends once we sat down. The servers must have heard me, because they brought my drink out with a chewed up straw. I have a picture of it on my old phone but I'm too lazy to dig for it and upload it. We ordered burgers, which were mediocre. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Nice new addition to dt here. It's a tiny little spot with limited seating. They have a selection of bar spots and side booths which is nice. Selection of beer is pretty good and for cocktails. Service was friendly and pretty quick and the prices were very fair!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this new sports bar on Yonge Street. Typical of the area, the space is narrow and deep, but they've done a very good job incorporating the bar, tables, booths and all the requisite big screen TVs. It's a pretty cozy spot to knock back a few pints.  They have a house beer that's under $5 a pint and standard pints all seem to be around $6. I wasn't blown away by the house beer, but this place gets an extra star for having affordable pints in this neighbourhood. I hope this doesn't change!  The menu has a few thai and indian dishes mixed in with the usual pub fare. I just had the burger, but it was very juicy and well prepared. I'm judging the food by sports bar standards here, so don't expect fine dining or anything though.  The service was friendly, and I plan to return."}
{"text":"This place should be a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Somebody has invested a fair amount of money in renovating the place, installing a multitude of big screen TVs.  The prices for beer are reasonable.    The kitchen serves up some tasty dishes at reasonable prices.    On the downside, there is an amateurish quality to the place.. A few times, when I was in there, I saw dirt and litter on the floor with none of the staff paying any attention to it.    They appear have a high turnover in waitresses. One of them is quite nice and attentive to customers.   Other waitresses are rude and indifferent.  There is a serious problem with discipline here.  The staff is generally not professional or businesslike at all.  This place has potential, however management need to assert itself, kick some butt and infuse more professionalism."}
{"text":"Very very non descript pub. Lots of screens and cheap pitchers of Canadian.  Ambiance and service were fine. Nothing really to report. I suppose it's a decent option on Yonge Street to grab a pint. Dosent have the usual characters (both good and bad) that one finds in Yonge Street drinking holes."}
{"text":"Went there for a second time and the service sucked as much as the first. Don't give your money to this establishment, the servers are horrendous."}
{"text":"Cheap pitchers of domestic beer and pretty cool atmosphere! Lots of tv's displaying primetime sports and good beats from the jukebox. Chill place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after work ~ 7:00pm.   The bar has an overall grimy, haphazard feel to it as though little thought or care was put into the place, e.x., crappy old mismatched tables (not in the hipster kind of way), dirty floors and bathroom (if you can find it) and amateur staff.  The bartender took forever to acknowledge me waiting at the bar even though there were only 4 other people sitting at the bar. That should have tipped me off.  Tried their house beer expecting something equivalent to a Coors or Canadian (i.e, nothing special) but was disappointed.  Our server who left midway through the night got our order wrong and forgot one of our group's orders (4 guys at a table = 3 entrees...?). Got hot wings which were nothing special...  We also had to tell the server to change the channels to get the NHL/NBA playoff games on! If you are a sports bar know what sports are on!  Don't waste your time. I will not be back.  Alternate options in the area: Hoops for sports, Bar Volo for beer, Hue's for food."}
{"text":"Went here a few times with some friends. Great staff and I enjoyed their Friday night club scene!! Definitely worth the trip downtown!"}
{"text":"If your looking for cheap domestic beers and a good place to watch sporting events, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Went here late on a Saturday night with some friends spontaneously. It was dim, but nice with t.v's playing sports. Not so much interested in watching sports while drinking so it was nice the volume wasn't loud or anything. The people working there were kind and friendly. The drinks were great had j√§ger bombs for $6. Beer was cheap too. Overall great place to hang and drink with friends in that area. Will likely be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were bar hopping and ended up here last night. We got a pitcher of Canadian for $13, pretty good deal. The service was nice and the girl was attentive. All the food coming out to be served to people smelled amazing but we didn't eat anything. the washrooms are in the basement down a long hall which was  kinda trippy. They were clean which is a huge plus downtown"}
{"text":"The pint house is a cute little bar. They had a few good beers on draught, an Okanogan beer, beaus, I think millstreet and the standard big ones. The food looked good, there was ample seating,  despite it being such a small and narrow space.  Tons of t.v.s, definitely a place to catch the game. Friendly staff too. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great servers and bartenders, great deals on drinks and their food is truly awesome  compared to other bars in the area. Wings are a must try. This is def my favourite place to come to for that cold beer and munchie after work."}
{"text":"Pint House is what a bar would look like if you put the least amount of effort into designing a bar. That said, the nachos are pretty good. Three stars."}
{"text":"I mean.... it's cheap, it's got great atmosphere (so rowdy and lively during games), it's open until 2 am, and the staff is lovely. It's not a classy, uptight joint- it's literally just a basic sports bar.   They ID you when you order, and the washrooms are downstairs in the basement. They also serve food, but I honestly can't remember how it tastes anymore...   You should drop by after you've already had a few shots elsewhere, really. I have fond memories at the pint house so that might also be the reason for my pretty high rating."}
{"text":"Considering this place is called The Pint House they didn't have a lot of good beer options. It was a fine sports bar but nothing special. Food was the usual sports bar fare. The spring rolls I ordered were fine, reminded me of Swiss Chalet a bit. Meh."}
{"text":"Interesting little spot. I was walking around yonge street looking for somewhere to watch the NFL game, and came across this bar. Not the biggest place but perfect for a some football watching. The beers were priced decently, i believe about 5 dollars for a bud tallboy. I order the chick strips and i'll say those were some hard fried chicken tenders. I'd advise you to try something else if you are hungry. Bartender was funny and outgoing which is always nice."}
{"text":"Pitcher of Canadian $12.99. Food is basic. Priced appropriately. Service was one bartender that took care of the floor too. She was all smiles and efficient.   There are lots of screens for viewing sports but it is a rather narrow establishment. On my visit the European Cup was on. Afternoon games.  TV's all tuned in. Large screen at the front tuned in. Sound system was good.   Front window is garage style and opens up. Washrooms downstairs along a long hallway but clean and functional.    I will choose this place again for watching a sporting event for sure."}
{"text":"Cheddar on a smokey, delicious 8oz patty with quality bacon. Ask for half the blue cheese as it's super-fresh and sweet, sweet bacon. Sounds expensive but worth your while! We picked the booth towards the back that's in front of the projector plus a $12 pitcher of House Lager (alright-kind-of-meh). It's also a nice dark wood bar with friendly staff. H Burger, beer and hockey date; I wish I could say the same about the Leafs but this place is a winner!"}
