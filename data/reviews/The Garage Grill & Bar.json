{"text":"so somebody spent a lot of scrilla remodeling this place, great theme decor, definitely brighter inside than it used to be. Then it would appear they hired the same a-holes who ran it into the ground. We walked in, NOBODY greeted us, NOBODY even acknowledged that we existed. we sat ourselves at a table, after several minutes, my husband went to the bar, about 10 feet from our table and said \"do you have any servers on?\" The bartender said \"yeah i saw you and I already told her she had a table, so i guess she'll be up here in a minute.\" Really? Three bartenders on, 5 bar guests and nobody could stop to help us. I guess the aging barmaids and the extremely disheveled male bartender did not want to stop schmoozing the five rumplestiltskins nursing cheap draft beers to wait on us.  Finally here comes our waitress, at least we assumed she was our waitress, she was wearing nothing to indicate that she worked there, she didnt introduce herself, didn't talk to us about the menu...nothing about her, except the note pad and apron to let us know she wasn't just someone off the street.  We said, \"we have been here for a while,\" to which she replied \"yeah well I was doing stuff in the back.\" she seemed so angry about us being there, that we left, so full of attitude, none of it positive.  I will never go back. I have worked in every aspect of the restaurant business for the past 22 years and I work too hard taking care of my customers to earn my money, to give a red cent to someone who talks to me like I am garbage."}
{"text":"First time visit to The Garage since it opened. What a difference from the previous restaurant Purple Shamrock which was a dump and very filthy inside to this bright and shiny eatery. The decor is awesome a lot of chrome and very clean. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The food was really good but have to say the waitress we had was not. She was very slow and chatting a lot with other people than paying attention to her tables.  The other waitress that was on was very attentive to her tables. I will definitely visit again as the food was great but if I get lousy service again it will be my last. I give this establishment  5 stars for the food but had to rate this 2 stars for the service."}
