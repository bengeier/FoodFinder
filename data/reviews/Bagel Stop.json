{"text":"This is my go-to in the morning. Every day, a sesame bagel with butter and a medium coffee.  This sounds strange but the coffee here is probably better than the gourmet placed even though it's a \"do it yourself\" style. I recommend the Irish cream.  The ladies behind the counter make quick work even though the lineups get long. In particular they recognize me and we exchange pleasantries while they set up my bagel - the woman who prepares everything does not even ask any more, it's more like she gives me a look and I nod, and then I get what I want.  The bagels are sweet, tasty. Montreal style bagels are better but these do the trick. I will say that while tasty, they are heavy and I often feel like I have eaten a donut for breakfast after having one. That might be more me than the bagel stop though, and as it is I like the whole experience. If you work in commerce court, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Didn't like the way they handled the bagels.  They touched bacon and with the same gloves on,  we're making cream cheese bagels..  Being a vegetarian, it bothered me .. Never coming back here"}
{"text":"Pretty good for the money. I ordered the morning special and it was delicious. The staff are not really talkative but I can't complain."}
