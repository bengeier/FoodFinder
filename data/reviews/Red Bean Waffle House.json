{"text":"Stopped by around 8:30pm, 2 Saturdays ago with 3 friends, for some dessert after having an early dinner nearby. Been meaning to drop by since I first saw reviews about this place. This store is opened by the same people from Kim's a la cart on Yonge & Finch. I'm so excited about this place opening because that means I no longer have to find parking on Yonge to get those fishie waffles anymore. There's a huge parking lot, but with so many other restaurant in the same plaza it can be kind of hard to find parking during busier lunch/dinner hours. This place closes way earlier than the cart though at 9pm, so that's one con.  There are more sweets options here then at the food cart, but I think maybe less savoury options. Not a problem for me, since 90% of the time I'm at the cart it's for the fishie waffles anyways. Here they not only have the traditional red bean fish waffles, but the nutella fish waffles as well. Well I haven't been to the cart in almost a year so, not sure if they have that there now as well.  Red Bean Waffles were $1 for 1 or $5 for 6. So of course I got the 6 pcs. Kind of wished they had the $2.50 for 3 like at the cart, cause that would have been the perfect portion for me. No matter though, I had half with the family and then toasted the rest in the oven the next day and they were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside again. I like that the red bean filling isn't too sweet, I am not a big fan of red bean, but I will eat these fishies anyday.   The Nutella Waffles are $5 for 4. We really wanted to try them as well, since my friends loves nutella a lot. They only sell them in 4s, but for some reason there was only 3 left. Since the store was closing soon, they just gave us the 3 for free. So nice of them! And it was so good! It was not bursting with nutella though like my friends had hoped, but good none the less. I definitely would get this again.  We also wanted to try the nutella pancakes too, but they weren't making anymore since they were getting ready to close up already. Ahh next time I will be back to try that pancake and get more of them fishies!"}
{"text":"Good value. There are red beans in the waffle. My kids and I love it. Their ice creams are super good. It is a bit far from where I live. Definitely, will go back."}
{"text":"We shared the Pat bing soo.  Really fresh fruit.  Delicious and beautiful. The only thing missing I think was the condensed milk atop the shaved ice.  Not disappointed though, still yummy and refreshing considering today had a heat advisory"}
{"text":"I had their green tea and black sesame ice cream in the fish waffle cone. The green tea ice cream tastes like any other green tea ice cream that you can get at other places. The black sesame ice cream was interesting: you don't really taste the sesame when you first eat it, but you taste it in the after-taste. It's not very sweet so might not be something you want to choose if you're craving sweets. The fish waffle cone was great, really filling. I ate this after going to Kobi bbq next door and I was SOOO full."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because it's close to my work place. It's by the far some of the cutest food I've eaten in the area, but taste wise it's just alright.  Read bean waffle ice cream w/ black sesame (3.5/5): the cone is so cute. I got this and seriously didn't want to eat it haha. However, that aside the black sesame ice cream tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer a little too long so the flavour was faint and texture was very icy. The cone itself was hard in some spots so i found it wasn't as easy to eat as a traditional cone but the red bean at the bottom was a nice surprise.  Red bean waffles (3/5): It's hard to eat more than one because I found that my waffles were super greasy. The red bean inside isn't super sweet and the texture of the waffle itself was very soft, however it was hard to get over the greasy-ness. Unfortunately, I most likely won't be buying their red bean waffles again.  Cost (3/5): Fairly standard. I didn't think it was too expensive nor quite a deal as well.  Service (3.5/5): Like cost, it was standard. The person at the cash said hello, and non-nonchalantly took our order. I no complaints, but don't really have any compliments to offer either.   Ambiance (3.5/5): Not a big focus of this little shop. It's a basic counter with the pre-made fishy cones sitting on top. There's a table and counter top to sit at with basic furniture. The red bean waffle ice cream chart is a nice touch and I quite enjoyed the poster they have on their wall that says what kind of person you are based on how you eat the red bean waffle. Definitely cute.  Will probably come back if I'm up for trying another flavored ice cream (perhaps black sesame is not their best), but wouldn't recommend the red bean waffles cause of how greasy my experience was."}
{"text":"Tastes great for an amazing price.  i got the waffle with mango and coconut ice cream with actual coconut pieces inside! Only 6.20 which is actually pretty decent compared to a lot of the other dessert places ive been to. Will be back to try their other menu items"}
{"text":"This is my second time writing a review for the Red Bean Waffle House because somehow my review \"dissapeared\"... I saw this establishment recommended on BlogTO for their fish shaped waffle cones. I wanted to love this place so much and even drove out of the way for them. Unfortunately, when we arrived there we were highly disappointed. The establishment I believe is family owned and the restaurant itself is very small. The woman who works there wasn't very friendly. I only say this because we weren't greeted nor did she even look up at us when placing our order, and the boy was very quiet and had no expression.  We both ordered the Fish Shaped Waffle Cone with Black Sesame ice cream. When we finally received it, the cone was cold, dry and hard. You'd think it had gotten cold because of the ice cream but prior to arriving they had quite a few pre-made cones, and they were evidently sitting for quite awhile. Also, considering they're called the RED BEAN waffle house the red bean was almost virtually nonexistent with a miniscule amount hidden at the bottom of the cone. The desert was very difficult and hard to eat, in general because of the stale hard texture and it was very messy. The ice cream was mediocre at best but nothing spectacular. This desert is more for the aesthetics than anything. I would only reccomend this place if your looking for a cute Instagram or Snapchat photo. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money and get the Ice Cream Waffle cake from Pacific Mall or make the trip to Korea Town, Downtown. However, I guess it's worth a try for novelty and picture purpose, yet I personally will not reccomend or be coming back."}
{"text":"What a great treat! My best friend really wanted to try to place out so on our spontaneous food adventure, we stopped by.   What a great treat it was. We shared the red bean icecream waffle with black sesame and green tea icecream. It was so yummy! We also got two boxes of the original red bean waffle to bring home to our family. They loved it!   What makes the experience that much better is knowing this little place is run by a lovely family.   Will be back! Thanks again for the great experience :)"}
{"text":"I visited this place yesterday. It was not busy at all for a Thursday night. When I first walked in I was greeted by the lady at the front. There was 1 table in the whole place and a family of 4 was eating BingSoo. There's also 3 bar stools on the side where you can sit too, but it's really not very big.  I ordered a red bean fish ice cream with 2 scoops of green tea ice cream. The cost was $5 for the 1. They also have 3 other flavours that seem to be the premium ones that cost $5.50 for 2 scoops.   i waited for about 5 minutes and my order was up. I scarfed it down outside because there wasn't much room inside. It was very tasty. The only thing is i wish my fish was hotter, but then if the fish was hotter then the ice cream would melt faster. Not sure how i could win there.   I would definitely come back because the owners seemed friendly and the product that they're selling is ingenues whoever thought to open up the fish and stuff it with ice cream too?   Just a small tip: the plaza it is in is one way. so make sure you follow the signs!"}
{"text":"Great red bean Korean pancake.  Very convenient located in the plaza across Centerpoint mall.  In addition to the Korean pancake, they also have fish shaped waffles in red bean.  They even have green bean pancakes now.  I've got to try that someday.  Oh yea for summers, you can have fish shaped waffle with ice-cream,  I love those things :)  They have dumplings and squid patty.  Both are good as they defrost in microwave and cook it when you order.  Served hot and nice."}
{"text":"My heart was broken after experiencing Red Bean Waffle House.  When I saw it's grand opening, I had bookmarked it here on Yelp for hopes in the future for me to try it when I was in area because it's a bit of a drive for me.  Sadly, it wasn't worth the drive. Not worth it at all.   My only comparison to taiyaki treats is when they used to have that super delicious taiyaki stand at Galleria Supermarket. And I continually told myself that I would go for it again .... But Galleria had seemed to close it down. Though I haven't gone in a while, so maybe it's back?  I dropped by here at RB Waffle House, and it was just my fiance and I. It's a very cute, very homey small spot. I had gotten the taiyaki and my fiance got some nutella fried rice cake or something.  We were told 10 minutes, so we hung outside.  To my knowledge I thought i was getting a super fresh, super hot taiyaki treat off the waffle making machine. But nope ... Apparently they pre-make them, which you can view from the front, but in all honesty. I thought it was just for display to show people what they looked like, and the size of them. God how disappointed I was. So very very disappointed.  My fiance's Nutella rice cake thing seemed better, but it was very lackluster of the amount of Nutella in it. Which confused us to no end. Since both sides of the rice cake were very thick for what it exactly was.   In all honesty, I don't think I'd be willing to go back here. Friendly service, but it's just very ... Meh."}
{"text":"I love this sort of thing and they are relatively close to my house so I really wanted it to be a winner. We got the red bean ice cream and the black sesame ice cream, both in the fish waffle cone. The sesame ice cream was marginally fragrant but the red bean ice cream just tasted like sweet vanilla ice cream (it didn't have any fragrance). The waffle cones were undercooked inside and really dry and crunchy on the edges. The rainbow sprinkles on top added no value and just injected artificial food coloring to the already lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the green tea fish waffle $5. It looks appetizing. A bit smaller than I imagined it to be. Comes with 2 scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. The bottom of the cone has a bit of red bean in it.  I asked for a takeout box so I could take it home (it was winter so I rather eat it at home) however they wouldn't give me a box. I had to keep asking and tell them that I couldn't drive home with me having to hold onto it. The server finally gave me a cup in which half of it ripped already when I got into the car... It was a bit hard trying to transport it but I assume most people eat it outside right when they get it.  The ice cream was good but the cone itself was really hard which I was not expecting since I've had their fish cakes at their stand before. I think it was a bit stale too.  The bottom of the cone was good tho because of the red bean which made the cone more mushy.   I probably would not come again."}
{"text":"Came here twice now.  Got the red bean fish waffle $5 for 5.  Was fresh and still hot.  They have new flavors now too but it is more costly and can't get it as a package of 5.  I believe they have custard as the new flavor.  They sell a variety of other hot savory food and of course ice cream stuffed into a fish waffle.  It is too cold each time for ice cream but I will be back I summer to try it.  As it looks so good."}
{"text":"This place kept popping up on my yelp page, and I'm glad it did! For $5, you get your choice of select ice cream (can get 2 different flavours) packed in a red bean waffle shaped like a fish. For $6, there are some premium flavours like sesame ice cream. The green tea ice cream was smooth and rich in flavour. Paired with a crispy and sweet waffle, it was delicious! I'd come back for a treat here once in a while."}
{"text":"This place is super under-rated! They make their ice cream fresh and the flavours are so good. Favourites were: sesame and mango. Legit ingredients and none of the fillers / definitely not loaded with sugar. The red bean ice cream waffles were filled to the brim and such a good deal for $6 :) You can mix and match any flavours."}
{"text":"I LOVE their fish waffles with red bean!  5 pieces for $5 is a really good deal!  They have other snacks there I haven't tried yet.  I think this place also has a food cart near yonge and finch.  I will definitely be back in the warmer months to try their fish waffle ice cream!!  Looks amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place through BlogTO and my friends and I knew we had to drop by! It was a rainy weekday and it wasn't busy at all, the store is pretty small though with a few chairs if you want to enjoy your food inside. We got the ~ $5 taiyaki cone with a scoop of green tea and red bean ice cream. It is exactly how it sounds, super delicious! My top green tea icecream fell though. The red bean was delicious still. It came with a cookie on top and a chocolate pocky.  Note: if you were to get the taiyaki (not the cone), it does not contain egg - the taiyaki cone however does contain egg so be careful if you're allergic  I would totally return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The red bean waffles are great. This place is a little small but the waffles taste great in my opinion. Not too sweet and so fresh. Taste even more delicious in cold winter days!  I wanna try their pancakes next time. Looks so yummy!"}
{"text":"Same owner as the korean snack street stall in front of shoppers at yonge and finch, this place delivers the same taste and quality as the other location.   The red bean fish dessert and ho-deuk soo good! They are the two best sellers.  They also have red bean fish dessert with ice cream that looks interesting. Only because the fish shaped bread has its mouth open and that's where the ice cream is placed.  The only down side is that they dont offer as much item as the street stall. Which is weird because this is an actual restaurant. I hope they will change this soon.  Overall I do like coming here more than the street stall because the lines are shorter and you can park for free."}
{"text":"The store is small and does not have a lot of seats. BUT the fish pancake with ice cream was really good! They made fresh fish pancake and you can see how they make it by standing in front of the counter while you are waiting for the orders. They also give a lot of ice cream for you. I barely can finish it. It's good for two people share one fish pancake with ice cream."}
{"text":"Grabbed a few snacks cuz I was in the area. One off the bookmarks list! Huzzah!  Had the pan fried rice cake skewers ($5/4) - Definitely had crisp edges. I had half of mine spicy and half of mine sweet. The sweet ones still have a slight spice kick to them. Be careful. These can get messy. For $5, it's not cheap, but it isn't ridiculously expensive either.  Also got the red bean fish cakes ($5/5) - These weren't made to order, but they were still warm when I ate them. I prefer Galleria's. These ones are smaller and there's a creaminess that I find in Galleria's red bean paste that I don't find in these ones. These ones are still good though.  Hotteok ($5/3). These were magical. I've never had fresh hotteok before. Think of this as a dough ball filled with cinnamon sugar and then pressed flat while being cooked on a flat top so that they're pancake shaped. These were made to order. I watched as the lady grabbed dough out of a container, then put sugar in them. There's something lovely about watching someone make food properly. I had one within 3 minutes of her putting them into a box (she separated each one using parchment paper so they wouldn't stick). The sugar on the inside was all melted and gooey and delicious and the outside was crispy. It was also scalding hot.   It was cold and raining when we came yesterday, so I opted out of the ice cream fishes, but next time, I'm thinking of getting that, or their shaved ices/patbingsoo ($7.99), or going back to the hotteok, cuz those were amazing."}
{"text":"Who knew that delicious fish-shaped waffles and ice cream could be obtained from a tiny little takeout shop in Vaughan?  This takeout restaurant serves Korean rice cakes and a couple of other savoury items but the real draw is their waffles shaped like little fish. You can order ones filled with mung beans, custard, and red bean. Special open-mouthed, red bean filled, fish shaped waffle cones can be ordered with one scoop ($4.44) or two scoops ($5.55) of pretty decent ice cream. Choices include black sesame, ginger, green tea, coconut, red bean, mango, vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. They ran out of the red bean waffle cones by the time hubby was going to order, so they gave him his order of ginger and black sesame ice creams in a cup and didn't charge him additional for my custard waffle. The ginger ice cream was particularly noteworthy as it had chunks of candied ginger in it.   I quite enjoyed my custard waffle as the flavour and texture and the sweet smell of the waffles whisked me away to recall having similar fresh made waffles in one of the flea markets in Kyoto. The price you pay for ice cream and red bean waffle cone is well worth it as it's very filling! I definitely recommend especially if you're a fan of red bean or custard waffles."}
{"text":"What a nice small dessert place. It was a good experience overall but not as amazing but I will try again for sure. Solid 3.5 stars!  Food: 3/5, I got the black bean ice cream with fish shaped cone. I just wished the cone was made with the exact fish shaped (boong-uh-bbang) instead it was just the shape cone.  Service: 3/5, nice guy and older lady. They were smiling and we had a good time overall.  Ambience: 3/5, not much as just one table and TV. But it's good if you have a small number of people.  Price: 4/5, about $5 per person for a gourmet ice cream decorated uniquely."}
{"text":"Delicious! Wonderful! I want more now!  Came to this plaza to go to the TD, but noticed that THIS is where the red bean waffle house is. Ever since I saw Jennifer K's delicious photos, I wanted to print them off and eat them. But I decided to wait and go for myself.  The place is quite small, but service was fast and the guy working there was courteous. My boyfriend pointed out the fact that this place was opened by the same people that run the pojangmacha food carte at yonge and finch. No wonder.. all the food seems so similar. I didn't try the other stuff but I had the giant red bean waffle stuffed with ice cream and it was delicious! SOOO much ice cream though, but biting into the ice cream and the waffle is definitely a treat. The waffle is crisped to perfection and it's crunchy and chewy all at the same time. Perfect. I also liked the fact that the red bean taste was not overpowering.  Just thinking and writing about the amazing waffle I had today is mouth watering and I am just baffled by how good it was. I am definitely coming back.. like, now."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this popular and trendy dessert place so I decided to try it out. They have their signature Ice Cream Fish Waffle dessert here. For $5, you get two scoops of ice cream (red bean, green tea, vanilla, mango or sesame (for extra) in a fish waffle. I thought it's a great price for such a dessert. The fish waffle was nicely designed and it was good when it's hot. It does get messy though if you don't eat it right away as the hot waffle starts melting the ice cream. It's a nice little mom and pop shop. It's quite small with very little seating. Overall, it's a great dessert place and I'm bias because I love ice cream waffle. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"The ice cream red bean waffle is wonderful yet simple concept that works extremely well. It exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  While I wouldn't say the waffle was fresh, it was still somewhat lukewarm. The waffle was still mildy crisp on the outside and yet still somewhat nice and chewy on the inside. It's an excellent red bean waffle, unfortunately just lacking a bit of actual red bean (although it is in the batter?), otherwise everything was perfect.   The ice cream is standard here but it's not like you were expecting in-house made ice cream. It's more than adequate and it's still a treat. Taking a bite out of both the ice cream and waffle was extremely satisfying, something I enjoyed more than a normal cone! And at $5 it isn't something too expensive."}
{"text":"Very good quality ice cream! I particularly enjoyed the ginger ice cream as it has chunks of candied ginger in it! I was also pleasantly surprised to discover red bean in the fin of the waffle cone. Prices were on the pricy side ($4-$5ish) but the cones were worth it! Will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Bungeoppang waffles are all made to order. The fish design is very cute and something you would only find in asian countries. Up until now, I was only familiar with the regular waffle with filling. Now that they have a store, they introduced the waffle cone! This store is amazing because you cannot find these products anywhere else in Toronto. The ice cream waffle cone had a nice presentation. The ice cream was generic stuff you can get at the supermarket.  The waffle cone was water proof and sturdy. The tail part had additional red bean filling.  The store was pretty small and the seating area... while it had quite a few seats seemed crowded with 2 tables."}
{"text":"I'm not a big ice cream fan but their brown sugar pancakes gave me that kick which I needed. Mind you it's a tiny little shop with limited space for the patrons but quite worth the visit for the sugar rush. A word of advice, parking is just horrendous in the plaza which this place is situated within. Try the back if you fail to find a spot within the central region. The plaza is directly located across from Centerpoint Mall on the north side of Steeles Avenue."}
{"text":"The ice-cream fish waffle was mediocre. The \"cone\" was somewhat tough from sitting on the counter, and the ice-creams (green tea & sesame) were generic. The red bean paste (near the end of its tail) was nothing special either. If I do go back, it would be for their Bungeoppang, which tastes the same as the ones in Korea."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place I was warmly greeted by the guy working there. The store itself was a bit disappointing. I was expecting a bigger store with a better seating area. However, I really liked the menu on the wall. The menu had images of all the food items and clearly showed the prices.    I ended up getting a red bean waffle ice cream with mango ice cream for $5 (after taxes). The price increases to $6 if you were to get ginger, black sesame, or coconut flavored ice cream.  I liked the presentation of waffle ice cream and thought the ice cream tasted good but the waffle could be improved. I found the outer parts of the waffle to be hard and this is probably because the waffles appear to just sit out on the counter all day until somebody orders it. I understand how making waffles ahead of time makes it easier to serve customers but I think a fresh waffle would greatly improve the whole waffle ice cream experience and would be well worth the wait.   I would probably come back here next time if I were in the area to try the other ice cream flavors and maybe the other menu items."}
{"text":"I love red bean waffles, so I was excited when I saw that they serve red bean waffles with icecream here! I ordered the black sesame icecream with red bean waffle. Unfortunately the red bean waffle I was given was cold and hard, it felt like my tooth was going to chip off from biting into the waffle. So disappointed - why would you even serve a cold waffle to a customer! I don't know anyone who eats cold waffles. The icecream itself was of average quality.  My verdict? Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Red Bean Waffle House is a humble Korean snack shop known for their fun fish shaped waffle cakes (aka. Bungeoppang), filled with red bean paste (6 for $5) or even Nutella (4 for $5). It is run by the same folks behind the amazing Korean food cart by the Shoppers Drug Mart at Yonge and Finch (the only successful and remaining active food cart from the failed and forgotten 'Toronto a la Cart' street food program). They don't hide that fact at all, with pictures of that cart posted above your head as you wait for your goodies while a Jays game blares from the TV.  The Kims do serve some of their food cart yummies like squid balls here as well. But what is attracting people to the fringes of North Koreatown (to the point you're technically in the 905), are the ice cream stuffed in those fish shaped waffles. For $5, the variety of flavours to choose from is small (vanilla, mango, green tea, black sesame, chocolate), but well presented: the fish literally screams ice cream! The crispy fried waffles certainly makes for a better cone than your average traditional ice cream cone. Concept is fun enough just to try!  It is located in a nondescript plaza in 100 Steeles West, right across from the Centrepoint Mall's Canadian Tire, literally the first traffic lights west of Yonge Street. The parking lot is laid out in a stupidly frustrating way. Luckily for TTC riders the 60 bus stops right at this intersection. The shop itself has only a table, and nobody owning the commercial strip has won an award for not providing benches on the property."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with this dessert store as I saw this on blogto and made me want to come. The waffle was kind of on the stale side in my opinion and the ice cream was your basic green tea, Red Bean or mango from the tub.  I've eaten better red bean fish waffles I wouldn't order it alone in my opinion. Prices are decent if you wanted the basic flavors of ice cream but have to pay a bit more if you want the the ginger or black sesame flavors.  The store also sells other snack foods but I didn't get to try it so I'm basically reading my review on the red bean waffle ice cream that I ate presentation was very nice just like other photos but maybe that's just what it is a photo op."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday at 3pm. There was no line up at all which was BLESSED. My friend ordered the ice cream red bean fish and loved it. I ordered the sugar brown pancakes but it took 5-10 minutes to make and they warned me. TOTALLY WORTH IT it was fresh as hell. Also the workers were so nice it was this young gentlemen and this elder lady I wanna say it was a son and grandma or mother duo? Comes to think of it I wish i left them a tip in their little tip cup now. Awesome place guys check it !!!"}
{"text":"Love their Japanese-style red bean waffles ( in fish shape).  I would say they are the best so far.  The price is also ridiculously reasonable.  The owners are always friendly.  One time, they were so nice that they even reserved a half dozen of the red bean waffles for me to pick up just before closing time.  I'm so glad that I called first, it was because rest of the red bean waffles were all sold out the time when I arrived.  When you are craving for Japanese-style red bean waffles, you have to come here and you won't regret."}
{"text":"After dinner our party of 7 wanted to try out this red bean fish waffle ice cream place. According the yelp it was closing in 1/2 hr so we rushed on over. There was still quite a lineup for orders.   I glanced briefly through their menu And notice they had savoury snacks too. Maybe next time. The Red Bean Fish Waffle Ice Cream came with 2 scoops of IC flavours. I was sharing mine with my bestie. So she chose Black Sesame & I chose Green Tea. Oh my goodness the Black Sesame was sooooooooooo good! Banged with flavour, so fraquant and meld in your mouth yumminess! But i wished the waffle cone was bit more stiff and wished there was a bit more red bean paste. But boy was it fullfilling.   Also tried their brown sugar street food pancakes. Ohhhhh my gawd so good! You gotta eat it straight up when they hand it to you. All that brown sugar googiness just oozes out and the crispy pancake was to die for!  Would definitely come back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Went there at 8 pm on a Friday night and all fish ice cream cone are sold out already. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I tried black sesame and coconut icecream with the fish waffle, it taste delicious."}
{"text":"The ice cream stated melting way too fast. The red bean waffle were delicious."}
{"text":"The idea is amazing and the ice cream was good.  I loved the presentation with sprinkles, pocky and all!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for quite some time. However, they close super early (8pm) so every time we wanted to go they are closed. For some reason that day, we finished dinner super early. We were craving for some ice cream, so we decided to give this place a try!   We ordered the fish waffle with two scoops of ice cream (sesame and coconut). The coconut and the sesame ice cream were delicious! The coconut ice cream had chunks of coconut inside. The waffle was okay. I was expecting the waffle to be warm and freshly made on the spot. We got a waffle which was cold but at least it was soft. As we were observing the place, we can see a row of fish waffle made before hand and cooled on the rack before placing ice cream. It was a little disappointing! :(  The place is super small; it is more of a take-out place. They have a mini table and a few chairs. However, it wasn't busy that day so we managed to find a spot to sit.    Overall, if you are around the area and craving for some ice cream and waffle, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream treat :)  Red bean waffle house has some of the best ice cream, not because it's extremely unique or delicious, just because of the overall experience this little ice cream shop provides, just makes you feel all nice and happy inside. And when I say little ice cream shop, I mean little.  It was actually kinda hard to spot while looking for it in the plaza. When you find it and enter it, it's the tiniest shop you could imagine, which kinda sucks if you wanna sit there and eat (I opted to eat in the car). Back to the review, for what you get, the price is amazing. One portion of ice cream is really filling or a great treat to share. They have five flavors of ice cream which are all delicious.  Presentation of the ice cream is great (especially if you plan on instagramming it). As well, service is nice and friendly, quick as well.  I always come here is I'm looking for a sweet treat to sit and chat around. I love this place!   (There are other foods on the menu but I only ever come here for ice cream)"}
{"text":"Who eats patbingsu when its -23 outside? Me! Like after many dinners, I was in need of something sweet. I debated going to a dessert place along Yonge, but decided to check out places along Steele. This small shoppe is located in a fairly busy restaurant filled plaza. It has limited seating, as most of their business is takeout of those cute fish shaped goodies. I almost ordered one, until I saw patbingsu on the chalkboard menu! Had to order it! It's about $10 and worth the price. A mountain of shaved ice, topped with red bean, vanilla ice cream, condensed milk, and fresh fruit. The lady who owns/runs the place is really sweet too. She giggled when she saw my boyfriend and I destroying it. Now I know where to go when I miss Korea and want that deliciously refreshing dessert."}
{"text":"Not surprised, because I expected it to be pretty awesome.   The ice creams were delicious and the fish-shaped red bean waffle was really yummy. The shape of the waffle makes it fun to eat and the jokes that come with it (granted if you have the right company) makes the experience all the better!  Small shop, but there is a table that could seat 5. There are other savoury street foods on the menu and you can actually buy the red bean waffles separately if you want to snack on them later."}
{"text":"Came here to try the fish shaped egg waffles with ice cream. This is a small shop located at the plaza across from Centrepoint mall. I decided to try the waffle with green tea and red bean ice cream. I loved the presentation of it as the fish waffle is cute and they decorate it with sprinkles and a pocky stick. But in terms of taste I felt that it was just average.  The waffle is cute but I think it would have been better if the waffle was freshly made and hot as my waffle was somewhat hard and that made it hard to taste the egg flavour. Probably one somewhat unique thing about the waffle is that there is a small portion of red bean paste inside it nesr the tail end of the waffle.  In terms of the portions they give a generous serving of ice cream and the ice cream is not bad. You have to eat it quick though and maintain a good balance of the ice cream scoops so it does not fall off the waffle.  In terms of the service it was pretty quick. There is one table inside that can seat 4 people. Despite the waffle being somewhat hard I still think this is a nice place to come by to grab some ice cream on a hot humid summer day."}
{"text":"The concept was not bad, but I think it doesn't extend too far from just a concept. The waffle unfortunately was extremely cold so it became hard to eat (who eats cold waffles?) and the ice cream unfortunately was very  basic green tea ice cream, similar to the no name green tea ice cream at a supermarket.  The rice cakes were so spicy my mouth was on fire. I don't think many people can handle that kind of spice. Good effort though."}
{"text":"3.5  Came here after a disappointing dinner to cheer us up.  Red Bean Waffle House serves up some pretty good desserts, but you need to go early in the day.  Pros: Red bean waffles are delish, better than night markets  Cons: They run out of stuff quickly  Like I said, I came here after a disappointing dinner experience to cheer myself up.  Red bean waffles are one of my fav desserts and these type of places shape them like fish.  As soon as you walk in, the smell of them perks you right up.  It's a very inviting smell indeed.  The red bean waffles were very good.  They were crispy on the outside, warm on the inside.  We came at about 7pm and tasted very fresh.  Me and my GF both feel that they are better here than at night markets.    So we came at 7pm and it was sad to see that they were sold out of everything else.  All they had left was the waffles.  I can understand if it was closer to closing time, but when it;s two hours away I feel they should still have everything available.  The Nutella pancake looked so good and I wanted to try one so bad.  So I will be back to try the pancake one day to update the review.  Looking forward to it already."}
{"text":"Location/Service: I was craving for some ice cream one snowy winter weekday and decided to head over to this plaza to try the red bean fishy waffle. The place is inside a foodie plaza where it is right next to a Korean restaurant - Kobe BBQ. There are lots of parking here so no need to worry about that. As soon as I walked, I was greeted by a Korean lady, whom I am guessing is the lady owner. She was nice and immediately asked me what I wanted. There was also a young gentleman at the back too, who served me the waffle ice cream. I am guessing the older lady just does the hot snack foods. The place itself is REALLY small. There are 2 tables of 4 (very gross, filthy tables) and some side bar one-person stools. This is definitely a snack place, and not a place for people to have a full course meal. But, I can see it being busy on summer nights.    Food:   I ordered the red bean waffle with 2 scoops of ice cream - coconut and black sesame ($6.50 tax in). Both were very delicious! To be the honest, the ice cream is store bought but it would have been tastier (in my opinion) if it was soft served. The \"fishy\" waffle is opened for the ice cream to fill in, but the tail has the red bean paste like the traditional Korean snack. It had a good amount of red beans. The young guy topped the whole thing with a chocolate pocky stick, some sugar sprinkles and a small Korean snack cookie. It didn't take the guy long to make and I could tell he did put effort into making it because the ice cream scoops were pretty large and it looked great!   Overall, I would definitely come back to get this ice cream dessert in the future. What really intrigued me the most was the \"how you eat the red bean fishy waffle determines your personality\" poster on the side wall. It was really interesting and definitely a great read when you are enjoying the dessert! I'll be back in the summer to try their bingsu and their street snacks :)"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a confusing plaza, and might be hard to find if you are new to the area. I have been wanting to try this place for a while, but it is kind of out of the way from where I live, but I finally made it!   These ice cream fish waffle cones are so cute! but I feel that's as far as it goes. I had a scoop of green tea and red bean on the fish shaped egg waffle cone. It came with a chocolate bread stick and a chocolate drop wafer thingy of some sort on top. Costed about $5.  The ice cream did not taste fresh. It tasted like it was old ice cream. You know when you have 4 month+ old ice cream in your freezer and one day you decide to have some because you have an ice cream craving and have no chose but to eat that old ice cream because you are broke or too lazy to go to the store to get fresh ice cream? LOL. Well that's what the green tea and red bean from Red Bean Waffle House tasted like. The fish waffle was hard, crispy and cold. It would have been nice if it was freshly made. It tasted like a sweet dinner bread roll that was made the night before (hence the hard and crispy texture when I bit into it)  I'm giving this place a 3 because I did enjoy the gimmicky experience eating this fish ice cream waffle cone, but in terms of taste I'd probably never go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place ! I love their ice cream fishes $5 for two scoops or your choice. Their Nutella fishes are great ( off menu) 4 for $5 is a great alternative if you didn't like the taste of red bean like me."}
{"text":"So apparently these are the same people who make the bungeoppang right in front of the Shoppers Drug Market near Yonge and Finch. I've bought their bungeoppang at their little stand previously and have always loved their stuff.   This little shop is located across the Centrepoint Mall, in the plaza with the TD Bank. The parking lot can get quite busy at the front of the store. You can find more parking at the north side of the plaza where the receiving and shipping area is (at the stop sign where the country butcher shop is, turn in to find more parking).  So today I was pretty psyched to finally try some ice cream in a fish waffle cone; its about the cutest thing I've seen in dessert in a while. The cone itself is so cute yet sturdy. I would say it's not soft like their bungeoppang, which I really wish it was the same. It's actually more of a thicker denser waffle cone. And, at the tail end of the cone there is some red bean filling. It's a good sized dessert for 5$ and definitely shareable  if you don't have too much of a sweet tooth. Pro tip: pay in cash for no tax. They do accept credit and debit too though, just you got to pay tax.  What's also really cool is their nutella-filled bungeoppang (4 pc. for 5$). So delicious! Especially if you love Nutella. I kind of wish there was more seating available. It's hard to enjoy ice cream in a waffle cone on a cold day in April in Canada. There were only 2 small tables and 4-6 chairs available and the place can get quite crowded. I'm sure this place will be busy during the warmer seasons."}
{"text":"Loved the creaminess of the ice cream and the warm waffle cone that it is served in! Bonus points because it looks like a fish which is super cute!!  Only thing I didn't appreciate was that the cone had dry dust particles which probably resulted from not cleaning the waffle maker properly- had to keep picking these out which was kind of a dealbreaker!"}
{"text":"Once you eat one waffle. you got to need another! The waffle ice cream here is delicious and mouth watering! I expected it to be very sweet but as it turns out, it wasn't too sweet and was just right. The red bean was very good, as well as the waddle itself. Not to mention the ice cream was a great combination with the waffle, and the red bean.   The place is very small as there are only about 3 chairs. There is no area to sit down and chill with friends, as it is more of a take out creamery/bakery.   I would recommend this place! I would definitely revisit and try all the other flavors of ice cream! The price is affordable and very reasonable for the quality of the dessert."}
{"text":"It's a small shop with just one table and 6 chairs. This is also the store location for the street food stand at Finch & Yonge!! I absolutely adore that street vendor so I was stoked :)  We got the Red Bean Waffle Ice Cream and tteokbokki!! The waffle ice cream was $5 each and the tteokbokki was $5 for 4 skewers (you can't just buy 1 skewer like at the street stand). Originally I thought the waffle would be hot and the ice cream would be cold - turns out I was wrong!! The waffle was not hot. My friends loved it.  The tteokbokki was amazing as always!! You can choose between spicy or teriyaki sauce. If you don't specify which you want (like me), you'll end up getting the spicy. AND IT'S HOT I TELL YA HOOOOT.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and is the only place I know of that serves taiyaki with ice cream inside.   The waffle was nice and crispy, with red bean at the bottom to prevent the ice cream from dripping. I hope they add soft serve to the ice cream as an option.   The place is extremely small, so you can't really sit inside, but it's a great spot for a snack!"}
{"text":"Stopped by earlier than we wanted to yesterday since I read from reviews that they tend to run out of the ice cream cones. There was a 30 minute wait for the cones when we got there since they ran out and had some technical difficulties prior to my arrival. This was not a problem at all since we were trying to kill time and they let us know in advance which was much appreciated!  This is really worth the price - for two orders it came up to a flat $10 ($5 on the dot each after tax).  Each order comes with one waffle cone, two scoops of ice cream, pocky stick and a small biscuit on top! Looking over their menu, I noticed that the quantity is worth the prices! They had 8 dumplings for $5, 4 rice cake skewers for $5, etc. Next time I will try their actual food items instead of dessert cos it looked really delicious in the pictures...   I can see why some people will find it messy, because the ice cream melts really fast due to the warm cone. However the trick is to use the spoon to scoop the ice cream then bite the cone!! My boyfriend tried to bite into the ice cream and cone - it was so messy there was ice cream spilling everywhere when he ate it... meanwhile I had no mess. I ate after him because I spent a good 5 minutes taking pictures and I didn't even spill as much!   This is a really good combination and I feel the ice cream really compliments the waffle (ice cream and waffle goes together so well anyway :P)! I just wish there was more red bean filling in the waffle. There was only a small amount at the tail of the fish :(   Service was also good. Nothing negative to say, the workers were very polite, informative and quick!   It's a really small place, only one small table of 4 and a couple bar chairs so this is definitely a take out setting!   I definitely recommend this place if you love red bean Waffle and want to try something different. If you're a sweet tooth then you must definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The ice cream fish waffles here are so crunchy and thick that I devoured it faster than I expected. We stood and ate outside because the shop smelled greasy due to poor ventilation and small space so don't expect comfy seating. I guess the treat is geared to children because I did not really care for the cookies on top, but I would eat it again :D  Love how some Korean folks walked pass us as we ate and they literally slowed to stop and stare at the dessert with their gaping mouths. Must be something they all know and enjoyed but haven't had for a loooong time."}
{"text":"The fish-shaped waffle with 2 scoops of ice cream is worth the $5 dollars. However, in general, I might have put high expectation on it prior my arrival as I think the taste was very decent. The ice cream is generic as it is the same kind you get from those AYCE sushi place, not like homemade ice cream. The fish waffle was not hot and crispy as it was pre-made and left on the stone. It would be different and gets more stars if they were freshly made and hot. The red bean filling is placed at the tail part of the fish waffle and it was just a small portion of red bean.  I also ordered the spicy pan-fried rice cake and I think it was decent. The spicy sauce is made of gochujang paste that you could easily make it home.   Overall, it is a great place for Korean streetfood. I do recommend if you wanna try out their Taiyaki ice cream. I think I will come back, but not as a regular customer."}
{"text":"Kim's a la carte's fish waffles... with ice cream?!?! Who wouldn't want to try that?!   For the fish waffle cones, you get two scoops of ice cream and yes, you are allowed to mix and match. We ordered one with black sesame and green tea ice cream and another with chocolate and strawberry ice cream. On top of all this, we also got the nutella and brown sugar pancakes.   The pictures of these fish waffle cones are pretty enticing but, I was quite disappointed when I took a bite out of it. The only satisfying thing about it was the black sesame and strawberry ice cream. Not the best black sesame ice cream I've had but, it was the most enjoyable thing out of this dessert. On the other hand, loved the strawberry ice cream because it had actual strawberry pieces in it! (You prob know my love my strawberries from reading my other dessert reviews...) I was quite confused whether the fish waffles had red bean in it or not. I didn't see or taste any red bean in the waffle until I got down to the fish tail. There it was... a clump of red bean on one side of the tail...   The fish waffles here compared to the ones they have at their a la carte is lacking in flavour (and I'm only commenting for the fish waffle cone). This is probably because the ones here have been sitting out in the cold for a while (which makes sense.. since a hot steamy fish waffle cone won't be a stable platform for two giant scoops of ice cream...) The fish waffles definitely tastes A LOT better when served hot (just saying!).   Aside from the waffles, the pancakes were good however, it gets wayyy too sweet after a few bites. The nutella was tolerable. As for the brown sugar... couldn't finish it. Love the hint of cinnamon in it though! Love the batter as well, tender and crisp (it'd be really tasty with green onions in it...)  Overall, love the concept of the fish waffle cone however not impressed. I will just stick with Kim's a la carte."}
{"text":"Red bean filled waffle cake in the shape of a fish?  Bungeoppang   I saw that in Korean grocery stores and oh they tastes so good especially when they are freshly made. And you probably saw it at Toronto a la cart at Yonge and Finch. http://m.yelp.ca/biz/kims-%C3%A0-la-cart-north-york  Red Bean Waffle House, a newly opened Korean pastry and snack place is run by the same people of the only successful food cart program by City of Toronto.  Open 6 days of week and they really prefected this snack. The outlayer always crispy, inside stuffed with red bean and just the ultimate comfort food.  6 for $5 I almost started eating them before I got home... and trust me, I could have eaten all of them myself!   There are also Korean snacks like rice cake, squid, pancakes, dumplings available. You have a choice of eating in at a small bar area or to go."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with this idea is a genius! I mean, ice cream is always delicious, but for some reason eating it out of a fish-shaped pastry is infinitely better. The selection of ice cream flavours at this shop is not super extensive - mostly basic flavours like vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, red bean, green tea, mango, etc. but they do try to get a little bit exotic by offering ginger, black sesame, and coconut. You get two scoops of ice cream to put in your fish waffle, and you can pick two different flavours. I got coconut and ginger and both flavours were so so good and also blended surprisingly well! The coconut had actual chunks of coconut in it, which was a pleasant surprise. The flavour was light and tropical and super refreshing. I was also pleasantly surprised by the ginger, because it was a lot less sharp than I had expected. But it worked for me because it also had a slight sweetness to it which I really enjoyed. The fish waffle in this case is basically like an ice cream cone - it has a nice crispiness to it and there is a little bit of red bean paste in the tail. If anything I'd say I wish the waffle was a little bit warmer and softer, but I see how that could create a problem with the ice cream. The whole thing is decently large, and considering you pay either $4.44 + tax or $5.55 + tax (depending on which flavours you get), is an extremely good deal - definitely one of the cheaper dessert items I've had like, anywhere, and even cheaper than most basic ice cream places. I am thoroughly impressed and honestly just can't get over how cheap it is for what you are getting. Wish I lived closer so I could come here more often to get my ice cream fix! They also have just the fish waffles (without ice cream) in red bean or nutella flavour and Korean pancakes."}
{"text":"Red Bean Waffle House is a tiny restaurant with 2-3 tables that specializes in ice cream and waffles. I came here after seeing some awesome photos of fish-shaped waffles with a mouthful of ice cream. I came here on a warm weekend afternoon to indulge myself. I ordered a waffle with red bean and mango. The waffle was hot off the grill, so the ice cream melted fairly quickly. It's definitely not a place to look elegant while eating. I wish these came in bowls to catch the melted ice cream that oozes out. I wish there was a washroom so that I can wash my hands afterwards. The ice cream was very tasty as was the waffle. However, the hot mess makes it less than appealing after the first experience."}
{"text":"Some very good ice cream served in a very unique way. The fish shaped cone was very delicious and was absolutely worth the trip. Mom and Pop sort of shop with a reasonable variety of flavours for an Asian ice cream store. Will definately go back. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"Walked by after having dinner at a near by Korean BBQ restaurant. My kids want to have dessert so, we decided to give the red bean waffle ice cream a try.  the idea of using red bean fish waffle in place of cone; it's unique. It comes with 2 scoops of ice cream ( you can ask for mixed scoop). We had chocolate & red bean. The ice cream is yummy and the waffle is warm and crunchy when you first get it. However, if you don't eat your fast, your waffle will get kinda chewy after it turn cold."}
{"text":"I had a red bean waffle and a red bean waffle ice cream. The waffle was perfect - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The red bean paste was also not too sweet. The ice cream was of good quality (I got strawberry and green tea) but it does overpower the cone. I loved having the fish tail stuffed with red bean though :) very small place with only 4 seats so not ideal for big groups"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there just for the fish like waffle. Definitely not fresh. Most likely pre made. I guess I was expecting batter tasting like the Chinese ones like whoofles. Big mistake. And ice cream is nothing but regular store bought frozen hard ice cream.  First and last time."}
{"text":"I took my little cousin here the other week and it was delicious! Service was fast and friendly and the fishy cones are adorable. There's very little seating inside but it's all good there's benches outside :) prices are what you'd expect. I'd return!"}
