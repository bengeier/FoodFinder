{"text":"First time customer. Won't be a repeat that's for sure. Way too much to write, but I will say terrible service and incredibly overpriced. Payed $37 for 3 sandwiches. What the heck?! Easy on the mayo, guys. Sheesh."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when it comes to hot and cold sandwhiches. Chips, a toasted sandwhich, and your set to run out the door. If you're ever downtown, check this out. Only m-f though."}
{"text":"I placed a huge order at 915am or so today for delivery at 10:45am today and they not only delivered it but everything was great.  If you have to call for a corporate order ask for Amber.  As this is located in the midst of downtown Phoenix AZ--a lot of orders are corporate orders.   They rock!

She's amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a vegetarian sandwich and it was fantastic. Great service and prices. Plenty of seating with clean environment. Hot pepper mix-on subs is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich shop. Service is speedy and efficient. A bit more expensive than Subway, but much tastier."}
{"text":"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because I'm a lapsed vegetarian and I'm always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because I'm a malt freak and found out they have malteds there.

I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill.

Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier.

The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type.

I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though.

The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips I've ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches and a nice patio except for all the smokers. It is not uncommon to see non customers pull up a chair and pollute the patio with smoke. Management is aware but does nothing."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches! Avoid the chain restaurants!!
  I little pricy (not ridiculous) but kind of expected for downtown Phx.
Call ahead if you are in a hurry, lines can be long."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for SEVEN YEARS people.  The absolute best place to grab a sandwich downtown without a doubt.  I go with a Turkey/Provolone with \"Everything\".  OMG.  They have never failed me once.  It is always excellent and the bread... I could sit in a corner and eat that damn french bread all day.  It's like when you go to a great restaurant and the bread that is served before the meal... all warm, chewy... you just want to slather a ton of butter on it and unbutton that top button, ya know?  It is awesome.  Always clean.  There are a ton of people there that are lifers, family place.  Just don't hold up the line!  Go around to the right hand side and figure out what you want and get out of my way so I can get my sammich!!!  Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Sticklers is a great spot to grab a good sandwich! The Traffic Jam is my favorite. Get everything on it!!!"}
{"text":"Place has amazing sandwiches milkshakes and soup also their baked goods are phenomenal always just smiley faces and feels right at home fantastic pricing and excellent salads!"}
{"text":"Nice location on 3rd Ave with Washington with large inside space and generous and cool patio. The service is fast and the food was good: I had the chilli soup and meatball sandwich and they were very good.
I personally dislike that my food was delivered \"to go\" style no plates. I would like to have dine in option.
Good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Great location! Very filling!

Went here to grab a sammie before a meeting at City Hall. I got the Italian with provolone on wheat bread. Well, I ordered it on wheat but got French bread. BUT they gave me a cookie to say sorry for the mix-up... HOW NICE IS THAT!? I didn't care what bread I got, my waistline may care but who listens to their waistline these days, I just wanted to sandwich. And it was great!

A tad spicey for me but I also choose the Italian seasoning too so I was asking for it. The cookies were so moist and soft, fell apart in my hand like delicious sand-heaven. The interior of this joint is so city-scape and metro. Super high ceiling, old bar like ordering station, booths that face out onto the street... everything was great!

Had a bit of trouble understanding the guy making my lunch but if he was kind enough to give me a cookie for messing up my bread, he can talk as fast as he wants because I'll be back for sure. I went around 1:30pm and it was bumping so I'm assuming it's packed at peak lunch hour time, well worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I am, once again, reminded how much I love Stickers.  You order your sandwich, it's toasted, and then you order your toppings.  You MUST, however, order your shake at the very beginning or you will be shamed.  The sandwiches and shakes are divine.  The line moves quickly.  And at lunchtime there is always a juror in the line who hasn't been downtown in 5 years and wants to talk about how pleasantly surprised he/she is at the changes.  You can feel like a tour guide in your own city."}
{"text":"This place is good for lunch.  They are pretty efficient and you can get in and out quickly.  You can either get a toasted sandwich or a salad.  The salad line is really quick and you basically get to cut in front of the sandwich people.  If you work downtown or if you are on jury duty, Stickler's is a quick option for lunch."}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot in downtown Phoenix!

They make good sandwiches hot or cold and salads; along with milk shakes and ice cream. The crowd is heavy during lunch time with all the state and federal employees along with the court house next door (yeah stickers is a good deal after you have dolled out cash for tickets!) 

Parking is a hassle, the customer service is decent. Give them a try and let me know what your experience is like."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich place in downtown Phoenix. Nothing too special, just sandwiches that you could probably make at home. Interior set up for ordering is a tad odd, just a heads up. 3 stars sums up this place accurately since it's literally average."}
{"text":"Very good Italian sandwich in the New Jersey/East Coast fashion. Italian meats, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato and that awesome Italian blend dressing (oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, dried herbs, etc) The dressing was perfect and classic combination of tart, sweet and salty. Oh and Provolone cheese. Again. Very traditional. 

 Let the dressing meld into the sandwich a bit before eating. Very good, very crusty bread that won't get soggy with the dressing. 

The line was crazy long when we got there. But it moves real fast. People literally eat and run so seating is available. Lots of cops and lawyers."}
{"text":"It's amazing that they're using Styrofoam cups to cook their eggs in the microwave?!??! I am certain there's some very legitimate health reasons for not using Styrofoam in the microwave like plastic chemicals leeching into your food."}
{"text":"I recently lucked out just looking for place to kill some nearly-free meter time (it was a slow week!) and stumbled into this place.  I'd seen it before, sometime when it was not open.  Frankly, with the kind of incredibly defined and specialized niche that this place appeals to, i'm surprised they don't close up between breakfast and lunch!  

Anyway I strolled in the door just before 10:30 when they stop serving breakfast items, according the the signs, and ordered a parfait.  Just a snack.  There were just a few people there, and I still had a significant, if not particularly long, wait to order my pre-made parfait and pay for it and a bottle of cranberry juice.  Anyway everything looked pretty decent and clean and the people were nice enough, so I'd come back, even though I dislike waiting in lines.  I'm looking forward to trying out the Happy Valley location, though - it's a short distance from where I work."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the food quality. I order a chicken salad sandwich which was amazing. Go check it out it is worth the visit"}
{"text":"If Sandwiches were a religion? Sticklers is the Cathedral!!! \"Traffic Jam\" GET IN MY FACE!!! Sooooooooooooooooo GOOD!! I'm a big SAMMICH FAN!! If you don't eat here, it's mostly because of how you are failing at life. GO THERE NOW. Be winner like the rest of us!"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you need a quick bite downtown.  Fast service as well.  I recommend the Traffic Jam or Italian sandwiches."}
{"text":"Another one of my lunch time favorites.  I usually go here for the large salad bar when I want a quick, inexpensive, healthy lunch.  At just under $7 for unlimited toppings, it's a great deal!  The ingredients are always fresh and the staff is friendly.  The best part about getting a salad is skipping the line of people waiting for their sandwich and going directly to the register!

Sometimes I go to Sticklers, fully intending to get a salad, but as soon as I walk in the door, the smell of the fresh bread gets me and instantly I have changed my mind.  Many of my coworkers love the Traffic Jam, however I am partial to the Tuna sandwich.  I am not usually a fan of tuna in other restaurants, I really don't like when my lunch protein is served with a scooper and makes a \"plop\" sound when it lands on the bread.  Let me clarify, Sticklers does not have a Tuna Salad Sandwich, this is a Tuna Sandwich.  The tuna is just tuna, and you can add whatever mayo/mustard you want after the sandwich is toasted.

When my sandwich comes out of the toaster and I get to pick my toppings, I like everything (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mustard, etc) except the mayo and the oil.  If you like spicy, you have to get the hot peppers!!  In addition to the delicious french bread (they have wheat too) the hot peppers make the sandwich!!  I have even started asking for a side or two of hot peppers for my salad; I love them!!

Every once in a while, I'll go here for an afternoon sweet treat.  The malts and shakes are amazing!  They have breakfast too, however, I have yet to make it there in the AM.

Either way, Sticklers is one of my favorites for the downtown lunch scene, and where I take all of my friends that are visiting for jury duty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service, I was immediately helped even though it was lunch time and busy. I ordered an Oreo milkshake and a \"Jumbo Hot Pretzel\" with cheese.

The Oreo milkshake was perfect, very thick with a lot of Oreos, some places are cheap and add more milk which thins it out - but not here, it's definitely a lot of ice cream and a lot of Oreos! The prezel on the other hand was not hot and was thin, I was looking forward to a very warm, soft, and thick pretzel like their title says \"Jumbo Hot Pretzel.\" But neither was it jumbo or hot. The cheese was not bad, they gave a fair portion and it had some spice to it, like jalapeno cheddar.

Prices are also a bit high, a milkshake and pretzel with cheese will run you around $9."}
{"text":"Good food and customer service. Love the sandwiches and coffee. The owners are usually around and take good care of the place. The lines can be long at lunch time so if you are in a hurry then call ahead with your order."}
{"text":"My first time here was because of the chicken noodle soup, I heard it was a good slurp, and it's true, of all the places I've been downtown for chicken noodle soup, sticklers is hands down the best followed by the hearty chicken noodle soup of downtown deli. Anywho, I was here recently and saw their soup of the day was Cream of Mushroom, and when it comes to that kind of soup I'm a stickler (pun intended) of it because it's my favorite. Caught my reference, eh?! Well, ordered their Cream of Mushroom, and I don't know my mind was thinking of the goodness and creaminess of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom, so, perhaps I was putting it to a high standard before tasting it, I should have had sample before I committed to it too. Along with my soup I got myself a Vegetarian Sandwich on wheat. 

Service was quick and prompt, not sure when the lunch rush is but I usually lunch after 1, so, I guess the time I go is when the lunch crowd becomes sparse. Back to the soup. It was steaming, and I dipped my spoon, spooned out some mushroom goodness and was taken aback that it wasn't creamy but quite watery, hmmm, I believe in taking chances, and had a taste. Yea all my high expectations came crashing down, and disappointment creeped up. I'm gonna be honest I got the Vegetarian Sandwich as an afterthought to the soup, you know, a filler. The soup was just wrong, it was watery, it lacked flavor, and i started to miss and yearn for Campbell's cream of mushroom. My sandwich was on point and Sticklers hasn't failed me with their sandwiches, and I started wishing I had the chicken noodle but I didn't want to waste the mushroom, so, I ate the mushrooms in the soup, and threw the rest away. A waste. Overall, I know never to get their mushroom soup, and to stick to the tried and tasty chicken noodle soup. I still need to try their other sandwich concoctions but I'm still a fan nonetheless."}
{"text":"What a sandwich! Not a lot of frills, and the sides are underwhelming, but if you just want a really good toasted sandwich for lunch...Sticklers will hit the spot. 

And it's downright cheap!

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars, is because the service was a little course, and the place was REALLY busy without a lot of seating space. Plus, it's only open 'till 4 PM! And not at all on weekends! DOWNTOWN RESTARANTS THAT ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH ON WEEKDAYS DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!!!!!!

Come to think of it, the fact that I was willing to give it 4 stars despite all that is a testament to how awesome their sandwiches are., because there aren't many other good things to say about it."}
{"text":"Quick service, good sandwiches, and best salad bar.  The salad bar is behind the counter and the staff are great. The owner is a bit annoying hitting on all the girls like he thinks he's cool, but he's okay."}
{"text":"Honestly my first impression of Sticklers a decade ago wasn't that great. I just remember working as a contractor in Downtown, and having to pay $7~$8 dollar for a sandwich back then was a bit too much for me.  However, I ended up giving them another try recently by ordering ahead via phone. I must say, being able to just walk up to the pick-up counter, pay, and grab my lunch in less then a few minutes has earned Sticklers back on my regular lunch spot list."}
{"text":"Sticklers is a great breakfast and lunch spot in downtown Phoenix. My favorite sandwich is the \"traffic jam\" which is roast beef, hap, turkey and salami with Swiss on your choice of French or Wheat bread. 

Last time I was in Angelita was super nice and friendly. Great service"}
{"text":"Worst latte that I have ever had. No foam, all milk. Gross."}
{"text":"I saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cents. This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown. 

It's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too. 

Very typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the \"Traffic Jam\" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something \"fancy\" like black olives on it.

I would also challenge the \"clean\" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.

I give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here."}
{"text":"Trapped for jury duty on a heat advisory day. It's alright. Sticklers is here to save the day. The chicken salad sub was great! I did not feel like a Traffic Jam sub even though everyone was bragging about it in other reviews. Chocolate chip cookie was delicious, but ingredient is margarine not butter and there IS a difference. It's alright. Fresh fruit cup was $4.50 for breakfast. I'll try it again. I loved the interior, a re-purposed historical building in Phoenix. Well played."}
{"text":"Stickler's is a great place to grab a quick lunch.   The prices are good, and the quality is solid.  They have a good selection of sandwiches, toppings, and an excellent build your own salad option.  It is definately a cut a cut above it's competition.  I haven't tried the ice cream and shakes, but I hope to soon.  My only major complaint is that the hours are fairly limited.  Sticklers closes early during the weak and is closed on weekends, which is pretty normal for downtown restaurants.  You should definitely stop in if you want a fast and quality lunch in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sticklers - I've been searching for you...and I'm so happy I found you! Since starting a job downtown nearly a year ago I've been looking high and low for a place where I can make my own salad and not get charged an arm and a leg for liking lots of veggies.  And, now, here you are!  I see a long and beautiful lunchtime life together.  With over 30 fresh toppings and mix-ins UNLIMITED for $6.50 you are definitely the healthiest and best value in (down)town.  I may not go right at 12:30 when the crowds take up all of your indoor seating, but I have no doubt that I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of vegetarian sandwiches not made by me, and Sticklers has one of my favorites. It has 3 kinds of cheese all melted onto the usual toppings they put on there (watch out, the peppers are hot! I forgo them but get everything else), plus green bell peppers & mushrooms, on great toasty bread. Probably the most delicious 'grilled cheese' sandwich I've ever had!

If you need meat, I dig the Traffic Jam (like everyone else has said, a whole bunch 'o' meats all piled on w/the usual toppings), but if you don't want as much insanity, they have a Half & Half sammich where you can just choose 2 meats you want instead.

& all the sandwiches are the same price - cheap! They're all around $5, last I can remember.

Open up on weekends, Sticklers! I would make it worth your while!"}
{"text":"Great service! Quick and fast. I had jury duty and I ran out to grab lunch. Smart location! Great, healthy options."}
{"text":"So the parking options aren't great--mostly meters on the street. And it's mostly sandwiches. The cookies are mediocre. The line to order is confusing for first-timers. That bread, tho. It will suck you in and make you a believer. Also, the people are nice, and I like the high ceiling. And that bread."}
{"text":"I had Jury duty on Friday.....and I was in search of some coffee and a snack. This establishment is right next to the Municipal Court building downtown. While I didn't end up getting anything....the place is very nice with plenty of outdoor seating in the shade. I left court at about noon time and it was packed.....so I assumed the food was great and the service is definitely fast. Midwesterners might compare this place to \"Potbelly's\" which is a popular sandwich...soup...and dessert spot. So if your ever downtown near the municipal court house and you need a quick meal....this looks like a good choice. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friend!!!!"}
{"text":"1. \"Traffic Jam\" is best sandwich I've ever had (And i hate sandwiches).
2. Great bread to meat to vegi ratio.
3. Decent price"}
{"text":"I was performing my civic duty next door and didn't felt like walking too far so Sticklers it was for lunch. I wasn't too enthusiastic because I was expecting Sacks-like sandwiches. I ordered a BLT, chips and soda. When I took my first bite I was like whoa! This is not Sacks! The bread was wonderful! Crispy outside, chewy and warm inside. The filling was plenty and very tasty. I'll definitely return to Sticklers when I'm downtown and need a quick bite."}
{"text":"I seriously love this sandwich shop. The pretzels are great too. Speedy service and a  great menu. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Doing my civic duty with jury duty and hanging out in downtown Phoenix , so where to go? Being that it was a cold day having some soup  sounded about right . Just a block away from the federal courthouse ran into sticklers. This is a typical sub and salad place, but that was not my craving. A good bowl of chicken noodle soup was ideal!"}
{"text":"Got a bagel they can't warm them up but toast them... I don't do toasted bagels... I asked for strawberry cream cheese and got a very bland cream cheese with almost a chive taste to it and I ordered a plan bagel...
I never order mocha got a small asked to up size the cup to have more whip cream added get charged for the upside cup after having to stand in two different lines... a little confusing in here... Not a smile amongst the crew anywhere... giving 3 stats just because I'm not an asshole."}
{"text":"Sticklers is about to celebrate 10 years at it's location in the historic J.M. Walker building in downtown Phoenix.  It seems a little incongruous that this fine piece of - \"neo-classical greek architecture\", should host a \"mere\" sub shop, in this building that was once slated to be the 6 story local HQ for J.C. Penny. The quality, convenience, cleanliness and comfortable atmosphere of Stickers, coupled with it's continued popularity, success, and legions of loyal customers I think however does the old building proud. They stopped at 2 stories but intended tenant JCP moved in anyway for some years, before it became the APS building, and then occupied by various other tenants over the years.  

Now as to the food!  I confess  am not that huge a fan of subs in general except as economical filler, but I'd have to say that Stickler's has the best I've ever tasted, and that's not damning with faint praise; It's excellent!  I've come here only sporadically over the last decade of the nearly dozen years I've worked nearby, but only recently, based on reviews below, was I prompted to try the \"Traffic Jam\", for which I thank all responsible and I concur with the overwhelming majority: it's delicious!  Roast turkey, hard salami, honey baked ham and roast beef with swiss.  Add a little lettuce & tomato, oil & vinegar, a squirt of mayo, Italian seasoning, and maybe just a very few jalapenos due to the delicate gringo stomach to the  soft whole wheat roll, and you've got a filling piece of heaven on wheat.  Add a side and a drink and it starts getting a bit expensive for my lunch budget, but as for me, I'm satiated for the rest of the day. Like some of those below, I don't care for those roof-of-the-mouth raking breads either, but though I don't think they make it in house, you couldn't have anything much fresher or softer than the whole wheat sandwich roll (white Kaiser roll - you're on your own!).   

Sticklers is I think a tad more expensive than Subway on comparable items, and I'm just fine with Subway, but there's no doubt that Stickler's is superior in taste.  I met co-owner Murray this past week and asked him what made the difference - what makes their sandwiches that much distinctively better.  Without hesitation he answered \"the meat\".  And though not an exact quote, he also said \"That $2.99 a pound stuff that you buy from the grocery deli counter? We don't buy that.  Our's is more in the $5.99 area, and we slice it thin and layer it.   And I've got a great staff down here too, and I have to give thanks to them.\"  I liked that.  And the tuna, and the Traffic Jam, and the roast beef, and every other sandwich I've tried there over the years.

Service is fast and efficient.  You order at a walk-up counter on the east side where you can order your soup and sub, or choose a have a fresh salad assembled for you from the myriad offerings on the other side of the glass.  Staff does the assembling and at easily $8, it's not a cheap little side salad, but everything looks vibrantly fresh and the whole of downtown is not poking and sneezing in it.  Subs are made right out in the open so you can supervise if you want. but after ordering you walk around to the front counter, wait for your sub to come off the toasting rack and then specify what you want on it, order any drinks and sides, and pay. Cash, credit and debit cars are accepted. Would not say \"good for groups\", since no reservations accepted and no separate dining rooms or divisible areas available

In moderate weather Sticklers offers simple but comfortable plastic chair seating out front under the shade of the building's second story overhang that overlooks the busy streets at 3rd Ave & Washington.  There's also moderately shaded seating all along  the west side of the building with a view to the front of the adjacent Phoenix Municipal Court building that towers, looms, etc., over Sticker's modest 2-stories. 

Bins abound to dump your own debris, but staff roams continually at the lunch hour(s) to take care of that left behind. Restrooms are toward the back on the east side and at least the men's room is surprisingly large and includes 3 stalls including handicapped, one urinal, a baby changing station and small counter with sink and mirror.  The facility was well stocked with TP, paper towels, and hand soap even right after the big lunch hour, and there was no mess other than a few paper towels on the floor beneath the dispenser, and a bit of water on the counter around the sink.    

The 1-star review that spoke of rude wait staff, unwelcome gratuities, and a bad shrimp & lobster sandwich has been corrected by the author as a mistaken posting (wrong place), which I think leaves but one, 1-star remaining, which gives the establishment 1 star due to a single bad latte.  A little harsh, don't you think!  But note to the management: Forget lattes. Do what you do well, which you do very well."}
{"text":"The parking situation here sucks; if you can't find anything on the street (you won't) you'll have to park in the garage across the street.  Good luck with that if you don't own a Vespa or a Smart car.  

The interior is always crowded and you'll be lucky to find a table during the lunch rush.

That said, I don't care because the Traffic Jam sandwich is to DIE for.  Meat overload w/ delicious hot peppers - so, so good!   Yeah, the crusty bread may \"Cap'n Crunch\" the top of your mouth a little bit but it's totally worth it. 

They had another location in North Phoenix closer to my house and sadly, it seems to have closed.  I may or may not have shed an actual tear."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, if you're here you are probably either going to or coming from Phoenix Municipal Courthouse.  As I have no intentions of going back to court anytime soon I probably won't be there again, but don't think that means that I'm not a fan.  The food is pretty good, the staff is friendly, it's just not quite good enough to deal with that part of downtown just to go there."}
{"text":"The veggie sub is really good - loaded up with veggies and toasted so veggies are a little toasted but not soggy and wet. It's super busy at lunch but they move fast - would rather come here than some of the more well know sub places."}
{"text":"Chicken salad sandwich with provolone on a toasted french bun, mmmm!!!!!!  This is one of those typical downtown lunch time sandwich places, where you order and seat yourself or get take away.  Quality sandwiches that you really can't go wrong with, not much to rate on service since they don't serve you.  I will mention that they are quick on the sandwich side and create your own salad.  Next time I'll have to try their homemade banana walnut bread."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich place; seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in the valley (if not THE BEST), and, trust me, I'm a huge sandwich guy! There was a long line when I went in (12:00 on a Thursday), which told me the place was decent, but I had no idea that I would be sinking my teeth into one of the best in town! For reference, I got the turkey and Swiss, on wheat, all toppings, no mayo. PS - I live quite far from Sticklers (I was downtown for jury duty), but I have no issues with driving the distance soon just to get in a long line and enjoy my sandwich once again. I loved it!"}
{"text":"A nice lunch place for the downtown crowd (of which I am one) ... the place is VERY clean (rare for downtown eateries) and the prices for toasted subs are cheap (but they nail you for each add on) ..."}
{"text":"If you're in downtown Phoenix during breakfast and lunch hours, and you're looking for quick, good and cheap meal, then Sticklers is the place to go. 

I'm normally a pack a lunch person, but I forgot to restock on groceries and needed something to keep me going until I leave work at 12:30. I went with a Bagel Egg Sandwich. It's exactly what it sounds like, eggs, ham or bacon, and cheese on a bagel. Although I was disappointed to see the guy making my food using a microwave for the scrambled eggs, it's still pretty good, plus it's big and filling for just $4.25. Overall, the food is very cheap at Sticklers. The most expensive thing on the menu is large salad for $6.50. 

The place is really big for a quick service breakfast and lunch spot. There's a lot of room inside, and plenty of seating on a back patio and in front of the restaurant. Although the place does tend to fill up during peak lunch hours. 

The only thing I don't like about Sticklers is that it opens at 6:00am and only serves breakfast until 10:30. Other than the eggs, nothing on the breakfast menu requires any form of cooking. It's mostly bagels, muffins, and yogurt. They might as well just keep a bigger stock of those foods and keep serving them all the way up until they close at 4:00pm."}
{"text":"Sticklers is a sandwich and salad shop. They are locally owned and operated.  They serve both breakfast and lunch.  They are busy at lunch time but the line moves quickly.

I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and the daughter ordered ham sandwich. We weren't asked if we wanted ours toasted, they just came that way. I would have preferred non toasted. The sandwiches were very good. 

Morgan had a scoop of  Strawberry ice cream and I had a scoop of vanilla with chocolate syrup. Idk if it was home made or not but it tasted like it. 

If your looking for a good sandwich you'll find it here."}
{"text":"Not sure a place could be more average.  Food is good not great, prices aren't too high, but certainly not a bargain.  Service was courteous but not really helpful.  If you're someone who likes food that is safe and maybe a little boring, then this is the place for you.  Great quality boring food!"}
{"text":"The bagels are always overloaded every single time. Guaranteed you will need to have tons of napkins to wipe off what you get on your hands and want to wash yourself. You'll probably end up wiping off 2/3 of the cream cheese on the bagel. What do they think someone is doing with all that extra cream cheese? What's even worse is it's the consistency of yogurt so it's all over the place, dripping and spilling all over the bag they give it in. Makes it almost impossible to enjoy the bagel. More of a headache"}
{"text":"Got trapped downtown for jury duty recently, but ended up arriving way early due to unexpected lull in traffic. Since you can get into the courthouse until just before 8, it's a good thing this place opens at 6! 

I normally would have toughed it out, but it was a bit cool and windy out and, frankly speaking, not a lot of places to sit down and read a book unless you're wanting to plop down at the bus stop, right next to the roadway. Not ideal. I spotted this place and decided to head inside and see what I could get for breakfast. I didn't want to be \"that guy\" who sits down to read a book and doesn't actually ordering anything. 

They actually have a pretty decent system, order over here, pay over there type of thing. Seems to work pretty well. The place is well insulated from both the weather and the road noise, so it was ideal for plunking down and taking in a few chapters while waiting for the inevitable evils of jury duty service. 

Food wise, I ended up trying one of their breakfast bagel sandwiches. I opted for turkey and swiss with egg, and it came out in a reasonable amount of time. You don't get plates, just a little baggie thing (think airport to-go vendors) but that's OK I suppose. Taste wise, it was pretty good and well made, but I will say the egg itself was way, way too thick in the center. When the egg in your bagel is thicker than either half of the bagel itself, (we're talking 1.5\" here!), it makes for some really ... unappealing consistency. The outer periphery is fine, the flavor profile is good there, but in the center, it's basically 90% \"egg mush\" and not much else. Might be OK for some folks, just not for me. Still, I wasn't that hungry to begin with, so I ate the 'normal' pieces on the outside and that was plenty. 

I guess I can deduct a star for the egg sandwich being a bit too pudgy in the center, but it wouldn't be fair to take more than that. Service was friendly and courteous even before 7am and they do make a good sandwich aside from the excessive egg issue. I really dig the location and the ambiance/decor they have going on, and will definitely hit this spot again if I ever find myself downtown again. 

There's not much to like about being compelled to waste most of your day downtown at the courthouse, but this sandwich spot was a welcome distraction and a great place to get out of the weather and find some peace and quiet. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sandwich shop in Phoenix. If you like it hot, you HAVE to try the hot peppers, it's a delicious mix of peppers in a oil that is as flavorful as anything I've ever tried. Great family owed place you should try."}
{"text":"Perfectly good place to grab a quick sandwich downtown. Quick service even during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sandwich person but this place is great. Yes, it's a little crowded at lunch time but with state, municipal, and federal jurors looking for lunch in downtown, you have to expect that. The hot pepper mix is amazing, the restaurant is clean and the employees are very nice and move the line very quickly. Try the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown right off of Washington Sticklers serves as a hub for the business and working class alike.  They have bar seating wear you can people watch out the windows or sit down tables inside and out.  

How sticklers works.  First you go order a sandwich to the right as you walk in.  Then you grab a side, then your sandwich comes out of a toaster oven while the sandwich maker ask you what you want on it.  The sign above list in order of toppings.   The first time you go it can be quite awkward but the more times you go you realize how efficient this is.  It keeps the crowd moving.  If you want to hit this place for lunch I suggest going between 11 and 1130.  Forget it at noon its mostly working downtown folks and the line and seating can get way out of control.  

The food is pretty good. I enjoy the Roast Beef Sandwich with provolone the best.  With a side of Jalapeno chips.  Makes for a good meal.  They also have a pretty nice salad set up where you can pick through the glass what you want on the salad.  One thing most people don't really know about is sticklers has the best milk shakes in the downtown area.  Period.  These are hand spun real ice cream little wonders of joy.  The Chocolate Malt will melt your heart its so good.  You can also just get regular ice cream if you want also.  

Overall this is a nice sandwich shop with added bonuses.  It has become a regular place for me to go to as I work downtown."}
{"text":"Was here serving jury duty got the BLT on wheat mayo was amazing the sand which was pretty good. The smoothie I got tasted like ice cream I wasn't a big fan overall I'd come back again if I was serving jury duty the parking can be a hassle unfortunately"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this isn't a rip off of Potbellys (of course it could be that Potbellys ripped off them). Traffic Jam = A Wreck. Same thing. Even the hot peppers same thing.

Also, the bread disappointed me. It was dry, cracky, and cut the inside of my mouth (don't you hate when bread does that and leaves the top of your mouth raw?)."}
{"text":"Went to Sticklers for the first time today, with a friend who works across the street.  I'm a little leary of places that get talked up so much, but Sticklers was everything she talked about and more.  

A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed?

Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was \"Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...there's no way\"!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie.

The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - it's a 2-piller!  The atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud.  We were still able to have a conversation without shouting.  I just wished the people at the next table realized that.  We didn't need to hear about their daughter \"wrongly\" accused of DUI...for the third time!"}
{"text":"i recently posted a negative comment about Sticklers...i was WRONG! I had the wrong restaurant. I apologize profusely.
I have eaten here and I love their food and service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the food items they serve. The food is good, though...but not sure the good taste/quality makes up for the prices. Customer service is average overall. Sometimes their customer service is welcoming and upbeat. Other times they barely acknowledge you and act like they'd rather be doing something else. 
They have a very busy lunch hour but the line moves quicker than expected--though the hustle and bustle during the lunch hour can be confusing and overwhelming if you don't like crowds and shouting what you want on your sandwich. 
Overall I have a neutral opinion. The good and bad seem to balance out"}
{"text":"The worst sandwich I have ever had in my life. And I thought it was pretty difficult to make a bad sandwich. I ordered a turkey with everything on it and it tasted like the brick food you carry in your emergency kits. 
The bread was stale, the tomatoes/jalepenos/turkey had zero flavor and contributed nothing. I even tried to douse the sandwich in salt and pepper and it made it even worse. I was starving, it was 16 hours passed the last time I had eaten and I didn't finish half.
I don't know why this place is packed, 
But the only reason they get 2 stars is for their line service....they got people in and out relatively quickly.
....maybe I caught them on a terrible day, but I went out of my way to text people about how much I disliked my food. 
I wish I would of just save a few dollars and gone to subway.
NEVER. AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I was inclined to write this review because I am very displeased. I called the  location on 30 n 3rd Ave, 3rd Ave and Washington from work on 7/6/2016 at 11:32am to place a take out order for an Italian Sandwich.  \"Leonard\" took my order and I specifically told him three (3) times to NOT put pickles on my sandwich because I can not have vinegar, along with the fact that I severely dislike the smell and taste.  He expressed to me how much he disliked pickles as well, so I thought even though the last two times I ordered this exact sandwich they still put pickles on it resulting in me having to throw it away, that at least this time I had someone who understood my frustration would make sure right? WRONG. I understand that perhaps one person takes the take out orders, then another makes the sandwich, but three times? I drove 10 minutes from work, paid for parking, walked two blocks and paid for a sandwich stuffed with the one food I despise. 
      I called the location to express my frustration and the manager (no name) apologized and said well if you have your receipt I can refund you. Funny, because the woman that rang me up ( as nice as she was) did not provide a receipt. I assumed I was good to go paying cash and taking my sandwich that I was assured wouldn't have any pickles this time.  The manager then says if you bring the sandwich back I can remake it, great right? I only have a thirty minute lunch break and they do not deliver to my job, so needless to say driving back downtown, at noon, find and pay for parking for you to remake my sandwich while I hold your hand seemed a bit much at that point. I kindly wrapped the sandwich back up put it in a plastic bag and I am keeping it at my desk and I will be bringing the sandwich back to watch them remake it.  It might seem a bit much but for me to be someone who never complains or sends food back it bothers me like no other. The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because I have been in customer service for 10 years and everyone was nice and welcoming up until I spoke the manager about this issue."}
{"text":"Could be the best sandwiches in Phoenix, big menu, build your sandwich how you like it, then watch it get toasted. Great place"}
{"text":"Just meh.  Kind of confusing for a first time visitor, and the service was only barely welcoming / dedicated to making it an easy or straightforward experience.  Our sandwiches were decent (BLT and Turkey Breast) but nowhere near exemplary.  My order got messed up and they remade it, but it took a while on the second try.  It's just a very simple sandwich shop -- nothing too fancy or unique.  I kind of wanted to try their ice cream, but I was a little too disappointed in my sandwich (not much flavor, sort of slimy turkey) to get back in line.  

Nothing exactly wrong with this place, just very standard.  I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Praise the lords, praise all the gods THIS IS THEEEEE BEST SANDWICH ON EARTH, hands down!  ok...  Ok ok ok wait up I haven't traveled the entire world so ok fine BEST SANDWICH IN ARIZONA STATE! Still, pretty darn great!"}
