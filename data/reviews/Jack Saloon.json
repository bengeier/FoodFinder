{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewer, they call themselves Jack saloon and yet have this fancy trendy menu, marketing faux pas as they seem to have an identity crisis.  

Also, like most of the restaurants in Cartier 10/30 they charge premium downtown Montreal prices.  Their simplest burger was $13 with no sides, just a burger.

If you're looking for a place that would be on st-Laurent  street with an identity crisis and the prices that go along with it, but on the South Shore then you found it."}
{"text":"We were treated to 6 different courses, which gave us the chance to taste about 11 different menu items. Don't need to tell you that they nearly had to roll us out of the restaurant at the end. Everything was really good however.
 
*Due to an intolerance to fish, we asked for a version of the menu without fish. The elements that contained fish have been replaced by beef.*
 
First we started off with 3 different beef tartars. First was the Bloody, a spicier tartar with a clamato reduction, vodka, homemade steak spices and a few other things. The second, the Napolitano Pizza tartar, reminded us of a pizzeria pizza (think Italian style, not fast food) with it's tomato sauce and parmesan cheese. It was very enjoyable, however the tomato pieces were a little large for our taste. Lastly, the Southern Style, which had a nice smoky and spicy taste to it. All were excellent, although we did find that there were a lot of large pieces of ingredients other then the meat, so sometimes you would take a bite and it would be overpowered by one of the complementary ingredients.

Next we were served a few appetizers. Wings, onion rings and ribs! First, the wings. They are smoked in house and have a woody taste to them. They weren't sticky with sauce like we can see in other places, but it made them in no way dry. The had a slight crisp to them that was really enjoyable. To this day, I have to say that these are the best wings I've had so far! Next, the onion rings. A large onion covered in a delicious batter and drizzled with delicious caramel. A mix that one would not think of, but really gave a perfect balance of sweet and salty. (And for the people who don't like onions, you can always eat just the batter around the onion, I'm sure you'd enjoy it too.) And finally, the ribs! With a slightly spicy, yet smoky taste, they melted in your mouth. Contrary to the wings, these are as sticky as any good rib can be. The meat just fell off the bone, making the knife we got as good as useless for this dish. Simply excellent.
 
After that, we were served something that was the result of a night of drinking and a craving for a snack made out of what was out of the fridge. The Punching Bag is a bag of Doritos served as nachos. The mix was excellent! Also, as I stated before, we had a meat version of the menu, so we slices of what seemed like a burger patty. The table next to us had the original version served with smoked salmon and they kept raving on how good it was, so if you prefer fish, then you won't need to hesitate on this dish.

Keeping on, we were then served their Los Taquitos. A simple and light taco served in a soft shell. To us, this was the most lackluster dish, but was still delicious and perfect for someone wanting to eat something not to heavy.
 
We were then served a traditional filet mignon as well as a beef steak (the planned version being tuna which also had great reviews from our neighbouring table). The cook was perfect and the spices were great. For the beef steak however, you need to like heavily spiced, since there was a rather thick crust of pepper, which I must admit, enjoyed quite a bit.

 And lastly, the Krispy Kreme burger! Exactly as it sounds, this is a cheeseburger served between two Krispy Kreme doughnuts. This is what we enjoyed least of our evening. It wasn't bad, but the balance felt a little off. Keep in mind however, that this was the final dish of the evening and we were extremely full at this point, so it may be worth trying for yourself and make your own opinion about this out of the ordinary dish."}
{"text":"I guess no one uses yelp in Canada? No yelp reviews in dix30? I went to three places with ridiculous prices and settles on Jack since I'm on a budget. Still- for one man I was out $70 for my meal and two beers? 0"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place because it looked nice outside and the menu had something that seemed good.

We went in and were told to pick any place you want. Once seated we waited a couple of minutes without a menu or drink list till the waiter arrived.

The waiter asked us what we wanted for a drink... We decided to ask if they had a drink menu which they then brought to us.

Surely they will bring the food menu as well... Nope.

We picked our drink and then waited for one of the three waiters to take our order.

And we waited.

And waited some more while staring at the waiters who must have had a very important and amusing conversation going. 

There were only 2 other patrons there. There was more staff then patrons. (Counting the bartender and manager?)

After 10 minutes of waiting we remember that the place next door had some great food! So we left.

TL;DR - don't go here. Go next door."}
{"text":"The food and service that I experienced were pretty good. I ate at the bar and service was spot on. The bar stools were a little short and it makes you feel a little uncomfortable....like a small kid sitting at a bar. The ribeye and poutine were great! I'd definitely go back, but would try a table next time."}
{"text":"Started with some of their wings which come in 3 or 6 but it's an entire small wing. They came out in a small plate and almost looked burnt but these were smoked with a really nice flavor and juicy meat, just a little small. I got the maple salmon that wasn't anything special. Thought there would be some more maple flavor to it and I kept looking at the salmon thinking if it was cooked enough. Came with sweet potatoes fries which I thought it would come with something healthier but I dipped them in their BBQ sauce and the sauce they have is amazing."}
{"text":"Really, really bad! If I could, I would give it a big fat ZERO stars. 
Went there with my niece after visiting Quartier Dix30 for the first time, and not really knowing where the heck to eat, we decided to take the risk. Yelp didn't help us out as there were virtually no reviews for any of the places nearby. My gut as we passed this place was to keep walking but the few reviews I saw online (not Yelp) via my phone seemed like it might be an intriguing place. Mistake number 2 was seeing (once we were seated) that the rather large dining area had maybe 5 other patrons and NONE of them were eating, only drinking beer. The place tries so hard to be cool, but epic fail. Super dark inside, the waiter seated us at the window but since it was getting dark, I mentioned we couldn't really read the menus (there are lights but they were completely dimmed), he said \"yes\" but then laughed?!? The music is a strange strange mix of like 80s, 90s alternative, yet the decor tries to be Western!?!? The music was so loud we had to yell to hear each other.

I had read online that they had happy hour and other promos, so I asked our server if there were any that evening we were there. He responded NO. OK, nevermind, off to the menu.

We saw that pretty much every item on the menu tries desperately to look cutting edge in its mix of savory and sweet. In the end, most of these attempts are just really gross and vomit-inducing. Who the heck wants a piece of filet mignon ruined by a coffee crust topped with hazelnut and chocolate sauce??? That's just one horrific example! We ended up ordering an appetizer of Imperial Nachos to start which had some chili in it. They made the nachos with some Asian-fusion style, big mistake in my opinion. They call it the \"one and only unique Imperial Nacho\". Yeah, you got that right, it's unique but not for the right reasons! The chili was sweet yet sour (I think they put some of their homemade ketchup in that too) and I think it had cinnamon in it, the chips were kind of stale and there really wasn't much cheese to be found. I believe there were also bean sprouts (Asian-style, remember??). Goodness, I just CRINGE thinking back to our experience! 

For our mains, we both ordered the same thing, the \"safest\" thing on the menu (or so we thought), the cheeseburger. This place is a totally joke, as you have to order sides like fries as an EXTRA otherwise you only get the burger which is already overpriced. Our server also had the audacity to tell us that the price of $3 for add-ons to a main course which were printed on the NEW menus (this place only recently opened!) is wrong, and it's actually $4. 

Anyway, I ordered fries and my niece made the big, big mistake (poor thing) of ordering onion rings. The fries were edible, but the homemade mayo and ketchup they gush about was virtually unedible. The ketchup was SOUR, SOUR, SOUR, basically just pureed acidic tomato and the mayo was like eating creamed lemons, no mayo flavor to it. YECH.

The burger was a monstrosity, with a large slab of very chewy fat Canadian bacon, and the meat just tasted OLD. A bit like sandpaper and just...not fresh. My niece even questioned whether we would get sick afterwards.

I got tired of trying to take a bite of that thing as it literally was like 5-6 inches in height and kept falling over, with various ingredients going all over the place. And the two or three bites I did have was simply due to sheer hunger.

My niece's onion rings were thickly (and I mean, THICKLY) coated with maple syrup and had a super dark color to them. I forced her to eat one because I felt bad returning the whole thing to the kitchen, but in hindsight, I should have told them just how bad their concept is. They were not crisp/fluffy at all, just limp and soggy from the syrup.

This is the same establishment that has a Krispy Kreme burger, some other monstrosity with a piece of meat in between a gross, sickly sweet donut.

We walked out of there $80 poorer, still hungry but with a weird burpy feeling in our stomachs. We quickly downed a Pepsi each in the car on the way home hoping to burp the grossness away (sorry TMI).

The ultimate smack in the face?? Once home, I quickly googled them again hoping to find the truth from someone, ANYONE, about this place. I found their Facebook page and lo and behold, the manager had posted at 5pm the day we visited (and we got there at 5:30PM) that females had a 50% discount on all food starting from 5PM that evening!!! Of course they have a promo; no one in his/her right mind would eat here for full price! I wouldn't eat there again for FREE.

Our server said NOTHING about this promo so either he was clueless or just didn't want to mention the deal. All he did was come every 5 mins and ask \"It's good?\" to everything on our plates.

Just writing this review (and I know it's long!) makes me shudder...

Save your money, your tastebuds, your stomachs and please skip this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday supper. I was expecting it to have a country vibe, since it's called \"Jack Saloon\" but it was a mishmash of trendy hipster, with a lot of classic rock tunes playing over top. 

The service was quick and friendly, even though we were late for our reservation. They did make sure to remind us multiple times that we had to be done with our table by 8, but I guess that's understandable since we were late, and another group was coming in. We had to wait a while for our food, which means I had to rush a bit more, and didn't get to finish my food.

I had the large sized, pulled pork sandwich, which came with coleslaw and a side of fries for $16. I regret ordering the large, because the amount of meat in it was ridiculous. The bottom was very soggy and it was impossible to pick up, so I had to try and cut it into pieces. My friend just opened up the sandwich and ate the meat inside with a fork instead. From the other dishes I saw, all the sandwiches seemed to be piled sky high in a similar fashion. The pork was good, but it had a strange sweetness to it that was a bit too much. I found it lacked a bit of zest or sourness.  

A lot of the items on the menu are a bit pricey, especially the burgers. They also have some pretty bizarre combinations, such as an egg roll burger and the \"krispy kreme\" which is a burger with doughnuts used as a bun. The menu doesn't really reflect the image of a saloon."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a low rating... I thought it was amazing! The cool decor drew me in to try it out and the super looking menu made me stay and have lunch. I had the Krispy Kreme burger because... How could I not?? It was amazing!! Definitely best burger I have ever had. My friend had the general Tao burger and was equally as impressed. The fries that came with the burger were tasty and came with a yummy mayo in a cute shot glass. The sangria we had was equally as tasty and went down very quickly :) They had tons of friendly staff who helped out whenever they could. I will definitely return on my next shopping trip to see what else they have on that interesting menu of theirs..."}
{"text":"I'm never dissapointed when I go there!
I usually go during the day, because in the evening it's quite crowded and loud. If you like to hear great music, then go at night. I don't mind it, I just prefer lunch time over there.
The staff is super friendly and the decor is quite fun. Let's just say, that they don't call it \"jack saloon\" for nothing. The service can be a bit slow sometimes. 
The food is great. I've been there a couple of times and I always try something different. I recently tried the Outlaw : fried chicken waffles. Realllly good!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat. I gave it a second try cause it's 50% off everything for girls on Monday. Every single plates has this weird smoked taste that gets on the stomach after two bites. The portions are ridiculously big which makes a lot of leftovers. When we told the waiter this was not eatable he didn't even say a word and didn't charge us. On the way to the car my friend threw up and that happened to me later during the night. 

Go have drinks and dance there just don't eat the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go out, the service at the bar is excellent, the waitresses take a lot of time, not because is busy but because they are slow, prices are high, on tuesday each shot of jack is 2$."}
{"text":"Food wise 1.5 stars
Service 4 stars

Came here for our office Christmas party. We were a group of 12. Walking in on a Friday night it felt more like a teeny-bopper club than a restaurant. Seated quite quickly and our excellent waiter (the only excellent thing about this place) explained the specials with a touch of humor. Drink orders were taken quickly and served quickly. 

Waiter came to make sure our drinks were ok and took our meal order. Everything here is a side, the burger itself is $12.50 with no fries, you pay $5 extra dollars for about 15 fries. A total rip off, really. I ordered the Jack Mac (or something like that, it looks like a Big Mac) the burger was huge and it was presented nicely.

How was the taste? Bland, it fell apart after a bite and became a soggy mess. I decided to just eat the meat and noticed that the meat itself was rubbery so the patties are frozen.

I just left it there, ordered a beer and listened to the garage band play for about 20 minutes till we all just got up, paid and left. Waiter was excellent though, not his fault about the food, but the premium prices and awful food doesn't make it worth the trip.

Will anyone of us being come back for dinner? No. Maybe just for a quick drink before going somewhere worth while."}
