{"text":"Excellent, long-lasting Mexican restaurant in Cornelius.  Great service and quality food prepared extremely well!  The best place for a great tasting margarita.  The street tacos are the ticket!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and lunch deals are amazing! I especially like the chimichangas and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Ordered the grill street corn taco with chicken.  Loved it. Been here few times the service and food always excellent."}
{"text":"This Zapata's appears to be one of three in the Charlotte area.  It is almost hidden in a shopping center that takes considerable effort to get into.  The restaurant itself is both bigger and much nicer inside than the storefront would suggest.  The service is prompt and efficient.  The portions are generous, the prices are modest, and the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Updated menu with lots of great, refreshing choices. The Maui quesadilla was fantastic!"}
{"text":"By far one of favorite spots for me and the family! Enjoyed their menu for over 10 years, my weakness the Chicken Taquitos (appetizer not on the menu but staff will know) ;)   2 large flour tortillas filled with marinated chicken covered in their amazing queso! Cut into 6 sections with a side of citrus pico and Guac. Enough for 2 but I'm greedy and make it my meal. Keep up the good work Zapata's!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken fajitas with refried beans and rice. It was really good, definitely better than most American chains like Chili's and Applebee's. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the salsa was just kind of bland both in the mild and medium varieties."}
{"text":"Not your best bet for the area.  Atmosphere is nice, salsa is mediocre and food is not very authentic."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I used to eat here all the time, but then moved away.  Work brought me back into town, so I had to stop in for lunch.  It hasn't changed.  Food is absolutely delicious and the price is right.  A little backstory:  I didn't eat Mexican food for over 15 years because I couldn't find any I liked...Zapatas is the restaurant that intrigued my Mexican tastebuds.  Best Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Nice family friendly atmosphere. Awesome service. Thanks Wendy!!!  Pico de gallo is outstanding. Carnitas is the way to go. Cooked perfectly tender and seasoned to perfection. Get the fresh made guacamole. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful, I'm shocked by the positive reviews.  The house margarita is bright yellow because of an over abundance of sour mix, it's almost too sweet to drink.  The salsa is like water, no thickness at all.  I had the spinach enchiladas, and you normally expect these to be filled with sauteed spinach and cheese, but at Zapata's, they're filled with spinach dip you buy in tubs at the grocery store to eat with potato chips.

While the service was solid, the food leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican food in North Carolina. Great food and great service. You cannot go wrong with that! I especially love that their food is not loaded with cheese sauce and you can actually taste the flavor of the food. Their arroz con pollo is one of my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"They have the best El Presidente margaritas around. High quality ingredients and no sweet & sour mix.  Food is okay - drink enough margaritas and you won't care. Guacamole is disgusting - very chunky with lots of diced tomatoes and onions. Street Tacos are a fave. Service is okay."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food in Cornelius. We've been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. Tonight, I had a jumbo house margarita, which was generous on the tequila but not too strong and not too sweet, and the combination platter with a beef taco and chicken chimichanga. Both were very good. Portions are good and not obnoxiously large, like some Mexican restaurants. Zapatas and El Toro are the 2 best Mexican options in the area, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had the fajita burrito and it was great. Service was knowledgeable and prompt. Adding this place to my repeat list. Salsa, chips, drink, and large meal for 11 bucks is awesome ."}
{"text":"YUM! Soooooo good! Excellent menu - lots to choose from. This SoCal girl is very happy! Cadillac margarita was excellent, too. I will be back....."}
{"text":"This was really disappointing Mexican food. Their decor should've tipped me off to turn away once I entered (ripped seats and worn out tables and carpet, dark lighting), but I foolishly went in anyway. Big mistake.

I think their salsa was just diced tomatoes from a can. The rice was flavorless and not worth the calories. I ordered one pork taco and two chicken enchiladas, hoping that I could enjoy leftover enchiladas the next day. Nope. The taco meat was questionable at best, and the chicken enchiladas were cold inside, like they had just been reheated from frozen status in an ineffective microwave. I didn't eat much of my meal and felt like I wasted my money.

Their chips were good. Their refried beans were delicious ... but it's pretty hard to mess up refried beans. They ALWAYS have a coupon in the Valpak mailers, but even with that I don't think I'd go again."}
{"text":"Good service.  Bad food.  Chimichanga was bland and soft not crispy.   Calamari taco was mediocre.  By the Yelp reviews, we had expected better food.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is your best mexican option for the Lake Norman area. They are run extremely well and have great ownership. I highly suggest trying the ritas...I have not found a better tasting margarita anywhere else. Another must try is the homemade verde salsa, absolutely unreal. Chips always come out hot and every dish I've tried has been fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food great service. The salsas are excellent and authentic Mexican flavors. Beautiful artwork all around to look at. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a while, but we always came here. Most times we'd get the Tacos el Carbon. The meat was so good! But this time we decided to read the menu & find something different. And let me tell you, it's fantastic. It looks like we'll be coming back more often. We even started dancing with the music!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night here for dinner. Seems like everything closes early on a weekday. Called restaurant to make sure they open for it was 9:15 PM. They said they were going to close at 10 PM. 

It was a rough day. Sort of like a Seinfield episode or Murphy's Law. My friend's car broke down, he had to get rental, could not get rental for his license expired on his birthday. Went to DMV and had to take test. Sweating bullets and worried about not test will not get licence therefore no rental car. OMG! No wheels in NC. DMV was great up in Huntersville, just need to pass test by identifying road signs. Got 10 out of 12- Thank goodness passed. Now, able to rent car. Life is good again.

Reached Zapata's by 9:38 PM and we were the only one's at the restaurant. We had the Guacamole- Freshly made and so good. Fiesta time with a glass of Margarita and a Corona. Like the filling in both the Chicken Quesadilla and Shrimp Quesadilla with rice and beans. Life is good. Day was not so bad and for it ended with a delicious meal and drinks to boot.

Will be back here for lunch and late night dinners."}
{"text":"The food was decent but I couldn't get past the cleanliness and the filthy table that my arm kept sticking too. Way too pricey for this kind of Mexican food."}
{"text":"I always remember Zapata's due to my rudimentary knowledge of Spanish. According to what I learned, this place translated into English is called Shoes! Who wouldn't want to eat at Shoes?

Actually, Zapata's is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. The interior decor is a bit nicer and more upscale than your usual places, and the cheese dip is excellent!

The chips come out hot, the mild salsa isn't like marinara sauce and the hot salsa isn't too spicy to enjoy.

One of my standby dishes at any mexican place, the chicken quesadilla, is large and stuffed with chicken. 

While Zapata's does a good business, it is rarely so crowded that you have to wait on a table, which makes it the perfect place to go at the last-minute, whether for lunch or dinner.

Appetizers run anywhere from $4 to $10, and entrees from $8 to $15, so it is a bit pricier than your average strip mall mexican joints, but in my opinion it is worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican with Service

We've been going to Zapata's on and off for probably 20 years.  Located where it is, you have to look for it.

Food is excellent.  My wife is not a fan of Mexican or Tex Mex but put a peanut sauce on it and she's ready to go. As for myself, i prefer a traditional beef dish be in tacos' enchiladas etc or seafood like shrimp.

This place fill the bill across the board.  Good Food and great service.

Atmosphere is OK and typical of Mexican restaurants.

All in all, it's good and a regular dining place and I would recommend to anyone in the area or traveling through."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Sunday dinner. Kids eat free so the price is very good on Sunday. The mole is pretty good and the burritos are gigantic. I don't think I've ever had anything that wasn't good, but the more authentic plates are definitely better than the Americanized options. Surprisingly, the burger is not bad."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good selection of food, the quality is good, and the service is prompt. Its a shame that this place didn't have a better location. It is smaller and hard to find. I thinks its a great place to sit down and get a great meal quickly. I think kids eat free on Sunday."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan for Mexican cuisine, but this place is  awesome.  The ambiance is great,the service is very knowledgeable on the menu and even helps to provide you specialty dishes.  The food is extremely delicious. Always freshly prepared.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Cornelius area."}
{"text":"This place is nowhere I'd go anytime soon. This is the greater Charlotte area and there are 50 different mexican restaurants, I put this near the bottom. Service took their time, the Margaritas everyone raves about was watered down (I know 10 other places with better margs) and the food just was not appetizing. What hurt the most was how much I paid for that entire meal. You'll go broke for a taco bell quality taco, it's a trap haha."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Food tasted AMAZING! Service was super friendly and helpful and the food came out pretty fast. Try one of their margaritas, they are delicious! I'll definitely be coming back here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service every time I'm here. Servers take the time to talk to you and genuinely get to know you, which keeps me coming back every week. I'll definitely update this review if anything changes. Margaritas are moy excellente!"}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food with awesome waitstaff. Pollo Asada Burrito was different what I've had before, but still good. The place was crowded with two full tables that spanned the restaurant, but our waitress was pleasant and attentive. Portions were good sizes and the price was awesome. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I moved from Cornelius to Uptown Charlotte about a year ago and there are a handful of places I miss eating at \"up at the lake\". This is one of them. I stopped in yesterday for my birthday dinner and I'm so glad to say the quality of the food surpassed even my memories. Starting with the warm, bottomless basket of nacho chips, we added a side of cheese dip (yum!). I had the fish tacos and a margarita. From the food to the service, absolutely EXCELLENT on all accounts. There are several Mexican restaurants to choose from now (and I've ate at at least two other ones on Exit 25 and 28) and review Zapata's the highest."}
{"text":"Back though the area and had to stop at my favorite restaurant in the Queen City. Best food, fast attentive family friendly service,  great prices and portions. Place leaves me happy every time I come here!"}
{"text":"So far, Zapata's is the best Mexican food I've found in NC. They don't make everything the same - as in using the same base product for a burrito and an enchilada. The chimichangas are BIG and packed w/veggies and meat. The burritos are offered in many varieties and have yet to disappoint. 

By far, my favorite dish has to be the fajitas. There is enough to share or to bring home for lunch the next day. They are happy to send you home w/extra tortillas for reheating. The guacamole is the most authentic I've found around here - it doesn't seem to be a green, smooth blob from a container. Chips and salsa are fresh and in endless supply. 

My hubby likes the carnitas and carne asada. He has also enjoys the shrimp fajitas, a huge salad and tacos. My 3yo son loves the food here and -BONUS- kids eat free on Sunday. The service is always excellent and they will go out of their way to accommodate you. In the eight years I've been in western NC, Zapata's in Cornelius has become my favorite for mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food! Guacamole was delicious and the server was very friendly. My chimichangas were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I've been to these chain Mexican restaurants before, but I have never had these types of tacos before. The \"hawaiano\" ones might best ones I've had outside of eating at a food truck. Defiantly recommend, and service is good for it being a Friday night."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas and I love the beans and rice. Staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"It is just good, solid * not fancy* mexican fare. Service is good and friendly.  Always welcoming.  We go a couple times a month. Is it the absolute Best I have ever had, no, but I do not live near Abuleos. Good solid food that we keep going back to. Better than most in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas.  Can I just tell you how much I miss really good Mexican food?  Zapata's makes me homesick. The food is soooo good and so close to \"home\" for me.  Excellent and by far the bast Mexican restaurant I have found since I moved here.  Yuuuuummmmmmyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday around 1:30. Place was dead. There were at least 3 servers but the service was terrible. I ordered 2 items for $5.99, chicken enchilada and carnitas chimichanga. The food was delicious but the service was really bad. No refills on chips and salsa or drinks. No one ever came to check on me so I assume they don't value me as a customer. Too bad; it seemed like a pretty nice place. So many choices for great Mexican food so I will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here. Both times the food was very good. First time I had the enchiladas. They were good but I wouldn't say my favorite. Last night I had the street tacos and a cup of tortilla soup. Tacos were great and I would order them again fresh, and all the flavors were great. The soup, by far was my favorite. I will go back for the soup again. I want a bowl next time as a meal instead of the cup. Although, the cup size is very large. The soup tasted like something my grandma got up early and cooked all day. So rich and flavorful. Get the soup! Decor needs a revamp."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Guacamole was fresh and authentic!  It was nice to be able to sit outside and enjoy the scenery. Staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating there, service was a little slow it took him awhile to take the drink order. Food was good, but not amazing, I have had better Mexican food. The restaurant is really nice though and has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and absolutely love Mexican food. I have been trying out as many Mexican restaurants to find my top 5 favorites. I feel confident for now to add this one to my list. Friendly staff with reasonable prices serving very tasty food! Fresh guacamole, salsa, chips delisciuos. Hearty flavorful food portions. Cleaned and traditional 
decorations. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Hmmm...sat at the bar to watch the game and eat some good Mx food.  Food was great and drinks were good when I could get them.  The service at the bar was horrible!  I had to beg my server for attention.  I am not even sure there is a bartender that works there as a \"bartender\".  I used to love this place but now, eh.  Sad."}
{"text":"Well, I finally figured I would give this place a shot. I have lived in the area for almost 2 years and been by many times. I stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! The place was very clean and the staff is very friendly with management swinging by every table to make sure everything was perfect. The food was hot and tasty and served very fast. What a great value..."}
{"text":"I once looked forward to visiting this great Mexican restaurant. It has truly hit bottom. The food is careless, the portions have shrank, the quality is gone and it is obvious that no one is paying attention to food. I used to be a regular here, but I will never go back! As the only Mexican restaurant in Cornelius just skip your cravings or head off to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If I could leave less than a star, I would. Let's start off with the service at the front (I was picking up take out). My total was $28. I gave him $40, he asked if I wanted change. As a server, I would never ask if they needed change- that's so rude. Moving on. Took forever to bring change back- it was $1 short.

Finally got my food home, and it was possibly the worst Mexican food. Taco Bell would've been 100x better. Our Pollo Fundido was 3 lumps of chicken with half-melted Kraft singles on top. Absolutely disgusting, but the chicken and the rice itself tasted OK.

Queso was cold, too.

First and last visit there. Currently looking for other options to eat tonight because this was beyond awful. (Picture is halfway through trying to pick it apart to make it somewhat edible)"}
{"text":"Zapata's is, I think, a local only chain as my Google search only found three unless they are connected to the one in Shanghai, China (http://www.zapatas-shanghai.com/).

Atmosphere - Upon arriving, I noticed it was pretty crowded for a Sunday evening w/ every table filled with families (I later found out that Sundays are \"kids eat free\" day.  I wish I was a kid!!).  The décor is traditional Mexican/ American styled restaurant, similar to the tasty places I have visited in Chicago, so my expectations were heightened by this atmosphere.  The staff was dressed nicely in a red or an amber polo w/ black pants.

Service - The host that greeted us at the front was friendly and quickly placed us at a table.  During our meal we were served by two waiters, one that handled ordering and entrée serving and one server for the refill of drinks.  This was excellent service for this price point. 

Food - Besides the free chips and salsa, I had the Pollo Yucatan (grilled, boneless, & skinless butterflied chicken breast marinated in citrus juice, Yucatan achoite paste (mostly tomato and spices).  This came w/ warm corn tortillas and Mexican rice.  Plus, I was able to substitute refried beans w/ black beans at no additional cost.

The chicken was tasty and tender and all the sides were great.  The salsa was a little runny, but was still ok.  My date's steak fajita, which I sampled, was also tender w/ excellent flavor.    

Overall - Two entrees and two drinks w/ numerous ice tea refills came to $35 that included a nice sized tip.  

Zapata's is my favorite place for Mexican in the CLT area (and apparently in China too)!!"}
{"text":"I got the Marco Polo tacos for the first time.  Bacon wrapped shrimp in a taco with delicious coleslaw and a sauce.  Absolutely delicious!!  I'll definitely be back to get that again!!!  Also great service, friendly staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Three diners and two became sick that night and the next day.   Bathroom was filthy and the wall at our booth was also.  I guess we should have been more observant.  Good point ~~ the waiter was fantastic.  We called the manager the next day and he was very placating but wasn't really concerned."}
{"text":"So far, the dine  is experience is where this place shines. The carne Assada is on point and probably the best if. It close to the best I've had around here. The service is always friendly and prompt. 

Take out: our car wash asada was okay, but the rice and beans were refrigerator cold (I live less than 5 mi utes away), we were missing guacamole and the tortillas. We also only got one small thing of salsa for the 2 of us (good thing I keep extra on hand. I maintain a good review because when I called them, I was assured that this is not the usual and that there was a new cook. The manager also made things right by us. We will keep this place as our go to
As long as w front have these types of inconsistencies."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Mexican in the area. Ingredients are always fresh and service is solid. I love the arroz con pollo though some may think the sauce is a little too much on the tomato side. They flash fry a jalapeño if you want it o the side and it is the perfect mix of cooked and raw jalapeño flavor and texture. Chips and salsa are always generous and refilled. They do very good flavored pork for their pork dishes."}
{"text":"We were looking to try a new Mexican place in the area and Zapatas came up. Between the reviews and the fact that they had carnitas on the menu I was sold on checking it out. We made a reservation for seven of us and arrived at 6:30 for our dinner. It was a bit busy when we first got in, so we waited a few minutes before being seated. A server soon came by and dropped off chips/salsa and took our drink orders. The chips came out nice and hot and the salsa was pretty good with plenty of chunks in it. The staff were extremely friendly and collected, despite the busy environment, and even the manager came over to see how things were going.

It took a bit longer for a server to come back and take our meal orders. Like I said, it was busy and we were in no rush, so we didn't mind. We all split an order of the taquitos which were pretty amazing. The shell was crisp and the chicken filling was delicious...was nice and tender and a bit spicy. 

For dinner I ordered the carnitas, and I have to say that they were the best I ever had. They came served in a tomato-esque sauce, and this turned me off initially as I tend to look down on over-flavored/sauced carnitas. However, this was not the case. The sauce offered a very slight spicy element, but in no way overpowered or hid the full-on porky flavor, which was dynamite. The pork was ridiculously tender, had a bit of char on the edges, and was one of the least fatty carnitas dishes I've ever had! Then you add on all the other fixins' that came with it. The pickled onions were done very well and added a great taste to the plate. The rice and beans were what you would expect...nothing mind blowing but got the job done. The carnitas also came with sour cream and guac, which you don't always get. Put all these items into a folded flour tortilla and you have yourself one heck of a tastetacular meal! Oh, and the portion size was INSANE! I got close to twice as much meat as I normally get at other Mexican restaurants and definitely have another for a lunch and a half.

The miss' ordered the chicken pablano, which consisted of chicken breast smothered in a mole sauce. She wasn't as big a fan and said she had had better mole elsewhere. I had a bit of a taste and it was ok, but it didn't really do anything for me. Then again I'm not a fan of mole in general, so I don't really have anything to compare it to.

All in all, I was very impressed and pleased with the food and service at Zapatas. The staff are all warm and friendly folks and are clearly concerned with making sure everyone gets what they want and are comfortable. The food was hot, fresh and delivered in heaping portions. This is the best Mexican I've had in the area and will likely become our go-to for carnitas and other Mexican eats."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Fajitas I have ever had. Little tiny pieces of chicken and steak, tough, over cooked. I'm used to the big strips of meat generally served with this dish. Very disappointed here. Our plate had a pool of oil at the bottom as well, very gross. Rice was ok but not the best. Workers were vacuuming while we are trying to enjoy our meal which was weird and annoying and gave me a headache listening to the vacuum for so long. Probably won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!! The menu is diverse and offers something for everyone. This is the best Mexican restaurant in LKN!!"}
