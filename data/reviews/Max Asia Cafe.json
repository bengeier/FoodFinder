{"text":"Great food and very fresh and they make it anyway you want it. New favorite lunch spot. Great place for the vegetarians as they accommodate them very nicely."}
{"text":"I'm apparently the only one who did not think was very good. General Tso's chicken let me down."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and delicious!

I'm so glad I checked this place out last week. Food was cooked perfectly and the staff are super friendly.  My only complaint is no sweet and sour came with my crab puffs. I did take out so it might be something you have to ask for. Crab puff were still some of the best I've had. This is my new spot for Asian cuisine :)"}
{"text":"Really great service and the food is amazing. Right when you walk in they are very fast to take care of you to make sure your order is correct. The food is awesome as well. When you eat asian food at some places it can be very greasy, but not this place the food tastes very fresh."}
{"text":"We got takeout from the lunch menu, and it was pretty lack luster, standard Americanized Chinese food. We got the General Tao's, Kung Pao Pork, and Szehuan beef. The food wasn't bad, but there are so many better places around.

They do take out and delivery and their prices on lunch are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out based on the great reviews. We did not regret it! We ordered take out and when we went in to pick it up, the employees were so friendly and it was so welcoming. The food was freshly cooked and the portions were huge for the price you pay. The chicken egg rolls were the best I've ever had. You're missing out if you haven't discovered this play yet."}
{"text":"Max delivers to my home in a reasonable amount of time.  The crispy duck is amazing.  Served on a bed of crunchy shredded cabbage with salty and slightly sweet sauce.  The other menu items we have tried were also good.  But, I'm all about the duck."}
{"text":"Food is a solid 3*s
Another one bonus star for customer service


I'm no Chinese gourmet expert, I'm just saying my tongue likes it okay. 


Note:  their delivery coverage is pretty extensive"}
{"text":"Owner is from Hong Kong; therefore this place serves some unique Hong Kong café style dishes and I like it a lot! The chef got good skill on making Hong Kong style food, which is hard to find in Phoenix! 
Solid 4.5 star, half star for the fact that it is the only restaurant which serves HK café food :)
I will give it 5 if they can extend its menu to include other HK café dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Dishes come with white or fried rice and everything tastes delicious. I personally got the ma pao tofu and chow fun."}
{"text":"Proper Cantonese food with some good foreign variants like char kway teow. The egg roll, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork crowd should venture away from familiar territory into the Chinese menu, because this is where this restaurant truly shines. The fried stuffed tofu dish was very tasty, and the bowls of noodles served up are really great, particularly the Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup, with its large shrimp and pork wontons. Legit flavors. Great prices. I really enjoy the cha chaan teng (???) atmosphere, it's much better than that other place in Mesa. Very good, friendly service. This is my go-to place for comfort food."}
{"text":"With a recent move to Chandler, we Yelped this place and finally found some really good Asian/Chinese food. Has to be the best in Phoenix.  The Chef has lived in numerous Asian places, reflected in the VARIETY of food selections. The salt and pepper wings and triple Kung Pao were delish."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to make good Chinese food.  But the food I had tonight was not well made,  too much sauce for one dish, but too bland for the other. Although the ingredients remain fresh, the execution of the stir fry was subpar.  I hope the chef will pay more attention to it."}
{"text":"Recently opened, they served wonderful Asian cuisine, Great Taste and very good service. It's a small restaurant nested on the NW Corner of Arizona Ave and Ray Rd. Our favorite is the XO Seafood Fried Rice, the fish dishes are also wonderful. Definitely one of my favorites if not the best Asian/Chinese restaurant in East Valley."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Chandler.
Family owned, purely authentic and every dish is made with love and passion for food. I have never eaten such good food."}
{"text":"First time I was here (shortly after they open), food was decent. I am Chinese, I like my food Hong Kong style (not the Americanized Chinese version) I have been back here a few more time whenever I am in the chandler area. 

Now the food is lot more Americanized  (not necessary bad,  just not what I crave for). so I will give them a three star for being average."}
{"text":"I've had the volcano shrimp twice. The first time the broccoli wasn't cut enough  (a little challenging with chop sticks but def not a deal breaker) and the second time confirmed that veggies are not their forte. A little soft/overlooked. However, the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce is the BOMB. I'm definitely going back for more.  And, unlike many Asian establishments, the staff is friendly, even the chef in the back. Always a plus."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY AT NIGHT. The food is very good-- but the delivery is HORRIBLE. A couple months ago, the wife and I ordered dinner for delivery, the driver was 45 minutes late and said he got lost? We are literally less than (2) miles and three turns from the restaurant. I could WALK there in less than 15 minutes! The driver never called us for directions or to say he was running late. We called the restaurant twice to check on our order, and each time we were told that \"he is gone, and should be there soon\". 

Well, as of last Friday, it had been a couple months since the last delivery fiasco and we were craving Max's and didn't feel like doing takeout since it was raining, so we decided to give Max's delivery another shot. Big mistake. 

They said delivery would take 45-60 minutes, which was fine with us. But, after 75+ minutes and no food, we called the restaurant and were told that the driver is in route and will be there soon. The driver arrived after 90 minutes, and when I questioned her on the time, she said that the restaurant should have told me that delivery could take up to an hour-- I told her that Yes they did tell me that... but she took an hour AND A HALF. The driver couldn't have cared less. 

We eat at Max's at least 3-4 times a month-- but we will not be ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"Great food; I really enjoyed it. I had the orange chicken and the beef lo mein. The large pieces of all white meat chicken were very lightly breaded, which was perfect. Most places seem to over-coat their chicken. Great, not too sweet flavor, but not at all spicy like the menu claims, so don't worry. The beef lo mein had tender lean beef, perfect texture, not waxy like at some places. 

As others have mentioned, don't come here for the fried rice. Although, like normal rice, it's bland and featureless, it makes a good combo with the orange chicken. I just wouldn't want it as an entree. The pork egg rolls are also skinny and lightly filled. If it weren't for those gripes, this would have been an easy 5 star review. Everything else I had was amazing. But in my mind everything has to be perfect to get 5 stars. 


Final note: if you really need your Chinese to be super spicy, then just don't come here. But don't give it 1 or 2 star rating because your Chinese food didn't peel the skin off the inside of your mouth. Most people are human beings and just enjoy good, flavorful Chinese food. If you need more than that, keep a bit of habanero pepper on hand or something. So word of advice, many things on the menu have a hot pepper next to them showing that they are spicy but they aren't. Just really good, quality flavor."}
{"text":"If I could add an extra star, I would. I have never eaten in the restaurant, but I have ordered delivery several times. I am a creature of habit so I usually always order the Hong Kong Noodle Soup and the crab puffs because they are delicious- but tonight I changed it up a bit. On the recommendation of the sweet lady on the phone, I order the Indonesian fried rice. It was unbelievably flavorful and had a nice kick to it. I also ordered the braised beef stew and it was THE best soup I have ever had in my life! I cannot even find the words to tell you how amazing this soup is! I work right across the street at the apartment complex and I will be recommending this to all my residents and coworkers. Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"I've had better, and I've had worse.  All of our meals seemed to be better next day.  Hot and sour soup was very good."}
{"text":"My entire family had a great experience at Max Asia Cafe. The food was authentic and delicious.  It is friendly and consistent. I am addicted to Crispy Butterfly coconut Shrimp, Sesame chicken Cold Noodle and Singapore Curry Noodles.  I really can't list all the dishes we like, but you really can't go wrong with the authentic menu.  Amazing food for a decent price.  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese /taiwanese food. The place is a hole in the wall. But with great food. Recommend the crispy chicken wings, the won ton soup."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got such high ratings. I love pan fried noodles so we ordered Chicken Cantonese Chow Mein. The chicken was slimy and the veggies were obviously past their prime, the sauce tasted bottled. We also had crab puffs which were good but I didn't see any crab and the dipping sauce also seemed bottled and goopy. I much prefer the chicken pan fried noodles and pot stickers from C-fu. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews much but I will for this place. For years now I have been trying to find a place that can make me some tasty Singapore curry noodles just like my favorite Thai place that closed down. And many years are gone a lot of places tried, I think I've found my noodles. I just wished that it hadn't taken so so long because now I am just a couple months short of my move to San Diego, CA. But at least now I know that when I come back to visit I can come here for them. The flavors in their fried rice is also good. I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"I have been to this place time many times here are the dishes that I recommend: good for sharing: garlic shrimp, marinated duck, egg plant with pork. Good for going alone: any fried rice, any noodle soup but I particularly love beef tomatoes noodle soup."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight. Took an hour to deliver, which I guess is normal... However it was such a disappointment once I took my first bite (I was starving mind you, so normally the first bite of anything always tastes delicious) I was very disappointed. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken combo, the egg roll was very tasteless, the rice was just as bad and the teriyaki chicken was quite honestly ... Gross! I was amazed this place gets such high reviews, I've had way better Chinese at other establishments."}
{"text":"They have the best Hot and Sour soup I have had ever!!!!!  

Very nice people, will be my favorite spot from now on.  And they deliver locally.  

LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Hong Kong and have been living in Arizona for over 20 years. Max's wonton noodle soup (???) is by far the BEST I have ever tasted. The owner Ivan is also from Hong Kong and he told me his secret is freshness and authentic ingredients! I also enjoy the family-like atmosphere. What a hidden gem in the desert! Don't just take my words. Try it out yourself!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials around 5-6 dollars, despite the irritation of using the yelp app. Quick friendly service and suggestions on the menu. Everyone enjoyed their lunch, and we will be back! I had Kung Pao beef and it was good, despite having up tell Yelp I don't want to review their app (again), just to get into the app. This place was good; Yelp app not so much."}
{"text":"I really hoped the reviews were right about the food at Max, but I didn't enjoy mine, at all! I love chicken chop suey and egg drop soup, sadly, neither was impressive. The egg drop soup had no thickness to it, contained about six strands of egg whites and tasted nothing like egg drop soup--I can't even describe the flavor. The chop suey was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. It was cooked fresh but was lacking in flavor and the sauce was more brown, than the white I am used to.  All in all, it was very disappointing. I'm sticking to Yao and J & K for Chinese--so much better. I did like that they were very nice people, I only wish my experience had been better."}
{"text":"Sorry,  I've eaten Chinese all over country.  To be fair I'm going to write this review based on Chinese I've eaten in Arizona..  Not good!   The hot and sour soup is sweet and spicy soup.   The Mongolian Beef 
was greasy.  I dine out,  order in,  or pick up because I don't feel like cooking.  I hate to say this I could have made something out of a box more tasty and A LOT cheaper.   I'll never eat Max's again."}
{"text":"Came here because they left a flyer on our front door, that is not usually a tactic that impresses me, but after reviewing the menu I was intrigued. When we walked in we were the only customers there which can be a bad sign but it is their \"grand opening\" time so we decided to stay. Owner/chef very politely offered us a table, we sat, we enjoyed, we will come again. Started with crab puffs (light, crispy, delicious), then on to the salted fish & chicken fried rice (simple but yummy), and even though they have an extensive menu we special ordered noodles (tasty and perfectly spicy). We were impressed with the nice service & wish them great success!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food. You won't regret it, just try it."}
{"text":"Adore the family that owns it. I love the cashew chicken and the crab puffs are amazing. Give this place a shot and I am sure you will keep their number saved in your contacts !"}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time ( Mongolian beef)
I love the food. The lady is very nice. And the prices are very competitive.
Very diverse menu. One day I hope to try the different things"}
{"text":"This place has good Wonton Soups, period. Get the Hong Kong style wonton soups, it is delicious! The beef brisket noodle soups is also very good too. And you can order both in your noodle soups. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever, and I'm so glad they decided to mail out menus.  I've been keeping that bright yellow menu on the kitchen island to remind me to go check this place out.  Finally yesterday, I made it.

I arrived around 11:30 and had the place all to myself for awhile.  The woman who took my order at the counter was very gracious and answered my questions about the spice level of a couple of the dishes.  I decided to order the po po platter ($7.99) which has 2 pieces of each coconut shrimp, potstickers, crab puff, spring roll, and fried wonton.  Some of my favorite fried things and they were all delicious.  Lightly fried and not greasy at all.  I ate half and brought the rest home.

They do have some lunch specials that are $5.95 and $6.95, but I opted for the Cantonese chow mein, house special with shrimp, chicken, and beef. ($9.50)  When she brought this dish to the table it was piping hot and the steam off of it smelled fantastic.  I sat there with my hot tea and just drank it in.  Perfect comfort food for a gloomy, rainy day.  As I dug in I enjoyed how tender the meats were and the mild, rich brown sauce.  I also really liked the edge of crispy noodles and that they were soft underneath.  It was a great lunch all around.  Another couple came in and he commented on how good what I was eating looked and smelled.  

I brought 2/3rds of it home and my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers last night.  I look forward to a return visit and trying more items on their menu.  No complaints.  It was a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"This is our go to place!  The wings are amazing, fried rice and noodles are tasty as they come.  But you just can't be the service you get from a family owned biz.  If you order takeout go pick it up yourself because the wait can be over an hour.  They have combo plates that will more than fill you up.  Don't let the location scare you off from trying this place - you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from Max Asia several times now and have never been disappointed. Some other reviewers have complained about delivery times but we have never waited longer than they said it would be. Plus, I like knowing that my food is made to order so I'm willing to wait a few extra minutes for that. We have never had stale food that has obviously been sitting in a pan all day. Our food always comes hot, fresh, and we have never had missing or wrong items. 

I am personally less of a fan of their more Americanized items (though those aren't bad, just what you'd typically expect from any Chinese take-out place). Their more authentic dishes are definitely on point. 

My favorites from here are the pepper calamari, wonton wor soup, indonesian curry noodles and the indonesian fried rice. I'm always tempted to branch out and try their duck or egg foo young but my current go-to's are so freaking good that I hate to mess with a good thing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are fans of this restaurant. We often order lunch combo with sesame chicken, white rice, veggies, egg rolls, and egg drop soup. Fantastic food and service. Everything is tasty and hot, all served with a smile.
Tip: For faster service, call the restaurant before you arrive. If you want takeout, you can order the food beforehand online or by phone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place we order delivery all the time.   The service is always fast and the food is always great.   The Thai-tea is really good too.  I am glad they moved in so close to me.  Going to have to visit the restaurant sometime."}
{"text":"Come Check out this place :)  Very decent food if you if you are looking for HK/asian style food.  I thik they are like Asian Cafe in mesa but with less asian variety for the moment.  They have the typical HK cafe kind of food, like wonton noodles, beef chow fun, duck lo mien, rice plates.  They also have the very typical dishes you can order in restaurants here like peking pork chop, walnut shrimp, singapore fried mei fun, various kinds of hot pot.  They also do some pretty interesting dishes, U can usually see those on their daily boards or special boards in addition to their menu.  Most of the dish ordering items are good for sharing.  if you are in a smaller group, definitely do their rice plates, or noodle soup or fried noodle items for individual

I have also tried their lunch special of mapo tofu, its americanized, but since its lunch special, thats understandable, still it was tasty and a decent size lunch portion for the price.  No complains there.  I don't judge a dish based on its cooking style, if its a good american chinese dish, it is a good american chinese dish.  Of course if you use the asian taste for mapo tofu, its gonna look like an utter fail due to the fried tofu and slightly sweet chilli sauce, but they are two different thing okay.

Do come here to try their unique dishes like chao chow duck and garlic shrimp.  I will get some chow fun and lo mein to go one evening and see if they do a good job with those ;)"}
{"text":"We decided to give it a go last night. I am so glad we did. This place looks like a hole in the wall but the food is amazing. I dare to say this place is the best Asian place in chandler. We ordered the Happy Family, Max Sweet Chili Chicken, House Fried Rice and Chicken Lettuce Wraps to go. We got out of there for $39. That's right, $39. First the service. It was nice to go to an Asian restaurant where they are happy to take your order. She greeted us with a smile and was very pleasant. We happen to get a glimpse into the back and the guy cooking our meal looked at us with a smile too. Our server said it would take about fifteen minutes and the fifteen minute wait was worth it. The food was cooked fresh AND to order. EVERYTHING was amazing. The flavors were simple yet complex (don't ask. I can't explain it). You must order the Max Sweet Chili Chicken. Can you believe they actually use chicken breast? We couldn't either. The breading was just enough but the sweet chili coating is addicting. We couldn't stop eating it.The brown sauce in the Happy Family is really good. The House Fried Rice is unbelievable. The shrimp were huge and large pieces of chicken and pork wouldn't stop coming. This is not a dish overwhelmed with rice peas and carrots.. You can't go wrong with this one. The lettuce wraps had so much chicken that the leftovers kept multiplying in front of us. Next day, the flavors intensified and was even better.They gave us so much food that we could have made several meals.
We've driven past this place for several years on our way to Panda Express, Pei Wei, Beijing and Golden Chef. Max's blows them all to kingdom come. The food was so good and fresh, we're eating her today. Yes...we're ordering Sunday dinner from here. Stop wasting time reading my post and go get some of Max's food."}
{"text":"This was a very nice surprise. I usually don't have much faith in chinese delivery, but my husband really wanted it. I got the Thai chilli shrimp and he got the orange chicken. They made the shrimp and broccoli without sauce for my four year old son (which he gobbled down). I didn't care for the fried rice that came with my combo, but the rest of it was delicious. If you're a spicy food fan you might want to get out your sriracha, as the spice level is a bit tame. 
     It was also delivered quicker than we expected and everyone was very friendly. I can be a bit awkward on the phone, but the woman who took my order was very nice and patient. The guy who brought it was also very nice.
     We will absolutely be getting delivery from these guys again."}
{"text":"Very solid food.  All the usual dishes you'd expect.  Pork fried rice was good- meat all lean, no mystery gristle."}
{"text":"Wow, I  used the recommendations  to help me decide to try this place out. The food was not good.  The quality  was very poor. The fried rice was overcooked & very greasy . The entrees  were overcooked or were pre-cooked waiting for someone  to  order it. This was  the  first & last time we will eat here.  Even our kids could tell  that the food wasn't  very good ."}
{"text":"The other day I had their Japan Udon Noodles. They truly were so good. Today I went back and tried their Crispy Walnut Shrimp. They were, by far, the VERY BEST Walnut Shrimp I have had the pleasure to have in my life! I have take out from their place at least once a week. I truly feel blessed to have this wonderful restaurant basically next door to me :)
I most certainly will stick with this restaurant, although there are other Chinese restaurants in my vicinity as well."}
{"text":"Went for pick-up because my boyfriend recommended it. I was really blown away with how great the food was that I ordered!! The salt and pepper wings are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad we returned to eat at Max Asia!  They continue to be pleasant, helpful and friendly people.  We tried a couple of dishes we knew little about. First we had \"King of the Dragon\", wonderful tender and moist breaded fish fillets, I believe Swai, in an Asian wine and garlic sauce that I requested be spicy.  The sauce was so good, with a nice kick, that I put it on our 2nd dish as well.  Satay Kway Teow, shrimp, chicken, bean sprouts, onions, egg, flat rice noodles, in curry sauce.  I'm not crazy about the curry flavor in general so the other sauce helped a lot!  If you love curry, this is a fab dish!  All of the ingredients tasted fresh, well cooked and seasoned.  Even though I didn't care for the curry flavor (my mistake not looking at the menu description) I feel they deserve a 5 star rating.  We will return many times, it's that GOOD."}
{"text":"Oh the lady that took my order over the phone was super nice!!  This place must be awesome....

It pains me to give a bad review considering the customer service and delivery speed were both superb.  The food, on the other hand, was terrible.

We ordered crab puffs, chicken fried rice, and general tsos spicy chicken on fried rice.  

The general tsos chicken was not spicy at all - despite the fact that I asked for extra spicy.  The chicken was soggy and bland -- clearly it had been sitting around and not fresh.  Instead of fried rice, I received white rice (sadly this was the best part of the meal).  The veggies were also soggy and clearly not fresh.  

My wife had the chicken fried rice and very rarely does she give a negative review, but even she said it was her least favorite yet.  I noticed she had to put extra soy sauce on to enjoy it.  

The crab puffs did not have enough filling, but had a nice crisp to it.  This item felt a bit overpriced for the amount of filling you get.  The sweet and sour was satisfactory though.

Overall this is your typical, hole-in-a-wall, low quality, cheap Chinese food that most people allow to pass as decent Chinese food.  The only reason I did not give a one star review is because they had excellent customer service, the prices are lower than most Chinese joints, and they delivered quickly - though that's likely because the food is not fresh.

My search for great Chinese food in AZ continues... SIGH"}
{"text":"I've been in this area a few months and I couldn't find any good Chinese food until I found this place. The food was great!(I had the Mongolian beef) and the lady behind the counter was very nice. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese we've found since moving to the valley!!! Duck fried rice very different and full of flavor! Hong Kong style Beef Brisket also very Good!!!"}
{"text":"Grate service made me feel like a respected costumer. I will hilly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Satay Kway Teow which wasn't terrible but it was bland. I used the salt and pepper with some soy sauce to give it some flavor. My boyfriend got the Thai Spicy Shrimp soup and I did not like it. The flavor was confusing and it just didn't taste good. However the owner was super nice and attentive so I feel bad for leaving a bad review.. Maybe it was just what we ordered? But I was not satisfied with our dinner and it was a waste of our money."}
{"text":"Nice people that work there. Kitchen seemed very clean. Food was pretty good but portion for price paid was way way off. Food did seem a bit oily also. I kinda halfheartedly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you live near by it is a great place to grab a quick meal. They have the standard Asian food, but also have duck( whole). The food is good. The people that work there are very nice. Inside is small with a few tables. It's more of a carry out place."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place 2 weeks ago, and have eaten here 5 times since!
This is the best Chinese food in ALL of Arizona. 
Family owned, purely authentic and every dish is made with love and passion for food.
If I could give it 7 stars, I would. I have eaten at the top restaurants in 2 countries and this little place is an absolute gem. 
Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - great find! This place just opened about half a year ago (according to the waitress) and it's definitely a pleasant surprise. I ordered the braised beef soup (I love brothy soup) and it had the hearty flavor of a beef stew but it wasn't thick and it was a bit spicy. Awesome combination. It was a *tad* on the salty side but it didn't deter me from eating the whole thing. Also ordered the cashew chicken - chicken was cooked well with a garlicky sauce.  This did not rock my world as much as the beef soup - definitely great Asian comfort food. 

Note - it's located in a shopping plaza that is not what you would consider posh. And the sign out front says \"Chinese Food\" - looks like a regular hole in the wall Chinese joint but it's got some colorful art in the restaurant. One other thing I have to mention is that it's VERY clean. It's nice to see them meticulously clean the tables and seats after each patron instead of just wiping it with a wet cloth haphazardly. The wait staff was also very friendly. You can tell they really care."}
{"text":"Sunday after work, looking for some good and delicious Chinese food... WOOOOOWWWW, We definitely found IT!
Service was super fast, people is really nice and the food is amazing. We got the beef stew and tendon noodle soup, beef fry pan noodles and szechuan chicken, everything super tasty and delicious.
We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the general tso chicken. It came with a cream cheese wonton and an egg roll. The egg roll was better than most places, but that was this meal's only saving grace, if any. The chicken and sauce tasted like it had wayyyy too much salt in it. As in, all I tasted was salt. It almost made me cringe. The cream cheese wonton had no flavor inside either. Will not be back."}
{"text":"They deliver! Was home on a Saturday afternoon and was looking for something local that could deliver and found this place. We ordered the spicy orange chicken, crab puffs and Hong Kong style curry beef brisket. We were quoted 30 min for delivery, they showed up in 20. The chicken was very tasty was all white meat with no weird chewy pieces. The curry beef was amazing, very good flavor with fresh veggies. The crab puffs were of course great, it's kind of hard to mess up deep fried cream cheese stuffed awesomeness. 

We will definitely be back try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"I really appreciate being able to find authentic flavors for Chinese food when in Chandler. I found this place based on Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed!  The place is not fancy- but it is bright, cheery, and clean and DEFINITELY locally owned. Gotta love that!
The owner was very friendly and personable. I told her I drank a lot of water and she promptly left me a whole pitcher to replenish myself- which of course makes me very happy!
Now to the food- the menu has a good selection between American Chinese and authentic Chinese food. They also have a special Hong Kong menu which I think I will try when I'm in the area. 
I ordered the Hong Kong style beef brisket curry and I was not disappointed!  Just the right creaminess with a hint of cocunut milk- with huge chunks of beef brisket. Portion size plenty for two people to share. It was down right delicious. 
I wish there were more people eating with me so I could have ordered more dishes to share and sample. 
If you live in the area and you're Asian or love authentic Asian food, this is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Crab Puffs, Duck Fried Rice, Singapore Style Noodles and Walnut Shrimp. All of the dishes were pretty flavorful and delicious. The Singapore Noodles really hit a note with me as it had that great \"wok\" flavor and were the drier style stir fry. My wife really like the Duck Fried Rice as well. Overall, great place for food and the only reason why I dinged the place one star is because the prices were a bit higher than expected."}
{"text":"Anytime I am near Max Asia, I either stop in or order to go, even if I'm stuck on 2 entrees - the beef tomato noodle soup or house special tofu. Having lived in SF and Honolulu, really good Cantonese food is such a rare find in Chandler. My friend from Chicago was delighted with the egg foo young - said it was on ONLY place in AZ that she has found that makes it the way she she likes (I don't eat egg foo young....) My husband loves the s/s pork and when he can get away from that, he orders the Treasure of the Sea. Family owned and operated, great find in Chandler."}
{"text":"Wow!  We found this place on Yelp when another nearby restaurant was closed.  We will be back for sure.  We had the crab puffs, the Indonesian fried rice and the braised beef in curry.  Everything was excellent.  The braised beef in curry was incredibly tender and tasty."}
{"text":"Returned to MaxAsia to try the brisket curry.What a wonderful dish.The wife had the pad thai which also was very tasty,along with the salty/spicy wings.My wife inquired about a tofu dish and the chef(Ivan)whipped some up to try at no cost.This place  is the go-to for asian food with bold flavors.Luv it."}
{"text":"Ok for takeout. One of the only delivery places in the area so that is a plus. Have ordered there several times so I think I can wife a true review. The orange chicken is good but chicken is usually dry. Ship with broccoli is ok but ship is iffy. All and all a good take out place but not the best I've tired."}
{"text":"Great food and very cheap.   I did take-out and had house fried rice, Mongolian beef and orange chicken. All were excellent, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was quite disappointed.

I ordered the orange chicken and orange beef. The chicken was soft and not really fired well. The beef was ok. The Orange sauce was the biggest disappointment. Bland, way too sweet and not remotely spicy.

I have seen people complain about delivery times, but they delivered within the time they said they would and the service was fine.

Overall, Subpar."}
{"text":"First time in. The person with me had the orange chicken. He thought it was very good. The spice was just right. I had a daily special of fish and eggplant. It was excellent. Our wait person (I suspect a owner) Ning was very attentive, friendly and respectful. We will be back again."}
{"text":"My first experience had me less than thrilled... I am not a fan of the egg fried rice. Also, the garlic shrimp I had been looking forward to looked nothing like the picture. Well, another night I had a craving for takeout and my husband suggested we try them again. I'm so glad we did! My teriyaki chicken, rice, and miso soup were very good. I like that they use thighs for the teriyaki chicken, but some may not... My husband said it tasted weird lol. I actually liked his order of sesame chicken more. The miso soup was delicious and will be remembered next time I'm under the weather. 

It's a small, family owned place so don't expect a huge restaurant. However, it's quiet, cozy, and they also have takeout or delivery ($2) if you're not feeling the environment."}
{"text":"First time here. I can't believe it took me 2 year to find there is a great noodle soup house 3 miles away from where I live. Obviously, they don't need to advertise. The seem to have 70+ reviews on Yelp at 4.5 rating. 

Order the tomato beef noodle soup and Wonton noodle soup off the Chinese menu, they are very delicious. It's very traditional Hong Kong foods. There English menu looks too Americanize though."}
{"text":"I've got to help keep the trend of these awesome reviews going! We decided to go here for lunch with the recommendation of a friend plus the Yelp reviews and we're glad we did.

The atmosphere was lovely. It's a small place with bright orange walls and colorful lanterns. It was clean too. The staff was friendly and very willing to answer questions about the dishes.

The food was very good!  We shared some orange chicken and Cantonese fried noodles with bbq pork. We also had two pork egg rolls. Our only complaint was the egg rolls. We were expecting hearty egg rolls with lots of pork. What we got was very tiny egg rolls and that didn't seem to have any pork in them at all. Its possible they accidentally gave us spring rolls. They were still tasty though.

Even though we live all the way in Maricopa (ugh...) we'll still make sure we come back. It'll probably become our go-to place for some Asian dishes."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 2 stars because unfortunately, I have had worse Chinese food. Granted, it was in WY where the Asian population is -26. 
Upon arriving to pick up my order I asked for chili sauce and the lady told me that it doesn't come with my order and I'd need to change my order to get some. Being that I was already famished from the day I decided against arguing and just paid for my food and left. My order got worse from there. The egg roll is basically a fried lump of mushy cabbage and the sweet and sour sauce nearly glowed in the dark! 
I had the shrimp lo mein which was 95% udon noodles and a few shrimp. My husband got the Mongolian beef which was extremely fatty was only half bad as the flavor was only half evident, it seemed almost watered down. Sure would have been better with some chili sauce!"}
{"text":"To me the food was bland... The \"spicy\" orange chicken couldn't even be labelled zesty & the fried rice was mealy... I like that it's close to my house, but it still isn't great. I'm looking for some bomb ass chinese food that's within a reasonable distance of my house (Chandler/Gilbert border) and this place just didn't take the cake."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night since the I didn't feel like cooking or leaving the house. The meal was okay but I'm not really sure I'll order from them again. 

Kids got Chichen Lo Mein noodles. Likely the best dish of all of them. It had flavor and veg that all looked really good. Kids ate it right up. We got some house fried rice which was pretty standard. Tasted good and wasn't too greasy. Hubs got sweet and sour pork. I'm not really a fan but he said it was okay, not great. I got General Tso's and it was bland. Not even sorta spicy and had almost no sauce on it, which might have played in to the lack of flavor. Also got orange chicken just to try. This had more sauce but was also pretty flavorless. Just not at all what I was expecting. 

Highlights of the meal were the crab puffs and egg rolls. Both of these were excellent and they were kind enough to include a cup of hot mustard which, considering how good the egg rolls were, I could kiss them for. 

Really, it wasn't a bad meal. I'm just looking for the place that is my go to. The one that I'd strong arm my husband to order from. I'm still looking for that place."}
{"text":"If I could add more stars I would!!!
Had the Curry Beef, house special Lo Ming, string bean beef, pad Thai noodles, cashew nut chicken, and the famous Hong Kong Burrito!!!

The Best! 
This is my new Chinese restaurant ."}
{"text":"They have no idea what they doing.   I order the highly recommended item duck fry rice.    When I get there to pick up.   They give me the pho special.   Claim the menu change since this is new owner.   What the hell. How do u take my order on the item u don't actually do.   How in the world a Chinese menu become a Vietnamese item."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for my first time trying this place and the whole experience was just perfect. Woman on the phone was so polite, helpful, and patient, I received my order in 25 minutes, even better customer service in person, and the food was absolutely delightful. I ordered sesame chicken, crab puffs, and some soup which I can't remember the name but was also amazing! I definitely recommend and plan on eating here more often."}
{"text":"Tried Max Asia Café for the first time this week. Dang it was good. The orange beef had just the right amount of spice, and everyone agreed we would order from here again. 
The delivery was timely and food perfectly fresh and hot when it arrived."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant a couple days ago, and it was just amazing!

First of all, the waitress was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Orange Chicken as well as the Walnut Shrimp. Both dishes came very fresh and hot. The Orange Chicken suprised me; it was very crispy and not soggy like most other Chinese restaurants. The Walnut Shrimp is one of the bestsellers, and on the first bite, I could tell I will be ordering this again. 

Overall, the service as well as the food was truly amazing, and it's nice to know that we now have a delicious Chinese restaurant in Phoenix, and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very, very happy to offer this review and to help encourage others to visit Max Asia Cafe. Our family was looking for a quick lunch option after church on Sunday and relied on the other Yelp reviews to give this spot a chance. We were certainly not disappointed! 

Inside, it's clean, brightly-colored, and nicely decorated. It's not huge, but there was more seating capacity than I had expected (for it's location in a strip mall storefront). Our family of six pulled a couple of small tables together, and it worked great. 

The owner (Shirley?) was prompt and friendly, and very attentive throughout our entire visit. Granted, we were one of only 2 or 3 customers there at the time, so maybe we benefitted from that ... but the attention we received was one of the highlights for us! 

We actually ordered 5 entrees and shared among our family (2 adults and 4 daughters). The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and the presentation was excellent. Each dish was hot and clearly benefitted from fresh ingredients (esp. the vegetables) and was skillfully prepared (veggies not over- or undercooked, seasoned well, etc.). And the portions were very ample - though I don't think we left anything behind between all of us (a combination of us being really hungry and the food being just that good!). 

Our family prefers a vegan diet when possible, but we'll flex to vegetarian as necessary. When we explained this to Shirley, she immediately helped us identify some of the dishes she'd recommend and also suggested ways to customize the dish to meet our dietary preferences and personal likes. I loved that she didn't just confirmed that we liked tofu, but also asked how we'd like it prepared (deep-fried, sauteed, soft, etc.) to fit each dish. Knowing that we would be bypassing any meat product, she proceeded to seek out our likes/dislikes in terms of other vegetables (onions, mushrooms, squash, etc.) ... even suggesting an off-menu vegetable dish that she said was a personal favorite of her family/staff (\"yu choy\"). 

We liked every dish put before us, and really didn't leave with a critical note among any of them. If I can recall correctly, we ordered the following entrees: Lo Mein ... Fried Rice ... Pad Thai ... Veggie/Tofu Medley ... and Yu Choy w/Garlic Sauce. The lo mein was excellent, and probably the favorite of the kids. My wife and I really loved the veggies/tofu and the yu choy ... esp the sauce on the medley. Our least favorite was the fried rice, but not because it wasn't good ... the others were just so much better. (To be fair to the fried rice, it was excellent - VERY fresh and loaded with vegetables.) 

Shirley was helpful in pointing out that the cafe was not a simple \"Chinese\" restaurant, but truly an ASIAN cafe, offering a variety of Asian cuisine. Our meal supported that claim. 

Pricing was very reasonable (especially in light of portion size). We'll definitely be back (always a good sign when no kid complained and most asked the next day if we could go back again!). We'll probably try their home-delivery sometime too -- will be interesting to see how the experience translates into delivery. 

All in all, an EXCELLENT choice and highly recommended. Give it a try ... you'll be back, and you'll be sharing your new find with your friends!!"}
{"text":"Got take out once.  Owner was very friendly.  I think they have way to many options on their menu, it kind of tries to encompass all of Asia..!  What i had was tasty, however the Thai food was a bit bland.  I will go back to ask the owners what they recommend.."}
{"text":"After stepping through the doorway, I knew right away that this restaurant was legit. The space was clean and bright. Reception was warm. Of course, it helps to be reassured that the 12 reviews prior to mine were 5 stars too. On my maiden voyage to Max Asia Cafe, I tried the Hong Kong Style WonTon Noodles Soup.

Based on my first meal, the food was, well, fresh. The Napa cabbage was sweet and tender. Broth was tasty. Wontons were plump with perfectly cooked shrimp and well seasoned pork. Noodles were perfect as well. Not soggy, not undercooked... Just right.

Not sure if I was being rude, but I admittedly tipped my soup bowl to empty its contents into my gullet as quickly as possible. I did, however, check if I was unashamedly committing a faux pas with Ivan, the owner and chef, who so kindly stopped by my table to ask how my lunch was.

I am definitely going to be a regular here. It's hard to resist with fresh ingredients and attentive service on Ivan's side. For my next visit, I'll be sure to taste the Braised Beef Noodles Soup at Ivan's recommendation... maybe for dinner. Spectacular!"}
{"text":"They took an hour and a half to deliver my take out. The chicken was dry and I just was overall not happy. I called to ask where my food was they said sorry but should've comped something. Also I orders a small order of crab wontons they gave me the larger and charged me for the larger. Not happy food was poor quality and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Asian fusion place in the most unassuming shopping plaza.  I only found it because my husband meant to go to Bosa donuts and it's right behind it.
The lady owner is from Hong Kong and we chatted for a bit.  She was very pleasant, and chatted with my kids, something I love because it makes them feel important to decide what they want to eat on their own.
I've been to this place 3 or 4 times now and I've enjoyed the food every time."}
