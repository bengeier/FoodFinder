{"text":"Just ate here for the first time tonight and it was excellent! I used to live in Hawaii and have eaten my fair share of plate lunch. The Grass Shack knows what they're doing. I got a combo plate of ono chicken and kalua pork and my girlfriend got chicken long rice. Both were outstanding. I'm very picky about my mac salad and they make it right. Lilikoi ice tea was legit too. We will be frequenting this restaurant now that we know about it. The owners are extremely friendly and showed us plenty of aloha. Best Hawaiian food in the area. Eat here for ono grinds, brah!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I did not know about this joint for the 6 years I've been in the valley. Cute shack, tucked away in the corner of a tiny complex. A wonderful, accommodating couple runs this place. I had the chicken thigh with ono sauce(frickin awesome) and the salmon. About 15 mins time for prep and You can easily make out the meat was freshly grilled with delightful sides. I preordered the 'Hawaiian 5.0' for next week (it requires preordering apparently) which only piques my curiosity and anticipation for the final product. 
The hosts are a delightful couple. The wiser one is a Hawaii native and the fantastic chef. The hubby is a wonderful host who delectably describes the goodness awaiting you. 

This is a hidden gem in the valley. 
This joint could use more exposure and I will do my part to help the cause."}
{"text":"The GF and I decided to trek over this evening for some Hawaiian food and we were not let down! Delicious to the last bite. I'm a little sad that my potato salad disappeared so quickly, but hey, what can you do?"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fruit teas, friendly and efficient service, and colorful decor. The proprietors put their hearts into the restaurant and their customers. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We ordered Ono beef, teriyaki beef, chicken teriyaki and loco moco. Very yummy food & friendly people!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my GF here today. Ordered a #3 (Teriyaki Chicken, Rice, Mac Salad), and extra scoop of Rice & Mac Salad & a passion ice tea. The total was only around $13. Instead of bring us the dish w/ and extra plate, they split it for us and gave us each our own dish. The food is great! Teriyaki Chicken has great flavor, not too sweet. Not dry. Nice and juicy. Mac salad is delicious, as well as the passion ice tea we washed it down with."}
{"text":"So delicious! A hidden gem tucked away! Cheap, big portions, vegetarian options (great veggie burger!) and the passionfruit tea is amazing. Try the ono sauce. Very good service, great cheesecake, a must-eat."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the ENTIRE valley!!! Paul and Lani are amazing and the prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"As a part of my exploration of the food of southern Oregon, I had dinner at the Grass Shack. Super friendly people, and a delicious meal! I had the ribs, which were reasonably priced, cooked to perfection, and so tasty. I'm sure other things here are good too, but I can't imagine why anyone would order anything besides the ribs. The potato salad and coleslaw were both also excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something a little different for our half way lunch stop on a road trip from Portland to the Central Valley in CA. The place was tucked in a corner of a shopping center right off the hwy and had both inside and a comfortable outside patio eating area. The owners were super friendly and we were even treated to samples of the teriyaki and Ono sauces and pineapple and passion fruit teas before ordering. The came and talked with us a few times as we ate and we traded travel stories. Very enjoyable meal. The Ono ribs were delicious, the meat fell off the bone. My husband had the kalua pork, it was awesome and he cleaned his plate! Traditional sides of steamed white rice, potato and macaroni salad make you feel like you were having lunch in the islands. Make sure to order the passion fruit tea, it's so good! A hidden Hawaiian gem in Oregon and worth the stop."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my son and I drove back in the Shoppes at 24 Plaza to find this place! We've seen the signs, but hadn't ever tried it. The food was so good. I had beef and chicken combo plate with Ono sauce. My 16 year old had the kaluha pork and beef plate with teriyaki sauce (which the owner gave us samples of when we first arrived). Very friendly service and great atmosphere. I was in Hawaii exactly two years ago and was so happy to hear the music playing in the background. I can't wait to bring the rest of the family."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  It is well worth the effort to find it.  It is tucked into the corner of a shopping mall and once you are are there you will be so glad!  I had the #3, grilled chicken with ono sauce.  You have to try the ono sauce.  Also the macaroni salad is a must.  I have always been ambivalent about macaroni salad but theirs is incredible.  It's a very casual atmosphere and on a nice day you can sit outside in the courtyard.  Go!  You'll be making this one of your favorite spots for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love eating at the Grass shack! The food is good and the family owned vibe makes me feel like I'm over to a friends house for dinner. I live in california and make sure I stop at the grass shack every time I pass through Oregon!  The specialty drinks are great too! Thank you guys for always making me smile."}
{"text":"Salad was a wonderful and yummy surprise. High quality meat. Tasty sauce. The potato salad was particularly good."}
{"text":"So I'll give it 3 stars because the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable.   By far the best Hawaiian food in southern Oregon.  Not that there isn't much to choose from to begin with but buttom line the food is delicious and never disappointing.  

Now I'm not giving this place 5 stars because quite frankly, I find Paul the guy who works the counter to be very unprofessional, pushy, and moody most of the time I come here.  Many occasions we felt like we were creating a problem for him for choosing to come eat lunch at his establishment.  I understand running a restaurant can be stressful but when you're practically empty most of the time this type of attitude isn't going to help bring in additional business.  

Other times he has made snide comments or tried to make us feel bad when we couldn't finish our food.  He should just stay in the back and do the cooking and have Lani take care of the customers.  She is very nice and always polite.  Or better yet hire additional people to assist with the cooking and serving guests...  I wanted to give this place 5 stars but being unprofessional to guests is not good for business.  For this reason I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Owners know many of their customers because they're regulars. That says a lot to me. It's a little hilariously Hawaiian, bit that's part of the charm. Owner was way nicer than a typical restarsuant. Very friendly. She just about earned five stars before I even ate a bite.

Had the ono chicken with pineapple tea. It came with rice, macaroni salad, and potato salad. It was very filling and quite tasty. Chicken was grilled, glazed with ono sauce (something a little like teriyaki but a tad spicier), and very moist.

In all, if this was near where I lived (way off in Austin Texas), this would be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Love this little place.. Compared to other Hawaiian places in the valley this is by far the best place to go for quality food. Prices are very good but portion sizes are smaller than some of your typical Hawaiian plate lunches. The wait staff is always very pleasant and are right there if you need something. Dining outside in the summer time is my favorite. Tiki torches light up the back Patio while you enjoy your dinner. Live music is always playing on the weekends and is a great touch to the little place. They also offer multiple house made teas that are all very good. A nice selection of homemade sauces is always nice to top off your tasty meals. Very highly recommended and will continue to support them over other Hawaiian places in town. I hope there location does not hurt them in the long run. I wish they were closer to town and not in an abandoned strip mall..."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the EJP (Evil Jungle Prince) - coconut curry at its best. The service is good and the owners are very friendly.

They have live music on Saturday."}
{"text":"They cannot supplant or replace or outshine Noho's.... but they can rule the S. Oregon galaxy together w/Noho's.... you know, like Darth invited son Luke to do, at the end of \"Empire\". There is room and ravenous appetites enough in Jackson/Josephine county for binary stars to offer us their incandescence in an endless Romanesque food orgy into perpetuity--- Mahalo to the stars and Lord Vader as well.

While the hosts/owners/operators of da' Shack warned us of their huge portions, I did not find the ensuing challenge insurmountable. I don't know if they offer Bla-Lah portions like Noho's, and can't believe I didn't think to ask. But the meats were prepared so expertly, marinated w/perfection and not too sweetly, then grilled to tender, lightly crispy edged perfection. The chicken, steak, and terriyaki beef all were standouts; the Kalua pig alone was off, being a little too dry, inconspicuously. I loved the house made hot sauces, esp w/the oil and chili flakes.

How bout this? Guess who's got Chicken Long Rice on their menu--- uh, Grass Shack, that's who, as opposed to just about 100% of the rest of the competition in the PNW. To be sure, Chicken Long Rice isn't make or break territory, but I personally enjoy it, and would order it over other more conventional saimin-type soups at other Hawaiian places, nearly every time.

I was similarly delighted to see Loco Mocos and spam musubi offered at da' Shack--- although they ask that you phone in any requests for musubi, several hours in advance.  And the friiggin burger patties on the Loco Mocos--- huge! Juicy! Ono!!! I would have liked to have seen more gravy on my Moco, but the rice beneath the patties was pleasantly saturated w/gravified moisture. Dang me for forgettin' to ask for extra grilled onions!

We were delighted to be given extra fruit salads w/our meals---complete w/the glorious coconut pudding, oh my goodness, that brought back many a fine memory of luaus past.  Again, this is a small detail but one often overlooked by Hawaiian places on the continent.

Grass shack has been doin' the day-yum thang in Phoenix for over 5  years and they say they were surpirsed by the relative high percentage of islanders in the area. 

All told our whole group loved Grass Shack and look forward to fussying amongst ourselves for years to come, deciding between Noho's and da Shack. Either way it's a win for us!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!!!!!
The food, the atmosphere, the owners!
We are taking all our friends and family to share this Unique place.
We have had several Birthday Dinners there and the owners Loni and Paul make sure everyone has an incredible time and absolutely awesome food!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I have ever had! Get the #4 with extra mac salad and you wont be disappointed. A little bit of spice but not too much. Also really good pineapple iced tea."}
{"text":"My first Hawaiian restaurant so take that into consideration.  The atmosphere of this place is comforting and the owners are nice and seem eager to please.  I didn't find the prices unreasonable for the quality of the food and both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our meals.  They also have some interesting desserts and drinks (especially teas) if that's what your in the mood for and I also personally enjoyed their homemade sauces."}
{"text":"maybe i don't know what authentic hawaiian food is... the choices were: chicken/rice or pork/rice.  not much selection, but it tasted decent. big portions"}
{"text":"Shopping in Medford on the way back to Ashland.  Found this calm lunch cafe with Hawaiian decor and Hawaiian food.  Wonderful friendly people, tasty food, easy access from I-5.  Large servings of chicken ono for me and teriyaki chicken for my husband with tasty potato salad.  A pleasant interlude in great contrast to the usual fast food lunch choices."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my son, Josh.  It is similar to No Ho's in Medford as it serves the same Hawaiian cuisine.  The menu is not as extensive and the service was ok, the prices were a bit high for the quality of food although the food was tasty.  There is an outdoor dining patio which is nice on a sunny day.  There is ample parking, easy to find right off of Exit 24."}
{"text":"I used to live in Kauai, the food is so Hawaiian authentic. Great prices, great service. My favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great variety, and extremely friendly owners.  Best shop in this mall by far. It's tucked way back in the corner."}
{"text":"First let me say I am hesitant to ever leave a negative review, and also that I didn't even try the food.  I walked in the side door and made my way up to the counter, as I assumed you order there.  No one was there so I was looking at pictures on the wall when a man came out of the back and said \"are you ready to order\"?  I said not quite and was going to ask him a question about side orders when he cut me off and said \"why don't you ring that bell when you are as I have a lot of food on the stove\" and disappeared into the back.

Now, I know we all have bad days, but I consider this to be just flat rude.  I turned around and left, and will likely never go back.  Here is a tip Mr owner, hire some help!  This was my first time here, and I was going to give them my money based on some really good reviews.

Again, the food may be great, but my experience was completely negative. I hope future Yelpers prove this to be an anomaly!"}
{"text":"Went here with high hopes, but it was closed on a day/time when it should have been open. No note, just closed."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! I had the pot stickers.  Very fresh and yummy. The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is nice and clean. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say, customer service is Really Good! We didn't know what to expect. We walked in with a referral from a fellow yelper *thanks to Holy foo'*

We walked in with an open mind. We stood around for a bit *crickets here*, found a wall with a hanging folder filled with menus and instructions on how to proceed (cool). We had plenty of time to review the menu (no pressure what so ever) and stood at the cashier counter for a few minutes (not a bad thing). 

There is a cashier/server in training. I think it is AWESOME that they take the time to PROPERLY train an employee (I.e. down to EVEN the smallest of details, 5-STARS HERE)!!! We were given samples of their in house specialty teas: pineapple, passion fruit and lemon grass ginger. All of the teas were Delicious! I opted for the lemon grass ginger because I've never found anything like it! More please *smiles*

Killian (employee in training), you cooked a PERFECT MEAL! Everything was made to order and the food was served at the ideal temperature. This meal EXCEEDED our expectations *high five* 

In Summary:
*Filling Portions for the price
*Good Quality (made to order)
*EXCELLENT Customer Service

*The house made \"Ono sauce\" combined with a squirt of sriacha sauce is a HEAVENLY combination for Everything - OMG MORE!!!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have found this little hidden gem just south of Medford.  It is tucked away in a little strip mall but  don't let that deter you.
The owners are very helpful and genuine but it is the food that will bring you back! A perfect Hawaiian plate is what I received!  I would have to say the Kailua pork is up there with the best I have ever had!  Of course it is served with 2 scoops of sticky rice and macaroni salad, both equally good.  I must say we enjoyed everything we tried, teriyaki chicken, beef and short ribs.
Don't forget dessert even if you have to take it to go!  The first night we tried the ice creams and we're impressed with the deep fruit flavors. The next night we tried the coconut cake!  I am writing this review because of this cake, well and the pork too!  A beautiful round moist cake covered in a wonderful coconut cream covered in coconut.  It is like a delicious coconut snowball in the summer!
Next time we are in the area we will be back!  Thank you for the delicious meals! Mahalo"}
{"text":"This was a very satisfying meal! My chicken was so moist and flavorful.. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The stickiness of the rice was on-point and the potato salad is the first I've eaten that I've actually liked! Owner presence and friendliness took my experience to a whole new level! I will most certainly be coming back again :-)"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I am changing my rating to five stars because this has become one of our favorite places to eat in the rogue valley. Please don't expect this restaurant to run like some kind of commercial chain restaurant. Things run on Hawaii time here - sit back, relax and enjoy a delicious passion fruit iced tea and some conversation with the owners. They run this place in a home-like environment. Everything is fresh made. The Kalua Pork has become our favorite dish and the potato salad and macaroni salad are the best we've ever eaten. I wouldn't change a thing about this place.

Tried three dishes: the Ono Chicken, the Kalua Pork and the \"Evil Jungle Prince\" which is a peanut curry dish. The first two were really fabulous - Kalua pork cooked to perfection and tender, Ono Chicken sauce is very \"umami\" - delicious. The peanut curry dish was very nicely made with big chunks of fresh carrots, potatoes and pea pods, but just a little bland for my taste (this dish is a special and not always available). The passion fruit iced tea was awesome. I love that they have a self-serve \"sauce bar\" for all of their sauces in case you need extra for your meal. The proprietors are so friendly and are Hawaiian so they know what they are doing. I'm glad to have found another restaurant in Phoenix we can frequent when we don't feel like cooking. :-)"}
{"text":"In a wasteland of bland, mediocre food, I definitely appreciate that the Grass Shack exists. That it sits just two doors down from a place that sells balut -- even better. Completely awesome that in Phoenix, Oregon of all places, there's a little bit of that Pacific Islander flavor.

The decor of the place is total Hawaiian-kitsch -- bamboo wall coverings, palm trees, Don Ho playing on the flat screen -- you get the picture. And the food -- pretty much what you'd expect. Teriyaki chicken, Korean-style shortribs, loco moco, macaroni salad, and so forth.

The only thing that kills me is their pricing. I know this is southern Oregon, and not LA, but dude, $9 for a plate with just two pieces of chicken and two scoops of rice? Pricy! Even NoHo's floats better pricing than that. A meal for two, including drinks, will run you easily north of $20. And for what's essentially an upgraded quick-service restaurant? Ouch.

It is delicious, though. So come on down if the price is right."}
{"text":"Super yummy authentic Hawaiian food made by authentic Hawaiians! The couple that owns this place are SO sweet. The wife seems to have a great recollection of faces and loves children (they both do!) And the hubby is kind and knowledgeable. 
The atmosphere is wonderful. Calm but not too quiet, just not rowdy or anything. 
everything we have had here has been absolutely tummy stuffing delicious! We will definitely be coming back for more (and more)!

Try their homemade pineapple or passion fruit teas. They're divine."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night on our way home to Portland from Spring Break with a group of 10.  The place was not super busy, but the food was amazing and we got to watch the Ducks play basketball.  I would come back."}
{"text":"We went in tonight for the first time. We were very pleased with the quality the food was very good. Reminded us of our favorite place on Maui. We had their Combination pork and chicken thighs the macaroni salad was great we also tried the pork pot stickers & yummy dipping sauce, I loved the sauce on my rice. We will definitely be back. Excited for finding this special place. The service there was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever! Please try this place you will love it. Local owners too who remember you. Great prices too"}
{"text":"I never get tired of coming here.  It's a small corner restaurant in a shopping center just off I-5 at the Talent exit.  But man they can make some ono grinds!  The kalua pork is just perfect.  Love the macaroni salad too.  That's kind of the only thing I order when I go there.  I'm probably missing something awesome off the menu but kalua pork is my favorite."}
{"text":"I don't like sweet sauces on my entree and for that deducted one star. The Yakisoba noodles were well cooked and the thin slices of beef good, but the sauce was very sweet and a little strange in taste. Although the owners are from Hawaii, the food they serve is \"Mainland\" style Hawaiian food - think \"Chicken Bento\" style. And few dishes have vegetables. Mostly they serve teriyaki soaked meat with macaroni and rice. The food at Medford's Sunrise Cafe is far better and more Hawaii nei."}
{"text":"Both the service and food were excellent. I love that the place is cozy just like a shack and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Not only do we always get a delicious meal here, we are treated with that warm Hawaiian hospitality every single time we come. We love the owners as they always make us feel special."}
{"text":"Wow! We pulled up and the place was empty, though I'm not sure why. You order your food up front And they bring it to you. The owner was super sweet and the food was amazing!!  We will definitely we going back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food best Island food we have had after moving to Oregon from San Diego CA. It's about a hour from where we live but will be back."}
{"text":"Flat out rudest customer service and worst food ever! I should have stayed shallow in the parking lot and just experience the same old McDonald's at least then I know what to expect! 
After reading all the reviews I actually feel sorry for the people that have been duped into thinking this is true Hawaiian food coming from a Hawaiian descent and having been raised on authentic real Hawaiian Pacific Foods this stuff is complete flat-out garbage over onioned, too much mayonnaise and cabbage to hide the lack of a true serving! My first and only experience there they were out of many dishes which I find comment and inexcusable the man at the counter was rude and short with us and after tasting the food realized they are catering to people that don't know the difference between real and canned and garbage. I'm actually offended that this place called themselves Hawaiian and sells this sort of stuff to people.  There is nothing authentic about this food or this place it's a mockery of the tradition and the culture with all of its plastic Kitschki decore. It's an insult and one of the grossest places I've ever experienced I will never go back!! If I could give a negative star review I would I'm only given one so that this is seen and read!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! The food here is incredible!  Decided to eat here simply because they have an outdoor seating area that's pet friendly and was rewarded with an amazing experience! The staff was super friendly and everyone in my party was VERY satisfied with their meals! After listening to the table next to us rant I may have to try the ribs next time but I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The ribs are amazing and so is the potato salad!  We kind of stumbled upon this place and it was empty which made me nervous but we gave it a shot. So glad we did! We split two entrées. We got the ribs,  and chicken and pork. The chicken and pork were ok but the ribs were spectacular!  The passion fruit tea was excellent as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Of the three other \"Hawaiian\" places around that I have tried their food, this one is the BEST.  Yeah, I said it.  One place in CP overcooks everything, One place on McAndrews adds way too much salt and chili flakes, and that place on Main, (even though food is good) isn't open very much during the day, (Although Sue will hook me up with a huge container of Kimchi anytime I ask.  Even at 5, so 5 stars for that!)  

I ordered teriyaki beef, and received two slabs of ribeye on my plate!  Sweet!  The mac salad tastes authentic enough to take me back to my childhood on the Island.  

I think my favorite part was the Lilikoi.  So unexpectedly refreshing and good.  Will recommend this place to anyone, anytime."}
{"text":"I tried to have lunch here today. I ordered and gave the guy my credit card. He said 'we don't take Amex'. I said oh, ok, I'll write you a check -- it is a local check. No, he said 'I won't take that'. We take cash... how much do you have? I counted out my cash and I was 3 dollars short. He yelled into the kitchen 'cancel the salad!'. I said oh well, I guess I can't eat here today. He said 'that's right'. I paid 2 dollars for my iced tea and left. Ugh. So, I'd like to have tried the food, but didn't get a chance. This review is to recommend anyone who wants to eat there, bring cash or MC / Visa. I'm thinking he could have recommended something for which I had enough cash, but that's just me."}
{"text":"This place is in the same shopping center as McDonald's... For the same price you can get pretty damn good teriyaki or ono chicken (that has been charred a little) with two scoops of rice and a scoop of creamy Mac salad, instead of burger \"value\" meal # off the drive thru window at the other place it sits near... 

They also have a nice patio area, which was nice to soak up some sun while we were waiting... You might call in your order if you're in a lunch time hurry, because it can take a few minutes... But definitely worth it...

***Eat Local***"}
{"text":"If it's Hawaiian food you want, this is the place to go.  There are other decent places, but this is the winner.

The menu is a little unusual, in that there are multiple ones, and some additional specials that are posted on the walls.  So - there is no one place to look for their full menu.  There is a lot of variety for this style of food.

The Ono sauce is amazing, and I'd recommend that if it's a choice.  They'll let you sample a taste if you want to try it, but I say just go for it.  Everything I hope and expect for Hawaiian food is delivered here.  My father is a retired chef from Hawaii, and I know he would approve.

It is true that this is a very small family run operation, so you'll have the occasional day when they are slammed and service is impacted.  If you're in a rush, you might think about coming on a different day.  But, do come.  It's worth it.

I don't like the janky Phoenix highway offramp exchange to get here, but that's not the restaurant's fault.  Just be careful, if you're not familiar with the area."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the drive to Portland for a snack but ended up eating in the courtyard. Lovely spot to hang out with the dogs. Delicious homemade teriyaki sauce and juices/fruit iced teas. I wish this adorable spot was near our house in CA!"}
{"text":"Great food and great conversation! Very nice owners and the meal was amazing I'll be coming back again and again whenever I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food is awesome I get the #10  Kalua pulled pork with the homemade macaroni salad that is to die for. Dont get me started on the ono sauce, amazing! I'm on my 5th visit. Owners are always the ones behind the counter and you can tell alot of love goes into this place.

-Destiny"}
{"text":"Not personable at all. My husband has certain dietary needs and when we asked if something could be modified we were told \"this is how it's made, if you don't like it you can go somewhere else\" way to make people want to come back"}
{"text":"Amazing food everything homemade (obviously except the sirracha sauce). My teriyaki beef only costs $6 for happy hour, and the portion and quality is superb! Very friendly host too, a must check in spot"}
{"text":"So good. Had the Ono chicken with 2 scoops rice, mac salad. My husband is half Hawaiian & he liked it. The passion fruit ice tea was recommended & was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a special treat for my crew.  Heard lots of great things about it and I was not disappointed.  The dining are service areas were clean and well kept, the atmosphere was very calm and relaxing with indoor and outdoor dining.  The service was outstanding, I had given them very short notice for a 12 part order and they had it ready for me in as much time as it took to get there, says something since I called at 1pm lunchtime.  The order was complete and excellent, my entire crew loved everything.  Yakisoba, Short Ribs, Kahlua Pork, Teriyaki and even the guys who got the steak burgers said they were some of the best burgers they had had.  There are some excellent homemade infused iced teas to choose from as well and some delectable desserts.

Will definitely visit again.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  Has the pulled pork and Ono chicken...absolutely the best!  This was my first time here, in my wife's recommendation, and it definitely won't be my last.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. Happened to come on Sunday night and they were offering a buffet for $12.00 a piece. 
I normally NEVER do buffets but this was awesome. I felt like I was at my family picnic knowing all the food was made today- it was  so fresh and flavorful!! The owners were very attentive - knowing too we had never been before, they were so helpful.
The Kahlua pork was just melt in your mouth perfection - he said it was just out of the oven- it was like I was home eating my own roast that had slow cooked for four hours. 
They had desserts that were served after everyone got their fill of potato salad and macaroni salad- again this was like the best family potluck dinner from all your favorite aunts and grandma's recipes.
They then had live music. Folk style music- the gentleman said he comes every year and plays - supports several causes. Is personal friends with the owners. 
We will come again. The restaurant is in the very back corner of the complex- you should try it."}
{"text":"My roommate and I needed to find a place to stop and rest while on our road trip to california. Our ultimate goal was to avoid stopping at a fast food restaurant. 

This place is a family owned business that was really friendly. We were greeted by a lady and ordered our pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream and loco moco. I think for a family owned business, this was pretty good. The portions were decent. In my opinion I still thought they were big. But, if you truly have the \"American\" standards of big, then these portions might be small for you. They even had an outdoor patio for you to sit out and enjoy. This place was a partial self-service place. They deliver you your dishes on a plate and you bus your own table.

From reading all the signs in the restaurant, it seems like they try to make it friendly and have entertainment for you. If you're trying to avoid the typical fast food restaurant during your road trip to California, stop by at this restaurant. It definitely beats the grease and all those mexican restaurants along I-5.

The one thing i questioned when paying was \"50 cents to split plates.\" Really?!

There is ample parking, all the way in the back of a mellow shopping center."}
{"text":"Pleasant Family atmosphere.  Family-run operation, yet surprisingly efficient.  Fairly priced, very fresh.  We had five entirely different meals, yet they came out together, hot, in a reasonable period of time.  The meet was tender, the soup was hot, the veggies were fresh and crispy.

A definite go again for us.  We all had dinner for under 45 bucks."}
{"text":"do not come here ever!! seriously the worst service, and from the owners, no less. 

my 8 year old autistic son is super picky, so we asked if we could bring in his chicken nuggets since we were a party of 5 who were going to order food at this establishment.

the place was absolutely empty and it was cold and windy outside, so we asked nicely if our son could eat inside with us. the man at the counter was about to let us since the place was dead slow, but the woman went on a long diatribe about how if they make an exception for us, then they would have to do it for everyone... and that mcdonalds wouldn't want us to bring hawaiian food there either. 

we walked out. i was shocked at how these owners were lacking in compassion and discriminatory to a little boy with a disability... when it's a cold and windy day! 

i wish i could give them negative stars. thanks for ruining our family lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian place in the Rogue Valley.  The Ono Thigh Plate is my go-to item but other choices like the Evil Jungle Prince, burgers and more never disappoint. The owners are always friendly and welcoming. Worth driving to Phoenix!!"}

{"text":"This place has a family feel like I'm in my mom's kitchen. Love the ambiance. Love the kalua pork plate and chicken plate with ono sauce.  One of The best kalua pork I've ever had.  I love how they have toys for kids in the corner to keep them distracted as well."}

From the food, to the ambiance, to the attention to detail, it is worth pulling off the highway to eat here!

It is tucked away in a plaza with many other businesses, but even from the outside you can see it's decorated with grass like you'd see in a hula skirt lining the windows.  (Hence, \"Grass Shack,\" I suppose!)

We were the only patrons there the entire time, but we arrived fairly early on after it opened.  We were greeted immediately by a man behind the counter, who seemed to be the owner.  He oriented us to the menus, and before we could even order, he was offering up samples of their sauces (I'm typically partial to teriyaki sauce, but their ono sauce lived up to its name) and their pineapple iced tea.  (They were out of the passionfruit iced tea.)  I have never, ever seen my husband order iced tea before today, but after the sample, even he couldn't resist!  It was presented nicely with some mint garnish.  It was refreshing and perfect.

I ordered the kahlua pork, and my husband ordered the chicken, and we each ordered a little mac salad and a little potato salad, which contained pieces of bacon.  I love kahlua pork, but frequently can't eat much of it because it tends to get a little salty.  Had I had room in my stomach for the generous portion here, I would have happily eaten the whole plate.  It stayed juicy and perfectly flavored, and perfectly soaked up both the teriyaki and ono sauce, as well as some yellow (I think pineapple) sauce that came with it.  The potato and mac salads were very well done and perfectly portioned.  This may sound a little odd, but the rice was even excellent!  I had two scoops of it, and they were both warm and a little mushy in the middle, which I liked :)

The service also struck a perfect balance of friendliness with \"I'll-leave-you-alone-you're-eating.\"  I don't know that we will be going to Southern Oregon all that often, so I wish Grass Shack was here in the Willamette Valley!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner and it was amazing! The service was great BUT the food was a wonderful delicious surprise. It was the best Hawaiian food ever!  Excellent! Fresh, tasty and we left with macaroni salad and their special sauce to go for tomorrow. Can't recommend this hidden jewel enough. Will be back in two weeks.

{"text":"Have had takeout from here several times. Food is fresh and delicious. We love the teriyaki chicken and beef. The rib plate is amazing - fall apart in you mouth good. Potato salad is delicious as well. Great place for kids as it has a little area with toys and books that they can rummage through."}
{"text":"I love this place, great people serving good food. This is a hiding gem in the shopping center and is really the best Hawaiian food around."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hawaiian food so while on vacation we were pretty excited when found this spot. The food was amazing, had the rib plate, mixed chicken plate, pineapple tea, passion fruit tea & mango pineapple cheesecake. Loved them all and service was great, very kind & helpful. Wish we lived closer would make this a regular."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad to say about this place! I'm not sure about the couple posts that talk about bad customer service because when we walked in, the first thing the owner asked was if we had been in before. Since we hadn't, he gave us two small cups with both sauces they use; one Ono and one teriyaki. We tasted both and both were delicious. My husband and I both got the chicken and beef plate. Ono on the chicken, teriyaki on the beef. We opted for half macaroni salad, half potato salad and the white rice. When it came out, we could tell it was prepared to order. The chicken was moist and the beef was nice and tender. By far, my favorite Hawaiian place to eat!

Oh and don't pass up the POG juice!!! So refreshing and light! Great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and decided to look for some good lunch places, we were excited to find a Hawaiian place so close to our house. It was really good, decently priced, and we left absolutely stuffed. Totally beats out the Hawaiian food we're used to, can't wait to come back and try other dishes. 

I'm going to have to disagree with other reviewers about the prices & portions. All of our plates were under $10 and we left stuffed.

Have to edit my review from 5 to 4 stars. Food is still good but the owners were arguing in the back both times I've been here. I guess we'll stick to takeout rather than eating in."}
{"text":"I'm really glad this little gem is somewhat hidden or they would be packed and have a line.   I just moved to Medford a couple months ago, and have realized, Medford food is not good.   I had yet to find a place I love until tonight.  From the people working being happy and clearly loving what they do, to the awesome authentic food.  I had some ono chicken which was flavorful, juicy and generous for 8.50?! Comes with rice and a side. That's less expensive than fast food and it only took 10 minutes from when I ordered.  Huge plate so I'm happy to have left overs for tomorrow!  They also make homemade ice cream (lots of flavors if they arnt sold out) and Hawaiian deserts, to die for.   Kinda hard to find the place, and only open 4 days a week but a real happy surprise.  I will be here at least once a week FOREVER lol"}
