{"text":"It was pretty dead when we arrived 8:30ish for dinner on a Saturday, but things seemed be starting to liven up when we left, with a several-member band coming to plan some Buena Vista Social club-esque music.  The atmosphere is nice, and the service was very good. The menu is nothing spectacular (some pasta dishes, burger/wraps, standard appetizers) but the food we got was good and well-priced. There also were some good deals on booze: 5 coronas for $21, 5 mill street organic for $15, and decent prices on pints (mill street, tankhouse, amsterdam on tap, if I recall correctly)."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to in Toronto. Even if you paid me, I'd never go there again. Stay away! It started out when they would not take a reservation. We arrived at 7pm and we were only seated at 8:30pm. The hostess was rude and obnoxious. She even made us wait outside. The service was very slow and not courteous. The food took for ever and it was cold. Never go here, unless you want a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Restaurant looked interesting so we went in and asked for a table. We were told half an hour by the hostess so we waited. Half an hour in she said maybe another hour without so much as an apology. I recommend the owners to replace her, the hostess is the first impression that any patron will experience and she does nothing but a disservice to the establishment.   As we left, another table was leaving and we overheard them grumbling too."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place on an impromptu taco night suggestion and I was pleasantly surprised. We just had tacos between us. You can get one for $3 or 3 of one for $15. We ended up order six different types and the kitchen prepared them one at a time which was welcomed as we thoroughly enjoyed sharing them one at a time.   Definitely recommend. Be careful and keep the napkin handy as some of the tacos (especially the hard tacos) are runny and will require extra care. Hmmmm so juicy  also, this is mexican food. the next door restaurant is Noco which is the italian and seem to be confused by the first reviewer of this restaurant."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO BOMB.  i came here with my bf yesterday and the server and bartender were exceptional. food was great, recommended by the server. the chicken chipotle taco was to die forrrrrrr. my bf liked the red sangria a lot as well (he always orders red sangria everywhere we go, so for him to actually like it here says a lot). my bf fell in love with the beef x chorizo x cactus taco. food was out real quick. the bartender was super friendly and so was the server. we will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first when the waitress sat us at the very back of the empty restaurant, but things very quickly turned around when our waiter came by. A very funny and down to earth guy, he gave us the low-down on the menu. We had chips and guac to start, 5 different types of salsa. Tried a bunch of tacos, each one was better than the last. The shrimp el diablo taco was to die for! Chicken poblano was really good too. Was very happy with everything. A perfect spot for a fun dinner with a couple friends. I'll have to come back and try not to eat so many tacos so I can save room for desert"}
{"text":"Tacos where amazing the drinks were horrible and insanely expensive I'd go back for the food in a second but pass on the drinks."}
{"text":"So good! Guac to start, tacos for mains and the flan for dessert. Do yourself a favour and try the flan!! Service was fast and friendly. Would recommend without a doubt!"}
