{"text":"Hands down my favorite caf√©. Wonderful atmosphere and warm service. I really love the piano instrumentals they play throughout the day. For a student like myself it's the perfect place to sit down, relax, and study. Usually I spend quite a few hours in their care and have never been asked to leave. There are more elderly patrons but I have noticed that most are well acquainted with the family running this restaurant. I have even seen an old man speak his thanks in Korean. This place soothes my soul and I definitely recommend bringing someone for some meaningful conversation."}
{"text":"What sets Cafe Hesed apart from other cafes is the atmosphere. A collection of comfy, fancy chairs, nice architecture, and jazzy music makes my lunch visits a pleasure. (A great escape from work and reviving my spirit as well as my empty tummy.)

I recommend the cranberry turkey panini or the BLTO (classic BLT with Onions added!)

Good for groups, but keep in mind there's one long table and the rest are small, round tables with two chairs. (Groups *do* come here, though, and just use the small tables pushed close together.)

The family that runs Hesed is super friendly and nice. Good quality food, too!!"}
{"text":"Run by a Korean lady and I guess thats why they have Korean dishes on the menu. Only came here for a cold drink so this review is not based on the food which I'm sure is excellent based on other reviews. Got an ice cap and a green matcha ice cap. Both were great and perfect on a hot summers day. Nothing really dtood out for the drinks though. On par with places like Tim Hortons and Starbucks.

Inside is open and there is a good amount of seating. If only I had room to eat their food here I would have definately given it a try. Lots of Korean fusion dishes available."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and relax. You should try the bibimbap...it's really good. 

It would be nice if they were open on Sunday, but guessing it's a Jesus thing. 

Only criticism really is their wifi password commemorates the surrender of Japan at the end of ww2.  Not a really big deal but it was over 70 years ago."}
{"text":"Been back to Cafe Hesed many times since the original review and I'm upgrading it to 5 stars. It is the best place in town to get a latte and have a cafe experience -- look out the window onto Main Street, bring your laptop and work, read the newspaper.
The staff are so nice and friendly and that counts for a lot!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe. There's an upper level with comfy upholstered arm chairs where I sat. It's such a chill place. Some of the food items on the menu were korean but I didn't get to try it today. I just had a lunch combo of sandwich & soup for under $8 wow. Great service, wonderful place, really friendly people. I love the cozy atmosphere and couldn't get enough of the quaintness of Newmarket. Can't wait to come back and snuggle into my seat again."}
