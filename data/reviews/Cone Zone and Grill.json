{"text":"Cone zone is america! They are why supporting the local guy makes so much sense.they are local and their ice cream is the best.drop the mic.go there"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people think this place is over priced? But anyhow... super cute neighborhood ice cream joint. And the hot dogs are amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"So sad that the community can't support this fantastic family business year round. Can't wait until they reopen in the spring!"}
{"text":"I love the old fashioned feel of this place, reminds me of my childhood. My fianc√© and I got a sundae with German chocolate, black raspberry, and coconut flavor with a Pepsi. Can you say yum!? The girls working the front were also very friendly."}
{"text":"This is not just another soft serve ice cream.  Tastiest in town!  Plain chocolate is my favorite, but Cone Zone can offer you I think like 88 flavors, and if you complete the punch card for all the flavors, you get a hoodie.    It's those kind of friendly and fun offers that make Cone Zone a place you want to come back.    The atmosphere is friendly and the owner takes great pride in providing the best products.  They make their own waffle cones and the mozzarella sticks and fried mushrooms are the best!  You can't beat the specials that are offered.  A great place to stop for a bite to eat along with that soft serve sundae you know you want!!  Someone said it earlier, it's a Mom & Pop kind of place that makes everyone feel welcomed.  Is it worth going out of your way?  You bet.  There is a lot to do around Kamms and Rocky River Reservation - including heading on over to Cone Zone & Grille.    P.S. - Cone Zone season ends mid-October, so check back in spring!  it's on my calendar."}
{"text":"Cone zone has the best milkshake.  It a fast good place. But u have to wait a lit not cause the food is made right when u order it."}
{"text":"Great ice cream , hotdog ECT... Very nice, employees ,  clean, affordable ... one of our favorite spots to treat ourselves and kids ."}
{"text":"I love you Cone Zone! The staff here is very friendly and quick. The few food items I had off the menu were real good, the price is right and those large milkshake/malts! Be careful, that's 32o.z. of the best chocolate malt I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Outstanding business.  Reasonable prices, good food, and very friendly and courteous employees.  I've been going here since they opened a few years ago."}
{"text":"Classic ice cream place with some great food specials.  Old school feel and great group of adults and kids serving good stuff.  Worth a visit for some good treats."}
{"text":"I wish they were open right now. I know they have a ridiculous amount of soft serve flavors, but I would just order vanilla and chocolate swirl and it would be delicious and I would eat it while pretending it's 1987. I like this place and I hope it reopens!"}
{"text":"I've now been to Cone Zone twice. The first time probably would have gotten 3 stars. After a repeat visit with a better food experience, I'm bumping it up to 4 stars.   On my first visit, I popped in for lunch because I was craving a good thin, greasy drive-in type burger. I ordered just a plain single cheeseburger with fries and a drink.  There were a couple of nice mom-types who were cute and both very eager to help me with my order and suggest other things I might want. I Dream of Jeannie was playing on the TV in the corner. I got a good chuckle out of the whole scene.   Based on just this visit, food was definitely 2 stars. VERY overcooked/straight-up burnt burger and fries just meh. However, I was intrigued by the menu and just the sheer variety of choices so I decided to come back.   The second time, Sean and I stopped back in and I decided to give the burger another shot. After all, nobody's in business very long if the burnt burger is the rule and not the exception. Indeed, the burger was much better this time. The meat isn't wonderful but for 3 bucks, what do you expect? Sean got one of the specialty dogs for himself and then we got another of the dogs to split.   The hot dogs are where it's at people. The specialty dogs 'Juicy Scandal' and 'Tasty Treason' are awesome. The chili is just meaty and beany enough and not super runny so it doesn't get everywhere. These were really really good.   Sean also tried some birthday cake ice cream thing which he said was good, but so far we haven't tried many of the other ice cream options (TONS of them). We'll definitely keep coming back to try more. Highly recommend you stop by and get one of the hot dog specialties. So tasty!"}
{"text":"What would summer be in the Kamms Corner/ Westpark Station area without a walk to the greatest little ice cream shop. Nothing fancy just great cones and sundaes  all with over 25 flavors of soft serve too choose from."}
{"text":"Walking into the Cone Zone is like walking into a time machine back to the 80's.  For me, this is a good thing.  It's basically your classic Mom and Pop Ice Cream stand/Grill joint, Soft serve, shakes and sundaes, Hamburgers, Hotdogs, fries etc.   The Cone Zone was clean, the service was friendly, and the food and prices were A-OK by me.  Anything earth shattering?  No, but comforting and satisfying?  Absolutely.    One interesting twist on the soft serve (no pun intended) is that the Cone Zone has a few dozen different flavor options that can be added to your standard vanilla cone.  I don't know how they do it, I imagine it involves blending in some kind of flavored syrup, but my banana flavored chocolate dipped cone was as delicious as I hoped it would be.   I don't know that I would recommend anyone drive across town for a visit, but if you are in the Kamm's Corner area and want a decent lunch or a sweet treat it's definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Cone Zone?  Great food (be it ice cream or hot food) and great service.  This is always a summer must for our family.    They offer daily specials like 2 Hotdogs for $3.00 on Tuesdays and Fancy Sundaes for $4.00 on Sundays.  My favorite thing about this place is they offer like 30 different flavors of ice cream.  My got to is a Black Raspberry Milkshake.  Give it a try next time you go, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I walked out of 7-11 last night and saw the Cone Zone \"Open\" sign glowing. My friend's 3 year old has been talking up Cone Zone for quite some time now. He was absolutely right. This is a great family owned ice cream and grill zone. The value is outstanding. The large milkshakes are 32 oz. That is a lot for $4."}
{"text":"This place is your typical neighborhood ice cream stop. I thought it could use a makeover. Think it would be more successful if they invested a little time & money in the business, perhaps extended their hours too."}
{"text":"Decent prices, excellent for the little ones, or adults under the influence of whatever tickles your pickle. I'm lactose intolerant, so I go with the chicken strips. All you need is a four piece to put you right where you need to be.   They're open quite late, 11 O'clock. Pretty late for a small ice cream shop. I'm glad though. My buddy just moved down the street from this place, he takes his little gut all the time. He used to live in stones throw of Dina's, not a fan. He definitely upgraded here. 7/11 and Cone Zone, best combo definitely a 2-for.   Their huge I think 32oz shake is fairly cheap 3-4$ (see menu for exact prices), they have a ton of flavors and varieties to choose from including:   Malts, Smoothie, Slushy, Dips, Novelties Ice Cream Sandwiches, Silly Bars, Drumsticks, Fudge Nutty, Ice Cream Quarts, Pop, Bottles Water, and Red Bull  Tons of flavors for whatever your choice:   Sundae Flavors Chocolate, Hot Fudge, Cherry, Carmel, Butterscotch, Strawberry, Pineapple, Oreo, Peanut butter, Marshmallow, Mint, Coconut, Raspberry, Blueberry, Peach, and Nutella Shake Flavors Chocolate, Vanilla, Banana Oreo, Jamoca, Plus any of Our 34 Flavors Avalanche Flavors (32 kinds) Chocolate Covered Pretzel, M&M, Butterfinger Reese Cup, Nerds, M&M, Peanut, Turtle, Oreo Cookies and Cream, Malt Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Covered Banana, Hawaiian, Twix Banana Split, Brownie, German Chocolate Reese Pieces, Kit Kat, Cookie Dough, Health, Nestles Crunch, Cheesecake, S'Mores, Snickers, Capt'n Crunch w/Berries, Coco Puffs, Pebbles, Capt'n Crunch w/Peanut Butter, Golden Grams, Rice Krispy Treat, Take Five and Birthday Cake"}
