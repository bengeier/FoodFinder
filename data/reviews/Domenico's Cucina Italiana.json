{"text":"I've been going to Domenicos since it opened.  My wife and I and usually another couple go there regularly 2-3x/month.  We keep going back because for us, Domenicos provides 2 things for us when we go out to eat, good service and good food.  I read the other reviews and I question whether we're talking about the same restaurant.  We have never had a bad meal there. Sure sometimes, even with a reservation we have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table on a busy night but so what.    All I can say is that the staff have always been kind and very courteous. Waiters like Cesar and Lucas always make us feel welcome, very similar to the waiters we encountered in Italy when we used to live there.  The kitchen turns out imaginative specials most every night in addition to a great menu.  We love the mussels and the osso bucco, some of our favorites.  Other couples we have gone there with know their way around wines and they were very complementary on the wines that were offered.   It's a great restaurant that we thoroughly enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed in the least - first, four adults we placed in the farthest corner of the restaurant, so close to the wall and next table, the two females could barely get out.  Ordered minestrone - seemed like a safe way to go - wrong!  Bland, even after adding salt and pepper - just not good.  Then ordered beet and tomato salad - 2 beets cut in half and 2 thin slices of tomato - $9 bucks!  Other patron ordered Caesar salad - really - 3 romaine whole (very small) leaves, croutons and a whole anchovy on top - if it looks like and worm and tastes like a fish - its an anchovy - why it was not incorporated into the dressing is beyond me.  Male counterparts ordered lasagna but was just ok - and next day ran into some who ate there the night before and was sick from eating the mussels.    Too many other restaurants around this area to go here again."}
{"text":"Our party of four arrived at 6:30pm with a reservation that was not honored so we spent 20 minutes at the bar where the ladies' martinis were good, but my friend's cosmopolitan was all orange liqueur.   The football game was on behind the bar so we did not mind too much.  When we got to our table we had plenty of time to order, sharing two appetizers and an entree apiece. We tried to order from the short wine list with two price tiers - $35-ish and outrageous.  The first wine was out so we asked for a pinot grigio from the Alto Adige and one came back from Friuli instead.  We finally agreed on a California chadonnay and settled back to wait for our meals.  The appetizers were fried calamari and a carpaccio salad which were both competent, if uninspired.  The ladies' main courses were the sea bass special which was served in a piquant tomato sauce of olives and capers.  The ladies both pronounced it tasty, but as they got to the center they both found it undercooked to the point of being raw.  My friend's osso bucco was also delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender.  My lasagna Emiliana tasted very authentic to me, being only ground meat, bechamel, and pasta with tomato sauce served around it not in it.  After complaining about the fish we all split a complimentary tiramisu, where you could actually taste the lady fingers and the espresso.  All in all I felt that Domenicos starts from some authentic delicious recipes, but a little chaos in the kitchen and with the wait staff detracts from the experience.  I hope they can overcome these deficiencies."}
