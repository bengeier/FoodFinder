{"text":"Went to Annaby's for the first time today on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Had the english muffin with cheese egg and bacon. Plates come with a side of fruits and julienne potatoes.  Portion was perfect, not too big not too small. Price was very reasonable too. 20$ for two breakfast plates   DOG FRIENDLY TERRACE!!  The service is great and at night it doubles as a sports bar! Decor is habs themed so that's always cool!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and 3 kids on a Saturday night. It took 15 minutes before the waiter came to our table. Our order was taken 5 minutes later. One hour later my soup was served. Then 15 minutes later our main courses arrived but they completely forgot about the hamburger my oldest daughter had ordered. It took them another 20 minutes to serve the hamburger. Food was okay. Service was absolutely lousy! They should really consider hiring waitering staff to provide a bare minimum of service! If service is important for you, don't go there!"}
{"text":"Habs themed resto-bar, nice and clean, lots of TVs to watch the game. Steak sub was pretty good, girlfriend had the club sandwich, it was huge and the chicken was really good. They have real fries and they're quite tasty, will definitely go back to try their poutines. Free refills on soft drinks. Fairly cheap for the amount of food we got."}
