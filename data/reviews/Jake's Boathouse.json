{"text":"Way out of my area, but worth a visit every now and then.  The decor is different than what I'm used to. With that said I still really like it. It has an authentic feel to it. The staff is friendly, the food arrives in a timely manner. Nothing much to complain about.  The good is nice too. Salad with a piece of blackened fish on top is great. Unlike a lot of places, Jake's isn't too cheap with the size of the fish that goes on the salad, it's pretty decent. I also tried the Vodka Penne here once. It was unexpectedly great, way better than I would have anticipated. I liked the shaved parm, it was a great touch.  If you're out in this area, and feel like a good meal, at a reasonable cost, do yourself a favor and give jake's a try!"}
{"text":"Delightful place! Enjoyed the steak! Nice selection of offerings. Supposed to be a cross between a british  pub & a steakhouse.  Doesn't manage to do either. However, the food is good & the service is excellent. Carol was our server & was very attentive & rather humorous as well. They have live music in the evenings so its probably a happening place by that hour. We went early and enjoyed the calm. Nice place. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here based on proximity to my hotel. Had a grilled chicken entr√©e that was ok. Not terrible, not great. My friend described his fish tacos the same way.   The coffee we got at the end of the meal was undrinkable. My grandpa used to make me instant coffee made with hot tap water. My dad reuses old coffee grounds. This was worse than both of those things.   That said, I'm giving three stars because other than the coffee the food was edible, and the service was really friendly and warm and I kinda liked the homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"My last visit to this Nautical themed restaurant/bar was simply for a quick pint with a good yelp friend. The nautical themed decor was surprising considering there isn't a solid body of open water for miles, but I enjoyed the sea shanty look and feel with high ceilings and modern fixtures. To be fair, from the moment you walk in, you're not sure where or what to look at!  Admittedly we were only in for a drink and while there beer selection was fairly standard they did take pride in pouring a perfect pint of Guinness (in stages, not all at once).  Location wise I felt it was a tad hidden from sight and if it hadn't of been for my GPS directing here and there I likely wouldn't have seen it driving across Queen in Brampton.   One thing I found remarkable about Jake's is that they have an amazing stage set up that overlooks most of the bar (almost above the rest), there was no band playing as it was mid-day on a Sunday, but I think this house must be a rockin' many nights that I'm unaware of.   For these reasons I start Jake's off with a 3 and look forward to upgrading them once I've had their food and checked out their nightlife!"}
{"text":"This poor place needs help and needs help bad. We should have known right when we sat down that this place was no good. It was 4 pm on a Saturday and literally other than the one guy at the bar we were the only ones in there. Red flag number one, no ones there. But whatever we thought, let's stick it out. Our waitress greeted us telling stories of how her last group left without paying the tab. Usually I'm against this but if this chap had half the issues we had I don't blame him. Red flag number two, people leaving without paying the bill. So let's cut to the chase finally we order , food drinks etc and there we wait. 20 minute until our beer arrived. Ok so now I'm thirsty and pissed off, good job I know it's difficult to focus great service on the only table in the entire place. On to the food, which shows up at the same time as the drinks, funny it takes the same time to pull a draft tab as it does to craft chicken fingers, salads and quesadillas. Well go figure because it was all absolute garbage. My chicken fingers were no better then battered tree bark. And the quesadilla came out boiled or maybe steamed. It was some new hybrid way of cooking a fricking quesadilla I never seen before but it was soggy and absolutely sucked and I didn't even eat it I was just pissed looking at it. Quick summary, avoid this place unless you like tree bark and boiled quesadillas and warm beer."}
{"text":"Have been a few times during the day to meet up with friends for lunch. Food was ok. Made the mistake once to venture there at night. It was geriatric hang out and meat market. Never again"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! Friendly staff and good food.  This is the kind of place you feel comfortable in.  Would have given 5 stars but the menu is a little short in options.  I would recomend it though."}
{"text":"This whole place is decorated with a \"boatful\"  of nautical gear, it seemed a little bit too gimmicky but I must admit did pique my interests. But I was still a little skeptical if this \"Boathouse\" no where near a body of water could deliver on good seafood.  I came in here on a Saturday afternoon and only 3 or 4 other tables were occupied, they have a dining and a bar area, I settled for the bar area since it was more conducive for a table for one. Looking at their menu however I was surprised at how little seafood was featured in it, in fact I was shocked that out of all that, only 3 items fell under \"fish\", but they do have mussels. Most of the menu is taken up for steak, ribs and burgers. One would think that their fish would be \"world famous\" as opposed to their ribs. I do hate it when restaurants add annoying and completely false statements about their menu, I would be very surprised if someone did fall for the fact that the ribs at Jake's Boathouse are indeed \"World Famous\".  I came in here hoping for seafood so I went with their fish taco (pictured) and I was actually very surprised when I saw that it actually looked like a good piece of fish in a taco shell and it was very tasty too. So now I wonder if their fish was this good why do they have so little options for seafood and does this mean that their burgers or ribs would also surprise me in being good? Only repeat visits can tell, and I'm sure I will be doing that.  Service was quick and my server was very friendly (seeing as how empty it was I would have been very surprised if it wasn't), however my beer came freezing cold and very flat, I'm going to attribute that to being either the first or last pint of the keg?   While I am still surprised at the fact that this place seems to be all about seafood on the outside only to deliver the shock of predominately featuring meat based meals on a menu design that screams seafood I can't deny the fact that my specific meal was well done and I had a good experience here, this was definitely going towards a 2 star review in my head before I saw my food.   They also seem to be prominently feature live music nights and I can definitely see this place be a popular spot for people to gather for music as they have a small corner in the dining area for bands. So I can imagine the vibe being very different in the evenings here compared to the quiet lunch I had."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was great, I had fish and chips hubby had wings. Another couple who joined us had the salmon said it was very refreshing. We went at about 8pm by 9 it was packed the live band was amazing. Definitely would go again. The crowd is a little older but a ton of fun."}
{"text":"Good basic stuff. Nothing fancy but solid food and greAt beer selection. Grilled fish tacos and clam chowder... Really good."}
{"text":"The worst bar I've ever been too, felt out of place, they wouldn't tell us if we could order food or not maybe because we were not older than 30 but we're in our 20's and if you are our age you'll have a terrible time, the hostess is very rude as soon as you walk in and also when you're leaving, couldn't stay for more than ten minutes with my friends we didn't want to get drinks or stay lol"}
{"text":"The veggie wrap ($11)  was missing the feature ingredient:  portobello mushrooms. The remaining arugula, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a touch of feta was bland and boring.  The friendly waitress advised they have a new chef, so he is still learning the menu.  No discount or comp for the defective wrap.  The side curried yam soup was better fare.   I miss the old Jakes at its original location . . . Better food, better quality back in the day . . ."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try after being disappointed again with Boston Pizza.  In the future, I will definitely go here for a quick lunch or a burger when in the 410 and Steeles area.  If you're looking for a non-factory-pressed patty, this is where to come.    Came on a Thursday, about 15 tables filled of business people on lunch, a difference to the tumbleweeds that could pass unfettered through Boston pizza across the road.  As I walked in, two plates of the fish and chips went by, they looked great!  Large pieces of fish, batter looked spot on.  I sat at the table next to where they went and those who ordered it commented how good it was, and how it had a good amount of fish in it.    I ordered the Loaded Burger (chili, cheese, avocado).  Fries cooked perfectly, crispy.  Burger is handmade.  Gravy was also really good.   Service was prompt and pleasant.  Draught list offers the usual suspects, but also Guinness and Kronenbourg.  Also, and maybe more importantly, this place has a patio that doesn't immediately front onto a major road.  It's near a busy plaza and Costco traffic, but this is definitely a solid outdoor dining option.  Interior is well laid out and clean, with a nautical/pirate theme.  They offer live music as well, ladies nights with cheaper cocktails, and Caesar Saturdays.. I would come back."}
{"text":"Alright, so let's take a look at this. We had my wife's 50th here last nite. Had 70+ ppl attend. It's a excellent venue with a great party atmosphere. The band was solid with 80's-90's Rock, but for me that's where it ended.   We ordered 60+ drinks for our guests & 6 different types of Appetizers to go with em. This is the list...Chicken Bites, Bruschetta, Nachos with Cheese dip, Veggie Trays, Pizza Bites & Chicken spring rolls. The chicken bites were a big lump of fried chicken. Looked terrible. The bruschetta was very good. The pizza bites were very under cooked & blah & the spring rolls were good. What can u say about veggies...their veggies.   My main course was the Fish Tacos...in a word...terrible. My wife had chicken fingers but they were outta the box & tough to chew.   Let's look at the service....COMPLETELY UNDER STAFFED. Our group waited more then a hour to get our food. Tables were partially served (1/2 got food & 1/2 didn't) & often with incorrect orders. With all due respect to the wait staff, we had 1.5 wait staff for likely 100 ppl.   I was disappointed with many things about the event but I guess you live & learn."}
{"text":"Can I say it's hit and miss? Had a burger here once that was great so I recommended it to everyone and we all went back for burgers and this time they were horribly dry and not enjoyable. Waitress complained about how many tables she had, and not in an endearing 'sorry I'm so busy tonight!' kind of way.  The nachos here are great! I come here for work dinners and wouldn't go when I'm alone."}
{"text":"It was hard to come up with a star rating for good 'ol Jake's.  The food is good but typical pub fare. They're known for their ribs which ARE excellent but can be hit or miss in terms of consistency. One day they'll be 5 star ribs, the next they'll be 3.  For me what really elevates Jake's from a 3 star to a 4 star establishment is the staff and the management. This is not a franchise pub, this is a place where they will learn your name if you're a regular. This is a place where if your server has a big smile when they see you it's because they're having a good time at their job, (either that or they do a good job faking it).  This is also a fine venue for live music and have been known to feature some truly talented local bands. Also a great place to watch a game over a pint.  If you are going to a Kelsey's or Caisey's, or Jack Astor's, or any of the generic bar/grills in the area just know that you could be getting superior food in a superior atmosphere just down the road at Jake's Boathouse."}
{"text":"Finally got new owners and things have improved. Food is improved and so has the service.  Worth trying again!"}
{"text":"Great place to party on a Friday night. Live band and a small dance floor, good food friendly staff and lots of good people to party with"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friend's going away party on a Friday evening.  First off the decor is typical of a bar/resto.  Food was not that bad although the cream of mushroom soup came out barely warmer than room temperature and we had to send both our orders back to be reheated.  I had the peppercorn pasta and the wings and it was quite OK. I usually like my creamy pasta to be a little creamier though. (see pics)  The servers were either too busy or confused but during our main course, they came back with my soup...  Our friends who were midway through their natchos were brought another order by mistake..  The best part of the evening was when the band came on! My type of music! YES!  They played it quite well too. And the small dance floor became quite full dare I must say of cougars!  Yes gents, there were quite a number of them on this Friday night!"}
{"text":"I go to Jakes 2-3 times a month for lunch.  I've also gone for drinks and dancing in the evening.  It's one of those few places where you know you will have good service and good food every time.  Kimberley's homemade desserts are to die for."}
{"text":"Our local pub. Great for a drink on Friday or Saturday night, love the scallops with bacon, bathed in butter as an appetizer...  Bartender is best in Brampton and often has your drinks ready when you come to the bar (regulars).  Only wish list is that they put parquet down for the dance floor instead of that old carpet. DJ's would also be nice every once in a while please!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant only because we were staying at a hotel near by. We have now been there 3 times and it keeps us coming back. The fish taco were awesome great service too. There is never been a wait as it is never crowded. The restaurant is tucked in strip mall so you really don't know it's there. Glad we tried it. Will def visit on our next trip here"}
