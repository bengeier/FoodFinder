{"text":"Tonight my husband and I visited Cleveland Tiffin and we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience.  Before I get into sharing about the food, I must express how friendly and personable Anup and everyone at Tiffin were.  While waiting for our food, Anup shared fascinating information about Tiffin Carriers in India.  I will continue to learn more about this process on my own.       Now on to the dinner,  I am vegan so I ordered the Palak Paneer and traded out the paneer for tofu extra spicy.  I also ordered Vegetable Biryani extra spicy.   This was a delicious meal.  The spinach and tofu was so flavorful and fresh and the Biryani was aromatic and addictive.  My husband orders the Chicken Tika Masla.  He also enjoyed his dish as well.  The portions are large so I have a lot of food left over to eat.  All dishes are made to order...like a homemade meal.  With that in mind, prepare to order a couple of hours before you plan to eat dinner.  It is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food...!! The finest indian restaurant in the town and for the vegetarian food lovers this place is outstanding. A lot of varieties in the food and the taste is yum!! be it shahi paneer, mutter paneer or veg briyani..  Also, amazing service!! :)"}
{"text":"We try the fish and chickens curry. The rice is very special but I like it. Good experience and boss are very nice."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely not microwaved despite what one reviewer said, I talked to the owner for quite a while when I visited and everything is made fresh to order. This is a fantastic Indian restaurant at a nice price. Don't hesitate to give it a try."}
{"text":"The people here are so courteous the food is absolutely the best Indian cuisine in north east Ohio. Get ready to splurge at a down right epic restaurant. This restaurant is great for all types of people from new to Indian food to have eaten Indian food your whole life it is an outstanding restaurant #best Indian food ever"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the people here.. All the food was cooked fresh and delivered on time as promised. Absolutely loved the home made Samosas and Parathas and I don't miss home anymore.. Would definitely recommend this place.  if you're looking for home made, healthy and delicious Indian Food - this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim to have lunch because of the five star rating and were not dissapointed! The food is definitely worthy of the rating! We enjoyed the samosas, which look and taste like they make them from scratch, fresh to table, followed by the saag chicken & chicken biriyani, accompanied by the korti (I believe that was the bread, I'm used to naan, but this was a different genre of bread) which was really effective for scooping and eating your dish. We also had the sweet & mango lassis. All of it was delicious, absolutely delicious!  Added plus that they offer delivery as well as eat in/pickup options. Very friendly service too! Definitely recommend and they will be seeing us again soon!"}
{"text":"Such a unique establishment. i am not an indian cuisine connoisseur, but this restaurant is special and unique. still learning the fare and cultivating my pallet. they cater to details. the proprietor and his wife (the chef) cook every meal \"to order\". No cooking ahead ... not a fast-food approach. don't let the styrofoam plates and plastic utensils taint your tastebuds. They will cook your dish to your special requests (like spice levels). delightfully friendly and obviously interested in pleasing their clientele. patience is needed due to the cook-to-order nature, but very much worth the wait. i haven't taken advantage of their take-out (and they do deliver), but it is apparently very popular (i believe they need a days notice).  If you're in the area or close, i would suggest giving them a try."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find this gem near our new home. The food is excellent and the Samosas were the best ever."}
{"text":"I am visiting this area for work. I yelped and found out about this gem. Food is absolutely amazing. It is real authentic Punjabi Indian food. I have tried chicken tikka masala, bhindi masala, daal makhani and garbanzo beans. Everything was to the point. Food reminded me of homemade food by my mom. If you want to know what home made  fresh Indian food taste like. Please stop by Cleveland tiffin."}
{"text":"Cleveland Tiffin is awesome. It takes a while, generally almost an hour from order to pickup, but I'd wait twice as long for food this good.   Samosas are out of this world. Butter chicken, saag paneer and palak paneer (yes, they have both) are all fantastic. Malai kofta is another highlight. Spice level is consistent too...we get 4/5 (American) which probably translates to 0.5/5 (Indian) but it's got a great kick without being too spicy for us. Other places have totally inconsistent spice levels so you don't know if it will be bland or super spicy.   Friendly staff, even send you a text to say they hope you enjoyed it (hell yes I enjoyed it). You guys rock."}
{"text":"The hours listed are in accurate they have posted 1130 am went after this time and was still closed. Neighboring business said they can open as late as 1pm some days. It would be a great idea to call ahead."}
{"text":"I love their food. We ordered Aloo and Gobi Paronthe they were just amazing. Tried their samosa chat as well. The samosas were fresh, crispy and not oily at all. They also deliver! A must try if you are looking for authentic Punjabi food. Call ahead if you are dining in as the food takes a little time to cook as everything is freshly made from the scratch."}
{"text":"Yum! Food takes a little while to come out because it's truly made to order in this cozy mom-and-pop shop. We had the malai kofta and chicken curry. Both were wonderfully spiced and delicious. Also tried roti and paratha; perfect accompaniments. Will be back -- definitely to try the goat curry (Fridays only!)"}
{"text":"Are you looking for home made and authentic Indian food? if yes, you should try this place. We get our food from this on weekly basis. They offer weekly tiffins at reasonable price - take all the stress out from cooking!!!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Definitely hole in the wall, but some of the best Indian food we have had in Cleveland.  We will add this to our takeout rotation for sure"}
{"text":"Dined in on a Sunday, early evening.  While the restaurant is not much to look at with not many frills, the amazing flavors of the food and charm of the family who runs it definitely make up for anything lacking in appearance.    Give yourself a little extra time as each dish is made from scratch, which is why everything comes out piping hot and delicious.  It took about 15/20 min from time of order to service of food.   Everything is served in paper/styrofoam containers and with plastic cutlery and it seems that they perhaps do more takeout rather than dine in.  I will probably try take out in the future but i highly recommend dining in as it likely maximizes flavors and freshness since there is no need to reheat once you get your food home.    We had an order of samosas, butter chicken and aloo gobi (cauliflower and potatoes cooked in a nice spicy sauce).  The samosas come with a chutney dipping sauce and the entrees come with rice.  All were delicious.    We were served by a young man who also took our order and payment by the register.  An older gentleman (perhaps the father of the younger man) stopped over at our table for some pleasant conversation and to make sure everything was to our liking.   Overall a very nice experience and some of the better Indian food on the east side."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer and veggie pakora. All were delicious and so fresh. Flavors were bright and complex. Probably the best Indian we've ever had. The owner could not have been friendlier. Will definitely be back to try new dishes."}
{"text":"The food was microwaved Indian frozen food, the naan is the kind you get in the freezer section at Sam's club."}
{"text":"Best Indian food and friendliest service in Cleveland. Naan isn't on the menu, but they have it and it's amazing.   Food is made from scratch when you order, so prepare to be a little patient. But like all good - nay, GREAT - things, this is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the state of Ohio if you want fresh food you must try it the seasoning its incredible"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel. I was working late and couldn't go out for food. Luckily I found this place on Yelp and the delivered!  I ordered the malai kofta, samosas, paneer paratha, and a roti. All the food was good, pretty authentic and made me miss home a little less.   They were really accommodating and the food was delivered on time. I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Great eating place. Authentic Punjabi Dhaba food. So hard to find something of this sort in the US. If you are in Cleveland area.. this is one stop take out place. You can always sit there and eat.. but the ambience is not that great. That doesn't bring those 5 stars down. Just go there and enjoy the Punjabi food. You will remember your mother/home cooked food."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Cleveland Tiffin as we are fairly new to the Cleveland area.  The food was excellent and we appreciated the personable service of the owner.  Would definitely recommend and we will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food..awesome people behind the food!   I ordered shahi paneer and roti- fresh homemade food! Highly recommend this place..Wish this was in LA!"}
{"text":"Today I finally got the chance to eat here for lunch and enjoy some yummy 5 star Indian food or so I thought. I've been reading rave reviews on this place for weeks, so I decided that I would get some takeout. I ordered butter chicken, samosas, and a garlic naan. My total came up to $17.80. Ok maybe that's a little pricey to some people but I figure if the place got a 5 star rating then it's definitely worth it, right? Boy ol boy I was soooo wrong. I picked up my food drove back to work and ate my lunch at my desk. As I was eating I realized I've been duped, tricked, bamboozled and everything in between. Looking at the yelp reviews I thought it was going to be outstanding and amazing. I had outstanding Indian food and honestly this was average at best. Like don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth the money or the rave reviews at all. Next time I have a hankering for Indian food I WON'T BE BACK. I'll go to hot or mild in Mayfield Hts or Choolaah on Chagrin."}
{"text":"Like the food it was really tasty and freshly served need to work on ambience thts y i m rating it so"}
{"text":"Best butter chicken  in this town. Priced reasonable, plus this place is on delivery apps like Grubhub and UberEATS. They never disappoint"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering their weekly tiffin meals for a couple of months. They are often rotating the dishes so you are able to get a great variety. We love the home cooked taste of the dishes! Vegetarian dishes are very good! They offer home delivery which is very convenient."}
{"text":"Great service! Highly recommend if you like or even just want to try authentic Indian food. They deliver as well, which is super convenient bc where I live (Bedford) there aren't many healthy, quality food options, esp for vegetarians. I will definitely be ordering regularly."}
{"text":"We arrived after 12 hours on the road just as they were closing. They stayed open for us, and served us cheerfully to boot.  There are several places to sit inside, and though it's small, it's not crowded. Just cozy.   We ordered the paneer pakora, malai kofta, vegetable biryani, and vegetarian curry. Everything was hot, and AMAZINGLY delicious. We're from Boston, we've had a lot of excellent Indian food, and this absolutely stacked up. The kofta was honestly the best I've ever had. The balls were soft and melted in my mouth with just the right amount of spice to creamy sauce.   It's really too bad it's so far from our home, otherwise I'm sure it would be a regular stop in our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Wow. The Yelp reviews weren't lying ... This place is fantastic.  We ordered kadhai pakora, shahi paneer, aloo paratha, and vegetable samosas. I have eaten Indian food in hundreds of restaurants across the US and in other countries and this has to be THE best Northern Indian food I've had yet.   Our food took about 40 minutes to prepare (we called our order in -- you should do the same). They cooked EVERYTHING from scratch. These were not reheated sauces they had lying around. You can taste the difference. The food was rich, flavorful, and perfect in every sense.  We sat down for a few minutes and the owner came over with some vegetable pakoras for us while were waiting and chatted with us. Extremely nice guy who clearly loves what he is doing -- and it shows in the flavor and quality of  the food. WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"New favorite! I'm so glad it exists, because the food alone would make this place amazing, but the owner boosts the good feelings even more! We ordered ahead for take out (gave ourselves 40 minutes, strong recommendation if you want take out.)  Things I loved: -- THE FOOD: We ordered aloo paratha, shahi paneer, kadhi pakora, and samosas. The shahi paneer lives up to its name: Shahi means royal, and the sauce was perfect. The aloo paratha melted in the mouth. The samosas were the perfect amount of spice, without being overly greasy as samosas that sit under a heat lamp would be.  -- The preparation: The owner mentioned with pride, nothing is frozen and everything is fresh made. It's noticeable, because the sauces were like the ones my friends used to make, fresh where every bit of spice is noticeable. The samosas were not frozen then re-heated. Even the rice was just cooked!  -- The Owner! He is so friendly, and came out to sit with us when we waited 5 min for the rice to finish cooking. He brought out veg pakoras and chatted with us about how he started Tiffin, and adventures in cooking. He didn't have to bring out the pakoras (WHICH WERE AMAZING, Great ratio of potato and onions). He didn't have to sit with us and get to know us. He didn't have to tell us his stories in a kindly, fatherly manner that made us feel at home. But he did!  Things I did not love: -- Trying to find it, the store sign needs to be a little bigger, but that's no reason to take a star off! They've just opened.   -- The location is kind of weird (although conveniently off of 480!) and I can't believe someone took a star off for it."}
{"text":"First time! Wass a little pricey for the portion. Would've been nice to throw in a peace of bread maybe for the price. On to the good stuff, the owners son waited on me and was very nice. I ordered my dishes 5 on the spicy scale and he suggested to go higher next time. Well the 5 was just right for me and I'm no spicy wimp. (Were you trying to kill me guy suggesting higher?) Nah...LOL.He suggested if ya like coat to be sure to come in on Friday's. I said I liked coat but actually never had it. (I was thinking \"lamb.\") I ordered two dishes, curry chicken and butter chicken. Came with rice. Both tasty. Would definitely go back for the taste and the nice owner."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a meal along the way through Cleveland and we happened upon this little gem on Yelp. It is a little family owned restaurant that may not look like much at first but DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU!!! The food is cooked fresh to order (so be prepared for a well worth while wait) which of course means extremely fresh, hot, right off the stove/oven food. This was possibly the best Indian cuisine I've had. Definitely check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg omg. The flavor. The spice. The freshness. So good and I can't get enough. SpArse interior really makes you realize that all that love and flavor goes straight into the food. We've had take out before but finally sat in with the food coming out piping hot and we just couldn't put our plastic spoons down.   I only wish they had reusable dishes instead of styrofoam but overall a new cleveland favorite for us."}
{"text":"My husband is still saying \"incredible\" this morning after we ordered delivery last night from this authentic restaurant.  We ordered Tikka Masala (my favs d my benchmark), Paneer, Garlic Naan and Curry Fish.  All came with an abundance of jasmine rice.  The restaurant owner was very understanding when I used the yelp app to order delivery through Grubhub (first time) and it came up as a pick up order.  He delivered our order in person and even stayed to chat for a bit sharing the history of getting into the restaurant business.  Very personable and friendly.    And there my husband just said it again ..... dinner was \"outstanding\" . Give this place a try, we definetly will again. (Oops forgot to take pictures, we were too hungry!!!)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. We like the Butter chicken and the chicken Korma. Really nice family owned business."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new, and found this little gem. Fantastic food -- the best Indian I've had in a long time, can't say enough about that. The portions were quite large, had lunch for the next day to take home. But even more than the food are the people! We got to speak with the owner while waiting for our food (as it's all made fresh to order), and felt so welcomed by these kind people. They even offer a weekly meal deal for a very competitive price, if you want to take even more home!"}
{"text":"Too expensive and not even half worth it. The rating given was for the home delivery service. Food, per se', doesn't warrant a rating."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant tucked away in a small little strip.  I have passed this place hundreds of times Have even shopped at a little store not far from there.  Never even noticed it,   and when I finally did I thought it was a new restaurant.  I went in today  ordered tikki masala, Butter chicken,  and chicken vindaloo. The food was excellent!  That owner is a very, very nice and welcoming man. We had a great conversation when I picked up my order.  He takes such pride in the food that they serve, as he should!  It was wonderful!!  I love finding independent restaurants in the city and this one is a gem I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So yummy and great service. Brought me a complementary samosa while I waited for my order. Everything is prepared fresh. Will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"The Chana masala is fantastic. If you like spicy food- go for it! They served me a true 7/10 heat level. Most places don't. The tamarind chutney with the samosas is also a must have!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food with kind services. We ordered paneer and dal dishes which were so delicious. Definitely we will come back."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom after seeing the good reviews on Yelp. The place is being renovated so we had to get takeout. The owner is super friendly and seems genuinely proud of the food he serves (all made by his mom!). My mom got saag paneer and I got navratan korma. Both were excellent! We also got a sides of raita and naan. They were good too. Glad I checked Yelp. I don't think I would have ever stumbled upon this place otherwise.   How does this"}
{"text":"Food here tastes like home made food! Literally finger licking good! Authentic Indian Punjabi food. Their wheat rotis are soft and puffy just like the home made phulkas. We had the malai kofta which was creamy and flavorful.The Gulab jamun for dessert was notably good as well. Thumbs up from me for this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, delivers to home weekly if you order from their delivery menu. I've been ordering from them for over a year, and have never been unhappy"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic and spicy (if you request)! We love their food and their customer service is phenomenal! They have become a weekly staple in our household."}
{"text":"This was EXACTLY what we were looking for. Authentic and flavorful foods made fresh for each order. Probably one of the best mango lassis I have ever had! The samosas were delights in a perfectly flaky crust, pakoras were just the right size and taste. The entrees were mouthwatering! No pictures because we couldn't wait to dig in! Thank you to Anup for creating a warm and welcoming environment to dine!!! Can't wait to come back for more and introduce our friends to this food gem!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm sensitive to spicy and They made a mild Chicken Curry for me and it was so delicious and full of flavor."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Cleveland Tiffin for the first time tonight and everyone absolutely loved their dinner. Thank you so much for the excellent food, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cleveland Tiffin was a really fun experience. We were looking for a restaurant that would have a lot of vegetarian options and were very pleasantly surprised to discover an excellent Indian restaurant at a very accessible location on Warrensville Road, near 480.  The prices are very reasonable. We ordered a samosa, chana masala and malai kofta. Everything was very good. They will adjust spice however you'd like and next time I would request to take the spice down a notch on my order of Kofta.   They do only begin preparing the food when you order it, so I'd suggest making sure you allow enough time. It's not a place that would be a good fit if you are in a hurry.   Also - while we chose to dine in, I think it would be an excellent place to carry-out from in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Cleveland Tiffin today. Not only did I meet the owner and his lovely family but the food itself, speaks volumes. We need more Cleveland tiffins around the Cleveland area. This is place is for those with busy lives, students away from home, or for catering, or for those who want to know what real North Indian home cooked food tastes like; No added creams, no preservatives, not pre-made and frozen, or heavy butter. Just real fresh home cooked Indian food. I ordered enough food to last me a few days, two vegetable dishes , and one chicken dish. The way it was made, made me feel as if my mom was right in the back making the food just for me. Brought tears to my eyes. You will truly enjoy Cleveland Tiffin!"}
{"text":"Very good my first time trying authentic Indian food. Loved the samosas and the naan.  I got vegetarian rice with extra spice which was amazing. I will be back. The cashier was also helpful"}
{"text":"If you want fresh homemade Indian food look no more, this place has great food that leaves you full and happy. We where greeted by Anup hope I am spelling his name right. He was friendly and welcoming and made our lunch one to remember! Tikka Masala was what we ordered. The food is never frozen and always cooked fresh."}
{"text":"No frills, food first, casual kind of place. For all the lack of attention paid to decor and silverware (think styrofoam plates and plastic utensils, even when dining in), I think Tiffin takes real pride in their food. But call ahead if you want any of the dishes requiring chickpeas or other beans. These require 3 hours of soaking that's not going to happen if you just walk in for lunch. It's quite disappointing to find out that half of the menu is off limits after you've spent the last 15 minutes deciding and psyching yourself up for it, as happened to my vegetarian friend. Oh well, why not drown your sorrows in a Salty Lassi or Masala Chai Tea?   \"Service\" is a term that is applied pretty liberally here, as you have to go up to the counter yourself to get a menu and pay for your food. I was almost expecting to have to get water ourselves, but the man working the front brought over a pitcher of water and two styrofoam cups after placing our orders. The whole vibe definitely fits in with a strip mall, washed-out, takeout joint. Seating is arranged in booths along the two long walls of the rectangular room, and during our late lunch just one other family came to dine in. I imagine that they don't stock much in the way of cleaning supplies since all the dishware is disposable and the table surfaces are just above the threshold of clean. But at least you know you can roll in wearing sweats, and I haven't had any digestive problems since!   We saw only one matronly chef in the kitchen prepping our food, and it came out in short order. We got a bed of chunky rice to share (meh), some Garlic Naan (B), Samosas (B+), and our individual dishes in small bowls. My Chicken Korma (solid A) was very tender and creamy, and even though I chose \"medium spicy\", I suspect the kitchen editorialized for this non-Indian diner since I didn't find it had much kick at all. The Samosas are densely packed with spiced potatoes and onions, with a thick and crispy shell. Their compact filling makes them easy to share, though I think you'll find you want to keep them for yourself. The Garlic Naan was soft and fresh, but I've had tastier. It was better used as a vessel to transfer the yummy Korma sauce from bowl to mouth. After the naan ran out, I was tempted to just lick the styrofoam clean but was stopped by propriety. Not that I think anyone there would have cared. What surprised me was my lack of productivity-crippling food coma afterwards. To be sure, the food is filling - but 1.5 samosa + 1.5 naan + Chicken Korma + 1 bowl rice later,  I didn't feel like a sack of gravy and even managed a trip to the Indian grocer a few doors down. I'll leave you with the brown man stamp of approval that my friend gave to his food."}
{"text":"Had a great takeout meal tonight! My cousin and I just moved back to Cleveland after many years in NYC, and we were very excited to find an awesome Indian place here. The owners were very kind and took time to explain the food and the love that goes into making it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop Indian take out / sit in place. warm and friendly service. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Get ready to taste some of the best Northern Indian food in the CLE area.  Be prepared, and know that they aren't really set up to dine in.  They are more or less a carry out place.  The good news is that they will deliver.  If you're in a jam, they can accommodate a few guests at some small tables, but I'd recommend the other options.  The are VERY nice people and will put the heat level wherever you are comfortable.  I could go on and on, but the other reviewers have summed it up pretty well.  Thanks to all you Yelpers out there.  Another great recommendation from the community.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We went there and got excellent foods.....malai kofta and aloo paratha are the best. We also got the biryani with maximum level of spicy...for me personally i can tolerate the spicy but it marks the favor of other herbs which i think biryani is the delicious because of favor of herbs.   As everyone mentioned, this place takes sooooo longgggggg for preparing since they made them fresh dish by dish. You really need to consider ordering by phone at least an hour ahead before you are hungry. Anyway, worth to wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been patrons for many years. We love the WEEKLY TIFFIN service delivery - it offers delicious vegetarian and non-vegetarian food with portions for a genuinely unbeatable price.   For those unfamiliar with Weekly Tiffin, it's a delivery or pick-up service (only on Mon. and Wed., need to order 1 day before!) providing 5 different dishes with or without rotis (Indian \"tortillas\"). The Weekly Tiffin is enough to feed my wife and me multiple meals throughout the week. We try to cook at home regularly, but when we are pressed for time, the Weekly Tiffin delivery is a fantastic option for quality, home-cooked food.  We really love everything on the Weekly Tiffin menu. The Fish Pakora (pairs awesomely with ice-cold beer!) and the Punjabi Kadhi Pakora are also very good and worth a try. These are uncommon finds at a typical Indian restaurant.  It's clear from the quality of the food and from interacting with the owners over the years that they are passionate about their food and committed to the quality. Go give it a try, or, if you don't want to/can't cook for a week, try out the WEEKLY TIFFIN service!"}
{"text":"Delicious, well- prepared food. We tried several dishes: chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, shahi paneer, vegetable pakora, samosa, aloo paratha, plain paratha,  and dal tadka.  The majority of the business is carry out, with a small, casual dine in section. The proprietor was friendly and helpful, making for a nice, relaxed dining experience. We really enjoyed our meals and will definitely return. As the food is prepared while you wait, allow plenty of time to enjoy your meal if you plan to dine in."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options!! Very flavorful. I particularly like the Saag Paneer and the Vegetable Curry, which was surprisingly sweet. If you like spicy, try the cauliflower. The fact that they deliver to my house in the middle of nowhere is added icing on the cake. A big hit!"}
{"text":"Wasn't disappointed at all. The man who I assume was the owner was super friendly and made ordering very easy. I ordered the Malai Kofta, a couple samosas and some veggie pakora. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing!  This is the best Indian food I've had. The chili chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Chana masala was spicy and comforting. Basmati with peas was fresh and light. I come here for work occasionally and I will definitely have to eat this food every time I return!!  Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful take-out restaurant. The Indian food is well flavored and made hot to order. I just happen to be in the area with my girlfriend and we stopped here. I didn't come to this place for the decor, I came for the wonderful authentic food made from the mother in the back. 5/5 Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I got the spicy chicken curry and my friend got the chicken Tikka Masala and we both tried each other's dishes and they were both absolutley perfect. The people there are also incredibly friendly. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This small Indian storefront take-out restaurant is a really great find, and among the most delicious, flavorful Indian cuisine I've ever had! The restaurant is geared toward take-out/carry out, although there are some booths and the owner welcomed us to sit and eat our ordered dinner. I was with two other people and we ordered butter chicken and chicken korma. Both dishes were full of flavor and very obviously freshly prepared. The owner was very friendly and explained how the food would be freshly prepared, and as we were concluding our meal, shared how he and his wife started the restaurant - originally out of their own home!!! What a wonderful dining experience, and when we are back in town we will be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Cleveland Tiffin catered our event, fantastic samosas and tiki masala! Great service!"}
{"text":"Just found this place last night. Very good food and friendly service.  We ordered Paneer Jalfrazie and Navratan Korma. Both were excellent! Will go again."}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok, but nothing to rave about at all. I walked in and the place is not very inviting, dimly lit with florescent light and old paint on the walls.  Fairly clean tho.  At lunch I was the only one there and I only saw the one server, who was mostly watching nasty court TV shows.  I ordered at the counter/bar since the server didn't come to the table.  Tried the Saag Paneer, 2 samosas, roti and Tea Masala.    It took about 15 min, and I was prepared for the wait.  Everything came out at the same time, no apps first.  Then he asked if I wanted rice, so I said sure.  Half done eating and the rice comes out.  Then as I'm finishing, my tea which I forgot about, came out in a paper cup with a lid.    The paneer lacked any depth of flavor and I even ordered it medium spice.  The rice was perfect and the tea was good. The samosas were also just OK.  I kept thinking that I've had better from the frozen aisle of my grocery store, unfortunately   With the poor service, dingy interior, and unimpressive food it's not someplace I'd go back to."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit.  The best Authentic Indian food I've ever tasted. Friendly customer service also.  Deserves 6 stars!!!!!   Update to review    Back again and each time we come the food is even more delicious   Tried the Tea massala!!!  Absolutely amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We are from the Boston area, here to visit our son. We have had our share of Indian cuisine at home. We did a little searching and decided to drive to Cleveland Tiffin for lunch.   Don't let the sparse decor fool you. They make everything fresh to order and it was delicious! There are plenty of dishes for meat eaters and also vegetarians. We ordered vegetable samosas, chicken curry, chicken vindaloo, paratha, and malai kofta.   The owners were extremely friendly and checked on us often. Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Went here for carry out because of great reviews on Yelp. This place is right near Thistledown Racino, so the area is a little sketchy. When I called to order at 5:15, I was told that it would be ready at 6:30 which surprised me. The owner explained that everything is made completely from scratch. He revised the time to 6:15. It was ready at about 6:25. But it was worth the wait. The samosas were perfect- crunchy on the outside, and very tasty inside. Malai Kofta was not what I expected. Everywhere else they are heavy and made of chick peas. Here, they were lighter and made mostly of paneer. Sauce was a bit different as well, with wonderful flavor and very unique spices. Chicken Tikka Masala likewise was unlike any we had ever had before, but perfectly spiced. I was not asked the spice level, but I would call it medium to medium hot. But it was no heat for the sake of heat. Just really tasty. The only thing I didn't care for was the bread. They don't have naan. We got parathi, and I think I just don't care for it. We will definitely be back again. If there were 4.5 stars, I'd go for that but I had to take something off for the bread and the location."}
{"text":"Cleveland Tiffin serves fresh, homemade indian food that is both tasty and healthy. Forget the cream laden curries filled with bad calories you get served at most indian restaurants and welcome to authentic food from the kitchen of an Indian mother. I love both styles of Indian food and each has its' time/place to be enjoyed. I got the bangain bartha (eggplant) and saag paneer (spinach cheese). Both were delicious and well spiced.  Cleveland Tiffin is truly a hole-in-the-wall. Located in a desolate, nondescript complex, the interior of the place is unfinished with cheesy art pieces on the wall. Old school bollywood music playing transported me to the '90s. There are a few tables, but takeout food is the entire business. You come here for the quality of food and nothing else.  I spoke briefly with the owner of Tiffin. He mentioned they are looking to launch a food truck in Cleveland next summer. Fingers crossed, would be a welcome addition to the scene!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location and exterior of the facility fool you ... the food is exquisite.  We ordered the Samosa and Paratha and it was delicious.  Had the right amount of heat and left a good tease for the main meal.  The paratha had more heat to it but was nice.  For the entrees, Vegetable Kofta curry, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Al delicious.  Favorite was butter chicken.    The service was good.  It was a mom and pop type of service and feel.  The owner was extra friendly and charming.  He even brought over some yummy carrot halwa.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  This is a little hidden gem in North Randall.  One of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland.  The owner even followed up with me after I ordered my meal.  We got Paneer pakoras, butter chicken and Samosas.  Everything seemed to be made to order so allow some time for preparation.  Great good and even better service!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming location in a small strip mall. Fortunately, these are my favorite types of eats and this place proved no less. I ordered the curry chicken at medium heat which included basmati rice. I also ordered a side of garlic naan. The curry chicken was seasoned well with the perfect amount of heat. My two year old son almost ruined my meal because he wanted to eat more than I had anticipated sharing with him.   I look forward to returning and trying out even more menu items!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Samosas not bad.  Entrees just ok.  Man behind the counter was very pleasant."}
{"text":"This establishment operates on the concept of the \"Indian work lunch\". It is best that you pre-order at least one day ahead and have them deliver to you the next day. This is not the place you order on the same day and expect a quick turn around in 20 minutes. The kitchen opens at 11:30am. So even if you place an order earlier than that, expect some serious wait time. If you want food delivered, you have to call one day ahead because they need to arrange it with  their deliver guy.  Food:  Tiffin specializes in north Indian style cuisine. That means...get your dosa at Taste of Kerala in Mayfield Heights.  The owner's mom cooks all the food. It's very home-made. Another reason that the food here takes time.  What I order here: Mutter Paneer. Butter chicken. Paratha. When ordering, I emphasize I want non spicy at all. Not even mild, just zero spiciness.   Goat curry available on Friday only, because it takes 4 hours to make."}
{"text":"Excellent Punjabi food.  So glad we found this place. House made and fresh tasting (never had saag paneer that still the plant taste of spinach, not cooked out of it). In both the paneer jalfrezi and saag paneer, the cheese tasted fresh. On the long stretch of highway between Erie PA and Columbus OH there's nothing this good."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade style food. I hate when Indian restaurants out cream in  everything!! My only critique is i was expecting rajma for my weekly Tiffin pack. I drove a long way for this dish bc it was on the weekly menu. However, they forgot to update menu and there was no rajma in my meal. They apologized and offered free rajma another time so that was nice. Just call to confirm dishes for the weekly menu. Otherwise food was delicious and I'll come back! I'm very happy with the service and the amount of food i got. I'm an Indian so i know good food when i taste it and this was the best take out Indian food :"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience! The food was amazing, the owners were extremely nice, and I truly enjoyed my time. The owner, Mr. Anoop, gave us the story behind the name \"Tiffin\" and many other stories. It was as if I was at his kitchen table at home and the hospitality was amazing!!!! I can't wait to go back, learn, eat well, and have an awesome time! It was a great BFF outing."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the owner is so nice. The food was very fresh and the best Indian food I've tried in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Oh ho ho, What an experience! Our order was: samosas, garlic naan, palek paneer, and goat saag.  I am definitely coming back.   You know how home cooking tastes the same but different in a restaurant? It's like tasting the comfort of being in their home, but you're not! That's how I felt about this place compared to other Indian restaurants. It did not seem like some MSG mess, but pure in flavor.   We did take out, and it did take like 45 minutes. They make everything fresh! So don't think it's gunna be fast. And don't come here if you're expecting a fancy setting, it's very relaxed. The owner/cook and the host were very very nice. I don't think the photos online of the food are actually them, just some generic photo of the food. I ordered based off the picture but it didn't look like that (but still dddddddelicious)."}
{"text":"I've been ordering their weekly veggie tiffin meals a few weeks now (sometimes with and sometimes without roti) and I have to say so far all the meals have been wonderful. They rotate their weekly menu so no getting bored of the same dishes. Highly recommend to give it a try if you want prepped meals for the week."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is amazing and cooked fresh, with very large portions and amazing seasonings. The owner was very friendly and personable,  coming out to talk to customers. So greatful that i stumbled upon this gem!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and interesting freshly-made food with made-to-order spiciness.  It's not dirt-cheap, but prices are reasonable for the heap of food you get.  (To-go boxes are available.) Dishes are excellent for sharing.  In terms of ambiance, Tiffin is not a restaurant but a spartan storefront for pick-up and catering.  Nonetheless, there is some comfortable seating and available drinks.  If you enjoy an authentic hole-in-the wall with tasty cuisine and low overhead, then this is your spot for dinner or lunch.  Dropping by the Indo-Pak grocery next door makes for a worthwhile trip, too."}
{"text":"very good Indian food, and really good customer service. owner actually texted me about an hour after delivery to ask how everything was, very cool. glad I found this place, not many Indian options outside of Choolah in this part of town. stay away from chains and support local business! nice job Cleveland Tiffin."}
{"text":"Cleveland Tiffin is definitely the go-to spot in Cleveland for authentic Indian food.  We called in our order and drove over to pick it up.  We were given piping hot samosas as we waited for our freshly cooked food.  We ordered the chicken tikka and it was wonderful.  Couldn't have more authentic food if it was made by our mothers!  Will definitely be going back.  An ideal spot for busy professionals/medical students/medical residents to pick up food for the week.  (This is not however a place for a sit-down meal...more-so a storefront for pick-up)."}
{"text":"\"Home Fresh Food Cooked to Order\"   This a TRUE taste of India!  The food is as fresh as it gets SO you will have to wait a few minutes. (There is a wonderful Indian store a few doors down you can visit while you wait).  You can also call ahead.  Either way, it is absolutely worth the wait.  I ordered the Chicken Korma and it was DECADENT!  The spices and flavor were fresh, full and numerous.   If you do decide to eat there, which you can, there are about 6-8 tables if you want a place to sit down and enjoy their flavorful, authentic food but most people take it home/work.    The owner was an absolute gentleman.  When he told us we would have to wait a few minutes for our dishes he looked worried because I could tell he took pride in pleasing the customer, (Customers FIRST).  It was NOT an issue because with the Indian store a few doors down and we told him we would see him in a \"30 min\".  On our arrival back he was ready for us and said, \"We're bagging it right now but I have something for you.\" He came up to us with a small tray of what he called \"Indian French Fries\" (not on the menu...YET) and let us try some of them and they were a tasty little treat.  He truly LOVES what he does and even told us, \"This isn't just a business but this is our passion.\" AMAZING.   We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped by here a week ago and it's really good! I especially liked the samosas. I wasn't a fan of the disposable dishes/silverware because it seemed wasteful. The food itself was still good though!"}
{"text":"Malai Kofta, Chana Masala and eggplant were all delicious. The best Indian cuisine I've had in Cleveland. Already signing up for the tiffin service for next week. Owner was charming and clearly cares about his customers."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're craving Indian food! I have tried the butter chicken and chicken saag. It was really good. I would order ahead of time and I can definitely see myself doing a lot of take-out here. Good service. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"This was a lovely dinner to end our time away in Cleveland.  Our AirBnB host listed this restaurant as one of the popular venues and that people drive hours to go there because it is that good.  It is a Punjabi family-owned establishment and they are putting their heart and soul into the food.  Is it an instagram curated venue?  No, however that shouldn't matter.  The food quality is fresh and that should speak volumes.  All of our dishes - vegetable pakora, chicken tikka masala, chicken biriyani and chicken korma exceeded our expectations, which are quite high since we eat Indian food regularly.  Prepare yourself for the wait by calling your order in beforehand, even if you are dining in.  I didn't feel like I was in a restaurant, I truly felt like I was in their home.  If I am back in Cleveland I will definitively go back to this restaurant and sample some of their other items.  Balle balle!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Indian food. I ordered off of Uber Eats and got some recommendations from a friend. The butter chicken was amazing had a little bit of the spicy kick to it. The rice I found to be dry and clumpy. The naan bread Was very chewy but had good flavor. I assume that if I ate the bread in the restaurant instead of ordering it to go it would be much better. I would eat here again, but would not order the naan on a to go order. I also had the samosas. It is a potato filled pastry what spices. It had some interesting with spices in it like Cara way and the sauce was a little bit spicy had some flavors that I could not identify. It was interesting but not something I would order again. Overall I was happy with the chicken and I am excited to try more of their entrée dishes. Skip on the sides."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelpers! This was a great find for good, tasty, and reasonably priced Indian dishes. We ordered chicken korma and Tika masala-flavors on spot indeed.   This place is not as swanky as Saffron Patch, nor as hip as Choolah. However, if you are craving for Indian food in the Warrensville and surrounding areas, this is a winner.  I do wish that they provided more rice (personal preference), and I felt that the masala sauce was not as thick as I want it to be. Again, it's more of a personal preference.   So what are you waiting for? Go venture and try this place out. They would gladly adjust the heat and spice level for you :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight because of the good yelp reviews, overall I thought my chicken tikka masala and samosas were pretty average. Nothing that I would ever go out of my way to ever get again! I love samosas but they were far too greasy to enjoy. I'll stick to meatless Monday at Whole Foods lol."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we drove past Cleveland Tiffin on our way to oil change one day and we decided to give it a shot. Cleveland Tiffin is where we go for authentic home-cooked Indian meal - just like how mom cooks - not too much oil/grease/masalas, unlike restaurants.  The food is truly yummilicious, unlike most Indian restaurants in the area. We order and call ahead (they also have a daily menu) and have enjoyed everything we have ordered here. Our favorite 5 are: saag, chicken tikka masala, Punjabi pakora kadhi, mattar paneer, and rajma chawal. We also love the samosas and pakoras here. And the chilly chicken, goat curry, besan gatte ki sabji, aloo baingan and baingan bharta. LOL yes we love everything we have ever tried here! Cannot wait to try their aloo poori masala, chole poori/bhature, karela and zucchini!  Give them a call :)"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have discovered Cleveland Tiffin. Everything I have tried from them has been so delicious! My husband and I ordered the chili chicken (which I would definitely get again) and saag paneer the first time, along with samosas and aloo paratha. The saag was smooth as silk, and everything was beautifully seasoned, with less salt than I expect from a restaurant, more like home cooking. Today we had chicken curry and chicken tikka masala, plus green peppers and potatoes. Again, everything was top notch. The curry vindaloo was super hot but soooo good. This is definitely my go to Indian place from now on. Can't recommend it highly enough-- exceptional food in an unexpected location."}
