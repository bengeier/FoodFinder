{"text":"I learned early on in life that you pay for what you get. Here is the perfect example. 
If you are trying to eat on a budget go elsewhere. If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want a fabulous meal Thyme is one of the best restaurants in the area.
Everything that I have ever ordered here has been very good.
Location could be better. The menu makes up for what the location lacks. 
*I've read that a move may happen in the near future.

I will definitely be back! 
Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"totally great place to go. Took my mom and her husband out there when they came out from NY. Couldn't take my daughter, because we couldn't get a reservation...have to plan ahead!
We have had the pizzas and burgers and a delicious appetizer that was shrimp bruchetta.
Love that it is handicapped accessable (even if it is by the downstairs door) so I can bring friends in wheelchairs. Love watching the kitchen too. All the people working there seem very good and very nice.
sorry it is getting so popular."}
{"text":"I have the pleasure of eating dinner and a customer luncheon this weak. The quality of food was absolutely great.  I would without  a doubt highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely dine there on my next visit to Medina. Should all restaurants prepare food of such taste and quality."}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in Medina (although its only real competition is Main Street Cafe and the Oaks).  I've been there twice, and was happy with my meal both times.  The first time I had the entree portion of the gnocchi, which was very tasty without being too heavy.  The second time I had the macadamia nut crusted grouper.  The fish was sliiiightly undercooked, but everything else with it was good -- especially the black chinese rice.  The wine list is short, but very good, and has lots of good, small California wineries on it -- yay!

The prices seem a bit steep for Medina, but perhaps that's the cost of eating seafood in the midwest.  And it might be nice to have a real vegetarian entree on the menu (rather than just a large version of an appetizer)."}
{"text":"I was expecting good food and great service based on the reviews so far. I was disappointed. The waiter took entirely too long to get to our table, forgot to take the drink order and never bothered to check in mid way.

I am not coming back here."}
{"text":"First timers w/a friend in from Atlanta last night. Had the Mussels (WOW were they good especially in the chipotle sauce w/their bread to dip!) as an appetizer. Shared the pork chop & seafood fettuccine. Chop was amazing & seafood pasta portion was large and tasty. Will be back"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Medina, and one of the best in Northeast Ohio.  We have eaten here a number of times over the past two years and have had a great meal every time.  The menu changes seasonally and includes interesting american grill that emphasizes local ingredients.  The meats are wonderful, fresh and perfectly cooked.  Sauces are subtle and deep, the bread is fantastic, and desserts are amazing.  Prices are reasonable for the high quality of the food - comparable to the other high-end restaurants in town.  

This is also a fun place to eat, with a nice bar and good service.  And you will likely get a visit from the owner/chef.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Resturaunt in Medina with the freshest fish /meats and vegetables.  If you enjoy good quality food this one is a winner!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to dine at Thyme during my recent visit to Medina. I ordered a Greek chicken salad for lunch and it was quite good. What I liked is that they pickle the red onion so that you don't get that hard bite of onion and are left with onion breath the rest of the day!  Anyway, it was very good.  Service was fine, nothing exceptional or negative. 

I thought that their lunch menu was a bit limited with only sandwiches and salads. However it seems like no matter what you order, it would be a good meal."}
{"text":"Something different from all of the chain restaurants in Medina.  There is a pub menu that has really good burgers and pizzas for a fair price.  You can even sit at the bar right in front of the kitchen.  There is also a more sophisticated menu with plenty of great options, plus a lot of unique cocktails."}
{"text":"Difficult to actually find this little gem but certainly worth it. Excellent mussels, love the Caesar salad as the caramelized onions made it terrifically different. The Grouper entree was perfect portion and accompanying side dishes were very good.   Went on a Thursday night without reservations and had a choice of pub, upscale dining but patio was booked. Nice decor and service. Very attentive."}
{"text":"They have moved! New location is listed correctly on Yelp. The new space is just off  Medina Square and the actual entrance is by the parking area to the West of South Court street.
The food is still great, with a new \"fine dining\" area upstairs as you enter, and a \"pub\" area downstairs featuring a more casual decor with an open kitchen and a pizza oven. The pizzas are all great and even the \"standard\" sausage pizza is very tasty. I also love their burgers and yummy fries! Their salads are very tasty as well and their pan roasted chicken is excellent. The owner and chef, John Kolar, has a solid background, having worked at a variety of excellent restaurants and with Doug Katz at Moxie and Fire."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing...triple grilled cheese, pulled pork sandwich, Cobb salad & margherita pizza.  Great service and cool outdoor dining.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and loved the menu , I had the Filet and it was prepared perfectly 
The roasted chicken was great . Would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great food and service is always amazing. I've told everyone to try this place- you WON'T be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Thyme around 5 on a Friday night and sat at the bar.  It got busy very quickly.  They have many choices as far as wine and cocktails go. I had a glass of a Malbec which was excellent. Also, they have special cocktails and wines that they serve each month. My mom and I split the spinach salad to start with; it was dressed wonderfully. We then split the lobster pizza. After living in Italy for 1.5 years recently, I must say that the pizza at Thyme might be as good as it is in Italy. The crust was not too thick, just the way I like it.  They were generous with giving us many pieces of lobster. It also has roasted garlic, caramelized onions and manchego cheese...all of my favorite things!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a cousin in Medina, and this was one of 3 restaurants she suggested for lunch.  I'm glad we picked this place, because it's awesome.  The service is great, and the food is better.  My friend and I shared the Kraut Balls (which are awesome and everyone should order), the Hot Betty and the pulled pork sandwich, and we loved everything!  My cousin had a BLT, and my aunt had something else I can't remember and we all loved our meals.  This is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Two and half hours later! This place way over rated. Slow to serve. Complaining does nothing. Meat was over cooked. The only thing tasted good was the fries. Save your money and don't go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting place with two very different feels. We entered thru the dinner section and went downstairs to the lunch dining area. Each section is very warm and has a receptive ambiance.  There is a very nice outdoor dining area as well. I had the four cheese and sausage pizza. My wife had the cheeseburger. Without a doubt this is this best pizza crust I have encountered. The pizza is baked in a brick style oven and is around 8-10 inches  perfect for one person or two with an average appetite  While I'm not ready to de-throne Isabella's in Baltimore for best pizza quite yet I think that with my favorite toppings this pizza could compete very well. The hamburger was very good as well. Very juicy and thick. Plenty of tasty fries that we both could share due to the generous helping. Great atmosphere and the staff was very friendly as well. Located in the heart of Medina it makes for a very nice experience. 4.5/5 from me and I would recommend very highly. 

Pros; great pizza and burgers. Asteroids arcade game. Nice decor and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Fair prices for fresh and well thought out food. 

Cons; privacy fence between urinals would be a plus."}
{"text":"Love the ability to order from either the Fine Dining or Pub Menu from anywhere in the House.  Very few bad choices here... Gen. Mgr. works the whole restaurant, so quality of food and service is great."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Medina on business and after reading some restaurant reviews I chose Thyme. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Everything I had was excellent and the wine list was small but outstanding. If I'm ever in Medina again I will definitely go back."}
