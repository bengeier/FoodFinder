{"text":"I've been around the blocks a few times and I do know my pizza. It's g-d's perfect food, if it's made right. We all like our favourite style of pizza, be it either Chicago's Deep Dish, Montreal's Greco-Roman or the real deal, Neapolitan thin crust; it's all good because we each have different tastes. How else to judge a pizzaiolo's work but to sample a simple Margherita pizza?  My take on Brigade's version of Margherita pizza is that the dough was a tad chewy, the tomato sauce a bit watery and the fresh basil shouldn't be baked with the pizza. Oh yeah one more thing, I wanted my pizza baked a longer, but they couldn't or wouldn't follow that simple instruction. You shouldn't assume you know better than what the customer likes. As for the restaurant itself it's located downtown in the heart of tourist territory yet I had to translate the wall menu for our American guests because it's only posted in French. Not nice !!!! The pizza was edible , out of 10 I'd give it a 6.5."}
{"text":"Pizza was perfectly cooked. Ingredients are always fresh. Verre Pizza Napolitana at its finest. We are lucky to have this shop in Montreal. Great prices. Great food. Great concept"}
{"text":"A bit upset by the reviews here, especially by the folks saying this is not authentic. The dough tastes exactly like a number of places I went to in Napoli. If you don't like this style of pizza there's no need to review it poorly, just don't come here :-) Ranting aside: friendly service, fresh ingredients, and a tasty affordable custom pizza in a nice casual spot."}
{"text":"Mesculin salad and Hawaiian pizza ala Napolitaine style...very tasty! Quick service,  quality Ingredients friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 star, I would. The concept is cool and the staff is nice, but the pizza I got was repellent to say the least. As a place who specializes in pizzas, I was expected more. The pizza itself was soggy, tasteless and the crust was burnt. ( the whole pizza was black ) I had the \" le chevre \" and needless it was a no for me"}
{"text":"I really rarely post reviews if ever. My family and I get a \"cheat meal\" once a week and we're major foodies who research before we get stuff. We wanted pizza and we wanted to get our usual Il Focolaio but they were closed so we opted for Brigade.   Ordered 4 pizzas. One of them was the signature Broco - they tell us they're out of broccolinis. No problem stuff happens we change that pizza to something completely different. Oops they don't have chicken. Okay we change the pizza again. Another pizza was their Reine DOP - opps they don't have mozarella di bufala. Mind you I wasn't going to write a negative review over this as we are super understanding people and I worked in the restaurant industry I know sometimes it's out of your control especially after busy nights.  We get home - open the margherita pizza with added mushrooms - literally No sauce anywhere except on the edges near the crust. (when I tell you the middle was just cheese no sauce. The cheese was directly on the dough - and literally no sauce and definitely no crushed tomatoes lol. And only half the pizza had mushrooms scattered near the crust. Even then - our other margherita was fine and had sauce perfectly spread across the whole pizza so I was like maybe they just did this one wrong. But at this point stuff was starting to accumulate and my patience running low. I basically spent 50$ to eat burnt dough with no sauce. There goes my cheat meal.  In all fairness - the Reine DOP was the only one out of 4 pizzas that was enjoyable. But even then - it was nothing to rave or write about.   I honesty don't remember last time I was dissatisfied with a meal to this extent both with service, quality and straight up just the taste - I had no interest in finishing my pizza. When is the last time you finished a pizza slice and weren't absolutely craving the next one? I didn't even think it was possible. It was absolutely not worth the money nor the time. Do yourself a favour and try some other place. Il focolaio's crushed tomatoes base alone is to die for and Bros also had a good pizza. By all means save your money and go somewhere else if you feel like indulging in a treat."}
{"text":"Took my family with 3 kids ages 9 to 14 and we had a quick delicious no stress meal.  Staff is kind and helpful and very tolerant of we non-french speaking itinerant americans.  Simple but infinitely variable menu of toppings and pizza styles was explained adequately.  We selected a simple Margherita for kids but I strongly suggest adding extra cheese to suit their high dairy palates while wife and I enjoyed a white with various more sophisticated vegetable toppings.  All was delicious though we had an abundance of extra pizza crust which was quickly resolved by realizing it is absolutely delicious when eaten with high quality olive oil of 2 flavors placed thought fully at each table.  Once kids also tried this the once considered inedible outer crusts were rapidly and to our surprise happily also consumed.  Nothing was left to take home, meal was inexpensive at about 50 Canadian for 5 with soda and one acceptable Caesars salad - probably the only weak link in an otherwise wholly satisfying meal.  Sadly dessert options were limited to Nutella pizza and there is a limit to how far we can go with cooked pizza - even for pizza lovers like us.  Also my son is nut allergic  (which again the staff handled with consideration and professionalism/kindness).  In total I'd say it was a five star (maybe 4.5 because of lack of dessert options) overall meal and experience."}
{"text":"Simple. Best pizza I have ever had. Imagine a pizza it's no cheese and you don't miss it? Order the Napolitana and enjoy. Cooks were a hoot."}
{"text":"Not exactly pizzas. More like thick pita bread with toppings of your choice. Toppings were unevenly distributed. I got a clump of garlic at one corner bite. Bottom of the bread were burnt and toppings are still lukewarm. There's a reason why real traditional Italian places knows how to control the heat and make a thoroughly baked pizza. It really comes with experiences. This is just subway sandwich style pizza. Cool concept but not nearly impressive."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza in downtown Montreal. Fast, delicious, unique experience. The crust is so wonderful after coming out of an authentic fire oven... Very hard to find!"}
{"text":"It's very exotic for pizza, I mean I eat pizza all the time but I felt like I could taste Italy a bit if that makes sense. The crust is thin but still filling, nice ambiance. You get to see them make them."}
{"text":"You can customize pizza or pasta the way you want. Kids love it   Staff is super friendly  Price is reasonable"}
{"text":"Great concept - Make your own pizza.   The pizza tastes so fresh and authentic and is cook beautifully in the wood fire ovens in less than 2 minutes. The ingredients are prime quality and certainly taste like it.   All fresh, nothing tastes canned, premade or frozen.   Great experience overall, and reasonable on the pricing.   Organization lacks a bit, but let's give these guys a break they've just opened."}
{"text":"Affordable and great tasting pizza. Went today for lunch and got there just before 12. Lucky we did as the line went out the door after that. Ordering is simple,  choose from a variety of base pizzas and then add what you like on top. I went for the plain Margarita pizza and it did not disappoint. My friend got the same but added Italian sausage and pepperoni.  He's Italian and has had Neapolitan pizza in Italy and said this is very close.  Dough was crispy and a bit smoky from the burnt bits. Make sure you dip the crust in the crushed red chili oil, delish.    Will definitely be back. Great spot for lunch to those who work in the area.   Buon appetito"}
{"text":"This place falls flat. The pizza was not baked properly, very soggy in the middle. Even though it's baked right there, it was not hot enough by the time the pizza was brought to the table. People behind the counter making the pizza seemed completely uninterested and aloof. Toppings did not seem fresh. Overall a disappointing experience. The place was not clean with dust and crumbs all over. The concept is a good one but the execution is just not there."}
{"text":"Great little find for a delish pizza.  The array of available toppings in plain view was enticing.  My husband and I had a late lunch and wanted just a little something at 9:30pm and sharing a pizza was just right, but one pizza per person might be better for a dinner portion.  Also enjoyed one of four beers on tap.  The Creemore Springs lager was a nice discovery for visitors from Orange County, CA like us. We also enjoyed the blues/R&B background music.  Very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"A bit busy and chaotic walking in but staff is efficient and fast. I had the salsiccia et poivrons added oregano and mushrooms. Potentially the best pizza I've ever had! Restaurant quality with the ease of take out. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Walked in after a long, cold shopping day lured by the promise of a Neapolitan pizza. I loved the premise of a build your own pizza, the variety of ingredients and the lay out of the place...the actual pizza not so much. I had the margherita base (tomato sauce, grana padano cheese, Fior Di latte mozzarella) and added spinach. On the plus side, the sauce was pretty good, the Fior di latte was fresh and not terrible and the spinach was generous. On the negative side, the actual pizza dough was very bland and the pizza was too thin resulting in a soggy mess that was difficult to cut and almost impossible to eat with your hands.   My friends had the same feedback adding that the price goes up quickly when you start adding toppings at 1.50$ a pop."}
{"text":"Not loud and messy as a Neapolitan pizzeria, but this place makes a pizza that brings you very close to the taste of the traditional one you can try in Naples. When we got in it was quite busy, but in about ten minutes we were sitting with one of the best Margherita ever tried so far outside Italy. Wood oven, a wide choice of fresh and good-looking ingredients and the possibility to make your own pizza while watching the staff prepare it. If I was still in Montreal, I would certainly come back here. 5 stars."}
{"text":"The staff here are friendly and competent but ultimately the pizza is not up to snuff. The place is extremely new and very comfortable but the pizza itself is tiny. Each serving is not enough for a meal yet they charge more than $10 for most pizzas. My pizza came out super burnt and so did my friend's. We will not be coming back. There are many better places in the neighbourhood where you can get better bang for your buck and an edible pizza with no black crusts."}
{"text":"Pizza and salad were very good. Just opened so service was friendly but a little a confused as they still seem to be learning the ropes."}
{"text":"Les deux grand four à bois concept intéressant je pense que C pas facile de cuire uniformément il faut constamment tournez les pizza sinon ça va noircir le chef est très focus pour nous assuré une bonne pizza excellente job la pizza 3 fromages est sorti du four Safe toute la différence C le four à bois quel bon pizza"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with a friend. The good - delicious pizza, well priced which may explain a little skimping on the basil. Had the Margherita with cremini mushrooms. Would have preferred variety of mushrooms. Tasty marinara sauce and excellent mozzarella. Crust slightly blackened but still good. Adequate selection of draft beers - perfect choice with pizza.  The bad - no greeting when we arrived. Awkward moment trying to figure out how their system works. The line starts where the pizzas are being prepared and it would have been nice if one of the staff asked us if this was our first visit and could they help us. Instead we asked a lot of questions and felt like we were intruding on their work. Confusion and delays while a new person was training at the cash - inconsistent supervision.  My friend had to return to ask for her beer that was never poured. Decor is appropriate but lighting at tables could be improved.  Wifi nice touch.  But  my worst complaint - no English on the overhead menus! And when asked, it was not even in the planning.  Left a message for the owner to call me to ask about this and will follow up with his response.  Follow up:  Left two messages with two polite young ladies, one named Jen, can't remember the second gal, asking the owner if he could call me. I simply said I wanted to speak to him regarding the resto.  I have not received any response.  Definitely won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this order! While the flavours and crust of the pizza were awesome, the rest of it might as well have not been cooked! The dough on the bottom was floppy, uncooked, and couldn't even support the toppings. I would like to believe it was because I had it delivered, but there is no way 10 minutes in a car made a crust that soggy."}
{"text":"This a great option for a quick stop for lunch or a late night snack. I like the concept where you can chose a base and then add toppings to your hearts delight.   I ordered a margarita and added a couple of toppings to half the pizza. I wanted to be able to taste the pure margarita on the other half. The tomato sauce is solid but not noteworthy and the crust was a little more chewy/soggy than I like.   Overall it was a good pizza, but not up to the top spots in town. It is very convenient and the service was quick, so I will be back again"}
{"text":"Great pizza, built to order as you watch.  Cooked perfectly in a wood fired oven."}
{"text":"I love how this pizzeria allows you to choose what you want and delivers authentic ingredients. I chose to have basil, prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella on my pizza. It was delicious. They cooked the pizza in a brick oven, so the pizza cooked evenly. When it came out, the cheese was so gooey and it looked too good to be true. The bill came up to about $17 but the price depends on what you want as your toppings on your pizza. I wold definitely recommend this place if you were going to make your pizza at home, but got too lazy. We all have those days. The restaurant is self serve. Once you order, you sit yourself down (I recommend towards the back, they have cute little picnic tables) and they have water available free of charge. The portion size is decent; there is enough for you to take home a slice or split with someone else. All in all, good pizza place!"}
{"text":"Nice staff very friendly and patient in explaining how you make a perfect choice where you make you own pizza indeed. The prices reasonable and pizzas maybe not perfectly perfect but good. Only reason i give four stars is having got a slightly burnt pizza a day when i guess was due to load of customers."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place out. I went in, was given a menu. Waited for 30 minutes (place was DEAD) and NO ONE came. Left."}
{"text":"Good European style pizza at a fair price and prepared in 5 minutes. It's perfect for a quick, not so healthy lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Great place! I got the plain margherita (8.95+tx), but they have a very wide selection for you to choose from. The pizza was larger than I thought it would be, for the price, but they do skimp on the basil. The crust is THIN. Thinner than I've ever experienced. Very delicious.  It's a fast casual kind of place, though not that fast. I went during off-peak hours so I was the only one there, and I was still confused about where to order and where to pay. There were a bunch of employees just standing around looking confused and no one offered to help me. It was a little weird.  There's a lot of seating available, which is nice! I like the modern decor. They have glasses and a self-serve water tap.  This place isn't perfect, but I'm giving it four stars for the delicious pizza, variety of options, non-dingy decor (which is all too common in the area) and affordability. Good choice for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"So many options for toppings and such great thin crust pizza. I wish there was a half-size option, the full size is pretty large and ends up being 2 meals worth for me. I guess I shouldn't complain, the leftovers are always yum!"}
{"text":"This is a middle of the pack pizza place it's saving grace is that it's downtown and it's has a wood burning oven. The ingredients left me unimpressed and there was flies in the restaurant falling into your food and beer.  Go to square Philip In front of the bay on st-Catherine for better pizza called ill foccailo or head to little Italy to pizza Neapolitan or Gema."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We wanted white sauce which they didn't have but instead we had olive oil with a bit of marinara sauce. We like the option of choosing all the toppings. The price was a bit high, $14 for one pizza seems like a lot being that it's meant for one person to eat. We did end up sharing one as we weren't that hungry. We'd  definitely come back to this place when we return to Montréal."}
{"text":"Best pizza/price/convenience in the city. The fact that you can pick your toppings in a subway-style setting is awesome and probably why this place is doing so well. 10/10 every time."}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, I got excited about finding a place that does unlimited toppings, so was expecting something like Blaze Pizza (which was my go-to). But I was disappointed, just because the expectations were that. For an unlimited topping, which you would fill up on obviously, the crust cannot really handle that and with one cheese option, it isn't really balanced out. I would still go there again, when looking for a decent priced pizza with everything they have (almost literally)."}
{"text":"I decided to come here as part of pizzafest 2017. I am assuming this is a newcomer as I have been across the street at Deville dinebar many times. I thought the name was pretty original and design kind of does resemble a fire station. The concept here is more fast food  than fine dining with choice of making your own pizza ($15 avg), pastas, salads- fountain drinks and wine by the glass or bottle (good selection).   I asked the head chef what was his feature pizza for pizzafest, he seemed stumped. He looked around at his colleagues and then said,\" well it's hard too explain- there is a white cream sauce base and some other ingredients\". I was puzzled and kind of disappointed - you guys are a pizza shop! You should be able to explain your feature pizza ingredients to clients!   So I settled for a goat cheese pizza with fresh mozzarella, salami, sun dried tomatoes, caramelized onions and spinach à la Nona. The pizza was a decent size easy to share or eat on your own. I found the base crust to be super soggy so none of the toppings were holding -and the tomatoe sauce was tart. My dad owned a pizzeria - I know my pizza- I have had 99 cents pizza better than this. On top of that all- the pizza was served cold - since a server delivered our order giving us a number at a table. The complimentary olive oil and chili flakes (not spicy at all) were a nice touch to each table.  Also the female bathrooms were out of order-not the best bet for a restaurant.  Weak pizzafest2017 contender, on to the next location!"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. We've been here several times and we have found it to be inconsistent. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's really nothing special. We love the thin crust of Neapolitan pizza, but they make the dough way too thin that none of the toppings stick to it. So the pizza falls apart completely. But since the pizza in Montreal is quite terrible this place isn't too bad. It's easy and fast if you're on a tight schedule (before a movie for example, since it's close to the cinema)."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza crust around,   it's the same type of pizza that's sold in fancy Italian places like Bottega, but with a fast food concept that's great for a lunch break.  I had their most basic pizza so i can judge the basics, just tomato sauce and it was divine. I made the mistake of requesting tuna as a topping, they put the equivalent of a small can. The taste was too strong, but once scraped off, it was all good again.  The most amazing thing I had was the a Panuozzo, an Italian pizza folded onto itself (normally no sauce and not folded onto itself like a calzone)  The Chevre had a ton of goat cheese, peppers and another ton of prosciutto  cotto.  I like my food hot and this thing was still piping hot after almost 15 minutes.  The prices might seem steep at first, but it is quality in a downtown area that is brimming with disgusting by-the-slice type of places that is getting worse all the time."}
{"text":"I think this place is nice as a novelty, they customize the pizza right in front of you and it's ready in under 5 minutes! Unfortunately the pie itself was not good. I got the classic margherita with mushrooms on half and the entire pizza was soggy and became unappetizing. The guy offered to make me a new one but I was so put off from everything, I politely declined. From the only slice I was able to eat, the crust reminded me of cardboard and the sauce seemed to be missing something. The place is clean and people are really nice but there are better pizza spots close by."}
{"text":"I had the vegan pizza. Loved the toppings but the tomato sauce tasted the old garlic (you know when it's mushy and it's been in the jar for a while, then it tastes like concentrate and you don't get this light flavour anymore). Price is good, especially for the vegan pizza, but I wouldn't come back because the dough was too soggy. The issue was not that it was wet, but that the dough was almost elastic. When you're vegan, you rely on the taste of the sauce and the dough + toppings. Toppings were fine but the sauce and dough couldn't save it."}
{"text":"Pizza guys at oven were not experienced. I timed my pizza Marinara. They over cooked it. Pizza should be out in 60 secs. Mine was out in approx 3 min. The concept is awesome but competence is very low from staff point of view. I'm still planning to go back though, I love pizza Napoletana :-)"}
{"text":"Really affordable thin crust pizza. If you like Neapolitan style pizza, this is the best value-place in downtown Montreal.  Self-service and you can choose any topping you want to create your own, including Nutella pizza.  Price is between 7.50-11 CAD (Nutella is cheaper, 5.5 CAD).  Fast and friendly service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was alright...nothing out of the ordinary...they were skimpy on the toppings and the middle of my pizza was pretty soggy...I've had better"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been here more than a few times now and think it's finally time for an actual review instead of just the shout out from my happy tummy:) Here goes. This is hands down my preferred pizza place because the taste and crust are top notch. I love the chili oil they provide on the table (nothing beats a great olive oil!) and appreciate how quickly my pizza  is ready! Already looking forward to my next pizza here. Get in my belly!"}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker, I'm a picky Pizza eater but I'm glad while in Montreal on a cold day we stumbled into Brigade Pizzeria.   They have a whole menu of pizza options but similar to a salad bar, the 4 of us ordered personal pies and got to choose all toppings.  They have 2 huge wood fire ovens which cooks the pies within minutes.   I have a feeling if I lived or worked in the area I'd be a regular for its fast, casual and delicious fare."}
{"text":"Not bad. Came here for date night and I love that they have make your own options.  Ordered some spaghetti with bolognese and a pizza with olives, bacon, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto. The pasta was good but nothing outstanding. The pizza has crust that was a bit too burnt for my taste and it was also very watery so it didn't hold its shape well. It was good though.   It's good food and ok-ish priced, just nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"It's a fun place to have a quick and casual meal. The concept is good, basically you build your own pizza form the Sauce, the dough to the toppings. Not the best pizza I ever had but a cool concept like the pasta placed brought to pizza with a more than fair price"}
{"text":"We went out of our way to try this place, in a quest for good authentic pizza. As someone who enjoys pizza without cheese due to lactose intolerance a great crust and sauce are vital. This marinara did not disappoint and the rapid fire cooking in the fiery wood stove makes all the difference in the world. The olives were a bit too salty so I'd opt for capers next time. The other pizzas with cheese and anchovies were all approved by my family. A great inexpensive, fast and delicious meal so we'll be back to try more options."}
{"text":"Terrible service. J'ai appelé pour faire préparer ma commande à l'avance et l'employé au téléphone me disait que la pizza que je voulais commander, du menu, n'existait pas. Malgré que je lui dise qu'elle était sur le menu et que je l'avais commandé auparavant, l'employé disait qu'elle n'existait pas. J'ai donc du me rendre sur place et pointer du menu la pizza (qui existait bien) et eue été servi par l'employé en question avec manque de respect et arrogance. Dernière fois que je dépense mon argent à Brigade. Je vous recommande d'aller a Anton & James, meilleure pizza et des employés qui savent comment traiter les clients."}
{"text":"Well you cannot get better than this when you are not in Napoli. Fast service, wood fired oven, many alternatives, good location etc. Also home made lemonade is available."}
{"text":"They actually have 2 wood fired ovens in the restaurant to bake your pizza nice and crisp! I tried this during the summer and it was great.  However, there are a couple caveats to this, those who want to eat halal or kosher will find that their toppings like the prosciutto, ham, pepperoni, sausage, etc. won't leave them with much alternatives apart from chicken (which looked rather dry). They do have lots of fresh mozzarella cheese and other cheeses to top the pizza and you can choose as many as you want. Be forewarned that the price adds up quite significantly as you choose different sauces and toppings.  Their eating area would fit into a casual dining experience, but they do provide real utensils and plates! They have their customization counter right front of you but it doesn't necessarily make them more generous with the toppings.  I split a 3 veggie topped pizza with my friend for $22 in total. So, if you crave a very simple pizza à la Napolitan, come here, but if you prefer north American styled greasy loaded pizzas for cheap you're better off choosing dominoes/double pizza or any other delivery pizza =)"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh ca faisait très longtemps que je n'avais pas mangé une pizza au feu de bois et je vous recommande fortement brigade pizzeria napolitaine, vous pouvez faire votre propre pizza base tomate, fromage et garnitures illimités pour 13.45$ !!!!!! Après vous avez des signatures comme La calzone, La 4 fromages et j'en passe je vous laisse le plaisir de venir voir toute les pizzas qu'il vous propose !"}
{"text":"After a long day, I decided to give it a shot as a pizza lover but I was very disappointed with it. The place itself is nice and has a cool vibe with the decor and lights etc but the pizza itself was such a waste. Yes, it's made from the wood fire oven but it was so burnt and you can't really taste anything but the dough being burnt. I had the Margherita pizza but didn't like it at all as it was not delicious! I was very bummed as I am such a pizza lover and they didn't meet my expectations! I won't probably go back."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and the Foodora delivery guy was very pleasant. The toppings, sauce, and crust were super fresh even though the pizza was delivered. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Montreal in order to have it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their pizzas!! The crust is delicious and all the toppings are so fresh. I especially love those little red peppers, I don't even know what they are called but, wow, so yumm!! Will definitely be coming here every time I'm in Montreal! Next time, I'm throwing an egg on it!"}
{"text":"This place claims to make authentic Neopolitan pizza,all customised to your tastes and specifications.You pick the pizza style you want and choose your toppings,all fresh and neatly laid out. I had the Marguerita,very tasty,but would have preferred a bit more fresh basil. The interior of the place looks like an unfinished warehouse,complete with exposed ventilation pipes. Tables look like something out of kiddy school; pressed wood with the pizza logos on them. Service timely,pizza piping hot and freshly made,prices reasonable. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The owner was about to close - walked in around 11:50 PM - and he hooked me and my three friends up with pizzas!!!   Pizza was great, staff was very nice, and it was a great experience. He even gave us a buy one get one coupon.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If I was reviewing just the employees and the environment, I would easily give 5 stars.   However, I do need to review the food and I have to admit I wasn't overly impressed with their pizza. It was too soft for my liking and it was finished and at my table so quickly, but maybe that was the issue. The toppings kind of slopped off my slices and I found their servings to be very small for the prices."}
{"text":"Although the idea of creating your own pizza is kind of out of my ideal place, I have to say that this place is worth the time and money. I customized my pizza and all the ingredients were tasty and fresh. Can't beat the wood burning oven and since I did not have lunch I decided to pig out and have a pasta dish as well: pasta with pesto, good but not excellent like the pizza; that explains the 4 starts review....."}
{"text":"La pizza nous a été livrée carbonisée, je dis bien carbonisée, donc totalement immangeable. De plus, la pâte était saturée d'eau, molle.  J'ai demandé comment on peut ne pas se rendre compte que la pâte est totalement noire carbone sur le coté cuisson, fin bref  J'appelle pour le leur dire, ils prétextent que les fours sont difficiles, donc mon attitude est compréhensive, je les excuse, par contre je demande si l'on peut nous remplacer la pizza  Réponse moui.., j'attends une heure trente, rappel, le serveur me dit qu'il va la faire lui-même, et la faire livrer, je rappelle et tombe sur une réceptionniste qui me dit que le serveur est parti (lui-même venant de me dire qu'il prenait son service à peine deux heures avant) et que je ferais mieux d'appeler un autre restaurant.  Carrément. avec le ton de ceux qui se fiche vraiment du monde.  Je suis verte, je rappelle illico et tombe sur le premier serveur: baratin c'estpamoi-c'estl'autre, que soi disant ils n'auraient pas le contrôle sur les livraisons .. blabla  En passant, je n'ai pas jamais entendu parler de livreurs qui ne livrent pas leurs commandes.   Je déconseille fortement cet endroit. Insolence, manque de respect, prennent les gens pour des truffes.  Ps bonne idée de 'déguster' leurs pizzas dans un parc, à coté des pigeons, et partager avec eux, mais les pigeons eux-mêmes n'en voudraient pas.  Et entre pigeons, on se comprend."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Brigade as it's not that far from my Montreal workplace and I had noted that it was highly rated on Yelp. Also,  I love pizza and neapolitan style in particular.   I just wish I had read the reviews before I went so I would have been more prepared and probably enjoyed it even more.  It is very casual first off and that's not just a comment on the decor and seating but the fact that you walk in and line up at a counter to make your order (and you stand in that line while all customers who are ahead of you get their pizzas prepared). I had a lot of bags and a laptop so this made it a bit uncomfortable frankly. There's nothing I would have loved more than to be able to sit and place my order. The other challenge is that it is difficult to see the menu when the counter area is busy and you are at the side of the counter close to the entrance. Their menu is not online either so it is hard to order when you are not sure of the options. I decided therefore to keep it simple and have a margherita. The service at the front was very friendly.  I asked for some extra basil leaves which they obliged but what I didn't realize was that those few extra leaves were 1.50 extra. That really surprised me. Overall the base price at 8.95 was really reasonable but I thought it was a bit petty to charge for extra herbs ( I learned later that it's 1.50 for each additional topping). So after I ordered and then paid it was a very short wait for the pizza. You take your pizza in hand, pick up your utensils from a side table and seat yourself. Luckily I had no trouble getting a seat and I tucked in right away. The pizza was a bit chewy which is not unexpected for that style of crust but it could have benefitted from maybe 20 seconds longer in the oven-it was just a tad underdone. Other than that, it tasted really good and it was the perfect size for one hungry person. For the pizza (with two additional toppings ) and a beer my total was $22."}
{"text":"A really cool concept with many toppings to choose from. The ambiance is 10/10 and honestly totally romantic; my boyfriend and I were totally digging it but he also went here with his mom previously so it's also good for hangouts and the like. Price wise, not too bad although they could offer better deals for more toppings as the price can quickly pile up once you add more. Overall, a sweet place you should definitely check out in the Golden Square Mile that looks understated from the outside."}
{"text":"I am disappointed , that we have 2016  and this pizzeria doesn't have gluten free pizza dough yet. That's a shame!   Mozarella basil tomato cheese arugula would be a kickass topping for a GF option! New York has it, Montreal should too!  Trust me! :)  Very nice staff! Pizza ok."}
{"text":"Delicious Napolitaine style pizza and quick and friendly service.  The salads are also excellent.  The pizza's are thin and delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered 10 pizzas for a work meeting. We needed the pizzas delivered early so I called a couple of days in advance to make the order and the guy was very helpful to make sure the order suits our needs and all the pizzas are delivered on time.  The pizzas taste very good, with fresh, varied, and high-quality ingredients, and there is a large choice of them, not to mention you can make your own ones, which means it was easy to get 10 different pizzas to suit everybody's taste. Some were a bit colder than others, but for the number of pizzas delivered I guess it is hard to have them all piping hot.  It would be nice to have a whole wheat dough option, and maybe the toppings could cover a bit more of the crust (the borders were a bit large on some pizzas), but overall these are great quality, good value pizzas."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised this place doesn't have higher ratings. The pizza was REALLY good, and very close to true Neapolitan pizza. Yes, we did have to wait in line for an extra couple minutes... it seems like the workers like to chit-chat a lot, but the taste of the pizza overshadows that. I got the Margherita pizza, and it didn't disappoint. They also serve Peroni there, which was a plus. The one thing I will say is that eat topping to add was an extra $1.50. To me, that's pretty expensive considering the pizza was already a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrid. I specifically asked for no meat on the salad and my friend ordered a side dish of meat and they mixed inti the salad. Inattentive and unprofessional staff"}
{"text":"Wood fired pizza ovens, hand-stretched dough, fresh toppings, fresh pasta, fresh mozzarella and house made cannolis make this place a big winner!!!   The pizza had a nice thin, bubbly crust with a good chew and a slightly smoky aroma from the wood fired oven. The toppings on our carne pizza were delicious, fresh mozza dotted the pie, the sauce a nice and light tomato flavour.  We also ordered 2 classic mini cannolis. Ahhhh, every crispy & creamy bite was pure perfection.   The food is fresh, good & honest. The staff were friendly and fun. The only downside was a bit of confusion at first as to whether we should seat ourselves, give our order to the pizza makers or order at the till. As well, the menu was in French only so we had to sit down and translate a few words on the phone for ingredients we weren't sure of. It was worth it! Yay for yummy pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Intéressant concept. Manger une pizza de la qualité servie en Italie mais a montreal. La pâte à pizza est coupée devant vous a votre arrivée, pétrie avec amour et prête à recevoir vos garnitures. Le menu est simple. Pizza ou sandwich. Il y a les pizzas classiques comme la Marguerita et les autres avec vos choix de condiments. Sauce béchamel ou sauce tomate? Les choix est infini. Une fois votre pizza préparée devant vous ,elle passera a peine 60 secondes de un four importé d'Italie à grand frais. Si vous la mangé sur place vous prenez vos ustensiles au comptoir et vous trouvé une place dans ce restaurant tout neuf mais moderne et décontracté.  Nous avons bu un bon Sangiovese pour accompagner notre repas. Si vous êtes au centre-ville , ne ratez pas l'occasion de goûter à leur excellente pizza a prix très raisonnable pour le centre ville."}
{"text":"Two & 1/2 stars. The smoky char from a wood fired oven couldn't overcome a way-too-watery tomato sauce that rendered the whole pie wet and floppy and well nigh impossible to eat without folding, lest every topping slide off into your lap. Pizza at its most essential is a consummate balance of crust, sauce and cheese.  Sauce needs to be robust, and a bit thick,  to be nicely offset by the other elements. Instead, the watery quality overwhelmed. Toppings (mushrooms, green olives and pink onion) were unremarkable. They serve wine and I had a nice glass."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is authentically Italian but it sure tasted like it! The ingredients are so fresh and mouthwatering that before you know it you will have eaten the whole thing in minutes!  You'll find yourself in an earthly heaven as you sink into that first bite and find your soul leaving your body!"}
{"text":"I love the fast-casual concept that Brigade offers, which was what initially drew me to this location when I was visiting Montréal over New Year's. In short, you walk in, choose your pizza dough, sauce, and toppings, and five minutes later it arrives fresh from the oven (or you could get a salad). There is also a small selection of beer on tap, because what goes better with pizza than beer?  I had a Caesar salad the first time I went and it was extremely satisfying to watch an entire head of Romaine get chopped up in front of me (I got a large). Shaving the parmigiano on top was a nice touch as well. The second time, JJ and I split the salad and I got a spicy meats pizza (diavola... or diablo?), which was delicious.  The second time we visited was New Year's Eve, and hardly anywhere near our hotel was open. But Brigade was open, so we were the first people inside, and we had a nice chat with the owner and employees while we were waiting for our food."}
{"text":"Nothing but love for these guys! Shout out to my boy Mustafa !  Love the nomz here super fresh always :)"}
{"text":"Found this place out of nowhere when my husband and i were both starving. On the outside it doesn't look like anything special, but as soon as you walk in you feel cozy and welcomed. We've tried a few of their pizzas so far and every single time we are having a foodgasm. The crust is perfect, the choice of toppings is great and the final results are outstanding. I highly recommend going there if you're craving real good oven baked pizza! The staff is also super friendly and they give good recommendations when we don't know what to pick!"}
{"text":"Walking through Montreal with a hungry and tired family, we happened upon Brigade and decide to go in because we were so exhausted and hungry.  All we expected was standard pizza and we got a whole lot more.  The pizzas are freshly made in front of your eyes, with whatever ingredients you want, then thrown into a brick oven for just 90 seconds.  We thought we'd have to wait awhile, but as soon as we sat with our drinks, the pizzas came right out.  And they were delicious!  Thin crust, just chewy enough, sauce not too sweet, fresh mozzarella and great toppings.  The pizzas were so good we ordered another one to go.  But the real surprise was the salad.  We had a rustic salad and not only was it huge, but super fresh, made before your eyes, with real mozzarella, large garlic cloves, soft and chewy sundried tomatoes, crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy croutons and a nice balsamic drizzle.  There were a few too many tomatoes for me, but I just pushed them aside and ate the rest of the salad with gusto.  I absolutely recommend Brigade for the pizza and the salad."}
{"text":"Great pizza but the staff is beyond disorganized so get ready for lots of waiting and mistakes. Firstly when you arrive there is zero sense of urgency to keep the line moving. I think this is a company culture thing since nobody working here seems motivated to get the customer on his / her way. Once you do manage to get your order in, there seems to always be a total communication breakdown between the people making the pizza, the person taking payment, and the people who are cooking the pizzas. Examples that I've observed the last three times I was there: pizzas that are for take out are being  plated for tables, pizzas that are to eat in are being boxed; they give you the wrong pizza; or they outright forget about a pizza (happened to me the last two times). Bottom line great pizza but needs a serious management system in place. Way too disorganized."}
{"text":"First time going here being from out of town. The toppings were great there was a lot on it, so much you could hold it and eat it like a pizza...but I'm not complaining I like picking some toppings off and eating it! I did the build your own pizza. However, the crust was a little too burnt to enjoy and super runny probably from the mushrooms and roasted tomatoes I had on there. They also don't do delivery, we called them cause Yelp said they did.   Overall it was okay, I liked the customized pizza, and it was quick service."}
{"text":"Although the tables around us were filled with dirty dishes and the staff were unprofessional (laughing, dancing, making jokes the whole time I was there), their pizza is pretty good. (If you're not a fan of thin crust, this isn't the place for you.)  It's unfortunate the quality of service doesn't match that of the food."}
{"text":"This my New favourite Pizza place in Town.  As you walk in. You notice the laid back atmosphere and cafeteria style dining. The Decor is simple but very nice in modern.   Now for the Food....  Getting in front of the prep station, you are greated by amazingly friendly staff. You get to choose from a really wide variety of toppings or you can pick a gourmet pizza/sandwich/salad already on the menu.   I obviously decided to go rogue and build my own.  And it was PERFECT.   So if you enjoy a no fuss atmosphere amd great Pizza. Definitely try this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Un mignon petit restaurant chaleureux au coeur de Montréal. Peu dispendieux : 11$ taxes incluses pour une pizza margharita avec saucisses de taille très raisonnable, cuite dans un authentique four à bois. Le service est impeccable : les employés sont super gentils et compétents. En attendant en ligne, nous avions droit à un réelle spectacle du maestro de la pâte à pizza, qui étendait rapidement les pâtes fraîches sous nos yeux ébahis. La déco est simple et conviviale et il a de grandes tables pour accueillir les groupes. C'est le genre d'endroit que je cherchais depuis longtemps !"}
{"text":"Went here again and took it to go since the place was closing. The pizzas were good and maybe even better than the first time I had it. I guess it depends what you put on it or how much oil they put but my pizza wasn't breaking apart completely this time so overall I think this is a solid pizza place in a really good location downtown."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went to this restaurant for a small lunch before leaving for the airport. We share a margarita pizza. Had very fresh ingredients. And was very quickly made. Staff was very friendly. Are our only complaint was that the dough used did not have much flavour for fresh. But everything else was great. It ended up being $20.00 for our pizza and two fountain drinks. Would go back for a light meal, but could see it getting expensive if a couple each ordered a pizza."}
{"text":"This pizzas are delicious. Wood ovens imported from Italy gives the pizza a unique taste. Cafeteria style line up where you can see all your fresh ingredients and pizza prepared in front of you. There are quality control employees who supervise the pizzas before and after cooking to maintain consistency. Definitely recommended for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"La Brigade is quite the institution among the interns at my office.   Their thin crust pizza is absolutely fantastic and they have an incredible breadth of options for toppings - who offers 2 types of mushrooms?!  You have the option to start off with margherita, marinara or a pesto base and can add toppings as you move down. They also have suggestions for you on their menu.   The pizza is really good - through the crust can be soggy quite quickly so eat fast!  The staff are nice and organized. They accidentally burnt our pizza and remade it for us before serving it - I feel like a lot of places might have tried to get away with serving it.   It's a pretty casual place and gets packed during the lunchtime office rush - but it' well worth a wait!"}
{"text":"The best pizza with fast, nice service and reasonable price in downtown. I like it very much, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here a lot (like almost once a week a lot). We love it however we find it to be inconsistent depending on who is there working making it. Sometimes it's amazing! There's one guy don't know his name :( but he's bald with a beard and he is amazing! Spins the dough perfect and spreads out the cheese well into smaller chunks, puts basil on without us asking (which we have to do a lot now) and nice and well done cooked.  However a lot of time we get subpar pizzas all soggy with like 3 blocks of cheese and then all sauce.  Make sure to ask for olive oil, basil, and a sprinkle of parmesan if they don't already put it (which I think should be standard they used to do this but not anymore)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Brigade, but recently they changed the bread they make their sandwiches with. Before it was on a nice roll; now, it's on pizza dough... Big downgrade! Please change it back to the way it was originally!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, crust has an Italian style, the ingredients are fresh, you can choose your ingredients. It's a great place for a date or just a casual super with some friends, totally recommend this place! Oh... and price is great too!"}
{"text":"J'ai beaucoup apprécié cette pizzeria située au centre ville près du metro peel. J'ai pris une pizza classique margarita (8,95$ plus taxes). On peut tout de suite juger une pizza en goûtant la classique et je n'ai pas été déçue, le goût de la sauce juste assez épicée, pas trop acide. La pâte délicieuse et pas trop fine. Le concept de ce restaurant est comme un subway, vous pouvez ajouter des ingrédients pour 1$ (tomates séchées, champignons, épinards....). Alors vous composez votre propre pizza pour pas très cher. Et elle sera prête très rapidement, la cuisson se fait en moins de 5 minutes!!! A essayer leur pizza au nutella ou les bouchées au nutella (4 batônnets fait à partir de pâte à pizza). A consommer sur place il y a assez d'espace pour les groupes et l'endroit est très sympa sinon à prendre pour emporter et déguster au parc, ce que j'ai fait :)"}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about Brigade and I'm very happy I finally gave it a try. They serve salads pizzas and they have beer available as well. This isn't a sit down  service type resto but that doesn't take away from the cozy comfortable ambience inside, clean and modern but woodsy and rustic at the same time. You order at the counter and then pick a seat and your food gets brought to you. You can select your pizza ,panini or salad from their menu or build your own. Our group ordered pizzas and one of us had a panini. We tried the margherita pizza and the funghi pizza both had perfect thin dough/crust (the dough on its own was tasty so with the toppings it was great!) not too heavy on the sauce or the toppings just the perfect balance- my favourite between the two was the margherita but both were very good. The panini was also very good , my friend tried the Rachel panini and really loved it. We then finished the meal by sharing their dessert pizza which was banana Nutella and English cream it was soooo sooo good and not too sweet or heavy but very satisfying. The prices are very fair and the quality of the food is there ! I don't believe there is any outdoor seating but plenty of space inside ! Also if you want to take home what you can't finish they have some self serve to go boxes you can take. I can see myself coming back here again !"}
{"text":"When you work downtown like I do the usual lunchtime food court fare gets boring pretty quickly.  That's why I'm always excited when I hear about a new restaurant opening up in this area.  Needless to say when I started to hear things about Brigade Pizzeria Napolitaine I knew I had to check it out.  Brigade Pizzeria Napolitaine makes Neapolitan-style pizzas fresh to order.  You can either start with a base and add whichever toppings you like or choose from one of their pizzas on the menu.  Since the crust is pretty thin it's best not to overload your pizza with toppings.  What had me so eager to try this place was the fact that they use a wood-burning oven to cook their pizzas.  Any restaurant that does this usually scores major points in my books.  That being said my sausage and pepper pizza was okay but nothing to write home about.  First off I asked for the crust to be well done and it was not.  They also put too much oil on the pizza so the crust got soggy.  It was lunchtime so there was quite a line-up of people who worked nearby.  That being said the staff are quite good at managing the crowds.  It did get a little crowded and confusing around where they give you your finished pizza but overall service was efficient.  For me the major downside is the price.  My pizza and a San Pellegrino clementina came to around $15.  Like I said my pizza was okay but the prices weren't justified if you ask me.  I would consider coming back in the future if I'm nearby but I won't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I've only ever had takeout pizza from Brigade, but it's a favourite spot of mine. Pizza crust is dense, soft, and chewy and has a fantastic smoky flavour from the wood-burning ovens. You can't really go wrong with any of the pizza choices here. At times the dough is almost paper thin in the middle of the pie, which sometimes leads to a collapsed pizza when sliced. Also, sometimes the edges are a little burnt, but overall the pizza is excellent and the gourmet toppings pretty generous."}
{"text":"I recently tried Brigade for the first time and very much enjoyed it. I went for lunch, the service was quick and the pizza really good.  I had the 4 cheese pizza and it was quite nice. My friend had the traditional margarita and also enjoyed it.  I'm going to good back when I'm in a mood for a good wood-oven pizza."}
{"text":"Concept sympa et simple (à la Subway/ on choisit ses condiments), pizza fraîche et délicieuse, cuite dans un four à bois en temps record de 2 minutes, ''attention'' les ''extras'' exemple, le bacon, olives ou encore les champignons sont chargé 1$, ça peut monter vite... Ma pizza Margherita à 7,45$ + 4,50$ d'extra était bonne. La déco est un peu funky. Y'a pas mal de tables, parfait pour les groupes. J'étais un des premiers clients vers les 11h30AM et le staff semblait enjoué et y'avait du gros gangster-rap/dance assez agressif comme musique en matinée.... Voilà, je pense y revenir si je désire une petite pizza frais fait. Bon appétit !"}
{"text":"So I wouldn't call it Neapolitan since I've never had  pizza this soft in Italy. It's the same kind of pizza that Bottega serves... Very soft, crêpe like.   That being said, their pizza is way better than Bottega, which is surprising considering Bottega is much more expensive. I tried the margherita and the sausage/peppers. Both were delicious. The sauce is perfectly fresh and the quality of the toppings is also very good.   I am only giving 3 stars because I like a bit of crunch on my dough. But that's just personal taste.    While my favorite pizza in town remains Pizzeria Napoletana on Dante, I still recommend this place if you feel like an affordable lunch and you're in the area."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed pizza guru, I was extremely excited to check out Stanley's latest wood oven pizza joint. To take it all in  Pros - Pizza made in front of you in little time - Huge selection of fresh & high-end ingredients - 4 Sauce options! - In attempts to differentiate from most dt pizza joints, the bottled beverages are organic juices and imported beers. The beer pairing (inn-something) was divine and I would highly recommend it - Nice decor & layout creates a great ambiance for groups or dates  Cons - Poor execution: my pizza was either greasy (pesto) or watery (thin marinara). I literally had to roll up each slice  Overall I had an okay pizza. Fancy ingredients and branding can't replace experience. Apart from the gentleman who manned the ovens, the staff lack rigid protocol to ensure each pie is up to brand standard. I would potentially go back, but would test the waters with very simple toppings."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this pizzeria twice and the service and quality just got worse for each time.   I have to say, the pizzas are one of the best I've eaten in Montreal, BUT only by taste. And that is also the only reason I ordered a second time from this restaurant. All the pizzas I've bought have had burned/black crust and bottom. The second time was the worst. Just by putting slices on a plate made my fingers look like I had held piece of coal. The second (and definitely the last) order took 2 hours to deliver, on a Tuesday! I called the restaurant to see what was going on with my order and the woman answering the phone lied to me and told me the order just had left the restaurant. I live in downtown, 10 minutes away by car. Still it took an additional hour for the pizzas to arrive - warm. To top it off one of the dishes was missing. You think the restaurant would mention that when you call them, but no, not this place.   Luckily I ordered through Just-Eat and they compensated me for the restaurants lousy service and quality.  So if you're looking for a great tasting pizza,  have all the time in the world and don't mind looking like you've been coal mining. This is the place."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I had the Fungi which was light , fresh, fast, and deliciously hot.  The staff were helpful and skilled at their work.  It is like the Chipotle of pizza.  The store is also has a nice Brooklyn 2.0 vibe."}
{"text":"I am crazy about pizza but felt this place fell very flat.  First if you wish to make your own pizza, it really adds up and I didn't pick out too many toppings. Also what I did not appreciate was the person making my pizza put very small amounts of the toppings.  I swear the gentleman making my pizza just wasn't into it and put tiny amount of veggies I wanted.  It was pretty disappointing and way too wet.  You're better off going with one of the options they have already come up with or you'll be surprised by the total if you do your own."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Brigade Pizzeria Napolitaine last night. It's by the same owner as Yeh! and I thought the idea of \"make your own pizza\" was really cool.  When I got there, the first thing that I saw was the 2 pretty awesome ovens, but the problem was that it was really hot in there and I can see that being a huge problem in the Summer.  The menu was short but also a bit confusing, I thought the point of the place was to create your own pizza, yet most of the menu had pizzas with toppings preset.  I got the margherita pizza base because I wanted to add toppings to it but when they made the pizza (flatten the dough, add olive oil, sauce, cheese, basil) they immediately gave me the order ticket without giving me the time or choice to add extra topping. I had to ask them to go back and add toppings and reprint my ticket. The other problem I found was that the pizza was only so big, after 2-3 toppings the entire surface gets filled and there is no point is adding more. My husband got the sausage and pepper pizza. He he wanted more toppings but gave up since anything else they added they would place only a tiny amount on.  When the pizzas were finally made, it sat on the table for about 5mins before one of the staff (the chef?) came around and put it into the oven.    While we were waiting for the pizzas to go into the oven, the staff didn't have anymore customers so they were walking around and one of them made a really loud comment to the other along the lines of \"There are so many fruit flies here.  They are always clustered on the salad toppings... I wish they would settle somewhere other than the salads (laugh)\" While the stafff said this, he was swatting his hand over the salad bar area and an army of fruit flies rose up.  This is definitely something that I don't want at any restaurant.  When the pizza made it out of the oven, one of the staff that made the pizza became the waiter and served us the pizza with cutlery. The guy was very nice, but I was confused, is this a sit down restaurant? I thought it was a fast food style place.  In terms of the taste, the crust tasted like naan bread (which was pretty good) but the pizza had way too much tomato sauce and not enough cheese. The pizza was also wait too thin, I usually like thin pizzas, but I can't even pick up a slice by the crust without it flop over and all the toppings/cheese falling off.  I can't say the pizza tasted bad, but it is definitely not good enough to match restaurant quality pizza and its not worth paying $15 per pizza at this place. I would not return to this place."}
{"text":"Very LA type of restaurant. Original concept and the ingredients are fresh (not always the case with \"built-your-own plate restaurants\"). I always recommend this place to pizza lovers (basically everyone)."}
{"text":"The crust/dough is the best part of the pizza. Pretty close to being Neapolitan style with the center nice and thin and the crust near burnt, slightly flaky, yet still chewy. The sauce I found to be kind of average. I got the Margherita and only got one tiny basil leaf and the cheese they used for it was mozzarella. I feel like it would have been super good had the cheese and the sauce been upgraded.   I also tried the Nutella banana pizza which was pretty great! They also offer desert calzones which I'll have to try sometime!   Pretty good in terms of price and convenience! They deliver and are located downtown!"}
{"text":"Tasteless pizza. My friend and I went randomly maybe three weeks ago, and they had no idea what they were doing. Ordered my pizza and customized it, the chef looked at me like I was crazy. Payed for the pizza ended up being more expensive than ordering in and more than one box of pizza. Ready to pay and the cashier couldn't \"print my bill\". Yes the pizza is freshly made, the toppings-they need to add more-extremely stingy with them actually. We were sitting next to another group of ppl and one of them was complaining about the same thing I have. Tasteless tasteless pizza. I get they are trying to be authentic, put please add some flavor to your tomato sauce sheesh."}
