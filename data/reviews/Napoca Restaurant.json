{"text":"My husband and I came here during a not-busy lunch hour. The service was good, though I suspect it would be good even if the place was full. The food was excellent and I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Quite tasty, very good service. Their Romanian specialties are delightful!"}
{"text":"Napoca offers a cozy and warm atmosphere with great service. Parking on the street is free on weekends, after 5:00pm or you could park at the public library, as Mircea mentioned.

Our table of 3 arrived on an early Saturday evening and were seated immediately. There was a large party of 25 that evening so the waitress gave us a more private spot in the corner, which was a nice gesture.

Big hits for the table included:

- Eggplant caviar:  smooth and flavourful served with warm, fresh ciabatta
- Warm goat cheese salad:  we enjoyed the nice thick layer of cheese, walnuts on the crostini

Not so much in love with the:

- Spicy calamari salad: the calamari was extremely chewy and only flavouring was from the over dosed chili flakes
- Bruschetta:  bread was too crispy for our liking.

Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. We sat and nibbled slowly, almost 3 hours and did not feel rushed to leave. We were hoping for dessert, but it turned out there was only one option - banana toffee, so we passed.

There are many places to choose from in Port Credit but we would definitely return to Napoca."}
{"text":"The food is great. The romanian wines are the bomb at least my wife tells me. Not too crowded (for now at least until more people will discover it). Free parking lot 150m west of it. Great protected patio. Very nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I have not reviewed anything in awhile, but I had to make a special point of commenting on yesterday's trip to Napoca Restaurant.  I went for a mid-afternoon lunch with a buddy.  I had never noticed the place before despite having driven by many times.  It is somewhat hidden from the street.  Their unusual specialty is Romanian cuisine which is referred to as Transylvanian Flavours on the menu.  Don't expect blood pie or anything ;-)  The ethnic dishes include MIcci (skinless sausages), Tripe Soup and Cabbage Rolls.  The menu had a bistro flair.

We were very impressed with the variety of menu items.  My friend had Napoca Chicken which was a chicken breast in a mushroom and mozzarella sauce.  He very much enjoyed it, but it was a bit salty for me.  I had the Warm Goat Cheese.  We both agreed that the goat cheese with walnuts and something sweet was to die for.  I was not expecting it to be so good.

We sat on their patio.  It is in a breezeway type space.  Don't expect a view.  Great outdoor location when other places are too cool and windy because it is well protected on three sides.  We also enjoyed the music which was playing at just the right volume.  We did not see inside.

Service was fine.  Out waiter was knowledgeable about the food and he was just the right amount of chatty.  My Pepsi was refreshed without asking, but a requested glass of water was forgotten.

The bill was quite reasonable, but check for yourself as they have their menu online with prices.

There are many restaurants and bars in Port Credit, but we will both keep the Napoca Restaurant in mind for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you are in a hurry as they make everything from scratch.  Perfect if you like to make substitutions or have allergies.  Menu has tons of selection and ambiance is great. Especially the patio in summer. Live music often. And great bevvies make it a nice hangout spot too."}
