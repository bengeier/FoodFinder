{"text":"Unfortunately gotta bring this down a bit. I came back to try more things on the menu and was a bit disappointed. Still great and super authentic. Their fish tacos are still numba one. But would not suggest their flautas. Also the tortillas were a bit old."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how much I adore this place. This is a cute, authentic, affordable, and super fantastic place, and I'm going to make it my mission to come here all the time. I'm never getting tacos from anywhere else. 

Here are some of the many reasons why I love and adore this adorable, tiny, amazing little place:

- On any given day, there's an advertised special on the sidewalk sign outside, so although it changes frequently it's always a fantastic value. One time there were $1.50 chicken tacos, and yesterday there was a $6.50 deal for three tacos and tea (and it's a special tea that I wish I'd asked about - kinda fruity, juice-like, super tasty).
- The owner is super nice and is more than happy to answer any questions you might have about menu items. Or even like if you want to close the door because it's drafty. 
- The tacos (normally $10 for three) come with a choice of different types of meat: chicken, basa fish, sirloin beef, beef tonge, fajita beef, pastor pork, ummmm, i don't remember the other kinds but they're all good. I tried them all and they're all really good. My favourite are the larger fish tacos that are normally $10 for two. 
- The tacos also come with two types of sauce: the green one is mild, the orange one is genuinely spicy and amazing and SERIOUSLY. It's legit. It's not white people spicy, it's amazing. 
- The quesadilla is also amazing and comes with another great (creamy, non spicy) sauce.
- Domestic and imported beers are $5-6, which is cool. My fav Mexican beer is Modelo, although when I was like \"can I get another beer please,\" on a casual Wednesday night, the lovely old owner was like, \"...another??\"
- The bathrooms downstairs are SUPER clean (probably because people don't use them very often I think?)
- But yeah, this place on the whole is fairly quiet (and small). The tables are small too -- meant for maybe 2 or 3 people but I'm sure you could push them together for larger groups. I think they do reservations for larger parties too if you wanted to book the whole space. 
- This is basically just an excellent date place as long as you're both down with chowing down in front of each other in a very well lit place. It's quiet and intimate and you can have conversations and stay for a while without getting chased out to make room for other customers. 
- If it ever does get busy (which I really hope it does, it really deserves all the business and praise), there's also some seating space at a cute little bar.

I've taken a ton of my friends here (one by one) and always had an amazing time, and everyone has loved it. For legit Mexican food, this place is seriously a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The tacos and guacamole were tasty! - better than some Mexican places I have eaten at and about half the price. Cute place to hang out, relaxed friendly service.  I'll go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great taco place!  Wonderful friendly staff, exceptional tacos (I just returned from Puerto Vallarta and these were similarly delicous). The prices?  Unbelievable.  We luckily stumbled upon this place by chance, and I can't wait to go back again.  Great little place you shouldn't miss!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS I EVER HAD. we ordered the fish tacos. they were delicious. we loved everything we ate. i think the owner served us and he was beyond hospitable. this is the type of place that you want to give your business to. i would go all the time if i didn't live so far."}
{"text":"Super friendly owner.  He took a lot of time to explain everything to us and even brought out all the beer to show us what they looked like.  He showed us a Mexican way to drink one of the beers with salt,  lime and chill sauce. 


The food was great too.  Very delicious and authentic.  The taco pita looked and tasted home made with top notch ingredients and a nice selection of different chillies/salsas with them as well.  A lot of different protein options for your tacos.  Overall great place!  Will definetly come back"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican! Had the tacos and a Negra Modelo. There with some friends and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money ...save yourself the money and buy a ton of corn beef and some tacos and make your own. Slow service and small portions"}
{"text":"You know a Mexican spot is boss when you walk in and feel like the biggest gringo in all the land. 

Here's that place. 

Small menu but oh boy do they do it well. 

First off, the mole, which is no an easy feat, ROCKED!

also they're tacos are all fabulous and flavourful. Their burritos might just be my favourite.

PS I am living proof that talking tequila at the bar is sure to win you brownie points. They have a good selection to nurse while you enjoy your succulent yummies. 

Drool drool drool all over the place."}
{"text":"Amazing little Mexican restaurant. Great prices and the food is fantastic. Be sure to try the michelada, best I've tried north of Mexico."}
{"text":"Underrated local joint with appropriately flavorful food. There's only 1 older woman running the food and two working in the back, so be patient with waiting a bit for her to get to you. I had the chicken, beef tongue and fish tacos. The fish came breaded fried and not grilled, but that was fine. The cow tongue was very tender and the fat was also very melt in your mouth, not tough at all. The place is also quite clean. At 3 for $10, the tacos are really affordable for the location"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food - though to be frankly honest, this was my first try eating authentically Mexican food not associated with any chain. The server was very friendly and cute, and upon entering the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was that everyone there spoke Spanish! We stook out like a sore thumb.

My sister had crazy cravings for burritos, and so she ordered their burrito ($10). While she didn't have any choices for fillings, she was able to choose the protein choice and ultimately selected the beef fajita (flank steak). A massive brick sized, densely stuffed burrito soon arrived. It was filled with seasoned rice (omg the rice was so good by itself - I believe it had been cooked in some broth and so was unbelievably flavourful and umami), refried beans, fatty and crispy seared flank steak, cabbage, corns, tomatoes, etc. It was then topped with sour cream. The burrito was really filling but so delicious! My sister was stuffed by the end of it but couldn't help herself spooning lots in her mouth.

I was really craving soup, and was torn between the consome (lamb with chickpea soup) and pozole (a red pork soup with hominy). In the end, the server recommended pozole, and so I ordered that (even though it was a solid $5 more expensive). The soup came filled to the brim with pork, and some chicken, as well as hominy. It was my first time eating hominy, and found its dense mushy texture to be very interesting. Before I seasoned the soup with any of the provided garnishes, I found the soup to strongly resemble a Chinese pork and bean soup that we make often. 

The pozole came with limes, radishes, onions, spicy red peppers, some thyme bits, tortilla chips, and a green salsa verde. After adding the lime, onions, and salsa, the soup's flavours were all accentuated and enriched. It was absolutely delicious! I only wish that there were less hominies and more broth...

Overall, a very satisfying and deliciously authentic Mexican meal! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our group did not want to wait 2 hours in the cold for La Carnita, so we ended up yelping and walking over to this place which was less than a block away. There was no line and they had space for our group of ten. They had a $2.50 fish taco special, so we thought we would try it out. Being a bit skeptical, we all ordered only one fish taco each, but after eating it, we were all very pleasantly surprised. We decided to order several more fish tacos. The fish was fried well and the taco had a good assortment of other ingredients including a feta-like cheese. It takes about 4 - 5 tacos to get adequately full, but for the price/value, there are not many other Mexican places that could beat it. Definitely coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"ok, I don't think this place is called La Loteria anymore because they didn't have a sign nor was the menu called La Loteria, it was called Hacienda OR I am just a complete idiot and went to the wrong place BUT I did double check the address and it was correct (I think).

Anyway, came by Friday and lucky me, $2.50 fish tacos. Hell. Fucking. Yes. Got two of those and a nachos. The nachos ($6) was not what I expected. It was so loaded with goodness (tomatoes, feta cheese, drizzles sour cream, green onions, beans) and it was very filling (there was two of us). We also got two fish tacos which was also very loaded (cabbage, tomatoes, sauce, cilantro) and very delicious. The shape of the fried fish was a little questionable though - it was rectangular (no, I am not shitting you).

Our bill came up to $15 with tax and tips. Seriously, why would anyone go anywhere else? We got dinner for $7.50 each. Bomb. And yes, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my Mexican go-to.  The tacos are always amazing, fresh and flavourful and delicious.  I love the soft corn tortillas, that have an authentic taste that I've rarely had outside of Mexico. You also literally cannot beat the price - $1.50 special tacos (even eating 3-5 tacos, that's a cheap dinner).  The service has always been great, too!  In the summer, they also open up the front of the restaurant so you can watch all of the college street activity.  It can sometimes be quite quiet inside, so don't be alarmed if you are the only one in the restaurant (or one of the only ones).  You're just one of the few who is taking advantage of a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it was a let down. We tried the tacos, and the carnitas had a very odd flavour... almost rancid. I grew up in latin america, and I've had authentic Mexican food. I'm not sure what was up with that taco. Maybe it was just an off day, since the other reviews are glowing. It's concerning that they'd serve up the rancid pork like that though."}
{"text":"I don't care what they call this place, it's like a home away from home (if I were Mexican I suppose). Their tacos have that hominess that I crave when I go out but couldn't possibly make them this good myself. This restau used to have a slightly different paint job and was called La Loteria. I did ask about the transformation but I didn't totally understand the answer for the re-badging of the restaurant. They still have the sign out front saying $2.50 for chicken tacos. We tried those, plus chorizo (not greasy and full of flavour), and as well the baja fish. All very good! And the guacamole was fantastic too. Their BBQ sauce was smoky and delicious as was the spicy green sauce to go with your chips. If you feel like you've just walked into your Mexican relative's dining room, you will have had my experience with Hacienda, olé!

ps. The last time I was here eating, when paying I inadvertently walked out with the owner's iphone, thinking it was mine - at the bar. I was halfway down the block when I realized I had two phones and walked back to return it. We had a good laugh."}
{"text":"I'm very much impressed with their customer service. Also i would like say about online delivery. It was just amazing delivery when i was ordered on my birthday party..!!

Definitely i will use them again and again.!"}
{"text":"Great portions, nice service and delicious guacamole!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Colorado and have been pretty let down by Toronto's Tex-mex burrito joints, I wish I'd known about this place for months!

Came in 30 minutes before close, they're happy to serve us, fortunately! 

Awesome nachos, large basket and with fresh lettuce and pico de gallo. Could be a meals for $6 or a great size for 2-5 to share as an app.

We got tacos, authentic style, generous portions. Chicken was... chicken. But carnitas were nicely spiced, so good!

Simple menu, simple prices great food--just wasn't sure on the service style... ended up walking up to the bar to order and pay, trying to respect their time."}
{"text":"Tasty and well-priced Mexican food. Restaurant is simply laid out, service is decent, and the menu is simple. The ambiance feels authentic to a restaurant in Mexico with Mexican music videos playing on a tv screen. One critique is that the menu is quite meat heavy and you have to ask for vegetarian options, which there are only a few. The guacamole is a must-have! I ordered tacos (2 veggie and 1 fish) and they were overall yummy except I found the batter on the fish a little thick. You also get two complementary spicy sauces - a green and a brown one. The brown spicier than the green, so be aware. Overall, an authentic Mexican restaurant with good prices!"}
{"text":"Best taco deal in the city. Al pastor tacos for 1.50 is class. The owner is also a pleasure to deal with. 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Used to work in the area and NEVER even knew this place existed. Was a bit weird being the only Asian in this establishment, nobody really seemed to mind. I LOVE the owner, he is such a sweetheart! As we were leaving, he was holding onto an infant and just pacing the floor to put the baby to rest. While walking out, we kept turning back to wave to the gentleman and he kept waving back at us! I have now found my go-to taco place! You could just feel the sense of family in this place. The food was fresh, it was wholesome, it was delicious. My only regret is I didn't discover this when I was a student on a budget. Hell, let's be honest,I'm still on a budget."}
{"text":"Wow, so impressed with the tacos I had here. Just came back from Tulum, Mexico and these tacos are probably some of the most authentic you'll get in the city. Really so flavourful. The carnitas was soft and had some crispy bits. All in all, so delicious and I can't wait to bring all my friends. So reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"This place is now called Hacienda Los Americas. It's the same staff and management but they've changed the name, at least that's what I understood. But whatever the name of the place, the tacos are corn only and delicious and authentic Mexican. I tried a few of them and the best were the beef sirloin and suadero. Tastes very Mexican and not like the various other Tex-Mex places. Their hot sauce is so good and so hot! The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a completely authentic Mexican experience, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most underrated taco joints in the city. Strange how this place is located on a pretty prime part of the city yet it's so easy to pass right by without even noticing it. Probably has something to do with the atrocious decor or there-lack-of. Anyhow, this review is more about the food.

Homey is what best describes this place. This feels like a joint run by a Mexican family cooking up some very homey meals. Their tacos, nachos....etc all have a made-at-home kind of feel to it. No fancy plating and unnecessary garnishes. Just straight to the point, flavourful and delicious stuff. The best part is the prices are pretty cheap when compared to other taco places in the city. Value aside, it's their no-frills, un-adulterated way of preparing the food that separates them from the rest of the other taco places in the city. Meats are well seasoned and nicely caramelized, veggies are on point and the proportions of the components are almost perfectly done. There's no spilling of meat and veggies as you bite into the tacos with sauces squirting out in every direction. It seems as though it was very well thought out and eating their tacos doesn't require a bib like most places do.

The tacos here remind me of the many fantastic taco stands I had out in the west coast (LA) run by hard working Mexican families using home-made recipes. If ever I am craving tacos this is definitely my go-to in the city."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was lovely. I chose the tacos (3 for $10) and you can mix and match whichever meat you want. There are also daily specials that get you the same deal for $7.50 (today it was the fish taco). Along with this, you get two very tasty salsas (the red is fiery and the green just adds a pleasant kick). They also have a great selection of jarritos (grapefruit is my favourite) and yummy guacamole! 

One of the best parts about this place is the owner, who so nicely answered our questions about the menu and made us feel right at home. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food on College! Very unassuming decor and frontage, we nearly missed it the first time around. It's great for casual no frills Mexican food, and everything there is done pretty and old school (they take debit/credit, but they still write down your receipt old school). 

We tried the guacamole, 3 tacos, and the enchiladas. Guacamole had a good kick of lime in it, and the two salsas that it came with it were nice and brought lots of heat! Tacos were delicious, they use soft shell corn tortillas. We tried the pastor, beef sirloin, and beef tongue - my favourite was the pastor because it was more flavorful and had little chunks of pineapple in it. Enchiladas were soft and cheesy but definitely also had a lot of heat to it! 

Water is served in empty tequila bottles!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this place after trying to get a seat at Sneaky Dees across the street. What was initially a backup choice ended up being one of our best meals out in a long while.

We ordered the chips and guacamole, as well as a mix of tacos (chicken, pastor, and chorizo). 
Chips and guacamole a generally fail-safe choice anywhere, but these were above our expectations. Both were clearly homemade. The guacamole had just the right amount of seasoning and lime juice for bite, and the chips were thick, super-crispy, and ever-so-lightly salted. 

Then came the tacos which were easily the best and most authentic we've had in the city. Each came over a perfectly grilled corn tortilla and topped with the traditional onions and cilantro you find at taquerias all throughout Mexico. While all three types were delicious, the chorizo was the true star. The blend of seasonings in the meat was phenomenal. There was even a slight hint of allspice in there; a surprise but it worked phenomenally.

The lovely owner also brought out two phenomenal homemade spicy salsas: one kicked-up salsa verde, and a red insanely-spicy-yet-delicious tomato/chili/onion-based salsa. While both were great, the red was the clear winner despite setting our mouths on fire. 

We'll definitely be back our next time in the area."}
{"text":"Every now and then you come upon a place that does things in an authentic way at a reasonable price. This is it.

Come to Hacienda for great tacos that are freshly prepared and inexpensive. The place is no frills, yet if you simply want a satisfying lunch you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My top tacos place in Toronto now!  After having some killer authentic tacos in Chicago I've been lamenting my inability to find the same flavor closer to home. Hacienda las Americas has now saved the day!

You know that the food is gonna be good when you are served water in a Tequila bottle and even better that the fish tacos were on special that night! We got baja fish, al pastor, carnitas and beef tacos. Each was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor. Basically you can do no wrong whatever you choose.

We warned that the place isn't fancy or upscale, more a local tacos joint that the neighborhood seems to hang out at. At one point some water started dripping onto our table from above. We weren't even phased, just switched tables and kept eating (they were that good)."}
{"text":"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican restaurant there is in the downtown area. They are well priced, and have amazing portions. It is insulting that la carnita sits across from them and claims to serve 'Mexican foods'. Enchiladas and pork tacos are my favourite dishes. You can't go wrong by supporting a family owned and operated, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried their fish tacos and they were amazing! Had all the right tastes. We came in for a small bite before a dinner reservation because we have to try tacos where we see them. The owner is very nice! Go here!"}
{"text":"HLA is one of my favourite spots in town - and certainly has some of the best Mexican food in the city. 

Mexican food in Toronto is mostly relegated to tacos, and burritos, but HLA does much, much more (in addition to these). That said, don't miss the beef tongue tacos!

I often crave the flavour of Mexican soups and sauces, and nobody fulfills that craving more than HLA. 

I cannot say enough about this place. Just make sure to check it out!!"}
{"text":"The nachos were delicious and fresh! We ordered 2 of the fish tacos, a beef tongue, chicken, and a chorizo taco. The chicken was the least favorite, but still very tasty! The (I'm assuming) owner served us and was very polite. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Damn son...we took a gamble at La Loteria and man did we win or what!  From outside it kind of looks like a dive.  The sign outside saying $2.50 fish tacos didn't really help their cause either but we figured what the hell.  Inside the place is quaintly decorated.  We were there midday and the owner had at least 3 or 4 generations of family chowing down.  The service was excellent.  Our server, who coincidentally was the owner, was caring and attentive. He took the time to explain everything that was in our items including his specialty cocktail which was a hybrid caesar using beer instead of vodka in a massive hoegarden glass (you know the one).  The guac was smooth and creamy, the nachos were fresh and the fish tacos were great.  They may be smaller than the competition but what they lack in size they make up for in quality!   Now, if they could only give me the winning LottoMax numbers..."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot, the actual look of the restaurant is kind of disappointing, lots of graffiti on the outside, but looking past that, la comida... que ricoooo!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food as it did not correlate with the high ratings on yelp. I ordered chicken with rice and beans and it was quite bad. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I have been to in the GTA. I was the first to arrive from a party of 4, and was greeted by friendly staff. Despite waiting quite some time for my friends to trickle their way in, the servers were kind and always kept my glass full. 

Since the appetizers and mains were relatively affordable, we opted to try as many dishes as our stomachs can handle, without the worry of emptying our wallets. We had the guacamole and nachos to start, and boy was that a wonderful start to a feast. The tri-coloured nachos were succulently crunchy, topped with a prized amount of ground beef, sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and other ingredients. The creamy guacamole was complimented with smoking hot tortilla chips, an indication that it was made fresh and in-house. On the side were two types of sauces that I do not know the name of, but the orange sauce was more spicy than the Extra-hot Peri Peri Sauce from Nandos! I must have been a daredevil to smother that on my chips.

The mains we ordered were the stuffed quesadillas, fish tacos (half off on Fridays), carne asada and emmoladas. My favourite has got to the be the fish tacos and emmoladas. The fillets were fried, yet maintains a subtle scent of the sea. Topped with a generous douse of lime juice, the flavours came alive. The emmoladas, corn tortillas rolled around chicken breast and covered with a chili pepper sauce, were equally tasty. The strength in this dish lie in the perfect meld of chocolate and beans. I claim to be no expert in food tasting, but the unique and bizarre combination here works wonders. 

It is unfortunate I failed to discover this place having resided in the area for 2 years. I highly recommend those with a craze for Mexican food to let Haciendas cater to your delight."}
{"text":"Decent tacos. It's was busy so the service was ok but I was not impressed.I would have hoped for larger qty for the price. I was happy to try but I will go to Chipotle next for the price /qty"}
{"text":"I plan to add a more detailed review later on, but let me just say that this place is legit. As soon as I walked I was like \"yes, this is real Mexican\" and it did not disappoint. Pretty limited menu so you can probably try everything in just a few visits. We went two weeks in a row it was so good and will definitely be going back. Fish tacos were excellent as a snack to fill up. Service and atmosphere also great. Decor is a little dated but that's part of what makes it feel so authentic! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem hidden in plain sight. We recently moved a couple blocks away and decided to try it based on all the good reviews.

We had some tortilla chips and guac; tacos and a burrito. Their guacamole is excellent: it has a slightly chunky, rustic texture, and just the right amount of lime and seasoning. Chips didn't appear homemade but were a cut above your standard store-bought.

My wife had three tacos: 1 chorizo, 1 al pastor, and 1 fried fish. She raved about the fish taco and also enjoyed the other two. I tried a bite of the al pastor, and it was pretty good, although I have a high bar for al pastor. (Tacos 101 has the best al pastor in Toronto, by far.) All three came in slightly crispy corn tortillas.

Meanwhile, I had a chorizo burrito. It was delicious -- mostly meat and creamy rice, with not much \"filler\" -- but very messy, as it showed up on the plate cut in half and drizzed with crema. (It also doesn't help that chorizo is by nature very oily.) I inhaled the burrito with the help of about 15 napkins to clean myself up. It was possibly the best burrito I've had in Toronto.

I will definitely be coming back to try more of the extensive menu, which includes moles, enchiladas, pozole and even menudo (!).

I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars. For now I am giving 4 as, despite the excellence of the burrito here, I give Tacos 101 the edge on both tacos and tortilla chips."}
{"text":"In my search for real tacos in Toronto, this place makes me tear up in nostalgia for hole-in-the-wall taquerias in Mexican neighbourhoods in California. They have a daily deal with one type of taco at a cheaper price per taco which makes it California taco pricing, too. Be still my heart.
When we went, it was close to closing time and the family was all sitting at a long table and eating together. Service was slower, but it was a great homey atmosphere and I felt good supporting them. Plus the tacos were great, the meat was cooked perfectly, the salsas were fresh and spicy, and the beer was cold. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5, awesome tacos
Service: 5/5, super nice family owner
Price: 15/person

I went to this place with my friends. This is a small and cozy restaurant. The owner is so sweet. They are welcoming and polite. I am not a huge taco fan, but I like the tacos here, it has so much favours. We both chose the 3 taco for $10. It was a pretty good deal. It came with hot and bbq sauce on the side. Every bite, there was so much going on in my mouth. I like this place."}
