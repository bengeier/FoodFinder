{"text":"Feeling hungry while walking along the strip? This is best place to go get your snacks & meal. They serve you delicious steak, seafood , or both in a togo cup with fries and veggies! Oh it also comes with DRINK ON THE BOTTOM! Easy to carry and eat, you can trash cup and fork cuz they are disposable 

I would definitely go get some again when I go back to vegas."}
{"text":"Very friendly host/owner and the food was delicious. Very innovative way of serving food. I had the shrimp and salmon with rice. The whole thing comes in a soda cup with your choice of soda and a bowl with the food and forms the lid for for the soda cup. It was fun and delicious . Definitely a place I would recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, awesome food, innovative concept for walking the strip. Once they get the alcohol approval it's going to be lit! Heat travels up, coldness travels down, and this concept works out"}
{"text":"I visited chew and chug recently. While I was here the staff was very attentive and they provided great service. The concept was convenient for walking around. The shrimp was sweet and tangy. It was great quality food. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Chew and Chug is easily one of the best and most unique experiences I've had in my recent visit to LV!

The delightful staff greeted me with a friendly smile and helped me through the mouthwatering choices. I decided to get the Surf N Turf with tenderloin and shrimp on top of rice, mixed veggies, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. It was served very aesthetically in a clever yellow bowl that fits snug on top of a big fountain drink. 

The proteins were perfectly seasoned and just melts in your mouth. The veggies were grilled just right and balances out the main stars of the dish. And ofcourse, the onion rings and mozzarella sticks highlighted the meal with all their golden fried goodness. I can't wait to come back to try the other combinations, especially with beer as a future option. I have high hopes for this business and wish to see them expand closer to home. 

Overall 10/10 excellent quality food, creative and convenient presentation, hard working and helpful staff. Perfect for Instagram!!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept for food and drink on the go! 

The menu at Chew and Chug is very simple. You start by picking a base, either fries or fried rice. Then move onto the proteins, Tenderloin or Ribeye from the land, and Scallops, Salmon and Shrimp from the Sea. Lastly, you pick a fountain drink, sweet tea, lemonade or beer (coming soon). If you want additional items, you can add onion rings, mozzarella sticks or even grilled veggies. I loved the garlic shrimp a lot, it's very flavorful. 

They're currently having a grand opening deal so it's about $10 for a cup. Very convenient and great if you're walking around the strip looking for a quick bite. 

Would definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Sin City!"}
{"text":"There food is awesome.the employees are wonderful and respectful. Everything they prepare is beautiful and fancy but also tasteful and fulfilling.if I could eat there daily I would lol. And also the wait is not long they freshly prepare your food as soon as you order perfect I give 5 stars. And would recommend people to eat there."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place when I walked nearby because it smelled so good and it was the best decision ever! They have good food and the staffs are very friendly. I ordered salmon steak and it was really fresh. It came out with a cheese stick, onion rings, and some veggies and you can choose the drink on the bottom! Also, it was very convenient because you could hold both of your food and drink owith one hand. Perfect food while walking down on the strip! I definitely would visit this place again when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend eating here. The food is great and the concept is so neat! I've tried the steak with onion rings. The steak was perfectly cooked. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Perfect food for the strip! Super convenient to just carry around the strip on one hand, not to mention the bomb quality of the food. The staff was very friendly as well. I got sweet chilli shrimp and it was amazing  definitely would recommend to anyone visiting the strip!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while walking around the strip and it seemed very convenient to have all your food in one hand so I could use my other to hold my phone up to my face, because I'm a millennial, and that's what we do. If you're not a millennial, it's still a great way to have your food+soda in one hand and a Fat Tuesday in the other - hey, it's Vegas.

I ordered the shrimp with garlic butter and either the tenderloin or filet mignon. It came with fried rice, onion rings, mozzarella sticks, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and red bell pepper strips. I immediately took out the red pepper strips and placed them in the garbage where they belong (apparently everyone loves them except me). Everything else was so flavorful though, especially the main foods - the steak was tender and the shrimp was so moist (I know, disgusting word, but it really was). The portion size is huge as well, even though it all fits into the bowl that sits atop the soda.

The service was great and the cashier was so friendly and patient with my disgustingly drunk friends (I was sober, responsible, and mature). I would definitely come back here the next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This was a great find. Had the steaks and scallops and it was cooked perfectly. They took out the rice and added veggies and a fried egg because I trying to stay away from carbs. Would definitely recommend for a quick snack when on the strip"}
{"text":"So you're a hungry tourist and walking down the strip when you reach the Hawaiian Marketplace. There's still the second half of the strip to walk and it's hot as fun outside, but you need to eat. 

Chew & Chug is an outdoor counter with a small seating area up front. Their concept is serving meals for mobility. It's a large drink of soda or juice with a bowl of food on top, surrounding your straw. Drink in one hand, fork in the other.

First, you choose your protein: tenderloin steak, galbi beef, shrimp, scallops, salmon, or do a surf and turf mix like I did - galbi (medium) with shrimp garlic butter (or sweet spice). Follow that with your choice of base: rice or fries. With each order, you get veggies like bellpeppers, asparagus, tomatoes, broccoli, and fried onions!

So you can see, this is quite a big meal and it all fits in your hands. I like that its flavor was like it came off a backyard bbq grill. What I didn't like so much was it was 6pm, still hot as fun outside with no fans or mist, and it took about 10 long minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"I LOVED the quality of the Sweet Chili Shrimp Those shrimps and fruits were really fresh and I would go again!!! Highly recommended I already ordered another one hehe"}
