{"text":"I love this place so much. The staff are always super friendly and helpful and the menu is constantly being updated with new delicious vegan options. My favourite go-to is the tuna-less salad, but the eggless egg salad comes in at a close second. Will keep coming back until I've tried everything! Always a pleasure coming to YamChops."}
{"text":"The Szechuan \"beef\" is my favorite. You are able to sample items behind the counter just to make sure you will like what you get, but I think you will love all of it. Some items are priced by weight. The store is a bit expensive for what you get. If you are not a fan of the faux meats, there are premade salads available to purchase."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I loved the huge selection of vegan foods, the service was super friendly and I ended up buying much more than I had budgeted for. But that's totally fine, the black bean brownies are to die for.
The only disadvantage I can see is that they close at 7 on weekdays and I can hardly make it there in time after work. Hope they will open a new branch more in the East of Toronto."}
{"text":"I would have rated this place 5 stars, if only it weren't for the steep prices for the deli items. Had the Mongolian 'beef', Korean BBQ 'chicken', butter 'chicken' and tuna-less salad. They were all very yummy, but my tiny container of the butter chicken cost over $6! Guess this should be a treat...

Their freezer section has the fish-less filets by Gardein (hard to find in Toronto). They also carry tea popsicles, which I do want to try at some point.

The staff is very friendly. I'll be coming back...on payday!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. I am trying to become vegetarian and this is the perfect place to start. The food was delicious and even better than real meat!!!  I will 100% be back several times a week. 

I hope to see more places like this open up in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We had YamChops cater an event for us and we couldn't have been happier with the service. Michael and Jess are so professional, competent, and experienced with catering that it was an absolute pleasure to work with them. The meat-free appetizers we ordered included an Indonesian spiced tofu with mango salsa, Cashew-chickpea hummus wrap with carrot, lettuce and mango tamarind chutney, Fiesta Potato Coins w Cashew Cream, Chipotle Salsa and Walnut Taco \"Meat\" and the most delicious Cayenne and Chocolate cookies for dessert! Absolutely Delicious! I also had the BBQ Apple Juice - which tasted amazing despite containing charcoal (an extremely effective detoxify-er!). Definitely recommend YamChops as a meat free catering option!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian. I am a bonafide meat eater. I like trying new things all the time and when I passed by this place the name made me chuckle so I said why not, let's try it out.

The service is absolutely impeccable. I know nothing about vegetarian or vegan meals and I was given an entertaining and informative quick couple of lessons on the various items. But when they let me try the cold press juices they made, I was blown off the map. How does a person go back to Tropicana or Minute Maid after drinking these?

As for the food I had the Szechuan beef, creamy roasted potato salad, and the no crab crab cakes. Holy s*&^% I was shocked at how good this food tasted. The potato salad just blew my tastebuds away while the beef texture was very close to actual beef while its flavour just had my tongue slow rolling to have it stay around as long as possible.

Washed it down with a juice called El Greengo which not only tasted like what is must be like to ride a unicorn down a rainbow but I noticed a surprising amount of energy throughout the rest of the day. 

Am I going to give up meat anytime in my life? No but when you want healthy and tasty vegetarian food or want to try something you never tried before these guys deliver the goods."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by the sincere, warm service. After being invited to sample several of the delicious deli options, we opted for a Korean BBQ Chick*n Wrap and Chick*n Shawarma Wrap. The Korean BBQ Chick*n Wrap was particularly spicy and flavourful.

I really appreciate that YamChops prepares its own seitan. Now that Field Roast sausages are no longer available in Canada, I gather that YamChops plans to offer its own vegan seitan sausages soon, which is exciting. It would be great to see YamChops offer reusable or compostable cutlery and containers (e.g. the Tiffin Project).

YamChops' prices are what one would expect for an independent local business offering high-quality niche products. Its foods would likely be a special treat rather a regular staple for most folks (me included). It offers fun, delicious and inventive foods for those who are plant-based or veg-curious in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm on mobile so I'll keep it brief.

The food is delicious - really great flavor.

For a nearly 12$ wrap, i expect something bigger than a McDonald's snack wrap. I'm not exaggerating. The smallest wrap shell loosely wraps around meagre lettuce and carrot, and two very thin strips of Buffalo fried chicken. Delicious, but gone in a few mouthfuls. Since I'm very sure they don't use exclusively organic, how is that OK?

Might be worth buying deli stuff as a test, but i would stay away from their stingy prepared foods."}
{"text":"great food great service clean store. the only problem i have with this place is that it hasn't moved to Vancouver. i highly recommend the bean burgers and the ribs. next time i am in Toronto i will be back."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided to do a vegan bakery crawl in August, not long after Yamchops opened, and we decided that even though technically not a bakery, we all wanted to stop in here. None of us had ever been and we were very happy with what we found. They had what we were expecting in terms of options for food: the beet burgers, un-tuna salad, coconut ba-con, etc. but what made the experience special was the service and friendly staff. They insisted on giving us samples of almost all their prepared foods and then when we sat down to eat the lunches we purchased they came over with a gift of a chocolate cream pie in a mason jar and 5 tiny spoons. We will definitely be back. Thanks, Yamchops!"}
{"text":"I have yet to try their food but I've heard amazing things. I did their 5 day juice cleanse and I give that 5 5 stars in itself. The juice was delicious,  especially the bbq apple pie. During the cleanse all my senses came back alive, I felt so much good energy and the world was just brighter and felt better to be in. For those without the time or discipline to make 6 juices a day go your juice cleanse through them! So highly recommended"}
{"text":"Yamchops is a cool concept, I have been to the store and also used their delivery service. I love all of the cold press juices I have tried so far: el greengo, dirty dancing, yamchops and the beach. I'm excited to try them all! Maybe a juice cleanse is next?"}
{"text":"I went to check them out after seeing then on Dragon's Den and it's a nice place. I bought the Szechuan Beef, No Crab Crab Cakes & another Chicken dish with cashew etc. I ordered it for a party and the Seechuan Beef was an absolute hit followed by the Chicken one. I felt the Crab Cakes lacked seasoning. The service was great and they were patient with us trying to figure out our likes and dislikes. The only thing that I have as a negative is the price. I understand these are unique speciality items but I cannot be a regular. These have to be one off luxuries that you enjoy once in a while. Nevertheless try them out!"}
{"text":"This is the first of its kind ladies and gentlemen. Before you criticize the novelty aspect of this place, consider actually going in and eating all the phenomenal creations they make from scratch. Absolutely delicious, and this is coming from a non vegetarian. Also, pretty decent prices for such healthy and wholesome food. Another bonus is that the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, ready to answer all the questions you have, even if you're a meat eating skeptic. Love it."}
{"text":"I had an amazing lunch at Yam Chops! This is the perfect place for a vegetarian/vegan meal. The CBLT and Kale Caesar were delicious and I received excellent customer service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but by some reasons I have to do it today. The food is okay. Not so good but not bad. The staffs are super friendly and nice. That's why I rate it 4 stars. The price is a bit expensive than I thought with a little wrap."}
{"text":"Lots of great vegan cheeses, meats, sandwiches, and other products. Highly recommend the bleu cheese, cranberry & nut cheese, and the ribs."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to live just a short walk from YamChops and I frequent this place often.  The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable, and allow you to sample everything before purchasing.  They also have food demos from their vendors often which is a great time to sample further.

The deli counter boasts a huge array of faux 'meats' (all non-GMO products) which are prepared in a way that are super flavourful and can easily please omnivores or those just transitioning to veganism.  I'm a big fan of the pulled 'pork' to top nachos or the Korean or miso 'chicken' for wraps (which are much more afordable to make at home).  Yes, it can seen a little pricey, but how much do people spend on meat and what's the true 'cost'?

Their yam burgers are delicious and the macaroni salad is to die for.   I'd recommend strolling a little further back to the fridges where they stock delicious local falafel balls (the Chipotle ones are a staple in my fridge) and amazing cashew cheeses.  The also have their own brand of Caesar salad dressing which is incredible, as well as a great variety of vegenaise.

I tend to stay away from the frozen fare and snacks, but there are countless options for everyone here.  My husband is a meat eater and loves all their deli products.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying everyone working there is really nice and I wish them the best success. I felt very welcomed, they were all very helpful, and it's the type of staff you hope to see in a customer service business.

-----------------------

The Positive: As aforementioned the staff is wonderful. The store is clean and well kept. Many shelf items are tough to find (even in Toronto) and reasonably priced. It's not a huge selection, but as a small specialty green grocer it works. The juices are also good, maybe even the highlight.

-----------------------

The Negative: Full disclosure before going forward, I HATE faux meat products. The chemicals used to create and flavour faux meat is across the board a worse pollutant than the actual act of farming the respective live stock. So if you love animals, but hate the planet they live on, than faux meat is your thing and you should take my review with a grain of salt.

The food is 'almost hit' or 'miss'. Some of the items are good. Not great. Anything with fresh vegetables are a good bet. But there was always something to sour the experience. On one trip I got the Butter Chicken and found myself incapable of finishing the portion. The rice was overcooked mush, the sauce was way too thick, and the faux chicken... I was under the impression it was free range chicken. I saw something in the freezer made with \"Free Range Chicken\", so I assumed when I got the Butter Chicken, they would use chicken because there was nothing informing me otherwise. It was disgusting. I was trained as a kid to never throw out food, and with a price tag of $7 for the modest portion, I was inclined to obey that training. But when I got to the last quarter of my meal I realized I would pay extra to stop eating, and that's when I threw the rest out; something I have not done in at least a decade. So make things worse, despite 3 minutes in the oven, the rice in the centre was still cold.

I hate to judge the food of a place off one item, so I tried the pad-thai. A fridge only product with a steep price of $12. But the portion was large enough that I figured I could get two meals out of it. The portion is quite large, but since you're dealing primarily with vegetables, I was able to eat 90% of it in one sitting. The vegetables were good, but lost some of its freshness sitting in the fridge. The in-house sauce was good, but not great. 

I also tried a wrap, which is made with store bought wraps (likely purchased from the nearby metro). If you've tried one of those wraps before, you know they have an artificial flavour to them. What went in to the wrap was good, but when you have a gross store bought wrap holding it all together, whats the point? Just google \"BEST EVER HOMEMADE FLOUR TORTILLAS\" and you'll find a ton of recipes you can make in even a small kitchen. Why buy them in a store? I bet you can even make it with Rice flour to service the non-glutten crowd. 

-----------------------

The Conclusion: The awesome people there kept me coming back to try just one more dish, hoping I could find a saving grace. But one dish after another left me feeling underwhelmed, or flat out nauseous. And it's truly a disappointment because   i've been dying to find a reasonably priced vegetable takeout meal. If you're passing by looking for a snack, I recommend grabbing a juice and a bag of popcorn. If you are out looking for a meal, keep on walking."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today. Great place, with incredibly friendly service. Food is clean, fresh, and delicious. 

Yes, it's pricier than what you're going to pay for in a grocery store. But at the same time, this is a pretty specialized place and these people need to make a living in a high rent area. I couldn't afford to shop here every week, but I'll do what I can to keep them in business. So I'll definitely be returning. 

Also, they're the only place I know of in Toronto that carries Field Roast veggie sausages, aka the God of Veggie Sausage."}
{"text":"There is so many amazing vegan grocery I would love to buy.

They're my first vegan deli, it's worth the checking out!"}
{"text":"YamChops is a one of a kind vegetarian butcher - the first in Canada! After being open for two months, I finally went to check it out last weekend. The staff are very welcoming and offer samples and their knowledge of the product.

I was offered a sample of their Tuna-less Tuna, Kale Caesar salad, Coconut Ba-con, and faux chicken. All wonderful stuff! A true vegetarian dream (and I believe most of their products are vegan, too!).

For the product I believe the pricing is fair. It's all made with fresh, real ingredients from scratch. A lovely treat! For example, I ended up buying 200g of the tuna-less tuna for around $5.50 - enough to fill 3 sandwich buns at home for work lunches. Awesome!

I also went home with the Kale Caesar and Moroccan Quinoa Salad. And the next time I'm invited to a BBQ, I know where I'll be getting my meatless burgers and dogs!

 I hope YamChops grows big enough to become available in other Canadian cities :)"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a friend because she's vegan. I'm personally not but I think if I were, I would definitely frequent this place!
For me, as a foodie, it's not always about what the food is made of and how expensive the raw ingredients are. It's more about the finished product, how palatable it is, and its overall presentation.

I ordered the daily special, which happened to be the Hickory BBQ Pulled Chicken wrap for a little under $9 and my friend ordered the Szechuan Beef wrap, to which she commented was the best tasting faux-beef she's had as of yet.

My sandwich was pretty good for what it was! I could definitely tell it wasn't chicken, as the texture had slightly more of an elastic bounce, but the mouthfeel was acceptable and the flavours complemented it fairly well. I also very much enjoyed the cranberry coleslaw that came as a side. It was sweet, crunchy, refreshing, and really tied up the dish to make it feel like a complete meal. 

Service was also great, the employee was friendly and allowed us to sample some of the products before choosing!"}
{"text":"I desperately want to like this place. The service was so warm and friendly. The shop is immaculate. It has an excellent punny name. However: alkalizing water? Encouraging juice cleanses (I love fresh juice!)? Detoxifying (Your body does that itself!)? C'mon, I don't need a side of snake oil with my beet burgers! The kale caesar salad was pretty tasty, but a little too salty which is forgivable since we all like different amounts of basic seasoning. The coconut bacon was really just kind of salty coconut (I've had really excellent coconut bacon in Montreal and I've made it at home so I know it's possible). I also had a slice of the Indonesian tofu; but it was so pasty and the tofu itself had an overwhelming flavour of ... well I don't quite know, but it seemed like rancid oil. I'm sad and I wish I could write something better here about my experience but I will never accept sub par vegetarian food no matter how common it is."}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan food I have ever had. Highly recommend you stopping in and trying this. The variety is huge and the quality, texture and flavors are great."}
{"text":"Don't lie, you knew I'd be FTR on the only veggie butcher shop in town. They just opened their doors Monday, so they're still trying to find their flow.

The deli counter was not as well stocked as I was hoping but I'm sure it will fill up with time. I tried to tuna-less salad which is made with chickpeas and vegan mayo (assuming, since it said vegan) and dill. Pretty tasty, but I did have sticker shock at the $7 price tag for the small container. It's heavy but not filled with expensive ingredients so I'm kind of blown away that it cost almost as much as a sandwich (or as much as a cheap sandwich) but was only about 1/2 cup of food.

When I make this at home I do it in bucket sized portions and I'm sure it's still doesn't cost $7. Dry chickpeas are really cheap! I know the prepared foods racket (especially by weight) skews expensive, but things should not cost as much as an actual butcher shop here. That would kind of defeat being the better alternative to a real butcher. It should be win on all fronts and still make YamChops owners a healthy profit.

There were very few prepared meats. They only had one vegan beet burger, which was disappointing. The sausages and other burger were all vegetarian, which probably means egg. 

They are also selling Sol cuisine meatless products which I like but really hope they make their own artisanal stuff. Then you could actually charge the big bucks and not have me feel like I'm paying for sauce on marked up processed foods that are sold at any grocery store.

A lot of the other things that caught my eye below the counter turned out to be vegetarian, like the carrot lox, but sadly the tags don't offer any information on ingredients so you have to ask why things are vegetarian and not vegan. Since there's no visible dairy, eggs is turning out to be the main culprit. 

Overall, needs more time to develop but I certainly hope to see them lower the prices on simple things like chickpea salad and offer more unique vegan options that cannot be found anywhere else. They'd sell more and put people off with the prices less. Repeat customers and stealing customers away from the meat-y butcher shops in town should be their goal."}
{"text":"I've heard its great, but you need to come for lunch; don't bother with dinner as everything \"usually runs out\" by 5:00. I guess I'll never know, i left empty handed and with an empty belly."}
{"text":"5 stars for the awesome frozen section ALONE, let alone the fresh stuff. I love this place."}
{"text":"After an evening of vegetarian eating, the plan for day 2 was to make lunch at home after visiting this \"vegetarian butcher shop\". The store is comprised of a mix house made fresh food items, as well as freezers surrounding the back and side walls with a variety of other externally sourced frozen foods and YamChops own various sauces. 

Their in house made \"meats\" can be bought and are priced based on weight, usually around $3-4 per 100mg, The Korean \"Chick'n\" and Cashew \"Chick'n\" are actually really good. A small container will cost about $6 and be enough for 1 meal over rice. 
The freezer section also has lots of interesting vegetarian options. I went with the boneless meatless chicken wings for $6. They were interesting but weren't as good as the in house made items. 

If I actually were to commit to vegetarian eating (which frankly, I'm not), I could see myself coming here pretty frequently. It's not cheap, but that's typically the case for anywhere that stresses healthier eating... So 4 stars seem apropos."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious with a variety of distinct tastes from all over the world. The staff are super friendly and helpful and I was able to sample just about everything that was available :D I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Beet burgers are delicious! Field Roast sausages are amazing. Love the Mongolian Beef... Delicious food. Slightly expensive but a compassionate choice. Staff are also really friendly!"}
{"text":"We used to live just down the street from YamChops so I've followed them since before they even opened and was very excited about it! We also went there from day one and tried pretty much everything they offer.

I really like that they serve tasty vegan food and the staff is incredibly friendly, the store is clean and modern and you can get all kind of other healthy foods there as well.

The only problem I have with yam chops is the pricing. The wraps got smaller and smaller over time, like so much! It's just not enough food for that price anymore. I'm still hungry after eating a wrap (and I'm a tiny woman) so I'm going elsewhere for lunch now. My friends I used to go there with feel the same. It is really too bad.

The juice is very pricey too and it's not organic or made right there in front of you, so I am not willing to pay that amount. I am also not a huge fan of naming things after meat products. Just call it by its name, it will still be delicious.

We basically stopped going there now and it's a bit sad because I generally like the idea and used to be a fan and happily supported and recommended this business."}
{"text":"I work down the street from YamChops so it is super convenient to grab lunch from. As a recently converted veg, this place definitely helps with the transition. They have great mock meats and the set up is great because as they prepare your food you can shop around and taste test their delicious fresh pressed juices. Their staff have always been very friendly and welcoming as well.  

My fav: Korean bbq chick'n"}
{"text":"Beautiful friendly Vegan takeout or eat in restaurant.

They have great selection of faux meat products. Staff is friendly and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Quick lunch stop on my walk home. Friendly staff, sampled the Szechwan 'beef' and ordered the Dragon salad, both were yummy. I would go back when I felt like something veggie based and satisfying."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the unique offerings here. Just like a traditional deli with 'meats' but also some really really great salads. Their lunch combos are great too. I'm also happy to see yam chops products offered at different stores across the GTA, even in Vaughn! (Gasp!). The legit meat butcher near me on St. Clair West even carries some of their burgers. Crazy times!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Yam Chops. I came first thing when they opened on a Sunday. They were very friendly and explained the different options I had and how they were made. I ended up purchasing one beet burger, one yam burger, a \"chicken\" cutlet and some coconut bacon. The pricing was a tad on the pricey end but its pretty average for \"specialty\" items. I eager to try out all the goodies I purchased."}
{"text":"Yamchop is fantastic! This food is super clean and so yummy... try the chocolate ice cream - I can't believe there is no dairy in... so good- unbelievable..."}
