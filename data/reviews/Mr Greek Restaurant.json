{"text":"Food was very tasty. I got the traditional chicken and lamb dish. staff was friendly to help with the customized options you have. fair. prices considering the size of the meal. they also take orders for pick up. easy parking and bus station is steps away. I'd go back and recommend this location"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Mr. Greek, this location has been around for a while and I'm never disappointed when I come in. My menu choices vary depending on the day, and today was a classic Chicken Souvlaki Pita kind of day. Always good food, and they just did a great Reno. I'm loving the atmosphere that the Reno made. See you on the next visit!"}
{"text":"One question.. The signs states EXPRESS.
Why does it take half an hour to get a meal!!
I get faster service at Montanas next door!
Not only that, why are the chicken pieces so tiny and always burnt?!
Being from the Mediterranean area and Greek being Mediterranean food.. I'm pretty sure I know a good piece of chicken souvlaki.
I always regret returning to this place. You DEFINITELY don't get what you pay for."}
