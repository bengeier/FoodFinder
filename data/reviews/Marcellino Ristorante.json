{"text":"This is one of my favorite 'celebration night out' places.  The owners are wonderfully nice and friendly.  The service was great - excellent timing on filling water, clearing table - it was all seamless.   Now the food!  Home made pasta, fresh and original. Everything was tempting but I can never resist the specialty of the day - seafood linguini, mushroom sauce, or any other meats - gently cooked!  Perfect!  With a bottle of wine, meal and dessert - it can get pricey but it's well worth it!   They do offer Valentine 'take out baskets' which are reasonably priced (considering) and sound wonderful -i must admit, i have never tried them though."}
{"text":"we went to Marcellino since it was recommended to us as one of the finest restaurants in Scottsdale. Not so. It probably is the worst food I have ever tasted. The mozzarella was very rubbery like the one bought from a supermarket. Their signature pasta was thick and bland. The pork medallion was totally inedible and the only good item in our order was the wine. At some point the chef/owner came to talk and would no go away till we started to get up. This was definitely frendliness bordering on harassment."}
{"text":"So we went here for our 3 year anniversay because of all the 5 stars it had received.  Maybe I had raised my expectations because of it, but it didn't seem 5 star great to me.    We went on a Wednesday night at 6:30, and we were the ONLY ones for the entire time!  Kinda odd, to me, for having so many great reviews.  The pastas were great.  We shared an appetizer: the buffalo mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto and with basil and tomatoes.  That was pretty darn tasty.  Pretty much a caprese with prosciutto wrapped around the cheese.  My hubby got the gnocchi, which was SO good.  I don't like gnocchi, but THIS gnocchi I loved!  It wasn't heavy like others I have tried, it was light and fluffy and perfectly chewy.  I had the shrimp and linguine.  It was delicious as well.  Maybe lacking a bit in salt.  It was a lot of food so I took some home for left overs.  The ambience was alright.  It's strange it's in a strip mall.  But it was cutely decorated and dim.  Not quite sure if we'd go again, but it was fun to try."}
{"text":"We went to Marcellino for our anniversary and it was amazing. Everyone was so friendly, the live music was great, and the food was divine. We are more than too much but we left happy. We are definitely planning on going back to try the Chef's tasting menu. The only downside was the parking in Old Town Scottsdale is horrible."}
{"text":"Marcellinos if you haven't been you are missing out. It is truly a dining experience and the food is out of this world. The hostess, savannah was so pleasant and adorable I might add. Our server Daniel was just unbelievable. The food though was the best Italian food I have ever had.  I had a chance to meet the owners and they are just fun and wonderful and sweet as honey. Would highly recommend this place it is an experience you won't soon forget."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner there this evening - I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing the service was ... our waitress, Paula, was fabulous!!  She grew up in Rome ( I grew up in Milan)... She could not have been any friendlier and informative on the specials... Meanwhile, Salvatore \"Sal\" (the owner) ...I have a secret crush on...he treated us like royalty - we spoke Italian...he gave us a grappa AND the piano player!! He was fabulous!! NOW HONESTLY...where can you get AMAZING italian food, fabulous, friendly service, reasonable prices, great wine AND an extremely talented pianist!!! BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing!  You can't get any more authentic italian than this.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pasta is made in house.  The wines, which are imported directly from Italy, pair perfectly with the chef's delectible dishes.  The sea food is prepared with superiority.  I have only had the dishes with clams or shrimp, but all were equally excellent.  The decor is sharp and elegant, and the lighting is soft and romantic.  A great date place!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the first time I went there it was amazing!  Second time was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in old town in years.  1st when greeted by the hostess she had an attitude and wasn't very inviting.  2nd when we decided to sit at the bar because the hostess was so rude it took over 20 minutes for us to place our drink order.  3rd the owner knocked my friends purse on the floor instead of apologizing immediately she instructed my friend to put her purse on the hooks under the bar.  And finally, there was a bug in my ice cube.  In all fairness our drinks were compensated for the bug; however the attitude of the owner / hostess was so awful I won't be returning or recommending their restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!    We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!  Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!  Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!  Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!  We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!  We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday, we had a excellent time. Food was great and loved the ambience. Great for a date night, very romantic with candles and roses. You also get free bread with a dip which was tasty.  I wasn't a fan of the cheesecake wish it had crust on the bottom. This place also is very pricey and portions weren't that big. Overall great experience and would come back."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was not over the top.  The service was excellent and so was the ambiance of the place.  The chef would not modify any of the dishes and if you wanted to just add chicken to a pasta dish, you got to pay for an entire chicken dinner.  The waiter laer cam eback and sid he reduced the charges on \"only\" $15 for the chicken breasts. The prices are high but the dishes are unique.  You won't find lasagna here or chicken parm, just some very unique pasta dishes.  It was great to experience it once but I don't have any desire to go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were vacationing to Arizona in June 2011.  We are not from the area so we like to get local recommendations and find some great places through yelp. After our awful experience here, I just had to sign up on yelp and tell everyone my our experience (do not disregard because I am new to giving my opinion on yelp). We had no reservations but that doesn't mean you have to give us such a bad attitude when we asked for a table?  Yet, I think they gave us the worst table because we had no reservations?  Literally 2 mins after we were seated, they seated 2 older men right next to us and we might as well been a table of 4!  They were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation.  How romantic.  The places wasn't even full and there were empty tables! Nice selection of fresh made pasta... But I ended up ordering a dish from their regular menu, Red Linguine Portifino with shrimps and scallops.  The sauce just ok and wasn't even that spicy. And what scallops?  There were barely any in the dish.  And the shrimps...are you kidding me?  They were tiny and with the full tail on which was like half the shrimp because they were so small.  I've been to many fancy italians restaurants and when I order an expensive past dish, I expect not to spend most my time picking the tail off with my knife and fork.  What a pain.  Funny thing is, then loud man sitting next to us order the same dish.  Instead of using his fork and knife, he simply put the whole shrimp in his mouth and used his fingers to pull the tail out.  How classy!!   I almost forgot to add, it was nice one of the chef's walked around and said hello and asked how everything was but if you are going to do that, why exclude CERTAIN tables?  Very rude. All in all, for the expensive price we paid for dinner, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Nothing was outstanding - for the prices, I had much higher expectations."}
{"text":"We were in town for a weekend away and our hotel book the reservation.  This place was amazing from the moment we sat at the bar to the time we waddled out of the joint 2 hours later.  The bar:  Classic, perfectly lit, bartender was about as good as it gets (and I can't remember his name).  We had a great bottle of white (Italian) with our friends and chatted with the bartender about dinner suggestions.  Was pleased that of all the items on the menu he actually walked us through many, he asked us questions about what we like and steered us appropriately.  Getting to the food:  It was the first week of October and we chose to sit outside....ahhh, perfect.  The only hiccup of our entire experience came when 10 minutes after seating us we still hadn't been approached by a server.  We flagged the hostess (What's the right way to call the person who greets you, seats you and is one of the owners?) and she couldn't stop apologizing.  What was great was that instead of sticking one of the waiters on us, she saw how much fun we had at the bar and had the bartender act as our server as well.  Food:  Needless to say we all were guided to wonderful dinner choices.  I can honestly say that this was the absolute best pasta-centric meal I've ever eaten.  Mine had 1/2 a lobster, an amazing sauce and other goodness in it.  Is it possible for pasta to melt in your mouth?  Mine did.  The other 3 at the table had the same experience.  We also had a wonderful tour of Italy via the wine that was paired with things.  Dessert was amazing as well.  Marcellino had the quaintness of a family owned place combined with the experience and food quality of a fine restaurant.  I cannot say enough about the quality of the food and the service.  If you have the chance, go there!"}
{"text":"Ate at their new location in Scottsdale last week. Not only is the restaurant very tastefully done inside but the food,service & presentation are excellent. We have been at the old location and very happy of the move to Scottsdale. Never had an average meal as it's usually very good. Strongly recommend the home made pasta's. We were also surprised with a male & female opera singer which added some charm."}
{"text":"Great food, but way overpriced for the portions you get.   I think of Italian food as you get a lot, but $40 for a small bowl of pasta is way to much."}
{"text":"My husband and I adore Marcellino's. If you are looking for a special evening out for Italian food, look no further. This is not your family-style restaurant, it's high end with amazing homemade pastas, fresh salads, spotless service, truly a wonderful experience. From the time you make a reservation, you are greeted with warmth, just as if you were invited into their home. We have followed them from their old location in north Phoenix to the new in Scottsdale. Somehow they were able to keep the intimacy of the smaller restaurant to their new, larger location. My only complaint is that the restaurant is so dark it makes reading the menus difficult (they should offer flashlights or invest in backlit menus). We have had two company parties at their restaurant. They easily cater to large groups. Our food arrived steaming hot all at once (incredible for a party of 13). I wish I could recommend a favorite dish, but my favorite is whatever I ordered during my last visit! You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The bar is we'll stocked and he makes great mixed drinks. Definitely arrive a few minutes early to start off at the bar before being seated for your meal."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Italian food I've ever had. A little pricey but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!!   But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.  Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point."}
{"text":"You can really taste the difference between homemade fresh pasta here and the alternative at some other italian places.  They had to have what seemed like at least 20 different pasta varieties at this place all with a plethora of meats, veggies, spices, and different sauces. The dim lighting, white tablecloths and red brick made for perfect decor for a romantic evening.  Back to the food - it was amazing. Lots of umami going on. OK, I don't know I just wanted to throw umami into a review at least once. What the hell is umami again? Anyway, the pasta just kind of melted in your mouth with all of the sauces/butter/whatever else cooking magic they performed in the kitchen.  Tiramisu was also delicious and a good size.  Know this place can be pretty pricey - they bring out a tray of pastas that aren't on the menu that of course sound delicious in the hopes that you will order one of those instead of the menu pastas that are 10-20 dollars cheaper.  With a bottle of wine/dessert/appetizer your  looking at $$$$ here.  I did get black truffle on my pasta though so I suppose you do get what you pay for. Mmmmm black truffle - that's umami right?"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place after Olive and Ivy completely botched our reservation.  What a stumble ! Our server, Mike, was fabulous, full of information, suggestions and was very attentive. The four of us ordered different entrees, veal, fish and red meats. I think the favorite was the tortellini filled with shredded beef short ribs and surrounded by a deep, rich, chunky red sauce. Killer ! We cannot WAIT to go back ! I am seriously obsessing about the tortellini ! Also, the yummy Italian bread is served with an eggplant/roasted red pepper purée ...amazing !"}
{"text":"Do you know what \"scampi\" really is?  I learned new food fact at Marcellino this week, something I should have known, but most of us probably don't. \"Scampi\" is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like a shrimp. I've always assumed \"scampi\" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled \"on the half shell\". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell."}
{"text":"The worst experience in my life. The menu is not clear and the waitress did a horrible job describing the ingredients."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant so far in Scottsdale!!  We always get the Hand made thick and chewy noodles!! Sooooo  gooood!!"}
{"text":"The food is truly wonderful. Homemade pasta and soups. I had zucchini soup that was not made with cream, but pureed, so it was lighter and very  tasty. The half order of ravioli included 2 large squares that was plenty for lunch. Very tasty with a light butter sage sauce.  Better than any pasta I have had before! Even in Italy. The atmosphere is Tuscan with nice decorations. My only wish is that their lunch items were priced a little less. Lunch is pricey. It would be a wonderul dinner place. The service was amazing."}
{"text":"The worst ever!  Our food was cold and tasteless. A group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school.  There were 8 of us and the restaurant was not busy.  All of our food was served cold, obviously it had sat in the kitchen.  We sent back two meals and they brought tasteless pasta dishes and kept the two expensive meals on the bill. They left the table with our  dirty dishes sitting in front of us for 40 minutes.  Once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff. Due to our daughters tears when we complained, as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible, we let it go and paid our bill.  I wrote them after and have gotten NO response from them.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"Should be renamed Blandini's.  No seasoning.  NONE!  We were in a large group & had limited options.   Salad was OK.  Spinach Ravioli was two large pieces, but missing sauce & seasoning.  It got worse from there.  Our entrees were completely bland.  Absent salt, pepper, and herbs of any kind.  Husband had lamb.  Knowledgeable diner (Cordon Bleu grad) said the \"sea bass\" was tilapia.  They accomodated me with chicken, it had some tomatoes on it, but just was missing flavor.  I'm not sure if they dumbed down their seasoning thinking to aim for something a person from the Midwest would like, but we're from Texas and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED in this food.  Can't remember what we had for desert, but it was ample & tasted good.  Servers did a good job, considering the size of our group."}
{"text":"The carpaccio di manzo was OK but I felt that the carpaccio was over powered by the arugola. This was followed by the fagottino di pollo. I have never had chicken that was so tough that it was hard to cut with a knife. It was quite the disappointment for what I was anticipating to be a wonderful experience. We cut our losses after that and ended the night elsewhere."}
{"text":"The new location for this long time Valley favorite is in Old Town Scottsdale on Restaurant row right accross from Cowboy Ciao.  This used to be Digestiff.    The Marcellino's people have done a wonderful job of creating an entirely different attidtude on this side of Stetson Drive.  Still very cool, very ambient, very laid back and not at all pretentious, but still different experience.  The thick cranberry colored drapesgive an old world quality to the mostly urban brickwork comprising most of the walls.  lit mostly by chandeliers and candlelight, the interior is warm, intimate and easy. No garish paintings or stereo typical florentine towers to be seen.  Well, there was a small reproduction of Rome's \" Mouth of Truth\" bolted to the wall next to the entry that kept staring down at me.  I liked it.  It brought back happy memories of Rome.  We would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.  Wine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.  After four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.  Live music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.  This Sunday evening we had a mixture of Sade and other light jazz simmering from the sound system.  A wonderful evening was had and will be remembered.  thank you Marcellino's!"}
{"text":"The chefs \"daily\" pastas were some of the best I've ever had. I got a huge tortilini with steak and vegatbles puréed inside. The ambience is very nice but the arrangement of the tables isn't the best. That's why it's not getting 5 stars. Other wise, everything else was scratch."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.  Marcellino's has the most romantic atmosphere I have ever seen in a restaurant. Tucked away in Scottsdale, this little gem is the real deal. In fact, it took me extra long to order because the entire menu was in Italian. The place holds 2 bars, intimate seating in both booths and sperate tables for dates and romantic getaways.   Candle-lit tables, attentive wait staff, fancy place settings, live music, etc. This place has it all. I went here on a (not so great) first date with a guy I met at a bar and he easily dropped $200 on 2 appetizers, fancy water, 4 beers, 2 gigantic entrees and dessert plus (hopefully) a generous tip.   I had the stuffed torteillini because I am a total sucker for lots of pasta. Expecting it to come in a bowl of a bunch of smaller shells, it was actually 4 very large rolls drinched in this heavenly white sauce. I loved it... and so did my date, he ate off my plate. We also order the capriesse salad which came with a beautiful, ripe tomato and a fat slice of parmesan too. The dressing was light but flavored enough that not much pepper was needed.   I cannot wait to go back to this place... on a different date with a different guy. But only if he's paying!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful and service was excellent.  Unfortunately, the food was less than mediocre.  Ravioli special with spinach and ricotta was like sand, pasta was hard,marinara with sausage, pasta under cooked, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Marcellino. This is supposed to be one if not best Italian restaurant in town. I was very disappointed in their specialty - the fresh pastas -   Many classic dish are offered and many different cut of pasta. The quality doesn't justify the stiff prices. Just ok!"}
{"text":"My grandmother and I went here for lunch the first time today and it was wonderful. Nice, light lunch options which was perfect in the heat (we sat outside) and cool house made lemonade. Kind waitress and felt like a slice of Italy!"}
{"text":"In college (not that long ago, but boy I am getting old fast) I had the opportunity to spend a month in northern Italy.  Marcellino Ristorante takes me back.  You will find no finer Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  The pastas are exceptional, unique, and fresh.  The atmosphere is superb.  The wait staff if phenomenally proficient yet down to earth and friendly at the same time.  You owe it to yourself to treat you and a loved one to this experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Pricey but worth it.  The veal parmigiana is to die for, and my husband's chicken marsala looked great as well.  The desserts were delicious, the garlic bread was delicious, the pasta was out of control...   The owner is so friendly and he came over to the table to talk to us.  The service was impeccable.  I cannot recommend it highly enough if you are in the scottsdale az"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place the food is good and the service is excellent. Marcellino and his wife are very friendly.. they make you feel at home. My wife and I enjoy the freshly made pasta and seafood. The only thing I miss is the old location...the Scottsdale place is very nice but the old location made you feel that you were some where else plus the opera singers that would attend the old location...omg it was awesome. Don't get me wrong the new place is beautiful but I still miss the old location:("}
{"text":"When you have grown up loving and appreciating food, and have travelled extensively here in the U.S. as well as abroad, and wanted to dedicate your life to the creative process of preparing food at an early age, and already having lived many decades, it came as a wonderful shock to be so impressed and taken with a local restaurant after eating there for the first time! My daughter and son-in-law gave us a gift certificate last Christmas for Marcellino Restorante located in Scottsdale,  which was about to expire on June 21st.  Couldn't let that happen, so the wife and I decided to go on a Saturday to avoid evening rush hour traffic.  After reading many reviews on Yelp, and in the AZ Republic, I knew it was considered a very good choice for an Italian meal.  Well I have to say it was a very good choice no matter what the cuisine!  During the 48 hour period after we ate there, we constantly had thoughts during the day and dreams during the night about how tasty and wonderful the food was.  We don't think this has ever happened to us before.   The restaurant was classy, attractive and comfortable, the wait staff friendly, knowledgable and efficient, not at all stuffy or obtrusive.  I enjoyed the double layer of linen tablecloths adorning our table. We ordered their special blend of iced tea, a black tea with lavender, apricot and rose hips,  unusally tasty, an uncommon occurance in my experience.  I should have known if I liked the tea so much, the rest had to be exceptional, and it was!  Since their pasta had received rave reviews, and they bothered to bring a large platter of uncooked pastas to the table like many restaurants show off their desserts, we knew we were in for a treat.  We decided to order two pasta dishes,  Gnocchi Sorrentina (described on the menu as \"perfectly light potato/pasta dumplings floating in tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella cheese melting within\", and Tagliolini Mare e Monte (the tomato sauce had small shrimp, tail on, and mixed mushrooms, with lovely little chunks of tomato).  We told our waiter that we were intending to share the dishes and he brought them out with one half of each pasta dish on our plates, pre-shared you might say.  There was an unbeliveable explosion of flavors in our mouths, the pasta cooked perfectly al dente.  We were like two little kids in a candy store, oohing and aahing as we cleaned our plates.  Next followed our one shared entree,  Salmone in Crosta di Porcini e Porri, described on the menu as \"Atlantic salmon dipped in porcini (mushroom) flour and sauted with fresh leeks and cognac\".  Ordered slightly beyond medium, the fish couldn't have been cooked any more perfect!  I am drooling as I write this review, I can't help myself.  The fish was served with semi crunchy sticks of zucchini and fluffy mashed potatos with a little branch of fresh rosemary sticking up like a miniature tree. We continued to hum throughout this meal.  To finish this gastronomic orgasm I had a double decaf expresso and the wife had their blend of decaf coffee and our dessert choice, a chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries topped with whipped cream.  It was unbelievable how each plate outdid the next! Chef Marcellino Verzino greeted us as we were leaving and I told him he was a \"flavor magician\" whose magic will be long remembered.  Until you have eaten here, you haven't really eaten \"real Italian pasta\"!"}
{"text":"We came here for reaturant week and a birthday. While it was not noted on the restaurant week website or the restaurant's website, your entire party had to order either from the restaurant week menu or the normal menu, no exceptions. We tried to protest this because there was nothing about this on the websites, but the hostess said that it was their first restaurant week and that the chef did not want to make any accommodations. While the food was good, the waitstaff was very rude an unattentive. Our waitress explained their pasta specialties very quickly and then said she would come back for our order. When she came back we said that we would all order off the normal menu and asked if she could repeat the specialties because we were a bit overwhelmed by the menu choices. She was not happy about it but she repeated them and then took our orders. The food came out within 10 minutes piping hot, which was nice but the waitress did not warm us that the plates were hot and my mother unfortunately burned her hand. We were never brought bread, and had to ask for it after we already received our meals. It came with some sort of chilled red spread that was never explained. We asked after the end of the meal and the waitress said it was an eggplant and sundried tomato mix. While we said that we were celebrating a birthday the waitress said that they did not do anything complementary but that they would do a nice presentation of a dessert if we wanted one. We said no thank you but she brought us a nice free biscotti plate that said \"happy birthday\" on it, which was very nice. The restaurant was also very loud and we could not hear each other across the table. Overall it was an interesting experience but not one that I would repeat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to visit Marcellino's the night before Christmas Eve to celebrate with a decent dinner before heading back east for the holidays. Unfortunately, this was a huge mistake and I would strongly discourage anyone from ever visiting this place. The first red flag was one which many others have stated before, was that the restaurant was completely empty. The hostess quickly questioned us if we had made a reservation, and without further ado she, as well as our waiter gave us a head to toe scan. Both of us felt quite uncomfortable in our casual patagonia sweaters. In hind sight Im glad that I didn't wear a nicer outfit since it would have been a complete waste. The ambiance of the place is completely commercialized with a tacky unauthentic Italian feel (yes, it really is like a fancier olive garden).   The worst part about this place was the remarkably awful service. Our waiter who left halfway through our meal (thank god) was a complete arrogant ass. While looking over the wine menu, our waiter suggested that he make some recommendations since it was taking us longer then 5 minutes to decide on a bottle. After questioning our knowledge on Italian wines, the waiter proceeded to question us on our price point in the most obnoxious and uncomfortable way, (he then flipped through the menu narrating which wines were and were not in our price range... how helpful) my boyfriend felt like he was being financially assessed. After ordering the wine I quickly requested a Caprese salad so that I could limit the interaction with the waiter- but alas! He denied my request and proceeded to come back with a fake plate of pasta, a 12 minute sales pitch, and a tiny florescent light to point with. How romantic. It was a horrible experience, and I assured him after wasting all of our time that I would go with my original request. The best part of this experience was the fact that this waiter was unable to pronounce any of the dishes correctly. Hello?! My first suggestion would be to train your staff on Italian pronunciation- at least make sure they can pronounce the listed dishes correctly.  The food was...edible but everything was unnecessarily dramatic. I was able to catch a glimpse of the chef who was schmoozing with who I would assume to be his regular customers obviously we did not even get a glance from him (mind you there were only 4/5 tables occupied at 8 pm). Before our entries arrived our waiter made a dramatic exit speech and introduced us to our new waiter who assured us that our previous waiter was going home to spend the holidays with his lady, a detail I could have cared less about particularly after he ruined my night.   All together the experience was one which I would like to forget and we quickly left once our entries were finished. After spending a good portion of my life traveling all over the world and having a mother who assessed hotel hospitality, I was hourly unimpressed by this restaurant and will not be recommending it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta and a great atmosphere make for a wonderful date night. French Wines selection is great. Tonight our dinner was accompanied by live music. Lots of dinning option from eating at the bar to private diners for two with wine pairing.  You have to come!"}
{"text":"I hate to rain on everyone's 5 stars parade but... We had a late dinner.  One of us had the gnocchi Sorrentina, one had the Scialatielli alle Vongole (clams).  Followed by a shared ricotta cheesecake and a cappuccino. We both agreed that their handmade pasta was among the best we've ever had.  The gnocchi was particularly light and tasty. But... - If you've ever bought freshly made pasta at a farmer's market, and cook it at home al dante, the results is not that different. - The fresh bread was cold, borderline stale. - The famous spread for the bread was good, but nothing to write home about. - The Italian cheesecake with ricotta was very good, but not quite what you get in Italy or even a good NY restaurant. - Otherwise the cappuccino was exceptional, world-class, no exaggeration. - Service was very good although the waiter could have been Parisian... probably from Rome though.   Now you may think those comments are a little harsh.  Not really given the tab of $77.    Perhaps if we had come with a bigger appetite and tripled the bill, we would have had a better experience.   But I don't think I'm willing to take that kind of risk."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced! We paid easily 40% more for our dinner here than we would do for the same meal in Chicago. And no Italian beer! While the meal itself was fine, there was nothing about the surroundings, the environment or the service that justified the cost. You are left with the impression that the target diner is an unassuming tourist sent by the hotel concierge and who doesn't have a backup plan when they see the menu and they can't leave."}
{"text":"Excellent. Fresh pasta, wonderful live music and great service.  Fresh herbs picked from front bed -YES!!"}
{"text":"Good experience, at a high cost, which is why it gets three-stars. We ordered a multitude of dishes to be able to try as many items as possible. The caprese was eh.., two other pastas (that I don't remember the name of) was just mediocre, our third pasta, which was a mushroom pasta with more sautéed mushrooms was absolutely delicious, and the best of its kind. With one of the dishes, we ordered a side of veggies, which came out with exactly 3 pieces of zucchini, and 3 pieces of carrots and were charged 9.95 for! unbelievable that they don't have any hesitations with charging you that much after the vegetarian pasta was almost 33 bucks! Anyways, We ended the evening with their ricotta cheesecake, which was also delightful, but I'd definitely recommend having people at the table to share it with. Overall, good place, but be ready to spend!"}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day. We had the prosciutto wrapped burrata, gnocchi and filet stuffed ravioli (or tortellini, I can't remember?). Service and food were excellent...only thing I wish they had were side salads. Will be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in the city! The service is top notch and food reminds me of the home cooked meals I had every Sunday growing. The only thing that keeps its from a 5 star rating is the price."}
{"text":"Just an incredible experience. We dine out a lot for business and we had visited Marcellino at its prior location in North Phoenix, but had not visited the Old Town Scottsdale location. So, we decided it was time to try that location, and wow, what a killer meal and evening we had!  If you're not familiar, Marcellino features a dazzling authentic Italian menu with house-made pastas such as squid ink fettuccine, and a great wine selection. We had an incredibly fresh and creamy buffalo mozzarella and also the Scallop al Pesto.   I enjoyed a delicious ravioli filled with pureed choice beef, and one of our guests enjoyed a stunning seafood fettuccine with half a Maine lobster. Beautiful dishes.   The three hours simply blew by, and our server Jeff was a true delight. I highly recommend Marcellino!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after traveling to all the Utah parks.  We are from Sonoma County and are real foodies.  I have to say this was some of the best Italian food we've had in a long time. To make it even better, our waiter Charles was fantastic. He even suggested my husband order half-orders of the special pasta and another selection from the menu.  Both were outstanding.  I had the special lamb ragu with pasta. Delicious!  As for the apple pastry with gelato, my husband finished it before I could get two bites. Exceptional meal and superior service.  Be sure to ask for Charles."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my husband.  The food and dessert was very good.  Ambiance was good and pretty romantic.  They have live music.  The only thing I didn't like was the waiters kept coming trying to pick up our plate (when we were taking a break from eating).  It happened about 4 times and we felt like we were being rushed because of it.  Other than that I would return and do recommend it."}
{"text":"I normally love this place, but for me the service drives a significant part of my rating especially when the food is consistently good.   We walked in with a large party for a special occasion. We made reservations, but apparently an error was made with the seating and they split our party up in to two tables. I politely said . . . This has happened before, and we pushed the additional tables together . . .  The server says loudly in my ear \"WE CANT DO THAT\"  Long story short . . . He was rude and he was not willing to accommodate any special requests (he wouldn't even ask the chef for modest dish changes). We work for one of the largest companies in the area (if not the largest), and we just happen to be the leadership team for that location . . . We used to frequent the restaurant, but I think that will change as everyone was annoyed at this waiter.   Tall, big guy, dark hair . . . I didn't ask his name again because he had such an attitude problem.   Marcellinos, you have too good of a restaurant to allow that kind of behavior. I would recommend this restaurant as they make fresh pasta daily and have a nice diverse menu, but if you see a guy that looks like Penn from Penn and Teller without the ponytail . . . Ask for someone else."}
{"text":"Finally checked out Marcellino at their Scottsdale location for the first time.  It's as good as it always has been and the new location offers more space and a nice ambiance. The food is still great, the service was very warm, and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy.  I had feared their move to Scottsdale would cause it to become overly trendy and lose focus, but I far undersold Marcellino and his team.  And despite having great food, the prices are quite reasonable.  Having dined in Italy recently, I can say the experience here was on par with that and hope to I to return soon."}
{"text":"This is a very high-end type of restaurant, with prices to match.   It is not your typical Italian restaurant, so if you are looking for the standard Italian menu, this is not the place for you.    If you are looking for over-the-top service and a unique dining experience, then you will like this place.    I was caught off-guard when I went here, so had to adjust my expectations.      My first impression was the outstanding service of the host, she was exceptionally warm and friendly.     The atmosphere inside is very intimate.      I was very impressed with the plate of homemade pasta menu options that the waiter brought to show us - but then a little disappointed that the majority had red meat in them.   There was one that worked for me, and it was truly outstanding and tasted homemade and chef-prepared.       I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal, except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at, I thought it was over-priced, even for the high-quality of their food.     Loved it, but not enough to go back.   If you are looking for a unique Italian dining experience, maybe for a special occasion, then I highly recommend Marcellinos for you."}
{"text":"Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.  We were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.  The Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!"}
{"text":"Slamming food.. staff is very knowledgeable... great wines.. but don't ask for any changes on the menu.. you get what you get.."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty solid 4 stars!  Great location and ambiance, friendly service and great food.  I ordered the caprese salad which was phenomenal. I usually like balsamic vinegar with it, but I didn't dare to ask for some (maybe next time).  I also had the Fetuccini Contadina which was pretty good.  Tiramisu and coffee were also outstanding.     My friend had an out of the menu pasta with pork belly which was pretty good although a little too salty from my point of view.  The wine menu (by the glass) has only Italian options. Although it's an Italian restaurant, I would appreciate certain variety (but this is just a preference).  BTW, the bathrooms are clean, and with a great decor.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment with a great staff, Isaiah is awesome. Incredible wine list, fresh made infused pastas...the braised filet mignon tortilloni is a must try. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our server Nicole was a treat and AJ a vision to behold. We started with the spirited sangria (the Halloween special drink). Appetizers of the pear salad and the buffalo mozzarella caprese salad, both outstanding.  Entrees of the lamb ragu Papardelli, sausage ravioli, and the filet tortelloni - stupendous! Desserts are always a treat.  This is on the top of our recommendation list for our out of town visitors. It is a premium priced location but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'm sorry--for all the hype this place is a disappointment. And very pricey. I'll just leave it at that."}
{"text":"My expectations were fairly high for this up priced locale,  Sadly, my experience there moved me to \"pen\" this review.  I was first encouraged by the menu and the appearance of some toast and pepper taponade which was very good.  My next course, arugula, olive and greens salad was nicely dressed but with only 3-4 promised fava beans.  I was then presented some pasta courses to choose from (no prices were offered - which I think is in poor taste - but I expected comparable pricing to the ones on the menu) and chose a porcini mushroom and lobster ravioli.  The pasta was also excellent, the mushrooms good but only moderately flavorful and the lobster tasted as if it had been thawed and boiled, clearly overcooked and not fresh.  I mentioned this to my waiter who was helpful and indicated that the chef was making rounds of the tables and I asked him to send him by.  Unfortunately his wife appeared, tasted the lobster, offered to cook me more, sniffed and vanished.  I was billed $39 for this al la carte pasta dish.  The reason for the poor review, thus, was mainly the attitude of the owner, as if rubber flavorless crustacians were the height of italian cuisine.    Enough said.  BTW my next door table mates had the same entree and similar comments."}
{"text":"Food was not as great as I read on the reviews. I went to have a nice dinner with my wife and the waiter was hitting on me. Gross.  food was overpriced and restaurant not that nice."}
{"text":"Ok --  I'm not sure if my husband and I went on an off night or if our waiter was the one that just didn;t make this a \"5 Star\" experience for us.  Not sure...  We got there and just LOVED the lady that greeted us (owner?  she was amazing).  Our table wasn't quite ready but, hey, thats ok!  I was ready for a drink at the bar and I was looking pretty good so I thought I'd be the vamp at the bar that night.  What a cute restaurant!!  The Bartender was AWESOME and had a shot of Limoncello with us.  We loved him immediately.  We sat down, and our waiter came over.  An older dude that was very sweet and he told us our specials.  We split the Beef Carpaccio and it was very good -- a little low on salt -- but very yummy.    I had the scampi special and my hubby had the Wild Boar Tagliatelli -- yummy but missing something.  My Scampi was really not as flavorful as I would have liked -- but it was good.  You can tell the pasta is fresh and I just love that.  Our waiter left us alone for a long time and didn't check back as often as I would have liked.  At the end, he only brought the dessert tray and did not tell us about all the other ice cream flavors they had.  I had to tell him -- because I heard it from all the other waiters when they told their tables.  Now wassup with that?  Also, we were told by the bartender that we get a complimentary shot of limoncello at the end of our meal.  Never happened.  All the other tables did get one though -- so I think it was just our guy.  There will be a second visit -- and I will make sure we get a different waiter.  I really wanted to love this place and the first visit didn't let me love it"}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is.  I went here based on its recommendation in the who's who of restaurants publicized in the So Scottsdale magazine.  It was mediocre, and the ambiance reminded me of eating at Disneyland, you knew it was make believe but you wanted to believe.  I wanted to believe this was going to be a great meal, but instead it was lack luster."}
{"text":"If you're an average person like me who don't care about fancy places, you might want to think twice about coming here. This was a spontaneous dinner choice because bf & I were strolling around the area looking for some place to eat at the time. We ended up spending $125 for two plates of pasta & two glasses of wine. Pasta was good but it was extremely overpriced for how much you get. Our server Egun could care less we were there, said hi once and then popped in again only to give us our check that we hadn't asked for. Probably will never be back."}
{"text":"The only reason why I would give this place 4 stars out of the 5 was because of the wait. The food was absolutely incredible and the environment was so romantic. I love it! BUT it was my birthday dinner so I made a reservation there, of course. 60 minutes past my reservation I got my table and finally ordered food almost another hour past that. Our server was wonderful and the food was beyond incredible though."}
{"text":"Great food. Absolutely amazing. Went here with a group of 7 and the food quality is absolutely amazing. The noodles were all super fresh and I can't say good enough things about the pasta.   The specials really bothered me. Not the food itself but the way there were about 9 options for specials which the waiter zoomed through. How hard would it be to have a small card also explaining the pasta specials? Our group definitely had a hard time remembering all of them. Finally we did have some issues with the food coming out. Half the groups came out then the other half had about a 10 minute delay. Although the chef and owner personally apologized, i had to dock a star.   I totally understand how it would happen, but sadly the lobster of my dish got tough from politely waiting. And so did the shrimp of another.   Overall, I definitely want to go back just for the pasta!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, beautiful atmosphere. The chef is a true Italian, all the pastas were homemade infused with amazing ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley.   If you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter.   Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Marcellino's.  We've been to the old location a few times before, and love the new location in Scottsdale.   I hope they stay put now.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special night out."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sat night.  Very accomodating.  They had a special. 3 corses with wine pairings.  We asked if we could pick the corses and theynchoose the wine.  NO PROBLEM.  Johnny was great!  The lamb shank with pasta was my favorite.  They even had someone softly playing guitar and singing.  Very nice.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was an urban legend. Ate here years ago with a group of my closest friends on a weekend trip to Scottsdale. The restaurant moved to new hipper location. We all refer to this place as the best Italian food we've ever eaten and now that I'm back after all these years I'm delighted it hasn't changed. I'm here on business but I will definitely hit up my friends and plan a trip back if anything so they can have this delicious food again. Glad that some things don't change."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner several times and this place always delivers a great meal and an exceptional experience.  My favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Top 1 or 2 restaurants in az for Italian.   Don't bother ordering off the menu for dinner!!  Get one of the specials!  The beef tortoloni and the pasta with squid ink are ridiculously good!  The buffalo mozzarella appetizer is a must.    Atmosphere is fun, decent wine list.  I make it here once a month."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great service. Wonderful food. The pasta is made fresh and I can tell you - it makes a huge difference. We sat outside on a perfect Arizona evening. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place. Loved it. Good starters loved every bite. Pasta fantastic. And lastly loved the Tiramisu. Will be back"}
{"text":"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!  You shouldn't have to pay $22 for any pasta.  For two people, ordering vegetarian dishes and some wine and salad, the price was about $119.  Ridiculous.  Not even that tasty.  This restaurant has gone downhill, while the prices have gone way up.  I guess if you like a greasy, heavy, expensive, snobby restaurant, this is your place! Where are the friendly neighborhood Italian restaurants of yesteryear?"}
{"text":"My husband loves truffles (the funghi not the chocolate) and tiramisu, so what better way to celebrate his birthday than to take him to an Italian restuarant. So, I called Marcellino to not only make reservations but to ask if they  still had the truffle pasta dish that I saw some people posted here on yelp. The girl on the phone said that they do currently have a sliced truffle pasta dish but they sometimes sell out. So, I made reservations to have an earlier dinner to ensure that my husband will get this dish. I also asked the girl if the restaurant did anything if we were to celebrate his birthday there and the girl said yes and that they offer a complementary tiramisu.  We arrived at the restuarant and were shortly greeted by our server. I asked about the sliced truffle pasta and the server said that they did not have it currently as it is not in season and will have it later in the year. I was pretty disappointed since the whole reason we were there was because I was told that they would have the sliced truffle pasta dish. So my husband ordered their special squid ink pasta with half lobster and I ordered the truffle butter mushroom pasta dish. My husband said it was decent but nothing amazing. While my dish was 'ok' and I wasn't able to really taste the truffle. Although, they say they make their own pasta, it really just tasted like it was regular store bought pasta. Also, the pasta that I had was quite hard for it being \"fresh\".  After finishing our dinner, our server asked if we wanted dessert. Since it was my husband's birthday I had to get him a dessert. However, another thing they didn't have was tiramisu. Feeling sad at this point as I really wanted my husband to try their tiramisu!!! Their excuse was that they didn't have espresso, I mean how difficult is it to go to the store and buy some espresso! Well, we ended up ordering this chocolate mousse in this cup that looks bigger than it really is. Again, it was just \"ok\".  We finally got our bill and was about to pay until I noticed that the dessert was NOT complementary! So I asked the server and he said that the Chef does not give away free desserts. So I told him that the person I spoke to on the phone when I made reservation said you guys did but he just kept repeating what he had told me.  Basically, I was disappointed the whole night and felt that it was a total bust for trying to make my husband's birthday special.  Overall, this place is too expensive for something that taste store bought. Go somewhere else, you will be less angry with the dinner if you went to Olive Garden. They should also keep their host/tess informed of what they are serving."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for 3 days of training and by accident came across this restaurant with a few co-workers. The food was amazing! Besides having such a wonderful meal, our server Scott made the experience first class. Scott's recommendations were spot on and the service was memorable. We were so impressed by this restaurant that we shared our experience with the rest of our co-workers. We decided to go back a couple of days later but this time there was 20 of us dining and of course we requested Scott to be our server once again! Our second experience was even better!   Awesome food, fantastic service, and a memorable experience!! A must for any foodie!"}
{"text":"La vita è bella qui  fettuccine contadina e sorbetto sono deliziosi!! Grazie mille!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were really hoping to enjoy this restaurant more than we did.  The ambiance is very nice, with reds everywhere, along with beautiful pictures of Italy.  Not only that, but they have live music on Thursday and Saturday nights.  Unfortunately you couldn't really hear the live music too well, and the room was very loud, so you couldn't really hear the other people at your table either.  The food was all fine.  We got Polenta for an appetizer, a glass of Wine, and 2 Fresh-Made Pasta specialties - one stuffed with filet mignon.  None of it, outside of my wife's pasta with sausage entree, was particularly memorable, and none of it (based on taste and portion size) was worth the price we paid ($130 total).    Service was just OK.  Our server was too busy, so after greeting us, we waited 5-10 minutes before another server came by and took over.    I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  There are too many other excellent restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this recommendation from a local. The pasta is every bit as good as one would expect from house made pasta. There are the menu standbys and then they have a plate of today's pastas. It was excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a cute little spot with good parking near the restaurant so you don't have to walk far in heels. The food was good and they accommodated my request for more veggies without hesitation. The champagne was delicious and I loved the live musical performance!! All in all a good place for a date night."}
{"text":"Bland and overpriced. Service was great, we were welcomed and given and overview of the menu. Unfortunately, all recommendations fell flat."}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced.   I've been here a number of times and never been impressed with any of the specials or their homemade pastas either. Every time I left however, I was reminded of how expensive it is, especially if you go with chef and waiter recommendations.  We also have a hard time understanding why the owner/chef will not make guest request changes to any of the entrees.  For example, if someone wants a different sauce with their pasta or their entree prepared a certain way, why would the owner refuse to do so ?  I've seen this happen twice at this restaurant and both time guests have been put in unpleasant positions while ruining their dining experience.    Its too bad that there are not that many great italian restaurants in the Phoenix - Scottsdale area, and Marcellino's falls into that category as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale and found Marcellino's  while walking around the waterfront.   The salads were tasty, as well as the bread.  The entrees were disappointing.  My veal was bitter and his pasta dish     lacked flavor.  The pasta was not even cooked enough.   The service was okay.  We won't go there again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you want Italian food, real Italian food in Phoenix, this is the place to go. Ambiance was really good, the wait staff was incredible. I had the osso bucco  which is almost better than the tiramisu! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Holy cow ce the bartender is amazing!!!!every flippin time i come here he always makes amazing drinks.also the food is amazing.i love it here so much and cant wait till my next visit!"}
{"text":"Never again. First time here. The food  was extremely over priced and not worth the $. I had the pasta with ragu/sausage and while the sauce was alright, there was hardly any sausage. At $25 it should have been loaded. Others in my party ordered the scallops, which were tiny and squid ink infused pasta, which had no taste and was bland. That plate was $45!! Another ordered the veal and it was paper thin. The mussels were in a watery, tasteless sauce. The bread was so small, you'd think they were a relative to Melba toast. If this is first class dining...then you can have it! I work hard for my money and will never throw it away on mediocre cuisine such as this place. We went out later and had pizza and fro-yo which actually turned out to be the highlight of our night! BTW, we should have known better when we walked in, there wasn't a single customer in the place! Oh well an expensive lesson learned."}
{"text":"Overpriced entrees, underwhelming food. My wife and I made a trip to Scottsdale to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring. We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place. Owned by Italians, homemade pastas -- sounded right up our alley. Unfortunately, we were significantly disappointed. We both had pasta specials (I had the parpadelle w/ lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w/ half a lobster, clams and mussels). I'm not one to complain about prices but I do have a problem with places charging big prices only to severely miss the mark on flavor. The parpadelle and squid ink pasta were $40 and $50 respectively. The parpadelle is a dish that even the swankiest restaurants in NYC charge $20 at most for. The squid ink claimed to have \"1/2 of a whole lobster\" but we could only find a few bits of overcooked tail in it. Skimping on the lobster left a terrible impression with me and led me to believe that they're pulling a fast one on us. This feeling was further validated after the waiter came by to inform us that he asked the chef to remove the meat from the shell so \"the lady wouldn't have to get her hands dirty.\" When the dish came, we were shocked when we didn't find an ounce of claw meat in the dish.   Finally, but most importantly, the flavor. The parpadelle was decent but the \"fresh, homemade pasta\" was way too thick. About twice the thickness that I've ever eaten (in even the crappiest of places). The thickness of the pasta coupled with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finished the noodles in the sauce left both dishes very unbalanced. Heavy on the pasta -- even though they had a heavy handed approach to the sauce.  Aside from the pastas, we had the cheesecake and gelato - both of which were more disappointing than the pastas.   The cherry on the top? The cheesy lounge singing performer at dinner. Really? Am I in a vegas lounge? Save the money and your palette. I'm sure there are other excellent places in Scottsdale -- I was only hoping Marcellino's was one of them. Unfortunately, it wasn't and the only folks benefitting are the owners that should be ashamed of the dishes they're putting out there."}
{"text":"Have been here few times now and food is always yummy and fresh! Great place for dinner dates! Although it was a Friday and they did not have a live band there was a band in barrio queen patio that just made night great! I really enjoyed caprese salad, pulled mozzarella , branzino, porcini pasta paired with sauvignon and peach pure proseco. Lastly, we ate tiramisu and had latte! Everything was delicious and waitress was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"I was impressed how nice the restaurant looked, it was very pretty.  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and seated at a nice table.  Our waitress, Vita, was perfect example of what all wait staff should model themselves after.  She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and was very energetic and enthusiastic.  If the owners of Marcellino read this, all I can say is, \"NEVER LET HER GO!\"  OK with that being said, we ordered the mussels appetizer and the pesto scallop appetizer.  They were good.  The mussels were on the large size and a little tough, but all and all they were good.  The scallops were luke warm in the middle, but still not too cold to eat.  I expected more out of the pesto, it was a little flat on flavor.  They also served us some nice bread with a little red dipping sauce.  It was a nice departure for balsamic and olive oil.  It went well with our wine. Moving on to the entrée, we ordered one of the specials to share, the Fettuccine Santa Lucia.  Fresh made pasta Infused with the ink from the cuttle fish.  It came in a spicy red sauce sautéed with mussels, clams, and calamari.  They state that it is served with  1/2 of a 1  1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster in shell, but the waitress said they would remove it from the shell for us.  So I was on board with that!  The entrée was very good, again the mussels were on the tough side but the clams were perfect.  The lobster was sadly overcooked.  The pasta was nice.  We did enjoy that part, but I wish we would have ordered the Tortelloni that was stuffed with Filet mignon and sautéed vegetables.  I think maybe it is not a good time for mussels right now and possibly a vendor/supplier issue?  I had a bad experience with them at a different establishment last week, but that is a different review.  We were so full, we couldn't even think about dessert!  I am sure they were awesome.  We finished out our meal by sipping on limoncello.  Very nice.  This was an enjoyable experience and we will go back.  I have to try that Tortelloni!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal here. Top 3 Italian meals ever. Great service and homemade pastas. Worth the price of admission"}
{"text":"Best Gnocchi and meat sauce i've ever had.   A friend of mine, who's  a friend of Sima and Marcellino brought me here.  I'm always apprehensive about trying something new when it comes to Italian food.. but so glad I did.  They make everyone feel welcome and well taken cared of.  The servers posses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of their food offerings.  The ambiance is very nice, who knew it was in a strip mall?  My experiences are from 2006, so I'm a little late to the review table, but I had to throw my 2 cents in.  Once you get over the slight sticker shock, you will definitely contemplate how soon your return will be.  Only bummer is I believe they close during the summer months."}
{"text":"Just wow! I heard about Marcellino Ristorante from a food blog I follow and it was nothing short of a fantastic meal. The atmosphere was beautiful and inviting, and the staff were all very friendly. Admittedly, the prices are expensive, but what attracted me to the restaurant was the hand crafted pasta. My favorite food is Italian, so I had to try Marcellino's! The chef even greeted our table at the end of the meal and was a great host. Another surprising part was the dessert. It is served with a flaming sugar cube that gives an extra little detail to a delicious end of meal. I ordered the tiramisu which was to die for. A great place for any intimate dinner setting or a celebratory meal. Will be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend and parents. Perfect restaurant for introducing her to the parents. Great food and service. We went Saturday night and there was live music -- volume was good and did not interfere with conversation. Strongly recommend this place. The pastas are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this restaurant for a while.  I decided to take my wife to celebrate a special occasion.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service was very good.  Everything on the menu is overpriced.    The homemade pasta is fresh and perfectly cooked.  The flavor of the pasta dishes we ordered were good, but not great.  I ordered the pappardelle in a lamb ragu.  Ragu was salty.  My wife ordered the linguini with lobster.  Lobster was a bit rubbery and dish had very little flavor.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Delightful!  Evening spectacular dish was Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli with Steak Butter Sauce. Amazing!  Entertainment by Monte Procopio, fabulous vocals and music.  Food, fun, music that you know the words, elegant evening!"}
{"text":"The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews here and decided to go and check it out. I had dinner there with my department and a  vendor i do a lot of business with. It was kind of a turn off showing up to a ratted down strip mall, but the inside decor was very nice. Eating there Thursday night, we were probably 1 table of out of 5. Not very busy. The portions were a nice size so your not overwhelmed, but its not all that its cracked up to be. We all had something different off the home made pasta menu. I did recommend it to a few other people who tried it, and they all seemed to be in agreement. Its just ok. I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Two of us went in on a Saturday night for dinner and a drink. First of all they cannot correctly mix even a simple drink like whiskey sour. I sent it back twice and gave up  They were fairly busy and badly understaffed so of course service was poor and VERY slow  The worse part was actually our food. We both ordered a pasta dish and had to add salt, pepper and red pepper. ANYTHING to try and get some flavor. The portions were VERY small and quite overpriced. I am 2nd generation Italian and know GOOD Italian food....this aint it folks!  Not the worse we have had, but probably the most disappointing $100 for two Italian meal We have ever had. 3 stars is being very generous"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant by accident last weekend. It ended up being a rather happy accident for us, which I hadn't anticipated based on reading the menu. To be honest, I read it and nothing really jumped out at me, but we were hungry and decided to try it out anyway.  Everything changed after our waiter brought out the platter of that day's made in house pasta specials. There were about ten different dishes, and every single one sounded fantastic!  I got a pasta dish with sundried tomato noodles, scallops and shrimp in a spicy red sauce. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!  My husband loved his pasta as well. Definitely a very pricey meal, but it was one that we walked out feeling okay about because it was so good."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's day and it was a good restaurant but not great if you want to compare it to some of the top restaurants in town.  The appetizers and entrees are good.  I would recommend the pastas since they are fresh and handmade.  The service and atmosphere were nice but for what I'm paying I could think of a few other restaurants that I would have better overall experiences at."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious, FRESH pasta a culinary pleasure. A must on your schedule of restaurants to visit in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow! I had such a hankering for Italian food, and Marcellino's treated me far beyond expectations. Growing up right outside of Boston, I went to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) quite a bit for authentic Italian food. I was skeptical as to what an Scottsdale authentic Italian restaurant would be. My first impression of Marcellino's was superb. A very somber and intimate setting. And listening to live entertainment. Already I was impressed.  For the life of me I cannot remember my servers name and I that's a let down because he was superb!! He made me and my company's night all the more enjoyable with his personality and his knowledge of the menu. What happened next was something that I have never seen before and it really added a class act to my experience here. He came to our table with a plate full of the pastas that were made for the day, with a detailed explanation of each type. Very impressive. He also went over each special of the night in great detail, leaving me with no questions to ask him.  After several minutes of glaring at the menu, and thinking about the dinner specials offered, I went with the dinner special of Lamb Ragu over Pappardelle.  My counterpart ordered their Fettuccine Contadina from their Handmade Pasta selection. After several more minutes of conversation and eating bread with a roasted red pepper spread, which was to die for, our meals came to us piping hot, and smelling of ecstasy.  My first bite, I was in love! This was incredibly good. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente, and who does not love freshly made pasta?! My Lamb Ragu was divine. I could have eaten about three plates of this dish myself, it was that good. My friends dish was also superb. Again freshly made pasta, with top quality produce, not overly done, which is the Italian way. Keep it simple. Although I didn't get a chance to have dessert, because I was stuffed from bread and pasta, I did see several desserts trailing through the dining room. They all looked to die for.  Marcellino's totally exceeded my expectations for authentic Italian food. I see too many Italian restaurants which typically serve all the same items, i.e. Chicken, Veal, Eggplant Parmesans, and Marsalas, but Marcellino's didn't offer these which was a sigh of relief, and makes me intrigued on going back and trying the other delights that they offer.  I would say that this place would be more suited for a date atmosphere than for big groups. It has a sexy, intimate vibe to it. Feel free to disagree with me on that. With all that being said, I will be back again, REAL soon! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My date probably would of gave this place 5 stars.  He talked it up for months about how amazing it was.  There were parts of it that were great.  The presentation of the pastas and explanation of them by the server to begin with were very helpful in deciding our main entrees.          The live music I think is what did it for me.  She was amazing and not too loud that we couldn't talk.  The ambiance of the whole place was so romantic.  The only reason why I gave it four stars was because at any restaurant, when ordering a bottle of wine, I've never actually had my glass be empty and had to literally stand up and grab the bottle to pour it for my date and I.  You would think someone would have seen by the second time, and offered to pour it for us.  I'm not beneath pouring my own wine but I'm out to be taken care of.  Oh and the chicken was a bit dry. But other than those two little things, everything else was great.      I'd go back if asked or invited but it's not a place where Id bring up in conversation to go."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best Italian food I have ever eaten in my entire life. Every single detail of each course was the best Italian food I have eaten in my 29 years on this earth. I will be back again and again and again and again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.   Black ink pasta with seafood is delicious.  Try the mozzarella with tomatoes.  Parking can be a little challenging but there are valet options close."}
{"text":"I do not understand how this restaurant has such high rating anywhere! I am Italian and LOVE good Italian food and make it homemade myself... I took my boyfriend to Marcellino for his Birthday and was thoroughly disappointed in almost EVERYTHING!  First, on a positive note, it is a beautiful location and great atmosphere... Perfect for a romantic date. Second, the negative... I do not know how they managed to make a salad taste bad, but they did... It tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation. Then their pasta... There was no flavor or depth or excitement at all! I don't know about you, but Italian food is supposed to warm you from the inside out and fulfill all your senses from sight to smell and of course taste! When we finished the meal, the waiter asked us how it was, and I told him I really was not impressed and disappointed after expecting something much more. He quickly got defensive and proceeded to quote all the \"awards\" and \"ratings\" they have received and when I mentioned I was Italian, he said the food I was used to but be from a different region. He was rude and un-accommodating.  I have no problem paying $20-$30 per plate, but only if there is quality to back it up. Do not waste your time or money if you are anticipating FABULOUS Italian food, but if you don't mind paying for a nice atmosphere and mediocre, overpriced food, then Marcellino might be your place."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times in the past. It's been several months since our last dining experience here. Some things have changed. What's the story with the bread/rolls? Italian restaurants are usually known for their great bread. But this has been changed to sliced Italian bread toasted. Heaven forbid if you request more as it takes forever. Just sad that they decided to save a few pennies on bread.  Two of our party ordered Gnocchi Sorren and again there's a cutback-the small portion was even smaller for this visit. I recommend skipping the appetizers as these have been changed. The Caprese-IN THE PAST-had big slices of tomato but this time it was several small tomatoes which was a disappointment at best. The Buffalo Mozzarella was also smaller and just not worth the cost.  Another person ordered the Pappardelle which was ok. The last person ordered the Strozzaprete ai Broccoli which was good. I think it will be some time before we return as this vist was a disappointment that can be avoided by not returning."}
{"text":"Pasta was over cooked with no bite to it at all. Also $40 for a lamb ragu over fresh pappardelle is a bit much."}
{"text":"I was in town with the gf for the weekend and we went here for dinner on Friday evening, with a reservation on one of those apps. I couldn't believe we were lucky enough to have a table close enough to see the chef at work, which was pretty cool. Our server was a lot of fun, joked with us a bit, but was also knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu and the different pastas available that evening. We started with a shrimp & feta appetizer and I could not believe how much I enjoyed it. We then shared 2 half orders of special (off menu) pastas, and the Fagottino di Pollo. I wish there was more of the chicken entree because it was that good, but the amount of food we received was enough to leave us satisfied but not stuffed.  We will definitely be back the next time we visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Chef Marcellino has a true passion for cooking and it really comes through in his food. I haven't had a bad dish yet. Scallops in pesto, Gnocchi and an amazing selection of fresh made infused pastas. Staff is amazing and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Food is delicious...prices are high.....ambience good with the exception of Marvin Gaye music instead of italian...."}
{"text":"So we decided to come here for our fifth anniversary- kinda a big one if you ask me. I will say the food was delicious. We had the squid ink pasta with seafood and also the mushroom pasta with lobster. The food was delicious which is why this review gets two stars. But- I called well in advance to make this reservation, and told them it was a five year anniversary- and we were seated at possibly the worst table in the entire place. Not private, not romantic, in the middle of the restaurant in walk ways. And on top of that, we had our food come out BEFORE our bread basket came out. So imagine you're expecting a wonderful evening out with your fiancé to celebrate your fifth anniversary, and what you get is some pasta about ten minutes out, served at the worst table in the restaurant. Amazing food Marcellino, I'll give you that. But your customer service and attention to detail is atrocious."}
{"text":"This is the single best restaurant in Arizona. I have been here several times and it is consistently delicious. Eating at the chef's island is lots of fun, Chef Marcellino is great. The servers are on the ball. This restaurant is 5 star."}
{"text":"We were here for Valentine's Dinner  with a group on 02/11/17. The atmosphere was very nice and we all were excited for dinner. The food came out very slow and the service staff was horrible. At an average of $30 a plate you expect the service and the Food to be top notch. I have had better service from Denny's. The majority of our plates were average at best. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Friday night and the experience was amazing.    The ambiance was chic, cozy and friendly.  The staff were attentive and helpful.    The food was incredible.  From locally sourced ingredients to the hand made pasta , each meal was amazing.  The cocktails were also excellent.    Location is perfect.  In Old Scottsdale Across the street from a Jazz bar."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I'm Italian, and I'm always dismissive of Italian restaurants in the US. Well, I have to say that Ristorante Marcellino is now ranked #1 in my list of favorite places all up. The food (straccetti al tartufo, ravioli, gnocchi), the wine (red and white recommended by marcellino), the dessert (tartufo al cioccolato, tiramisu, ricotta cheese cake), the grappa, the limoncello and the passito, everything was just perfect and beyond my expectations. Marcellino, sei un genio culinario, grazie per l'ospitalità!"}
{"text":"First time i came here, the food was exceptional but the company was not LOL -  so came back to try it with better company :) A typical Italian staple with a-typical twist on food.  Food is always good. Wine List more than acceptable.  Options on handmade pasta are great. I wish they had more vegetarian options.  They will not allow substitutions on their specials. I wanted one of their hand made pastas with a difference sauce  - the one they offer has lobster on it -  and i dont eat fish. They refused. needless to say thats their choice and with a busy kitchen i can understand. I dont hold them accountable for that.  Their pricing is also great.  $250 for the two of us with drinks... not bad, back in Beverly Hills it would have been $500. Will be visiting this restaurant again and again."}
{"text":"Honestly not sure how this place got so many reviews .. My girlfriends and I didn't really enjoy our experience and the food just tasted blend . The hand crafted pasta were very disappointed , not much flavor .. also the filet mignon were so rough and chewy , too much sauce for our taste . Mostly everyone worked there were being very nice to us besides our server .. and the wine pairing with the meal was horrible choice ! Never had such bad red wine in my life , literally tasted  like water mixed cheap red wine ..  this place is way overrated.."}
{"text":"This restaurant had hardly anyone here for lunch today and I think I know why...the prices are too expensive.  All of the special pastas were $35-$38...for lunch!  The atmosphere is nice, the service was good and the food was tasty, but just too expensive!  Ended up splitting a spinach salad and a pasta and the portion was perfect for two!"}
{"text":"Pasta texture was great but nothing memorable about the sauce....won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Marcellino!   There is indoor and outdoor seating. I love the atmosphere. We had live music!   This was the best that I had while I was in the area. Sun-dried tomato pasta with shrimp!"}
{"text":"delicious! got the strappazata with broccoli rabe in a white wine sauce with slices of garlic.  noodles were white and orange colored which made it look pretty.  they were chewy and had great texture! it was loaded with broccoli rabe which was awesome! i love broccoli rabe!  simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good but way overrated.  The service is nothing special and the prices are astronomical for the quality and quantity of food that you get.  Don't get me wrong the food is good but when you put it all together it is just OK and you may be happier going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience Wait staff was fabulous,food and wine outstanding. Will recommend this for sure"}
{"text":"Leopald was a fantastic waiter who knew the menu and genuinely loved to share his insight on this delicious food, beverages, and the chef's story and accolades. A European style manner of serving (low pressure with an emphasis on providing a great culinary experience). From our water glasses constantly being refilled, wine being poured, to bringing out fresh silverware and side plates between courses was constantly being done without ever needing to ask. The service was GREAT. The current pasta specials were presented and what they were paired with was explained. Next time we will have to get the gnocchi. There were options for vegetarians, meat lovers, and seafood eaters. The desserts we tried were also very good. We went with a group of friends and the atmosphere was good for both groups or it could have also worked well for a date night. Just in case, I would recommend making a reservation because it started to get a little busy/fill up even on a Monday night. The location is great, a parking garage right below, and the ambience was very nice (not too casual, but not at all stuffy). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Italian cuisine, so naturally my boyfriend chose Italian for Valentine's Day! Busy busy busy atmosphere in oldtown Scottsdale for this special day, we got excited walking up to the door seeing how beautiful the decor was at Marcellino's. Now both my boyfriend and I have each worked in the Scottsdale restaurant industry for over 5+ years, and working on Valentine's Day stinks for sure, so we get that everyone isn't really in their \"best service moods\" but that shouldn't be an acceptable out for not caring about all the people who are about to spend a good amount of money on their special night out at your restaurant! At least fake a smile, and make us think that you care about our experience. Our reservation was at 6:45- we were seated promptly, but the hostess was \"blah\"... Not a word left her mouth on the walk/seating to our table. About 30 seconds after being sat, a man offered us a bottle of still water to begin with, he was very polite, and I was disappointed to find out he was only the busser/serving assistant because his welcome was probably the best part of our whole meal. Waitress walks up, \"Hello, what can I get you started to drink?\" No name, no suggestions for a bottle of wine or champagne, oh well. We ordered two cocktails along with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer to start. We were told that if we separated our order- aka start with the app, then our entrees are going to take a \"very long time to arrive\"... Um, okay, we are now feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Drinks come about 12 mins later, appetizer tasted like store bought cheese with a strip of prosciutto ($19.95 I believe, ugh?!), another \"blah\"... Entrees are ordered, the gnocchi (which was very good and full of flavor) and a seafood dish including some delicious frozen calamari... :/ Dessert and coffee were then offered, we figured it might be best to get a McDonald's ice cream cone on the way home and save the $14. As were waiting for the check to arrive, here comes my favorite server assistant again! He asked how our meals were, if he could clear our plates, etc. ALL while maintaining a smile. The only one I've seen all night. I wanted to give him a hug. All in all, $143 before gratuity for an average meal. No goodbye or thanks for coming in as we were leaving from the host stand/what looked to be a floor manager. We were pretty bummed with this whole experience. \"Blah\""}
{"text":"Went to Marcellino with a large dinging group (about 18 people).  We were seated promptly even though we didn't have a reservation.  Our waiter was very good about keeping all of our orders separate, and he was even able to prepare separate checks for each person in the party.  Excellent service. Restaurant was very dark, but from what I could see seemed to be nicely decorated.  It was not too noisy.  I had the Strozzaprete ai Broccoli di Rape.  The pasta was supposed to be two colors, but I had trouble seeing it in the dim dining room.  Although I couldn't see my food, I could taste it, and it did taste delicious!  The noodles were perfectly cooked and nicely chewy.  However, $22.95 seemed like a LOT of money for a bowl of pasta."}
{"text":"Insanely good food paired with top-notch service, ambiance and the loveliest hostess! Sima, Marcellino and the entire staff make this restaurant our favorite location for special occasions. Homemade everything - the pasta is always a favorite for us. We had our wedding dinner here, 5 years ago, with a small group of family and close friends and it was wonderful. Amazing servers really know their business and can recommend wine pairings and their favorite dishes.   The new location in Old Town Scottsdale is more convenient to where we live, though we were just as happy to drive a bit further to the original location. I've chosen \"dressy\" and \"not\" good for kids, only based on how we like to experience Marcellino's, though they are so welcoming and comfortable I'm sure casual dress and (well behaved!) kids would be just as welcome... if you tend to spoil your kids, that is."}
{"text":"This place is off the charts!  Awesome food, service, and ambiance.  I got the salmon and shared some of the spinach ravioli - killer combo!  Served us as a table of 12 and exceeded our expectations!  Don't forget the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Marcellino Ristorante is one of my favorite Italian restaurant  here in Scottsdale.   Their pasta are all hand made.  Number of their pasta dishes all came with truffles.  Their sun dried red pepper with egg plant puree spread for the bread is so tasty..  The food here is authentic and delicious.   I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. The fresh pasta is incredible. The atmosphere inside and out is great for groups or romantic dinners. We had the black truffle filet ravioli and it was unbelievable."}
{"text":"I dined here a couple of weeks ago for a friends birthday. I have to admit that the thought of handmade pasta had me all excited. I thought the atmosphere was nice although it was a tad dark in there...I do actually like to see my food. I found the display of dishes that they bring to your table kind of weird...I don't need to see it...just describe it to me. I also felt like having 6 specials to go over is a bit much...I'm not huge on lengthy waiter/diner interaction - I go to restaurants with either my boyfriend or family or friends and that's who I want to talk to. I'm always polite and I tip well but I don't want to spend all of my time hearing about the menu.   As for the food - I have absolutely  no doubt that they use the highest quality ingredients. I had the gnocchi and while it was obviously  made well the flavor didn't blow me away. Potato dumplings are not exactly bursting with flavor so you need a sauce that tastes awesome - this was just a basic marinara and some mozzarella mixed in. I honestly far preferred the gnocchi dish they served at PastaBar downtown...I have not found anything that compares.   Obviously this is a good restaurant and I don't mean to take away from that but for me it just wasn't a hit - especially considering the cost."}
{"text":"Definitely an amazing restaurant, Sima and Chef Marcellino took great care of me and my date. The atmosphere is plush and romantic, i had the chef's tasting menu. Their hand made pasta is absolutely delicious.  Also on either Friday or Saturdays, they have live Opra at the restaurant which is an amazing treat."}
{"text":"This place has good italian food for phoenix, but thats because the only real competition is Olive Garden and Carabbas. If this place were any place else like San Fran it would be done. I mean $30 - 40 for pasta? Come on now... Way overpriced and not that tasty."}
{"text":"The concierge at the Hotel Valley Ho told us that this was one of the finer and better Italian restaurants in Town - she was right.  Having dined around the world, this is by far in my top 5 of all time Italian restaurants.  1. Atmosphere - cozy, intimate and great Italian music 2. Fresh made pasta - do I need to say more 3. A wine list that rivals any 5 star hotel selection 4. Service, Service, Service - Phenomenal wait staff 5. The Chef - Marcellino knows his stuff, great character.  Tips - Ink infused fettuccine with Lobster is probably the best dish I have had in years. Order the rare but 100 point Barollo - It is worth the $ 200.00 a bottle.  But again - service, service, service.  Finally a restaurant that does everything right."}
{"text":"Simply a fantastic meal.  Great service.  Excellent chianti.  Perfect tiramisu.  One of the best dinners I've had in the Valley."}
{"text":"Expertly crafted fresh pasta is always a joy.  I went to Marcellino's this past weekend with my wife and some close friends and I have to say the evening was an experience.  Everything about this place screamed romantic Italian dinner from the live music to the tucked away location set back behind Barrio Queen in Old Town.  In many ways the presentation is a throwback to decadent dining where they bring you a view plate of the pasta before the meal while the well trained waiter tells the story of each type of noodle and the delicious dish its served with.  It's something that I enjoy because it reminds me that I'm dining out, and this is a meal that isn't to be rushed.  The food they make here takes time and should be enjoyed accordingly and slowly perhaps with an accompaniment of a few bottles of carefully selected Italian wine. I ended up going with the squid ink pasta with muscles, clams, and half lobster tail in a flavorful red sauce.  In my opinion they had me at squid ink, but beyond that everything was quality, and the juice from the fresh clams and muscles gave a nice seafood flavor to the sauce.  Pricing is what you should expect for the ambience and quality of food.  I could see myself coming here every few months because the pasta, and the fact that the chef/owner took the time to come out and ask us how our meal was.  It shows that he truly cares and that he's confident in the product that he's turning out."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago with 3 co-workers and loved everything about the experience. We had several pasta of the day choices and were pleased with all of them. The limoncella was excellent and house made. Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"By far, THE best Italian food, wine, beer, etc. that I have ever tasted in my life. My wife and I enjoy the food every single time. Food has been perfect every single order -- consistently over months of visiting. Marcellino's will not let you down and will meet your expectations...and then some. Great staff who are very menu savvy and the customer service is superb."}
{"text":"Went here on the basis of the reviews on this site for our anniversary (thanks Gabi).  It was a perfect choice.  From the reservation process, through the parking, to the live band playing just outside, the beginning of the evening was perfect.  Once inside the ambience was excellent.  Their was an intimacy to the venue which was, for fear of being redundent, excellent.  The hosts were friendly and attentive, and our server, Scott, was wonderful.  And the food.  Wow.  We actually ordered two of the specials, and they were amazing... my wife had a pasta dish in a lobster sauce which was perfect... thought she was going to lick her plate at the end.  I had the ground steak gnocchi, which was cooked to perfection.  Both were simply delicious.  They had a very nice wine selection (we had the prosecco), and the espresso which topped the evening off was again, perfect.  This is definitely on my short list of the best restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and atmosphere.  A little pricey for the pastas but homemade and worth it!"}
{"text":"By far and away the best Italian food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.   I have been going to this restaurant for the longesdt time and will not eat Italian food anywhere else. Pasta made fresh every day and knowledgable and attentive workers around to make certain everything is perfect. Make a reservation and be sure to be there on Saturday nights as the live music will make you want to stay for hours.  The singer has a fantastic voice with great traditional songs"}
{"text":"Love this place ! The owners are very friendly and make you feel welcome. It feels like you're in a NYC Italian restaurant. :-) Food is creative and delicious . Service is great. We keep coming back !  You really should try it.  Either as a couple or as a group - this place works."}
{"text":"Marcellino Ristorante is a truly excellent Italian restaurant. There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Clean, upscale place for a meal.  Nothing was outstanding.  Fresh pasta with red bell pepper, shrimp and scallops was a bit \"fishy\" and just ok. Flatline. Indifferent. Overpriced.  The wine list was limited, but perhaps because of its exclusive Italian-only wines. Dessert just ok. Jazz band had an ear piercing singer--so couldn't hear conversation at our table.  Restroom auto-on faucet didn't work right so had a hard time getting soap off my hands. Service good until the end....took a while to clear off our dirty plates.  Don't think I'd return but not a bad place."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner at Marcellino's last night.  Everything was perfect, including a Grey Goose Martini!  The waiter was very efficient, came by our table just the right amount of time.  We shared a Caprese antipasto.  Wonderful!.  Then shared a pasta dish that wasn't on the menu.  It was a large, flat-squared pasta with an amazing truffle sauce.  To die for!  For our main course we also shared the Scaloppine al Gorgonzola.  Absolutely fantastic.  Dinner would not be complete without a wonderful Tiramisu!  Today I fast!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Marcellino at least 5 times in the last two years, the most recent visit in October.    The only thing that keeps me from giving Marcellino 5 stars is my spotty experience with the service.  On two occasions it took more than 30 minutes to get a check when we were ready; on another the owner/hostess was condescending.    The food has always been spectaular- 5 stars for the food.  The pasta and fillings are all freshly made.  Among our favorites: Paccatelli al Ragu di Salsiccia- this is one that my daughter has identified as the best Ragu in Phoenix; Gnocchi Sorrentina - the most dreamy-creamy gnocci dish; Lamb Chops al Balsamico- lamb can be sublime or awful- this was memorably sublime.  The salad with the pears and the Ortolana con Gamberi salad are also excellent.  The waiter's service was impeccible at my most recent visit~ attentive, knowledgable, professional and friendly.  I am pleased this was the case as I was hesitant to go because of my previous  experience with the staff.  On one occasion I brought one well-behaved child, on another brought two well-behaved children who enjoy dining.  It was the day I brought two children that I encountered the owner/hostess.  I arrived around 5pm (early- before the usual dinner crowd), and my children behaved perfectly (or I would not have taken them out).  The waiter was charming and attentive, but I felt that the owner/hostess was displeased that I brought children (who at the time were 9 and 10).  I paid full price for all entrees, didn't ask for special kid favors,  tip well and don't dawdle, and the kids were very quiet, so I was rather off-put that I would be be treated with veiled contempt.  I am sure that I will return at some point.  I woud advise the owners to consider tightening up their service, providing checks promptly, treating all guests with gracious respect, putting on the \"make nice\" smile when necessary.  Don't give a \"bum's rush\" to a customer with children who are behaving appropriately."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant but be careful what you order as it can be expensive. I've dined at some of the best restaurants in the world but don't think I've seen a $50 pasta dish before."}
{"text":"These people are absolutely rude! I've been sitting here for 20 minutes and all I've gotten are dirty looks. They're discriminatory and absolutely classless! The servers, Linda and Tanya are awful! The redeeming quality is Mickey! She was perfect! Seriously; will not be taking any friends to this rude discriminatory place."}
{"text":"Third time to this restaurant...first was as a visitor to the area, last two as a resident.  We ended up here last night on Valentine's Day after deciding to leave our previous restaurant due to the food being cold and service lacking, very glad we did.  As usual we sat at the bar and had our meal there, such a great environment and service is always personable and approachable.  You can't go wrong coming here to eat...the pasta is fresh and options are wonderful, they know what they are doing and you get that true old school, high end, yet relaxed Italian feel, thanks as always!"}
{"text":"We heard about Marcellino from a hotel consierge and wondered if it would be as nice as it was described... punch line, it was and I recommend it for anyone who like great, authentic Italian cuisine - the food was terrific, the service was top notch, and Marcellino is a wonderful person. He doesn't pander to people; instead he understands the beauty of well-prepared food and hopes people will discover this for themselves"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Great bartender!  Food was overpriced for pasta. We sat on the patio and were surprised by the fact that a dog ran into the restaurant (not a service dog) and then the owner picked it up and was seated on the patio.  The owner of the dog processed to kiss the dog at the table tongue and all.  It was unsettling lucky we had already finished our meals.  Very odd that an upscale Scottsdale restaurant would allow this.  We would probably not go back"}
{"text":"The FOODwas good! My friends ordered the Filet Mignon with median rare and Lamb Chop; they were awesome! Their homemade pasta special was impressive as well. We also had a bottle of white wine that the waiter introduced to us. The wine was very good just that i can't remember the name of it :P Also, we celebrated for one of the friends' birthday today! The restaurant was really thoughtful that they personalized our dessert for our birthday girl:) Wonderful SERVICE! Other than the delicious food and birthday cake, I love the service that Marcellino Ristoante had! Their waiter was really professional when introducing the food and recommending the wine. The AMBIANCE was really good for special occasion like birthday, anniversary or date =)"}
{"text":"I took my wife and 2 year old here on a whim one day.  They were very nice to us and very happy to seat us with a kid, which in a nice restaurant is always great not to get a dirty look.  The waiter offered to do a half pasta for my little guy.  We loved the pasta.  I had one with braised beef that was so good.  My wife got a mushroom truffle pasta it was amazing.  My little guys gnocchi was a little fancy for him but he are them happily.  All the pasta is home made here.  My wife said it's her new favorite nice iris loan restaurant.   If you're looking for a date night this place is perfect.  Also I forgot to fill out the tip and sign and they came and found me!   I really appreciated them trying to find me instead if just adding whatever tip they wanted.   Great service.  Food came out quickly, and we were extremely impressed.   We're from NJ and NY so good Italian comes at a premium in AZ.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Date nite, never been there and was pleasantly surprised...authentic Italian was so good and a bottle of wine, Paula and Justin were right on it.  I'd recommend it if you want good Italian food."}
{"text":"Brilliant - Server Scott was all over us! Fresh made pasta - ambiance perfect. Would go back again and again! Thank Chef, Scott and staff! I hope the translation is correct, That was Wonderful! Che è stato meraviglioso!!!"}
{"text":"We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner.  The room was not ready, the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians), the A/V equipment didn't work.   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broth...the owner came back with some excuse for this, but the issue was not corrected.  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return."}
{"text":"Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.  I was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives."}
{"text":"This was the second time that I visited Marcellino and it did not disappoint. Went here with my fiancé and my dad and we all enjoyed the delicious food and amazing service from our waiter Leo and all of the staff. Started off with the mussels and burrata infused with black truffles which had really awesome flavor. Entrees included  lamb pappardelle, squid ink lobster/seafood pasta and a porcini mushroom pasta with lobster. All pastas had great texture and the meat/seafood was very tasty as well. Finished the night with cheesecake and another baked apple desert with a hazelnut ice cream on top. Overall, come for the food but stay for the great service! Great job Marcellino!"}
{"text":"Ate here on vacation and had the most amazing experience. We were able to get a table right away outside and the patio has a great vibe and atmosphere. The food and wine was incredible. Gluten free friendly and wonderful staff. We will be back! Tony was awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fresh made pasta was awesome, will definitely return. Your hostess had a less then friendly greeting when we arrived to a less then half full restaurant with a \"you don't have a reservation? Well let me see if there is anything we can put together for you\" comment. Looking thought reviews it seems as though this is a familiar issue. I would have given a 5 star if the staff was more friendly and welcoming. Kitchen is outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"Was here last night and once I heard the chef was from Italy, I knew we were in good hands. Our server, Vita, was SO knowledgable about the food. When she was going through the pasta specials (pasta made in house and on display on a plate that Vita was showing us) we were absolutely shocked at the amount of detail of ingredients she was able to remember and sell us on. We chose the spinach ricotta ravioli that came with a light butter sauce and my boyfriend chose a pasta with portobello mushrooms and lobster, also came with a light sauce. The food was to die for!!! As for dessert, the tiramisu came out with a flaming sugar cube on the side, it was plated beautifully. I was expecting to be blown away but the tiramisu didn't have enough marscapone and way too much cocoa powder (totally my opinion-does NOT take away from the quality or deliciousness of the food). All in all-these people are doing a fantastic job. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was bad. The waiter was hard to find and we were 5 couples celebrating 3 anniversaries.  The waiter ignored our requests for bread 3 times. I even told him I would pay for it and he still ignored our request.  I had to get up and speak to the manager about it of which she assisted, but then the bread service stopped again after she stopped getting involved..  Not happy about paying a tip for such poor service..Will not go back..."}
{"text":"Had feared that after moving to chic Scottsdale the food would suffer.  Thankfully that is not the case.  I love their pasta.  I don't even bother with the proteins, it is the pasta that is the star.  The crowd tends to skew a little older, (i.e. not the best place to that your fraternity brother), and even a first date might be a little off-putting.  In fact, you should probably confirm you like the person since the prices are a little steep.  But if you are willing to make the time and money commitment, there is no better place in town for wonderful fresh pasta that is toothsome and delicious.  The sauces lovingly envelope each bite and never overwhelms.  Bread is served and it is good, but do not fill up on bread no matter how much you like the eggplant spread that comes with it.  Come hungry, leave happy.  I'm still smiling."}
{"text":"That's right, it is woohoo as good as it gets!  This place is perfect for a celebration dinner with some special people.  After it was over, I wanted to bring everyone I love here to have a great experience - it's that freaking good!  The food was excellent.  The table shared some mozzarella & prosciutto and caprese.  I had the scialatielli alle vongole, the handmade pasta was out of this world delicious and top it off with amazing clams *drool*.  Oh, I can't forget the wine, the wine was actually the best part believe it or not, I can't recall all the names because like I said, it was a celebration dinner, but one stuck out \"CUM LAUDE\" haha, it still makes me giggle.  The service was also excellent, that coupled with the romantic decor and ambiance make this a 5 star dinning establishment, well, in my opinion anyway."}
{"text":"The food was good but don't go on a Thursday or Saturday if you want to converse with your guests, the music drowns out any conversation."}
{"text":"I was with a very large group that they handled very well.  Each most of us ordered one of the specials and all were great with freshly made pasta.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID  Cold scallops followed after a very long wait by hardly cooked lukewarm pasta. Even though they took it off the bill they wanted to charge two bottles of wine even though we only had one."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my most favorite Italian restaurants in Scottsdale.   What I like about this place is their pastas are all handcraft daily.  My favorite pasta is their ribbon pasta. It is exquisite!  That being said my most favorite dish is their gnocchi.....   I have been to some of the finest Italian restaurants throughout the US, Europe and I frequent Italy often.  This is the best and I would suggest everyone to try it."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Marcellino for many years but never made it over there when they were in Phoenix.  My friends and I decided to check them out this last Saturday.  This is my third visit to the space that previously was occupied by Digestif, Tutto and now Marcellino.  Luckily for Fred Unger, he probably has a tenant here who will make it.    They changed the entrance and once I found my way in I was reminded what a great space this room is.  The exposed brick, dark colors and candlelight are very romantic.  Once seated we tasted a few wines and decided on a nice Barbera reasonably priced at $47 for the bottle.  Our appetizer was a bufalo mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with tomato and basil.  It was a delicious start to the meal.  Since there were four of us we all decided to order something different so that we could all try each other's dish.  They show you the different pastas and explain the specials of the day.  Literally, all of the specials sounded great and it was tough to make a decision.  I ordered the porcini fettuccine which came with lobster.  Who doesn't like lobster but actually the pasta stole the show.  It was a real earthy, rich flavor that I loved.  The other dish that really stood out to me was the filet mignon and truffle tortelloni.  How can you go wrong with those ingredients?  To top off the evening they had live opera singers entertaining during dinner.  I've read people complain about the prices at Marcellino but I really don't agree.  Our bill was $207 plus tax and tip for four people.  For a topnotch meal with wine it was worth every penny to our group."}
{"text":"The food was under seasoned, over priced and not worth it. The food sounded way better than it tasted. The pasta was over cooked, lacked salt and pepper or anything unique. Almost tasted like a bottled sauce. And they were unwilling to modify the dishes"}
{"text":"My Wonderful husband took me here for our Anniversary! I had never been to, nor heard of Marcellino's Resterante. I was thoroughly impressed with how impeccable and authentic the food was, but also how accommodating  and meaningful they made the entire experience.They made our special occasion into an unforgettable event!"}
{"text":"If you like true Italian food, this is the place for you. Every day they serve a different selection of homemade pastas, which are incredible. Their gnocchi and paccatelli are personal favorites but each of their pastas is very good. Try this place and take your taste buds to Italy - you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Marcellino Ristorante in Old Town Scottsdale is one of my favorite restaurants! :)   My boyfriend & I went here on Saturday night and not only had an amazing dinner but another overall amazing experience!  Before dinner, we sat up at the bar where we had a few glasses of wine. Our bartender, Lou, took the time to get to know my name and made sure that my glass of wine was always full. It is evident that he truly cares about his customers and his restaurant.  For dinner, we started with the Imported Buffalo Mozzarella & Prosciutto appetizer. It was a generous portion and was wonderful. The ingredients are always fresh and it was the perfect way to start off our meal. (I'd say this is perfect for two people to share, unless you are really hungry!)  My boyfriend had the Santa Lucia for his main entree. It was delicious- And yes, he was generous enough to share. It is a \"Black cuttle fish ink infused fettuccine sautéed with muscles, clams and calamari in a lightly spiced tomato sauce and topped with half of a 1 1/2 pound fresh Maine lobster.\" (I took this off their website because I decided my description could not do it justice.) It was an absolutely incredible dish- One not to be missed!  My dish was fairly similar to the Santa Lucia but not as big. Unfortunately the name is escaping me at the moment but it is a spicy tomato sauce with shrimp, fresh fish and calamari. It is phenomenal and worth every carb ;)  Our servers were both Rob & Johnny. They provided outstanding guest service! Oh and since it was a Saturday night, there was live entertainment. Some might consider the entertainer to be a \"cheesy lounge singer\" but I thought he was really good and put some romance (and laughs) in to our evening... Watching my boyfriend imitate and sing \"At Last\" to me was priceless.   Overall, if you are looking for an authentic Italian dinner with incredible service and owners that really care about their restaurant, I'd say come to Marcellino Ristorante! You'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews I expected to be wowed.  It is a nice restaurant but noisy and our pasta was good but not as flavorful as I hoped. Great place for a typical night out but not for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I started going here when they were on Northern and haven't looked back.  I'm not sure why they have a menu as the star of the show is the fresh made pasta.  They bring it by on a plate and tell you what is fresh for the day .  Porcini infused with lobster is hard to pass up but sometimes they have squid ink with seafood which is my favorite.   Service and dessert are middle of the road but I'm there for the pasta!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled across this place while walking around downtown on a Friday night. It was the ambiance of the restaurant that attracted us, romatic, dimly lit with an outdoor patio. When we walked up to the hostess, we told her we did not have a reservation, though would like to sit for dinner. She was extremely rude, annoyed, and walked away. I actually looked at my husband and started to leave the restaurant, until the waiter nearby caught what happened and seated us on the patio.   The food was amazing-- the gnocchi was so soft and tender, best ever. My husband ordered some special mushroom infused pasta.. It was also delicious. I would definitely return, next time making sure I have a reservation I guess."}
{"text":"How can I not give Marcellino five stars?  The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.  From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)  We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!  Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.  All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.  So, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Best pasta I have ever had. Don't go there if you're looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! When making our reservation, we mentioned it was our early V Day date so when we arrived, our waiter had picked us a great table and served us complimentary Prosseco. Gnocchi was the best we ever had! Wine was delicious! Dessert was ok. Prices are high but the pasta is homemade and delicious and it was worth it!  The staff also had great knowledge of the emenu and made great suggestions! The atmosphere is romantic and classy!  We recommend having dinner here!!!!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming - good Italian food and atmosphere.  This is a place we will go back to!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD, EXCELLENT AMBIENCE, EXCELLENT SERVICE. As vegitarian who is 100% Italian, it's hard to find REAL Italian food with fresh outrageous ingredients. Well I found it here! It was obviously Marcellino -culinary artist as he is- has his finger on everything. I thought he must have studied the craft in Italy.  Went with my boyfriend for our anniversary and we ate on the lovely patio. I had the hand made Strozzaprette e Broccoli rabe. It was OUTSTANDING (never thought I would find Broccoli rabe in the valley!   We had such a lovely experience. This will definitely be our go-to for special occasions."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 18 for dinner Saturday night. Marcellino would personally come out from the kitchen after every course and"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food in Arizona.  And to boot, the waiters speak intelligently about the food and are polite.    The only reason this isn't getting a 5 start rating is because their isn't much value in the meal.  I understand that the intent or spirit of the restaurant isn't centered on value, but I the portions of the food are not congruent with the pricing."}
{"text":"The BF and I stopped here for lunch one day during the week.  There was only one other table there...and with so many of the other places nearby really busy, we were a little skeptical.  We were not disappointed!  The service was wonderful, the food was wonderful, the bread and dipping sauce they bring out is wonderful!  I think the reason it was so empty is because it is a bit pricy....for lunch.  We loved it though.  I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Short of making a trip to Italy, and very much like that trip, I did not want to leave. I had plans to eat at another place but for some reason was drawn to this gem. Most likely Because of the picture of the beautiful husband and wife on their website, I knew this would be the right choice.  Seated promptly I began asking questions about the wine, specifically the Amarone. Turns out the owner worked at Amorone in Nyc, a place where I have so many fond memories. As I looked around the restaurant I could see the similarities but taken far beyond with their own passion for life.  Pasta waits for no one! Any they have it, handmade and as you can see from my pictures, fantastic!  To start I had the carpaccio di manzo. The same as I used to eat at NYC but served with a greater passion. Thinly sliced, raw tenderloin blankets arugola topped with sliced fresh mushrooms, perfectly shaved Parmigiano and herbed lemon dressing to play games with your taste buds.  Before I left the owner told me the story of his wedding night in NYC, which is the picture he and I stand next to. I used to say, ONLY IN NEW YORK---and now ONLY NOW  in SCOTTSDALE.  Piano Piano"}
{"text":"I've been looking for that place in Scottsdale that is like cheers where everybody knows your name and the food is phenomenal.   I found it this trip at Marcellinos.  I dined here two nights in a row and had the best food and entertainment experience that I've had in Scottsdale. I had a chicken dish,  a seafood dish, and both experiences were amazing.I will be back every trip to Scottsdale that I make!! If you haven't been here you need to go."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic restaurant in the heart of old town Scottsdale, Marcellino's is it. The ambiance for dinner is intimate, dim lighting, the owners are there making sure you're happy, and on weekends there's live music, that's not too loud but adds a romantic backdrop to your night with love songs you'll recognize. Now, the food, hold on to your hats, everything is homemade, overseen by Marcellino himself! I had the beef filet ravioli, it will go down as one of my favorite pasta dishes or dinners for that matter, ever! I spent Valentine's Day there with Joe, it was beautiful. We recently went there with a group of good friends, we let the Italian wine flow, and laughed the night away."}
{"text":"as someone who is extremely picky about italian food, i have to give marcellino's high marks for some of the best pasta and tiramisu i've ever had! we ordered the off menu ravioli and tortellini dishes which were delicious and they were kind enough to let us split the entrees. the tiramisu was fantastic,, we almost ordered a second one! the only minor criticism we had was the service was a little slow we waited quite awhile for our bread, but other than that the beautiful patio and excellent food gave us an authentic italian experience"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by the food.  Very bland. .. no flavor.   I had the pork medallions and not only were they overcooked,  but almost not edible...no spices.  My husband had the seafood pasta.. again,  horrid with no flavor. . He had to add salt and a lot of cheese just to get it down.  Bread seemed old and the spread they served with it was also tasteless...we asked for butter and it tasted funny... something was just not right.   Upside was the wine. . Very good.   Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of dining at this restaurant because I was given a gift certificate. The dollar amount was quite high so I knew this will be a \"fine dining\" experience - one I probably would not rather pay for. I reviewed the menu and didn't see that the prices were that bad - so I invited my future in laws and future husband. When we got there, the restaurant was cozy and intimate. Right away, the employees were really nice. They asked us if we have ever dined before and we told them \"no\". They gave us complimentary bread and a small meat and cheese platter.   The waiter went over the specials and also brought over a pasta display - these were not on the menu and he had to verbally tell us about each - of which the prices were way more than the pasta dishes on the menu. I couldn't resist despite the prices - maybe it was his voice, the way he detailed the dishes, and the fact there was a display in front of us that made me forget the menu all together and order off of his verbal recommendations: my fubby and I shared the Buffalo Mozzarella for an appetizer, the Porcini Fettucini for an entree and I got the Bellinitini for my drink.  Everything was incredible - even the bread and I normally don't eat bread! When we got the check - for four of us, it was a little less than $200 ($50/person). Thank god for the gift certificate to help pay the bill and the fact that we shared!   Overall, atmosphere = 5, food = 5, service = 5, price = 2. It would be a great place to visit for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Marcellino's for awhile, but the last time we tried, it was closed as the owners were away in Italy.  Finally got around to a very overdue visit tonight.  Dinner was excellent. Started with a special app, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in proscuito served with roasted peppers, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes.  It was perfect.  The mozzarella tasted home-made.  Tried the mushroom linguine and red lingunie for entrees.  All of the pastas are made by hand in the restuarant.  Both dishes were very good.   Rounded out the perfect meal with a perfect slice of tiramisu.  They also gave a number of service items including, bruschetta with fresh tomatoes and basil before the app, and a shot of homemade limoncello with biscotti after desert.  With wine, it was about $65 pp which was reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious.  We came for Mother's Day and my family could not of picked a better place to celebrate.  The food and service was awesome all around.  Marcellino Ristorante is definitely a special occasion place it is expensive but worth every penny.  Nice touch at the end when they gave all mom's a free homemade dessert."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Italian place for a fancy night out or a nice dinner date, this is the place to go! Came here with my husband the day before the Phoenix marathon for some \"carb-loading,\" & boy I'm glad we did!! We made reservations for Friday night, which good thing we did because the place was packed! The service was great; our food came out hot and fresh, our water glasses were never more than half empty, and the server was very attentive & explained the menu & specials very well. We got fettuccine pasta with asparagus, as well as the steak ravioli and truffle pasta. I don't remember the exact names of everything, but it was all VERY good. I also ordered the \"Bellini-tini\" cocktail, and the caprese appetizer. The chef himself makes everything from scratch, and you can definitely tell from the taste and freshness of the food! Overall, it was a little on the expensive side, but very well worth it!"}
{"text":"I think Marcellino's will get a second chance for a special occasion.  I visited the restaurant based on seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Italian cuisine in the valley by far.  They're specialty handmade pasta is like nothing you've ever experienced before. To top it off Marcellino has perfected the chocolate cake. The ambiance, the food, the service it's all amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday earlier today. I hadn't heard of it but I saw something about it on yelp earlier that morning and decided to try it. The atmosphere was beautiful and the patio was adorable so we decided to sit outside. It wasn't busy at all and I probably didn't need a reservation for a Monday night. We ordered the scallops for an appetizer. I was shocked when the waiter brought it out because there was only 3 and the price was about $19. Honestly they were so rich and buttery you only need about two to feel satisfied. They were amazing!!! I got the gnocchi with red sauce and they were to die for. They were so rich and had little blobs of melted mozzarella all over. All their pasta is housemaid and fresh. My boyfriend got a pasta with shrimp and mushroom (can't remember the names because they were all Italian and super fancy) and he loved it. It came with a ton of shrimp which I was also surprised by! Overall I loved it and can't wait to return. Paola was our server and she is from Italy. She truly gave us a great experience especially by surprising us with flaming tiramisu at the end for his birthday. I hate tiramisu but it was honestly so creamy and delicious that I can't stop thinking about it! It was about $74 for the two of us but 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Great local Italian in old town Scottsdale. Always crowded, always fun. We were there March 10th during Giants spring training. Beautiful weather and lovely location. The food-- home made pasta specials each night in addition to the regular menu standbys-- actually it's a quite large menu loaded with options. Wife and I had carpaccio, burrata salad, and a wonderful pasta special. By the way, check the prices before you order-- our pasta special was $46 each. It was excellent nevertheless. Service very good even though they are barraged with a continuous stream of tourists. This is a fun place-- enjoy."}
{"text":"ok...so we had dinner here tonight based on all the fabulous reviews on this site. I have to wonder what all the posters were thinking. I'm sure these are all people who feel if something is expensive and overpriced, then that translates to exceptional.  First off, the service was almost non existent and the most I can say is that everyone we encountered from the hostess to the waiter who took our order, is that they were very cold and almost arrogant - the farthest thing from friendly service.  We ordered mussels in the red sauce as an appetizer. Very ordinary and the sauce had hardly any taste at all. Some of the mussels were actually empty shells.  Next we ordered the green salad with balsamic vinagerette. Really now, $10 for what amounted to  bag salad greens - with nothing else - accompanied with what i assume plain bottled dressing.  Our entrees weren't bad, but not great either - again, just ordinary. All in all, the entire meal was so mediocre, we didn't even want to mess with ordering dessert.  The \"ambiance\" was nothing to write home about..I really have to scratch my head at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.   Not terrible...just way overpriced for what it is...For their prices, I expected to have a phenomenal meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous Italian food. The special house made pastas are so good. I have the sun dried tomato pasta with shrimp and scallops. Slightly spicy sauce was delicious.   They have a short but well diverse wine list. The Italian wines are featured and delicious. There are some lower priced wines along with some extremely expensive choices.   The service is always top notch and the place has a very authentic Italian reel to it."}
{"text":"Update:  I appreciate the response, but the responder needs to do a little more research and cite their sources when claiming that food poisoning can only occur within a four hour window. Here is a helpful article that sheds light on the actual incubation times for food borne illness, which can definitely be caused by improper hygiene when preparing a salad and can take as long as 48 hours to appear:  http://www.buzzle.com/articles/incubation-period-for-food-poisoning.html"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very good service. The food is pretty average. Perhaps we are spoiled by our local Italian Restaurant, but the food is way over priced for the quality. The desserts are really nice. Gelato, Apple pastry, or the sorbet are ver nice. Probably won't go back next time we are in town since there are soooo many choices in the area."}
{"text":"Standard and no charm. Wine list is OK.  I get that the options in this neighborhood in Scottsdale are all going to be around the same: new construction, manufactured and heavily AC-ed Disney World restaurants,but I wish I opted for something a little less contrived. While our bus boy was very nice, our server seemed like he had better places to be every time he came over.  Ordered the gnocchi, which was fine but boring."}
{"text":"This is not your traditional Italian American restaurant.  You're not going to get an endless bowl of pasta, bread sticks or a basic marinara sauce. What you will get is fresh home made pasta, ethereal sauces, and a waitstaff that knows the menu.    After several visits and a boat load of money (this place ain't cheap), I'm a fan.  Today, we were served by Vita. I have rarely met a waitress that was more knowledeagble about the menu or the wine list.  My wife ordered the zuppe de pesce.  Let's just say that the bowl was empty and I could'nt get a piece of bread in there. It was off the charts.  I ordered the \"orange' pasta with shrimp and a light tomato sauce.  I couldn't get it into my mouth fast enough. The rest of our group was equally pleased.  So, why not five stars. This is totally stupid but at this price point, little things should be perfect.  Bread was good but over cooked. And here is my big (but so little that I'm embarrassed) butter with bread should have been softened to room temperature.  Don't miss this place.  Pasta is amazing, service is great.  Just serve fresher bread and softer butter."}

Your dining experience there will be private, personal and in a lovely atmosphere.  As a diner, you will feel like everything is especially for you.... and it is. Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return."}
{"text":"I agree with all the enthusiasts here.  The handmade PASTAS are AWESOME!!  So delish!!!  Too bad I live in LA!  I was driving through Phoenix and I'm so glad I stopped by!  I would definitely make another visit when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for our club's holiday lunch yesterday with about 20 people. Pleasing a group is always hard; this time every single guest had praise for the restaurant from food to service. Most ordered from the special lunch menu which offered a handful of different selections from starters to main course, including a glass of wine for $24 total. Not bad. I enjoyed the organic green salad, the gnocchi with tomato and mozzarella, and added the chocolate mousse. No complaints about the food. Minor complaint would be that the breadbasket delivered to our table had 4 small slices of hard baguette, not enough the serve our section of the table. I'm sure they would have delivered more if asked. Also another guest ordered chocolate mousse and his was twice the size of mine, delivered in an ice cream glass filled to the brim with mousse and whipped cream. Mine came in a small martini glass, so I felt a little annoyed by the rather large discrepancy between the desserts. Overall A+ experience with the restaurant letting us hang out for 3+ hours having lunch and our gift exchange."}
{"text":"Off the chart amazing!!! We went here for my birthday and it was literally the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at ( and I've eaten at my share in Italy). The ambiance was a soothing glow of gentle lighting and rustic brickwork, with Italian opera piped in. The food was a perfectly prepared collection of hand-made pastas in exotic flavors - cheese infused, squid ink colored, and wonderfully sauced. The desert was a just-right tiramisu - capping a delectable meal. Yes, it's a bit pricey - but TOTALLY worth it for special occasion food.  Oh - and come on Saturday evenings to get serenaded by live opera singers!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Old Town hands down. Homemade pasta here is the best and they have a variety of options."}
{"text":"The ambience here is wonderful and the food is pretty good, but it is extremely expensive for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Had a lovely NYE dinner here with family. Staff was courteous and professional. Dirty martini was great and decent size. Had the squid ink pasta which was okay. Live music was pleasant and not too loud."}
{"text":"As always.  Great service.  Fantastic food.  Great weather for seating in the outside patio and having an early dinner as the sun sets.  A definite favorite Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow good here. Private party soon here, so I have been given a time window for dinner. No problem. White Moscato now, Italian, is excellent. Sparkling water also. Have asked for pasta of sausage, tomatoes in marinara. Nice setting here and I'm actually outside seating area which is very nice. And can almost touch my parked bicycle!! $25 for 3 scallops was out of line high...anywhere. But everything was quite excellent and $115. Also quite enough!!"}
{"text":"Visited for Restaurant Week and was disappointed. Portions were very small for the prix fix $44.00. The select menu was mainly pasta. Salad of field greens was tasteless. I had the salmon which was very small and bland. Not sure how an Italian restaurant has only one veal dish. The atmosphere is nice with both inside and out dining."}
{"text":"YES YES AND YES. My husband and I ate here as a \"last hurrah\" dinner for our incredible vacation. We came on a Sunday evening and were able to get in for a 6:00 reservation outside. Like other Yelpers suggested, the specialty pastas and where it's at - don't even bother looking at the regular menu.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable. We asked her suggestion for a full-bodied red wine that wasn't too dry. She had one in mind she said wouldn't break the bank (turned out to be $17/glass - one of the lowest on the price scale) and to our surprise, she delivered perfectly and we both really enjoyed it.  My husband got the pasta with cheese and pepper made as part of the dough, which came with I believe the crisped proscuitto, while I went for the homemade sausage and truffle dish. We were truly BLOWN AWAY and how good our dishes were. We both ate the very last bites and still managed to share some tiramisu. This place is amazing and while probably as expensive as a dinner we'd go ($150 before tip), there were some other places we considered with multiple courses and costs twice the price (though still $$$ on Yelp). We would happily do this over again and would recommend to anyone looking for a low-key, romantic evening with incredible eats."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Like stepping into Italy. The food is like nothing I have had before, fresh, truly beautiful presentation and a treat for your taste buds!  Not only amazing cuisine but the restaurant family that is there makes it as though you are a guest in their home. You will be hooked and a frequent guest!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, impeccable service, and the ambiance is terrific. We have visited twice now and each time have walked away shaking our heads- the first time it was because- \"Why haven't we tried this place before?\" And the second time- \"We didn't think they could top that first visit but they sure did!!\" Both times we've visited, we ordered from their handmade pasta specials. Totally worth it!! We also had the buffalo mozzarella appetizer- so fresh and delicious. To cap off our wonderful evenings there, we've indulged in the chocolate espresso dessert- absolutely decadent; and the tiramisu- very yummy. Chef Marcellino, Sima and their staff are the best."}
{"text":"Incredible food and ambiance! The staff definitely needs some polishing to match everything else in this restaurant, but otherwise this is an outstanding place. If you want a romantic setting with authentic Italian food, lovely wines and incredible desserts, look no further."}
{"text":"Was recommended this restaurant as it has been around for some years and decided to have dinner with friends there. The environment is lovely. Clearly a classy place and has nice decor. There was a band playing (which was too loud) and we found it difficult to have conversation at a normal volume. We did have to speak quite loudly throughout dinner to hear each other.  The food was good although my wife did not enjoy her meal at all. Was a little cold and tasteless. I had the osso bucco which was very good. The others had the same and the lamb ragout, which they bother loved also. Wine list is pure Italy which is nice and the desserts were good, but over priced for the size of the servings. Overall, a reasonable dining experience."}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about Marcellino's so I went to lunch there today with my friend. Her salad was red leaf lettuce(NOTHING else)...the salad dressing was good. Her pasta(with sausage) was about as good as a can of Chef Boyardee. My grilled shrimp salad had 4 nicely grilled shrimp....and once again boring red leaf lettuce($18.95). The server was very nice.  Would I go back...no thank you...bitterly disappointed"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great here, clean bathrooms, beautiful patio and decorated cozily. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and courses along with the wine selection. The food was good but for the price I don't think it was worth it. This is a good spot for a first date if you want to impress her you have some money. I unfortunately didn't try the pasta but it is all handmade (I misunderstood the waiter and got what he recommended which was a light white fish, with mashed potatoes, zucchini and carrots) it was good but I wish I would have gotten some pasta just to try it. I also got the Insalata Tre Colori which was a Radicchio, endive and arugola with lemon dressing. The salad was okay, lacked a lot of flavor. It tasted slightly dirty but was decent (I probably wouldn't get that salad again). The wine selection is great. The one bus lady had a huge attitude and was rude (maybe she was having a bad day). I would try this place just one more time but go for the pasta this time."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the pasta special. Big portions and quality food.  The live music was a perfect volume and waiters were very attentive.  The only complaint that I have is the mediocre seating.   I would recommend this to anyone craving Italian food."}
{"text":"I am part Italian...so my husband and I have a VERY difficult time finding a restaurant that meets my expectations. So far this is the only one I will go back to. I was impressed that you could order a $48 pasta dish...but my husband and I ordered off the regular menu (not the specials). The chef does know his pasta and sauce! I ordered the Mare Y Monte (Land and Sea) pasta with shrimp. It had the quality ingredients, and no complaints on using FRESH tomato...this is what pasta sauce should be made with. My husband had clams and pasta....the pasta was Lovely!  Yes there was opera inside (beautiful), we chose to sit on the patio (a tad bit noisy because of street traffic).  The food and patrons may not be in my tax bracket....but I am willing to try it again (once I save up my change!)"}
{"text":"Popped in for an early evening happy hour - fantastic fresh food and a truly authentic Italian experience! The patio is simply beautiful, I didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"Been back to Marcellino's many times, every time excellent. My wife and I just celebrated our anniversary this past December first 2015 and had the extreme pleasure of having dinner at Marcellino's and to our surprise his very beautiful wife Sima was performing for the first time with her trio. All we can state is the food the service and the music what a wonderful  evening it was."}
{"text":"I only wish that Yelp allowed you to give you negative stars after eating at this dreadful restaurant. It is, by far, the worst Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Don't go here unless you like paying a ridiculous amount of money for a ridiculously small amount of bad food. And to top it off, the only thing that will match your tasteless food will be the horrible service you get.   The Food   Simply put, it's terrible. We're an Italian family that has eaten great Italian food from coast to coast and this is, by far, the worst we've ever had. All told, we had one appetizer and three different entrees and it was all tasteless. Virtually no flavor at all. Don't be fooled by something sounding good in the description on the menu if you are unfortunate enough to go here because it probably won't taste anything like it sounds. In fact, it may not have any taste at all. Our food was bland and not cooked properly. The chicken and steak were rubbery, the pasta undercooked and the shellfish chewy. The only good thing about the food is that the portions are so pathetically small that you won't have to suffer through eating it for too long and you will have plenty of room left in your stomach to go eat at a real restaurant after you leave here if you haven't maxed your credit card paying the bill. BTW, if you want to pay $15 for a piece of chocolate espresso cake about the size of a small cupcake this is the place for you.    The Service   Even worse than the food, if that is possible. We had to basically demand some bread because we were extremely hungry and we were told that they usually don't bring bread until after you order. We had to tell them to bring the bread three times and when they did there was no butter. That took another five minutes and it was hard as a rock when it showed up. Don't get too excited though....the bread is a half step up from Wonder Bread straight out of the supermarket. OK, that's not fair...Wonder Bread has more flavor. They pressure you to order, try to get the plates off the table as soon as you put your fork down and clearly want to get you in and out of there as fast as possible so the next poor sap can get your table and get robbed without a gun for a little portion of terrible food.   But Wait, There's More...CHECK YOUR CHECK!  As if overpaying for tiny portions of the crappiest, most tasteless Italian food you've ever eaten with horrendous service isn't enough, here comes the icing on the cake. They have the unmitigated gall to AUTOMATICALLY ADD A 20% GRATUITY TO YOUR BILL! And we were only 4 people, not a large party where this is sometimes done. It is straight up offensive but it might explain why the service is so bad because they know they are slamming you with a 20% gratuity so they probably couldn't care less. If you complain to them about it they will remove the forced gratuity which is somewhat like a pickpocket giving you back your wallet when you catch them counting your money.   Let me make this easy. DO NOT EAT AT THIS AWFUL EXCUSE FOR A RESTAURANT. But, if you have a bitter enemy that you absolutely despise and need to get some kind of revenge on, tell them to eat at this horrific establishment and sleep soundly knowing that you have gotten the last laugh."}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale AZ i was with a group of 8 and this restaurant was recommended by one of the people I was with who told us that he had dined here once before and that it was excellent.  The restaurant had a great low light vibe to it and the inside was clean and neat.  We were seated and served promptly.  So I look at the menu and could not help but to form my first impression that this was going to be one of \"those restaurants\" that has this fancy, cursive, old school-script written menus with a bunch of words on the menu that I did not know how to pronounce.  This silly, cursive, fancy print is pretty annoying and this type of restaurant usually results in the food winding up being average at best.  This is my actual experience anytime I have seen a menu like this.  Anyways this was not the case.  I actually struggled a bit to find an entree on the menu that I really desired.  nothing really stood out quite frankly on the regular menu.  Our server came around and then took our appetizer order.  We went light and ordered the mozzarella and tomato app and fried polenta.  Both were excellent, but both dishes are also kind of tough to screw up especially for a finer dining restaurant, right?  When the server came back after we devoured our apps, she reeled off 6 homemade pasta specials that were not on the menu.  Two of which caught my ear immediately.  So apparently this restaurant makes a bunch of different kinds of handmade, and flavor infused pastas each day along with a certain sauce to go along with it.  I recall one of the dishes being a butternut ravioli, and another being a sheet type of pasta with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce and chicken.  (A friend of mine sitting near me got this dish and it was awesome).  I went for the papardelle with a red lamb ragu.  It was epic to say the least.    Everybody at my table told me that they truly enjoyed their meals and unfortunately so much that we were too full to try any dessert.  Being from the east coast I did not expect much at all from an Italian restaurant in Arizona, I seriously didn't.  I did not mention the service but it was also very good.  Everything was flawless.  This place would be an absolute hit not only on the east coast but anywhere you put it in the US.  I will definitely be back here the next time I visit Scottsdale AZ. Great job."}
{"text":"Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch and ordered the lunch special (you can replace the wine with an additional appetizer).  The highlight of the meal was definitely the mussels in white wine appetizer.  The mussels were extremely fresh and tender, and the broth they were cooked it was so delicious that my entire family kept dipping the bread into my bowl.  The pastas are handmade and good.  Many of them have interesting additions (sun dried tomatoes, sweet potatoes), etc."}
{"text":"Although a bit on the pricey side, the creativity of this chef comes out in the food and drinks. I had some lamb dish that was delectable, tender and in just the right amount. My date has the filet Mignon pasta dish and it too was very good. The service was spot on as well.  Very classy. There was live music in the Sinatra style playing through the evening.   I had a mule drink that was very good.  My dates drink was great as well.   I didn't much care for where they sat us - next to the band - and that was the only turn-off particularly since they made it seem like we needed reservations, which clearly we didn't as the place was half empty on a Saturday night - off season of course.   But I forgave them and I had a wonderful date experience, thanks in part to them."}
{"text":"Went there for restaurant week with my girl friends.  We all pretty disappointed.  Foods were not tasty for that price.  Server had no personality and not smile once.  He rushed my friend to order when obviously he was told they were still waiting for me to get there.   Busser was nice and offered to take a picture for us.  Wish I could have tipped him instead.   Overall this place is overrated."}
{"text":"We were entertaining out of town guests. I made an Opentable 7:45 Thursday night reservations for a party of 4. When we arrived, we were greeted and seated right away. The atmosphere was very nice, with live music, we were seated more towards the entrance of the restaurant so the music did not drown our our conversation. Our server introduced himself and it was smooth sailing for the rest of the evening.  Our guest ordered a bottle of wine to share and my friend and I ordered cocktail while reviewing the menu. We started off with Beef Carpaccio. Pear Salad and Shrimp with Feta appetizers. Entrees were the Mussels in Spiced Tomato Sauce, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli, Veal Scaloppine with Gorgonzola and Gnocchi. We ended the night with Cappuccinos.  All the food was delicious and our server excellent as he was so patient in letting us catch up with conversation while still be attentive, so patient that we managed to be the last table of customers in the restaurant and were not asked to leave because of closing.  Atmosphere: very nice, Service: excellent, Food: very good, and thank you for letting close the restaurant... most enjoyable night."}
{"text":"We went for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We had been several times before and the food was memorable. This evening it was nothing like our previous experience. The dishes were all lacking flavor. I ordered the ravioli which I was so looking forward to and I was extremely disappointed. It was lacking flavor and was no where near the tasty dish I remembered from before. We also ordered the clam and muddle appetizer which tasted like rubber doused in water. We left spending $150 and wishing we went to Hillstone or another restaurant for our special evening out."}
{"text":"They say Phoenix's greatest restaurants are found in strip malls and this is a prime example.  A good friend took me here on a Monday night and we were greeted by the Italian husband and wife owners and shown all the fresh hand-made pasta specials of the evening.  I chose the crimini infused pasta with crimini mushrooms, truffle oil and....magic!  Caprese salad is the precursor to any italian meal and they have it perfected- adding roasted peppers.  The suggested wine was incredible and the pasta left me speechless!  It tasted just like the night in Rome when my new friend Fiorella took me on her vespa to the \"restaurant where typical italians eat\".  I savored each bite at Marcellino just as I did in Rome!  It is a bit pricey, but worth every cent!  I can't wait to go back!  P.S. I tried to incorporate the genius term \"American Bastardization\" into my yelp like Anne W, but couldn't get it to fit.  The analogy Marcellino:Rome as Olive Garden:American Bastardization of Rome is my best attempt."}
{"text":"We sat at the Chef's table. He was very pleasant. Wines served ranged from $ 9 to  $ 30 at best [ as per Vivino] with ratings less of 2 to 3 stars. Plates served were mediocre. We ( couple) paid around $500.00 with tip. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service (our waiter was most entertaining), impressive wine selection, phenomenal food. Deciding to take advantage of the cooler weather, we enjoyed our meal on the quaint patio. I had the seafood special with squid ink pasta, mussels, clams, calamari and a 3/4 lb. lobster in a spicy marinara sauce. It was easily one of the most enjoyable Italian dishes I've tried yet (and I consider myself to be quite the Italian cuisine connoisseur). I will definitely be back to enjoy this neighborhood gem situated on the Waterfront in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. Our 2nd time here. Celebrated my  daughters 21st Birthday.  Excellent homemade pasta."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing. The jumbo shrimp with feta cheese appetizer was delicious and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. The chefs special portofino was with shrimp and scallops. The dish did not taste \"fishy\" and the sauce was a little spicy. My girlfriend got the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce and it was phenomenal. The best part of the whole meal was the tiramisu at the end. The home made whipped cream even came out on fire! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best. Italian. Cuisine.!!! Day fresh pasta, rustic yet refined. The husband wife team is the charm of this fantastic restaurant and the kicker is the amazing food. I have eaten here maybe 50 times maybe more and it is ALWAYS perfection! Top notch staff, clean and beautiful decor obviously these folks are pros long live Marcelino's!"}
{"text":"Overrated period! Wow. Looks like we set a low bar for itialian food in az. Group of 8 and most of the dishes were just ok. Everyone had a different meal. The raw lamb chops didnt sit well either. Zuppa de pesca was sub par. Portions of seafood in dishes sub par. Server also was not pleasant either.    The plus side is great atmosphere great location great music. Food i can find better on anycorner.  is this place still in business must be all the resorts recommending a place they never stepped   foot in for a kickback."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews on Yelp of Marcellino's, and so was eager to try it, so I scheduled a lunch meeting there today.  Given the glowing reviews, I will probably give it one more chance at dinner sometime, but it was definitely a let down.  I had a six top, and we were six of the 8 people in the entire place for lunch.    Service was good, with frequent refills, and they left us plenty of time to get to business before taking our orders.  There was an alright red pepper spread for the bread, although olive oil and balsamic would have been a welcome addition.  Most of the table got either grilled chicken or salmon, which came with a small green salad: portions were very small for mid teens to lower 20s per entree for lunch.  I and another person got the shrimp and scallops in a lightly spiced red sauce with linguine dish.  There were plenty of shrimp, but they were small and extremely overcooked: they reminded me of shrimp that have been left in a ceviche for too long.  The scallops were cut into very small pieces, and were also overcooked, although not as badly as the shrimp were.  The sauce was made with fresh tomatoes, which were left in large chunks, and I have to say I would have very much preferred the use of canned San Marzano tomatoes instead: it was mild, with little body to it.  The pasta was not badly done, but seemed a bit soft for my taste in pasta.  Overall, very disappointing, but so many good experiences can't be wrong, can they?"}
{"text":"Went with my wife for just dessert. Had one of the best tiramisu. Live music was great. Bit pricey."}
{"text":"Came here as a surprise to my bf on his birthday. They exceeded every request I made and gave us the most romantic table on the patio. The chef's wife came by to wish him a happy birthday. We even received multiple complementary courses (an appetizer, dessert, and drink). Service was outstanding-definitely no rush from staff. We opted for two of their off-menu homemade pasta dishes. We ate: scallop pesto appetizer (scallops were a bit small for price but sauce was yummy to dip their bread in). We also ordered the homemade filet, vegetable, cheese tortellini (my favorite) and a spicy sundried tomato pasta with shrimp and scallop). They are expensive but well worth it. Our waiter even offered to split the plates and course them out since we wanted to share- a very classy offering that allowed us to each get to try both pastas w/o having to share a plate and take our time through the meal since they were coursed out for us. It was one of our best and favorite dining experience-will be back!"}
{"text":"A go to every time I'm in Scottsdale. Go for the homemade pastas that are made fresh daily with different options each time I visit. This isn't the place to order the salmon, while I'm sure its delicious. I absolutely love the lamb ragu with pappardelle and would every single visit. I recently ventured away from the ragu (thanks a lot Lent) and had the tagliolini with shrimp. It was fantastic. All portions are good size and I'd expect to have some left over.   Great spot to sit outside in March with some great wine (awesome wine list) and pasta. if you want a great night of Italian in Scottsdale this is your place."}
{"text":"Nice time overall.  Food was very good, and waiter was informative and nice.  We had an early reservation and asked to sit outside (in the front) but was told those tables were reserved -- and then the two I had my eye on remained empty our entire meal.  Oh well.  We enjoyed the restaurant, and would likely return."}
{"text":"I cannot thank Bettina, Vita, Sima, Chef Marcellino and the entire staff enough for the memorable meal we had Saturday night. We wanted to celebrate my mother's birthday and last minute, like typical Italians, they accommodated our party of seven and got us in, rolled out the red carpet and arranged for us to enjoy the private room! If you want great wine, great service, beautiful ambiance all while enjoying the most TO DIE FOR hand crafted pasta---don't walk but run to Marcellino's! Just be sure to make a reservation, because you will never be as lucky as we were especially if it is high season. Everything on the menu is worth it-worth the money, worth the carbs and worth the calories. You only live once, ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. There is great attention to detail in everything from the ambiance to the service. Try the handmade pasta specials and you will not be disappointed! We enjoyed the mushroom sun-dried tomato pasta with jumbo shrimp which was quite flavorful but also intrinsically simple and complementary with Marcellino's bold red sauce. Both the tiramisu and creme brûlée should not be missed. Love the outdoor patio in the heart of old town.   We did have an off night once and the ownership really went above and beyond to make it right as they've truly built an \"Italiano vero\" experience.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Italian spots  I have had in years. The pasta is freshly made to order and was absolutely delicious. The ambiance is perfect for romance or a date with your child (my 9 year old that it was great) The only thing that I didn't care for was the shrimp or the clams but I'm pickier then most. I had the pasta with clams and my daughter the light pasta with shrimp cooked spicy by request. The sauce, the pasta, the service and the ambiance 5 stars all the way. Family owned and the wife was super friendly and seems to enjoy and take pride in their biz.  All in all highly recommend and will definitely come back when I'm in AZ again"}
{"text":"It took me a very long time to find an Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area that I really enjoyed.  I had all the usual suspects in Scottsdale and Phoenix recommended to me, to varying degrees of success.  Most of them were good, but nothing that I would rather go to, than just make my own food at home.  A friend finally brought me to Marcellino's about 5 years ago, back when they were in North Phoenix (I miss that little place).    Since the first day I went, Marcellino has been serving some of the best handmade pasta that I have ever had.  But my absolute favorite are his lamb chops and filet.  With so many favorites to choose from, it's easier most days to just order the chef's tasting menu, which usually includes a duo of my some of my favorite appetizers (scallops, or mushroom polenta, or some buffalo mozzarella and tomato, etc.), a duo of pastas and a carne or a duo.    Not only is the food amazing, there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family, Scottie.  His knowledge of the menu, food, wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming.  His service takes this place a notch above the rest."}
{"text":"It is with pleasure that I bestow upon Marcellino Ristorante my coveted 5 star review                                                                                                                                                          *  *  * FANFARE *  *  *                    Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.  We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.  After that we shared 2 entrees:  The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.  Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.    We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.  Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti \"I Sodi\", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana \"Colle Del Re\" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.  Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Props to Marcellino for making all their pasta in-house.  This is really one of the best places to get Italian in the Valley.  The lack of a 5-star review goes to value and comparison to other Italian joints.  It can get pricey here and for a lot of people, the perceived value of this place could be low.  There are other places nationwide that serve handmade pasta for a lower price point for equal to better quality.  I will say, though, that when ti comes to flavored pastas, you can actually taste what the noodle is supposed to be flavored with here, as opposed to some other Italian joints.  On our last visit, coming back to the value issue, we ordered the scallops.  They were delicious.  Perfectly cooked.  The pesto was good.  But these were 3 quite small diver scallops.  Smallest I've seen on a restaurant plate.  Again, nothing wrong with the taste, just a value issue.  We all ordered pasta dishes and every dish came out fine.  A solid al dente, maybe a little on the soft side of al dente, but still had some chew.  Never over-sauced and good balance of flavor.  Their noodles tend to be a little thicker than other places, which is fine, just different.    But compared to Rome, and some places in CA and NYC, can't give these guys 5 stars.  They are pretty good.  The value can be a little questionable, but decent handmade pasta is tough to find in the Valley."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Italian Food,  this is the place !!! Marcellino Ristorante is a great place to enjoy true and delicious Italian home made pasta, meats and appetizers. And if you are like me and really love a phenomenal tiramisu, I promise you will find it here. Gorgeous atmosphere, great location and fabulous live entertainment  featuring Sima and her all star trio! If you're  lucky, you will also enjoy the impeccable service by server Paola - straight from Northern Italy! Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"What an I say everything was PERFECT! Our waiter Marcos was such a sweetheart and very attentive. Our pastas were amazing and the cheesecake was so yummy and authentic. The ambiance was beautiful. AMAZING restaurant! Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Food is not cooked all the way,they did not wear gloves.Food not cooked all the way. Good real famous filmmakers went & had seen worker in restroom not wash their hands,so they got up & left.  When I write a review it is the truth. Restaurant needs to correct problem.DONOTREMOVE This."}
{"text":"Pros: cute  Nice wAit staff   Cons: price 35+ per plate Taste: bland and under done meat cooked wrong Lighting: very dark  Cold plates and food. When two plates were taken back for taste they showed up anyway on our bill When we had an issue with our food the manager only came to the table once, the chef never came out, the food was solid OK if we were at applebees this would still only be three stars  Save e $$"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my parents out to a nice Italian dinner. It's always risky and quite difficult pleasing my dad who is an immigrant from Rome, Italy. But we thought we'd get lucky coming here.   For starters the service was extremely slow and it was a Tuesday night which wasn't busy at all.   The food was extremely pricey for what they offered.     We ordered 4 plates, 2 different pasta plates, lamb and a chicken dish. They were just good, but definitely NOT worth the steep prices, I expected so much more!!   The highlight was a delicious garlicky, red pepper bread spread and the tiramisu for dessert.   Overall wasn't crazy about our dinner experience. Probably won't be returning, considering there's plenty of other Italian options."}
{"text":"We have just finished a dinner at the Citizen Public House and were still not just feeling like going home yet. Maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home. It was after 9pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellino's on our way back to garage and I said: \"What about trying this before we go?!\" Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another 45 mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were 3 or more 2-place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us: WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant -  which made us happy."}
{"text":"This place is not very good.  I went for lunch on a Saturday and it was slow.  This restaurant is between Barrio Queen and The Herb Box.  Both of those restaurants are packed on Saturday for lunch.  This place was slow; there was only my table and three others.  This should have been my first clue.  The woman who sat us had tattoos down one arm and a bad attitude.  This should have been my second clue.  The service was slow even though the restaurant was dead.  The food was awful.  We started with the mussel appetizers and the mussels were old.  We complained about it and they said that the mussels were just delivered.  I have spoken with the owners of other restaurants and they have told me that the meat distributors would sell old meat and fish to restaurant owners that didn't know what they were doing.  These people are obviously clueless.  I ordered a shrimp salad and I was told that it would come with four jumbo shrimp, the salad had three shrimp that weren't jumbo.  The cocktails were weak.  This is another place that is doomed to go out of business and it is because the owners are incompetent"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite for fine Italian cuisine. Chef is amazing. Friendly and attentive to his guests. Dim, beautiful ambiance. Everything is just right. Amazing wines handmade pastas and memorable service. I always have a great experience. Love talking with chef. Great date spot. Nice location. Pricy but well worth it. Get the porcini infused handmade pasta with lobster and truffle cream sauce. Life...changed. Go here, leave happy. This is real authentic fine Italian, don't expect that american imitation when you come here."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever eaten! Any time I travel to Scottsdale I must dine here. And I plan company dinner events here too. Chef and Sima and Bettina are so accommodating and engaging. Every meal I've had has felt like it was made especially for me. I recommend Marcellino to anyone and everyone I know will be anywhere near. Scottsdale. Deliizioso!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic!!! Had one of the fresh ly made pasta dishes even though I had planned on getting a chicken dish on the menu.  It was great with crispy pancetta in a white sauce. My husband ordered a fresh pasta with a sun dried tomato sauce and shrimp...also excellent.  The tiramisu was very good, but similar to others I've had except for the flaming sugar which was fun.  Only issue is, as always, parking in that area. We were lucky enough to get the last spot in the valet lot across the street, but the trip is well worth it. We will dine there again."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The place is very small and cozy, and decorated very warmly inside. They have a private nook in the back corner of the restaurant, as well as a full bar. Live music is featured most nights. All of the pasta is homemade fresh daily, and is very very good. One time they had Venison on the specials menu and it was so unbelievable I swear I can still taste it. Sima and Marcellino, the owners are great people, even if Marcellino is almost impossible to understand. The place is definitely not inexpensive, but in my opinion worth eveyry penny to actually get some high end Italian that is otherwise very hard to find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant anywhere!  The ambiance in this place is one of a kind.  Memories are made here.  They have live music on Thursday and Saturday nights.  We were in town for a business event. We travel here at least twice a year and always make a trip here.  You do need reservations during prime times or if you have a larger party.  We all ordered cocktails which were pretty to look at, and amazing to drink! They bring out bread with a yummy tomato butter that I could eat right out of the bowl.  They will bring out their fresh hand made pastas of the day and leave at your table to discuss. The handmade pastas are more expensive then the menu, but  they are so worth it. We all had something different to allow us to try multiple things.  They have both cream based and tomato based sauce options. There are mushroom, panchetta, prawns, lobster, baked into this pasta.  Yes, in the actual pasta!  They have a tortellini that has filet minion stuffed in it!  You read that right!!  We did not opt for the desserts this time, but they are all super yummy!  Service is incredible and environment is outstadnding.  If the weather allows, eat outside!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's. I couldn't have taken a better choice. The place was AWESOME!! Very cozy atmosphere, very elegant, very good food, easy access, great service, they even had a live opera singer on stage, it was a very pleasant experience! True, it was more expensive than what I had anticipated, but worthy for that very special date."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best place for not only food, but atmosphere and music.  The food is divine.  The restaurant is first class and the owners are like your best new friend.  I love this place! Will always bring my family, friends and even by myself.  I am always treated great.  Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Would have gotten 4 except for server and prices, gratuity automatically included.  Expresso was excellent, I highly recommend.  Food was tasty"}
{"text":"Delicious! The pasta is AMAZING although very expensive for... pasta. The service is always wonderful, the staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. I love sitting outside! Perfect for a romantic date night! I will definitely return and will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband's favorite upscale Italian! (He is a noodle guy!) We have eaten there about every 4-6 weeks since we learned of it last summer! Pastas are handmade daily and are authentically Italian! I loved the set summer menu + have also loved their steak & fish! The flaming desserts are fun, along with live music nights! I loved the coffee and biscotti at the end of my meal!"}
{"text":"great food, nice service... far location but worth it... just be carefull with the specials prices... raviloi for $32 for lunch...a lillte to much... sure I'll come back.... DELICIOSO... BRAVO..."}
{"text":"As exquisite a fine dining experience as can be, all of that without the usual pretense that fine dining can bring. In this day and age and let's not forget, lean economic times; it is refreshing to find white tablecloth, knowledgeable wait staff, welcoming hosts etc...  Chef Marcellino and charming wife Sima did a magnificent job updating the space previously leased by gastropub Digestif. The beautiful wood stayed accented by cozy and sooth lighting.  Marcellino throws a twist to fine dining Italian that other chefs have not dared venturing to risk. Everything is made from scratch ans sure taste like it. The portions perfectly sized to allow enjoyment of all the ingredients without getting bloated.  The owners are very warm and welcoming and are very true to their craft. The kitchen is impeccable."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation. My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system. The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"For Arizona Restaurant Week, we selected Marcellino to try last night with friends. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and very inviting. Marcellino offered multiple options for a three course dinner. Most of my party started with the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto served on top of a tomato with roasted red peppers on the side. It was a delicious twist on a caprese salad. For the main, most of us chose the Paccatela pasta. This was a short cut thick pasta noodle with a sausage ragu. It was exceptional. For dessert, our group enjoyed both the Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. Yummy. The entire staff was attentive and personable, and Chef Marcellino even dropped by our table to welcome us. What a great meal and evening. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"C'mon folks, I mean you all that gave Marcellinos five stars.  This is what I found on my second trip there in three years.  You simply can not make up for the substandard value on the Lobster special I had with some music and atmosphere.  Wait staff kept calling the Lobster one half of one and a half pounds.  Cut to the chase and call it three quarters of a pound, which turned out to be two oz's of meat and 10 oz's of shell.  Home made pasta was good, sauces good, main waiter, inattentive and confusing.  For $600, I expect to be treated like we are getting ready to spend $600, (six of us).  Here is what you do with party of six: split your party into two tables so you will not be dinged for the automatic 20% tip.  Wait staff must think, HO HUM, we are going to get our 20, work for it or not.  Salad was only fair, appetizers over priced.  I have been making Cannelloni at home since 1974 that blows all the minds that have eaten it. I don't think I have ever heard anyone talk about dining out like they have reacted to sitting at my table for Cannelloni and Cesar salad.  Cesar salad by the way matched by only two restaurants in 50 years of dinning out."}
{"text":"A truly authentic Italian experience is waiting for you at Marcellino Ristorante. From the moment you set foot on the patio it feels like you've arrived to the most intimate and lovely Italian garden. The experience continues with handmade pastas, five-star service, and live music from the owner herself! Our evening was guided by a very informative wait staff. The courses we ordered were perfectly paired with wine selections. I had the porcini pasta with lobster tail and my better half enjoyed the pappardelle with lamb ragu. These dishes reminded us of our time in Rome, and were truly delicious! I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a high quality dining experience. The atmosphere was relaxed yet sophisticated, and I can't wait to return! Cheers to Marcellino!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough amazing things about Marcellinos! My boyfriend and I eat here whenever we get the chance, and since yesterday was his birthday, of course it was his only request. We always have a drink at the bar and I have to stay that the holiday drink they have was unbelievable! Please keep it on the menu.  They sat us in the little romantic cove in the wall which was super cute and cozy. We were so lucky to end up having Eric take care of us last night. His knowledge of food and wine pairing was outstanding I don't have enough good words to say and he was so friendly and passionate. We chose the beef carpaccio dish with a glass of white wine to start. Then he suggested the osso bucco for my boyfriend and I chose the tortellini but sauced with a black truffle savory sauce rather than the traditional red. And lemme tell you, these 4 giant tortellini are filled with slow roasted beef and veggies pureed together for the most amazing comforting dish. And the wine of course paired perfectly. For dessert, Eric suggested we keep it simple and clean and served us a light orange sorbet with whipped creme and caramel drizzle. Yum! The experience every time we choose Marcellinos just keeps getting better and better."}
{"text":"Read all the great reviews so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately the only thing that was high were the prices. $38 for some pasta shells stuffed with something and mediocre tomato sauce. $38 for very average fish special. Nice atmoshere and good music but food was average at best"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for my father who was just getting out of the hospital. They couldn't have been more efficient or accommodating. The food even though take out was authentic and amazing.  Portions are good- it's pricey but worth the money for a great meal and experience.   Pasta- homemade and cooked to perfection.  The veal w/Gorgonzola that my dad had put a huge smile on his face.  Pear salad not great but it was take out so I can't really judge.  Going back to dine there this weekend."}
{"text":"Was hoping to be blown away by homemade pasta but unfortunately we were not. IMO the gnocchi was good but the porcini infused pasta was very bland. Had to ask for and add salt, which should have been added during cooking process.  Maybe will be back but would have to be really craving italian food and if thats the case might try to look for another restaraunt."}
{"text":"The regular menu is average quality.  However, the special, infused pastas are spectacular (with prices to match).  Small portions but super filling.  A popular spot with locals."}
{"text":"You will definitely find fresh homemade pasta here. This restaurant is beautiful with a very intimate setting. I had their pasta special and it was outstanding. I paired my meal with their Italian red wine. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta and high quality ingredients make all the difference. This place has the best bucatini amatriciana, heck maybe anywhere. It isn't just good for AZ. It's actually good. Seriously this compares to east coast Italian. Everything was cooked perfectly. The party I was with consumed a great deal of wine, and seemed to approve of the list. Deserts (cheesecake, tiramisu) were also pretty great. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  We were greeted with warm smiles from everyone.   We did not have a reservation but space was fo bd for us.  The food. Oh. My. God.  So good!  I had ribbon pasta with a lamb ragu.  Simply amazing. Our service was over the top perfect.  I can wait to come back again."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Marcellino's\"s. The homemade pasta is the best. We took company personal with us and they raved about it as we do. Service is wonderful. Wine list is limited but good."}
{"text":"ahhh Marcellino...  Why do you have to get me drunk? Funny thing is, the more we drink the more I understand your english. Thanks for the help.  There are few places in the valley that can be called true Italian, not to mention ones that are ran by a real Italian chef. Sometimes we go there and ask Marcellino to just \"go for it\" - havent been dissapointed yet.  BOTTOM LINE: Worth every penny! Dont change a thing."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  The food, service, ambiance, and everything else were amazing.  We especially enjoyed some of the hand made pastas, but it was all very good."}
{"text":"I asked for alfredo sauce here and the watier looked at me like I was the Rain Man.  The atmosphere is cool here, but the food is overpriced and it feels stuffy in here because the staff is so serious and of course stuck up since it's Snotsdale."}
{"text":"We love this place! We've been a few times and have always had a great time and a fantastic meal. The last time we were there, we had a strange experience with one of the waiters, he seemed completely put out, like he wanted to be somewhere else. We spoke to Sima and she assigned someone else to our table ~ everything was great!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff is incredible and so knowledgeable -- not to mention they are actually from Italy. It's definitely a special-occasion place though -- not for the everyday unless you're made of cashola. Great atmosphere, great food. Also you can sign up for their e-mails which tell you about upcoming wine tastings, special menus, etc. Four thumbs up (two from me, two from hubby)."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Top notch quality food and service. Jared was our waiter and he was very attentive and knowledgeable of all the entrees and wine selections. We had a spectacular time hence the 5 stars. We are definitely coming back here when we're back in town. We tried 4 of the special handcrafted pasta dishes, we were all blown away by each entree. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable, the food was mediocre.  I feel the pasta could have been so much more, it just didn't live up to what I expected for the price.  Also, the plating was sloppy and uninviting.  When they charge this much for the food, and the service is as good as it is, I expect a bit more in the presentation and the development of character in the sauces.  Perhaps we just need to get something other than the pasta if we ever return."}
{"text":"Food was a little pricey but absolutely terrific. Only down side , on the Saturday I went , was the \"entertainment\" a horribly offkey \"crooner\""}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  We go here for our birthdays, anniversaries, etc... any special occasion is a reason to go to Marcellino (or just no occasion other than date night)!  What do we love?  The fresh pasta presentation at the beginning of the meal is so fun.  The food is always exceptionally tasty.  The ambiance is lovely.  The owner and his wife walk around the restaurant to ensure that everyone is enjoying their meal - and everyone always looks very happy.  The have live music on most nights as well which makes the entire space feel very intimate.  They also have this great private booth you can reserve for special occasions.    I can't say enough good things about Marcellino.  It's our \"GO TO\" place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We we're Recommended Marcellino's from our concierge at the Four Seasons. It was  a delicious home made tasting, Italian cuisine meal. The atmosphere relaxing with Italian music playing. Our waiter Marco was friendly, knowledgeable and had great recommendations. We try a different Italian restaurant every year we visit Scottsdale, but our group will definitely return to Marcellino. Best Italian found."}
{"text":"I first went to Marcellino Ristorante, on a recommendation from strangers, by playing hookie when I was a sophomore in college, not long after they'd opened.   It was an expensive lunch, since I had three courses and ordered one of their specials, but it was very good, and Sima, who runs the front of the place, was delightful.   I came back a couple times and was just blown away by how good everything was. My early enthusiasm was borne out with its various New Times awards, and it has been my pleasure since then to turn many satisfied people on to what is without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in Arizona, and in my opinion one of the best overall.   The place's new location does it justice, although those of us prone to nostalgia miss the old one. I spent most of the last three years overseas, and when I was back visiting home, Marcellinos was always my top priority, and never disappointed me.   Everything that they make is excellent, though I'm particularly attached and addicted to their thick, short, toothsome Pacatelli pasta with ragu di salsiccia , which is generously available at a discount for lunch.    I don't know whether or not anyone can say that it is \"perfect\" pasta, but I would wager a lot that there is no pasta that is better. It is flawless. As close to the platonic ideal as we can get.   The same could probably be said of their tiramisu.   Unfortunately it's not possible anymore to spend an afternoon drinking wine and espresso and smoking cigars on their patio, but that was only ever just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here a couple of months ago while visiting Scottsdale. We discovered this place through Yelp and we were not disappointed at all!  We came here on a Saturday evening, with out a reservation. The dining area was packed so we sat at the bar.... which is where we love to sit at anyway.  The bartender and waitstaff were more than accommodating and the service was impeccable.  Our bartender, Troy, was informative and very helpful..... and his recommendations were on point.   We especially love that the menu focuses on their infused fresh pasta.  All of the dishes were delicious! We had ravioli, linguini with clams, tuna carpaccio and shrimp scampi.... all of which were tasty and scrumptious.   After dessert, Troy joined us with a shot of their house made Limoncello. We will definitely return to Marcellino's during our next Scottsdale visit. Vino cheers dear diners!!"}
{"text":"They say first impressions are sometimes wrong. I say you can figure out how the establishment is even with a simple order 'to go'.   I called the restaurant on a Thursday night around 6 and spoke with Logan who put me on hold for 10 minutes. After that, I simply hung up and called again. A different person answered the phone and courteously took my order of spaghetti clams with white sauce. I remembered repeating the word SPAGHETTI since I didn't want anything else with the clams. I knew they had their dish called \"Scialatielli\" clams however I figured no Italian restaurant in town would be out of spaghetti. I also asked what the soup of the day was and the waitress didn't even know. Bad. At 6 o'clock your shift should have begun already. Not knowing what their soup du jour is already makes me not want to order it. Indeed I stuck with the spaghetti only.   After all this journey, I get to the restaurant and my order was ready. Good. But it was not what I ordered. The lady I spoke with did indeed put the Scialatielli with clams, which is more of a fat over cooked chewy version of the linguine with a little bit of red sauce. Too bad I didn't check on the moment. I would have sent it back and not paid for it.   What it pissed me more is that they really TRIED TO FOOL ME!! SCIALATIELLI IS NOT SPAGHETTI! The waitress came to me and with an attitude of an arrogant said that Scialatielli is the Italian word for spaghetti. NO. YOU BACK UP AND YOU SHUT UP!! I'm from Italy my dear, authentically FROM Italy. I was born and raised in Milan, been here for 3 years, my last name is Petrucci and I absolutely do not accept this prank.  Scialatielli might be a Southern Italian dialect for spaghetti. But it's not even close to it. In Italiano si dice spaghetti. Gli Scialatielli li conoscete solo voi!!!   If you didn't have spaghetti, I would have MUCH APPRECIATED YOUR HONESTY, instead of making me pay $25 (plus tip cause I personally always tip) for a lousy pasta dish.   I've heard the owner is from Benevento, perhaps she should go back there to make those Scialatielli. I would have hold my opinion if the food was good. But after the outrageous customer service, I cannot be silent.   No one likes to be made a fool of. I will do my best to DEFAME your business."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's more than just the food at the restaurant! You can't really ignore the setting, decor and ambiance of this place. It's literally nestled in Old Town near the galleries and sunken below the street level. It's surrounded by wine art-like bottles coming out of concrete walls and fountains, wrought iron, and shrubs and greenery. I mean, you could get engaged here it's so beautiful and romantic! ME, however; I'm there for the food! And it's tadiefawr!! We had the special appetizer which was a Buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and olive oil drizzle. Salads were fresh and crisp. I went with the veal scalopine and it was incredible. They offered options and variations of some dishes which gave you the ability to mix and create a  little. I would love to try sometime for lunch. There was music on the patio outside but we were in the restaurant area. Now that it has cooled down, I would go back and sit outside. I bet it's amazing! The waiters and wait staff are sophisticated and educated on their dishes so talk them up and get their feedback. This is probably now one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale for sure for the whole experience. Unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Arizona!  Excellent ambience, fantastic and friendly staff. Good for a romantic or dinner with friends.  Marcellino likes to walk through the dining room and great the guests once or twice during the evening adding a nice touch to the experience."}
{"text":"Went for New Year's Eve and it was nice to not have a prix fixe menu at a place with live music. We were sitting inside then went outside due to how loud the music was and a singer that wasn't the very best. Sitting outside was much better with the heaters on; it was very comfortable. I ordered the Scaloppine Gorgonzola which was very good, thinly sliced veal in a wonderful sauce that came with carrots (that were a little too crunchy), zucchini and broccolini. My husband had the caprese salad which he liked but the roasted peppers were so bitter that he couldn't eat those and after trying myself agreed. I was surprised that they wanted to charge us for the bread but the waiter took it off the bill since they only had a baguette on NYE and he raved on how good the focaccia bread was but then realized they weren't serving it. For dessert we ordered tiramisu which was good with a nice presentation of a flaming sugar cube. Service was good, attentive but not overbearing. What was strange is after our entree the waiter asked if he could bring back our compliments to the chef. We were dumbfounded and taken by surprise no restaurant had ever asked us that before."}
{"text":"The two stars I'm giving are primary for the mediocre food and the chef. The service was great- so 5 stars for that.  I only eat pasta that is made fresh and in house, and I can 100% say this place is overpriced basic bitch pasta. The texture of the squid ink pasta was largely unimpressive, it could have been grocery store linguine. I ordered the squid ink pasta not for the novelty (I've had it before) but for the seafood preparation that went along with it, as they have a rigid pasta regimen. It had lobster and calamari with it.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, but unfortunately the chef refused to make a different sauce to go with pasta.   Typically, I would be ok with that, that is.. if the dish is going to blow my mind. But..if I'm being honest, the regular old red sauce tasted like Classico straight off the shelf of my local Safeway.  I'm not sure what the stink was with regard to not switching up the sauce...it might have saved the mundane texture of the pasta.   I'm not sure if maybe the other pastas actually taste like fresh, made in-house pasta? this tasted like maybe it was made a week or two prior..fresh pasta should be soft but al dente with just the right amount of silky chewiness. this pasta was a bit too dense and hard for me believe it is made daily in house. If it is, I am content to know that I can get the same dish by just hitting up bucca di Beppo for less money. And they'll probably make it with the sauce I want.   Won't be going back to this place! Hoping to find a better local joint for good, fresh made pasta."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.  Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles."}
{"text":"The food and service was good. The reason why I give 2 stars is because of their menu. First of all I don't understand all this 95 cents in the menu. $14.95, $18.95, $24.95... Is it a fine dining restaurant or Walmart? That's a turn off because it's kind of cheap. Any expensive restaurant you go to they all have menu with even numbers. Another turn off was when I saw that they charge $3 for ice. Seriously??? This is embarrassing. They also have only one bathroom which is very inconvenient and it was dirty. For $200 dinner there are much better restaurants out there. We won't come back."}
{"text":"An associate and myself took some of our best clients to dinner while attending the UnitedPlanners Conference in Scottsdale. What a great experience. Happen to have live music and the food was fantastic. Clients loved it as well."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience as my wife and I celebrated 30 years of marriage at this upscale Italian restaurant.  We opted for the Monday night three course chefs special with the wine paring.  There was a bit of mixup as the Internet price ($49 p/p) did not reflecrt the price increase after their move to the new location.  However after a short  discussion, the Internet price was honored.   After the complimentary bruchetta, our first wine was presented to us - a lovely chianti blend that introduced our first course.  The first course had two very different offerings.  A wonderful mushroom sauce was served over Polenta - this was my favorite.  The other offering in the first course was traditional Insalata Caprese - mozzarella, local tomatoes and basil.  Both of these dishes were perfect. The second course was preceded by a local Tuscany red wine that was a blend of 4 grapes.  This pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara  pasta dish.  All of their pastas are home made and were cooked to perfection.  The ravioli was my favorite!  The main course consisted of two fillets of a Mediterranean fish that was a member of the Monk fish family.  It was served with a yummy garlic sauce and accented by perfectly mashed white potatoes dressed with fresh Basil.   The evening was romantic and the service was just right.  We had a wonderful dining experience in this Anniversary stopover in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The reason I give one star is because I can't give zero. Had arranged a dinner last night for three couples and anticipated a nice evening. This was destroyed by Marcellino. My wife, sitting next to me, had ordered calves liver for her entree. She was served chicken by one of the wait staff. It was sent back, only to be returned to her by our waitress, who argued that was what she had ordered (my friend sitting next to me and I both knew differently). It was finally decided, with some difficulty, that the chicken would be replaced with the liver. Imagine our surprise when she was served veal. At that point, my wife was so angry that we cancelled her dinner. The waitress and the manager apologized and even offered to serve us desert (in which none of us had any interest) without charge. We declined.   We were treated poorly and with little other than a perfunctory apology and offer of free desert. My wife left hungry and angry. My meal was indifferent but I just left angry. My friends were truly surprised by the level of service and particularly by the seeming apathy towards the repeated mistakes. I suppose I should be grateful that we were not charged for her dinner.   Obviously, we will not be back.   After posting this review, I received a response from the owner and wife of the chef inviting my wife and me to be their guests at a dinner to demonstrate their passion and commitment to fine dining.  While I appreciate the invitation, I will point out that the six people at our table all shared in the disappointment and the poor attitude of those who served us.   If the other couples are invited as guests, we will accept the invitation. Otherwise we will decline. I don't believe my wife nor I would wish to face the scowl I received from the chef when I cancelled her order without reinforcement."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in town for a golf tournament and since we wanted Italian, I searched Yelp for \"Best Italian Scottsdale\"...Marcellino came up in the results and boy...am I glad they did!  Upon entering, I was immediately impressed by the décor and ambiance. This place is great for a first date or any other romantic/special occasion.    Our server was warm, friendly and very attentive (sorry, I don't remember his name but he is from New Orleans) - he made our dining experience very enjoyable.    My fiancé thoroughly enjoyed his veal dish and I opted for salmon (which was delicious by the way).  We also had a side of the home made sundried tomato pasta (DON'T PASS UP THE PASTA)!   This is hands down the best Italian food I've had since leaving the east coast.  If you are looking for authentic Italian food, don't pass them up!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Fall 2015  Terry T and I went here with non-Yelper Julie on Monday, Sept. 21 and had a truly outrageous meal. Everything we ordered was split between the three of us.  We started out splitting the mozzarella and prosciutto, polenta al funghi and scallops con pesto. I ate them in that order, because I knew--while all should be delicious--the scallops would be amazing. And they were, on all accounts. The mozzarella was fresh, served with roasted red peppers and fresh tomato; grilled polenta fries surrounded perfectly sautéed mushrooms; and the scallops were perfectly cooked and rested in the best pesto I've had in my life!  Next course: ravioli del giorno, gnocchi Sorrentina, and filettino al tartufo. Same eating pattern applied here. Three huge (like, the size of my hand) raviolis stuffed with spinach and ricotta [if I'm remembering right] and a brown butter sauce were easily split between our group. The brown butter sauce was a bit understated, but otherwise was a really good dish. The gnocchi--dang, I love gnocchi--were tender and cradled in a delicate tomato sauce. I'm generally not a huge red sauce fan but this was executed wonderfully. Finally, the medium-rare grilled filet was mouth-watering and the Barolo reduction was decadent.  Wrapping up our meal, we ordered two servings of tiramisu and one panna cotta. In hindsight, we'd probably order two panna cotta if we were able to do it again. Not that the tiramisu was divine; it's just we had a harder time sharing the panna cotta. Both were fantastic, I assure you.  We also checked out there non-Restaurant Week offerings and will be heading back for those."}
{"text":"Food sounded great on the menu. Presentation was good. The staff was great. I got the pork with brown sauce, it had almost no flavor. The potatoes were very bland and seemed like box potatoes. For an appetizer I got the Ahi on Arugala. I expected a thicker slice, it came out so thin, you could almost see thru it. Overall. I would never come back."}
{"text":"This was a very nice experience in Scottsdale. The ambiance was great they had a band which was a little to loud it was sometimes hard to talk but other than that it was very nice inside. They had indoor and outdoor seating available. The service was very good and our food was excellent. The handcrafted pastas are the best! Great Italian food!"}
