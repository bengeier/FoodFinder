{"text":"Was surprised to find this little gem in Gastonia. Went looking for an Italian place with the gps so my niece could have pizza - so glad it found Milanos. The food was good, we had a personal pizza, hot sub and baked ziti.  None of us could finish our meals.

It was quiet, relaxing,  nice atmosphere with white table cloths and cloth napkins. The prices didn't seem to match the decor - and you paid as you left at the door.  A little strange considering the upscale environment. 

The staff were all adults and professional. Seems it would be great for a couples night out, meeting with friends, etc. Our 9-year-old was fine but we felt we needed to be quieter than we would normally be in a restaurant with her. Try it out- it's a great bargin with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like this place, too.  It's not expensive.  You get a lot of food for the money.  I love the stuffed shells with the house chianti.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  The decor is a little dated but I find it comforting like Grandma's house.  Good Italian food made by Greeks.  They do a good job."}
{"text":"If you stick with pizza, this place is good....BUT - don't ever order the lasagna!! It was the WORST lasagna I have ever had....it was a mess and it was a cheesey glob of noodles with NO taste!!! No thanks on that!!!"}
{"text":"Back in the 90's I used to think this place was great.  I moved away and when I moved back in 2014 I wanted to go to Milano's.  I told my BF what great food they had.  I was totally disappointed.  I agree with the others about it tasting like Chef Boyardee.  I even mentioned it when we were eating.  I began thinking that maybe it was just that night, so...I went back and was disappointed again.  Cross this place off my list of favorites."}
{"text":"When we lived in this area, we stopped here to eat. They always had a lot of cars outside. We asked our waiter about the food, and was it made in house. He told us there was no chef and everything was off the truck, even the bread was pre-made. We ordered anyway and we were very displeased. We never returned here in the six years we lived in the area. My advice is to take your money and spend it somewhere else, unless you like Chef Boyardee. There are other places in town that serve very good food/cuisine."}
{"text":"The service that our group received was horrible to say the least. We were seated in an empty room and had other groups to come in after us. We had to ask our waitress for a menu. After waiting for some time for our orders, the group that came in well after us received their meals in a timely manner, mind you two different groups of people came in after us and both were served before we were. It took them two hours to bring our food out. They were short staffed and very unprofessional. Our waitress had another person to help her, but they pulled her to another table to help out the group who were seated next to us. Why? I don't know. Mind you, they received their food before us and all of their orders were correct. When our food finally came out, half of the orders were incorrect, and some didn't receive their meals at all. The person who planned the gathering had to go to the kitchen to check on her order?! Is that not ridiculous?!! We asked to speak to the manager two different times, but she never came to check on the issue. A person from our table had to get up to go look for her and overheard her say, \"I don't care\" to one of the waitresses. That was icing on the cake. We were treated like crap from the start. The manager was so unprofessional to the point where I was sick on my stomach. This family owned business is the worst. I don't want to throw the race card out but if another set of people said the same thing about the staff while in line waiting to pay for our food, then there goes your answer. We didn't mind paying for our food, what was upsetting was the lack of unprofessionalism that we received on tonight. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The food here was really not to my liking.  The spaghetti sauce was bland and odd.  The veal was ok, nothing special - overall not worth the price, and the place is not that expensive."}
{"text":"Standard Americanized Italian food served up in huge portions.  The flavors were just ok and nothing really stood out.  The house chianti was very smooth and paired well with their pasta offerings.  Overall, probably not a restaurant we'd go back to."}
{"text":"Surprised in the gashouse to find Italian this good.  Salad was fresh and the dressing tasty.    Cheese bread was just Ok (as was the side spigehitti) but the real stand outs were the hot sandwiches...cheese steak was outstanding and the Chicken Francese...wow!"}
{"text":"Awful, Awful, Awful...

We didn't dine in, but instead ordered carry out because we were in the mood for Italian, but too tired to cook. 

Mistake. BIG mistake. HUGE. 

I'm not usually one to make bad reviews...but this place gave me, my son, my husband and my mother the shudders for a full two weeks afterwards. Not even exaggerating. This place left such a bad taste in all our mouths that we literally cringed. This place doesn't resemble Italian food in the least. Maybe someone who has never eaten, cooked or even SEEN Italian food might be fooled into thinking this was edible. It's not. 

The chicken parm tasted like someone tossed a grilled piece of chicken (not even breaded!) in Campbells TOMATO SOUP that someone dumped canned chili in. This was not spaghetti sauce. This was flat out tomato soup (with that weird creamy orange color and no seasoning) with some crumbly lumps of undefined meat. My son got the Veal house special....let's just say...no. NO.

The only saving grace was the two orders of tiramisu, which was obviously NOT made in house, and was still frozen. We let it thaw and ate that for dinner. The rest went into the garbage can. Save yourself the trouble and the expense. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"We two ate there on Sat. night.  Food was alright, but the service was below par.  Our stressed out older server wasn't very attentive.  She seemed stressed out-  maybe they were short of servers.  There were also two others in the front room.We received appetizers after salads.  Had to ask for water refill.  Dirty plates sat before us for at least 15 min.  Took a long time to receive the bill.  She offered to take card with bill, but took a while.  I sat in waiting area- server saw me, then asked if we prefer to pay in line.  We took the card and paid in line.  Didn't know the server takes it to main cashier-  paying line was long at this point.  The food was good, but not excellent.  I guess our only complaint was the particular server.  We may try it again."}
{"text":"We went to Milano's Italian Restaurant last night and I would have to say I was extremely dissapointed. This was our first time going to the restaurant and I can tell you it will be our last.  The food was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND! Nothing Italian about it unless you consider Chef Boyardee Italian food, as Milano's was more Bland than Chef Boyardee!

I got the Pollo Florentine and a margarita and my boyfriend got the Veal Parmesan.

The margarita was extremely salty and I am not talking about the salt on the rim, when drinking it with a straw it was super salty. 

The blue cheese dressing that came with the salad had no blue cheese flavor. 

The Pollo Florentine was bland, bland bland, there was no detectable seasoning at all. 

The Veal Parmesan was bland as well as the sauce on top. 

Both of our spaghetti sides were bland whatever pasta sauce they use had no flavor other than tomato. 

The waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu items or the price of my margarita.

We will not be going to this restaurant ever again. It is ashame because it looked so quaint and nice.  

We spent $40 and we could have had a much better meal somewhere else for much less."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants for over 20 years-I'm amazed anyone would give it less than 5 stars-I've eaten Italian food in Rome and New York and other major cities and this Greek family owned restaurant in Gastonia compares quite well,particularly considering it has such reasonable prices-You do have to know which dishes you like here:I have other favorite places for shrimp scampi and eggplant parmesan,for instance-Here I love the manicotti,lasagna and spaghetti with Italian sausage-The marinated chicken strips and steaks are great,too-I usually get angel hair pasta as a side instead of baked potato with them-And the blue cheese dressing is awesome-goes great with their fried mushrooms!There's a good reason the parking lot is full at night!"}
{"text":"Tacky... Decent food, probably high end for Gastonia. They do give you a lot of food for your money though."}
{"text":"I have been going to thus restaurant for 23 years. It is obvious to everyone that it has been going down hill. I have eaten here atleast twice a week for over 20 years. Sometimes more. 8 months ago I went with friends to eat. Our waitress was so high on something that she could barely function. It was even being dicussed among the employees and patrons. We were there for 3 1/2 hours. It was a horrible experience but it was my first so We still continued visiting.
Two weeks ago we visited..it was a Saturday night around 7.  .first.... The floor was so filthy. We were placed in \"the entertainment section\"..this is what we were told.
It was the same waitress! They hired her back. She then took our order on her knees. We got our salads ( that were made wrong) 20 minutes before our drinks. It took l hour and 5 minutes to get our food. It was wrong. We Ordered a pizza to go for the kids...she forgot to give the order to the kitchen. ..WAIT..it gets worse...
She then follows my friend out to the car to pick a fight with her. ..all while her customers are inside the restaurant.  I had to go in to tell the manager to come get her.  We still were charged full amount for our meal. I have kept my mouth shut about this. ..but I was told tonight that this waitress still works there and actually did this to someone else.
I will NEVER visit this restaurant again. I would not suggest it to anyone.  Ever."}
{"text":"My family from out of town seem to love this place. However, I'm pretty much w/everybody else on here.  The food is good; NOT great, but okay.  I think it's a little better than \"Chef Boyardee\" as some people say, but def not the best Italian I've ever had.  The service is Okay at best.  A little bit too....Cracker Barrel in a quiet Italian restaurant.  Decor is nice, but is dumbed down by some patrons & wait staff.  I live here, & I don't go. Nearby too.  Just not really that great at all."}
{"text":"Horrible, $32 for a lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs to go, even shorted me one salad. Pasta was a fresh tasted old, spaghetti sauce wasn't good! They need Chef Ramsay!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, AND DISGUSTING!! I will never eat there again. This is the first time I have ever written a review about a restaurant. But after the food I just got. I had to express this! I ordered a spaghetti with meat sauce and what I got was some sticky noodles with canned hotdog chili on top. I was totally disgusted and dissatisfied. The only reason I didn't take it back was because I had gotten home and the restaurant was closed by the time I looked at my food. My salad just consisted of lettuce. No tomatoes, no carrots NOTHING. For the money they charge they need to step up or shut down!"}
{"text":"From the get go I had my suspicions that it wouldn't be good but I was pleasantly surprised. Like most places you have to know what to order, and I'd say anything that doesn't have a red sauce with it. Angel hair pasta add shrimp? Ugh so good. One of my friends got the salmon which I sampled and was also delicious. I got the manicotti one time and was kinda let down. The sauce was rather tomato paste-ish. I'll keep coming here for the angel hair pasta which is amazing. Give it a try, I just recommend trying something with no tomato base. Lol"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Love their pizza! We went on a Friday night and had a short wait but it was worth it. Stephen was our server and he was great. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I found the Manicotti and Lasagna I ordered was as good as an okay tasting store bought frozen dinner and the portions were small.  I'm from NYC and I expect Italian food from a Italian restaurant to be fresh and a good portions."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Gastonia. Been eating here since I was a kid in high school. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I love this place. Great food, the sautéed mushrooms and meat raviolis are my favorite. The subs and chicken zita are also very very good."}
{"text":"Milanos is a family favorite in this house! Owner always there! Staff is great! We do takeout a lot! Grilled Chicken subs are incredible!! The pasta is outstanding and salads always fresh!!! They see us at least once a week!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst italian food I have ever had. When you get veal parm and it served with American cheese... enough said, sauce was terrible meatballs bland. I was beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great italian food and delicious ambiance... go to the grocery store, buy noodles and sauce, cook at home while watching a nice Italian-esque movie because that is better than this restaurant. The server was mediocre, nothing spectacular. The hostesses and other staff were way under par. Hostess wouldn't look up from her cell phone while we set up table, and when she called our name just pointed for us where to go... food was meh like I said... I've made better ravioli and spaghetti in a matter of minutes than the time it took get our watered down excuse for pasta."}
{"text":"Service was great. Prompt and super friendly. my boyfriend got the chicken piccata. It was pretty good, not as good as mine, but that's one of my specialties. I got chicken parmesan with meat sauce. The meat sauce was probably the worst I've ever had. I've seen reviews comparing it to Chef Boyardee, and I honestly think I like Chef Boyardee better. the chicken was perfectly cooked. It wasn't cooked in the style of chicken parmesan at all. I think it may have been cooked in a slow cooker, and it wasn't breaded, but it was delicious chicken nonetheless once I scraped off the meat sauce and the unrecognizable cheese. Despite the bad reviews and the terrible meat sauce ,  I would probably give them another try. It's the closest restaurant to my new house and they are always packed."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Had the sirloin steak and it was cooked perfectly. Our waiter wasn't rude nor friendly kind of in between but the service was excellent. She was on top of everything. Chicken parm was also good. Their dressings are fantastic"}
{"text":"As a former employee, I don't understand all these bad reviews. Milanos puts out good food on a consistent basis. My favorites are eggplant parm, salmon, tuna sub and the lunch special \"Spaghetti Parm & Shrimp\"

All the staff including servers, cooks, etc. work hard everyday to give every patron a good experience.

Milano's has a comfortable laid back atmosphere, and once you are in a booth you are in no hurry to leave.

Milano's has been in business for over 27 years and they are a solid establishment. They rock on consistency and cleaniliness.

Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the area...  I use to eat here almost 20 years ago, I now live in Lake Norman and make the drive to eat here. The decor has not changed in 20 years, I think the same plastic plants are still hanging on the walls. Overlooking that the service is great, and I have never had anything bad to eat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend really loves this place....I mean really loves this place. It's a great little Italian restaurant that serves up large portions for a great price.

The lunch crowd is usually hopping here so try to get here early or late during  the lunch hours. It has a good amount of seating though, so the line will move pretty quickly. They have your regular Italian food, so expect all of your favorites here. But the serving sizes here are pretty large & will fill even the hungriest stomach in the room. I'm a big fan of the meat ravioli, along with the lasagna. You really can't go wrong here with any dish as it's all pretty good.

The prices here are great, with nothing too expensive to where lunch hurts your wallet. It's a great place to grab a great Italian lunch, because who doesn't like Italian. Walking in, you'll think the place may be too nice for lunch, but the decor really doesn't match up too well with the place. Maybe for dinner, the decor fits well, but for lunch it's really just too much.
But I like Milano's for lunch, especially when I'm in the mood for great Italian."}
{"text":"Don't call in your orders at Milanos. Whoever is taking them will usually put you on hold for 20 minutes, even in the middle of placing it.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"Lots of food at a good price.  Red sauce is way different than the normal and goes great with the garlic bread.  If you're not in the mood for pasta try the sandwiches - the grilled chicken finger sandwich is great."}
{"text":"They took my favorite off the menu. I loved their tuna sub and now its gone 
The interior is still the same decor. Old and dated dark. The bar is right in the dining room so it can feel overwhelmingly when there are several people there
I was in the mood for spaghetti so I stopped in here. It is very close to where I live
The salad was small and I'm sure it was bottled dressing 
The pasta was mushy. Over cooked and i had forgotten that the sauce tastes canned 
It is so close to home and I wish I could eat there but there is no life or caring to anything 
The dishes made by line cooks and no chef inspiration 
They have their local regulars but if you want more than chef boy r de then skip this place 
New Italian restaurant in town is much better"}
{"text":"I'm not hard to please. And I rarely post reviews. This place however, is NOT Italian food. This is southern food trying to be Italian. The atmosphere is inviting, the service was a little to be desired, that is if you could find your waitress, I will give you a hint, when you hand off the check don't disappear for 15 mins. I had chicken parm and it was like someone poured chef boyarde sauce on top of country fried chicken. I was first enticed because of how the place was packed full of people every weekend, and when I finally left I was mostly confused. On a scale of 1-10 with just the food I make at home being a 10. This stuff is a 2. Would not recommend. Would enthusiastically caution anyone from going. Stay at home and eat a hot pocket, better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for a seminar with a free meal. Although we had a limit selection to choose from. We chose the chicken parmigiana, with which we a salad bread and all the water we could drink. The salad was okay...iceberg lettuce a little red cabbage, onion, green pepper, and tomato, choice of dressing. Then they brought out the garlic bread, wife had chosen plain bread which they didn't get her even after asking a second time. The chicken parmigiana was the brought out and I do have to say was a very large portion. The chicken was a breast which had been baked, and was not breaded, with some melted cheese on it. Both the chicken and the pasta had a thick meat sauce over them. The meat sauce was pretty bland and tasteless but the chicken was just plain terrible. I can't really describe the taste but it was dry and tuff.  .  I could only eat one one bite of the chicken and not much of the pasta."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti in the area! We always drive from Charlotte to here so we can have some yummy food! Salad is always so fresh. Love the tiramisu as well! Nice management and staffs!"}
