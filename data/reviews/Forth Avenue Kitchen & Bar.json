{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant. Food amazing , ambience great and the service excellent. It's run by a really kind and engaging couple. It's a very nice upscale night out and we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love Forth Ave. Drinks selection is great, service is great, and my wife and I have had basically everything on the menu and it's all just really good.  You can't ask for a better place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Don't even read the menu. Just order the fried chicken. :-) Okay, go ahead and read the menu and then order the fried chicken.  Judging by the other diners around me who didn't order the fried chicken, the other food is just as good.  I had the chocolate budino for dessert. It's chocolate pudding with a topping of caramel and hazelnuts topped with a dollop of (real) whipped cream. It is just as delicious as it sounds. The service is very friendly. When I arrived I asked the waitress if the music could be turned down. Two minutes, the manager turned down the music! I was very impressed. I have been there three times now and every time the food and service was all I could wish for."}
{"text":"By far the most perfect omelette of my life. Light and fluffy, with a high rise and not even a hit of brown. Filled with beautifully roasted mushrooms and aged cheddar, this is the omelette dreams are made of...."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner with awesome service. We took our 1 year old daugther and her grandparents, and the service was awesome. The food was great, we had a flatbread, steak, burger and a pasta - all of it was terrific. Highly recommend for a nice family dinner, intimate date, or a beer at the bar top. Really, really appreciated the super service, the waitress even offered her own tupperware to give our toddler's dinner on, because we forgot ours. If you go with a baby, make sure to ask about the accessible washroom with the change table - it's not obvious but they do have one."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place - food, ambience, service, and of course drinks.  It is another addition to a growing number of cool places to eat and drink in East Danforth.   Have had brunch and dinner there and neither disappointed.  For dinner there were 4 in our party and everyone had something different and we were all blown away.  What a great addition to the 'hood.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully designed-  it really is nice... Unfortunately the experience and food wasn't good.  We were a party of 6.  Our orders came out incorrectly - something that can easily happen, so no problem.  Onions on the burger when we said no onions, fruit when we asked for potatoes... The hamburger was way, way under cooked and the man who ordered it said it was the greasiest burger he'd ever had.  Then I found eggshells in the veggie eggs Benedict.  The response?  Not even an apology - just took the plate.  Although the place wasn't busy our coffee wasn't refilled once.  The check came and was incorrect. I really want this place to succeed as we need more great restaurants in the 'hood but they need to focus as much on food and service as the decor.  The good news?  The Benny (minus shells) was good and the waffle was pretty good too (although you can see the Kirkland bottle of syrup in the kitchen which is advertised as \"really good syrup\" on the menu...)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on my birthday. I chose this spot initially because they had a lot of little apps for sharing which sounded delicious. We were initially the only people there but the place filled in fast as the night went on. I ordered the pink kitty drink - vodka, raspberry sour puss and lemonade which was just Ok.  We ordered a bunch of different apps - pieorgies, pork dumplings, and warm olives with pita. They were all excellent, hand made with delicious sauces for each. It was appetizer heaven. The only downfall is they took forever to bring them. Service out of the kitchen was initially quite slow.  We ordered our mains, I ordered the fish and chips, my husband ordered the gnocchi, my mom ordered the capellini with scallops and my sister the burger. My fish was excellent with hand made tarter sauce, the fries were fresh cut and covered in some garlicky deliciousness. My husband demolished his gnocchi. Everyone really enjoyed their food.  Our server was attentive and very nice (and he told us it was his first day there - he did an excellent job).  In the end I will definitely be back - especially to sample some more of those delicious appetizers!"}
{"text":"This is a great place: the menu is small but everything on it is super delicious! We love this place for Brunch and everything on the Brunch Menu is delicious.  The beet salad from Lunch menu is amazing! The service is great, the place is clean.  Because this place is new, about a year old, not too many people know about it, so there is no wait to get a table on the weekend.  You are not driving downtown and finding parking, there are free parking on the side streets and ultimately the food and service are top notch - it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Erin and team keep place running smooth. Food is alway good and lots of it. The soups are always nice can't say enough about the sticky ribs and the potato salad that they come with plate is always cleared. Love the fried chicken and anything else I have had over my many visits. Prices are reasonable especially for the portions never leave hungry that is for certain. Make certain to call for reservation as they do fill up but service and quality are always top notch."}
{"text":"I was excited to stroll along the Danforth and see a new brunch spot in the neighbourhood! Today, we stopped in to check out the scene and try our brunch favourite: the eggs benny.  THE GOOD: - Service was good overall. Our servers were very polite and we were served quickly.  - The place has a trendy, clean and upscale vibe - think Local 1794 (down the street) but less bar-y and more restaurant-y. It's great to have more options like this in the neighbourhood.  - I would give my eggs benny a solid 4/5. I don't know what they put in their hollandaise sauce, but this was easily the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had: thick, creamy and all around scrumptious. If I could, I would dunk my head in a bin of this stuff or take a bath in it - it's that good.   THE BAD: - Probably my miss for not making note of this when ordering, but I prefer my eggs benny with very soft, runny eggs. I want the yolk to ooze out and mix with the hollandaise sauce to make a heavenly concoction all over the bacon, you know? These eggs were just a little overcooked.  - I thought the prices were a little on the high side - $15 for an eggs benny is high in this neck of the woods.   All in all, if you're in this part of town and want to try the best hollandaise sauce of your life, be sure to check out Forth Avenue."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are so friendly and the food is exceptional. You can really tell that they put a lot of love and care into each and every plate that gets delivered to a table. It's such a joy to see such a lovely place in our own neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! So great to see some new spots on the Danforth. We started with the Octopus, short ribs, and the charcuterie platter. The octopus literally melted in my mouth. The others loved the short ribs and the small platter had a little of everything.  My main was the spring veggie gnocchi. Was lovely. Gnocchi was perfect. Hubby had the fish and chips, said they were great, would have them again. Others had the spaghetti with Bolognese and the chicken supreme. Both were happy with their meals. We had the warm donuts for dessert. If I had of known how great they would be, I would have ordered a couple of plates. They were amazing. Will definitely be back, if only for the octopus and the donuts."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch: it is so good and nobody knows about it. I'm amazed that we continue to walk in and easily grab a seat by the window, get wonderful friendly service and enjoy deliciously satisfying brunch with great coffee and great music (today lots of surf rock Americana). At first it was fun to not have their brunch \"discovered\" in a way that let us always get a seat, but we are done being selfish and The Forth deserves your business.   Go for brunch on a Sunday. The Eggs Benny is consistently fantastic."}
{"text":"Forth Avenue Kitchen & Bar represents the further gentrification of East Danforth. It is very much a diamond in the rough. This place is polished and hip to current trends. With light woods, metals, and industrial style lighting all adding to its charm. The higher prices are reflective of this fact, but the quality of the food and the excellent service justifies it in my mind. There are other cheaper options in the surrounding area, so it's nice to have a more upscale option to treat yourself with on occasion.   I went for brunch on a Saturday morning and ordered the mushroom omelette with home fries with a side of fruit.  The omelette was perfection - A beautiful yellow with delicious mushrooms and aged cheddar. The home fries were crisp on the outside, but tender on the inside. Gordon Ramsay would be proud! I asked for some hot sauce and one of the cooks came with his homemade hot sauce and explained to me that it was made with chilis from his garden. Quite simply, the food here is delicious and well thought out.  My experienced was heightened with the excellent service provided. The server was extremely friendly and consistently topped-up my coffee and ensured that I had everything I needed. Two different cooks came to visit me and inquire about my experience and offer some more information about the food.  All of my interactions with the staff were pleasant and they were kind and quick, so as to make me feel appreciated, but not hover over me.  I'm very happy with my decision to try this place and will certainly be back again for not only another brunch, but also to experience the nighttime atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a takeout meal for two, overpriced, tasteless and really disappointing."}
{"text":"Fantastic Add to the Neighbourhood! This is the second time we have been to this great restaurant and we were greeted with polite and personable staff and owners.  The atmosphere is upbeat and friendly - definitely our type of place.  So, the food... Fantastic!  We ordered the charcuterie board and it was probably the best charcuterie board that we have ever had!  Everything was very fresh and top quality (triple cream brie, and locally produced meats (naturally fead and no antibiotics)). We ordered the fresh made warm donuts - wow!  Crazy tasty! The selection wine and beer was good, and always improving and refining the offerings.  Welcome to the neighbourhood!  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Would recommend trying this place out!  Just shy of 5 stars only because our server could have been a little more attentive but was prompt overall.   Portions are healthy sized."}
{"text":"Came here one night with my boyfriend to try it out. Definitely a great place! It is a little tight so I recommend making reservations. We were lucky enough to get a table at the window. We both had the grass fed steak with fries and it was delicious. We had some other appetizers too which were also really good such as the beet salad and the ricotta, prosciutto and arugula on crostini. Overall great food. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Comfortable and quiet location, good music but at a level that allows for conversation. First time in and had to try the burger, excellent quality top to bottom, but no special zip, if you like a good plain burger and fries this is a great place to relax and enjoy it. I'll be back to try other items."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.   My husband and I went for dinner last week and we loved it. We had trouble deciding what to get and ended up sharing a bunch of appetizers together.   We got the small charcuterie platter to start which was pretty large for being a small. The meats are all local and it came with some homemade jam too.   We also had the beet salad- SUPER DELICIOUS. I can't describe it you just have to try it. It is one of their best sellers.  We tried the pierogies as well. They are handmade and come with the best onions and sauce. And they're also very large.  The braised short ribs were so tender and flavourful and came with a potatoe salad that I really enjoyed.  The chef also came out and gave us a free dish of heirloom tomatoe and cheese. He grows the tomatoes in his own garden and you can taste the difference for sure.   Overall we were super stuffed and super satisfied.   The service was great and the food was even better. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stellar service and the Fried chicken...omg! It's incredible! Stopped before dessert...couldn't eat anymore"}
{"text":"It makes me so happy to discover a gem like this place in a quite neighbourhood.   The waitress was friendly and attentive. The decor was modern yet warm and welcoming. The place was not too dark nor bright (perfect lighting). The music was not too loud or annoying. A clean washroom and a corridor.   Moving on to the menu and food.  Have to say it is a small menu but I prefer a small menu over an extensive one. It means they have focus on making fewer dishes with fresh ingredients and more attention. I did some research before coming, so I knew what to order. We started with a small charcuterie platter ($18) and beet salad ($9) to share. Everything on the board was fresh and flavourful. Such a nice selection of local cured meats and cheese. It was a lot of food considering it is a small. It is a good sized app to share between 2 people. The beet salad was refreshing! Wish there was a bit more acidity to it to bring out more flavours, but still a solid dish. We shared one main dish as we wanted to save some room for dessert. We ordered fried chicken dinner ($19), and it was a perfect choice. The dish had four boneless fried chicken pieces, one house made biscuit, generous amount of silky mashed potatoes and green beans with gravy and coleslaw. Wow every single component was cooked/prepared to the perfection. Chickens were just light and fluffy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The biscuit was seasoned perfectly and buttery. To finish off, we shared a flourless chocolate cake ($6) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream ($2). Oh boy that cake was decadent, rich and super chocolate-y. But the ice cream was a bit disappointing. It lacked vanilla flavour and the creamy texture of good ice cream.   Overall, we had a great time here and enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. We would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great weekday meal here! Fried chicken portion is huge but delicious! Friends had roasted chicken and a pasta but I know they were salivating for my fried chicken, served with creamy mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy. Savvy wine list with some reasonably priced wines. Excellent choices for this location.  Clean, unpretentious, delicious, friendly. Thrilled that they are close to where we live!  We will definitely be back.  Very cool little strip of restaurants and pubs \"east of east\" Danforth! (The Shore Leave and The Linsmore!) Check them out!"}
{"text":"This strip of Danforth has been *dying* for more places like this. Good on the owners for realizing the potential here and taking a chance. We went a couple of weeks ago on a cold Friday night. Although the place was full, they were more than accommodating. We sat at the bar and they served us a couple of drinks. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the different beers they had on tap. I noticed that they also had a good wine list too. A table soon freed up and they helped us move. First dish..  we had the jalapeno poppers - they were juicy and spicy at the same time - a fantastic start. For the main event, we each ordered the burger and WOW.. it was truly amazing: Juicy, tender, tasty and done exactly the way a good burger should be. The fries were really good too. The service was spot-on, especially given the fact that they haven't been open very long. We were never made to feel rushed at all. Casual and trendy at the same time is how I would describe this place. The music noise level was decent and to my surprise, they actually played a really decent selection of music. We will definitely be returning - and this time with friends - because now we've really got something to brag about on Danforth East! :)"}
{"text":"This review is lengthy because this place is AWESOME!! After seeing a few comments on how great this place is, on a local social media forum, my wife and I decided to see what all the hype was about, and are we glad we did. We were blown away. I just hope this place gets the recognition it really deserves.   The Service. As soon as we walked in, my wife and I were met by the lovely hostess, without hesitation, greeted us sincerely and warmly. After some feedback, she seated us in a nice cozy spot. Although the seating is a little close to other tables, I never felt like our personal space was invaded for a second. You're close, and could have a friendly conversation with others (which of course I did at one point - to help a group with their photo) but for the most part, you'll enjoy your space, guaranteed. This leads me to decor and layout. But before I get there, our server was a nice cool guy, very pleasant. It was awesome having the chef serve us our appetizer and explain its cheeses and meats too.  Decor. As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you'll see two tables on the main level, just two your right, and two tables on one step (almost balcony-ish), for a total of 4 tables. I have to admit, the way they placed them is interesting. Without getting into specifics, you'd be comfortable sitting at any of these tables whether you're a couple, a group of three or a group of 4. And since we're talking about seating, you could sit at the bar by yourself (or another table) and be quite content. The bar is long, and seems interactive and comfortable enough. My only regret is not seeing the back of the place, but it appeared that you could seat a nice large group back there. Even the downstairs where the washrooms are, are equally impressive and clean as the upstairs. The stairs connecting the main floor and basement are angled well too, unlike some other stores in older establishments. Obviously these people care greatly about decor and safety.  Food. Holy S--T. Like C'mon, what the hell? Did I just die and go to heaven? Ok the appetizer 'Cheese and Carcutarie' was great. Powerful tastes. The cheeses, cured meats, jam, and pickled vegetables with the toast (see my picture) is reason enough to dine here. Paired with a good alcoholic beverage, and you'd be set for a good after work day snack. We had a salad each as our main. My wife had the Beet salad. My wife says it was a hearty, flavorful and filling salad with goat cheese well paired with pistachio pesto. I had the Nicoise Salad, and have never had anything like it. I'm pretty sure it had an organic egg (most flavorful egg I've ever eaten - and I REALLY like eggs) along with a well vinegarred cut up potatoe, and of course the pan seared (melt in your mouth) tuna. We had their fries with dinner too. Well sized, not greasy and made me feel like I was eating a potatoe but it was fun, and tasty. There could've been more side sauce, but wife says \"don't be a greedy guts\"!! Like she knows best pfffft.   Price point, I'd say this place is definitely fair to other places. Although I enjoy other local venues, I'd have to say this is my favourite amongst some other familiar places like Melanie's Bistro, Local 1794, The Borough, etc. Whatever you do.....enjoy yourself.  Thanks for taking the time to read this. Cheers."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.   I have been four times and enjoyed all my meals.  Has a good selection of beers and cocktails.  The menu is well curated.  I have had the french and bourbon sour cocktails (both delicious), beef carpaccio, pastas, and flatbreads.   Overall atmosphere and service is relaxed and attentive.  Seems family friendly as I have seen people come with their kids."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant in this upcoming neighborhood. Service was great and speedy, food was first rate and locally sourced, ambiance was perfect, extensive kids menu and good value to boot. Local 1794 down the road has some stiff competition!"}
