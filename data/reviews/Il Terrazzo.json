{"text":"Wow, and not in a good way.  At age 50, I have been to a lot of restaurants in my life.  And the last couple years flying more than 100k miles a year for business I have dined at restaurants all over the US and Canada.  This was one of the worst dining experiences ever at a restaurant with a pedigree, this is not the freaking Waffle House (oh by the way I have been to The waffle house and it was better than this place ).  Not the food....the service.. we went with friends at 8pm on a Saturday night... really on the weekend you should be on your A game.  This is a beautiful resort ( The Phoenician) so as a new Phoenix area resident I was excited to visit.  The first omen of doom was when we (4) arrived at 8:05 for our 8 pm reservation and had to wait several minutes before we were escorted to our table past an empty bar and a less than half full dining area.... then after an extended wait someone asked if we wanted water..  By the way the water sucks in AZ so skip the tap water and help the environment.  Then after an extended wait our waiter cruised by and took our cocktail order... pretty simple order... no one in bar....close to 15 minutes before drinks arrived... I could have gone behind the bar and poured them in  5...oh my friend ordering a drink asks for extra lime slices... of course no extra limes come...gotta ask again AND after an extended wait (you seeing a theme here?) limes appear.  waiter finally comes by for us to order...two steaks for the friends an order of pasta for me and my daughter had fish....now we WAIT.....everyone finishes their drinks but where is the waiter?  The place is near empty....So is the bar...we ask the cat pouring the water to send the waiter over..After an extended wait he wanders by and looks shocked that we want another round after only 25 minutes. Oh, wait...the calamari appetizers took forever as well.  Octopus is not indigenous to the valley so they weren't out fishing.   Now this is critical to the story...we ordered sides... one grilled asparagus..two broccollini.  Our friends steaks arrived along with the broccollini.  My daughter and I have nothing.....AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME....where we are begging our friends just to eat their steaks some woman comes out and says there has been a mistake and our dishes should be out promptly....well not that prompt but it arrived finally and was dangerously hot, but tasty.  So my friend finishes her steak and announces she is done and what arrives 25 minutes into dinner??? The grilled asparagus she had ordered as a side..  by this time we are wondering if there are hidden cameras and we are on America's Worst Restaurants....it is PAINFUL......Waiter 101 says you should check on your customers frequently....not at IL Terrazzo. It was pitiful.... It would have been funny but it was damn expensive.  AWFUL EXPERIENCE.  No apologies from the staff, no hey can we give you a comp dessert, or really sorry how about we take care of the drinks.... Hey what can we do to make it better.. We all have been to places that acknowledge problems and try to solve them.. NOPE, not at Il Terrazzo.... This must be their standard operating procedure.  As God is my witness I will live in the Phoenix area for the rest of my life and I will never go back to Il Terrazzo, as a matter of fact I doubt I will visit the Phoenician either. I use yelp all the time when I travel.... Stay away from this train wreck.  Lots of other good places in Scottsdale. Learn from our mistake... Really, even if you stay at the resort explore the city and eat somewhere else.  Oh I forgot, they give you bread.  we ate the bread, it was not a lot of bread ... we asked for more bread...  you got it!  No more bread for you!.....  The Il terrazzo nazi!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I don't like to post bad reviews, but the service, food AND ambiance was sub par. The music was only playing inside, so if you had a table outside like we did,  It was like eating at a library...a library where all you hear are plates clinking all around you constantly.  We had a 2:00 seating, which was the last seating of the day. Had I known the that sushi that was placed on ice directly in sunlight was gonna be mushy and warm I would not have waited in the line to get it. Then, on to the charcuterie station. Dried meats and cheeses...YUM! The only thing that looked safe to eat was the giant prawns. They were really good, I ate like 10 of them cause I was trying to get my moneys worth haha. The desert station was also very good.  I have had better brunches for $20 at places like Talking Stick Resort! The Christmas Day brunch here was $110 per person with an additional 18% gratuity added. So $129.80 per person.   I worked in the hospitality biz for a long time and I certainly don't mind tipping. I usually tip on average 30%. I tip a minimum of 20% and that is if service is bad. Also, because I understand there are a lot of reasons why things go wrong and some of the time it is out of the servers control. I'n not sure what the problem was, but I sat with dirty plates on my table, empty glasses of water and drinks the entire hour I was eating. I literally had to get up and walk to the host stand to request two cups of coffee, then had to get up AGAIN, walk to the host stand to request our $297.00 bill. So, we tipped our server like $40 for stopping by to say \"Hi\" .......seems like a great gig for her, not so much for the customer!  I tried to speak with the Andy Garcia look alike manager, but he was too busy directing all of his attention to he very attractive hostess that suddenly took over our servers entire station. I would say that her stepping in to help out was the best service we had at Il Terrazzo during our entire visit.   Not good, won't be back or recommend. I still plan to visit the beautiful multi-level pool as soon as the weather allows. I go there a few times a season and have always had the impeccable service you would expect from the The Phoenician Resort."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, and dining on the patio was so pleasant. There was no problem hearing your table's conversation despite there being plenty of other people there. I had a cocktail made of coconut water, which was refreshing without being too sweet. The spinach and artichoke dip and the calamari were the best I've had. I would also wholeheartedly recommend the Caesar salad, the lamb chops, and the chocolate cake. It's a perfect place for a special meal!"}
{"text":"Been here for dinner and brunch I have to say skip dinner and come here for Sunday brunch buffet offers excellent food great place to hang out with the girlfriends after massage or just to walk around and look at their art collection and many waterfalls   Dress code: casual"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  My friend had a large pitcher of water dropped on her.  The restaurant didn't even comp her a dessert.  Food was good but it took our party 3 1/2 hours to get through dinner.  Unwanted ice bucket challenge!!!"}
{"text":"Wholly cow, what a bunch of snooters.  My wife and I are in Scottsdale for a few days and I Google best views of sunset in Scottsdale and up pops the restaurant at the top of the Phonecian.  We go there and get seated around a fire pit, nice.  So we ask if we can order appetizers where we are seated.  The waiter says he will check and returns and says yes.  We go to order and are told no we were misinformed and we can't order food.  What the heck.  I question the waiter who sends the manager over.  The manager has the people skills of a rock and with the stone face of a zombie tells us we can't order appetizers.  This place should not advertise that they are open to the public because all they cater to are snooters."}
{"text":"We live near the Phoenician and have always had wonderful dining and hotel services/experiences. Until tonight. We booked Il Terrazzo for three for the Thanksgiving dinner.   The service was AWFUL from the minute we arrived. The host was confused and distracted. He took my name then turned his back on me without letting me know when we would be seated or what was going on. They confused us for another party and stopped us halfway to our table to redirect us to another area of the restaurant.  It took forever for the waitress to come back to our table after initially greeting us so I ordered wine from the bus boy. We waited another ten minutes for the waitress to return to take our order.  Our first course came out and it was forgettable. We asked for bread and it was dropped off. Five minutes later the bus boy came by to inform us the differences in the bread he served. A little strange. Our main courses were delicious but it took 15 minutes to clear our plates. Dessert came and they all tasted pretty awful., especially the bland pumpkin cake. Then it took another 15 minutes to get our check - after we had already asked for it because we were sick of waiting.  I should add that the restaurant was only half full. Overall a very disappointing experience, especially considering the price. Maybe the hotel has changed hands. Think we will try Royal Palms next year."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a terrific meal here but the best part was the wonderful service. We were first greeted by Raul who had such a friendly face and was so pleasant. Our server Zoe was incredible! She always made sure to stop by our table to check on us and made fabulous food suggestions. Our appetizers and entrees were absolutely delicious but our true favorite was the \"Phoenicians\" iced tea and the creme brûlée. Arturo also served us and was a true delight and a great member of our wonderful serving trio. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I apologize for the delay of this review but circumstances prevented me from writing it sooner.  I took my wife to Il Terrazzo for Mothers day and the service and food was very poor quality. We had heard this was going to be an exceptional experience, little did we realize it was going to be notable for the wrong reasons.  Much of what was to be hot, was cold, Music that was blasting through very poor speakers made conversation almost impossible and their follow up to our complaint was as unsatisfactory as the dining experience.  I contacted the restaurant and received a very nice note expressing an apology and invitation to return at their expense. Health issues prevented me from accepting the offer for a few months.  Once my health returned I contacted Mike Lee the GM who had been our previous contact.    Funny thing this time he chose to ignore my email, not even the courtesy of saying the offer was no longer extended.  So they now have taken a bad dining experience and made the entire situation even more irritating.    They may well be a great restaurant but from our perspective we could have gotten the same treatment at Denny's, it just would not have been as expensive."}
{"text":"WHAT A GREAT PLACE FOR KIDS!!!!  I came here tonight to dine and what a surprisingly kid friendly place. I thought there would be no place to bring the kids in a fancy, upscale restaurant like this, but there were other toddlers yelling and screaming in the bar. So I let my kids run around too.  I'm sure nobody in the dining area minded. And even the teens get a great place to hang out adjacent to the bar! Tonight was American Idol night, and they let us turn up the volume on the TV sets in the dining area. Just a little louvred door was pulled shut to help quiet the 80 decibel noise from the guests. I'm sure they didn't mind. The food was deeee lish!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views, the 40 dollar summer menu was a great deal. The ravioli with pesto sauce was one of the best pastas I have tried, the flank steak and chocolate cake were also very good. I shall definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Stuffy, overpriced, and boring!  We went for breakfast (because it appeared there was no other on resort options).  We were greeted by a formal gentleman in a suit and immediately felt as if we were in a courthouse and not a restaurant for breakfast.  We sat on the outdoor patio which was very nice.  The service was fine.  The food was totally boring and COMPLETELY OVERPRICED.  Breakfast for 3 was $85.00!  Get a grip!  We left the resort the next day and ventured in to town where we found a GREAT local place."}
{"text":"The hostess could have been a little friendlier, but other than that, the service was great.  The portions were large and the food was good, but it was nothing to rave about.  I would get the fritto misto and arugula and endive salad again.  Something to note, in case your waiter doesn't mention it (ours did): The linguine Nero is made with squid ink pasta. The squid ink gives the pasta nice texture. It also makes the pasta black, which is kind of grosses me out, even though the flavor is pretty much the same.  (Some people think it adds a mild fishy/seafoody flavor, but I've never noticed much of a flavor difference when squid ink is added to something.)"}
{"text":"If you have out of town guests and need a special place for dinner, consider Il Terrazzo. It's \"resort casual\" dining, meaning the setting is elegant (even romantic) but you can get away with wearing jeans. The dinner menu is set up for a progressive dining experience. You can choose a starter, second course, main course and dessert, or you can mix and match for as large or small a meal as you want. They have a decent selection of wines by the glass - domestic and Italian - so that you could have different varietals with each course.   We started with the cheese plate - the choices were okay, not too special, but the accompanients were greats, especially the 25-year aged balsamic. For the second course, I had the agnolotti pasta stuffed with goat cheese and thyme. It's not served with any kind of sauce but eat them quickly or they'll get a little oily. My friend opted for the Lattuga del Burro - butter lettuce salad with buttermilk gorgonzola dressing, pancetta and baby tomatos. My main course was the Ossobuco with saffron rissotto - fall off the bone tender and fantastic flavor although a few bites of the rissotto were a little crunchy (undercooked). You can get any of the dishes on the pasta course as a main course size.  The ricotta cheese cake, hazelnut praline mousse and house-made ice creams are delectable, so save room for dessert.  They serve breakfast and lunch as well, which should be impressive based on what we saw at dinner."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere so much, Presentation of dishes was beautiful. But we were a little disappointed on the food. We felt it was more of the fluff rather than the taste. Best dish on the menu was the squid pasta."}
{"text":"Solid dinner. Traveling solo for work, had a nice time. Highlights: the waiter - pleasant, called me ms. Tarrant (I still can't believe I can pass for a real adult, makes me giggle), the olives & olive oil for the bread were excellent, seabass was really good. Didn't have dessert. They don't rush you, I liked the atmosphere. It's a nice place but not stuffy."}
{"text":"Don't believe what you read about the famous Phoenician Sunday Brunch. Just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the Scottsdale area. I had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the Sunday Brunch since I've heard so much hype about it from local reviewers. I, myself, have never been there but I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out while entertaining guests. I mean, it's the prestigious Phoenician, so what could go wrong.  The Brunch is $45 per person, so you can only imagine what a grand display they would have. I mean, the Wynn in Las Vegas charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant display of cuisines. At the Phoenician Brunch, the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the Holiday Inn complimentary breakfast (which is free by the way). They had custom made omelettes, cereal, assorted pastries, and standard breakfast fare (bacon, potatoes, eggs, and fruit). But that's it. That's all the breakfast buffet offered. The lunch portion is a 3 course menu affair. It consisted of an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The appetizers offered sounded good but were not prepared very well. The main courses were decent but not for the price you pay. The desserts come out in a tower for the entire table to pick off of. They, too, were decent but not for the price you pay. The only thing that the Phoenician lived up to its reputation is the service. It was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel. However, I wasn't paying for service. I wanted to pay for a high-end, quality brunch. So if you just want to be treated like royalty (and pay like royalty) yet served less than royal food, this is the place for you. As for me, I can wait to hit up Vegas again. More value for my money out there especially in these economic times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed dinner at Il Terrazzo this weekend.   We sat in a cozy booth that was somewhat private considering the lack of guests in the restaurant.  I was surprised how dead it was inside the restaurant, but then  I realized the majority of people choose to eat outside on the patio, which has a great view. We enjoyed a bottle of wine from their rather extensive wine list.  The service was great.  The food was excellent.  The prices were reasonable.  I would definitely go back here for another quiet romantic dinner with my man.  You could enjoy a great inexpensive dinner OR really indulge in a fancy meal.   Either way, plan to spend some time there.   It's a slow paced, enjoy your meal restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I got the truffle risotto each time I went.  Service is just okay. The waiters are slow and not attentive. They are also pushy and remind you to tip them. It's very awkward. Last time I went, there was a dead cockroach sitting next to my sandal, thank God I discovered it after my meal.  Nice atmosphere but service and food don't match, probably wouldn't be back two times was one time too many."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks because I was too lazy to hail a cab to go off resort.  To my surprise, the experience was very pleasant, and commensurate with the resort itself.  The restaurant offers some unique, delicious cocktails, including an assortment of bellinis.  Memory hazy on the details....  I had the pork milanese, which tasted like chicken-fried pork chop, bone in.  Interesting.  Goes good with drinks.  Did I mention an assortment of bellinis?"}
{"text":"I had the best steak I've had in a long time. I'm on a low sodium diet, and the waitress was very helpful and accommodating. The staff was very attentive, the atmosphere is beautiful. I sat outside on the patio. And the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The best of the best at this 5 star resort.  Sunday brunches were held here plus other seasonal events overlooking the beautiful terrace.  Now it is Mowry and Cotton and I hope the Phoenician continues to keep up its iconic traditions."}
{"text":"Pretty good looking place, but whoa!!!  Food is mediocre at best, except the one salad with the walnuts and cherries!  Caesar salad was so tasteless that I started playing doctor to make it better and then gave up. All of our entrees were uninspiring.  The chef needs to go back to school!"}
{"text":"We had the breakfast buffet. There were plenty of choices including an omelet station. Things were fine except Jose did not bring us our drinks. I had to flag someone else down to get our drinks toward the end of the meal. Food is good. Service not as good."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior decor, too bad the food isn't as good as the decor.   My friend ordered the breakfast burrito, which looked OK. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, expecting a somewhat hearty portion. Instead, I received what amounted to two wafer thin slices and a very little meat with two eggs over easy for $15  To say I was disappointed is an understatement. If you're staying here or find yourself here, make the extra effort and get offsite to places around Scottsdale. It will be worth on your wallet and your appetite."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this restaurant, located in the Phoenician Resort.   Our first visit to Il Terrazzo was for a weekday lunch on our first day in town. We went out to the back patio to enjoy the surroundings. The back patio is definitely highly recommended, especially on nice days! We had an overall good experience even though service was a little slow. We were in no rush, though.   My family shared the Kobe Beef burger ($16) and the chicken parmesan sandwich. The kobe beef burger (cooked medium) was definitely the better choice. My parents loved it! We also enjoyed the truffle garlic fries that came with the meals. The chicken parmesan was looking a little sad... the breast came unevenly distributed in the bread and the sauce just didn't look as fresh. I definitely recommend the kobe beef burger.   We also came here for a Sunday brunch. It's definitely pricier, but we were in the mood to lounge rather than to go seek out a restaurant outside of the resort! Two of us had the $35 pre-fixe and two had the $25 breakfast buffet. The buffet is pretty standard (omelet bar, fruit, sausage, eggs) but the nice addition was the smoked salmon and tomatoes in martini glasses. Of the pre-fixe meal items, we had the calamari and the ahi tuna w/ asparagus for appetizers, and the steak frites and the shrimp mac and cheese. The portions were fairly big, I thought. (Maybe I just have a small stomach for mac and cheese?) The frites were different than the truffle garlic fries that we had for lunch, so that was a little disappointing. Overall tasty, but not mind-blowing. Food was kind of on the heavy side for those of us used to eating lighter.  We finished off the brunch with a tower of dessert, which included macaroons, mini cheesecakes, etc. Pretty nice.   We used the rest of the afternoon to work off our brunch!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was good---bacon and smokey. Pork chop was overcooked and a bit dry. Tasted like hickory. Compressed melon dish fell flat---wilted arugula served no purpose on the dish. Not sure that the basalmic added anything to the dish either. Dessert was okay. Tiramisu had very thin pieces of ladyfingers with little coffee flavor. Mostly a bowl of mascarpone cheese that was lacking sweetness. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Food was good, not great. Bernaise for steak came out 5 minutes after steak arrived. Waitress never came by to check on us after someone else dropped off the food. For the beauty of the property, this came up short once again.  Went again after hearing of the new chef hoping things were better than my meal there a year ago. Not much improvement. At the end of the day my largest complaint of this restaurant is the service. It is extremely slow, and seemingly spread too thin and poorly trained. That has been consistent for the last few years. The new chef did ok, not great."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here a couple times during our stay at the Phoenician.  The terrace seating is where it's at!  This place has a beautiful view of the Phoenician grounds with the desert hills in the background.  With a hot cup of coffee and a complimentary hotel copy of the WSJ, it's pretty much the perfect way to start your day.  ...Maybe that's how they justify charging $17-25 for breakfast, plus an additional $6 - yes SIX DOLLARS - for a regular cup of joe!  Hear that?  That's the sound of one star swooshing away!   Sure, the food here is solid (try the Carnitas Huevos Rancheros - YUM), but after two days of this we just got tired of dropping $75 on breakfast.  The other star is lost due to service.  Both mornings we waited a good 10 min for anyone to take a drink order, and another 10 min before we actually received our overpriced cups of coffee.  I don't care if you're a diner or a 4-star hotel, 20 min is too long to wait for a freaking cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"She's as beautiful and as sweet as her mom!  Except for the dark hair and the seemingly endless assertive and passionate opinions about everything, she is just like her mom - lovely, intelligent, and compassionate.  This was a belated Happy Birthday lunch for my beloved daughter. We weren't able to connect due to the fact that she worked during her actual birthday, and we seemingly have these endless conflicts in schedule.  We were finally able to arrive at an agreed upon time and location, which is why we were here on this particular day.   Additionally, I also wanted to take her this particular venue because in times past, this was one of the regular spots we chose for our Father / Daughter dinner dates when Mary Elaine's was still at the Phoenician.  This time was especially significant for me because in a few days, I will be meeting with the man in her life who will be asking for my blessing and permission to marry her.   Therefore, these Father / Daughter times will be even few and far between as she progresses towards a new chapter in her life.  I still remember, as if it was yesterday, how impossibly difficult her entry to this world was. She was considerably premature, and she had a underdeveloped heart that had a hole and was not yet fully formed. And to top it all off, she also had a brain hemorrhage.   She spent the first few months of her life in the Neo-Natal facility @ St. Joseph's Hospital. When she was released to us, we were instructed to force feed her every hour because she could not naturally ingest milk.   If we failed, she would die. And because of her myriad of issues, the doctors were not optimistic about her physical success. It was one of many dark days earlier in our married life.  And here she is now, dining with her dad on the terrace of this beautiful restaurant. Not a single issue or care in her life, about to marry a good man.  How times had changed!  What hasn't changed is the excellent dining experience that one can expect from this establishment. I have eaten here at IL Terrazzo on various occasions and have never been disappointed.   I've been here for Lunch, Dinner, and even the Sunday Brunch; and their food and service have always been impeccable. Since the weather was so beautiful, we opted for terrace seating.  Our server, Angela, was cordially professional. Being very cognizant of not interrupting our conversations, and always looked for the proper opening as to when to interject any proffering of service.  My daughter ordered the Phoenician Club with the Market soup. And I ordered the Faroe Island Salmon.  Both our dishes were very well prepared. Just simply delightful in their flavor and presentation. The wait staff that supported Angela were also very attentive, and never missed a bit regarding our refills.  We stayed longer than we had anticipated because we were enjoying each other's company so much, and we didn't experience a downturn of service in spite of our prolonged stay.  And as we were leaving, the staff graciously thanked us for our visit.   Just a marvelous experience from a top-rated establishment, which contributed to making her Birthday lunch an auspicious occasion."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try since It was participating in restaurant week. When you first come into the Phoenician there is a guard to Greet you. He's great at telling you where to go and is extremely friendly. When we went in to find the restaurant we had some difficulty at first. So my suggestion is definitely do valet parking to make your life easier. All the wait staff were welcoming and the decor was just elegant as well as modern.  Now the food...was amazing! I decided to go with the mussels which is a starter. It was literally a bottomless bowl of them in a delicious bouillabaes sauce. I had to share because I was filling up. The bread was nice and fresh. There were 3 different types as well as an amazing pesto oil. My main dish was the carbonara pasta. It had a fresh egg on top and as soon as I touched it, it went all over it. Made it super fresh and delicious!   Finally we decided to share one dessert. We were celebrating our anniversary so they brought me a complimentary dessert as well as a dessert wine. They were amazing. Everything was perfect. Honestly if you want something special, this is the place to go. Great Food, Great Service and nice and peaceful."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast at this restaurant and had such a wonderful experience. I had the buffet which had lots of options. The food was freshly prepared and tasted good. The waiter was a gentleman named Kenny, he was very prompt, and our coffee, juice and water was always refreshed.  I would recommend this place to others and would definitely go back. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The presentation and taste of the food was excellent. The price is not cheap, but I feel you get your money's worth with the whole experience."}
{"text":"Service was excellent however the dining hall is not a welcoming  environment. It's like a rubber duck banquet hall... Also food quality was sub par. Food was salty and the chicken dish I ordered was stringy and disappointing for the high the high price they charge. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Whenever my aunt comes to town, she specifically stays at the Phoenician just to come here for breakfast/brunch. Service is great, and servers are SO attentive. They even have some guy with a giant falcon to scare away the little birds outside."}
{"text":"I have dined at this fine establishment multiple times. And i have to say, it is quite a fantastic place. The reasoning behind this isn't based solely on the food (which is quite excellent), the setting (tucked close to Camelback Mountain), or the ambiance (cool, quiet, and up class). No. It has a lot to do with the remarkable service. They treat you well without being fake or smug. They seek to provide an overall excellent dining experience. And they bend over backwards to ensure your food is crafted the way you like. I love Il Terrazzo, and you will too."}
{"text":"(I am a Phoenician employee working in the pastry shop; I took my mom here for her birthday.)  Claudia was a gracious and kind host and our main server, Zoey, was very sweet. The other servers (Arturo, Israel, Max) were awesome as well. The General Manager, Mike Lee was more than accommodating.  I had talked to Chef de Partie Dallas the night before and he said he would do something nice for us. The food he made us was a lovely surprise. Everything was delicious and was easily the best food both me and my mom have ever had. I was able to make my mom a special dessert thanks to Chef Roy in the pastry shop.  At the end of our meal, I asked for the check and was told not worry and that everything had been taken care of. My jaw just about dropped to the table. My mother and I were completely floored by the incredible service, food, and generosity of the entire staff. It was a truly wonderful and unforgettable experience. If this is how awesome Phoenician employees are treated, then Phoenician guests must be treated tenfold.    Thank you to everyone, both named and unnamed.   Andromeda"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Karin was super. We went in a huge group and they made space for us. My veal ravioli was nice and I loved the creme brule. They have some cool belinis also."}
{"text":"I'm very conflicted. For those with food allergies, this was a fantastic experience. Attentive and entirely helpful to find a dinner and even a dessert for my wife who can't have gluten, dairy, or eggs. But, for the price and setting, the food was completely sub-par. They ruined a great sea bass and the filet was like eating at a conference. So, although we really want to like it, we won't be back. Thanks to Chris our server though. He was great."}
{"text":"Before you read any further into this review, it is important to note a couple of things: Firstly, I am only reviewing their Sunday brunch. Secondly, I have been coming to the Phoenician for Sunday brunches since before I can remember, so I have a massive frame of reference here--and it admittedly skews my review.   The brunch is delicious. Truly wonderful small bites and breakfast items that both entice the palate and satisfy it. After having not been to a brunch here in a couple years, it was amazing to see the transformation that has occurred--the modernization both in food and decor. Some things that I tried, like the cured pork slab and the seared tuna really made me feel as though they had stepped up their game. Others, like the lamb shepherds pie with polenta wrote a check that my taste buds couldn't quite cash. The staples, like the prime rib, were better than you can get at most places.  But I have to admit, I am not able to give that final fifth star because of my own prejudice. Going to the Phoenician is tied up with so much nostalgia for me. We used to go every Mother's Day, when they had a live band, and we would eat at OUR table--the same table every year--and dance on their dance floor. The buffet was HUGE then, taking up 3 full rooms and the patio for grilled items, and desserts were set up in the bar. I remember as they filled all the adults glasses with mimosas, they brought me my own tiny little bottle of Martinelli's and made me my own mimosa so that I could celebrate with the adults. Over the years, they took out the dance floor, and then the band went away. The food was still plentiful, but the quality deteriorated, and the family decided not to go back for a while.   It had been a while, and when I heard that we were going to celebrate my uncle's 90th birthday there, I was ecstatic to see what it had become. Walking in the door, I was immediately deflated. The arrangement was significantly smaller, fitting into only 2 rooms and no outdoor grill. The room that used to hold OUR table, now was one of the rooms used for food items, and I was sad.   *Sigh*  Things change, and consciously I know that. But I wish they hadn't. I really, really wish they hadn't. In all fairness, though, it is still one of the best brunches in Metro Phoenix, and I would still highly recommend it. Further, I hope that my family decides to make this place something that we do again. I hope that we can make new memories for the next generation of this family that are as personal to them as my memories of the Phoenician are to me."}
{"text":"Il Terrazzo is located within the Phoenician.  We had a continental breakfast here on Saturday morning before our hike up Camelback and had brunch/lunch here on Sunday so we could watch football.   Saturday morning was fine, the continental breakfast is quite pricey ($17 per person) but luckily we had two coupons so we got it for free.  The breakfast has the normal oatmeal, cereal, fruit, muffins sort of thing.  Sunday morning was much better because we ate at in the bar area.  Sunday they have bottomless mimosas included in the price of the breakfast, which was great since it was our last day and we were leaving in the afternoon.  We were able to use our voucher value towards the price of lunch instead of having the same breakfast as the day before.  I had a turkey club on foccatia bread and the BF had a cheeseburger.  Both came with fries and both were quite good.  The service was fantastic.    All in all, the only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 was because their hostess is quite unpleasant.  Not only that, I'm highly confused as to why this seating process takes so long when there are tons of open tables in the dining room and most people are going for the buffet area.    Tip: Sit in the bar area, you get the same menu, same prices and better/friendlier service without the wait :)"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the famed Phoenician Resort.  I have to admit that it's even nicer than The Arizona Biltmore Resort, although the Biltmore's dark concrete gives it a sort of old-world charm.  The light stucco of the Phoenician, along with the amazing pool and lush greenery, give it a tropical feel that is somewhat similar to the top Vegas resorts.  After our complementary valet parking, we made our way to Il Terrazzo, the Italian restaurant on the first floor.  It's classical and elegant inside the restaurant with a stunning view, especially if you sit outside on the terrace.  We opted to sit inside because it was still quite warm at night, and most of patrons outside were dressed more casually than us.  The restaurant had a very nice wine list, including many glasses and half bottles.  They served 4 different types of bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  All were delicious.  My wife especially liked the olive bread, which was lost on me because I dislike olives.  Unfortunately, the bread may have been the high point of the meal for me.  Our arugula salad had an interesting mix of blueberries, peaches, hazelnuts, and shaved romano cheese in it.  Against all those sweet elements, the vinagrette dressing was too sweet and there was too much of it.  There was also too much cheese.  (Note: It was nice of them to split the salad into two portions for us.)  I ordered the braised short ribs with mascarpone polenta.  The meat was very tender, and both elements were tasty, but it was a very rich meal.  It needed some sort of fresh element or vegetable, and I should have only eaten half of the portion.  Unfortunately, I have the clean-your-plate mentality of a puppy.  My wife's scallops were fantastic and  perfectly prepared.  The gnocchi that came with the scallops were not the creamiest or fluffiest gnocchi that I've ever tasted, but they were seared on one side, which gave them a nice flavor and texture change.  Since they knew it was our anniversary, they served us a complementary plate of cookies and decorative chocolate, along with 2 glasses of sparkling blush wine.  It was a very sweet gesture, but the cookies were mediocre, and I was looking forward to ordering an elaborate dessert from a fine restaurant.  In summary, Il Terrazzo serves beautiful plate presentations, befitting this beautiful restaurant in a beautiful resort.  The service was outstanding.  The meals were not grossly overpriced, but I expected better food at that price tag."}
{"text":"Honestly the best ny strip I have had in years    resturants decor outdated but tastey food"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant!  We stayed at the Phoenician for the weekend and dined at  il Terazzo twice.  Dinner was fabulous!  Chris our waiter, was the best.  Great service, wonderful food. The meal started with warm olives and 3 types of bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Entrees were delicious.  Dessert was fabulous.  Highly recommend the crème brulee..  We also went to Sunday Brunch.  By far the best deal in the valley for Sunday Brunch! Price was reasonable and the food was delightful.  Fresh berries and melons were perfect.  Homemade pastries were amazing. Can't list the full line of foods.  Salads, meats, cheeses, shrimp, ahi tuna, lamb, rabbit, pork ribs, desserts...the list could go on and on. Everything was \"top of the line\"  Service was the best we have had in any 5 star restaurant.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent summer 3 course prix fixe meal for only $29 or pair each course w/ wine for only $10 more! The short rib was very tender & the risotto was simply amazing, just the right texture and great flavor. Service was impeccable just like you would expect from the lovely Phoenician Resort. Sometimes it pays to be a local especially during the summer months. A+"}
{"text":"Aside from the service the breakfast wasn't much. For $17 I got McDonald's eggs, microwaved bacon and cold toast. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch! So many options, both breakfast and lunch options. All of the food was superb. They had everything from an omelette station to sushi to lox to lucky charms. There was a nice array of small bites. The restaurant itself was well lit with natural light and the staff was accommodating. We had a large party and they let us pay individually without hesitation."}
{"text":"Jared and I went on a date to Il Terrazzo for dinner on Friday night.  We had a gift card valid for dinner for two, and we were waiting for the perfect night to use it.  Friday night was just cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio at Il Terrazzo, and we did just that...  Service was spot on, ambiance was great, and food did not disappoint either.  I forgot how much I am a fan of the Phoenician's homemade bread until our basket came... pair that with the dirty martini I ordered and I was one happy camper!  But of course we didn't stop there.  I had a Caesar Salad and J went with the Caprese Salad to start.  He ordered Veal Ravioli for the next course and of course I had to try it... it was creamy and heavy but in a good way.  We definitely could've stopped there but too late - our entrees were on their way!  J went with the Kobe Flat Iron and I had the Scallops.  Way way way too much food, but we did take home leftovers.  We passed on dessert but still left with full bellies.  Il Terrazzo is on the pricey side.  As a matter of fact, our gift card covered everything but my drink, and my one martini was $19.77 before tip!  Pretty insane, right?  I'm not sure we'd rush back on our own dime, but we'll be there in a heartbeat if someone else foots the bill!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Yep, it's expensive. You want to show off for a date, celebrate an important family or friend event, it would be worth every penny. The quality and atmosphere may be the absolute best buffet in the valley."}
{"text":"For August breakfast club we headed on over for Sunday Brunch at IL Terrazzo, and let me tell you, this brunch is decadent!   It was an Italian Market Brunch, just a beautiful spread of lovely dishes.  I have been searching all over the valley for the perfect eggs benedicts and I found them here at IL Terrazzo, the 64° farm egg benedict is creamy, perfectly cooked and just perfect! It's the way an egg should always be done. This was perfection!  There is a lot of items to choose from, I'm sure every picky eater could walk away happy. I also tried the Arizona tomatoes, tuna tartar, delish shrimp, shaved prosciutto, handmade mozzarella, other cheeses and meats with breads and a few other items. The brunch spread is extremely nice, and perfectly portioned, most everything is in small single servings. Oh and the desserts, oh my they too were heavenly!  This was a great Sunday Brunch and I do look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Phoenician and had the opportunity to dine at Il Terrrazzo for breakfast.  It would have been a lovely experience if it was not for the fact that the host was overly pretentious and the lady at the bar wasn't able to handle more than 4 customers at a time.   It's unfortunate that a beautiful property like the Phoenician doesn't prioritize employing more competent hospitable people."}
{"text":"Il Terrazzo is pretty good but its definitely a hotel restaurant  at a price point equivalent to the hotel its in.  I'd only go back if I were staying at the hotel again."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch was fantastic.  Special thanks to the Brian Pierce and the team there for researching food allergy information for us and making the experience easy, relaxing, and delicious!  Very happy, three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Even when they're busy there is good service which is what you get when you eat at a five diamond property with a four star star restaurant. They change their menu enough to keep a frequent guest interested. I truly think the mussels and beef tenderloin are absolutely a must have for dinner! Brian, one of the managers, will always take great care of you if you have any concerns or needs. It's definitely a place worth trying, so try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Party of 7 had brunch here over the weekend, and thought it was excellent for the money.  You can choose between 3 courses for $35, extra $10 to add the buffet, or $25 for buffet only.  The former two include unlimited champagne! There are plenty of choices if you opt for the 3 course: I started with the prosciutto & melon;  the standard cantaloupe was replaced with a large, thick slice of watermelon that had been soaked in a sort of balsamic sherry.  The color was so deep and beautiful it looked more like ahi tuna than fruit.  It was peppered with spicy arugula and tangy goat cheese, and I really enjoyed it.  Next up, the eggs benedict, an excellent execution of the standard, with extra-crispy sourdough muffins and well-balanced hollandaise.  I nibbled off a few of the other plates: the apple-wood smoked bacon was simply irresistible, ahi nicoise farro salad was unique & fresh, made to order omelet was simple perfection, and the butternut squash panzanella was delicious.  Others really enjoyed their spaghetti with veal meatballs and two people who got the huevos rancheros said it was some of the best they'd had.  The final course was a large tower of assorted pastries & cookies.  These really didn't wow me very much at all, but I seemed to be in the minority as others happily indulged.   Overall a superb brunch in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday brunch spread with a ton of different options that can be enjoyed on the big outdoor terrace with a nice view overlooking the resort--definitely don't miss this if you're spending the weekend here.  Most things are bite sized so you can try everything and/or get seconds (or thirds...); my favorites were the shrimp cocktail, tuna, and the lamb and polenta.  They are not strict about the dress code so you can even show up in your bathrobe:)"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because I enjoyed the appetizers (beet and mozzarella salad) and the arugula salad.   But I paid $48 for the worst steak of my life.  I ordered the ribeye and it was the WORST cut of meat i ever had.  I could have made better steak at home for much less $.   It was clearly a bad cut of meat bc it was so chewy i could barely eat it.  It was overseasoned with salt - probably because the meat itself had no taste.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Sunday brunch!  All-you-can eat buffet for $25/person, including bottomless mimosas.  All of the food was fresh and delicious -- not what you expect from a typical buffet in that price range.  The outdoor tables are comfortable and relaxing and the resort atmosphere around the hotel makes for a fun experience.  Just don't try to hang out at the pool after -- you'll be asked to leave if you aren't staying at the hotel!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, he had recommendations and was right there. Unfortunately, the food wasn't great, at least for the price. Had a bottle of wine and a nice evening on the patio, but if I had to do it again we would just do appetizers."}
{"text":"Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinnner..... This elegant and beautiful restaurant is top notch in service and food."}
{"text":"Most amazing Christmas Brunch! The only other comparison is to the Four Seasons Resort in Maui. The service was incredible.  Steve took very good care of us.  The meats were tender and flavorful, the fish superb, cheeses delicious and pastries succulent. The mimosas kept coming and the latte was just right. We loved seeing all the other guests in their finest clothes. It was just great entertainment and delicious food."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and always have a really nice time. This time the winner was the bread and pesto!! So good I wound up ordering pasta with the pesto they served with the bread. Good wine selection. Creme Brûlée was delicious!! Servers were very good!"}
{"text":"Very good buffet selection. Half cracked crab claws that I dipped in the lobster bisque was my favorite along with mushroom risotto, lamb chops & eggs over medium (my attempt for a Filipino-style breakfast). Their blueberry bread pudding was soft and creamy and the Crete brûlée topped with chocolate-espresso mini malt balls (special secret combination by the Filipino chef behind the meat section, helps to speak Tagalog to him) topped off my gluttonous eating adventure... Oh, don't forget to try the Chai Tea Oatmeal, for a semi-healthy indulgence during 5 trips to the buffet table, or was it 6 trips? I might need to try and replicate that one at home."}
{"text":"My friend and I split courses here for lunch and it was way more than enough food. Our waitress was such a lovely person! Amazing service for sure (Bernadette! Loved her).   We split: a glass of wine (recommendation by Bernadette, stellar); the arugula and endive salad (great esp for hot weather); and the daily risotto, which was super good (english peas, ham, marscapone, pecorino romano), and then, because Susie couldn't resist, topped it off with a creme brulee.   Sitting on the patio with a fan, views over the pools, relaxing on a lazy Monday was lovely."}
{"text":"Rating based on breakfast only.  We ate here for breakfast 4 out of 5 days recently.  Very enjoyable setting, great service, and really delicious and inventive breakfast selections.  If you are staying at the Phoenician, don't miss having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner~ Excellent service!  It was my 29th birthday and we decided to celebrate at a highly recommended place by my relatives. We arrived a little later than planned due to parking, but it wasn't any worse than any other hotel restaurants. We were greeted by a professional host who wished me a happy birthday and sat us in a rather large table for the two of us.  The server was extremely polite and gave us ample time to look over the menu as this was our first visit. Not entirely sure if we just looked like regulars, but no recommendations were given initially. We ordered our meals; started with the Tuna (excellent) appetizer, she ordered the Salmon and I ordered the American Kobe Flat Iron. The meals were perfectly spread out in terms of when it came, and the portions were excellent. You must try the smash potatoes! If you are a bacon fan like I am, you will love it! The salmon was cooked perfectly but the American Kobe was just a tad bit salty ~ but cooked perfectly the way I ordered it.  After our meal the waiter brought us a cookie sampler and some excellent wine as a complimentary gift. The wine was very smooth and complimented the cookies very well; there were 4 different kinds, each delectable as the previous.  The atmosphere is of a high-end restaurant where you can pretty much guess that the dishes are at least $30 each, and the choice of dark finishes on the furniture along with the light tablecloths well exemplifies the high-end feel. The only reason why I give this a 4 star is due to the seating; they tried to sit us in a nice area away from the crowd, but it was too close to the door where people were walking in and out constantly throughout our meal~ kudos for trying though.  All in all, this is an excellent restaurant and I would highly recommend it as the food is as good as the service~ I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! - Cheers"}
{"text":"We had a $180 gift certificate to burn at the Phoenician, and our first choice was to spend it at J&G's steakhouse, but they don't honor them. So....2nd choice was Il Terrazzo.   Beatiful environment, and that's about the only positive thing I'll say about this place. We started with the Calamari for an appetizer, and a couple of drinks. We finally had these after 30 minutes of waiting.  The Calamari tasted like it came from a Jack in the Box drive thru. No joke! And, the sauce that came with it tasted like it came from a Reser's container.  We went with the Caesar salad next. Very plain, just lettuce, dressing and croutons.   For dinner we had a pasta dish with spinach and mushrooms, and we requested chicken to be added. We had been at our table about 2 hours by the time this arrived, and only had 2 drinks (we would have been about 6-8 deep if there was ANY service). And.....after all of that waiting.....our dinner arrives only to discover that it has no flavor at all.   We try to get our check, and this took an additional 30 minutes, and they were unable to figure out how to use their own gift cards.   Boo-urns on Terrazzo, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Today, I went to brunch with my sister and mother. Brunch was simply delightful. The lamb chops were tender and fell right off the bone, accompanied by a little mint jelly per the suggestion of the chef. The desserts were plentiful, artistic, and delicious. The chef that was at the station with meat and sushi was sooo helpful and friendly! We actually talked about how delightful and proud of his food, at the table. Our server, Edgar, let us take our time and tended to all of our needs. The food was great and service was too. Some of the many reasons we dine here for brunch."}
{"text":"I do not even know where to start. As we are seated we had to clean our own chairs off of all sorts of crumbs and food from the previous diners. The hostess just stood there as we are cleaning our own chairs. The food was not very good. Cold eggs. We ordered pancakes. Had to ask 3 separate people. Finally received the pancakes after an hour. Water was hardly filled. But they were sure to throw the bill down on the table  25 mins after we got there. I was walking back to my seat from buffet and one of the serves pushed past me to get by. When the proper etiquette would be to yield to the paying customer to get back to their seat. It really was a bad experience. We have been here several times over the years and each time it gets worse. We will not be giving it another chance"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quiet lunch (exactly what we did when we first arrived) although, it was almost....too quiet. We returned the next day for the breakfast buffet and felt it was over priced. Though our toddler ate free, the bill was almost $70 for two of us....a lot for breakfast with very standard fare....Venture off site (if you can!) to Daily Dose or Arcadia Farms for breakfast nearby...."}
{"text":"My husband I stayed at the Phoenician for my birthday and the hotel is overall beyond exceptional . I am really disappointed I didn't give J&G a chance (it took 30 minutes just to greet us to order a drink and terrazzo was our second choice.)Il Terrazzos setting is exquisitely romantic , the wine list is better than J&G. I started out with the Potato Chowder , the presentation was fun and the soup was really good. My husband had a caesar, the dressing had the perfect lemon touch, I liked it, but my husband thought it was too salty. We both ordered filets and like they say don't order steak at an Italian Restaurant ;not true, but in this case it was one of the worse steaks I've had. I ordered mine medium and my husband medium rare. The steaks didn't come out as requested, I nibbled on mine but it was too dry to finish and my husband returned his because it was well done. When he cut into the replacement steak there was no jus at all, both of are steaks so dry it wasn't easy to cut through , you just wanted a pound of sauce for moisture. Disappointing for a 42.00 steak and 150.00 check for a disappointing meal. the waiter was really great and made our experience pleasant and we tipped well even though the food was horrible. I think he felt bad and he sent complementary  goat cheese cake and a chocolate torte wine champagne to our room. It was a great way to end the night .. I don't think I will revisit the restaurant, but I do hope they get take a hint and improve the quality."}
{"text":"The full buffet is absolutely wonderful, the service is nothing short of perfect and the atmosphere is relaxed and peaceful. The smoked salmon is beautiful, the omelet bar is nothing short of impressive, they served the perfectly portion-sized egg white burritos served with red pepper cream cheese and pomegranate pico de gallo, roasted vegetables (brussel sprouts, asparagus, golden beets, eggplant and more), charcuterie, rosemary potatoes, french toast with amazing maple syrup, surprisingly good scrambled eggs & the most amazing parfait served in a martini glass that had the creamiest and most flavorful yogurt I did not anticipate loving as much as I did.  All in all, I would highly recommend for breakfast of you are staying at the Phoenician."}
