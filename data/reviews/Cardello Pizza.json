{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt at airport and ordered from Cardello pizza based off hotel staff recommendations. The entire order was done online through eat 24.com. I even gave them a tip, but when the driver came to deliver he had the wrong order, but yet he knew my order. I ask him to go back and get the right order while I wait - he made a fuss and said \"no\" basically. Even the restaurant was confused as to what was going on....  An hour later they finally give me a refund, for delivery just don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews were spot on. We ordered based on the reviews and the pizza didn't disappoint. The crust is A#1-perfect texture and taste with a balance of chewy + light. We also ordered the spinach feta pizza which was delish. Fast delivery + reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmazing pies! I stayed at the Hyatt airport hotel and was delighted to have food delivered tonight very quickly by courteous staff."}
{"text":"I'm truck driver, got delivery to this town, was pretty late around midnight, found this place and did order pizza (veggie plus chicken )... I got it in 20min and man was amazing pizza, so delicious at that late night... Great pizza, well done guys.... I wish I could stop by their place but was with big semi so no way((.... Thank you for the pizza"}
{"text":"I was working in the area and came across Cardello pizza. I ordered the Chicago style and it was awesome. The sauce complimented the cheese with a true Chicago crust. Not a eat in restaurant but pick up and delivery. Good price for the quality. Nice people. I went back. No regrets"}
{"text":"Great food! Pizza, peperoni rolls and spinach feta rolls. Best place in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area.  Lived in the area for two years and have been searching for a good local pizza shop.  Look forward to trying everything they offer."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh got a lot of pizza joints but this one is the best so far. yes it is just a Little run down corner what used to be a deli but I happy to say I glad their in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes alright, but honestly it takes work to screw up pizza. Nothing special and too expensive for how long you wait. Paid online and they tried to get me to pay again when I picked it up in the store, and they were rude to us. Don't waste your time with this pizza place when there are better tasting and cheaper options in moon."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza from here since they opened and up until about a month ago food was fine for a local pizzeria. To be honest, there are few places on Moon worth going out of your way to order.  What I do want the other patrons to be aware of is poor and rude service, along with long delivery times.  The owner of Cardello (Smiley) and the manager (Mandy) put out coupons and restaurant.com coupons and then do not honor them.  We spent over $50 dollars in coupons and because they could not learn how to use technology and track these coupons, they simply left the customer with no recourse.  Of note, the only thing worth ordering is the pizza as the wings and sandwiches are all greasy and do not taste fresh.  In general, it's better to order from Vocelli or similar that has decent food and respects their customer base."}
{"text":"I have honestly never had their pizza; but, I've ordered almost every salad on their menu. Overall, they are all yummy - try the Greek dressing on anything! But, it is extremely inconsistent- you can never expect the same exact quantity or quality out of each order. Sometimes the pitas a burnt on the gyro salad, sometimes you only get a few buffalo chips on the buffalo chicken salad, sometimes you get under seasoned chicken on the chicken salad, etc..  I really want to give more stars because when it is good, man, oh man, it is GOOD. But when it's bad or not as expected, it is such a let down.  TIP: Coming from someone who LOVES trying wedding soup, everywhere I go - do NOT order their wedding soup. It tastes old, congealed and almost canned, like a progresso version that's been heated - not worth (little over) 4$."}
{"text":"Whoever owns this establishment, should take their pizza recipe, crumble it up in a ball and toss it in the garbage and start over. This is the worst pizza in Pittsburgh, bar none! It makes Pizza Hut taste like world-class pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza!!! It's what's for lunch!  We had this delicious pizza and a salad for lunch today at my office and I'm so happy to know that it's close by! I had the veggie pizza and a salad. The vegetables on the pizza were fresh and complimented the perfect ratio of sauce and cheese. (I'm not a fan of drowning my toppings on sauce and cheese). The crust was thin but not floppy. The salad was nice and green, topped with tomatoes,cucumbers and a few too many red onion rings but I'm just not a fan of onion in my salad. I've bookmarked this for future orders."}
{"text":"I was at a Pittsburgh Airport hotel for four nights. I used the Yelp 24 food ordering application on my phone for three dinners. The menu is quite extensive but I stuck with pizza and salad -- pizza twice as a meal with side salad and one night a salad as a meal. The pizza was quite good (they include ranch dipping sauce for the crust); the salads just so-so. How often does one eat at the same place three straight nights? That speaks for the restaurant. The time from ordering to eating in my hotel room was 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I pulled up to this little pizza shop with great doubts because it looks a bit rundown on the exterior. There are no seats inside, but a few outdoor benches in front of the shop. They also sell ice cream, drinks and prepackaged desserts inside. Very friendly service and they prepared my order in less than 15 minutes.   I ordered my usual pizza filled with mushrooms and chicken, along with an order of fries and honey BBQ wings. The cashier was very accommodating to my picky demands. I wasn't very impressed by their wings, which were a bit over fried and scrawny. The honey BBQ sauce was pretty good though. Fries were crispy and not too greasy or salty (Wohoo!). The pizza was near perfection--good sauce, good amount of toppings and not greasy or soggy. The side of garlic sauce was such a perfect addition for the thick pizza crust.   Overall, this little dinky pizza shop is my favorite so far in the Coraopolis/Moon area for its fast and efficient service and quality food. I would really like to try their specialty pizza next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best pizza around!  I usually get pepperoni pizza and it hasn't let me down yet. It comes with ranch sauce on the side which I am convinced is made there because it tastes amazing not not like ranch out of the bottle. The honey bbq wings are so awesome too. They are crispy and delicious. Spot on."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Cardello for about a year and half, and I can safely say that this is my favorite pizza place in the area.  The food is always hot and the ingredients fresh.  The pizza is DELICIOUS; the delivery people are courteous and always get my food to me earlier than expected. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Sicilian pizza and it was dry, bland and had almost no sauce. I have a bunch left over and don't want to eat it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza had very little chicken on it but lots of potatoes. Kind of a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Are you serious ?!? I'm livid ! We all ordered at 10 the guy said 40-45 mins then after an hour we were all starving and called to get eta....just rang and rang and rang after 10 more mins we called.... got nothing.....called again... Everyone went back to their rooms and hotels . At 11:25 the guy showed up... I can't eat all that.... we tried to cancel. ... I said sorry everyone left we tried to cancel after an hour and 15 mins ... the guy looked pissed at me then stormed off........not my fault ..."}
{"text":"Ordered the deep dish Chicago and am extremely satisfied. Delivery time was fine, pizza is great. Great crust and very unique sauce. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 12:00PM on a Sunday. It was a big order, 4 pizzas, 4 chicken wraps and 20 drinks. Delivery was spot on at 45 minutes. Most importantly the food was GREAT!! The buffalo chicken wrap was flavorful and had a nice kick. The meat lover pizza has lots of toppings, no shortage, you get what you pay for. Great work, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Pizza is always lovely. I usually order a pepperoni pizza or ham and pineapple. Always delivered hot! No complaints great pizza and amazing service"}
{"text":"I asked them to write a haiku about pizza on the delivery box and they wrote one. Also the crust is incredible. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to buy at first for some reason.  But finally did today and  it was pretty good.  I got the Large 1 topping special delivered to my job for me and a coworker.  Cheese was nice and fresh, dough was light and flavorful but the MVP was the ranch dip they give you with it.  I have been hooked on Franks Pizz and Chicken and Genoas Ranch for years but now Cardellos takes the cake!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel nearby for a night and ordered delivery. Their pizza is delicious!!!! Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely order here again."}
{"text":"Delivery was 25 mins late, Salad was made wrong with old dried up gyro meat, the wings had the wrong sauce. Will never order here again."}
{"text":"They have he best weggie ever !!!! They are the best pizza place in Moon. Super fast and always so nice. The young girl that runs the counter is always smiling. I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Am having a tough time with this review.  The order I received had such potential.....only problem is, I didn't receive the order that I ordered.  I ordered the sampler basket (which came and was good) and also the broccoli and cheese pizza which I have never had but was very intrigued by the description.  Problem is, I still haven't had a broccoli and cheese pizza.  A buffalo chicken pizza arrived with my order, looked great but was loaded with onion and I detest onions.  So I did enjoy the sampler basket but called the place about my wrong order.  The friendly girl that answered the phone explained that yes, wrong deliveries get made frequently but they would get the correct pizza out to me.  But by then I would no longer need the pizza as the sampler basket had satisfied my hunger so I asked if she could refund just the pizza portion of the order.  She said yes but I would need to speak with a manager to process.  Friendly manager came on the phone, I explained my situation, he also said yes, frequent wrong deliveries are made (seems like something they should address) and he could get the right pizza out to me quickly or refund the pizza.  I asked for the refund and he said no problem, he would process.  Well......a couple of bank statements later and the refund never hit my account.  Such potential here but unfortunately, Cardello fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"We just had the best Chicago deep dish pizza we've ever had. The Greek Salad was also great. We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"The spaghetti was bland and the cinnamon knots were terrible. I requested delivery and the delivery person was nice. However, he tried to get me to take a Mountain Dew instead of the root beer I ordered. I will never try this place again. Going to nurse a stomach ache and hunger for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"This place is small with a huge taste. So when you visit them do not judge the place. The food will put a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Much better than expected.  Best pie I have had in years. I am eating this for the next two days . Best $16 spent in a long time.  Delivery took 25 minutes - quoted 30. Granted was a 2:45 call - but so what   Would recommend - especially if you are from Indy and don't know what a pizza is."}
{"text":"Order a steak hoagie lunch special. There was a few very thin slices of steak that I wouldn't know were there if I didn't look, old looking lettuce and burnt cheese. The only thing that was good was the side of ranch I ordered."}
{"text":"Quick delivery, but terrible food. I should've ordered one of their pizzas, but then again, you'd think that if half of their menu was Mediterranean, it might be at least half way decent.   Wrong! I ordered the chicken gyro platter and hot wings. The pita from the gyro platter was heavy and tasted like a halfway baked fried bread while the chicken looked boiled with herbs and then lightly toasted in an oven. The tzatziki sauce was probably the only thing that saved the entire sandwich. Lastly, the wings were soggy and lightly seasoned with hot sauce.   Don't waste your money and go any place but here. Advice to management, stick to your pizzas!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon cheese burger. The burger was not fresh tasting and the bacon on the burger was bacon bites."}
{"text":"We ordered the Sicilian Pizza. It was very good with lots of toppings. It was delivered to our hotel room. Only issue they did not bring plates and napkins as requested."}
{"text":"Stayed at the airport in Pittsburgh, used my Yelp to find a good pizza delivery place. Ordering was easy, they said it would take 40 mins it arrived to our room in 25! And what a treat it was, wonderful crust, cheese was so flavorful, only downside was with really good pizza comes grease, the bottom of the box was pretty wet when we finished this mouth watering delight!"}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone twice in one week, and both were delicious! I just had a sausage and pepperoni one, and it was oozing with sauce and cheese, which is just the way I like it! Seems like their ranch dressing is homemade as well. I'll be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in moon township. The Chicago style is our absolute favorite and absolutely perfect. You will not find a chocago style that compares to theirs anywhere near herw. Their delivery is fast and the food is always HOT...as if I took it out of my own oven."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight and needed delivery. Ordered through Yelp, it was very quick & easy! Driver got here very quickly and we had ordered the Chicago Deep Dish and buffalo wings. Amazing! We're so happy with the service and quality. Definitely will order again :)"}
{"text":"This is a review on the restaurant's delivery and service. Called for delivery and the guy didn't even quote me an ETA. I just thought to myself that it couldn't have been a long time - it doesn't take that long to make a pizza at 1am in the morning on a Thursday night. 40 minutes passed by. I called the restaurant to check on ETA. Told the guy that I called an hour ago for delivery. I can't believe the guy who answered the phone told me that I called at 12:45 and it's now 1:20. It hasn't been an hour. How rude is that?! This was absolutely the most horrible service I've ever had! Never eating here again."}
