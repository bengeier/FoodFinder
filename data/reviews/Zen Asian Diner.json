{"text":"I ordered the sweet potato roll and the chicken tempura. I'm not sure if this was just a poor choice for a meal or if the food in general is bad, but I had three bites of each, sat staring at the poor choice of a meal I had made, and threw away the rest.  The chicken tempura was something you would order from in Hienz field. Because this is supposed to be a Chinese restaurant I mean that in the worst way possible. The chicken tempura literally came with a side of onion rings and fried potato chips. by potato chips I mean literal slices of potato that were fried in \"tempura\".   Suffice to say, I would not recommend ordering the food here. There's a ton of chinese restaurants in the area. Don't risk the chance of having a bad meal."}
{"text":"Zen is our go to place for local sushi and Chinese food. Extremely fast and all around awesome. Everyone is very nice and kind.   The online ordering is very good as well. Pickup times from them are about 10 minutes, so if you need a fast and healthy bite this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Everything was beyond awful!  This place has really been going downhill.  The rangoons were not even cooked, the general tso's looked and tasted like it was days old with NO flavor.  We asked for extra soy sauce and duck sauce got not one pack with our 40 plus dollar order!  Not to mention asked for chopsticks got nothing.  How ridiculous couldn't get one thing of our order correct.  I called to complain and was offered 10% off our next order.  NO THANKS there won't be a next time keep your 3 dollars won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ordered here.  A nurse from the hospital recommended the crab ragoon so I had to try... Oh man was I delightfully impressed.  I am very judgmental on chinese food and this place was amazing! I ordered the sesame chicken box that came with sweet and sour chicken I also asked for shrimp fried rice and an egg roll all for $9 bucks.  What a deal! I will go back and definitely get the crab ragoon again!"}
{"text":"Zen is one of my favorite budget places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The sushi portions are great for the price, and the staff is friendly.  I was having a bad day recently, and they took time to make my sushi order especially fantastic.  I know it's not the fanciest establishment, but I couldn't recommend it higher. Bring your friends this sushi, tell them it was $12 per roll instead of $6, and they will believe you."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here. I got an eel roll and a soft shell crab roll. Both were not great and I ended up eating only a few pieces of each and throwing them away. I also got sesame shrimp which was decent.  It was nice to have a slightly healthier option."}
{"text":"We got delivery from this place through grubhub.com. Delivery was much quicker than expected. The spring rolls and chicken egg roll were very nice (the fried items we ordered, in other words, were the best part). The chicken fried rice was fine, acceptable but nothing special. The sushi (I think it was crab and avocado) was mostly fine but the rice had a bit of an overcooked, sticky texture. The tempura-fried ice cream, as a delivered item, was kind of hopeless and mushy. I had requested no mushrooms, in writing, on the order, but there still were mushrooms in the cashew chicken, but thankfully none in the chicken lo mein. Both the chicken lo mein and the cashew chicken left a lot to be desired. Tons of murky, brown, salty sauce on both of those last two. Everything was edible but especially based on those last two items (the main-dish items), I can't say I was impressed. However they have good prices, so we might try them again."}
{"text":"Zen is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  I love their sushi and seafood soup!  Sushi is made to eat right away I don't know why people want it delivered then complain about it not being fresh. Service is fast and people are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I picked up food from here for the first time last night. We ordered edamame, seaweed salad, one cucumber avocado roll, veggie lo mein, General Tso's tofu, & pad thai with tofu. The roll was a little underwhelming, but everything else was very yummy!  The edamame was warm and we didn't get any icky-looking bean pods. Seaweed salad is hard to mess up, but goodness knows some places try. The portion we got from Zen was appropriate for the price and very tasty. The cucumber avocado roll was skinny and dull, but that's kinda what we ordered, so no surprise there.   The entrees we ordered all looked appetizing right out of the bag. The pad thai had strips of fried tofu that were great and came with a slice of lime. This is a big deal for me because I really dislike when that lime is forgotten or replaced with lemon! It wasn't the best pad thai I've ever had & I'm not even sure it tasted much like pad thai, but the noodles were right & it wasn't too sweet & I enjoyed it anyway. The vegetable lo mein had a great savory flavor and all the veggies were cooked just right. The General Tso's tofu was the highlight for everybody. It was spicy with good-sized pieces of perfectly fried tofu and crunchy broccoli, all of which was covered in a very yummy, not-too-sweet, spicy sauce. Honestly, I can't wait to order it again.  As an added note, I picked up my order because I'd never been in here and you just never know what to expect from a Chinese restaurant that puts a menu on your doorknob, but next time I'll probably dine in. The inside of the restaurant is clean & inviting. After checking out their sushi station, I might even try a more exciting roll next time."}
{"text":"The sesame tofu was not really good..and I can stomach tofu. Even the sauce was bland. They also forgot my rice..or the $11 meal I got just didn't come with any which is equally disappointing."}
{"text":"Called and placed an order for pickup. Drove all the way to the restaurant and he told me he delivered it to my apartment. No refund. No nothing. Enjoy that tip, buddy.  Edit: the driver didnt want to wait at the apartment and we had to BEG HIM to stay in order to avoid going BACK TO THE REATAURANT. when we got back to the apartment the driver almost gave us the wrong order but luckily we checked it. He was also extremely rude and disrespectful to my sister.   So like I'd really recommend this place a lot  EDIT #2: THEY DIDNT INCLUDE THE CRAB RANGOONS IM SCREAMING  Edit #3: called and they're delivering the crab rangoons. or at least I hope they do delivery and not pick up.   Edit #4: I just found a piece of bone in my General Tso's"}
{"text":"I got horrible food poisoning from the general tso bento box. Like, laid up for two days and thinking about going to the hospital food poisoning. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Called 3 times and waited for 3 hours to get my food. Expensive. Didn't even give a spoon for Miso soup."}
{"text":"Meh. The delivery was sort of quick. The sushi was edible but nothing special. Tasted like grocery store sushi and the fried tofu was awful. Soggy and came with way too sweet liquid oil or something. Won't order again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Fast delivery. Was able to tip online which was helpful. I got the box meal. The sesame chicken was a little hard to chew but it was good. Will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered from Zen with grub hub and it was a very good experience. Food came in 20mins. Everything was hot and neatly packaged. The shrimp egg roll was really good. Crab Rangoon was awesome and a nice size. California roll was one of the best and a big sized roll. 1st time getting Dragon & Phoenix and it was great shrimp was large as with the chicken. I highly recommend ordering from Zen!! Only complaint is they didn't include forks but I didn't ask so it kinda my fault."}
{"text":"This was my favorite chinese food place to order delivery from my time living in Pittsburgh. It definitely gives the best bang for the buck, the portions are huge! Also they were very fast in delivering food."}
{"text":"I ordered from gubhub not realizing the restaurant was 17 min away from my house. I felt bad for making them drive that far. Despite this my food arrived within 30 min of me ordering it! My 3 delicious cold veggie roles were made well and tasted like they should. My large hot and sour soup was very hot despite the drive. To top it all off the delivery guy had parked on the wrong end of my block but saw me look out my front door for him and in turn ran all the way down the block to hand me my food all the while having a big smile on his face. It's so rare to get a smile from a delivery guy anymore especially after 9 pm. That is when I usually get home from work. Good food Great service. I will order again. (pickup next time! )"}
{"text":"Zen is our lazy sushi to go delivery system in Pittsburgh. They are consistent, inexpensive, tasty and deliver to our door. We order the sushi dinner for two probably about once every week and a half."}
{"text":"Without Zen Sushi I probably would not have survived these past 2 years of grad school! Their delivered sushi is top-notch and gives me life and energy to study! They also have delicious general tso's chicken. The only reason I'm not giving Zen 5 stars is because I once went to their restaurant front for dinner only to discover that it is definitely more of a takeout/order out place than it is a sit in. I don't recommend eating in, but that does not subtract from the greatness that is their food. Highly recommend for ordering out!"}
{"text":"The dinner bento boxes were great, and an incredible deal! For less than $10 I got general tso's, sweet and sour chicken, cheese rangoons, and chicken fried rice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In a neighborhood full of ever-opening expensive \"trendy\" places, Zen can be a refreshing alternative when you're simply in the mood for hole-in-the-wall, divey Asian. Their sushi rolls with salmon and tuna are pretty decent. However, stay away from their yellow tail/ whiter looking fish--least fresh looking sushi I have ever seen. They have really good bento box specials with large portions that make great leftovers. Delivery service is definitely efficient."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the food was pretty standard Chinese food, but the price was great! The sushi was good too, and how can you go wrong with three rolls for $11? I would highly recommend this place for lunch, especially for the price. The interior is nice as well, I'm definitely going to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews.  This is THE WORST food that I've had in a while. I should have known when I saw the bento box options were mostly American Chinese food.   We got chicken teriyaki and another order substitute beef.  The beef was tough!  And flavorless.  Plus there was something in it that looks like it could either be the stem root of an orange...or the eyeball of a small animal.  I'm not gonna look at it again because I'm sure (hope)  it's the former.  Veggies were also flavorless.    We also ordered the Eagle and Angel rolls:  horrible.  The \"crunch\" in the rolls were like stale bread crumbs, so the rolls were soggy and gross.  I really hope that this review is published because, for some odd reason, most of the negative reviews are hidden.    Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we dined in on a Monday night and brought our 1.5 YO.  It's BYOB so bring a bottle of Sake with you as you will want to enjoy it with their well made rolls.  Their General Tso's chicken and Pork Fried rice were very well made in a traditional American/Chinese form.  Nothing outrageous or funky here, just great sushi, rolls, and Chinese dishes.  Simple and clean food with friendly staff with Chinese fast food pricing so overall, a great value.  Go and enjoy as did we."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Please order the roll lobster tempura! Incredible taste! All their rolls are incredibly delicious, order whatever you want but, don't forget lobster tempura :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a diner bento box, WELL worth the money. Spring rolls are DELICIOUS. Delivery was quick, and kind!"}
{"text":"Budget sushi restaurants often skimp on either quality or quantity. Zen Asian Diner manages to underdeliver on both.  The $12 rainbow roll was the worst rainbow roll I have ever seen. One expects a rainbow roll to be topped with a wealth of many different types of delicious sashimi, reflecting all the different colours of the rainbow. But the Zen Asian Diner version of this classic roll is distinguished from the California roll only by three paper-thin slivers of fish, plus some similarly millimetre-thin avocado slices on top.  The $5.25 ikura gunkan-maki was about half the size I expected, being a mere 2 cm in diameter (try searching for images of ikura gunkan-maki on Google and count the average number of delicious red spheres and compare it to my photo).  The $17 chirashi had a decent variety of fish, but the quantity was small, and worse, not very fresh at all. It is far worse than the offering from similarly priced Sushi Too on Walnut street.  Generally, one should stay away from restaurants that claim to serve all the many diverse cuisines of Asia. Zen Asian Diner is no exception. The delivery service was pretty efficient though."}
{"text":"Wow. I just got by food delivered. Twice.  The first time, all my food was there (large egg drop, small wonton soup, edamame, fried rice, egg rolls), but one of the soup containers (small wonton) had broken in the bag. The delivery man told me that he would go get another one. I thought he was joking.  I ate my food, good portions, very tasty, and didn't think anything of it. The wonton soup was only a couple of dollars.  I get a phone call 30 minutes later, from the same deliver man, saying he had my soup. I couldn't believe it. And he refused an additional tip.  This place gets five stars for awesome service and really good food."}
{"text":"Two words that shouldn't go together, but actually do at Zen: Delivery Sushi. Definitely trust their delivery sushi rolls, as we have had them delivered multiple times. They always arrive fresh and at appropriate temperature. Their warm dishes are average, but appropriate for the price. Delivery is fast!"}
{"text":"Sushi is not even a little bit Chinese. I have a deep, deep love for authentic Chinese food and top notch sushi. But never at the same time.  However, I find myself in the following situation very, very often:  10 pm on a Friday. We're watching the Wire.  Sergeant Jay Landsman is eating what appears to be grocery-store-grade sushi in his office. Sushi sounds so good. How can  I continue to watch this show and eat sushi too? I need someone to bring me sushi.  Enter: Zen Asian Diner.    Not the best sushi I've ever had, but within 40 minutes (I live in Highland Park, they're in Upper Lawrenceville) I have sushi at my house.  And I am satisfied."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout. Typical American-Asian food but better made than most places. I like the Bento boxes, they are fun. The sushi is very good too. We actually ate in the restaurant, which I guess is not the norm. They have tables in there, but we were the only eat-in  customers the whole time. Apparently it is almost all take-out, because they did a lot of that. But I think sushi is better if you see the person making the rolls and it is served to you on a board instead of in a take-out box, so for sushi I would recommend just eating there. But definitely good either way."}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all! Ive ordered delivery twice. The first time the sushi tasted ok but only got a few pieces after a 25$ bill. Crab rangoons were ok though. Second delivery I ordered different items and twice as much thinking I would get more food for the price. WRONG it was still a small amount and terrible quality. Tempura was soggy, naruto roll sloppy and lacking, apps were cold, soggy, and tasteless. Learn from my mistake 35$ wasted."}
{"text":"The food had a good taste... But found metal in my food and they wouldn't refund full amount just the amount of what it was found in... Completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"It's okay but wasn't that good at all. Hour and half for delivery and they are only a mile and a half away. Forgot the peppers onions and pineapples with the sweet and sour chicken and the sour sauce was minuscule to say the least. Not enough to cover a full portion of rice and chicken. Sushi was warm although it may be my preference to have it cold. Won't be ordering again anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite quick Chinese/sushi place for lunch but over the last few years they have gone downhill. I ordered two rolls and a small hot and sour soup for lunch. The rolls were okay but small and the soup is slimy with no flavor. I cannot eat the soup because it is too thick and slimy. This will be the last time I order."}
{"text":"I can't help but agree with Shari G.  This place is great!   As a sushi lover, I was thrilled to have a new sushi place on my block... however, like Shari G., i was a bit skeptical about the new place because the previous establishment was a tad bit sketchy (not a place I'd order food from). This place has been totally renovated and has delicious food.  My favorite roll is the Spicy Girl.  The Summer Roll is also delicious!   The people are extremely friendly and price is right!"}
{"text":"Zen has become our favorite BYOB and sushi spot. It is delicious and very reasonably priced. We're usually the only people in the restaurant and I'm hoping to see more people go! The staff is incredibly friendly and kind. I really like supporting this place!"}
{"text":"Delivery was 30 minutes earlier than we were initially informed...which could be nice but also inconvenient since we planned things vaguely around their stated delivery time.  I got the teriyaki chicken with miso soup. Neither had any flavor. At all. The teriyaki only tasted of black pepper...seriously. The miso soup tasted like hot water.  The husband got two rolls; spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail.  Nothing to write home about.  He also got hot and sour soup and it was basically just mushrooms.  In the end it was about $35 to figure out we wouldn't order from here again...and I'm normally the one saying we always need to give places a second chance."}
{"text":"First off, we came home to a menu sticking from the door crack, skimmed through it and was instantly attracted to the free delivery service. The menu was extensive ranging from sushi to the typical chinese foods.  I noticed the nicely priced lunch menu for only $5.95. We ordered the sesame chicken which came with the 4 pieces of the california roll and the chicken with broccoli from the dinner menu which came with the 4 pieces of california roll and an egg roll.    I was satisfied with the quick delivery service, but the food was another story. Everything was overly sweet.  Especially the sesame chicken. It felt like I was eating packets full of sugar and msg. The california roll was okay...can't really mess up on a california roll.  But all in all, they need to revise their menu and make it simpler for customers to navigate.  I would not order from here again even if I fail to make dinner and it's the only place that offers delivery to my home....we'll see... :P"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bento Box tonight with a friend. Delivery was extremely quick which was awesome! I loved the idea of this because you get a mixture of a few different things for $10 so you can't beat the price. In terms of actual food and flavor it was somewhat bland. I was looking for a little more flavor. This place is very convenient for me but unfortunately I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Over priced for what you get, it's mall quality Chinese food. No utensils were offered or napkins and I was working outside.  Will be choosing somewhere else next time. My snapple also came like warm along with the water I ordered."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from here several times, and I have not yet been disappointed. I am so glad that we discovered this place as we have not seemed to find that go to Chinese delivery place yet... that was, until we found Zen.    We have ordered the following and have yet to be disappointed:  Chicken and Broccoli, Chicken and Broccoli (go easy on the sauce-- they actually did this perfectly), Scallion Pancakes (even great delivered), Egg rolls, Crab Rangoon, Orange Chicken (not even on the menu), Orange tofu (not even on the menu)... ALL AWESOME GOODNESS :)  The service is exceptional... if you want something that they do not have on the menu, they are more than willing to make it for you.  They are fast, portions are great and prices are more than fair in my opinion.  If you are looking for a good Chinese/Asian experience - I suggest Zen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese take out in Pittsburgh! You get huge portions for a great price and the food is never greasy."}
{"text":"I had pork dumplings which changed my opinion about pork dumplings. In a good way. My friend had teriyaki chicken, which was delicious. I had the Alaska and spicy crab rolls, they were pretty awesome. Great water and ice here. Friendly staff. Fortunes were horrible. Pretty good prices/specials too. Overall, you'll see me here again."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hr 45 min for delivery. The delivery was 45 min late. The food was cold and soggy. We didn't eat it. The restaurant would not refund our money."}
{"text":"I find the special rolls to be a tad small for the price. It's my go to place for a quick fix especially because I can walk to it in a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"I live very close to Zen so I get sushi from here often. Sushi is pretty good and seems to be reasonably priced and well portioned. Also good here, the egg drop soup and seaweed salad (even though that portion is pretty tiny) My husband and I both have tried ordering multiple other entrees from here and have not been terribly impressed. The rib tips were ok but the general tso's chicken was more breading than chicken and the lo mein was greasy and flavorless, definitely leaving a lot to be desired. Overall the convenience and the sushi have me coming back but I don't think that I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"We've been trying to find good Chinese food in Pittsburgh forever and trusted the reviews on Zen's only to be disappointed once again. We ordered delivery, which arrived 30 minutes late. Thankfully, before eating it, I cut some up for my 1 year old. This allowed me to see the raw/under cooked chicken! Both the sesame and general tso chicken. My California roll was HOT from being packaged with my meal. We decided to call gh and not risk eating anything. Zen's wound up calling us, and tried to tell us that they cut the chicken bigger than normal, and that's why it was under cooked. That may be, but from my time in the food industry, I know that everything leaving a kitchen should be temped before serving. Raw chicken can kill someone and shut down a business. They also told me that their California rolls were meant to be served hot.  What we did taste (some sauce, the egg roll, a bite of rice) was mediocre at best, so needless to say, our search for good Chinese in the Burgh continues."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese in the city- I've only gotten takeout or delivery from here and it's always on point, which you can't usually say about takeout and delivery- they do it right."}
{"text":"I got delivery from there and  it was disappointing. I got the sez. Shrimp and generals tso chicken and crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon had no filling in them. The general tso wasn't bad but they literally gave me 3 or 4 pcs of chicken. The sez. Shrimp was 99% onions, 3 shrimp. I also got an egg roll and a spring roll to try. They were average at best. For $23 I could've  definitely had a better meal somewhere else, especially considering all the good places to eat around me."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese food in PGH .The sushi is hot or miss, so many this is not the place for high grade sushi (keep it basic). BUT that does not make me throw any shade at this place. They have good food (I love the orange beef and Singapore mei fun) (not the scallion pancakes so much). and they deliver. Solid neighborhood chinese delivery spot that also happens to have sushi, take it or leave it. And btw, I live in bloomfield,"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here on yelp for delivery. It wasn't great and the delivery driver told me in so many words not to order from here again because I live too far away."}
{"text":"Over an hour for delivery. Food was repulsive. $60 worth of food all tasted horrible. Never again!"}
{"text":"They have great takeout box dinner yummy  And the veggie fried rice is mmmmmm good  I love Chinese food"}
{"text":"Zen has become our go-to spot for take out, delivery, and dine-in Chinese food closer to home.   While they also serve sushi, the only sushi that I've tried was a vegetable roll, which was okay, but the rice seemed slightly undercooked.   The real quality for us has been the service and the Chinese food. We've had delivery a few times, and our orders have always arrived as-ordered. While that should be the norm, it sadly hasn't been with other places. I even ordered the orange chicken, which isn't technically on the menu, and they always get it right! The chicken & broccoli is really good, and they'll make nearly anything as a tofu dish, if requested. I've ordered orange tofu with no questions asked! Not too shabby!  My favorite thing is the scallion pancake appetizer. I'm not sure why more places don't have them on the menu, but they're so yummy. A must-order if you're trying Zen. They even hold up pretty well when delivered!  If you're dining in, the space is pretty nice. You can tell it's been recently renovated. It's clean, but when we were in there it was dead, so the vibe seemed a little odd. Fortunately, the service was really good. The people that work at Zen are super nice and, as mentioned before, they'll basically make anything you request. Don't be turned off by the sketchiness from the outside. It's a generally good experience inside!"}
{"text":"This review is for take-out only. I had a rough day and I really just wanted Asian food, so I ordered the General Tso's tofu with steamed rice and my boyfriend ordered the Sesame Chicken with steamed rice.   We placed an order over the phone around 10:45PM on a Friday and they close at 11PM, but they assured us that they would deliver the food anyways. The driver seemed to be directionally challenged (he didn't know where the University of Pittsburgh is), so the mix up is probably what prolonged the delivery to around 11:45. However, the food was still hot and satisfying. There was enough tofu for three meals and they package the food in nice, reusable and microwavable packaging. The General Tso's sauce was spicy-- I love spice, but if you have a sensitive tummy I would probably go for the Sesame instead.   Best Chinese delivery that I've had in quite some time. The only downside is the $15 delivery minimum (the average entree is around $8-$9) and my lack of car on campus to pick it up myself. Craving some Chinese? Grab a friend and go in on an order for Zen."}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled really bad right when we walked in the door (like bad fish and old musty hotel), so that should've been enough to make us leave, but we stayed and gave it a try.  The service was good, but the food was really awful.  We ordered spring rolls and two different tofu dishes.  The spring rolls and sauces were bland and greasy, the broccoli was cold, and the flavorless tofu was over-fried so much that it was hard.  Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Straightforward sushi and Chinese food. Nothing innovative on the menu, but typical options are prepared with quality ingredients for a good meal. I never saw a big crowd in the dining area, rather it seems they do mostly carry out business. I lived a couple blocks up the hill so that's all I ever did!"}
{"text":"The food always arrives quickly. The avocado salad is so simple but it's always fresh and my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"My experience coincides with a few other reviews I read here.  I ordered delivery, and my order was 30 minutes earlier than they estimated.  Awesome for me at my hotel, but I see how it could be problematic for someone planning around delivery time.  Also, the crab rangoons, while tasty, do not have much filling, like others complained.  I got the steamed pork dumplings, and they are good, seasoned well and not all dough.  I also got the appetizer sampler, everything was good.  Overall, good experience, I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my fiance's and my anniversary, and we had to spend it waiting for a package to be delivered in a snow storm.  So instead of going out we decided to try Zen after a reccomendation from a friend for delivery.  Wow!  They said 45 minutes  but were there in 30.  I have issues with pricier delivery asian food- forgetting parts of orders, (we're vegetarian and having meat in things we requested meat free), taking a long time, etc.  The price was right, and the food was delicious.  We got enough food for like 3 days, and it was so good and filling.  Excellent vegetarian food, quick delivery, and they came in a snow storm. 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Made an order for pickup which was was easy and prompt. My sushi was very affordable and decent, nothing incredible. However, my boyfriend's general tso's tofu was truly horrible and what brings this down to two stars (generously). The sauce was insanely sweet, tofu was soggy and cold in the center. Boyfriend will typically eat anything, but actually threw this out."}
{"text":"Ordered via Grub Hub tonight. And this was disgusting! Over cooked chicken which was virtually jerky. Undercooked rice. And the teriyaki sauce was a strange black sauce over carelessly chopped vegetables. And who sells warm sushi? These guys. And as for customer service there was none not their problem. Better off taking a trip to giant eagle for Asian cusine then frequent this establishment in any way!"}
{"text":"I've gotten delivery from here probably 5 times prior to tonight. Tonight was disappointing to say the least. I ordered $40 worth of food. The chicken in the fried rice was gross and weird... It was steamed and tasted not fresh. There were a ton of onions in the fried rice, which is weird in itself. The sushi was pretty gross... It tasted like a week old. The delivery driver was nice though. Sadly, I will not be reordering from here. Thanks for the memories, Zen. Get some fresher food."}
{"text":"Great crab rangoon and they come in a group of 8 so it is a nice price for that amount. The shrimp roll I ordered were just okay nothing really to write home about. We also ordered some chicken fried rice which was the most bland fried rice I have ever eaten. It was basically just unseasoned brown rice with bland chicken. Maybe this will just be my crab rangoon place, but not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I just got a fortune-less fortune cookie from Zen Asian Diner"}
{"text":"It was a bad experience by all means. First of all it took them so long time to deliver . The order was missing sushimi pieces and the sushi rolls were very small. The food looked like it was left over the day before. I was hungry so I ate it actually it took me one minute to eat sushi order of 20 dollars , if you wanna have an idea about the quantity ! As far as the quality you gotta wait I will update the review if I get any diarrhea !"}
{"text":"The best part of my meal was my diet coke. We ordered take out. I chose avocado roll and fried sweet potato. My boyfriend chose pad Thai. My friend had honey chicken.  The sushi was nothing like sushi. While the rice inside was ok, it was especially bland. The seaweed used to wrap it was tough and rubbery. It was almost impossible to eat.   The pad Thai was not pad Thai at all. It was filled with onions and undercooked bean sprouts. It made me choke it was so awful.   The honey chicken and rice was plain and cheap. It tasted worse than McDonald's chicken.   Overall i am so embarrassed i paid money for this. Anyone who enjoys this food lacks tastebuds."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many times it's usually pretty good. But the last time i ordered i got sick and actually had to leave work. I hope it was a one time thing but from that experience im not sure if i would order from there again. I've also heard this place has had a bad rep with the health dept. Im giving it two stars because i've orderd many times and the food was good. But when it made me sick that made my opinion change very quickly."}
{"text":"Bleeeh.  Maybe the sushi is ok, but regular dishes are pretty bad.  We ordered carry out to the tune of $26 for two.  We got dishes filled with the type of filler crappy chinese places use- huge peppers, onions, zucchinni and mushrooms (which we requested be omitted) and some scraps of meat.  Not like any sheazuan beef i've eve seen. I expected better."}
{"text":"I would like to point out the spectacular service I received from this establishment... I recently made an order from Grubhub for delivery. After completing the order it was much to my dismay that this establishment was close to a half hour away from where I live. And there was a miscommunication from Grubhub that thought this establishment was close enough to me for delivery... However, after speaking with the manager of Zen Asian Diner, he felt so badly that we were unable to connect that he had his delivery driver travel the distance to deliver to me my order. I was not upset because the manager and I both agreed that an error had occurred in the location of the ordering process. I must give full props to the manager for going that extra mile to ensure that a customer was happy! The food was phenomenal! I enjoyed it greatly... I threw an extra tip in for the driver to show my gratitude. I hope it was worth your trip!!! But I am very satisfied with Zen Asian Garden and recommend it to anyone who enjoys great Asian food! Thank you for going that extra mile! It's rare to have an establishment go to the lengths this place did for me! So I will always have this story and this experience as one of my top 5 best experiences with a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery, big portions and good food. My family ate shrimp fried rice with very nice sized shrimp, General Tsao's chicken, cashew shrimp, and egg rolls. It was all very tasty for a night of take out! And I liked that I could order and pay online."}
{"text":"It's not me, it's you.  Sorry Zen but we have to break up.  I ordered delivery last night and it was a hot mess.  The crab ragoons were very greasy but edible.  The disappointment comes from the sushi.  The fish smelled really bad and after trying a small bite I threw the remaining pieces away.  The fish was clearly spoiled.  I'm going to have to venture back out into the dating scene of Chinese/Sushi food again as I'm officially back on the market."}
{"text":"Before this restaurant was Zen, it was my favorite. When it changed over I decided to stay with it and try the new. I was soo disappointed! I did not order sushi, but got two types in the container I picked up. The curry chicken with onions, my favorite was just not tasty at all. The food came4 in a Styrofoam three section box with the chicken in the smallest portion and the two sushis in the others. it was very disappointing and also maddening- I did not order sushi! I will not go back and have found another Lawrenceville Chinese place instead."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, it's really not that great or creative for Asian food. And the hot and sour soup I got with my meal was lukewarm."}
{"text":"SLOWEST DELIVERY EVER.   I've ordered from here a total of 5 times so far since we've moved into our new house, and every single time it has taken over an hour to arrive. Tonight, it took an hour and a half. I also mapquested it and it is only 6 min from my house. And we've only ordered 2 meals, it's not like we ordered for 10 people. The first 2 times they messed up our order. They forgot my California roll and then gave me rice instead of the sauce I asked for. The general tsos is gooey and there's really no flavor, the only good thing I've had so far was the California roll, when they actually decide to put it in my bag."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.  Food arrived quickly, in about 30 minutes.  I ordered the Singapore mai fun (sp?) which was very good.  The pan fried dumplings were the real revelation though.  Hands down the best I've ever had.  Incredible.  They were so good I had to order them again the next day.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that made authentic bento boxes for lunch and dinner; being a former SoCal resident I got spoiled with the multitude of Japanese places that made \"five dollar bento lunches\".  This place isn't bad, the renovations that they made to the interior are amazing but you still have to deal with the stench of rotting food in the summer when you are walking up or down the hill. The service is good if you are dining in but there is a delivery charge, something that other places like China House (Bloomfield) don't tack on to the bill.  I order the miso soup at least once a week because it's a steal (price wise) and it isn't as salty as other places.  I have only sampled the sushi when others have ordered it so I can't comment on it,"}
{"text":"My order for Zen was a complete disappointment after the good reviews I'd seen on the delivery site. The bento box was inedible, except for some of the pieces of shrimp which could be salvaged from the sickly sweet, overpowering sauce. The fried rice was just yellow and hard with no flavor or discernible trace of vegetables. The egg roll was all fried dough with barely any filling and the General Tso's chicken was all breading and in a weird sweet sauce. I guess that's just what you get for that bargain price of $8-10 for this combination.  On the other hand, the shrimp with broccoli was okay (at best). The portion was large and came with plenty of shrimp. The sauce was too sweet and gooey for my tastes, but it was edible. The steamed rice at least was done right - not at all hard like many Chinese takeout places. I would not order from here again due to the terrible bento box."}
{"text":"Good sushi and everything else is usually good...every once in a while it disappoints but for the most part it's good.  People are always nice.  Better than other Chinese places in the neighborhood for sure."}
