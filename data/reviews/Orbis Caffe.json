{"text":"Super cute atmosphere here. It's a little dark, but it feels kitschy and homey and is a great place to meet up with friends, or to bring a book or laptop and settle in.  The espresso is usually Intelligentsia (Black Cat) which is a big plus. They have a range of drinks for absolutely everyone, from coffee snobs to flavored-sugar-coffee addicts. That's a hard crowd to keep everyone happy, but Orbis does it right.  The batch brew coffee is priced well and sometimes is great, other days it is not-so-good. I wish it was more consistent so that I could count on a great cup every time. Sometimes it is very disappointing.  The snacks are great here too, and I look forward to a breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"Born and bread Pittsburgher now living in San Fran... So this stylish, inviting, delicious lookin coffee shop was a welcome site for a Sunday morning starter while back for a family visit. The Columbian coffee was recommended for more pour over. Good but not great. Felt like the coffee was cooler than it should be and had more bitterness than I'd expect when filtered properly for a pour over (which I make daily at home so I've scorched more than my share). The quiche on other hand were extraordinarily delicious ... Not creamy or high like a French quiche, more like an excellent frittata with a savory crust. Broc and Cheddar paired with Turkey and Saurkraut. Loved the audacity and flavor profiles. Definitely will be back this week to try other coffees and dishes!   Update: Came back on Friday of the same week... New crew so they didn't recognize me. They gained +1 star for their attentive service, new meatball quiche (WTH...crazy great butter crust), and an exceptional Honduras based Americano. Well done, Orbis! I look forward to my next visit to you when I'm back in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I check in to this place all the time. They have a great atmosphere and the people that work there seem nice. It's a solid spot for coffee. One of these days, I am actually going to go in there and have some coffee. I bet it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Got a cappuccino and quiche. Cappuccino was frothy and pretty decent.  The quiche was simple, potato and bacon with a flaky buttery crust  The atmosphere is welcoming and the ambience is simplistic. My only gripe - no comfy, sink in to settle, seating. The caffe just has run of the mill wooden tables and chairs.  Other than it's a lovely addition to Washington Road's growing culinary allure."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but speciality drinks are ok. Would not recommend the food. Nice seating and free wifi."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars, rounded up to 4 Stars I've been here for coffee drinks several times.  Each time the drinks were great.   I had brunch here twice.  The made-to-order food is tasty and fresh.  The granola biscotti in their case was just ok.  The service is somewhat lacking.  Be warned that the made-to-order brunch food is not served unto 10 AM (although a couple that ordered right after us was somehow allowed to order their brunch food at 9:45 and was served before 10 AM).  Don't come here if you plan on ordering food and are in a hurry (unless you are said couple aforementioned).   I'd definitely come back for food and coffee when I don't need to be anywhere."}
{"text":"I want to like this place as I used to love Aldo coffee co. The quality went down IMO and the focus is elsewhere rather than on the coffee. I made an attempt at purchasing a bag of intelligentsia beans and the roast date was a month past already and 19 coffee didn't even have a roast date on their bag to my surprise and they didn't have anything that pleased my palate anyway. I've now switched to their chai if I'm in the neighborhood as that is still delicious."}
{"text":"Love the coffee; wish there were more comfy, lounge type seating.  Important part of Mt. Lebanon community"}
{"text":"Home of my favorite chai teas and chocolate chip cookies in the world."}
{"text":"So cute! And maybe the best iced coffee I have ever had. The only drawback (besides it being pricey) is that I have never met a remotely friendly person that works there. I have definitely chosen other places because of the unwelcoming staff. Besides that, it has such a good atmosphere. The decor and even bathrooms are so lovely that it makes it worth going to just for that. I have never ordered anything, food or drink, here that I was less than really impressed with. Overall great!"}
{"text":"Had a great Espresso and a chocolate biscotti, wish I could have got a croissant or something besides a cookie. The folks who work there where really friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and each time the customer service is eh...We ordered two breakfast burritos that were cold in the middle. The outside had brown marks from the machine they toast them on which appeared warm, but the inside was not, at all. Considering the girl who brought them to us was only able to mumble a very faint \"you're welcome\" we decided to get our money back as it didn't really seem to matter if we were there or not. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop in Mt. Lebanon, PA. I would give it 3 stars because it is like so many other good-quality local coffee shops, but I'm adding a star because they have pastries baked right there. I had a cinnamon roll with icing, right out of the oven and warm. On a cold and rainy morning. Easily worth that 4th star, and I suspect that if I spent more mornings at this place they'd earn that star and maybe another one on their own."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years now. It was one of our favorite coffee spots from the beginning when we moved to Pittsburgh! Great coffee and tea selection and the food is incredible! We always order the quiche of the day, the recipe is always very creative and surprisingly delicious!   The thing you definitely want to try here is Sunday Brunch! The menu is always changing and once again always delicious. (I could go on and on)  The atmosphere is cozy and quaint. I'm telling you, you've gotta give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I grab coffees from Orbis almost 5 days a week between the two of us. We work in Mt. Lebanon and it a nice, local shop that we can walk to. The staff are always incredibly friendly, efficient with orders, and the coffee is on point! I like that they experiment with different flavors (lemongrass latte) and different roasts. They have a small box that holds frequent shopper cards so you don't have to worry about carrying yours with you all the time.  The shop is spacious with plenty of tables, even during busy times. Would be a great place to read/study as well.  Stop in if you haven't been yet. Guaranteed you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to kill time and ordered just an iced tea. The service was friendly and the tea was really good. Can't wait to live closer and stop by more often and try more things! Review updates to follow!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Uptown Lebo. Great strong European-esque lattes. The owners are from South Africa and plan a unique dinner on the last Friday night of each month with a different international theme. You register in advance and it's BYOB the night of. My husband and I attended a Caribbean themed night this summer in July. It was fantastic! Go with a group of people and you'll all be seated together. A wonderful experience. Small plates, tapas style.   Otherwise, this is a lovely cafe to step into for a scone with a cup of tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop. They have a few more options than some other similar coffee stores, including French Press coffee and pour over coffee.   There are plenty of tables--it seems more set up for dining. There aren't so many couches and large chairs that you see in other coffee shops.   I got a French Press and the quality of the coffee was very good. It seems there's a bigger selection of food compared to other like stores, but I didn't get any food.   Service was very good and prices about normal for this type of place."}
{"text":"Best local coffee shop hands down in terms of the coffee itself. I agree with some other reviews--service is unnecessarily slow and ordering can be a little intimidating if you aren't much of a coffee snob. Very spacious to hang out to get some work done, good wifi and cool AC in the summer months."}
{"text":"Visited this morning for a business networking breakfast.  Was very busy.  My first time at restaurant I didn't know that waitress brings food to your table.  We waited over ten minutes for our coffee.  There was a cup sitting on the counter and I asked the woman behind the counter if it was mine and she very very loudly told me to sit down and they will bring it to me WHEN IT IS READY.  Was really embarrassed in front of client.  Last time there for me.  And the French press coffee was terrible."}
{"text":"So let me start this review by saying that I'm not really a coffee drinker. My bar is set at Starbucks (and I just lost all the coffee snobs in the room).  Ok, for those of you still with me, because I admittedly don't like plain coffee, I am pretty much a lightweight when it comes to what I order. I have a standard toffee nut latte that I get from Starbucks on those rare occasions when I want to pump sugar and caffeine into my body, and that's about it. The thing about the toffee nut flavoring is that other than Starbucks, little local coffee shops with limited menus never seem to have it. So even though Starbucks sort of sucks (my coffee snob friend has trained me to taste how they burn their beans) I deal with it for my favorite drink.   Except for Orbis! I went in today and practically hugged the owner behind the counter when I saw that she had a bottle of toffee nut flavoring sitting there. I quickly ordered a toffee nut latte, and it was AMAZING. I finally had my favorite drink without any burned beans, so I could fully appreciate the flavors.  When you eat or drink in the cafe they serve you at your table, and I'm always impressed by the presentation. The drinks always have little hearts in the foam and the plates are served with a teensy garnish bowl of fruit - usually fresh raspberries and blueberries. They do a pretty big breakfast rush, complete with a Sunday brunch. Their quiches are always exotic and fabulous and today I had some sort of cookie with nutella in it and just about died from happiness. Oh, and I've been there before and can attest that they also have an awesome selection of loose-leaf teas (because I *am* a tea snob and understand that well).   Totally love this place's cafe atmosphere  - which is very cozy - and think the place is awesome. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Aldo Coffee used to be at this location, and that was one of my favorite coffee houses, so I was disappointed when it closed. I need not have worried, as Orbis Caffe serves up some delicious coffee and treats, and the vibe is the same laid back, chillin' and comfy atmosphere as it ever was. Try the chocolate hazelnut biscotti...delicious."}
{"text":"Best coffee ever. I travel the country every week. Recently in Portland looking for a great cup, found a couple but thought not as good as \"orbis\".   Enjoy the Vegan Blueberry muffins too.   Joe"}
{"text":"Service lets this place down. I'm the only customer in the place and I have to wait while the barista finishes her text?  \"Just a minute, I'm almost done...\" she says, while I stand there.   Customer lost."}
{"text":"Orbis has a wonderful sense of community, and it earns that well by being a locally family owned business.  The coffee is excellent and the staff is very friendly.  I attended their once a month international dinner and the food was over the top excellent."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my girlfriend in an attempt to get out of the blustery weather.  The inside of this place was comforting with lots of earthy colors between the dark brown wood color and blacks.  I decided to have an Americano to warm up while my girlfriend went with the jasmine green tea.  The tea came in a cute little red teapot for my girlfriend to pour herself and she enjoyed the flavor.  My Americano was both smooth and strong which was nice.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again.  I loved the comforting atmosphere and warm drinks on a cold day."}
{"text":"I hadn't visited Orbis since the name changed, so this Sunday I decided to walk up and get a latte. It was one of the best lattes I've ever had. The foam was thick and luxurious and the espresso was smooth and delicious. Its a little expensive for me to get more than once a week (but comparable to most large scale coffee shops), but I will defiantly be going back for a treat this weekend!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, delicious food options, and excellent coffee. I had the asparagus, Brie, and bacon toast and it was excellent. It came with a small salad that tasted like the vegetables were picked that day. It was clear that they only use fresh ingredients and make everything to order.   The cafe also has ample space and tables (double storefront) if you just want to sit and read or get some work done."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Awesome atmosphere. Love this place. The service is very friendly and the treats are always fresh and interesting. All around terrific coffee spot. Serves both the coffee fanatic and casual coffee drinker. Also, a very underrated component of a good coffee spot...the brewed coffee is always fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"I went there for a coffee I tried latte it was good but the cinnamon rolls was hard and not fresh. The staff friendly the place not bad. There are no wide choice of drinks and food."}
{"text":"Really cute little coffee shop I stop at while at work quite often. 9/10 the service is really good and friendly. I don't drink coffee so I comment on that bit their vegan blueberry muffins and mango smoothies are delicious!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick last minute brunch. Coffee and other drinks were pretty good. Breakfast sandwiches, toasts, bagels, etc were all delicious. I would definitely recommend getting something freshly made rather than the stuff in their case.  Only criticism is that the staff want very attentive and our food took an hour to come out. So, while the product is good, don't expect great and speedy service."}
{"text":"Organic blueberry scone.  And it tasted good.  I don't know how they did it.  Cool place."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry, don't order anything but black coffee. There were maybe 9 people in the place (all of which basically had their orders already) and the staff seemed over whelmed. The pastries are not over complicated and the quiches are heated in a microwave, bagels in a toaster. The espresso drinks are obviously made by a barista. But it still somehow takes forever with 4 people behind the counter to even have someone say \"hi, I'll be with you in a moment\" or anything for that matter. The isn't the 90s or early 2000s stop trying to act like an \"emo\" coffee shop employee and try to be friendly, not act like people coming to spend their money is somehow creating a huge pain in your day. This was my second time there in a month time...still disappointed by staff attitude."}
{"text":"A superior coffee shop with options for pour over or french press. Very good brews! The service was a bit slow but I think it's worth the wait if you have time. I really like the intelligista brand they sell on site here. The staff also seem Knowledgeable too about their beans."}
{"text":"I've been going to Orbis for a few years now, and while their coffee is of great quality, I can't say the same for the experiences I've had with the staff. While some staff members have been friendly, others have been openly rude-- there have been several occasions where I've been served with a sneer and stared down if I stay to have my coffee in-house. It's been so uncomfortable on those occasions that I've actually left the premises rather than buying another cup of coffee.  I have noticed, though, that if I \"dress up\" I am treated more civilly. This is more than a little repugnant. My apologies, Orbis, but this kind of treatment of well-paying customers is unacceptable and I would be remiss if I didn't alert others to this behavior."}
{"text":"Went to Orbis the other morning looking for a great cup of coffee. I had read one review that said they would do French press... As I walked in I admired the bakery case which was full of delicious looking treats. I asked if they could do a French roast, French press  & the millennial behind the counter said they don't really like dark roast coffee's & couldn't? When I asked what the darkest roast they had... Mention they had the same crappy blend of the week that Starbucks had Sulawasi. I think her for her time and walked out very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have had coffee drinks, teas, baked goods, sandwiches, and I've bought beans too. Everything has been delicious and beautiful. I like that you can eat in and clear your own table. The employees do wipe tables, so it's always clean. My only \"complaint\" would be about buying beans. Since they don't roast their own beans, they have to mark up the beans they buy from other purveyors, which makes it a more expensive spot to buy. I will continue to eat and drink here, but buy my beans elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had a headache. I was tired. I was hungry. The symptoms of waking from slumber were stronger than usual. And yet the charm of Mount Lebanon and the approach of Orbis Cafe gave me hope, and I slyly persuaded my henchbrethren of the need to stop.   Orbis Cafe differs from your normal specialty coffee shop in that it's willing to cater to hipsters and 85 year old grandpeople alike. It's a quaint little shop with some beautiful touches but without the meticulously crafted designs of their significant friends in some other parts of the city. The baristas seemed more flustered and less calm and cool, and yet happy. It's just a place that is capable of pleasing the connoisseurs without turning off the common people. A bit hidden is the obtainability of such a quality thing as a pour-over using Ceremony or Intelligentsia coffee. But it's true! You can even spend $40 on a few ounces of rare coffees like Geisha, Eugenioides and Sudan Rume!   They also carry local 19 Coffee Roasters which I had to try, in the form of a Colombian pour-over. I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be about a 9.5. On a scale of 1-17. Not bad, not amazing. BUT, there was the heavenly broccoli Brie quiche.   I was revived. I was awakened. I was filled."}
{"text":"I tried this place awhile back and didn't have a great experience. I think it was partially me being slightly intimidated by their broad offering and the barista, who was working by herself, being really busy. So I gave that lackluster experience a pass and kept an open mind for giving it another shot. Glad I did because I had an excellent cappuccino. It really tasted amazing. Unfortunately they only make it in one size, but when the quality is as good as this, that's ok by me. They have a smallish selection of baked goods. Must admit, they are not at the level of the neighboring coffee house up the street, but they are still good. Also, when making that comparison, the crowd here is a more on the professional side and 30+ compared to the 20+ and moms w/babies & strollers. Neither better than the other, just an observation and nice to have two good options in the same area. Decor inside is cool with a Roman/Grecian vibe, high ornate ceillings and hardwood floors. Also, free wifi!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday morning to get some work done. Ordered a chamomile tea and the honey nut oatmeal. All was delicious, especially the oatmeal! WiFi worked great also. :)"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a coffee shop other than Starbucks since we were transferred to Pittsburgh. We have found one in this shop. They made a perfect London Fog for me which I haven't had since we moved here. My spouse had his usual Mocha which was also one of the best. It's our new coffee spot when we're near enough to stop in."}
{"text":"Good choices of coffee and nice food for a quick bite. Comfortable environment and moderate noise for work."}
{"text":"It's kind of pricey, but I get that every time I pay $4 for a latte, it's really just paying for wifi and rent for the next hour that I'm going to spend there while I chill and sip my coffee.   I drink a lot of coffee, so the first thing I had to do when I got there was use the restroom. I'm not ashamed to say it. Bathroom cleanliness is important when you've got a tiny bladder like mine. And actually, the bathroom is super chic. It's decorated in a kind of Japanese theme and I'd give it a 10/10 on the neat & tidy scale. So there's that.   I appreciated my latte art by my barista which really matched the time and care they put into the store's decorations. It's really diverse from African masks to Japanese umbrellas to daisies to Seurat-inspired paintings. You feel more cultured just by parking your toosh there for a while.   I had a medium Hazelnut Latte and a great time and I only left $5 lighter than when I went in."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good coffee, tea, or treat, Orbis has it.  Coffee is excellent and the staff is great.  Have met some friends that tend to hang here and have never been disappointed.  Have had a few treats, bagel my last visit was good.  Have not tried but others have had some egg wraps that they said were good."}
{"text":"Stopped over here after lunch with family to check out this place. It is very spacious and has free  WiFi available. Their signature icon appears to be a moped bike which I noticed everywhere including on ceramic coffee cups for sale in the center of the cafe.  They have a good selection of coffees, expressos, both hot and iced as well as a vast selection of teas. Hot chocolate is also available. In addition they have a small menu of lunch items including quiches. I inquired about the pastries and learned that the majority of them are made down the street from scratch by an Italian lady. Some of the others are made in house which are brought in frozen and then they prepare them. They did identify which were made in house and which were made by the lady down the street.  The counter lady let me sample a blend of coffee before purchase. I was pleased with the taste and decided to order that along with a pumpkin biscotti made by that Italian lady I previously referenced.  My coffee was served in a ceramic cup and my biscotti on a rectangular plate. Both were very good and was well pleased with service I had received. Desserts range about $1.50 give or take. Take out service is available.  Can't wait to try the quiche but will have to save it for a return visit. It looked delicious and I'm sure it is."}
{"text":"Wandered in here while waiting to go to another meeting.  Ended up having a quiche (delicious) and a latte.  It's a nice space and the staff were all welcoming.  Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Had some decent coffee here (cortado and cold brew). The decor was cool and the music was decent. The yogurt with granola was awesome! The place is HUGE so there is plenty of seating. I'm picky with coffee reviews, so I knocked a star off just because I had better coffee at a different shop in Pittsburgh."}
