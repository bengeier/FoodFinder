{"text":"If you're gonna have Noodles in your name you should probably know how to cook them...
The beef and shrimp in the Japan bowl were prepared well. The starchy glob of noodles were the worst. Pretty much ate the shrimp and beef, then tossed the noodle glob in the trash.
This was at Cubs spring training for reference."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad Thai Noodle Bowl at the Cubs Spring Training game yesterday. Delicious! Made to order so be prepared for a bit of a wait but worth it. I asked them to hold the tofu and add chicken. They made it right, it was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"From the start, the woman who took our order was very unfriendly.  I was still excited to try these noodle dishes.  The presentation was nice, fresh cilantro and a mini-slice of lime.  We ordered chicken pad Thai and the Japanese noodle dish with shrimp and beef.  The noodles were so over cooked and starchy.  The sauce on the Japanese noodle dish was cloyingly sweet and heavy.  The Pad Thai had little flavor, if any.  I was so disappointed after spending 30 dollars two bowls and sodas.  I wanted so badly to enjoy it, but was so disappointed.  I hope this was just an off-day for this place because I do love local food trucks and want their success, but this place needs friendlier service and a revamp of their recipes."}
{"text":"A few lunch trucks are at work during some remodeling and decided to give it a GoGo since I like Pad Thai, which was on the menu.  

Every truck has a specialty and this was definitely not it at all.   I don't even know what I had because it didn't taste anything remotely like any other place that I've had Pad Thai.  I have never been served Pad Thai with a clear sauce. The dish was made up of over cooked rice noodles, some sauce that tasted like reduced Gatorade, some pieces of tofu (which were very well prepared), a piece of green onion, a slice of like, and a sprig of cilantro.  It made me laugh seeing the same style of peanuts garnishing the dish because someone got a little carried away.  

This dish either needs to be changed or taken off the menu because it's rather gross.  I ended up throwing it out after a few bites of the noodles. 

I am really picky with tofu and really liked it in this dish, after wiping off sauce residue."}
{"text":"This food truck was at our building for lunch today.

First, their number of selections was impressive. 
Second, the food that I ordered, referred to as Kremlin Stroganoff, was absolutely delicious!  I would order that once a week and would never have to prepare Beef Stroganoff again in my life!"}
