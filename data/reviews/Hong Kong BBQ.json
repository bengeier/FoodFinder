{"text":"It's inside the mall and the food is awesome! Probably the best authentic Chinese dinner you can have on Christmas Eve in North Carolina. Just don't peek in the kitchen. You're all good."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as you're going to get.

I'll be straight up when I say that places like this can make me nervous.  The mall itself is sketchy...and it's in a sketchy part of town.  I make it this way every few weeks for some bánh mì at Le's, but came on a day that Le's was closed.  Dim sum?...or the place with ducks hanging in the window?  We opted for the ducks in the window and chose Hong Kong BBQ.

When you enter Hong Kong BBQ...you can tell there's going to be a communication issue.  There is literally...not a single thing resembling \"American\" in this restaurant.  I knew I was going to like this place.  I did my best not to look back at the kitchen.  We all know what that is going to look like...and I'd rather play dumb.  Dangit!  I looked.

The service was quick and the food was great!  We were even entertained with Chinese soccer on their small TV.

I'd recommend coming here if you're an adventurous person...otherwise...you'll never make it as far as the door...much less the table."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough... I get off the highway just to grab lunch from here. Remind me of the authentic Chinese take outs in NYC"}
{"text":"Missing Hong Kong BBQ... found this on Yelp and was excited to try it.

But, the BBQ pork was extremely dry... was disappointed. However, the service was good and they had the ginger/green onion sauce which is a plus as most places either wouldn't have it or would charge you extra for it."}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It helps to have someone understand the language while in the Hong Kong BBQ, but they do have english menus that you can use on the counter.  It is pretty cheap for some good food.  Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours.  Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.

Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall place. I was actually picking up banh mi sandwiches and saw this place. The duck and pork were prepared as well as the places I go to in ATL. I will definitely be stopping by this place again when I'm in the area."}
