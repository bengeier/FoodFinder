{"text":"I'm surprised not a lot of reviews have came through for the Hatch brewery despite so many coffee enthusiasts uptown.

I was looking for freshly roasted coffee, only to find a few locations in Markham / Richmond Hill. I have had Hatch coffee from several coffee shops and was excited that I can buy fresh beans in store rather than online.

The location is not obvious as a retail storefront, but the space is clean and does serve fresh coffee and various beans and mechandise. The only downside is that on most days, it closes by 5pm and not open on weekends, so it's difficult to actually come and visit.

The door rings when you enter, and there's also a bell to press for assistance. The place is not heavily staffed, so you might need to wait as they might be at the back. I was greeted by a staff who turns out to be the owner Alphonso. I told him how I found out about their beans and what I'm looking for, and was happy that I can pick up a freshly roasted batch of the beans I wanted (300g packages).

They also serve drinks and cold brew, as other reviewers mentioned.

After talking with Alphonso, he hosts coffee brewing workshops that you can sign up for, but limited to small number of spots. The storefront is a little busy in April (you can ask him why in person) but otherwise he is super friendly and gave me tips for brewing.

Will definitely come back to try other products!"}
{"text":"Hatch is a coffee wholesale that ships their own coffee to customers as well as providing monthly subscriptions to coffee lovers! We walked in and the place was aesthetically pleasing since the store was all white with wood tables covered with different types of coffee beans. We were able to sample a couple of their coffees and the associate was nice enough to explain the company and where there coffee beans are sourced too. Hatch also offers classes to learn how to brew their own coffee! Even though this isn't a cafe, you are still able to purchase a cup of coffee for a couple dollars!"}
{"text":"Jennifer K., a coffee connoisseur, introduced me to Hatch, a little piece of heaven for coffee geeks. It's kinda set up like a lab and they do custom roasting and blending of coffee and tea, and also bottling. They have something to suit every taste, or they'll make it!

We sampled some coffee that was prepared in a very precise and scientific (geeky?) manner. The beans were freshly roasted, a portion weighed on a scale and ground. A beaker (yes, a beaker) was placed on the scale and hot water carefully filtered into it through a drip maker and then poured out. The ground coffee was placed in the drip maker and more hot water was carefully poured over it until it got to a certain weight on the scale. This is not how I make coffee at home. Maybe I should. The coffee was good.

I also sampled some of their cold brewed coffee, with their Signature Blend being my favourite. I would have sampled even more but this little venture kept me awake past 3:00am. Thank you, Jennifer K."}
{"text":"I am bias. 

I have this thing for local business that is friendly, innovative, enthuiastic and love what they are doing.

And Hatch is one of them. They do Coffee well. Single Original Beans roasted on site and Cold Brew. The roast is lighter but I do like their Scandinavian concept from packaging to produces.

Great for french press and pour over. Especially if you are into lighter roast with a citrus or floral note.

Drop in for tasting is welcoming. You can meet the roaster and do some coffee geek talk.

All their coffee and cold brew are available for order online or at the roastery. And you can also enjoy them at Millie Crepe in Marhkam."}
