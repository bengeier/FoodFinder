{"text":"Terrible.  I waited 2.5 hours for my order.  Then when it finally arrived the containers were less than half full and were vegetables only.  I dont mean this in a sense where Im being overly picky.  There was not a single piece of pepper steak in there.  This place is doo doo will never order again"}
{"text":"We ordered crispy egg rolls, crab won tons, sweet and sour chicken, and the special beef pho. The egg rolls and crab won tons were delicious. Both crispy and still warm. The sweet and sour chicken was more of a soup (in a soup container). This was not what I was expecting at all.   Also, the delivery was about 30 minutes late and when we got our order delivered, all the heavy items were on the top of the bag.  Wouldn't necessarily redommend."}
{"text":"I tried them and they're nothing special. The pho came with none of the stuff it usually comes with from other places."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE you leave with take out they got the soup right but the spring rolls WRONG...If there is anything I cant stand its an order fucked up by someone when I physically point to it in the menu"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place through Seamless. (I would've reviewed them on that app, but I couldn't find a place to do so...) Not only were they almost half an hour late in delivering to me, I ended up having to call them to see where the girl was, and when I didn't hear back from either the restaurant or her, I had to call Seamless Customer Service and see what was going on. They ended up taking 20% off my order, but I still don't plan on ordering from them ever again. When she finally got to me, my noodles were congealed into a hard sheet; I had to reheat them in the microwave, and they were still barely edible. I paid $0.50 extra to have no ice in my Thai tea, and guess what, it came with ice! I'm not normally the type to make a fuss over $0.50, but come on. I also didn't really appreciate how, when she finally called me, the delivery girl complained to me about how \"confusing\" my neighborhood apparently was. I don't really think that's my problem, especially when I was both giving her detailed instructions on how to find me as well as standing on my front porch so she would see me."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since my favorite spot is closed for a month for a family vacation. I got the pho tai and asked for a Vietnamese iced coffee. She said she was out of condensed milk but offered a Thai iced coffee . I declined. The broth tasted more like chicken noodle soup broth which I am not a fan of. The sprouts were not fresh and on the verge of turning bad. Also, as mentioned in a previous post, the meat looked like it was not frozen while still fresh or it was meat that would be thrown away the next day.   I had hoped to find a spot closer to home but will be waiting impatiently for the month to go by so I may return to another spot.   I do not recommend this place for pho."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now and the quality has been consistent and yummy - I have only had the Chicken Pho, and Shrimp Spring Rolls but both were satisfying. Pulled white chicken meat for soup,  broth delicious, and I have never found any poop trails in the shrimp. If you are looking for a yummy soup to beat the flu season..order up. :)"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered food to be delivered off of Grubhub, they told me my order was cancelled. I went on to leave for lunch somewhere else and right before I walk out the door a lady shows up with my food. I told her that my order was cancelled. She called Grubhub just for Grubhub to say that the restaurant itself cancelled my order. The next day I get the same order for them to deliver the food I got with RAW MEAT! I had to cook it on the stove before I put it in my food. So unprofessional. I'd be surprised if I ordered from here again. Shame."}
{"text":"Over all quality of food was poor. Ordered through Uber Eats and the driver stock around to inform me of poor customer service, a dirty fish tank and a very humid restaurant. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"Good pho and Tom yum but worst papaya salad I've ever had. Don't recommend that at all"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by these reviews. This place is the real deal and the pho and wonton soup we've had are the best!!"}
{"text":"I've done delivery through Eat24 several times and each time it has been awesome! Lots of veggies, good noodles & broth. And the folks who keep talking about the raw meat, don't order the rare beef if coming that way freaks you out. That's the way it is supposed to come so it gently cooks in the broth."}
{"text":"So I asked for extra noodles. They charge an extra 2 bucks that won't be added to my card. I must pay cash. All I had was a 20 and the person doesn't have change. Screw this place. You guys are horrible at customer service. Next time call the person to tell them so they know in advance. Never again."}
{"text":"I don't know how they serve this in the restaurant, but ordering on the phone was a first for me , in my many years of eating Pho, this was the biggest most disgusting food ever! seriously,  Pho usually costs about 7 to 10 bucks , with the tip I spent 18, okay fine I wanted Pho , and thought about trying this on a night I was so tired, I ordered \"RARE\" not raw steak, I got cold soup, and raw steak to put in it, It was the worst. I would never eat from this place again! RIP OFF I have learned the error of my ways, I will try a restaurant before I order from them on GRub HUb..."}
{"text":"It looks questionable, but the flavor is delicious! Yummy Pho in the neighborhood. We got the Well Done Brisket Pho, egg rolls and Peach milk tea."}
{"text":"I went here because it was close and  by the video store I was at  since I was there anyway worst pho ever basil was brown and yucky meat looked like it was going bad no jalape√±os no chili or plum sauce  taste horrible  throwing it away I will never again boooo on you pho  an an  go to Simis best pho around"}
{"text":"Pho was decent but nothing spectacular. It's actually the same restaurant as Papaya Thai, which now serves both Thai and Vietnamese menus. Definitely exciting to have a pho restaurant in this area, and I would come back if the craving hits."}
{"text":"Over all decent but meh. Delivery came really quick and the food was still warm, but being that I ordered the rare meat, and it's SUPPOSED TO COME RAW I wanted the broth hotter. Yea don't be fooled for freak out at the other post because if you order the rare beef for take out or delivery, the meat is wrapped up raw because it cooks in the hot broth. Same way they do it in the restaurant.  Spring rolls were decent, needed maybe a little less lettuce and more herbs. Meatballs in my pho were gross, don't get those. They had big chunks of grissle in them.  Also, I didn't get a lime but a lemon, maybe it's because I ordered so late.  The basil was starting to go as well If I'm in the area and have a craving for pho I may come here again, but overall didn't knock my socks off. Doesn't deserve as bad of a score as it has on yelp though."}
