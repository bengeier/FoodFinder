{"text":"Very bad customer service. Unbelievably rude. Don't ever get there delivery service. Because if they mess up on your order they are not going to fix it unless you order more food. Besides the food is not all that good.  My advice to the owner of the restaurant is to train your employees on what's acceptable customer service and good hospitality here in The United States."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and Surang just might be the best one in Vegas!!!  I was a regular at Archi's but decided to try somewhere new and success!!!    Tucked away in a strip mall, I'd never expect this place to be so good!!  Walking in, the boyfriend and I were immediately impressed with how delicious the place smelled.  We ordered the tom yum goon (hot and sour soup with shrimp), papaya salad, Thai beef jerky, pad kapow (minced chicken and basil), and basil fried rice.  Everything came out piping hot (which I'm really picky about).  Flavor-wise, definitely at least a 9 out of 10.  Only thing is that we wished it was spicier.  We ordered an 8 spicy (out of 10) on everything but it was medium spicy at most.  At least our mouths weren't melting off.    We are Thai food frequents so we will definitely be coming back.  This actually might be our new regular, go to take out spot.  Horray to finding a new delicious, authentic Thai restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place! I love authentic flavor! No short cuts here. Best Thai tea in Vegas! The staff is friendly. Yen ta-fo is a must have here! The perfect about of sour and mixed with seafood! YUMMY"}
{"text":"We are former \"Vegan\" natives and moved to SoCal. There are many Thai food restaurants here, but nothing beats Surang's! Their spices and textures are just right. Basil chicken and satay are my favorites. My husband loves the pineapple fried rice and Panang beef. I do believe one of the chefs used to work at Archies(our 2nd fav), but this one pays more attention to the quality of the dishes. I notice there are so many good reviews, so I guess it's no longer our best kept secret! It's everybody's! Just make sure when you give them a heat rating, describe how hot as well."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmm.......Excellent Thai food, awesome staff & worth the extra drive for the quality of Thai food at Surang's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Surang's, good food, good service and decent prices here."}
{"text":"Amazingly nice staff , been coming here for years getting consistently good service ! Food is always amazing , fresh , & hot & is prepared quickly , love this place!... Recently visited again the other night and I am continuously blown away by the awesome service !!! Top of the line for and awesome atmosphere love taking close friends here !!"}
{"text":"Just got back from my weekly visit to Surangs and wanted to write my review before I went into a food coma from all the pad thai I got!  Like Alma mentioned I also prefer Surangs to Archis.  I've been coming to Surangs for almost 6 months and haven't been back to Archi's once in that time.   The service here is always great, as soon as I sit down they know my order (maybe I sign I come here too often).  I usually get a pad thai with chicken or a spicy basil with chicken lunch special with 4 on spice and its got just the right amount of spice without taking away from the dish.  Besides the standard food you'd see at every Thai restaurant they also have a crispy pork dish which is fantastic.  It is either saute'd with zucchini or chinese broccoli.  I'd highly recommend the crispy pork and this restaurant to anyone in the mood for Thai food!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! And service was great, the waitress was kind and patient with us. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"When we pulled into the shopping strip Surang's was located in, it was dark and I felt like we were heading into a trap from a horror movie. And then I saw the open sign which made me feel a lot safer. It is located in a small venue, which had a very clean, simple and relaxing atmosphere.  We started with some appetizers and I would recommend getting the shrimp cakes, these things were so good I was tempted to just order that all night.  There were four of us and we ordered a Beef Panang (level 8 spiciness), chicken pad see-ew (no spiciness), basil crispy pork and chicken/beef pad Thai (level 8 spiciness).  I'll start off by saying the curry and rice were the best together, the curry was spicy and it had a sweet tinge to it. The beef was soft and easily chewable. I just wish the green beans served would have been softer, I feel like they were undercooked. Other than that, the dish was excellent and highly recommended.  The pork was decent, reminded me of filipino liempo but the skin was sometimes unchewable. It was my first time having it so maybe it'd be worth another try.  The pad see ew was the spiciest, I could tell my nose was starting to feel it and it took two plates of pad thai to take away the burning sensation. I'd recommend going lower if you're not a fan of spice.  The pad thai was excellent and I'd recommend getting it. This is probably one of the stable Thai food all around, it never fails anywhere you go. In my opinion, the beef/chicken mix is great with any of these dishes.  Next time I go here, I'd order the shrimp cakes, pad thai and curry. That right there would be an excellent meal for lunch or dinner.  The service was good and very tentative. It may have not been so busy but you get better service when tables in restaurants aren't full. They also offer take out, which is a definite plus for when you're in a hurry or want to eat at home.  Altogether, I'd take family or friends here. It's a great place to fill up your stomach and fill that Thai craving we all seem to have."}
{"text":"Great dinner and relaxing ambience. I ordered the Panang curry and it was really tasty and the portion was the perfect size. Definitely a good restaurant to bring some friends or your family. I really like that they have flexible spicey levels. Also, they give you free Thai Ice Tea if you leave a yelp review!! Basically the best Thai restaurant in Vegas, and boy do I know Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I try to order from them once a week. They always recognize me when I pick it up. And when I feel lazy I get their delivery and they are always fast and hot.  My favorite items are their beef salad, masaman curry and Thai jerky. but I like to try everything on their menu and I'm never disappointed.  It's great to have a place so close to home where the food is prepared well and they are friendly and fast. Thanks for doing a great job!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!!  We frequent Surang's very often and have never leave disappointed. There are plenty of other Thai places that are considerably closer to our home, but we like this place so much that we make the 30+ minute drive for a delicious meal. I like the Kung Pao and Cashew Chicken dishes, which like most Thai places offer you a level of spice/heat that seems to fit my fancy if I am looking for an extra kick in my meal. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. Nothing special about the decor, but when the food is that good, there is no need to care about the decor."}
{"text":"I work about a block away and go once a week for lunch. Their lunch specials are a great deal at $8 and you get a full meal! The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Ordered tonight for the first time.  Yelp reviews were positive and it was convenient close.  I was totally impressed!  Portions were great, food was packed surprisingly well and the taste was amazing.  I will order from here on a regular basis.  Check out their spicy eggplant!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Thai, like so many of these restaurants they have had to cater their food to the local client base which is primarily Caucasian. The flavors are plain not rich, the spiciness non existent. The food is not terrible, you can eat here, just don't have high expectations...."}
{"text":"Meal was a bit too salty and service was unacceptable.  Had to approach the waiter to both order and pay.  Waiter did not even ask how I was doing in midst of my meal.  Would not recommend it nor would I return."}
{"text":"i love this place!!! atmosphere is down to earth like any cafe and the food is authentic as it gets!!! i should know, i'm thai... try the country curry!! if u like spicy soup, my hubby likes the crispy pork and broccoli!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place via yelp and driving past it almost every day and having the guts to try something new. Had had Thai Noodle Kitchen for the first time a couple days before (which I found to be somewhat bland AND gave me the runs).   Cute little place in a non-descript strip mall. Have not dined-in yet, have  only done take-out (now multiple times).  But take-out service has consistently been superb. Stated wait time has never been longer than 10 minutes and food has always been ready by the time I've arrived.   Have only had the pad thai chicken, but I think it's the best I've had in Vegas so far (over Archi's, Thai Noodle Kitchen, Panna Thai, and Pin Kaow). The spiciness level is a little higher than my baseline - I always get a zero (on 1 to 10 scale) and it was still a little spicy. My husband got a 2 and found it too much for him to fully enjoy.  Nonetheless, I can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here last night and ordered to go.  The waitress was very friendly when I walked in and they had my food ready in 15 minutes from the time I called.  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai with a spiciness level of 9/10, Spicy Basil Pork 8/10, Thai Fresh Spring Rolls, and Thai Iced Tea.  My basil pork was oily, but had decent flavor.  The spiciness factor in the pad thai and pork dish were lacking.  When I called in my order, I kept mentioning that I preferred it \"extra spicy\", but they played it safe and it was more like a 2.  I had to douse it in hot sauce when I got home.  I did like that they had brown rice on the menu and the thai iced teas were tasty.  I may try to dine-in next time and order the Tom Yum Soup and a Thai tea to go!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Thai food, could probably eat it everyday if I could.  The Pineapple Curry was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and fast! Food was delicious and priced well. Pad Thai was portioned great for sharing and the flavor was excellent! Would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken green curry with very deep flavor. Pork pad kea mow was outstanding, spring rolls the freshest ever! Great value and very fresh food. Cute restaurant with friendly staff. The best Thai in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great place to catch a meal on the way home! Service is quick and the clean kitchen is visible from the register."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Service and food is awesome. the chicken pat se ew is also my favorite. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I try to go out for a weekday lunch date whenever we can.  One of our favorites places is Surang's Thai Kitchen for the weekday lunch specials.  We've been there quite a few times and we've always been extremely satisfied.  I usually get the chicken with mixed vegetables (0 spicy), while my boyfriend is more adventurous - trying the spicy basil with pork, kung pao chicken & kung pao beef.  The first time we went there, he had 5 spicy, but he now orders 10 spicy, adding extra jalapenos & red chili pepper flakes they offer.  His eyes are red and watery while he's eating, but they usually are back to normal by the time we get back to our car LOL.  All lunch specials come with a won ton, a spring roll and green salad with a nice dressing.  Yummy.  It also comes with a cup of soup - we have had the egg drop soup, the chicken-cucumber soup and the hot & sour soup - all VERY yummy.  We always have the same waitress - very pleasant, always smiling and always attentive.  My boyfriend and I always enjoy our lunches here."}
{"text":"I got the silver noodle salad. Great size for the price and super tasty. They ask a spicy level of 1 to 10. I ordered a 3 which still had a good kick so be careful. My waitress was very friendly and the place is nice. Yum!"}
{"text":"Surang's is one of my favorite Thai places in Vegas.  Their service is always fast and friendly and the food is great.  My favorite dishes are the Cashew Chicken, Masaman Curry, and Pineapple fried rice. The mango and sticky rice for dessert is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Grade A quality food as well as quantity. Always good service. Love the place.  Whenever you step in they smile and make you feel welcome.   MUST TRY: Spicy fried rice. You pick your level of spicy from 1-10."}
{"text":"Very good fine family restaurant  We be back again !! ?????????  ????????????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????"}
{"text":"I think this place just made it to my default lunch spots list.  The lady there today was really nice and attentive not to mention the food was good.  I tried the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special and along with a thai iced tea.  To start off, I love the thai iced tea and it's a pretty large cup compared to some other places I have been to.   The pad thai was also a good portion, at least for me. There are times when I get a chicken pad thai at other locations the chicken can be a bit dry, but not this place.  I have tried other restaurants around the area, not just thai but this is the first place that I would say I did not feel like I wasted money on bad food and I left satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place, I should put 5 stars but the ladies know me there and I pretty much order the same thing... BEST shrimp pad thai in my book and the Fried Pork with Chinese Broccoli is sooooo good.. 4 stars because they serve it with less and less Chinese Broccoli and it's kinda pricey but it's very good. :)"}
{"text":"My friend took us here because it is near her hpuse. We were greeted by friendly staff. The service is fast and excellent. Food is okay-- a little bland. Just make sure to add a little spice."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I was trying to find a restaurant close to my house. I stumbled upon Surang's Thai kitchen and it didn't disappoint! I love red curry & pad Thai and both options were amazing. The pricing is average and the quality is excellent! They didn't have a delivery driver on the night I called so I had to run and pick it up, but the service was great!"}
{"text":"Surang's food is on par with places like Archi's, Corner Thai or Panna. I get takeout here often and it is reliably good. If I was going to dine in, I might choose Panna or Le Thai, but Surang's is a solid Thai takeout choice."}
{"text":"I have been eating Pad Thai TakeOut for lunch at least once a week for the last few months. Ive tried, Archies, Pin Know and a few others. Today I gave Surongs a shot and I was SO impressed. The portion size was HUGE! I still have enough for dinner leftovers. The noodles weren't over cooked and sticky like other places. I ordered a 7 spicy which was the perfect amount of kick. The order also came out piping HOT, which is unusual for take out. They were also very fast. I ordered over the phone and they had it ready in 8 minutes.   The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was the noodles were kind of oily and they charge a $.50 fee for card purchases below $15. My chicken pad thai came to $9.10 including the fee."}
{"text":"Great shrimp Thai green curry! Nice flavor and the sauce isn't too thick or thin...perfect consistency. Just wish they'd add more veggies and shrimp ... Too much sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was happy with their lunch special. The lunch came with tofu soup, crab rangoon and a fried wonton. Portions were nice and food wasn't too greasy or salty. Service was good and staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I love there food, cashew chicken is the boom.. Good food and a great price.."}
{"text":"This was the second time here the first time was almost perfect.       This time it was not as good.  pad thai was too sweet for me.       Chicken pineapple curry the star the last time was too thin and also sweet.          Spicy eggplant with tofu was spot on very good.         Beef massaman was pretty good , medium thick sauce nice peanut flavor , nice chunks of potato and beef.        Service was fine."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area been here like 3 times had Pad Thai, spicy basil and red curry all three dishes were  delish . Lunch specials rule."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best thai food! Love them! Best service and always a smile when you walk in!"}
{"text":"So I went here and decided to get spicy basil chicken and it was very good but the one complain I do have is that my food was too oily but other then that, the food is good."}
{"text":"WOW!  I have found my new fav Thai place in the city.  This place just opened down the street from me, and I couldn't wait to try it (I'm a huge Thai food fan). My hubbie and I went in for lunch, intending to try the $6.95 lunch special, but opted for the a la carte menu as it looked so good, and wasn't much more expensive.  I had the Pad Kea Mow with chicken and my hubbie had the Pad Prik King with pork. Both dishes were amazing. Great flavors, fresh crunchy veggies, fresh herbs - it was perfect. We asked for it hot, and it didn't disappoint. It was an eye watering, nose running, ear ringing burn, and I loved every second of it! Be warned, don't ask for hot unless you truly love it hot, as you will get it.   Tap water was filtered and good, nice hot teas (we had green and jasmine, both were excellent).  Good service, clean. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is good with reasonable prices.  I enjoyed their coconut ice cream, too.  There was only 1 server the evening we were there and she was great.    I'll defnitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad thai w chicken and beef jerky to go.   Both were amazing!!!  Service was quick and server was polite and inviting.  Everything looked very clean and I am looking forward to coming back and eating into enjoy with some drinks.  Very close to our home so we are within delivery range.   Yes!!!  Portions were large enough to have left overs and they were yummy too!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always prepared fresh and made to satisfaction. This is one of the best Thai food places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My sister takes me here often and every time, I'm pleasantly delighted by the amazing service and yummy dishes. This is my favorite Thai joint in Vegas! We got cashew chili beef, chicken massaman curry. I love their tom kha soup, so good. :)"}
{"text":"In love with their pineapple curry and Thai tea! Husband and I have tried quite a bit from their menu and we never have any complaints. It's super close and convenient. They're always quick and super friendly!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the lunch specials. Fried rice, pad thai, crab rangoon & some mixed veggie-meat entree. All really good. Prices are very reasonable also. Pretty good amount of serving also. Service was great. Will give 5 stars after a few more visits, make sure its consistent. If only their thai tea was bottomless, wouldve given them a perfect rating right away."}
{"text":"When I am in town for business, we eat here because the food is very reasonable, tasty and they have great lunch specials, which is why I recommend getting there early for lunch to get a table.  Most lunch specials are around $10 and they include soup with that.  One great thing is that they ask you to define your hot/spicy level from 1-10 so that it allows customers the ability to choose how hot they want their food, as Thai food can get very spicy.  The portions are extra generous and it is a great buy (and tasty too) for a quick lunch.  They will easily pull tables together for larger parties and have been very accommodating to us."}
{"text":"I ain't gonna lie, the service and food is excellent! had to take the menu home with me"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that when I have asked for dishes to be not spicy, they are still too spicy.  That works great for me, but not my 2 y/o. Still a nice place to stop in or for take out. Try the Tom Ka Gai soup, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is what makes me return frequently. Really hard to beat their healthy silver noodle soup. Prices are reasonable. I also like the calm and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have lived over near Surang's for about a year and it was always a treat eating here. A couple months ago I moved to Green Valley and I will still gladly make the drive over to Surang's for their pad thai. My favorite Thai food place in the city!"}
{"text":"A smidge of a downgrade here. I was sick, lazy and wanted some spicy food. As Surang's is nearby, and Thai Style Noodle House's on-line menu is nearly indecipherable, I opted to order Surang's \"chef specialty\" of Chinese broccoli and crispy pork ($9.95) and an order of yellow curry with tofu ($7.95).   While ordering, I asked if my address was in their free delivery range. I was assured that it was (and it is). My bill, upon delivery, however, was $22.00! Now, I know it's \"just\" a few dollars, but I found it kind of shady ($9.95+7.95+tax does not equal a round $22.00). At least tell me you're tacking on the delivery fee when I'm ordering!   The food, however, was fantastic, so I'm not totally turned off. The Chinese broccoli and crispy pork is my new, favorite Surang's dish. Sooo good and flavorful. But, if you like it hot, I'd suggest ordering at least a nine or ten. I ordered an eight and barely felt a sting.   I'll probably return...but likely not for delivery."}
{"text":"Great service. Clean place. Great vegetarian selection. Food is enjoyable. Convenient location."}
{"text":"We love this place they have very good Thai food we would definitely come back. Our favorite is Pad Thai and Tum Yum Soup."}
{"text":"I've been here over and over again.the food is always delicious and the service is great...I tip well so maybe you 2$-5$ tippers might not get the sand"}
{"text":"2 of us for dinner on a Saturday night, it was very quite inside this strip mall location. The waiter/cashier mis-understood our order, and we did not get one of our dishes. I missed out trying the Pad Thai, that could have swayed my experience. Also, I kept hearing the microwave oven turning on throught the kitchen. Not o good sound! I will not be back. Meh meh meh"}
{"text":"Decent thai food. I liked the pad see ew and the pad thai. Not the best thai food but it will do. If you feel like thai food and you want it fast this is where you should go."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good overall; it was fresh, had fairly good flavor, the zucchini included in the spicy basil entree was a pleasant change since this entree rarely has any vegetables included with it however this was also a way for them to reduce the amount of meat provided (I am not a big meat eater and it was even a very light portion of meat for me). As usual they provide an unnecessary amount of rice compared to the entree size.  Note: the Crab Rangoons are really Krab Rangoons because they don't use real crab.  I didn't care for the $15 minimum spend requirement to use a credit card without incurring a charge. In conclusion it is a likely possibility if I were in the area I may return since I almost always carry cash."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from my house. Holy closeness, batman. I've been a Archi's loyalist for sometime so it took me awhile to try Surang's. By golly! It's good, real good. I love their spicy eggplant and their pad thai is some of the best around, only second to Archi's. If you like heat, ask for an 8 or higher. Service is friendly when dining in and if you live/work in the area take out couldn't be easier. Delivery is also available with a minimum order."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves delicious Thai food , my family and I have we been coming here for at least 4 years and the food is consistently great"}
{"text":"Quick, delicious & authentic. I ordered the ginger chicken. Lots of meat & vegetables were fresh."}
{"text":"Surang's Thai kitchen. Authentic Thai restaurant clean and very welcoming with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Years and years later, this is still my go-to Thai place. While there are some better spots in town, I love Surang for the consistency, the great service, and the decent prices. They're quick and friendly and my order is always exactly how I want it!"}
{"text":"Was excited to eat Thai with some friends. The area is really nice and safe and lots of parking spots. We walked in and our hostess was extremely hospitable and welcomed us in. Didn't have to wait at all. Their lunch prices are extremely reasonable. One of my friends had been here before and said the food was wonderful. And we didn't have to wait long for the food to come! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered both red and yellow curry. Too soupy/watery for me and felt it could stand more flavor. Wasn't terrible, but I don't see myself returning any time soon for it."}
{"text":"ooooo weee!!! thats spicy!!!  Ok. I have been to many Thai restaurants in Vegas and so far Surang's Thai Kitchen became top of the list. I am even more happy that this is right down the street from me - Score! They even deliver!!   I was thinking what would be good for dinner for the familia and I.  I did not dine in. Ordered to go - that way I can eat in my pj's! (:  Ambiance was small and cozy. The staff were sweet and friendly.  I skimmed through the prices to see how much they are going to rob me for some din din. Surprisingly, there prices are reasonable! Everything on the menu was nothing more than $10. Double score!   I ordered the Beef Pad See-Ew and Spicy Basil (chicken) and they asked me HOW SPICY?? I told them that I've been to other Thai places and would do #10 because theirs wasn't that spicy. She then looks at me like I'm crazy. They asked me again with this look \"so 10?\" I hesitated, thinking maybe this place is no joke. So i went for an 8. OHHH MYYY GAHHH!!! I am so glad I did not say 10. LOL. My mouth was on fiyyaaahh!! But it was sooo gooood!!! so flavorful!!! so..so...Surangy!!!?! haha I just made that up.   Surang's Thai Kitchen is definitely a hit! I'm going to be there regular.. but for next time I know NOT to choose past 8 on spice level xD"}
{"text":"Best Thai food around this neighborhood... Strongly recommended.... Two thumps up!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the food did taste good but I met a friend there for lunch yesterday - my son, my friend and I all ended up with food poisoning. Not certain if it was from the basil chicken that we both ordered or if it was the soup that accompanied the lunch special. My 9 month old son had symptoms first, very loose stool that leaked out off his diaper all over the place shortly after we got home, I began feeling sick late last night as did my friend and she's still feeling very ill today.  Not certain what the culprit was as we both ordered the same thing but definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone and will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I just ate here with my sister. She recommended this Thai restaurant. The server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We ordered shrimp rolls, chicken panang curry, and fried pork with Chinese broccoli. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh.  The price was reasonable as well. I shall return. Thanks sis for picking the restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"I found this place a year ago & I have never had any problems with eating here. If I'm ever in the mood for Thai food, I usually come here. Their Thai tea is good as well as their customer service & their lunch specials are always a plus."}
{"text":"The Tom ka soup was excellent, A large order was too much for the two of us,. Basil rice was just perfect and we enjoyed it along with the, papaya salad, We were do full that we had to make the sticky rice dessert to go. Overall a good experience for vegetarians and friendly service."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed, since I used to really like this restaurant. We ordered take-out recently (Cashew chili w/ chicken, Thai beef jerky, chow mein w/ shrimp, spring rolls, and mixed vegetables) & the quality and freshness of the foods were inferior! The chow mein noodles were so over-cooked that it was mushy! The beef jerky pieces had a ton of visible fats on them (gross!). The mixed veggie barely had any vegetables, since it was overshadowed by pieces of fried tofu (annoying!). The ONLY delicious item were the spring rolls. We won't be ordering from Surang again, since we don't want to spend our hard-earned money on low-quality foods."}
{"text":"Blahhhhhh...  What is wrong with people on yelp? This place was sooo mediocre. I seriously don't think it deserves 4.5 starts. I went in and expected it to be almost amazing but ended up regretting it because it was not worth the far drive from my hotel.   I'm not gonna go into what I ordered because it's just not worth my time. I wrote this review to warn other people of blahhh food."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food spot I found so far! The portions are good and are satisfying!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant! The menu is bomb and the people are really friendly. I get the same thing every single time and I love it. I swear I come here 3 times a week. Bring your family here!"}
{"text":"I can't let this one slide.  Hubby picked up take out from this place. Still havent found a good Thai place in Vegas and I'm skeptical every time I try a new spot so we always start off with the basic dishes. He ordered the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. I mean you could never go wrong with the two, at least that's what I've always thought until now. The two dishes were unpleasant and annoying to taste each bite. My 10 year old son even said he can probably make it better.  They were both dry and lacked flavor. The pad thai tasted off.  The pad see ew was just oily and yuuckk.  Sorry to even have to write this.  What's even more annoying is the service. They charge a $1 fee for any credit card charges under $15. LMFAO! How ridiculous is that?! They don't make money on their service so they have to find other means to make money of their paying customers. I'm surprise their bathroom doesn't have a coin deposit.   So my husband asks for some peanut sauce and the lady wants to charge him $1 for a half filled 8 oz container. Do the math. Poor management. Then again it's Vegas! Where can you find decent service and yummy food off the strip?  1 star because I need to remind myself just because it's down the street and convenient doesn't mean it's good."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I have definitely experienced better.  This is a very casual place which is fine.  But the food is only ok, depending on what you order. Avoid the gristle, erh, beef soup. The spicy eggplant with beef is one of their best dishes.   It is kind of a hit and miss place as far as the dishes good.  When it is good, it is good and when not - one wonders what went so wrong."}
{"text":"First time coming here, super nice service and the food was delicious. I ordered sweet and sour chicken and it was good size portion and I also did A side order of Crab Rangoon. So Good! Sorry no photo with this one, I couldn't wait to dig in."}
{"text":"We were near Exit 20, looking for a new place to eat. Decided on Thai and Surang's popped up. It was early in the afternoon. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Family/kid friendly. Authentic thai restaurant. We ordered Pad Thai & Pad Kee Mao. Also very friendly staff who were very attentive and greeted us right away. Would definitely recommend! Will be back, thanks!"}
{"text":"Review time, as I've visited this establishment several times now, yet today's experience merits a written commentary.  I'll begin by stating that I've never been at all disappointed with the quality of food.  Always fresh ingredients and tasty dishes.  In fact, I had planned on giving them a 4 star review several times now, but never got around to it.  Unfortunately, that extra star fell off today.  Our regular lunch party of 4 was in attendance, and we all love Thai food.  Each of us ordered something different from the menu, and all 4 meals, although not all lunch specials, were accompanied by a complementary cup of soup.  The broth was lukewarm, and the centers of the tofu pieces were still cold.  Not very appetizing.  The meals came...and I can't understand why in some restaurants the cooks can't plate the meals to be delivered together.  2 of the dishes came out a good 5 minutes before the other 2.  Thankfully, we're all casual enough to discard table mannerisms and begin eating before everyone is served.  This may have been awkward in a business luncheon or dinner with other acquaintances.  The 3 who ordered lunch specials all commented on how the food was fine, but the plates were ice cold, which cooled the dish down significantly before they were 1/2 way through.  I ordered larb salad, which was delicious, but the ground meat was also barely warm.  As if they cooked it, then used refrigerated sauce.  I know it's not supposed to be a hot dish, but the contrast in temperatures between the ground seasoned meat and sauce, vs. the cold crisp lettuce or cabbage, makes the dish so much more enjoyable.  Again, tasty, but leaving me someone dissatisfied.  Overall, service was as expected, flavors were above average, but little things like timing and temperature deducted from the score.  There are at least 3 other Thai restaurants within the mile or 2 radius that get that extra star, and likely our future business."}
{"text":"Love Surangs! Been coming here for years and the food and service is always good. The pricing is very decent also. Looking for a good Thai restaruant in the South West, give Surangs a try. I think you won't leave disappointed and may even become a repeat customer.."}
{"text":"First time here and wanted to try their Papaya salad but  was sad ...very soggy with no crunch to it . I couldn't take another bite . That was a waste of money!  And the panang curry was served warm to cold ...didn't enjoy my dinner but my husband did enjoy his pad Thai though. Service was good but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Best that food in thr southwest area..if you like noodles..they have the best pad seaew and the fried wonton is yummy!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Food was delicious, we had fried won tons & beef jerk for appetizers (serving size was perfect) Shrimp fried rice, and Tom Yum soup was so flavorful and plenty for two to share. Will definitiely return,  customer service was great!"}
{"text":"BF works nearby, found through the Yelp app to order delivery- arrived in a timely manner, ordered the fish cakes and tom kha soup, $22 with delivery fee.  Fishcakes were fine, might even say good. Tom kha was watery instead of creamy. Soup tasted like spicy water.  Afterward, got sick. I'll assume it was the \"soup\".  Not going to bother giving this place another try, too many other Thai places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food quality here is amazing, not a huge place nothing fancy but nice and clean. Better yet the service was the best I felt like are severe was some sort of Jedi mind reader didn't have to ask for anything she just knew will be back soon."}
{"text":"Located at west fort apache near Walmart. The restaurant unassuming once you get into the restaurant the ambiance is simple and very nice. The menu is simple and the pricing is quite reasonable. Home cooked thai food is the best description that I can think of."}
{"text":"Omg I think I finally found a place comparable to Lucki Thai which is too far away now :( We came in around 6pm? and were the only customers in there for like 40 minutes but then tables were filling up quickly. It is a tiny restaurant and it appears there were only 2 people working but we did not wait long for our food. We ordered a silver noodle salad, yellow curry w/ chicken, thai tea & coconut ice cream & sticky rice. The salad was really really spicy and I didn't realize it came with shrimp so I ate around those. The curry was good and pretty big portion. But the coconut ice cream and sticky rice was out of this world!!! Our server was attentive even though she was doing multiple jobs! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best thai in our area, and they deliver. We usually order the spring rolls, larb salad, and a curry. Delivery is timely, usually arrives a little before estimated time."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, they gave me great service, the restaurant is nice cozy little place to eat, I definitely enjoyed the food is good will be back for more in the near future"}
{"text":"I had celebrated my birthday here with my family, we were totally of 13 in the group.  I had called earlier in the day to make the dinner reservation and we were accommodated easily.   The prices were great for a large party under a budget.  The food came out, our party ordered different dishes and I liked mine (Peppered Steak).  Mine was beef and cooked perfectly , very tender.  Everyone liked their food very much, service was great (even though there was only 1 server), the mango with sticky rice got praises.  The only thing that I noticed that needs a little bit of improvement was the temperature of the food.  The rice were not steaming hot and so the other dishes when it came out and served to us.  None of my party noticed it as we were all chatting away while waiting.  But I did noticed it, as I'm very observant one and the foodie in the group.  But I will definitely come back here again when in the area.  I had chosen this place as it was closer to my relatives who lives in the Enterprise area."}
{"text":"In town from ATL for my 35th Bday and this place was highly recommended by the host of the Airbnb we are staying at......... absolutely perfect. The atmosphere is calm and clean. The food was outstanding. Might make it back here before we go!"}
{"text":"So used to visiting the popular Thai restaurants in Vegas. What a treat this was.  Awesome food and genuinely friendly service. Chichen Satay was perfectly juicy. Shrimp cakes actually had shrimp in them and where freshly crisp. Tom kha soup had just the right amount of sweetness to counter the spicy. And finally the pad won sen silver noodels with ground chicken completed the meal.  Will be comming back time & time again."}
{"text":"I was impressed by how quickly Surang's delivered my order to me. It was accurate and the food was pipping hot when it arrived. I have always been a fan of their curries and now it's nice to know the convenience of ordering delivery from them."}
{"text":"Born n' raised in LV (so what guy, this is about Thai cuisine, unrelated)...perhaps...but frequenting this Cuisine all over Nevada, Surang's hands down/no question about it...'the Best Thai food in Vegas.'  Winners of the Best of Las Vegas, this little joint up on Ft. Apache delivers sensational dinner treats.  Highly recommend the Fried Rice (not the ordinary kind ya)...the Crab Fried Rice.... Pad Thai & Panong Curry dishes also exceptional.  Hit it up, you'll be glad u did (& will be joining in on the reviews, watch)."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some delicious Thai food. I had the kung pow chicken. Awesome flavor and spicy 5 was perfect."}
{"text":"My father introduced me to this place. He often orders the fried tofu, pork jerky, and the lunch special mixed vegetable with beef. I am a fan of Thai food. My favorite is the lunch special spicy basil with ground beef and a fried egg on the side. From the moment I stepped foot in this restaurant, I was greeted with a friendly smile and over the top service. The price fits the portions and for me it is comfort food."}
{"text":"This is a great location! Easy to find  and friendly service! Love the padi thai and thai tea here, I always go with the vegetable! the crab rangoons are alsk really great! they ket you pick your spice level for each dish as well froma scale of 1-10 ehich is great:)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem amongst the crowd. Well worth trying it if you haven't already. I had the Yellow Chicken Curry with Seafood Soup."}
{"text":"My favorite place, great food fast service and next to my office!!  Conveniently located right off Russell on Ft Apache!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food has so much flavor. Love the curry fried rice, country curry it's the best and beef salad yummy."}
{"text":"I love thai food, so this review compared Surang Thai Chicken to my two favorite local thai spots, Lotus of Siam and Le Thai downtown.  I think this is a great option for a solid thai dinner that offers home delivery.  The green curry had a little too much butter, but the fried rice was great. My friend got the pad thai and said it was okay, but not his favorite. Bottom line is that this should be the go-to thai delivery option for those of us in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Thai food. Super nice people and great service. Had the pad woon sen and pad pet. Both delicious. This lil neighborhood joint deserves the great reviews it has."}
{"text":"Came for duck noodle soup but I was disappointed they didn't have it... Food was ok,  server was nice.. free Thai tea with check in and review.."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best food. I tried the beef and broccoli and it was amazing. I would rate them a 10/10."}
{"text":"This is one of the best thai places in Las Vegas. I was actually skeptical when i stepped into the restaurant.But they surprised me with awesome food. The portions are pretty big compared to other thai joints. I wished that restaurant.com was still selling their gift certificates."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! Definitely a must try.  I highly reccommend the Thai tea! Pad Thai is really good. My daughter is a picky eater, and they accommodated her."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai tastes the way it should, not too sweet, really authentic. Great choice for Thai food!"}
{"text":"The food is here good and people are really nice! Everyone should try their pad thai and thai tea! Visit it whenever you get the chance one of the good thai food places."}
{"text":"I was not super impressed with this place. The food was okay, the service was slow, and a little forgetful. Oh, and one of us got a hair in their soup. So there was that.   About the hair. it happens, I get it. However, the \"handling\" (or lack there of) was not great. They removed the soup right away and brought another soup. They did not take anything off his bill, or send the manager over to apologize, nada. So I didn't feel that was a superb way to handle it.  I enjoyed my Chicken Tom Kah soup, although a bit too much lemongrass which caused the soup to be a bit sour and unbalanced.   Everything was brought out at difference times, but still rather quickly. My experience may have been a bit unusual since this place has relatively high ratings, so go ahead and give it a shot if you must, but there are a lot of other thai places in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Vegas!  All the employees are very nice and helpful.  Prices are decent and food is yummy.  We've done delivery once and it came very quickly.  I'm able to get a zero spice level on mine (since I share it with the three year old) and my husband can get a 6 (which is enough to make his eyes water).  Great flavors."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the restaurant before and the food was decent. I decided to get delivery from them. What can I say very very disappointed! First time, I ordered I asked everything to be a 10. Yes I love spicy food. It was maybe a 5. I ordered delivery again and told them I wanted it spicier then a 10...what did I get? I got a 0. No spice in anything. Bland central! The girl on the phone said she was going to pack extra chili sauce and there was none...all the food was a 0 on the spice level. Very very disappointed. I guess I will be going back to Thai Noodle House down the street from them where they do make it spicy when u request it."}
{"text":"My first time here and I am not disappointed! It's very delicious!! The pad Thai has so much flavor and I'm a huge Thai tea lover which was AMAZING!! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the pepper steak for dinner and it was pretty bad. The meat quality was poor but the veggies and rice were good. Probably won't order meat again but would consider some of their veggie entrees. I was pretty disappointed overall"}
{"text":"Great option for Thai in the southwest. Came because of positive yelp reviews. Definitely a good choice.   Go to items: panang curry, papaya salad, pad Thai, pad see ewe.   The spice level here isn't too bad so order hotter if you like it spicy. Quick delivery too!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars but my rice came out cold.. My server immediately heated it up, apologized and explained that there was a problem with the electrical input the rice pot was hooked up to.. No biggie ;P.   Besides that, everything was AWESOME. I loved the big roomie chairs in the dining room. Por was an excellent server, she asked me if I had any questions and explained the dishes to me very well. I felt like she cared about my dining experience there and was very friendly and personable.  The passion fruit tea was good, and the Thai fresh rolls were amazing! Especially the sauce that came with it.  I ordered the chef's special- Chinese broccoli with crispy pork at level 4 spicy. The pork skin was perfectly crispy and the broccoli had a nice crunchiness. I loved how the dish got spicier with every bite I took, like a surprise in every bite!  I will definitely be coming back for some awesome Thai food. Great service, great food, and very reasonable prices. I'm even going to eat the leftovers I brought back today for dinner tonight! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This my most favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Me and my family always come here when we are craving Thai food~ if I say yes all the time, my kids want to come everyday :) when I ask for my family what they want for dinner, Surang is the first place they want to go out for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and they were busy but we got seated fast. They have lunch special with a lot of items to choose from. Chicken pad Thai and pepper steak was great!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, only complaint was the poor choice in music. The were playing what sounded like a 9 year old singing the best of 2014 and all the songs sounded the same. Totally ruined the vibe, but I heard they deliver so might try that next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I tried their beef pad thai and the chicken yellow curry and both were delicious! Definitely recommend this place. I will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I finally found a place for this food that's excellent!!!! Staff friendly and service pretty quick. Been here a few times and it's always good."}
{"text":"I love going here and ordering their papaya salad and pad kea mow. This has to be the best Thai place ever and they have some legit Thai tea. Kudos to the owner!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. the chicken cashew is good! The Tom Ka Kai soup is ok.. could be better... but the Thai iced tea is excellent!"}
{"text":"I took a trip to Thailand a few months ago and the second I came back I had to go get some surang's. The quality is superb and reminded me of having food on the streets of Bangkok. Great staff. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant 2 times.  Both times the experience was great, but the food on the 1st visit seemed so much better than the 2nd visit.  Both times we had the Chicken Pad Thai 0 spice and Green Curry Spice 2 and it was good.  We also had the crab rangoon, which was really good!  On our 1st visit, we ordered the sweet and sour chicken for our 3rd item.  It was different, not what we were expecting.  On our 2nd visit, we ordered the chinese broccoli and crispy pork.  This dish was ok, nothing too exciting, lots of broccoli."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from grub hub. The pad thai was mushy and sweet. The Mongolian beef was hard and chewy. Lastly their fried rice was flavorless and oily. I didn't think anyone could mess up fried rice. Definitely a waste of money."}
{"text":"Parents just moved to vegas and we were looking for great Thai food. Amazing thai tea! Great service! Yummy pad thai!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Surang's Thai Kitchen. I had the chicken penang. It came with one piece of red pepper and two pieces of  green pepper. The food was very salty and I had a dump a whole bowl of rice on it to eat it.The waitress was rude, not friendly, and did not come to check on us, or give us the spice rack. If you are a Thai customer, you will get special treatment, a spice rack, and the waitress will check upon you. Very racist establishment here that gives preference to Thai  customers. I was never asked how the food was, or a thank you for paying my bill. I can read what the bill says, you don't have to point to the bill with your fingers to tell me. I have a college degree, I know how to read a bill. Don't waste your time and money here. There are better choices in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant a try based on the reviews I read.  I got pad thai, soup, thai beef salad, and a pork salad.  Price was reasonable, salads were good but a little overdressed.  I thought the flavors were great.   I would eat here again, but still partial to an old favorite thai place which out of respect I won't mention.  Surangs will not let you down for a good thai meal - give it a try. Friendly staff also!"}
{"text":"Adequate... that's all I can say about this meal and service. It was our first time eating here and our last. To start, service was SLOW and there was only 1 other family dining. I asked for peanut sauce with my egg roll. I was given plum sauce and the woman said they were out of peanut sauce. 5 minutes later, our chicken satay arrives and guess what... low and behold, there was peanut sauce... I stated, I thought you were out of peanut sauce. I caught her off guard and she came back with \"this was the last of the peanut sauce.\" Maybe they were but I found it odd.   Ok then for my wife's bowl of chicken soup. There was cleaning agent on the rim of the bowl. So at least they are cleaning the dishes, just not rinsing it.  Bottom line, eat at your own risk. I would rather eat at Thai Noodle house 2 or Panni. Great and friendly staff at Noodle House 2 and great peanut sauce at Panni.  2 hour update: My Son is now experiencing stomach cramps and has made 2 trips to the restroom. He ordered Pad Thai with extra chicken.  Not going to be be a good night! I should probably change my 2 stars to 1 but the Mango Iced Tea was good."}
{"text":"My 1st time in here & I love it so much !!  for sure I will be a customer for life !!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since I found this a gem during my last trip to Vegas. On my last trip in August of last year I relied on Yelp to help me find a great Thai restaurant here in Vegas. As usual, Yelp did not let me down. If you are a frequent Yelper you know that it is rare to find a restaurant with a 4.5 star rating with a significant number of reviews. As soon as I saw that Surang's managed to accomplish this rare feat I knew I was in for a great meal. Surang's is  a good distance from the strip but it is definitely worth the drive. It seems to be in a decent part of town also, so no need to worry about your safety while roaming away from the strip.   We ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Yellow Chicken Curry (my absolute favorite Thai dish), Orange Chicken, Broccoli Chicken,and Spring Rolls. Every single item was great. We loved the food and ate until we were all stuffed. The owners and servers were very nice and it appears to be a family run operation which is a plus to me. The place was very modern and very clean as well. Not really a fancy place and it is more suited for a family meal than a romantic dinner. It wasn't the cheapest Thai restaurant I have been to and it wasn't the most expensive either. I think it is fairly priced and a great value when you factor in the quality of the meal.   So you may be wondering what took me so long to write a review. Well i am back in Vegas and had to look up the location of this place so we can go later today. I figured since I was back on the page and enjoyed the food so much that I owed Surang a review. Since it has been a year, I promise to come back with an update to confirm if this place is holding the quality that I expect."}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers, I favor this place for my Thai food fix over Archis.  Our waitress was very friendly, but lacked a bit on the service. She was the only one there and there was another big party that had arrived a few minutes before us. So, I gave her some slack. But, maybe the establishment should ensure having more than one waitress around, especially during dinner time.   I had the curry fried rice, something I hadn't tried before. I liked it as it was flavorful and had lots of the chicken in it. Most places I get fried rice, only have small bits and pieces of meat here and there. The rest of the table ordered Beef Pad See Ewe and Pineapple curry. Both were good. The pad see ewe wasn't at all oily, a problem I run into at other restaurants. The flavor of the curry was good as well, but I was a bit disappointed as the only thing that made it a pineapple curry was a handful of pineapple fruit tossed it. But, the actually curry itself was great, so no biggie.   It's a small place, so it might not be great for big parties. But a great place for a small gathering. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Quick service and friendly staff.  The peanut sauce is highly recommended, very good!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to this side of town so I'm really eager to try out the different local joints here. I Had lunch here this evening with my girlfriend and as usual we ordered a lot of food. Chicken skewers were good. Papaya salad we asked for loas style and it was wayyy too salty we gave it back to redo and it was even worse they must've mistaken the sugar for salt. I never had a bad panang Thai but this one was lacking flavor. Pad Thai lunch combo was mehh & the side of fried wonton & Rangoon was cold! Service was ok For the price and the quality of food I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My go to Thai resto. I always get the Ala cart Pad thai noodles and Basil Chicken. If I don't feel like cooking I always call in to pick up and in 10 minutes Im there and the food is ready. Their service is great too."}
{"text":"Very nice people. They said delivery would be 45 mins and it arrived in 15 mins. I got the red curry spice 0 and it a watery mess. We also got the Tom las soup and it was literally the same consistency. Almost no flavor in the curry and the soup is ok. I don't know if getting spicy 0 caused this but I've never had it be an issue at other Thai places before."}
{"text":"First time I've been here and it was amazing. I'm from Hawaii and the prices here are great. We came in on a Sunday night and there was no wait at all. The Thai tea was amazing! We ordered the red curry (amazing), green curry (amazing), pad Thai (amazing), pad see-ew (amazing), and the fried rice (amazing). I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I order lunch from here often. The food is always great, the service is friendly, and the price is affordable. I love the curry and the chicken pad see ew"}
{"text":"Good food and Fast delivery. They do make the food on the spicy side so ask for no more than a level 3. Will order again :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken fried rice I've found in Las Vegas. The chicken actually has flavor!   The first visit wasn't ideal because I called to place an order during the lunch rush hour and was placed on hold for over 5 min. I decided to hang up and just go and place an order in person. When I got there the restaurant was full and there was only one server, so naturally I felt bad for the employee as she was being pulled all over the place. I ordered the yellow curry, pad Thai, and fried rice. The other two dishes were alright but the fried rice really stood out.   Tonight I went back, please Was able to place an reorder over the phone ahead of time with no issues. Will be making this a new regular spot."}
{"text":"I really liked this place before, but it seems as though they haven't been on their game lately.  Not as much meat in their items as I've gotten in the past.  Also, the last couple of times I've called orders in for pick up, I've been given chicken instead of beef.  Get it together Surang!  I have closer Thai options, but have always been loyal to you.  I guess I'm going to give some of the other Thai spots a shot...maybe I'll be back, maybe I won't?"}
{"text":"We wanted to catch a bite on our way out of town, and found Surang's Thai restaurant nearby. Reviews are spot on! Nice little place with really good food.  We always get yellow curry, and this one did not disappoint! We tried the crispy pork and it was delicious! Complete with a Thai ice tea and a Thai coffee. Yum! Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai and Spicy Basil.  I love good Thai and this is good!"}
{"text":"Yummy. There is no better way to end a record hot Vegas day then eating some good spicy Thai curry. It's a nice place to eat, not fancy but clean and a good environment, playing some California dreaming.   Ordered a few dishes one to eat there and a couple to go. First up Panang Curry with pork at level 5 spiciness medium heat. Really tasty dish only thing i didn't like about it was the green beans weren't cooked enough. Picked out and ate all of the green beans first and enjoyed the rest. The sauce thick, creamy, and full of the right amount of heat for me. $7.95   The Masaman Curry with chicken was next. The sauce wasn't as thick as the Panang Curry and maybe a bit too watery for me, but there was no under cooked green beans to pick out. Everything about this dish was delightful to me except that I was already full and just sampling the rest. $7.95   The Basil Crispy Pork was last. Really liked the crispy pork pieces, fatty and tender meat with crunchy skin. The sauce was also tasty. $9.95   Their lunch special is a pretty good deal. Starting at $6.95 they have 12 different dishes from pad Thai to curry or noodles, each served with soup, fried egg roll, and fried wonton.   Drinks aren't refillable except for the regular ice tea @ $1.50. There's other flavored ice teas or Thai iced coffee for $2.50-$3.00.   My server was real nice and friendly and was always checking on me, not too much to be bothering, but enough to feel welcomed and important. I was glad that she brought me a peppermint candy at the end because my mouth was heating up."}
{"text":"The food here is great! You can find a standard selection of Thai dishes along with some chef's specialties like shrimp choo chee and crispy pork. They do they basics like pad thai extremely well, too. I have never been disappointed with an item on the menu. I'm told by the staff that they make their own red curry paste from scratch here, as well.  The restaurant offers a small dining area, and also you can order for takeout. The restaurant seating area is very simple and practical -- definitely hole-in-the-wall feel. Takeout orders are usually ready within 15 minutes and always have been hot and fresh. The one time that I was given the wrong takeout order and drove away with it, the restaurant actually contacted *me* before I got home and I returned to have it fixed, no problem."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant that's always consistent with great eats. I've stopped in here a handful of times and I've never left disappointed. My favorites are the green and yellow curry, basil fried rice and their various noodle dishes. They have a very extensive menu with many vegetarian options for those interested. Today my friend and I had the chicken basil fried rice and the tofu pad see ew. Both dishes were very flavorful and the spice levels were just as we had requested....spicy!! They have beer and wine on the menu. Prices are very reasonable. My friend and I paid no more then $10 for each dish and we both had leftovers. No wow factor here but a great overall restaurant with delicious food. I will continue to return here."}
{"text":"Best Tai joint in SW Vegas!!! Live the crispy pork. And the soups are to die for"}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai food place!  The best pad thai and thai tea!! I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant a few weeks ago & I tried the crispy seafood pancake with combination fried rice. The seafood pancake was pretty good but it had clam or mussel (not a fan of 'em) in it so I'll be sure to just order the shrimp. Can't forget about the Thai tea, it's super sweeeet! The restaurant is clean, quiet, & our waitress was sweet. I will be returning & ready to try different Thai dishes there. :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  The vegetables were fresh. I asked for some changes to the dish. The waitress was friendly. I can't wait to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"The beef jerky, country curry & of course the pad thai are amazing! & the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai in Las Vegas!! Pad see ew, Pad Thai and Massaman Curry are Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Good Service.  It was quiet when i stepped in with my colleagues. Clean Restaurant, seems very down to earth atmosphere. Ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp and Chicken. It tasted great.  Good Food Portions. I need to take a box.   Dont forget to order there Thai Ice Tea.  Will go there again to taste some other food item. i defiantly recommend.  4 stars only because this is not the best i have experienced."}
{"text":"Tried Surang's for the first time this evening, and boy was it good! We were on the hunt for something Asian, and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. We went in and say down, but ordered our stuff to go. While waiting, we ate edamame, pretty standard but they brought out soy sauce which seemed strange. But we tried and did it change my life. Second, at the recommendation of the server, we ordered the Thai beer also good. Our food came out quick enough that I didn't have time to finish my beer. I ordered the Pad Woon Sen combination plate at a level 4 spice. I think I could have handle one notch up. My fiancée hot the Green Chicken Curry at a level 6. He mentioned the the 6 was a little spicy, not heeding my warning from other Yelp reviewers. All in all, I can't wait to go back! Epically delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time there and the lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful. I ordered the chicken pad tai and it was delish. Now if I could just get sweet sticky rice I'd be happier."}
{"text":"Close to mother taste of Thai and it is taste good!! Best a pad Thai in town ever and cost effective. Attendant are super kind -- if you ask me go there again? Why not? Absolutely."}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai places we have been to. The Tom Yum soup hardly had anything in it. Honestly was like water with 3 pieces of chicken and I asked for extra chicken. Go to Thai noodle house down the road across from WalMart"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place their pad kea mow is delicious and I love how flavorful their dishes are. Thai tea is bomb and i think out of the Thai places I think this is by far my favorite!"}
{"text":"I went twice, based on the reviews. The first time I had pad Thai which was a 6.5 at best. Nothing special & very small portion for $10. The cashier/hostess/waitress had a very bad attitude & I was simply doing takeout. I shook it off & decided to try it again but dine in. I had the panang curry. Two things wrong with this: 1st she brought out a bowl of rice for the entire table to share, strike one. 2nd she brought the curry out on a plate so I had to scrape the little that I did have onto my shared portion of rice. On top of that the same hostess was walking around with the same stank attitude. Clearly, it's time for her to find another job. Oh & the curry was maybe a 5 at best. Save your money & skip the bad cashier & subpar food!"}
{"text":"I had to work work Saturday this weekend (don't get into IT), so I thought we'd try a new Thai place.  Surang's is small, but well lit and inviting.  We ordered the crab rangoon, tom kha (kai), red curry with beef, mixed vegetables with pork.  The Thai tea was huge, but lots if crushed ice.  Quite deceiving!  I needed a refill though because it was good.  It was lightly sweet and creamy, slightly watery, but that made it a little less filling and refreshing.  The crab rangoon was good, but I have had better.  There was lots of filling, and a lot of it was imitation crab, combined with the usual cream cheese, which made it unique.  The sweet and sour was pretty good.  The only complaint I had was that the shell was a little thin, giving it a \"candy\" sort of taste.  I prefer a thicker shell.  The red curry with beef was a little disappointing.  It was watery, which I prefer, but the taste was also a little bit watery.  We ordered it medium, which was a perfect heat level, but the flavor could have been a little more bold.  The cool thing was that the waitress wanted our feedback, and when I told her this, she said thank you, and next time they can make it better.  The mixed veggies with pork were a little bland as far as the sauce went, but the veggies were nice and fresh.  With a little chili powder on it, it really wasn't bad.  The pork was extremely well prepared; not at all greasy or salty, and very tender.  This was a nice side to the curry.    The tom kha kai was pretty decent.  There were a lot of spices and herbs, and nice mushrooms.  It also could have been a little more sour, and a little creamier, but I did enjoy it the most out of our meal.  I would recommend trying it.    Overall I enjoyed my visit to Surang's.  I think they do a good job trying to stay authentic.  They could use a bit more boldness in their food, in my opinion, but perhaps it is just right for the average customer."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious! We found them through UberEats and it is now our Go-To Thai delivery, who am I kidding it's our go to delivery place! I stopped in the other night as well and it has a nice, clean, quaint decor and tables to eat there...I'm sure we will be going in sometimes too! Be happy you just found a GEM!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The spices are just right. The ice cream is always delicious and he Thai tea is always just right. This place is close to home too so very convienent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Vegas. It is super authentic and you can taste every bit of flavor. I would recommend their pad Thai, my favorite! I enjoyed the ambiance"}
{"text":"I've been craving some Thai but more specifically coconut curry for about 6mo. I was not disappointed as their Red curry with chicken was exactly what I was hoping for and so creamy tasting with great flavor....I can't wait to order it again soon.   I also ordered Vegetable chow mean and I would say it was a bit bland. I put some curry sauce on it and it made it yummy. I'd skip this one next time!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I've been here a few times. I order the yellow curry with carrots and potatoes only, spicy. The curry is so thin and watery. No flavor. Definitely not spicy. The potatoes and carrots are also cut too big so they don't cook all the way through."}
{"text":"The chicken pad Thai is really good.. But they use their hands to add in the bean sprouts as well.  Hmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great tasting authentic Thai food , staff is friendly and courteous and the price is right,"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've had in quite a while. The Thai tea is great too. Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Average Thai food. I haven't had anything exceptional in my many visits. The lunch special is a good price during the week."}
{"text":"After getting hooked on drool-worthy comfort food Pad See Ew in Westwood and moving to Vegas, I needed a new place to get my fix. I tried 6 different restaurants around town unsatisfactorily before I found Surang's in 2011. My husband and I have been coming back on a regular basis ever since.  Unfortunately, due to our obsession with Pad see ew, the only other things we've had here are Pad Thai and Thai tea. There have been a few off nights, but I can say that overall, the quality, flavors, and presentation has been very consistent these past 6 years, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Great Thai Restaurant. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is just great. We go there all the time, or we order in. We travel to Thailand all the time so we are pretty spoiled picky eaters. The place is small an cozy. We just love it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual thai place nearby. Awesome customer service! Fast service. Not too much choices on lunch menu though.  Tried their pad thai before and I love it! Tried spicy basil today and it's also good!"}
{"text":"They do delivery! I love that I can seat at home on a rainy or lazy day and order from home. And their papaya salad and chicken satay is delicious! Most places their chicken satay is dry but at Surang's, it's perfectly cooked and moist. I was disappointed with chicken larb cause it's not authentic but rest was pretty good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm I frequent this place quite often and the food never disappoints! My favorite dishes are the pineapple curry and spicy eggplant. Their dishes are a bit more flavorful than Archi's, however the portions are smaller (which is why they lost a star). The price range is also about the same as Archi's and most other Thai restaurants in Vegas. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. All in all this is one of the better Thai places in Vegas, but the portion size fell short."}
{"text":"Had several dishes from here last night and they were real good. Crab Rangoon was a nice appetizer, but no real crab taste. Green curry with chicken was as good as any I've had (5 on spice scale)   Pad Thai was ok could have had a little more moisture   Pad lee mow was excellent. Crisp fresh vegetables. Stay away from the Basil Crispy Pork !!!!!! Maybe that was an off night for that dish."}
{"text":"The dining room is never particularly busy here, but they are always fulfilling a ton of to-go orders for their regulars. We've somehow ended up here after making big life decisions, e.g. finding a house, finding our wedding venue. Kind of an odd place to end up, but my husband and I like the quietness of the restaurant. Their Thai tea is strong for a non-coffee drinker like me and kept me up all night, but my brother really enjoyed it. My go-to dishes are the papaya salad, chicken pad thai and thai toasted (yummy appetizer). They can accommodate all different types of spiciness levels, so just let them know if you have a preference. Servers are always very hospitable and attentive, so nothing to ever really complain about. Parking is super easy in this large strip mall area that doesn't really have any other businesses attracting many people during dinnertime. I'm afraid this place may succumb to closure due to it's location, so if you are looking for a solid Thai option on the westside, look no further!"}
{"text":"Was very delicious. My pad Thai was a big serving  My husband's kung pow chicken was too salty. We should have sent it back.  Very nice server,  place was clean."}
{"text":"Good thai place. Thanks fellow yelpers for your reviews. It helped narrow it down since there are like 5 in the local area. Will definitely be going back. Pad thai could have been spicy but still was really good."}
{"text":"Never eaten at restaurant. Been ordering home delivery since July 2012. Ordered Pineapple Curry, OMG, Was out of this world, But anytime I ordered the pineapple curry again, it got watery and watery. I did not give up.  Ordered again today (1/10/13), unfortunately the curry was even more watery, no flavored at all..:-(  Going to give them another try soon and hoping for my first experience"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend after getting a $25 gift certificate from Restaurant.Com. It's a new restaurant, the grand opening sign was still up.  There weren't any customers in the restaurant, but that's probably because we got there the second they opened. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  We were told to sit wherever we want, which is always nice.   Since we had to spend $35 in order for our certificate to be valid, we splurged and ordered Thai Tea, Thai Coffee, Garlic Pepper Beef, Combination pad thai, panang curry, and thai egg rolls just for the two of us.   Everything came right away. The drinks tasted as they should, the egg rolls were tasty with the plum sauce, the garlic pepper beef was savory and had a very nice presentation surrounded by the broccoli. The panang curry was delish, I kept pouring it over my rice and pad thai! The pad thai was BOMB of course. I don't usually get combo pad thai since it's like 2 bucks more, so boy was it a treat!   We definitely didn't finish all our food, so we got some togo boxes. We didn't finish our drinks either and they gave us to go cups for them, which was awesome!  I'd definitely come back here. The people were very friendly and it's pretty close to where I live."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, staff and service. I would highly recommend if you looking for a quick Thai fix."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time because I'm visiting from LA and I couldn't resist coming back again for lunch! Nice, small restaurant but the food is big in flavor.  Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for tasty Thai food!"}
{"text":"Very good! The service was very good and fast. Very authentic! I would recommend the crag Rangoon and the pad Thai"}
{"text":"Take mom's old dining room and throw it in a strip mall restaurant--mom thrown in the back to cook--and that's what we have at Surang's.  Given that my parents aren't Thai, the parents of the girl serving the place (so I assume) cook in the back.  As long as I can hear a foreign language being yelled at from the back of the restaurant, I know the food will be good.  I love the seating here, being so cozy, and I love their menu.  Back home we have dried beef that is basically dried meat, like a thick jerky, then it's deep fried.  They do it at Surang's and it is darn good.  Salty, chewy, and served with fish sauce--mm mm mm.  Everything that we tried--from the fish to to typical Thai dishes--were all very good.  I will definitely be coming here for their good eats, but especially for the dried  beef appetizer."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. Decent sized portions. Bring cash because they charge like a $2 fee for credit cards under $11 or so. But other than that, really some of the best pad Thai I've ever had. Great staff and nice place. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night around 6pm, pritty empty so seating was easy! Waitress greeted us and was super friendly, whatever we needed was never a problem. She was very informational and always smiling. My all time favorite(s) is the Pad-see-ew & red curry! Omg they are mouth watering and always crave it. Since I moved back to Hawaii, I found no other Thai food place as good as Surang's! Every time I visit Vegas, this a the number one place I always want to go for dinner and lunch (atleast twice before I leave) highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Vegas. We drive across town just to eat here for the last 3 years and it's worth it every time . The food is fantastic and the server Tammy is always  very friendly and attentive to make sure our experience was enjoyable each and every time . Highly recommended and you will not regret it ."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pad Thai is awesome. The service is quick and they have good customer service!"}
{"text":"Everytime i come here the foods awesome. I usually do takeout and they are super fast and super friendly. I usually get a curry, pad Thai, and crab rations!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. They are always super fast and always add the extra sauce that I ask for! I love the chicken and broccoli but the beef and broccoli is also very yummy!"}
{"text":"Not only was this place amazing, it literally is behind my house. Awesome for me. Not really newsworthy for you.   It's a small little joint, probably fits about 40 people? Or maybe less. I don't know. It's just a small, cozy little joint. Doesn't get packed but there is always people there.   The service was excellent. Waitress was on point. Making sure to tend to our needs and always will a smile on her face.  Food was delightful. It made me so DELIGHTED. Because again, the food was delightful. Had the usual thai fare on there but there was one dish on there I had to try that I had never recognized before: CATFISH DELIGHT. And my first bite into this dish, I was truly delighted. (ENOUGH WITH THE DELIGHTS) Imagine morsels of catfish fillets fried and covered with a red curry paste accented with basil. The fillets didn't lose it's crunch.. A bit of it was taken away from the paste but there was the ever so slight crunch that made this dish perfect for me!!  The curry was typical to other thai curries I had but the Pad See Ew was bomb-tastic. We ordered extra egg on it, such a wise decision friends. They cooked the egg in water (like in egg drop soup) and sprinkled it on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. SO ONO!   I heard they have amazing lunch specials. So try those for me folks, and let me know how it goes. If it's anything like my dinner experience, then the lunch specials will be top notch!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! I was in the area, and anytime there's an opportunity to try a Thai place, I jump at that opportunity. This place did not disappoint.   I had a quick look at the lunch menu and at the very top, Pad Thai, listing its ingredients and right there first on the list was tamarind juice -- an ingredient missing a lot of times I think from the many of the so-called Pad Thai dishes here in Las Vegas. I just had to try it.   Again, very tasty. I think I found a top contender in my quest for a good authentic Pad Thai."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT ONLY  This place is very cute and small hole in the wall. The plaza that it is in i would have never thought that there was a resteraunt.  The cashier/server was super friendly and welcoming and they had really soothing cover songs playing by a certain artist.   I got a PAD THAI here which is one of my favorite dishes for a Thai place. It was good but was a little dry and i ordered a level 9 and it really didn't seem very spicy at all  Also ordered some sticky rice and it was not very good at all.... it was not very sticky and more on the dried out side...  One thing I loveee about this place is that they have AWSOME THAI TEA!! and they have the pickled SERRANO THAI CHILI which totally helped the pad thai reach a certain level of spice for me. Will have to come back and try other stuff maybe while dining instead of take out."}
{"text":"All the food is really good. I've been here a few times and always have to order like 10 dishes because I can't decide on one. I love the red and yellow curries mixed with the crab fried rice. Best flavor combo ever! I'm knocking off a star because I called tonight for delivery and they didn't have a driver. Not a big deal though, I don't mind going in since it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"I happened to be at this end of town, not near where I live and found this place on Yelp.  We had the lunch special, great price and good food. The portions were a little skimpy but nicely presented and served quickly. I would visit this restaurant again. Give them a chance. Friendly owner."}
{"text":"Here is an update about my take out experience with Surang's as opposed to our dine in experience.  What can I say? The service and food is consistent between dine in and take out!  I have a few friends that live literally down the street from Surang's and they talk about how good the other place down the street is good.  I was a bit hungry and I wanted to get a taste of Surang's so I naturally headed down to to order out some Yellow Curry with Chicken.  It took about five minutes for my three orders of Yellow Curry with Chicken to come out.  In the mean time, even though I was sitting down waiting for the order, they still brought us out water, which I thought was very nice.  I got back to my friends and it the food did not disappoint.  It was delicious!  I did get a number 3 (0-10 on the spicy-hotness scale) again and for some reason it was STILL making me sweat.   I think I'm losing my suave because I think next time for sure I'm going to ask for a 2."}
{"text":"All their food is delicious. Can't go wrong with any choices. Place is clean.....Staff is great! I really Love their Thai toast!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love this place. The Flavors oMG, Always fresh and desirable. They are on point!! You get the true Thai essence dining here! I'm def traveling there very soon and I may take up residence b/c of this place!!   I  am back at it again. Lovvvve this place! A must try in the south west!"}
{"text":"Been calling their number off their internet page, off of yelp, no answer, tried for 30 Mins. Could not order. Had to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for yellow curry with chicken- my usual place closed... glad I stopped by! Yellow curry can be iffy from place to place and this one was fabulous.  Now I have a new place for good curry and pad thai. Friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Quality Thai food.  I wouldn't say anything blew me away, but prices were reasonably, service was quick, and they deliver.  Spicy level 10 is a nice jolt as well and packs a nice punch without overwhelming the taste buds.  The lunch special is actually a very good portioned amount for less than $10 which comes with a main dish, protein, crab rangoon, soup (if dining in), rice, and fried wonton.  If you're in the area and like Thai food, give it a try for lunch especially."}
{"text":"Been here few times. Love their yellow curry. For its price of $9.95 it's really worth it in my opinion. Great little place for dinner at a decent price"}
{"text":"The roomie and I ordered delivery.. It was fast and yummy!!  Chicken yellow curry and fried Won Ton.  We will be ordered again, FOR SURE!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Staff are friendly. I have had Lunch, Dinner, To Go and Delivery from this place. I love the casual atmosphere. And they are Vegetarian Friendly! The taste of the food is consistent no matter what time of the day I place an order. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is relatively close to my apartment and I always order to go on most nights I decide not to cook. Their spice level is very attractive for someone that wants a nice authentic meal! I really enjoy their Thai tea the most. Noptanat is the best!!"}
{"text":"Review on PICK-UP!  We did a pick up since it was so close by to the pad. Ordered over the phone. Guy was nice.  Ordered panang chicken really mild. Don't like it to hot. It was really good. Beef Pad see ew was good but it wasn't like wow to me. It needed more sauce mixture. And last is Chinese broccoli with crispy pork. It was OK not how like LA makes their crispy pork. It didn't have the skin. It seemed just like a big thick bacon.  It's not bad here. They also deliver with a $15. Minimum   The nice thing is they give you rice for free. Not like other Thai places I go and do pick ups."}
{"text":"The portion sizes here are pretty big compared to other Thai restaurants, with a reasonable price. Service is good, food comes out quickly, and the menu has a lot of variety. We had the yellow curry, Tom Kha soup,  and beef fried rice. As a spice lover, I asked them to make the rice super spicy and they delivered! It's good for those who like mild food as well. For big eaters and those who like to have a lot of choice when eating out,  I would recommend this place amongst the myriad of Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best Thai food in Las Vegas, and they'll give you a free Thai tea if you write a review. Especially satisfying after a day of climbing in red rock."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant always fresh and good flavor. Fast service and friendly staff. Love the Tom yum soup and all the variety of entrees"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get your Thai food cravings! The workers are alway friendly and I go here so much they know my order! I always get the Panang curry, pad Thai noodles, pat see yu, beef larb, and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I haven't had their Thai food for a few years, so I decided to order take out from this place.  Never again!  They have now raised their price significantly and their yellow curry with chicken is now over $10.  What do you get?  Only about 5-6 pieces of chicken meat and 3 pieces of potato.  The rest is just liquid curry.  I expected the curry to be thicker with some substance to it, but it wasn't.  It was like watered down curry. Not at all what it should be like. It wasn't until I was about to throw away the styrofoam container that it came in that I saw that the container had deteriorated.  I think the curry sauce or liquid was actually eating away at the container.  They use very cheap containers and now I remember why I stopped coming here.  The curry I ordered last time was funny tasting because of the same issue.  The container had melted away into the curry sauce.  I remember bringing this issue up with them last time and obviously nothing was done about it.  NOT GOOD!!  Bottom line, don't order any curry to take out!!!"}
{"text":"NEXT TIME YOU WANNA CHARGE A PHONE ORDER 2 EXTRA DOLLARS FOR 5 EXTRA PIECES IF MUSHROOMS, LET ME KNOW IN ADVANCED. You never told me it was extra $$ for some mushrooms lol.  The girl on the phone wasn't the usual girl that works there and this girl gave me such attitude when I asked why my total came out the way it was.  ALSO good thing I checked the lid wasn't even on tight. I GOT SOUP lol.   Thanks for the small serving of extra mushrooms for 2$."}
{"text":"I found this place only OK, bordering on meh, I've had better. In all fairness, I am new to Thai food. However, I've Really really (100X really) enjoyed pan Asian and I found Panna Thai to be delicious as well.  I got the spicy basil rice and was not impressed. It seemed to be missing something. It was a level 3 spice, which is nice but there wasn't that Thai basil flavor that I love. Service was lightening quick, and friendly. I just was not blown away by my meal. I'll drive to pan Asian next time or just stick with Panna for my spicy basil rice."}
{"text":"This is my first time here with my boyfriend, and we absolutely loved it! We will definitely be coming back. We ordered the pad Thai and kung pao not to mention the Thai tea is bomb. The girl attending us was also really nice."}
{"text":"Best I have ever had I was on vacation in Las Vegas but I always eat off the strip this time I went way off and found a jewel."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai food on this side of town! Always great service and very quick on pick up orders!"}
{"text":"I have never had Tom Kha Soup before.  I've always opted for Tom Yum Goong Soup instead.  However, after hearing my friend raved on and on about Tom Kha, I stopped by Surang to try the Tom Kha there, but only after I have read the reviews and especially when my good friend Debbie N. vouched for the soup here.    I have to agree with everything she has written.  The Tom Kha Soup was indeed creamy and full of flavor.  I can taste the combination of the lemon grass, cilantro, kaffir lime leaves in every sip.  From a scale of 1-10 spiciness, I chose 6.  This heat greatly intensify the soup.  The restaurant is simple and small, had 6 tables or so.  Very clean and the staff are very friendly.  I was standing to wait for my to-go order, but the owner pulled out a chair and invite me to sit.  I will come again to write about the dining experience.    I wish they had duck curry though...that's one of my most favorite Thai entree.  Other than that, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Surang's has never let me down. The food quality is high, the taste is fantastic, they consistently provide delicious and authentic Thai food.   My usual picks are chicken green curry, beef Pad Se Ew, or masaman curry- all very tasty. The Thai beef jersey is delicious"}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been going to Surangs for several months and I've yet to be disappointed!   My favorites: 1. Chicken pad Thai  - Delicious! I can't come here and not get it. - Portions are huge, you can split it and still be full.  2. Massaman curry  - Love that coconut milk!  - Potatoes could be more tender.  Service:  1. They are fast, I always have my food within 5 minutes. 2. friendly staff   Capacity is only 35 people, if you go during lunch expect to wait.   Great hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Great food, incredible prices...what's not to like?  Spicy basil pork is my choice here."}
{"text":"Yum! My favorite thai place and it just so happens to be down the street! I messed up once and went to Panna but their food was nowhere near as good. I've lived in Thailand and this is killer. Usually get: Pad Thai w/ pork spicy 5 Papaya Salad w/ no dried Shrimp spicy 5 Fried spring roll Sticky rice Pad Kea Mow with pork spicy 5-6 Have tried other dishes as well and everything is amazing.  Best. Thai. Tea. Perfect level of so iciness and creaminess. Just like in Bangkok ;)"}
{"text":"Loved the place.. Very DELICIOUS!!  We had the beef jerky, crispy pork and fried rice crab.. all were very tasty. Highly recommended! The fried rice had actual crab meat! No immitation or any fake crab meat. It was sooo goood.  the server guy is also very nice."}
{"text":"Great curry with a relaxing atmosphere made for a pleasant meal.  Nice ice cubes in the water."}
{"text":"I think we have found a new favorite for our yellow and green curry dishes they are amazing . The chicken satay skewers were fresh very tasty and also amazing also the service was quick and very friendly. We will definitely come back often to enjoy this great place!!"}
{"text":"I was on that side of town and was craving some Thai food. I used YELP to find something near by. I called and ordered take out.  The lady was very polite and I could feel a smile on her face. Chicken Pad Thai was amazing!!! Highly recommend trying this Thai place!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! Reminds me of the Thai food back in L.a. Crab fried rice, pad see eww, Thai toast all delicious favorites of mine. If ur new u gotta try those."}
{"text":"Love Surangs Thai food!!! Always fresh cooked!!! Our preference for Thai food.  We'll keep coming always!!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the food is good,servers are very nice.You should try it if you luke thai food"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Food is authentic and flavorful. Great prices, I dined in once for a family of 6 and everyone was full. Bill only came up to $80. Take out is quick."}
{"text":"We love coming to this joint. Love the chinese broccoli with crispy pork that they serve. It's about the only Thai restaurant that we found that serves this dish. We highly recommend this place for ur authentic Thai Food cravings."}
{"text":"Surang's is my favorite Thai place in Vegas. The food is always delicious and perfectly consistent! Everything is well priced on the menu. The service is always great. The staff is super friendly every time we come ! I tell everyone about this great spot in the south west!"}
{"text":"How disappointing!  We will say, the thai iced tea was great. The pad cha seafood dish was decent, not great. The country curry was a total disappointment- it was like a flavorless broth with a bunch of random veggies in it-not creamy with coconut milk at all. And the restaurant response was disappointing when we asked for them go substitute it for another dish because it was so bad- they just denied the request and we paid in full for it despite eating none of it. The pad ke mow was good though. Not coming back ever!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my few favorite restaurants in vegas. Affordable and the food is super delish esp the pad see eew and the beef fried rice! The staffs are also super friendly and i love bringing my friends and family here who are visiting town:)"}
{"text":"This place is so good one of my favorite place to eat at while in Vegas. Definitely finger licking good"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat lunch and this place has lunch specials for about $8-9, depending on what you get. I ordered a Chicken Pad Thai and my sister ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup, with two Thai iced teas as well. The service is fast and the staff are friendly. The portions are more than enough and it also comes with a side of salad and crab rangoons. That's a great deal for lunch! It was delicious and I ended up having leftovers as well. I'll definitely be back if I want Thai food. Probably one of my favorite spots for Thai food!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Thai restaurant to where I live, so there's not much of a choice when it comes to Thais. Thankfully, my only choice serve really good Thai food.  Their Pad-See-Ew is very good.  They also have a good choice of curries.  Their red and green curries are to die for, but my go to is their Panang.  Service is great, servers are nice and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Came here with hubby during lunch time and it wasn't busy. Great thing because the service was fast and the lady serving us is very nice and helpful. Food is also tasty and big portion. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to go a bit out of the way and try Surang's tonight.  It was quite good.  We had an order of spring rolls with tamarind sauce that was excellent.  My wife had the Spicy Basil with ground chicken and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken.  Her spiciness was 0 and mine was 6.  Both dishes were very tasty.  A note on their spiciness--I think their 6 is more a 7 or 8 at other Thai restaurants so choose the number with care.  I didn't need any more spice even though I usually order a level of 8 at other places.  I had the Thai coffee which I liked a lot.  The only thing that detracted from dinner was that the dishes were a bit heavy with salt.  That's unusual for me to say, because I am a serial salter.  Service was excellent!  The waitress was very helpful, cheerful, and she was a pleasure to talk with.  She gave us coupons for a return visit just in case we didn't get another Restaurant.com certificate.    While it is out of the way for us, I won't hesitate to return and I'm going to suggest our hiking group stop there for lunch the next time we decide to treat ourselves.  The lunch specials are priced well and sound great!"}
{"text":"Great Thai. Quick and easy and really really good food! Service is great and very pleasant.   Careful with how spicy the dishes are. A number 4 or 5 is already VERY spicy."}
{"text":"Surang's has great extremely tasty food and a friendly staff! The Chicken fried rice is some of the best I've had in Vegas"}
{"text":"Um hello?  Why did I just barely find out about this place? I should have came here a long time ago because dude, what a deal!  This place looks like a fast eat restaurant but serves sit down quality food.  Yum!  1 star = for the quick service.   All of the plates came less than 10 minutes after ordering.  2 stars = for the cleanliness of the place.  I wasn't afraid to eat off their plates, and in their clean environment.  People don't normally Yelp about this, but this place was clean man!  3 stars = for the Pad See Ew, best I have ever tasted; they are not shady with the Chinese broccoli so it made it all the better!  and the amount of egg, generous!  4 stars = Catfish delight.   Catfish isn't for the luxurious type, but i love fish and all kinds, and it's the best I've ever tasted at any Thai restaurant in Vegas  5 stars = for the combination seafood green curry.  Like, what other Thai restaurant has this option? No where else!  This place is awesome and is the cheapest Thai restaurant I have found in Vegas.  Lucky am I that I Yelped this place.  Thank you Yelp!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food, staff is friendly and the food comes out from the kitchen quick, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the pad see ew and pad thai here. I've been to Thailand several times and it's hard to compare food here to there due to the freshness you can get in Thailand, but Surang's tastes pretty damn close. The people are always friendly and the portions are large. I highly recommend them:)"}
{"text":"I normally go to Archi's for Thai food but figured I would try this place out. Ordered the yellow curry and the flavor was decent but the consistency was more like a soup instead of the type of curry I'm used to. It just needs to be a lil more dense and creamy. Additionally I did t feel like they put enough ingredients such as chicken and potatoes."}
{"text":"The chicken satay was juicy and tender. I also had the chicken pineapple fried rice, I asked for a spicy 5 and it was right on the money for the spicy level. Most of the time others places lack the heat or is too spicy. Overall the food was great and the service was better"}
{"text":"This place is great for their lunch specials. Servers very attentive, fast service, cooked fresh to order, and delicious plate served. $8.60 for a dish plate which includes soup and delicious crispy wontons and salad. Can't beat that when you're hungry! I'm happy it's a walking distance from our house. One gem spot."}
{"text":"Yummy Tom Kha Soup and love the creamy texture - some places are too watery.  One of my favorite apps is the Tod Mun which is the fried fish cake, but we tried the Shrimp cake and it was amazing. The mixture wasn't like the gross chewy fake seafood meat. This was real ground shrimp fried with panko.   Kudos to the restaurant for being honest about not having good sticky rice for the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"Surang's Thai Kitchen is the bomb. My husband and I got back from Thailand last week (we were craving Thai food) and this place did not disappoint. I ordered their shrimp tom yum with egg noodles and my husband ordered po tak w/ egg noodles and it was delicious! Their crab fried rice, shrimp curry fried rice, shrimp roll, sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream, and Thai iced tea is delectable as well. The lady who served us was very warm and friendly. It's in a good location because it's very close to our home on the west side of town and I personally think the food is better than Archie's. The only thing is I wish they carried prik nam pla in their spice rack. They only have fish sauce by itself, but the fish sauce with thai chili peppers is even better!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! 5 star service! Delivery with them has been fast as well as take out! The food is delicious and authentic plus amazing customer service. Right now it's mango season so check out the sticky rice mango dessert guys before it's gone! :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Always great food! Consistent and very friendly!  We've been eating here for several years and it's always great!"}
{"text":"Some great dishes that are my fave are, Pad Thai, rad nar, papaya salad, Pad kea mow,  thai macaroni, Tom yum soup, beef salad, thai ice coffee, thai ice tea, maybe just saying the whole menu is great"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent !! Best Thai in vegas I stopped here on a climbing trip to red rock outside of the city and it was absolutely glorious , good green curry and fried tofu"}
{"text":"Ive been going to this thai food and all i can say is the customer service is amazing! The staff are friendly and smiles a alot. The ambient inside feels like youre at home. Food is always great and is made on spot so its always fresh.   Ill recommend the Pad thai, fried tofu and the combination fried rice."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the chicken fried rice. I want it every single day. And they are fairly nice!"}
{"text":"Crispy pork basil is so good.  Tasty papaya salad too. This is my new fave thai resto."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. INCREDIBLE. The service is top notch - the servers recognize us the moment we walk in the door and are so warm and friendly. The food is authentic and reminds me so much of a good home cooked meal that I get homesick for Asia. I think the only bad thing is that we live outside of their delivery area...orrrrrr maybe that's a GOOD thing because I wouldn't have any money left after trying to force them to take my entire paycheck!!"}
{"text":"Took the family out to eat dinner and we were all craving for some Tom yum. Saw this place and thought I give it a try. Pricing wasn't  bad although I didn't understand why they didnt give rice along with the soup. Asian culture we eat rice with everything doesn't matter if it's soup or not. I didn't understand why it wasn't handed out along with the soup.   Overall great customer service and decent pricings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai place in Vegas for take out. The food is always flavorful and fresh. The staff is very friendly. Ive traveled over 18 countries so when i say a place is Amazing its Amazing"}
{"text":"Oh yes, I still like Surang's. This time I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup to go. The beef broth was very \"beefy\" and very flavorful. The beef was a lil tough to chew, but overall still good. The rice noodles that came with it were wider than the ones that come with pho.  Service was quick and with a coupon for 3 dollars of 15 bucks it was definitely a steal!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food at a fair price. The yelp reviews were spot on. Will be going back !"}
{"text":"Trying to be adventurous one night, we wanted to try something new and thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, I came across Surang's Thai Kitchen. There were many check-ins by fellow Yelpers and never tried it before, so t'was our choice of the night.  It's down the street from us, in a not-so-busy strip mall so parking hasn't been a hassle on each of our visits. She's a smaller restaurant, not what I expected. I noticed a lot of people coming in for take-out.   THE EATS: Papaya Salad, Basil with ground chicken and Tom Yum with Shrimp. I mean, it's really hard to mess these up and unfortunately I have been to places where they have messed it up, but this place had these dishes spot on. I also like the fact that they do not bring out the soup in one of those fire bowls LOL, I always feel like my accident prone self will light my hair on fire or something silly as such.  Their lunch specials are pretty good, $6.95-$7.95 and the portions are pretty big for what you pay for.  Prices are a little cheaper than Basil 'n' Thyme and considering that Surang's is closer to us, looks like we've got a new Thai restaurant to add to our favorites list!"}
{"text":"Trying this place out since my sister-in-law said  food is on point small place good staff let's see if they can put me into a food coma"}
{"text":"Really good Spicy Chicken Basil with salad and crispy crab rangoon on the side! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood eat & their delivery charge is very reasonable if you aren't in the mood to go out. I live the Fish Toast - you have to try it. It's comes with pickled cucumbers, so good. For main dishes the spicy chicken basil is a fav but beware even a medium is pretty spicy. I also get the pineapple rice with cashews. The veggie soup or egg rolls are delish too but the portions are pretty generous."}
{"text":"I love the food and thai ice tea here. Service can be sometimes slow but they are always friendly. Om is by far my favorite server. Shes efficient, quick and sweet . she makes sure to come up to you as soon as u sit down, brings drinks to the table and take your order all in a timely matter  unlike the other servers :/ ..sorry not saying theyre bad . but I work as a server  in a restaurant and that is the two main things that customers look out for...also what happened to the big glasses they use for the thai tea?? :("}
{"text":"They deliver which is awesome. Usually 20-30 min depending on where u live. This place is 5 min away from me.   Lunch specials during weekdays are great, but dine in only.   I love their yellow curry, pad thai noodles, and tom yum soup. Bonus: they serve brown rice!! Great for health conscious people like myself!  I've never had any dish that I didn't like. When my mom comes to town from Hawaii, this is where I bring her!! She loves this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around! Whenever I call in my order I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes. I always tell everyone about Surangs!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere very friendly staff. Food is good didn't have to wait too long for the food neither for a sit down restaurant I shall recommend this place to all the people to try this place out."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant, their food is super yummy and literally made from scratch, fresh for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a Great place to eat Thai. I got egg rolls and Pad Cha. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go on Sunday 2/16/14. We got the stuffed chicken which was ok. The spicy basil with ground chicken was delicious, spice level at 4 was just enough heat! Also got chicken satay and green curry at a spice level of 2, both very good as well. The gentleman who helped me was very nice and patient, I wasn't sure about the menu. I would like to come back to try out more items off their menu"}
{"text":"Surang's never let's us down. Food is always quick and fresh and I appreciate the fact that I can identify all the ingredients in their dishes. This is one of the few places that does not make contestant errors in our delivery orders and the staff is very accommodating and friendly. Consistency is key and they deliver consistency and quality."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, and fast! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. The food is very high quality and is super tasty. The curries are great and the salads are fantastic. I've tried lots of items on the menu and have never been let down. My only complaint is that the portion sizes are a little small if you are really hungry. We've taken friends and family members to this place and everybody loves it."}
{"text":"I love Surang's... Not only do I but my husband and friend do too!! We all go there at least 3 times a week!  There are at least six Thai places in a 6 mile radius and I have tried them all. This is hands down the FRESHEST and Tastiest of them all!!  We all have our favorite dishes and often order off the regular menu even if there are very tempting lunch specials!! I do know that Surang herself goes shopping every morning for the ingredients she will cook that day. Here are some of our favorite dishes.. Cant put them in order because its too hard!! Pad Ke Mow- pork  Green chicken curry #10(spicy)  Thai beef jerky Red curry Chicken These are items we always get... MMMMMMM....... I'm hungry right now, you just might find me there in the next hour or sooner!! Just one last note! I love Surang's!"}
{"text":"Pepper steak, wontons, Thai tea are all delicious!!! Our server was very sweet and attentive! Service was very fast."}
{"text":"Awesome panang curry Good pad kee mao Pad thai was ok, not bad Crunchy pork basil wasn't my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have an amazing chicken of Thai and a Thai egg drop soup that is to die for.  I love how nice and attentive the staff is and how they are timely with to go orders!"}
{"text":"My brother was in town for a day and we didn't have too much time to hang out with our conflicting schedules, yet food always brings people close together!  I though we would hit up Surang's because it was close to home and he had never had Thai food before (sad I know).  Its is a small restaurant, nothing too fancy. I was hoping for a good experience seeing as it was my brother's first time trying Thai food; and  I was a little worried we would be restricted on time because I had to leave for work right after lunch.   The waiters and waitresses were very quick to greet us and take our drink orders.  They gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and were very detailed in taking our orders.  I took the liberty of ordering Pad See Ew for us both.  The food came out rather quickly and hot! My order was incorrect, it was spicy when I requested a level 0 (I am weaksauce).  The waitress apologized and I had plenty of time to finish eating before leaving for work : )  I am a loyal customer of Archi's but this place is a close second best for me!"}
{"text":"Great curry, great soup, great Thai tea. Very flavourful. Reasonable price. Will return."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch on a Friday after 1:00.  Location is great and there is plenty of private parking.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Ordered the lunch spacial Pad Thai with a level 7 spiciness.  Food looked good and tasted great.  Will definitely be back.  Pay with cash or they charge a dollar for credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"we love eating at this Thai food restaurant, it has great food and great service.  I have been to other Thai food restaurant but this place is the best."}
{"text":"This is one of the best thai tea places in town. Really close with Archi's quality and taste. Their Thai Tea is spot on!"}
{"text":"Surang's is in my standard lunch rotation. I've never been here for dinner, so I can only comment on my many lunch experiences.  For whatever reason, there are a lot of Thai places close to my office, but Surang's is my favorite. The lunch special is a great deal, which comes with the soup of the day, fried egg roll, and fried won ton. The lunch portions are generous. Service is always very friendly. However, because there's only one server, if you're there during a lunch rush and the restaurant is full, the service may not be as quick as usual. Normally that isn't an issue though."}
{"text":"we got the fried tofu appetizer, a great beef curry with green onions and the tofu eggplant dish and a thai ice tea. everything was very good and we were enjoying the left overs as well."}
{"text":"I ordered Surang for delivery via UberEAts. Surang's is one of the few Thai places that delivers to me so I was excited to try something new.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls, a noodle dish (Pad Kee Mow), and country curry (the one without the coconut milk).  The food was dropped off in a relatively timely manner, even though the delivery driver got lost on the way here. (Of course, that has nothing to do with the restaurant since we ordered through UberEats.)  Here's how everything stacked up:  Fresh spring rolls: 1 out of 5.  They wrapped them in saran wrap, which made the rice paper slimy and sticky.  The contents slid right out when you tried to bite into it.  Also, some ingredients were warm, which messed up the texture of the cold ingredients.  Pad kee mow: 4 out of 5. The dish wasn't overly oily, and there was no aftermath, so that's a good sign.  Flavor was good, not mind-blowing.   Country curry: 3?? out of 5. I don't know. There wasn't a ton of flavor and it was more soupy than the country curries I've had in the past.    The rice was excellent though - 5 out 5.   The weird thing was that when you ordered, they never asked how spicy you want the food. I don't know if that's an issue with UberEats or this restaurant, but I'd have loved to have the option for spicier food."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky this restaurant is walking distance from my house. The food is great. Pad Thai chicken was the best. Fresh taste, and the chicken was not overcooked like every other time I have had it. The chicken satay was also very tender and flavorful. The dipping sauces were even fresh and homemade. They even give you little condiment containers for the to-go leftovers. Very nice people and good service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best thing: the Thai egg rolls. Ordered delivery and was it would take 35-40 minutes it took almost an hour! I saw someone parked at my gate I didn't really think about it until 20 minutes pass and they finally call saying they can't get in my gate...I gave them the code twice before they even left their restaurant!!  We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and pad Thai chicken..both had very little flavor and sweet and sour chicken spilled out of the carton while in the bag-it was clear it was carelessly put into the container.  They didn't apologize for it being late to offer a discount for this time or future visits. I most definitely will never be ordering from here again and will tell friends to avoid it!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. I had the Pad Kea Mow and my  friend had Chrispy Pork Panang. I don't like to use the word perfect but both certainly as close to perfect.   I can wait to come back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is very nice and fresh! The waitress was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the pineapple curry, and the taste was good. The only thing is that it's not spicy enough. It feels more catered to American tastes, but I prefer more spicy and flavorful Thai dishes. Other than that, the prices are great and I didn't have a bad experience."}
{"text":"$11 for yen ta fo, came with two little shrimps and two smaller pieces of squid, nothing else. And the broth was bland.I have been getting take out here fir a long time. I guess i will have to find a new place."}
{"text":"Food came out hot and steamy. First time here and great service. Cream cheese crab won tons were a great choice."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant on For u apache. Awsome food, great service. padthai and Tom Ka Kai is my fave. we are here at least twice a week"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with simple decor, but IMPO the food taste is the best among the rest of the Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Bad service..waitress made mistake about our order and another waitress blamed on us...WHAT??!! However, the younger waitress is nice......Meat and seafood is not fresh.... the food is more at sour side.....we r the only customer in the lunch time....wrong wrong decision to eat here...the thai style noodle house is much more better (which is within 2 minutes walk way)..."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I love great food and found this to be mediocre Thai food at best. The pad Thai, fried rice and pineapple curry all lacked flavor. The curry was requested to be 7/10 spicy and was mild at best, I tasted no heat. I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Consistent good thai. Fast delivery, extremely nice if you dine inside. I eat here a little too often actually. Lol"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   I used to come here on a regular basis five and plus years ago. I stopped coming here because they were lacking the consistency. I came in couple days out of convenience. Here's what I've tried.   Pad kee mao (5/5): this was one of my favorite item from this place and still is! This rice noodle dish seems to be very easy to made, but many Thai places in town can't get the flavor right.   Tom yum noodle soup (3/5): a decent noodle soup with ground pork, fish balls and tofu. I wish it's more sour though.   Thai beef salad (1/5): I have gotten this before and it was decent in my memory. I had to send it back to the kitchen because the beef was very tough and didn't even taste like beef. It was not edible at all.   The lady who served us was nice and attentive. I would definitely come back for my pad kee mao again. Not sure about other items though."}
{"text":"Surang's has become our fav Thai place in our neighborhood! It's a cute little family owned joint that serves up some yummy food. Every time we've been here we always sit at the same table and there has never been any other parties dining so the food comes out super fast!   The food tastes authentic and is a perfect blend of spicy, sour & sweet! Some of our favs include Chicken Larb, Shrimp Panang Curry, Pad See Ewe, Mint Chicken & Chicken Tom Kha Soup! The soup doesn't come with the cool flame warming thing that most places serve theirs in but it's still just as hot and delicious! Service has always been friendly although sometimes there is a slight language barrier~  My only gripe with this place are the chairs...I hate how far back the back base is.. I need more support for my back! LOL they should put some cushions on them or something~"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a nice intimate time with someone or on your own and has authentic thai food that is very good!!! I would try it sometime ! GREAT SMILING SERVICE from the host also that takes the ord"}
{"text":"We had our food delivered so I can't speak of the dinning experience. The delivery was quick for a Saturday night, in under 30 mins. Yummy, satisfying, and we will be regulars for sure! We had the beef salad, A. The papaya salad, A. The spicy basil with ground chicken, A. And the spicy eggplant A+! Everything was fresh with lots of fresh and tasty vegetables. We got it all at a medium 5, so a nice little kick to it. It came with a big container of steamed rice. We have lots of leftovers too."}
{"text":"The food is delicious every time I come here. I like my stuff very spicy.. I usually order level 25, up to level 50 and it still has taste and flavor, not overpowered by the extreme spice. They are always friendly and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere and especially well prepared, fresh meals. Some of the best Thai foods I've had in a restaurant. Don't miss this location if you love Thai food. The young man that was our waiter was especially attentive and caring."}
{"text":"I do not live on this side of town but whenever I am on this side of town I stop here. I have been to so many Thai restaurants. This one has the best Thai basil for sure.....  I go to other places and it makes me miss Surang's Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"Best local spot for Thai food! Love their Pad Thai, Silver Noodle Soup, and Shrimp Fried Rice. Service is always great, host is always attentive, and location is easy to access (off 215/Russell)."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Definitely would recommend. Not super inexpensive but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I've gotten great food here most of the time. There thai tea is not great! More milky and sweet than most places. Overall it's better than most"}
{"text":"I ended up at brunch and then spent the day with a few Yelpers until it was dinner time so we settled on grabbing something closeby. Anthony M, David S. and I did family style.   Chicken tom yum - this was nice since it was cold outside! The base tamarind, lemongrass and keffir was bold which I appreciated. I don't like mild tom yums so this was happy indeed.   Crispy pancake w/ mussels - I've never had a Thai pancake but love all forms of savory. The batter that holds it is chewy in like a mochi like texture and the outside is crispy and eggy. It's served with a sweet and sour type sauce which was good with it.   Country curry with tofu - I've never had country curry and neither did they so we figured why not? It wasn't like any curry with sauce, it was a broth. It was plentiful with veggies and tofu but this dish wasn't memorable at all. We also already have a soup and it felt like we had two and this curry broth/sauce wasn't very strong at all. Pass on this.   Crispy pork - oh noms! I love crispy pork and the garlicky sauce is great with it and zucchini slices. It's thin sliced and then fried so all the surface is crispy. It's great for fans of crispy pata, chicaron, or any other crispy pork bits. I like a tiny bit with vinegared chilis which kicks it up for me.   Service was quiet, but decent and filled out waters and our hot tea.   It's pretty obvious I love Thai food and am not normally in this area, but have been meaning to try it. I think it's rather solid and would say to give it a try.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 21/100)"}
{"text":"I've been here for years and this restaurant is one of the best I've e er been to. Always has the best food and great customer service. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One sunny afternoon I decided to not go too far to eat some thai food. Just go around the corner since you have a 4 star yelp restaurant that should do the job right.  Unfortunately thats not the case for me. Although the food is good but its way too sweet. Its like the chef dump bunches of sugar in it. I think I might get diabetes coming out of the restaurant.   I am sory Surang's Thai, you are not for me. I would drive a little bit further for Thai Food now."}
{"text":"Food was cold and I ordered my sister egg drop soup and there was plastic in her soup. Wtf numerous plastic shards. Extremely upsetting"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I recommend the seafood soup (Potak) and the shrimp padthai and the tai tea."}
{"text":"I'm only posting this review as a warning.  The Catfish Delight is way too oily! The texture was also slimy.  Surangs is usually so good.  Maybe this just isn't my thing. I will continue to be a customer though. Their service is always great and The Pad Thai and Pad Woon Sen are great!"}
{"text":"Thai egg rolls, and pad see ew was very good. The food was warm. Only thing I have to say is for 4 Thai egg rolls...one little plum sauce that is half full in a little condiment cup is not enough, especially when sharing the sauce."}
{"text":"Very fresh!!! One of the BETTER Thai restaurants I would definitely try again. Nice clean and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I think this is the only Thai restaurant around here. I enjoy red curry very much however I wish I have more choice of authentic thai food since I just got back from Thailand enjoying their traditional authentic foods."}
{"text":"Apparently it's common practice for a thin layer Penang curry, barely having enough to enjoy your rice. At least that's what I was told by our server. And I've been to many of the top Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas, or been to Thailand, so what do I know?   The flavors of the dish were good, nothing to write home about and small portions. I didn't quite experience friendly service, but I would say polite. I did find it curious the owner opted to have Christmas music playing in February, and not of the Asian influence."}
{"text":"Surangs is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Fantastic food and fantastic service. My favorite is the beef Larb. Perfect mix of spicy and citrus! Delicious!   Than you!"}
{"text":"On my own for lunch in an unfamiliar part of town, I didn't know what to do! Then I saw it: Surang's, a place I recognized from glowing yelps, so I had to give it a try. What followed was great success.  First, the service and atmosphere are thairrific. The waitress who greeted and served me was smiling with laughter in her voice from the moment I entered. Plus, the restaurant is new and clean.  I went with the red curry lunch special, which includes soup, a fried spring roll, and a fried wonton. At many places, the lunch special soup is a flavorless concoction that includes snow peas, but here it was a cucumber chicken soup, a clear broth with a savory flavor. I slurped it up. The curry was complex, good enough to drink filled with fresh veggies. It was a thin curry. (I used to prefer a thicker curry, but now I think a thin curry is better for you and retains more of the flavors.)   Everything came out piping hot and looked like it was prepared with love. Even the spring roll appeared homemade with layers of flakiness and a scrumptious veggie filling. I don't usually eat an entire roll, but I definitely finished this one. If it were closer, Surang's would definitely make my regular rotation.  The only negative: They charge $2 for brown rice, but at least they have it as an option!"}
{"text":"The pineapple fried rice, tom kha and pad thai were all so amazing!! The restaurant is also very clean and the service is great!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place soooooooo much, their rice is moist and delish. The Pad ginger is the best thing EVER. The egg rolls are bomb.com, they are so soft and crunchy and just oo la la.  Your baby corn is LIFE Life baby. Your water is so refreshing. Thank You, I can't live without your food.  Written by my children."}
{"text":"I love this place! The garlic pepper chicken is soooooo flavorful and good every time I order! Oh and the Thai tea is yummy too. Good little place."}
{"text":"I'm bummed because I've ordered from this place many times since my first review, but the one thing I learned was that the inconsistency- the chef can't seem to get the spiciness level straight I'll order an 8 and get a 6, or order a 6 and get and 8. It bugs."}
{"text":"Since my wife is of Hispanic descent, her journey into the world of Asian delicatessens has been slow and cautious.  However, this Thai place is her favorite because of the tastes and flavors... and I was threaten with severe bodily harm if I should ever go back without her next time.   This joint is a great family owned hole in the wall Thai restaurant that should be a must try for all Thai food lovers.    Tip- the mango ice tea is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here today with my family, this is a must visit everytime they are in town , we always order crab fried rice which is always tasty , a thai toast and fish cake that is always appetizing,a pad thai thats always consistent in flavor and texture, thai ice tea that are always creamy and refreshing ... they have a wide variety of entree choices that are also delicious but we just stick to our favorite :)) the service is always great and attentive as well tammy is awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. First time here, thai egg rolls, Tom Yum soup with shrimp and silver noodles, thai beef jerky and beef basil fried rice....small lil spot in a strip mall, definitely not fancy, but where they are lacking in ambiance they certainly make up for it with their tasty offerings..."}
{"text":"Haven't been to too many thai places, but I can't imagine it getting much better than Surang's. I've been to Archie's before and it doesn't even compare. Everything at Surang's that i've had is delicious including the pad thai, thai tea and pineapple friedrice. But the panang and yellow curry are to die for!"}
{"text":"The pad tai was flavorful, but I paid extra to add extra shrimp.  There were 2.  Only 2.  I guess when you get the combination, it usually comes with 1.  Only 1.  The spring rolls were tasteless and the dipping sauce for the spring rolls was not good.  I'm surprised it has five star reviews."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in a while. All the curries are delicious. The only problem is the small portions.  Pros: food and service cons: Small portions"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered 1. Pad thai beef, 9.95 2. Spicy eggplant with tofu, 8.95 3. Yellow curry chicken, 9.95  for 35  - Seated and ordered quickly. Food came fresh to us within 10 minutes.  - Friendly and attentive service. Clean restaurant.  - white rice not in a single portion but in a family style rice bowl. plus!  - Medium tasted like a mild. Good thing they gave a spice rack.  - Flavoring was robust but I think it's because they added too much fish sauce. Started to taste like Filipino food. Haha.  - Eggplant was soft and cooked thoroughly. A bit too oily.  - Yellow curry tasted great. Potato and carrot slices had nice ridges and cut very well. Onion slices too big.  - Beef in pad thai was tender. Noodles were a bit chewy. Average."}
{"text":"The Yelp party never stops. A long day of drinking and rocking out at a UYE left a few of us stragglers to fend for ourselves. 8 hours after leaving brunch, we were finally sober and starving. Some of our first choices were closed and this area of town boasts a large selection of Thai restaurants.  Anthony M. had suggested trying this place, so Jade W. and I filed suit. In Yelp fashion, we got a selection to share, took pictures of it all, and made mental notes on it all.  Chicken Tom Yum: Possesses a strong tamarin flavor. It was what we all needed on a cold day.  Mussels Crispy Pancake: I won't compare it to a Korean pancake, but it has its similarity. The edges are browned to perfection. The dipping sauce adds so many dimensions to the dish.  Country Curry with Tofu: My least favorite dish. It is not like any curry I have ever had. It is more loose and had the consistency closer to a soup or broth. The vegetable components within were nice, but I could have passed on this.  Crispy Pork: That was everything it had promised to be. Every open surface of the meat was seared to perfection. It did not matter how long it was sitting in the sauce, it was going to stay crispy. It reminded me of Korean pork belly or crispy patas. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Just hoping my heartbeat doesn't stop from how much I would consume.   I am not a huge fan of Thai food, but Surang's was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Right down the street from my work so when I have a craving for some Thai food this is the place I go.  Love the beef pepper steak lunch special when I get take-out or when my husband meets me for lunch it is always panang curry with beef and pad thai.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Very nice first showing for Surang's.  It's a little far for me to go to from home or work, but I was in the area getting a haircut and didn't hesitate to add another Thai restaurant review to my rapidly expanding \"Thai so good you'll Chrai\" list.    To be honest I've been a little disappointed in branching out to try new Thai joints lately, so maybe as a result of lowered expectations I was very pleased with their offerings.  I ordered my usual, a Basil Lunch Special with Chicken, spiced at level 7.  I was early showing up to pick it up but it didn't take long to get my food.  The restaurant itself seemed nice inside, though I wasn't a fan of the layout as there are some tables on either side of the front of the counter where I paid.  I felt like I was invading someone's private space while I waited.  Service was very friendly and I was in and out in about 4 minutes.  Getting back to the office the first think I noticed which was a change from the norm was instead of coming with an egg-roll it had one of those triangular wonton things.  Yes I was embarrassed even typing that as I don't know their proper name.  It also had a crab rangoon!  The ! is because I've never seen a lunch special that included one, and given that I really shouldn't eat cream cheese with my lactose intolerance, I threw caution to the wind and enjoyed every bite of it.  The Chicken Basil itself was also very good.  It was of the ground up variety, and it was ground up very well.  Anyone who has followed my Thai reviews knows I don't like it when it's only semi ground up, or when there are fatty pieces, so seeing a finely ground version brings a smile to my face.   It actually was very reminiscent of Archi's version, which is a good thing in my book.  If anything I might give it the slightest of edges because it seemed less oily.  The spice level I thought was nearly perfect.  If anything it might not have been spicy enough for my liking of a 7, but it was close.  They do offer brown rice for $1 I believe, but naturally I completely forgot to order it so I ended up with normal sticky white rice.    When all is said and done I thoroughly enjoyed Surang's, and I'm sure I'll end up there again during a future haircut (knock on wood that I still have hair for the foreseeable future)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because it is near my job. The service was top notch. My water glass was kept full. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Fried Rice lunch special with chicken. The rice was perfectly soft with the chicken mixed in bursting with flavor. The prices are very good and the food is even better.   I will definitely eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is a quiet strip mall with a small dinning room, we we're they only ones there for a while, they did have some take out going on while we ate, but not too many coming in to dine, I don't know why, this place is great!  As with most asian menus, I let my husband select and the choices he made were excellent.  We started off with chicken curry , spicy eggplant and tofu, beef massaman and pad thai noodles.  I will say, the curry was a little watery, but had good coconut flavor, the eggplant was spot on and the beef was hardy.  The pad thai was good for me, but my partner thought it to be too sweat.  It's seems that \"Mama\" was in the kitchen doing the cooking, I don't know for sure this was mama but it was an elderly women, and while we ate, I kept hearing birds chirping, I guess that's part of the atmosphere.  I enjoy the dinning experience and would go back."}
{"text":"It's been a little while since we've ordered take out from Surang's but have been going to Surang's since it opened and tonight will be our last for a while to come, if ever again.  The wifey ordered the Pad Kee Mow (beef) and it was excellent and the same as always. I ordered the red curry with beef and I got home to find the curry container half empty. I thought if it had plenty of veggies and beef that I wouldn't sweat it and we'd call it a day. However, there were about 3 tiny pieces of beef in my 1/2 order of curry and I wasn't pleased.  I called the restaurant to explain the problem and was told that they measured everything out and it was the correct amount. After telling them I'd ordered it at least 20 times before and it wasn't correct she insisted it was. Well, I guess we'll be headed back down the street to Panna Thai from now on.  Here's a big hint for the owners of restaurants. When a repeat customer calls and complains about an easily resolved issue you might want to try to make them happy otherwise they go to the competition which is what we'll be doing from now on."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials here! Tasty food, decent portions, great service, plenty of parking. Would recommend to anyone in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"We have been going to Surangs for a few years, and it is always very good. From the soup to the currys. Everything is fresh and delicious. Great local spot."}
{"text":"Food was good. Wait was pretty long even though they were mostly empty. It looked like a big group slowed them down. Ambiance wasn't the greatest. I'd iron opt for take out next time."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for a quick bite to eat. However we wish we had chosen a different place for pad Thai. It just lacked flavor, didn't have enough egg, etc. The fried egg rolls were worse, just carrot, cabbage and no seasoning.  I'm not sure I'll be back to try anything else."}
{"text":"Surangs is our Thai spot whenever we are on that side of town. When the husband used to work in the vicinity   it became a greeting on a first name basis. Eek. With that said, if there's something that keeps us going to a business to the point where they know one of our names...there's certainly something yummy worth going. Considering the options in that area, they're a pretty solid and authentic Thai restaurant.   I ALWAYS order a Pad Prik Pow. Too lazy to explain but if you head to their website, you can browse their menu. When they ask you how spicy, make sure you lowball a bit because a spicy level of 6 could easily be a spicy level of 8 in comparison to other places. BUT! I'm not a super duper spicy eating pro, so you don't have to completely take my word for it.   It is always clean in there, service is prompt, never neglected, or yawning waiting for the tab. It's not a big dining area so getting up to pay isn't difficult to do in the event you have such luck. Their price is pretty fair and comparable to other like establishments and worthed.   In fairness, we haven't been there in awhile so if things have changed, whoops. However, I have had pad Prik pow at other Thai establishments and nothing has compared to the one at Surangs. Dang, I think we are due.   Anyway, definitely recommend! You don't have to cross the desert for it, but if you are in the vicinity with Thai on the tastebuds or feel like going on a drive for Thai...this may be your spot. Kid friendly and a stroller can fit its way in there if you must.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, reasonable prices and friendly service, which is a big plus for me. I'm not very creative in my ordering so I had a Pad Thai and it was very good. Hubby and family loved it."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I'm never disappointed! The owner and the staff are so friendly! Their service is excellent! Best of all, the food is phenomenal! Best Thai food in Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been going here for years. I get their crab Rangoon and Kung pao chicken every time. Delicious"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai places here in Vegas. We used to live up in North Las Vegas and we drove out of our way just to come eat at this Thai restaurant. Everyone here is super nice every time we come in, makes us feel right at home. Food is super good and never had a bad experience. Now that we live closer we will definitely be coming here a lot more often as a regular customer."}
{"text":"Best yellow curry I have tried!"}
{"text":"let me start off by saying this is one of the best Thai places in town! Good prices, Great service and fresh food. MUST GO VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"We order a couple times a month and have yet to have a bad experience. The food is always amazing and the staff is very friendly. I love their chicken pad thai, basil beef, chicken kung pao, and sweet and sour chicken. Highly recommend Surang's!!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with my family took the guy about 5 mins just to give us a menu. Then we ordered our food. And we waited for 10 to 15 min, and still no drinks!! I really did love this place but after today's service definitely won't be back! Sad part my wife who's pregnant wanted to come here just for the Crab ragoos, which she didn't even get!! Pretty disappointed! Wish the female waitress would of been there she's always on point!"}
{"text":"Good food, really fast delivery. Only downfall was the Tom Kha soup. It's really delicious, but it's like eating wood-chip soup. The lemon grass and ginger is really hard and chewy, kinda like eating wood chips!! I have had this soup in many different places and so far this is the only place where I had to spit out splinters!! For $9.95 a soup, I would also like to see more than 4 small pieces of chicken and 3 mushrooms. Also PLEASE CUT DOWN ON THE MULCH PILE at the bottom of the container."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and I can taste the Thai Spice in all the dish we've tried.  Food is excellent! Though serving's a bit smaller than usual. Service is good and great atmosphere.  I will definitely come back and taste other dish.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Friendly staff allowed wife and I to be seated 5 mins before opening. Good thai tea and soup. Phad Thai and Red Curry lunch specials are very large portions and tasty as well. Our potstickers were a lil off colored though like they were frozen, not fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go from Surang's with my coworkers, so this is strictly based on food, not the restaurant or servers.   Called in our lunch order and they were really friendly over the phone and made sure what spicy level we wanted our food. About 15 minutes later, we went to pick it up. When we got there, the food was already bagged and ready to go.   I ordered the mixed vegetables meal (the dinner portion, not the lunch special. Lunch special comes with stuff that I can't/don't eat and menu states \"No Substitutions\") with chicken and requested a level 5 spiciness. So we get back to the office and I open my meal. The veggies and chicken looked great and the side of rice they gave me was HUGE. But, the rice was hard. Not all of it, but a large portion of it was hard. The dish itself was good. It was spicy but it was almost as if it was spiced just for the sake of being spiced, because I think if I hadn't asked for a level 5 of spicy, it'd be bland as h3ll.   One of my coworkers ordered the yellow curry, which was super watery rather than the thicker curry both her and I are used to.   Overall, the price is good. The food is OK. The staff did a good job taking our order over the phone and being friendly when we came in to get our food. If I'm in a pinch, this place might do the trick."}
{"text":"It's okay! I don't like that they still charged me for chicken when I ordered vegetarian so won't be back! But iT was good for lunch! Papaya salad tasted old like it had been sitting for awhile."}
{"text":"Surangs is my favorite Thai place close to my work.  The food is so delicious, menu selection amazing and prices very affordable.  My favorite noodle dish is their seafood pad see-ew."}
{"text":"My son and I like to come here the pad thai with tofu is really good and the chicken satay is good also.  The service is nice and friendly. Yen ta fo is very tasty here would definitely recommend getting it."}
{"text":"I've had take out and delivery from here now and both have been great. Between both experiences, have had the chicken fried rice, Tom Kha soup, egg rolls, crab rangoons and pork pad Thai. All amazing and delicious. Delivery fast and everything arrived just as I ordered and piping hot. New favorite Thai place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is amazing and the food is always delicious. This is the third time my sister and I have come here in less than two months."}
{"text":"I moved to the SW a year ago and have been looking for a great Thai place. Lo and behold- I found Surangs Kitchen on Yelp. And it is amazing! So good! I love all the food I have had from them so far    Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! I would recommend this to anyone looking for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times throughout the years.  Recently came back for lunch over the weekend.  Prior to this visit I brought my mom here and she enjoyed eating here too.  I love their chicken yellow curry! I've tried their pad Thai before and never had a bad meal here.   Love their check in offer. Get their Thai tea. Sooo good.   I recommend coming here if you're looking for Thai food in the southwest area. My favorite Thai spot in my moms neighborhood.   Price point is fair. I'm a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice whole in the wall Thai restaurant, hostess was very helpful and food was very quick for our Tao our order. We will be coming back here especially that it's conveniently down the road from our home."}
{"text":"My sister and I get lunch and dinner from here all the time and it never disappoints. The food is delicious, plentiful, and there's so much variety to pick from."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I'm glad we tried it. The service is great and food was delicious! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here many times and the food has remained consistent. The delivery time is usually within 45 minutes.  Their spice level is from 1-10 with a 7 having a pretty good kick to it. All the dishes we have tried have been delicious, especially the pad kei mow and crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"I love their food! Mango sticky rice is sooo good and the service is always friendly, quick and amazing!"}
{"text":"I feel awkward typing this review as this is the first time my opinion is so different than my fellow Yelpers!  It was just okay for me.  It didn't stand a chance next to my favorite Thai food in Vegas but I wouldn't say it was the worst I've ever had.  It was just okay.  The crab rangoon is the only thing that stuck out as being good in all of the 4 dishes we ate."}
{"text":"Best Thai lunch special in the southwest not to mention right down the street from my house. You know you're a regular when the staff remembers your favorites and your name.   Great staff, great food, great music and for lunch you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Surang's Thai Kitchen is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.   I come here pretty often, and every once in a while I like to try new things. My current favorite is the cashew chicken.   The chicken is cooked perfectly, its juicy for how thinly sliced it is. And the sauce is sweet, but not overly sweet. It complements the chicken very well. And I love how the cashews stay crunchy and add a little bit of extra flavor.  The service is a whole other five star worthy experience. The staff is always very friendly, and they recognize me every time I come in! The owner is so sweet, and I commend her for being a knowledgeable businesswoman.   An added bonus is their Thai tea. They consistently make it perfect! Not too much creamer. I've been to a couple of places and have found that their Thai teas always either have too much or not close to enough creamer.   All around, surang's has everything you would want in a small, hole in the wall type restaurant. It's absolutely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Competition is stiff for Thai food in Spring Valley especially on Ft. Apache.   I stopped by here for lunch one day. They had a grip of lunch specials all for under 10.00   I was intent on getting my penang curry fix which was only 8.99 BTW. The curry was just how I would expect it  NOM NOM! The serving size was big enough to feed 2 people but like a true fattie, I kept it all to myself.   Just a little side note: Thai medium = normal people hot!    Service was very good, the staff was very courteous and friendly I did not have to ask for anything.    The only reason I cant give it 5 stars was that they charged me $2.00 for sticky rice. Cmon Man! You give me a big bowl of jasmine rice with the curry but charge me for a smaller serving of sticky rice?!? Does not compute.   This place has my vote for Thai food on Ft. Apache so far...."}
{"text":"Coming from California (most recently Long Beach), I have a picky taste when it comes to my Thai Food, which happens to be amongst my top 3 faves.  That said, coming to Las Vegas, I have tried a few different spots and have not been very impressed.  So when I came in to have a bite at Surang Thai, I was quite happy with my meal.    Food is great.  Particularly, I had spicy shrimp fried rice and Pad Ka Pow (spicy basil and grounded pork).    Customer service is great.  I had recently come back from Thailand, where all the food was amazingly tasty AND cheap.  So I had a friendly conversation with our server.  Overall, it passed my taste test and when I have a chance to drive over to that area, Surang Thai is my preferred Thai spot of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was definitely good but it's not better than Archi's!! I might have to go there again and order something else but I usually order Spicy Eggplant when I get thai food and the Spicy Eggplant at Archi's is way more spicy and flavorful. The sauce at Surang's was pretty watered down while the sauce at Archi's had a thicker consistency.  The prices are really good though. It's cheaper than Archi's which is nice. For 3 of us, the bill came out to $25!! The waiter was very nice and attentive. I had a regular entree and my parents each got a lunch special. It was a really good amount of food for the price. After reading the reviews, I will definitely go there again and try something else next time."}
{"text":"So, the hubby and I were sitting around, feeling sorry for ourselves as we were both sick.  To make matters worse, he had fly out the next morning for a biz trip, so what do we decide to do?  Order ourselves some spicy thai food to scare away the cold!  Now, the problem lies in the fact that our usual place, Ping Pong is too far south, so we had to make a hard decision and figure out where we could order delivery.  After much deliberation, we settled on Surang's Thai, and let me tell you, it was the best choice!!  I think I may have found a new fav!!  So this is what we ordered:  Shrimp rolls Tom Yum (shrimp version, spicy level 3/4, plenty spicy too!) Chicken Panang (spicy level 5, mouth watering hot, but good!) Chicken Pad Thai (spicy level 3, a little bland, but pretty tasty otherwise)  We devoured the shrimp rolls, which weren't oily, hate that(!),  and I ended up stealing a bit of his Panang, while I refused to share my yummy Tom Yum.  The Tom Yum was not  too sweet, nor too sour, it was a perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and sour and there were plenty of shrimps, and not chewy at all.  The head chef I met in Phuket (Thailand) told me that when a soup tastes a bit too sweet or sour and is chilled, it means it's not fresh, so I can always tell when Tom Yum has been sitting out for a while and then reheated. The curry was a little too spicy for me, but when mixed with rice, it toned down, and the hubby was thrilled the chicken wasn't drowning in sauce.  The Pad Thai was saved for the next day as the soup was filling especially after mixing with a bit of rice.  The delivery was quick as well, which meant all the food was still pretty warm, and the soup was actually a bit hot as well.  Winning!"}
{"text":"Oh what a wonderful find this joint was.   After my disappointing visit to Benjarong, I gave up my quest for a great Thai restaurant within a 2 mile radius of my neighborhood. But literally a few days later, driving home from work famished, I noticed this unusually placed restaurant with a bright neon red sign as I was driving by. I almost shrugged it off, until I realized I didn't register the word \"Thai Kitchen\". I immediately crossed two lanes and busted a biznatch.   When I went in, there was only a single party of two in the middle of their dinner. I took a peek and the food looked and smelled good. The waitress/host quickly and cheerfully greeted me and provided me with a menu after I told her I was taking-out. She was very genuine and even asked me if I needed anything to drink while I was waiting.   Got home. W-o-w. I haven't had such a fine tasting Styrofoam-plated meal in my life. Everything I ordered (Which I'll list below, because I've been to this place about 5-6 times after my initial visit) was piping hot, vibrantly flavorful and most importantly, satisfyingly spicy. Which, on second thought, might be sweat-inducing for most other people. I usually get a 10.. hey, I was raised on Kimchi and Sriracha sauce.  Must-haves: Beef Pad Kapow (Spicy Basil Dish), Chicken Pad Thai, Pork Pad Kea Mow, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang Curry  Overall, this is a \"cute\" little place, that serves excellent Thai food, amongst the best I've had, at a reasonable price and served with a smile. Only downside that I can even think of is that the restaurant can fit 40 people at best.   Dare I say it, when it comes strictly to the food alone, Surang is giving Archi a serious run for his money."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! Soup was just o.k., my boyfriends plate was great, his also looked really good."}
{"text":"First off the food smells delicious and is service is great. 10 out of 10 would come again."}
{"text":"Ahh, I'm really disappointed. Almost every Thai restaurant I've been to has been at least a 4 star when it comes to food. I ordered the pineapple curry and chicken pad thai. The pineapple curry had so much potential. The flavor was kind of there but it was completely watered down. It was almost like tom kha soup. Curry is supposed to be a little thicker. I would rather have a small concentrated version of what I got. I had to just drown my rice with the curry, but it still didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to have. I didn't get a chance to try the pad thai because my boyfriend was the one eating it, but he said it wasn't very good and that he wishes for me to order else where next time. Also the pad thai only had like 3 pieces of chicken which is unsatisfactory. Probably won't be ordering here again unless I had no other choices."}
{"text":"At Surang's, the food has always been very tasty, fresh and ready in good time when I pick up. Whether I've dined in or taken out, the service has always been pleasant and polite. Excellent always. Their pricing is reasonable too. I'm picky when it comes to how my food is made but they never disappoint. I respect consistency, and with many places in town not always being good, I will continue to frequent Surang's."}
{"text":"Very friendly and polite - professional establishment with a good menu selection. There are specials too that are delicious!  Pad thai is tops!"}
{"text":"My fave go to Thai place. Food is always awesome, friendly service, and cute, clean restaurant. They deliver which is a bonus too.   The lunch specials are on point and definitely enough food for some take home biznazz.   One of my fave aspects of this restaurant...they make it hot. Yes, I know I'm a white trash kinda girl but I can handle the heat. Bring it. When I ask for an 8 at other Thai spots, weak sauce. Here, they give me an 8 and it's perfect. Hey, I've dated enough Mexicans, so we know mama can handle the heat..."}
