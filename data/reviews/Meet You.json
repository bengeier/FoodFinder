{"text":"It's in a really convenient location across the street from campus. I go here all the time when I get hungry. I usually get the kung pao chicken and the original milk tea. I will say it's a bit over priced considering they give you plastic utensils and the portions are pretty small. Overall, the atmosphere is cute and is a great place to study after class."}
{"text":"Was walking by after having lunch and decided to stop by for some bubble tea.  The gal at the counter was pretty nice.  Coming from the US wasn't sure if my credit card would work but it did so that was great.  I noticed a majority of customers that walked in spoke Mandarin so that's a good sign.  The employees also seemed to be Chinese/Taiwanese which made it feel more authentic.  Overall I was pretty satisfied with my order of Taro Bubble Tea.  Maybe I'm used to flimsy disposable cups in Minnesota but the one we got here was pretty sturdy.

There were quite a few students studying and some ordered food but since we just ate didn't get to sample any.  There were also some outlets to charge devices if you sat at specific limited spots that also tended to have more comfortable pillows.  Seating was pretty limited though so it might be hard to fit larger groups in during busy periods."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here a bit after noon to pick up a drink. It's near the south edge of campus right on College Street hidden beside the Second Cup. They mostly serve a variety of drinks from bubble tea to coffees to different teas but also some sweets (cakes, pastries) and 1 or 2 meal options (e.g. Kung Pao chicken for $10.99). Their drink prices are competitive compared with other bubble tea places, but their quality seems to be a bit questionable. My friend's pineapple juice with tapioca tasted a bit weird and not that much like pineapple. The tapioca was very chewy though! My chai latte was lukewarm from the start which was definitely a disappointment.

I did see some space for chatting in groups as well as lots of students who were reading or studying here."}
{"text":"Super convenient location which is located right across from the UofT campus. Also, minutes away from the Queen's Park subway station.

Came here a few days ago because I had to get stuff done for school, so I was in the area. The server was really nice, however language barriers may be an issue when visiting this bubble tea joint. However, she suggest a few of their popular items on the menu.

The shop itself is super cute! You can even study there, because it's not noisy. Two main complaints would be that even though they let customers leave their plates and drinks on the table for the servers to clean, it should be cleaned sooner than later. I felt like the whole time I was there, there were a lot of dirty tables with plates and drinks on them. Another concern would be the A/C. It was +30 outside and there was absolutely no A/C which made the shop super humid and unbearably hot!

I got the caramel milk tea with tapioca and wow it was so good! The prices for this bubble tea joint are also pretty good. I would probably come back if I'm in the area, but just for take-out."}
{"text":"OK I know it's partially my fault to order food at a Buble tea shop. But the Kongpao chicken was appalling to look at by all means. It was not freshly prepared. I believed it was boxed fast food bought from supermarket or cooked yesterday. The color of the bell peppers was that of pickles. They threw two pieces of steamed broccoli in. The taste was ok since everything was heavily seasoned. Still with the price 11.00 at lunch, I expect something more decent. They had the nerves to put it on menu, and I regretfully tried."}
