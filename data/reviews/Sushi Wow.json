{"text":"Sushi Wow is officially the worst sushi bar in town from a level of customer service. I used to love this place and lately I have had one bad experience after another. I have gone there several times and they weren't open for business even though their business hours are clearly posted on the front door. The owner has a shitty attitude especially toward customers who have been patronizing his business for a long time. If you want your business to improve, start with your attitude.Most sushi bars don;t have the best selection of wine but who goes to sushi bar looking for good wine right! I'll settle for a glass of wine that's not spoiled....SMH!!!!!!!!!!!! They poured me the last glass of wine they had which was obviously refrigerated weeks too long. I asked for another glass but like I said...IT WAS THE LAST OF THE WINE THEY HAD. On another visit, the sushi chef made me a roll that was amazing so I decided to order it again for lunch the following day until the owner informed me that he the check couldn't make that roll anymore. Shame on me for going back. They have these jalapeno poppers that are to die for so I figured that I would order to go. When I arrived to pick up the order, no greeting and was told that a side of Siracha was $1........ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

SO DONE WITH THIS PLACE. THEY WON'T GET A DIME OF MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AND HE WONDERS WHY HIS BUSINESS IS STRUGGLING."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go and eat. It doesn't matter if it's busy or steady. The food always comes out with a beautiful presentation and always hits the spot. The staff is amazing and I love how they make you feel at home. Talented cook/chefs and polite staff."}
{"text":"This place changed so drastically since last year that I don't really recognize it anymore. It's become disappointing, sad to say. The chefs, managemant, and even the waitresses. They are filled with waitresses now where before there was only 2 which was appropriate for a small business area. The rolls have become small and the taste is different. Not bad different, but not great either. I chose the all-you-can-eat again. Apparently, their new policy is that if you don't finish anything, you pay extra for the left overs. In a business perspective, I understand. However, this place is not my go-to sushi place anymore mainly for that. Their services is good I suppose, but they constantly come around, not lettihn us enjoy ourselves. Like I said earlier, too much waitresses now. Felt like I was being rushed....The atmosphere changed now that they have Korean music videos in the background. It's not as...personal or intimate anymore sad to say. So all in all, I can't give this place more than a 2-star."}
{"text":"Sushi...WOW! I'm a total sushi fanatic! Moving back to Vegas from SoCal I was looking for a new sushi restaurant and came across Sushi Wow! Awesome food, awesome atmosphere and awesome service! Chef Choi and staff not only satisfy your sushi needs but your experience! Must experience for yourself! Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Some douche at the bar who I am assuming is the manager or owner, refused to help us and began yelling at my mother!! The Philly roll was off, the salmon was sour and a dark dingy brownish color instead of the natural pink color. We simply asked to have the roll replaced (after we tasted the roll a few times to be sure it wasn't just that piece) and got attacked! I feel sick to my stomach and have a 10 hour drive ahead of me tomorrow. If I get food poisoning I will raise some hell.  Have been here multiple times and always loved it- even took my friends from out of town here. The service is always extremely slow, but we have dealt with it. The amount of attitude and rudeness we received today was completely uncalled for. The douche even said 'I have a problem with you!' Excuse me??! We were so close to just leaving but paid for the food we had eaten and left. I will never go back to this place again, and I advise against you ever wasting your money here. I never write reviews, but rely heavily on their input so I decided this was a time worthy of one. Take my advice and don't step foot in this place! Rotten sushi and bad customer service ain't nobody got time for that."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and loved it! The staff was very attentive and made sure everything was good! I've gone back twice so yummy! And close to home!"}
{"text":"I would give this place no star if it was possible.. the service is horrible, not friendly at all and they take forever to serve your food. Not only that after I made a payment with my credit card, they went ahead and they change the price to give himself a bigger tip after they didn't do shit."}
{"text":"Super creative sushi chef. The quality was top notch the service was quick and the lobster roll was our of this world.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The customer service was below average. We order AYCE and the waitress was telling the table not to order to much at a time cause it would take 20-30 minutes to get our food, but yet she said we only have an hour to eat. How can you offer AYCE and then limit the amount off food. 

Later in the evening we asked where the rest of our orders are and the sushi chef decide to start lying and yelling, saying that we never ordered anymore only to come back a few minutes later (mind you after they gave us dessert) and said he found the slip with our orders, but this was too late. 

Worst part of the whole thing is that I come to find out the next day that my friends got sick with what was most likely food poisoning. This was a major waste of money and I regret giving it a try."}
{"text":"Chef's specials were so delicious. Price is reasonable. Also friendly staffs are awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner there 3/23/14 with some my family members & the food was not good. My cousin order a screaming orgasum sushi roll a got salad version of what he ordered. So he talk to the owner who was drinking( beer) at the counter area  an the owner him self did not have any costumer edict in response to my cousins complaint. An the waiter him self did not have no edict at all through out the night."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi I have to eat if you to not finish you can not order . they ask me why I didn't finish I said it was bad the owner said get out and do not come back. if the food is that bad I will not come bad"}
{"text":"I've been this place twice already!
Wow wow!! The food was fantastic and services were so nice!  Thank you chef choi! You are the best!!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi, service was excellent, the Crunch Lobster roll is , I think, my favorite roll of all times, and that's saying a lot when I usually do not like lobster! We will definitely be back, got AYCE today but they have a great 50%off sushi roll Happy Hour special we will be checking out next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi sandwiches.  Dang guacamole was very hot.  Not bad for a whole mess of cat scraps."}
{"text":"Off the strip you have to be very careful when you order fish.  Most of it taste like its right out of the freezer and does not taste fresh.  However, Sushi Wow had great tasting fish along with a good mix of rice and other ingredients.   The staff is very friendly, the head manager even sat down with us while they were not busy and went over some really good rolls.

I would give it a shot in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Sushi Wow for several years, and I can honestly say that having been to numerous AYCE sushi joints in the Las Vegas area, I have yet to have a totally bad experience at Sushi Wow.  

The place is small, and their menu maybe not as expansive as other AYCE sushi places, but the quality of the nigiri and rolls are good.  

Although I haven't had a \"bad\" waitress here, their service is definitely hit or miss, especially with drink refills and such.  We did have one instance where the waitress tried to discourage us from ordering several rolls and orders of nigiri up front for the AYCE because she seemed to think it was \"too much\" for our table of 3 normal sized adults.  (3 rolls and several orders of nigiri per person.)  As frequent AYCE sushi patrons, we know pretty much exactly how much we can stuff ourselves silly with, and we know what we like.  After all, isn't that the point of AYCE sushi?  LOL  Anyways, our food came out fast and delicious like always.  I don't know, maybe it was just an off day for her or something, but it felt awkward and weird.

All in all, the other 20-something times I have eaten or ordered takeout from here, it has been fine.  The Lisa Lisa and the Wow Wow Wow are my favorite rolls, and their Japanese Lasagna is my favorite out of all of the dozens of sushi places I have been too here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love BENTO BOXES!!! Finally, a sushi place nearby.  

Try something different with their sushi rolls. I remember one time I was a bit brave, and ordered their Sushi Lasagna. Glad I did because it was a nice concoction with cheese. Try it! Hopefully you'll agree with me. 

And sake-bombs...love 'em!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place they are amazing chef Choy and chef Sarah are phenomenal there hot sake is great and Sapporo is always ice cold. Definitely a must try my favorite thing on the menu is by far the unagi poppers"}
{"text":"Not impressed. These guys were jerks. They rushed us to eat and stood next to my wife and I until we finished, so they can shut down at 9:30 on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Get there early. The rolls are tasty. if there's a crowd come back a different day. All You Can Eat for 2 with Sodas & Taxes(Boo!) cost around 57.00 to 60.00 bucks. I know that's plenty of Jumbo Jacks, but Sushi fans can't complain."}
{"text":"Normally, I would never go to a place called, \"Sushi Wow\", but living in Las Vegas for three years, my standards have gone down.  Way down.  Anyways, I was desperate, and didn't want to drive all the way down to I Love Sushi in Henderson.  (Note: As with Sushi Wow, I wouldn't normally go to a place with such a cheesey name, as it gives me horrid flashbacks of Sushi Lovers by the AMC Mercado in Santa Clara, but it's another three-star sushi place that I'll save for another review.)  A small place, located in a strip mall on the corner of Ann & Simmons, just south of Aliante, the Cantonese-owned Sushi Wow seats about 35.  When it comes to sushi, I'm kind of a snob and a purist; I pretty much only stick to the nigiri.  \"Super-duper-69-screaming-orgasm\" rolls just don't turn me on.  My standard fare when trying a new place: maguro, hamachi, sake, uni, and amaebi.  It wasn't as nasty as most other sushi places in Las Vegas, and definitely a step above all the AYCE places in town.  Reasonably priced, about $3.75 for the standard stuff and $7.50 for uni.  The maguro was flavorless, the uni was obviously not fresh (but I've had much worse at other sushi places), but the rest were decent.  All in all, their sushi was okay, the same quality you'd get at Sushi+Sake at Green Valley Ranch, but with half the price tag (yet another review I will need to work on).  I also tried the $5.25 teriyaki chicken lunch special, which was pretty nasty, their miso soup tastes like they need to add more hon-dashi, and their salad dressing is interestingly decent, the fried oysters are tasty, the udon is udon, and I could do without the flavorless fried soft shell crab.  Their $11.50 sushi special dinner is quite a bargain, as you get soup, salad, and 2 pieces each of maguro, hamachi, sake, whitefish, and unagi.  The bottom line? Go here for the cheap food if you don't feel like driving anywhere, but don't expect it to taste great!"}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome! Super fresh  and service was super friendly! We went at 3pm on a weekday and the place was packed. Which is always a good sign to me. Didn't have to wait long for food at all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to sushi wow today and as always, it was amazing! Service was excellent and stuff wAs very accommodating. Happy hour was a good deal! Full roll for half the price!"}
{"text":"Really expensive for lunch. ive been somewhere better than here and cheaper for lunch. the food was good though i gotta admit just to expensive.i felt bad for our waitress, she was the only one for the whole resturant and she did good."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but after the first round of sushi came out I was sold. This place is a gem, we went back 2 days later! must try.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time, I'm Japanese and knew from the beginning that this fish wasn't the best quality  but love supporting small businesses. Was a regular. But the chef CHOI (the Korean), was an absolute *excuse my language* prick. He refused to let me order certain food, told my friend he could have whatever he wants but I couldn't. He was terrible and I'd be embarrassed to have him in my business. He yells at the waitresses and embarrasses them too. He ruined my experience 100%. Mind you, I've been going here for quite some time!! 
He's terrible. He skims your fish he will always do more rice than fish for all you can eat, to save more money in his pockets. You'll get full on rice before you eat any different varieties of sushi. 
This whole place is ran by unprofessional people. The owner (a Chinese man) with the sharpest tongue. Talks badly about the customers, but is a great chef so there is that. 
This place is a joke. If you order anything, get to go! 
Do not dine in. This place is rude, they'll try to scam any way they can. They are money hungry and do not care about service. Take your hard earned money else where  you deserve  to. 

**UPDATE**  (yesterday when we went,  we did not tip. It was only myself and one other person, turns out this place not only Shit talks you, but steals your money!!! They added a $20 tip to our already $50 tab. 
This place is BULLSHIT. SUSHI WOW IS AWFUL.)"}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant!! Great food and great service!! We always go there have sushi! Fish is really fresh and kitchen food is really good too. They have happy hour 11-3pm every rolls 50%off! Really good price too!!"}
{"text":"Just leaving this place and I know I will be coming back. Food was fast and delicious. Service was good. Prices are not bad at all. Probably not a place to go for a graduation party but nice place if you are hanging out with a few friends. There was only one table that could fit my family of 6. They also have a great variety of rolls to choose from and everything came out fresh. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"More like Sushi DuD! This place is horrible the customer service sucks! The atmosphere is BORING! The food is mediocre and over price. My family and I walked in and walked back out. My 5 year old was carrying a bottle water and we were advised that we can not bring outside drinks. Keep in mind it's only 100 degree outside and he was half way finish with his water.

Of course, that turned us off and we decided to go up the street to our normal sushi spot! Now I understand why this place is always empty!"}
{"text":"Worst ever sushi place in Las Vegas and I been to a lot of them. Will never come back to this place ever. Food and service sucks b....ls."}
{"text":"Food was good, but towards the end of our meal  (all you can eat) I noticed a roach crawling on the wall behind my wife. I informed the waitress and she killed the roach. Right after she kills the roach I notice another and it's bigger. The waitress was unable to catch the bigger roach. I then notice another roach on the table next to us. Nobody was at that table. I was told the reason there were roaches is because the restaurant was sprayed that morning and the roaches were coming out......WTF kind of excuse is that! Needless to say my wife and I were done eating and did not finish the few pieces we had left. Before paying our bill the waitress informs us that they would have to charge us for the pieces we did not eat. They did not charge us for obvious reasons, but even saying that to any customer after seeing roaches in the area you are eating in is ridiculous.....I will not be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Vegas has some really great sushi spots...this my friends is NOT one of them! The AYCE is only $23.99, but buyer beware you get what you pay for. It does not include sashimi and on various items, you're only allowed to order once. I went the All Day Happy Hour, 50% Off all rolls (due to the rule of half orders only on the last roll with AYCE).  Again, you get what you pay for.

Our biggest complaint was the size of the rolls. They were the standard 6-8 pieces each, but they were so skinny...do these guys not realize SIZE MATTERS! The rolls were pinched thin and scant of rice. One of my rolls ALLEGEDLY had spicy tuna but I was hard pressed to find it. 

No happy hour drink specials, one waitress, and a non-functional tap. Not the best dining experience, I recommend passing this place by."}
{"text":"Awesome service, the best sushi rolls in town. Everyone is always really friendly. I love to take my mom there, she really loves it. I love their crunch lobster roll. That is the first one we always order."}
{"text":"I've been coming here at least 1-2 times a month for the past 5 months. Each time is phenomenal! Tonight they were slammed and I could tell short on staff but they still did an amazing job! Team work is definitely making this store operate perfectly! Customer service is above and beyond! I love Sushi Wow! Must try if you haven't already. My ultimate favorite is the \"Crunch Lobster\" and \"Garlic Tuna\". Thanks again Sushi Wow."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.
Highly recommended by a friend.
My Partner and I went to dinner there tonight. All i can say is AMAZING food. So fresh and delicious. The menu had something for everyone. We were warmly greeted by entire staff as we entered. Our server Lovely was so attractive and knowledgeable she made our experience a great one. Anyone who goes there needs to ask for LOVELY. Chef Sara came out and welcomed us followed by HUGS.
Left feeling so good.
Thank you Sushi wow.
Sincerely,
Sean Meehan (customers for life)"}
{"text":"Sara has some WOW service ! 
Thank you so much!!!! 
So delicious.
Absolutely amazon service 
Food came out soooo fast"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place!! Choi gave us very personal service and the sushi is WOW!!!! The flavors were very well balanced!! Lexy roll was awesome and the Rock & roll was great!! They have All you Can Eat $23.99 and have 50% for dine-in if you want to buy individual rolls. Plus they have Mt Dew!! Used to love Sushi Tachi and Kaizen but my new place is Sishi WOW!! 
Small place but very personal. The love of sushi a shows through!!
Well worth the visit. If you are a sushi newbie!!! This is the place to go! They will walk you through the different rolls..."}
{"text":"We went to this place on a whim and it was SO good! The chef and serving staff were super friendly and attentive. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The baked rolls were delicious. Happy hour is from 12-3pm and all sushi rolls are half off. Great deal! Got 5 rolls and green tea tempura ice cream for only 27 dollars. Fed 2 of us and still had some left overs. Love the tempura roll and the Japanese lasagna. Our waitress was really nice as well. Very accommodating."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years now. Recently they have a new girl chef she's amazing very friendly and always making sure everything is okay. And there's a girl waitress don't know her name but has light brown hair she's amazing!!!! Highly recommend this place. They should have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I don't even wanna give a star to this restaurant...but no choice..anyways...do not go this place to eat ..you might get sick..
1. First of all, this restaurant is soooo dirty..I've seen hundreds of cockroaches..(probably) everytime I go to this place to eat, I see at least two of them climbing up to TV or wall..I even spotted on my plate. Health inspector should go there check once a week or so...sooooo dirty...fish was not fresh at that time..DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"In town from Dallas & went here per a recommendation- FANtastic food! Chef Choi made us some incredible dishes as part of the All you can eat special. Will always come back here when I am in town!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good place! Amazing actually ! Would not want to come back though BITCH ASS WAITRESS ! Never gave me my change uhhh exqueeze me bitch! Who gave her bitch ass the right! I might need that for McDonalds later ! Fuck!"}
{"text":"This place seemed great at first, but dont think ill be coming here again they know when u walk in with a group of 5+ they will be tipped 18% which is ok but they will screw up ur order and get lazy with everything, dont know if the staff is new but they totally forgot, not 1 but 2 orders of ours, one of my party members didnt get to eat it and one order was late, they didnt refill our drinks at all."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Great service and sushi is delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"More like Sushi Booooo! We dined but the quality of the fish was awful! I really question the freshness of their products! You do get what you pay for! We'd rather go to Tachi or Kaizen."}
{"text":"Well....where can I start.....my lovely wife and I
 went here for some more amazing sushi when our knees were cut out from beneath us as we walked in .......*sigh*

We were presented with NEW lunch menus that were very disappointing....so my wife and I being addicted to ahi poke salads decided that we would just pay dinner prices so we could just get 1 each which is the restaurant policy but we already knew about it.

So no big deal.....then they killed us by saying that even though you are paying for 2 all you can eat you can only get 1 ahi poke salad per table.........my wife and I knowing this to be false asked the sushi chef on duty and he also said that 1 ahi poke per table.

We outraged by such senseless nonsense left.....the waitress had one of the worst attitudes I've ever experienced ......my wife left them you've been yelped cards and the waitress threw them out the door at her......VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.......a very sad experience since we love sushi and they are close......"}
{"text":"The chef Kim is awesome and makes some killer rolls!!!! Great food and happy hour is awesome my girl and I were full and wasn't pocket gouging!"}
{"text":"Love Sushi Wow the best Sushi so far! Very nice people very homely we try to go once a week!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE!!!!
They're very efficient and kind!! 
I went with my girlfriends and we loved!! 
Good price!!
Taste food."}
{"text":"WOW is the perfect name for this place my mouth was exposed to such a explosion of flavor it's absolutely delicious.... I've been to many competitors in this area I honestly found a place that can focus on the true art of flavor and not load rice to think your getting more for your buck.. sushi is all about flavor I highly recommend you come try this place... I had the dine in only happy hour all day 50% every roll... come experience the experts at there best sushi wow is a 10 in my book.. see chef Kim for his speciality hot sauce..."}
{"text":"Great customer service, nicest staff, old sushi guys know how to dance. Fun place! Great sushi taste!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went with my son for their 50 percent off lunch special on all rolls and now keep coming back. The food is delicious and fresh, and the service and staff are out of this world. Our server (same woman each time we've gone) is so kind and sweet. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant on all points and my family have definitely become regulars. Not sure, but I think the previous bad reviews for this place were before the current owners took over. If someone has had a bad experience in the past, perhaps give it another shot. You will not be disappointed. Another plus, they've introduced  me to a new obsession for Asian pop music which they play on a tv in the corner :)"}
{"text":"One star for the bitching of pouring Sierra Mist to your 2 year old baby's bottle. I can't share my drink with my kid? fu"}
{"text":"Party of 6 was hard to seat, food was awesome. Not the best sushi place I have ever been, but good enough to say we will be back..."}
{"text":"The sushi were really great. The crunch lobster is my new favorite. I will be definitely be recommending friends and family here."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop in by chance and found my new favorite spot to eat.  Chef Choy and Sara were the best.  The food was amazing and the price was very reasonable.  I won't be looking for anywhere new now that I have found this spot. I tried their sushi and a couple rolls but they have such a variety that I will be busy going back.  I am telling you do not miss this place you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I had a great experience had the all you can eat everything was good  rolls where served quickly waitress constantly came up to get more order rolls would definitely go back and half price rolls every day all day that's awesome wasn't a fan of the garlic edema but loved the pop stickers"}
{"text":"I like the service there but it does not mean that you should have to pay so much for sushi i mean 29 dollars for 2 rolls is crazy someone told me about another sushi place thats way cheaper and was really good ill be giving that a try instead food is good here though i just not to pay a arm and leg for sushi"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here because it is so close to home, but we love coming back because of the awesome food and wonderful staff. I have only ever seen 2 different waitresses there, but it is not a large restaurant and they remember their patrons. Same with the chefs. I haven't noticed many different ones, but they do great and quick work and you can tell they are having fun with it. 
This might sound a little strange, but I absolutely love the way their menu is set up. Instead of just listing everything that is used to make the roll like some sort of ingredients list, they list what is on the inside and the outside of each roll separately. This comes in very handy if you are like me and don't like rolls that put a lot of raw fish on the top or you just like to know they layout of the roll ahead of time. 
I also like the value of this place. You have three options: take out (full menu price rolls), dine-in (considered \"happy hour\" even though it is availible all day and it's 50% off all rolls) or All You Can Eat for 24.99. So you have affordable options if you just want a one or two rolls or if you want to eat a big meal.
Overall a great neighborhood place with yummy sushi and fun staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food plus the staff is really nice and funny.  My girlfriend and I love to sit at the sushi bar.  We have visited many times and will continue to be back.  Definitely a great sushi place to check out! :)"}
{"text":"This place went downhill... I went here with my family yesterday and the sushi is VERY bland now. The waitress is nice but I think the boss tells the waitresses to check up often on their tables. I know I sound mean, but it's just too often!!! And if you're gonna check up on us this many times then you could at least give us refills on our drinks. She interrupted us so many freaking times. That waitress yesterday kept yelling her greetings to people who'd open the door unknowingly in my face super loud also. She'd be reaching over to get our empty plates and menus and turn her head and scream her greetings in my face (my back was to the entrance so she was yelling in my direction while she reached before me) I don't really wanna come back here lol it's not really worth it anymore. Bland food and oblivious staff"}
{"text":"I go here maybe once a week ( my husband loves sushi & it's close) during happy hour rolls are half off ultimate shrimp roll is my favorite, ingredients are fresh enough lol presentation is nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here after a really long wait at a different sushi place, I'm not patient and I like to be seated fast. We LOVED it! The sushi was great and the all you can eat was awesome!! I read other reviews on here and I'm not sure what they are talking about maybe it was a bad night/day. We did all you can eat and were allowed to order double of the same sushi rolls. I loved that your last roll is a half roll because when your stuffed but are craving one last one you don't have to opt out. We also tried a couple rolls with spicy tuna and it was spicy (great for some not for us but it was it was delicious!)

The service was awesome l, we've gone back a couple times since our first visit and it's usually the same girls and they are kind, attentive, and happy to help and explain things. 

Honestly, I have been trying to find a place like this since I moved back to Vegas and I'm thrilled that I finally found it. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is some delicious sushi that is always fresh. If you are able to catch the happy hour or all you can eat nights, then you are in for a real treat. I haven't ever been let down, and I recommend i to anyone on the Northeast side of town."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The best sushi ever and it's fresh. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and the first time I didn't get a chance to try the food as my brother was just picking something up. However, tonight was the second time I decided to drop buy and order some food to go.

The staff was extremely friendly making sure they greeted you and spoke to you as you walked in and out the door. I didn't get a chance to try the sushi as I just wanted some tempura and miso soup, but wow was it good.

I'll definitely be dropping by with a few friends to try the sushi and their other offerings."}
{"text":"The name says it ALL - SUSHI  WOW!!!  Such a great place! The rolls, the service, the prices...EXCELLENT!  This will be our new go-to place each time we're in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Says it's open till ten on yelp. Says 11 pm on the door. Walked in at 8 and was denied service. Thanks."}
{"text":"3rd time here. Maybe 4th I can't remember. I do know that it gets better every time. Been to a few sushi spots since moving to Vegas but this is the best by far. Great AYCE and all day everyday happy hour."}
{"text":"Fantastic stuff... got the Yellotail Shashimi and Salmon Roll for lunch today (3/28). First time at Sushi Wow... WoW! is right the service was great (friendly, courteous, fast and helpful in explaining stuff on the menu). The Chef was very friendly and fun too! Great presentation and portions; especially for a to go order! Will definitely be back to try more stuff off the menu..."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of sushi but they have a very friendly staff. 
Chef Choi is very nice and the food is good and also prices are very reasonable! :)"}
{"text":"Have been a few times, always prompt service and a great energy with the staff. Chef Penny hooked us up with some awesome rolls and to make the Vampire roll spicy enough she added some hidden hot sauce kept behind the counter. It was really good! My friend and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Gave Sushi Wow a second time after having a terrible customer service experience a couple years ago. I ordered a Lisa Lisa at the end and the sushi tasted so sweet that I couldn't finish it. I left a couple rolls (which are small) and the waitress told me I had to eat them or I would be charged. I would've finished it if it was actually good. I've been to many Sushi restaurants and not once have I been told I would get charged for a couple rolls left behind. I will never go back again nor the people I took to eat there. How do they expect people to finish their meal if the sushi doesn't taste like it's suppose to?"}
{"text":"The Chefs were very friendly and the servers were nice. I had the all you can eat sushi with my daughter and my son had their shrimp fried rice. Everything was delicious, I loved the Lobster Crunch Roll. My only complaint is that it took a long time to receive the Lobster Crunch Roll both times that I ordered it. I think the second time I ordered it thy gave it to another table because I saw them serve the other table and then when I asked were mine was they said the order was not placed. However, one of the girls confirmed that she placed it and it would be out soon. They were busy as well so it's understandable. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here with my family numerous times and the sushi is excellent. The one thing is they don't rush you and there is no time limit. The best bet is all you can eat sushi it's more than just sushi"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because of all good reviews. Glad we did! Loved all the rolls we had. We had Arizona Yellowtail, Washington Salmon, Shawn's, and an assortment of sashimi! The servers were very attentive (they all checked on us) and the chefs were great! Chef Sarah made us some AMAZING rolls! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place so far that we've found, so far, to eat sushi in Vegas! And trust me, when it comes to sushi and fish, I am extremely picky. Their service is crazy fast, never having to wait more that 3-5 minutes for your order to come out. Super friendly chefs and waitresses. 

I take away a star because although they have great employees, a lot of time they're just standing there starring at you eat. I get they wanna stay on top of it, but sometimes it can be kinda creepy and uncomfortable when someone watches me eat lol."}
{"text":"I love this place...the food is the best my sushi go to
We always find a reason to eat here
Need to try every roll"}
{"text":"I really liked the crunch lobster roll and the Shawn's roll! Would definitely come back. Good customer service good food, and I like the convenience of not having to drive down to china town for some good sushi"}
{"text":"Not quite the wow I was hoping for.

I've already accepted the fact that if its called \"Happy Sushi\" \"Love Sushi\" or some variant of \"Super Tasty sushi\" i'm probably in for some run of the mill McSushi.  

I normally stick with the nigiri and the plain jane tuna/spicy tuna/albacore/salmon skin rolls but every once in a while I'll give a restaurant's \"creative rolls\" a shot. Rolled in here with the gf around 5 pm on Sunday night and got their house special roll - it might have been called SuShi Wow Special or something along those lines. It came out completely drenched in a very very very flavorful sauce that pretty much overpowered the flavor of everything else on the plate.

My seaweed salad was a bit chewier than it should be and I wasn't all that stocked about it.

The restaurant was empty but two other dudes came in here as we were walking out. Its sitting in a parking lot next to Denny's and Walmart. I didn't get any super positive vibes from the place but the service was prompt and friendly. My tea was filled up and the rolls came out quickly.

Hate to say it but I'm not coming back here. It was really a spur of the moment decision that brought me here in the first place."}
{"text":"We drove from Henderson to take advantage of the happy hour deal for Valentine's Day...of course when we arrived, they were not offering the half off deal due to the holiday...My husband was livid that we had just driven 45 minutes to pay what we could have paid at the sushi joint five minutes from our house. I explained the situation to our waitress to let her know that we felt we had just wasted time. She left to grab our drinks...during that time, she must have talked to the manager and explained our frustration because when she returned she informed us that the manager would honor the happy hour deal due to our traveling so far. They could have taken my complaint and done nothing with it, but the manager decided to take action. Due to his customer-friendly decision, my family and I will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not picky with food, especially sushi (even though I probably should be?), like I eat sushi from Smith's and think it's really good..... I'm also not even a fan of rice but something was just not right with their rice here. My sushi rice was VERY hard. It was like, if you have rice out left over for a few hours or overnight and try to eat it without warming it up. I contemplated telling them that I really didn't like the rice, but it might've been pointless. I thought maybe it was just me, so I ordered a few more pieces of nigiri sushi and all of the rice was just so hard and dry every time. I don't eat rolls much, but I ordered a simple spicy tuna roll. I thought maybe the rice would be different for some reason, again. I ate one and was done. It wasn't like spicy tuna that I've had before, it was extremely bitter, not spicy? I don't know what was in there but it just didn't taste like a spicy tuna roll at all. I could see how it was supposed to be a spicy tuna roll I guess, but it was just not it. And again, the rice was hard. It honestly caught me off guard on how it tasted... The rice kind of ruined my appetite at first (on the nigiri), and the spicy tuna roll just ruined it all. I ordered one more yellowtail nigiri and then just got some shrimp tempura udon. 
I mean the fish was alright. The tuna nigiri looked kind of different compared to other places, but it was fine. Some pieces felt a little warm but I tried not to mind. I really wanted to like this place because sometimes driving to chinatown from north lv is a drag. I honestly feel bad for giving it this rating and review because the people there are really nice especially the server :(
I'm hoping my rice issue was just a today kind of thing? Maybe the rice isn't like this on other days? I don't know, I might try it again sometime but I hope that issue is fixed. Like I said I'm not a big fan of rice, but it still compliments the fish so it's kind of distracting when the rice isn't good :(

What I actually ate:
Salmon nigiri, tuna nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, white tuna nigiri, garlic tuna nigiri, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura, the seared tuna sashimi (this was actually really good though)."}
{"text":"This place serves the best Sushi!  The service is great also."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. GO ELSEWHERE. 

Gave Sushi Wow a 2ND chance as I heard they were under new management. 
I ordered for pick up.  Unfortunately, this place is still super EXPENSIVE.  I would not mind paying if the food was good. 
Dropped $50 on 4 rolls. The rice was not cooked throughly on the Lisa Lisa rolls, and the Shrimp tempura roll had (3) fish bones. WTF!!!
Tempura rolls do not contain fish last time I checked. Also never received ginger or wasabi with my order so it was a terribly unsatisfying meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I go there often. The staff knows are names and also helps us in trying something new. Ask for the Red Sox roll. YUMMY! Good Sushi at a good price"}
{"text":"Biggest sushi in town! If you're not satisfied with one then get all you can eat if you dare. Thanks to chef Kim!"}
{"text":"This is the regular spot for me and my husband, at least twice a month. We have tried almost every roll they offer, and I am happy to say that I have not found one I do not like. The Adios Amigo and the Crunch Lobster are the best by far! They also serve Tempura ice cream and Mochi ice cream, which is awesome! Choi is the best, and they are always polite and prompt. Please try this place out!"}
{"text":"Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \"all-you-can eat\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and the food is good, the second time I came here and brought my kids. This experience was pretty much bad customer service, they forgot our orders or forgot that we were still there. I don't think that we are coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was good. They were on it....food was good too. Checked this place out cause it was close to home. Love that they had riceless rolls. I'd come back here....but place is just small...."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome!!! Choi the chef is hilarious and very welcoming! Penny the manager made you feel at home and made the experience top notch. I just moved to the area and I already found my go to joint. Hope you all sleep on this so I can benefit to the max!!! Can't wait to see my boy Choi and my girl penny again this week! Thank you for such a wonderful and fun experience!!! You all are awesome!! The Mexican rolls are amazing!!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's our favorite Sushi place,  and we've tried many.  We usually do the auce ($23.99),  but the lunch happy hour (50% off rolls 11am-3pm) is awesome too!  The bento boxes are great as well and reasonably priced.  You must try this place,  and you must get the Shawns Roll and the Crunch Scallop Roll."}
{"text":"Went in with my girlfriend not expecting much but place impressed me great customer service they all greet you in the way in and just overall great atmosphere and the food was bomb I highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"This little place is so cute! i honestly loved the intimate/ family owned atmosphere. Its Quiet and the service is great. The chef is really nice too.

I only came in here for a fast fix so i only tried their kiss of fire roll, another roll which i dont remember the name of and some garlic edamame..

The kiss of fire is absolutely amazing!! it super spicy though but it doesnt take away from the flavors i am definitely coming back for this roll.
The second roll was good too but it was really limey and im not into that too much but still very delicious! their tuna is great

Only thing is that i probably wouldnt do AYCE here because i didnt see alot of variety for my taste.. but they do have 50% off any roll when you do a la carte dine-in which i think is great"}
{"text":"Wow yeah right. I been coming to this place steadily for a couple of months and It has rapidly gone down hill. The rolls fall apart when you try to eat them. Forget prompt service if there are more than a couple of customers. There all you can eat  apparently mean as much as you can until the chef gets tired of making rolls for you. I went on a Sunday afternoon around 2PM hardly anyone in there, and was banned for life because I ordered too many rolls. When I asked for an explanation I was told that it was to much food for the all you can eat price they charge. The Waitress has always been nice, but the Chef has a real crappy attitude. I have several friends that also visited Sushi Wow who will no longer eat there. I case your curious I always order 8 rolls over the course of an hour and have always over tipped until today."}
{"text":"So yummy! I'm glad my girlfriend and I decided to try this place out. We live on a side of town that doesn't offer too many sushi options and we had been to all the other locations within our area, so we decided to take the risk and go here. Risks are sometimes worth taking!  

AYCE, you have to do it. Although they have a pretty good half off rolls Happy hour also. Either way you can't go wrong because the prices are very decent. Anyway, back to the yum stuff! 

We did AYCE and tried from: 

Appetizers: Seafood Salad ( so good we ordered another) / Baked Mussels ( I always rave about sushi kaya and typically I'll return to a sushi restaurant based on two things: freshness of the fish and the baked mussels, now I don't have to drive down the 15 and be stuck in that traffic, because Sushi Wow has some friggin bomb mussels!) / Stuffed Shrimp / Stuffed Jalapeños (these were better than the shrimp) / Dynamite Salad ( so creamy and delicious ) 

Rolls: Stuffed Tomato (the bomb and rice less) / Rock and Roll ( rice less) / Kiss of Fire (spicy)  / Las Vegas ( deep fried) / Forever 21 ( second fave) 

We might've had more, but those were the ones that came to mind. 

Our server was sweet and very attentive. She recommended a few of our rolls, so thank you! The sushi chefs were great! Their rolls, obviously, did not go uneaten. Thank you Chefs. Female and Male Chefs working that day.  

We will definitely be back. You're so close to home and we are so happy for that !"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been trying different sushi places around town to find our go-to spot and we just found it! Not only was the sushi really good, the chefs and waitress make it a good time! Our waitress was super friendly and funny. She saw my friend struggling with chopsticks and she went and made my friend some cheater chopsticks She also kept checking up on us which i really liked because at other AYCE places, sometimes it's so hard to track a waiter down to order more food. Given, it wasn't that busy in there when we went, but it was still impeccable service! The chefs were joking around, making conversation with us even though we weren't sitting at the sushi bar! They asked us what kind of fish we liked and made special plates for us which was awesome! Now, I know you're thinking \"ya'll paid for all you can eat, it's not like it's free plates of food\"...I KNOW. BUT, it's the thought that counts! They went out of their way to ask our preferences and made something they thought we'd like. I wish I got everyone's name...but we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom, we were the only ones in there.

Both my mom and I ordered the lunch boxes. She got the salmon box which includes tempura shrimp and vegetables, rice, salad & 4 pieces of california rolls. I got the Saba Yaki (Mackerel) including the same items as my mom. 

Overall, the food was great! Both the salmon and mackerel could've been a bit bigger but I cant complain too much the service was great and the price is good as well. I would definitely recommend it and I'd go back as well!"}
{"text":"The sushi roll tasted like nothing , no flavor. House salad was good. Miso soup was good too . Sushi didn't taste like there was any fish the best part of the sushi was the avocado. The rice on the sushi tasted dry. I wanted to try this place but was disappointed with sushi quality :("}
{"text":"We love this place. The sushi is fresh and insanely tasty. The ayce $23.95 lunch $24.95 dinner is wonderful. It's small and quant and they have a good selection of beer and wines too. Plentiful meals, in a dim lit atmosphere to really set the mood."}
{"text":"Great place! If you're in town staying at Aliante it's truly a hop,skip and a jump away from the hotel. It's just down the street and worth the short drive or uber. Great service, so much flavor, everyone is so kind and helpful.  This is a hidden gem !"}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat sushi but if you're a stickler for service unless you manage to beat everyone else there for dinner it will be a bit slow and not super accommodating but it's due to the severe lack of servers. The sushi is great and they have great house original rolls I would definitely recommend it for a low key all you can eat sushi place (comprehensive menu included in the AYCE) but again you'll have to be flexible and ready to chill out while you wait on the service and sushi preparation."}
{"text":"Very good customer focus. They recognize us from our previous visits. Awesome environment. Great sushi!!"}
{"text":"Holy Buckets! We didn't even get a picture of the rolls because we destroyed them in seconds! If you like sushi, you'd love this place! I HIGHLY recommend the Crunch Lobster Roll! Amazing service and fun ambience! I think I'm in love with this place!  I will definitely be back. It's so worth the drive north!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get fresh, great-tasting, all-you-can eat sushi in North Las Vegas. The service is great and the guys behind the sushi bar are superb at their trade. The rolls are delicious and the sushi is always fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a casual sushi lunch experience with friends."}
{"text":"Really surprised this place was good! The sushi was excellent. Their rolls don't look as good presentation wise but the flavor was there and that's all that matters to me. Awesome friendly staff ,service was quick. They have miso soup and also clam miso soup which was delicious! The only thing I didn't like was my lemonade, and although their ayce only 23.99 the total for two still came out to basically 60 with tip included which is they price we pay at other sushi bars. Still My girlfriend and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First visit since the change in ownership/management and I was happily surprised.  The restaurant grade is now an \"A\" and seems much cleaner with better vibes.  Got the AYCE for $24.  It is a good bargain.    

The fish was fresh and well-prepared, the hamachi (yellowtail) was especially tasty.  My deep fried items like tempura shrimp, soft shell crab, and fried calamari were hot, crispy and freshly battered.  My sushi chef, \"Marshall\", was friendly and easy-going and made sure I was never without food.  He makes a very nice hand roll.   

The waitresses are very attentive, friendly and charming and checked on me continuously throughout the meal.  My soda was refilled whenever it got low.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend & I went here just to try because we weren't near any of our usual places that we go to for sushi. The sushi here really ain't bad, the service was ok. I've only tried the Spicy chicken bento & the All you can eat. The bento was alright, there was nothing really special about the chicken though other than being spicy. It just tasted like bottled sauce that they used. Their spider crab roll was pretty good, but that's probably because I love that roll overall. What I disliked about this place was what you couldn't order on the all you can eat menu. Most of the items that my friend & I wanted wasn't what we could get. The waiter wouldn't let us get sweet shrimp, oysters, etc. just those little items that you could usually get at any other sushi place. He even said ice cream wasn't on the menu for all you can eat. I just couldn't believe it. I must've made an impression on how their menu sucked because he gave me ice cream at the end of our meal. Compared to other sushi places when it comes to all you can eat, it just wasn't worth it to eat here again."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in North Las Vegas... good location ,clean and nice staff... Everytime we go no wait unlike so other sushi spots in town .. and another post I've they have never been on dirty dining lol ... Hands down best sushi for the price ...there are hidden gems off of Las Vegas Blvd"}
{"text":"New management made so much difference! New menu, KPop, friendly staff, awesome sushi chefs, buy 2 drinks get 1 free, 90 min AYCE! Almost gave up on this place but now we will be regulars for sure. By far my (re)new(ed) favorite restaurant in NLV!

For a unique experience, ask the chefs to create off-menu rolls for you! Amaaaaazing!"}
{"text":"Second time here and enjoyed it just as much as the first. The sushi was really fresh and just as beautiful as it was delicious. Amazing staff and fun ambiance. There was a huge family that sat when we did and we still got our food fast."}
{"text":"Always our GO TOO sushi spot. It's close to home, the service is great, the food is even greater & the chefs along with the waitresses are even amazing! We have been coming here for years & the place has definitely progressed & reached success through out the years. We are never let down when we come here. 

From the appetizers to the nigiri, & of course the sushi rolls everything we've had has been tasty & never disappointing.  

Our favorites are; Yellowtail, Garlic Tuna, Super White, Lisa Lisa, Dragon, Crazy Boy, Hawaiian Tuna, Japanese Lasagna & you cant go wrong with the appetizers. 

They do get busy around dinner time as expected they also have 50% happy hour all day on all rolls!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service always consistent. Love Choi he's always plesent..go at least 3 times a month for the ayce and it's always delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves good food and fast service"}
{"text":"Great sushi creations. Love the pricing. And the K pop videos.

Their noodles dishes are really good too. Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Holy Hell I will never go back here again! ok here is how it went we waited for about 15 mins there was a total of 9 people there. it wasn't that much going on. well i ordered our food it was good for a price that is not reasonable. I normally go to china town or a real sushi restaurant if I'm going to eat at one. well the point is i spent about 80.00 and I didn't like the service the woman never would come back and to fill our drinks and when she gave us our food it was not complete our order was wrong and we spent more time there than we should have. I didn't tip because of her lag time on serving and no apology for her mistakes. we paid our bill and left but get this the woman ran out and said to me did you like your food. i said yes but you made a lot of mistakes and i didn't like staying here that long. she said to me \" you like food you give me tip\" ! I was so confused i told her i don't tip bad service i tip good service. she said i work on tips i told her i do too! but you are wrong to chase me out the restaurant and tell me to give you a tip. i will never come here again. i called the owner they didn't see a problem with what she did. even knowing what the services was like. so over all this place is slow too slow and shitty employees and owner! i would tell anyone don't go here but try at your own risk of being chased down for a tip. JUST GO TO SURU BBQ there open till 2:30am and it's all you can eat buffet its better then your near buy sushi wow crap! REMEMBER SURA BBQ KOREAN BBQ AND SUSHI JUST GO! OR kRAZY BUFFET"}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday at Sushi Wow and it was amazing. We had a party of 10 people and were taken care of promptly. Service was great, food was out of this world (as always)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this business. They are such a hit or miss with their service. And still they are so close to us and the food is so good, we keep going back. 

So since my last review we decided to give them another chance. We went back and the same girl was working there, this time she was the angel falling from heaven. Of course it is one Ahi Poki PER PERSON, and not how she told us the last time PER TABLE. I don't get it... And she was sooo nice, it was almost unreal. Food was good as always. Perfect. 

Then we went there one more time after that, there was some other girl. She had the worst attitude ever I have seen in a waitress. It was like she is purposely ignoring us.  Oh man, we were so frustrated. 

Really wish they would offer more consistent good service. I'm just so confused."}
{"text":"I knocked a star off.  Last time I went the fish was just not fresh.  I had All-You-Can Eat and they served salmon roe that was just horrible.  It's like the don't taste their own food.  If a sushi place can not serve the freshest food there is a huge problem.  I eat a lot of sushi.  Right now I am ranking this place at the bottom.  Sorry.  No soup for you.  6 Months."}
{"text":"All you can eat is off the chain...I literally ate over $50 dollars worth of food just now...Happy hour is worth it also, if you aren't up to the all you can eat...they have plenty of choices to pick from....a must is the tuna poke salad, and one of my favorites would be the shrimp tempura or the shrimp fried rice...whatever you choose to eat, you won't be disappointed....this is our 6th time going..."}
{"text":"My friends and I had been talking about going out for sushi after work and they recommended Sushi Wow. The sushi was good but the service is horrible. I arrived at approximately 5:30pm. My friends had arrived about 5 minutes earlier. The waitress had already started their order. I ordered a small appetizer and two rolls and she walked away before I could finish my order. My sushi came out, they set it on the table, and quickly left. I ate my sushi and chatted with my friends and figured they were busy. I had to get the waitresses attention and asked for a soda and an additional roll. The sushi came out quickly again but the waitress was not attentive to our table. We finished, paid the bill, and were wrapping the conversation when they asked us to leave so they can seat other people. We were only there about an hour and we our bill was decent sized and we tipped well. Under no circumstances do you ask customers who pay a decent amount and tip you to leave so you can turn tables. By the way there were plenty of empty seats, the sushi bar was mostly empty. The food was not that phenomenal that you can treat customers this way."}
{"text":"I miss this place.

I lived in NLV for several years and couldn't go more than a week without going by. The food was always top notch and the staff was amazing, even over the course of years and turn over there was always friendly and helpful people there serving and making some of the best tasting rolls I ever experienced. It's the place I would bring my out of town friends, and they always wanted to back for more. I've never understood why this place wasn't rates better on Yelp as it was always crowded with a lively crowd. Don't miss out on the Wow Wow Wow roll!!!!"}
{"text":"I found a good AYCE sushi place, it is not to far from my house. They have 50 % off everyday for lunch ( 11am-3pm) for sushi rolls. The server & the sushi chef are really friendly.
As far for AYCE  ($23.99 all day everyday) to bad you only can order whole order , half order only for last call.
 I don't eat sashimi so it doesn't effect me but for sashimi lover out there, all sashimi are NOT INCLUDE in AYCE.
They have a bento plate dishes.
Anyway they have a truly good food there. A must to order soft shell crab , ultimate shrimp roll,  crunch lobster roll.
I will definitely come back so I can try other rolls
PS: I forgot to take a pictures because I was so excited to dig in my sushi"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it's in the neighborhood - BAD DECISION!  I ordered a california roll and philadelphia roll just to test them out.  I ate a bite of each, and then left. The rolls were not round, but an oblong shape and the rice did not go around to the bottom.  The tuna was not a vibrant color and had fatty white throughout.  It had a strong fishy taste to it - not fresh.  If you have high food standards, especially for sushi, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Staff were very friendly. Overall good customer service, but the food was horrible :( everything seem to be precooked, nothing was fresh. Everything I ordered taste exactly like the pre- made ones at the grocery store. I ordered mostly hot sushi, but every rolls was cold, the rice and the sea-weed wrappers were very stiff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The sushi isn't top quality but it's good for a cheap sushi date. They have 1/2 off rolls everyday for dine in only and it's awesome to get good sushi for cheap. The staff is always so friendly and inviting it's very comforting even so I come here by myself just to have some sushi and beer and unwind a little and I will continue to do so! This place is over all 10/10 for me"}
{"text":"Perfection.  Chef Sarah, chef choi, and chef k are amazing. From appetizers to bento boxes to the sushi and special rolls; it's all made fresh to order. I have been to many sushi bars, and this one is by far one of my tops. Most of the customers are regulars,  once you go there you will keep going back. After the first few times going all of the staff will treat you like family. They have 6 tables and avout 12 bar seats, you get to choose to sit wherever is the most comfortable for you. But no matter where you choose to sit you get the same great service. My favorite is sitting at the bar seats. That way you get the opportunity to talk directly with the chefs!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi 1/2 every roll all day ery day dine in or all you can eat. But what makes it better is the chefs and staff every time is a great experience."}
{"text":"Good stuff. All you can eat was a good deal. Sushi was good. Rice was rolled nicely thin, so the rolls weren't mostly rice. Nice. My friends had bento boxes, and they dug them also. Good place."}
{"text":"Best food, Best Service in Las Vegas!!! The Best Sushi place i have ever been to..
Highly recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for horrible quality!!! We usually don't like trying new sushi places for just this reason, we got simple things like Korean Bbq bento and chicken Katsu bento... BBQ bento was ok, the chicken Katsu was horrible I mean it's not hard to screw up chicken Katsu... The crab/Cali roll tasted sour, the soy sauce was the worse I've ever encountered like where did they get that from, the rice was hard we paid $40 for 2 bentos and 6cali rolls worse way to spend $40.... Save your money and go else where now we know better!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it.  The sushi was really good. But their customer services was even better.  My little niece who is five wanted to try a roll. I order shrimp tempura roll and she love it.  They even cut the pieces in half so she can eat them.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The chef was amazing. All my taste bud were alive and dancing! Let the chef guide you. Started with a wow and ended with the Lucy! Omg the flavors in between! Kiss of fire had my lips burning but so good! Throughly enjoyable! Bookmarked for my next visit!"}
{"text":"We found our offical sushi spot!!! Loved all the dishes!!! The chef specialty sushi dishes were full of flavor. The service was quick and excellent. The main chef was very friendly. She came to greet us and asked about the service. She told us she was very happy to create dishes that made us delighted. I highly recommend Sushi Wow!!! 
Thank u Sushi Wow for the yummy food, service and hospitality We'll for sure be back for more."}
{"text":"I have been coming here every once in a while for years. I have always like their california roll crunch (my favorite roll), but because of the bad service I did not find myself coming to eat here very often. I went the the other night and from what I remember they did not close till 11 on weekends, but when we came in they just look at me and my boyfriend like weridos. I did not know they changed the hours and still don't when we went in the place still looked like they were open, so we said hi. They did not respond back till like ten seconds later they tell us that they are closed. I thought it was rude of them to not say hi back and to not be nice overall all. Although it was the first time that I saw these two employees, the main boss or manager I usually do see was not there. Next time I go I'll go earlier because overall their sushi is good, especially the dinner box or lunch box, hopefully I do not see those rude employees. 
I could understand that they might of closed early that night or something and they wanted to go home. It is just common courtesy to say hi back and not give customers a weird stare."}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighborhood for two years and I've dined at Denny's which is next door to Sushi Wow and never really paid any attention to it and I don't know why. WELL.......what a pleasant surprise for me and now you. From the moment you make the Door jingle as you walk in you are greeted with a resounding \"HELLO\"
I got a very homey and comfortable feeling as I took in the ambiance. Sushi Wow is small by comparison but huge when it comes to service and of course the colorful display of fresh fish in any style you want it. I went for the all you can eat (AYCE) for all you novices. I was like a prize fighter vying for the gold sushi eating belt in my division. I asked and received everything in a nice presentation and with always a smile. I suggest you make a trip to the outskirts of Las Vegas and head North to SUSHI WOW for a great dining experience coupled with great service with a smile."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best Sushi that I've ever had in Las Vegas; and you cannot beat their prices! The servers and chefs are amazing as well! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!! I just discovered it about a month ago and I love it. There sushi is soooo fresh. The staff is amazing! The only thing that sucks is they don't do half rolls unless it's your last roll which sucks. But other than that I recommend the Shawn's and the 007!!!"}
{"text":"If you are reading this to decide whether or not you want to go to eat here....I would definitely NOT recommend it....I just bought a bento box and I found a HAIR in my food...I brought this to the attention of the OWNER and he brushed me off....he said he could make me a new box....Now tell me why I would want another box of HAIR covered tempura.....I obviously declined that ridiculous offer and demanded my money back....HE LAUGHED IN MY FACE....saying that it was not possible......So if you are looking for a good sushi place DO NOT enter this establishment....You should instead go to Kaizen sushi because it has great service and does not serve HAIR COVERED FOOD.... If i could I would give them a negative five rating....."}
{"text":"This place has super yummy roles and bento boxes.
They are Korean owned and they spice up the roles nicely.
If you get the Wow Wow Wow role or the Wow Special, you will want to get the sauce on the side, as it will overpower the role.
Like with any sushi place, you have to try everything and figure out what your own favorites are.
They just started an all you can eat on Monday nights.
If you read one of the reviews below, someone complained it's not the entire menu, and there is an hour limit. Well, if you go to ANY sushi bar that also has an all you can eat option, there is always an hour limit and a limited menu. If you love roles, this is the place to go. If you prefer traditional sushi, this may not be the place for you. Sushi Tachi just up the street at Centennial/Simmons by the Gold's gym has an all you can eat (limit 1 hr, and limited menu), that is good for nigiri type sushi (piece of fish on top of rice)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here! It's super convenient for us when we are craving for sushi. The two sushi chefs are awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to find this place randomly and have been going back to it over and over again. The food is fresh and delicious, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We discovered Fuji Apple Sake (so yummy!) thanks to our waitress, and Chef Choi is just a really great guy. He promotes a family atmosphere, which I love. The prices are also decent. Overall, this place deserves every star. Thanks for another awesome dining experience, Sushi Wow!"}
{"text":"Really nice Sushi joint! We had about 8 different rolls and they were all pretty good. The price is probably the best thing about this place, they have 50% off all their rolls from open to close all seven days of the week! I recommend visiting this joint if you are in the north side of town. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best sushi around! Great service and delicious food. My son and I eat there at least once a week, yum!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kim is SOO friendly and creative, he WOW'd us with special items he thought we would like, like the seared pepper tuna! It was so amazingly fresh and tasty! Ry was the most helpful and sweet server. She helped with recommendations based on your individual tastes. If I could take a picture I would post it. Believe me, this is the BEST place for sushi and fun. 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously don't go here. Me and my husband went here to try it...and we left right away. Reason reason we left right away was because the sushi chef was blowing his nose, and then he rinses his hands under water without any soap and just wipe his hands on his apron dips his hands into the sushi rice and started to make a roll. How freaking disgusting is that. When the roll came in front of us we told the sushi chef about him not washing his has we left because we were so disgusted. go here if you like boogers in your sushi. totally on hygienic place to eat at"}
{"text":"It took me a while to try out Sushi Wow, but I was quite pleased when I did. The fish seemed fresher and more substantive than some of the other places in NLV I've tried. Price-wise, it was cheap for what you get. There is a HUGE assortment of rolls, appetizers, some great priced lunches. The service has been solid and friendly the few times I've been thus far. 

All in all, one of the better sushi joints in NLV."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Food is fresh, definitely worth ypur money. Only drawback is they did last call for orders 30 minutes before closing so go early."}
{"text":"This place has great tasting sushi but is waaaaaay overpriced for the amount/size you get. I just don't feel that an 8 piece roll that has pieces the size of a quarter is worth $13?? The staff was super friendly, fresh fish, the whole 9 yards but they need to come down on their prices for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"Revised review:
Waitress was very good, quick and very knowledgeable. Suggested items we haven't tried before. Made this dining experience better and the fish tasted better too...


Enjoyed the sushi (minus the hamachi kama - no bueno) but paying $12 AYCE for my 5 year old who had tempura shrimp and miso soup was unjustifiable. No kids meal on the menu either while next door offers kids eat free - might be good to consider options for families since I noticed there were 2 other parties with children - kids bento perhaps? I'm sure it'll populate revenue..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The worst customer service EVER!!! Wanted to order a salad on top of what we already ordered and waiter declined in a very rude tone of voice and manner. On top of that he threatened to kill us because we walked out. NEVER going back! Make the drive to other areas in town to get better quality food and service. 
I'm only giving it one star because I have to. If I could, I would rate it negative stars."}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious and if it weren't for the fact that we couldn't breathe I am pretty sure we would still be ordering.

And the service was amazing. Both ladies tonight were super friendly and very helpful. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"New to the area & have found my new sushi place. Excellent service, food, atmosphere. The Shawn is my fav roll but everything we tried was delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, love the wow wow wow, crunch lobster, forever 21 and more. I love the Korean BBQ bento box too. Everybody's very friendly."}
{"text":"Simply awful! We went in and were given a table that was still dirty. Then we were given sticky menus. Next we noticed the holes in the cushions and dirty floors as we waited for our waters. We got the waters and one of the glasses had lipstick on it from a previous customer. We told the waiter no thanks and left right away. Luckily there are several restaurants next door and  a far better sushi bar up the road a little so we did not go hungry. No offense to friends who swear by this place but I needed a shower and multiple hand washings after visiting this dump. I don't know if the food is any good but I sure wasn't going to risk obvious food poisoning to find out!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at this place, I ordered the salmon nigiri and it still had pin bones, which I was just able to remove and didn't say anything, but than my husbands water had a roach and that was my breaking point.. I will never go back the quality of the fish is not fresh. Everyone has their own experience but me personally will never come back."}
{"text":"The waiter is rude..there's 1 hr limit..that hr includes you consuming your food.  It should be an hr of ordering and give you another hr to finish whatever you ordered. If you have a a big group, one hr is not enough..eat, chat, eat etc.. Not only was he rude but he told us to finish ASAP bec we were 20 mins over the hr and he will charge us full price for our leftover if we don't finish in addition to the buffet price! Full price for quarter bowl of fried rice and 2 sushi rolls? Give me a break! He's telling us to wrap it up like there's a line for ppl to eat! There was nobody there but me and 4 other girls. Certainly not coming back here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because I just walked in with my mother n daughter asked for the all-u-can eat and the waiter says \"make sure you cannot share anything\"...no shit Sherlock...."}
{"text":"Definitely my least favorite sushi restaurant due to quality of their food. First off my hot tea was lukewarm. Ordered about 5 orders of salmon and was very underwhelmed when it came to my table. The fish was cut poorly and the rice tasted a little overcooked and old. The tuna in the poke salad still tasted a bit frozen and had a crunch to it. 

After trying a couple more rolls I was a bit done with the food and was looking forward to dessert. Sadly mochi ice cream was only served for dinner. For the price that I paid, it definitely wasn't worth it. 

My server though was definitely nice and kept tending to our orders with a smile. If it wasn't for her, I would've given this place one star."}
{"text":"Back again today. Delicious as always. We always have the same waitress, she know all my kids names, which roles we each like, and asks about where the kids are (at school). It's not like were constantly here. About once a month, but it's always her and she is such a sweet heart."}
{"text":"I've probably come here at least 10 times now, and I really do love it. However, there is one secret you must follow to get the best service: Go at an off time on a weekday. For example, go at 4:00 on a Tuesday. Why? Because it's like having your personal sushi chef because nobody else is in the restaurant. I did make the mistake of coming here on a Saturday night, and it was crowded and understaffed. Nothing worse than waiting 20 minutes between rolls. They used to have a $19.95 AYCE lunch menu until 3:00 PM, but now it's a straight $24.95 at all times I believe."}
{"text":"Server took order wrong then tried blaming me saying I didn't tell her. Only  received 1 of the 3 item I ordered. Server finally came back to the table and asked if I was still waiting on something and I said yes the other 2 things I ordered I said it they hadn't started them I didn't want them I had already waited over 40 minutes and there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant. She tried saying I didn't order the fried rice I told her I did and she even repeated the order back to me. Then when I went to pay she tried to charge me for everything I said I never received those items and she said oh you didn't? Keep in mind the same person took my order told the cooks my order brought me 1 item of my food heard my complaints and still acted like I hadn't told her anything before. One of the other workers I believe the manager took over and told me my total. It seemed high so I asked for the receipt he handed it to me, I then pointed out he over charged me for one of my husbands items by 3$. Needless to say worse service ever and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat. Everything we had was really fresh and yummy. Had Japanese music videos on. Wierd but entertaining. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. I always go here so they start making my sushi as soon as I walk in. It's a small place but everyone here is friendly. Fresh fish, good variety and good service. Try Shawn's roll, Wow special, adios amigo from the AYCE menu. Not part of the AYCE: screaming orga$m."}
{"text":"Tonight four of us went to eat at Sushi Wow. I can not express enough how amazing the food was. We all ordered the All-You-Can-Eat, and between us all, we had 18 rolls! Some of my favorites were the Lisa Lisa, Wow Wow Wow, the Yellowtail Arizona, Tiger, Dragon, Screaming Orgasm.... The mussels were also super tasty! I read the reviews and for two days was apprehensive about going. I am extremely picky and a ambiance snob. I am a career server and my husband is a manager of a competing restaurant to my own. We also are from Florida and know all about FRESH fish. I have never ate better or more raw fish in my life. Delicious!!!! The portions were huge, more than I can get in one bite! The sushi was beautifully plated, the restaurant was immaculately clean, even the bathroom, the server never let our drinks get empty (And I had tea and beer), there was never an empty plate or trash left on the table. All I can say is that anyone posting poor reviews on the food or the service were probably rude, inexperienced, self deserving people. This is by far the best of the five places I have tried in Vegas and am definitely returning! WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome gem spot! Cool prices, excellent sushi & friendly staff. My new spot! S/O to Chef Choi, Penny & Charlie u guys rock! Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! High quality sushi with incredible selection. I'm a regular and i love coming here at least twice a month. 

They treat my family with sincere care. We're usually a large group and they always accommodate. 

I have a 9month old who loves their miso soup. 

The aj special is the best but if you'd like the full experience of great sushi,  SIT AT THE BAR! 

Do some sake bombs and enjoy their great selection. 

Thank you guys for always making it a WOW EXPERIENCE!!!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a fantastic AYCE lunch here with a friend... The food was AMAZING, I recommend the vampire roll!! The only thing better than the food was the service. The manager was our chef and she knocked it out of the park!!! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I am from Reno where AYCE is not only abundant, but incredibly fair priced and delicious. My fiancé  and I have been trying to find the best all you can eat sushi in Vegas, and we may have just found it. 
The rolls were good size, the customer service was awesome, the food came out super fast, and we liked the variety. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is most definitely one of if not THE TOP Sushi Place:

- fresh & tasty food 
- great value \"all you can eat sushi'
- 2 chefs Choi & Kim cook equally perfect
- Ry from any place in the US (North Carolina, Idaho, California or now Vegas) is taking best care of you

Awesome place to go"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened & I have found that this is the best place to get sushi in North Las Vegas. Must eats: Lisa Lisa, Dragon, Bulgoki bento, & so much more. They also just started a new special: Happy hour after 9pm, More than two ppl all you can eat (great for parties) which includes free beer/sake on first order. WOOP!"}
{"text":"Get place! The food was good. They offered happy hour vs ayce, which is great. The spicy spider and Lexi special we're our favs. The staff was very attentive, not annoying. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a great lunch experience."}
{"text":"The hubby and I love coming here. Chefs are great and fun and very attentive. They have happy hour all day and an all you can eat menu. The wow wow wow roll is one of my faves."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  I just moved here from the bay area and wanted some sushi. I tired three places near my job but didn't like them one bit... I read the reviews for Sushi Wow and also looked at the stars, which made me leery. However, I decide to go. 
Glad I did the entire staff greeted me when I walked in very warming. They have an all you can eat option along with half off prices, for those like me who can't exceed two rolls  The offer is for all day, 7 days a week by the way..

I had the vampire roll and the kiss of fire, yummy.. I have officially found a sushi spot, I plan to try other items on the large menu that they have.. If you are wondering if you should give them a try, let me help you.. Go check them out.

Nor the bay area but if your in the north try them out.."}
{"text":"Woooowwwwww indeed! This place is delicious and AYCE! They have an amazing happy hour offering half off rolls  but we want with the AYCE instead. We had cucumber salad, muscles (baked and soooo good), and put stickers. All of which were delicious!! Penny was our server and she was so sweet, funny and attentive. The sushi chef was really nice too! So happy to have found this restaurant on yelp because it's nice and close to where we live. Definitely a favorite place!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends on a Saturday at 1130am for AYCE at $23.99 per person. The place was empty and freshly mopped. I don't know about other people, but I love the smell of bleached cleanliness, and that's what it was. There was only the one server there at this time, and she was extremely friendly and attentive. We ordered many different rolls, including lobster bake, Japanese lasagna, lisa lisa, and sooo many more. They were all delicious. They were so good that I didn't even need the added flavor of soy sauce. 

I didn't have a good experience with the take-out rolls (lisa lisa and Japanese lasagna) that I ordered some months ago; they were small and disappointing. Then I read pretty bad reviews on here. I was skeptical about going, but my friends love the place. Now, I'm extremely happy with this place and glad that I went. I won't order take-out again, but I will definitely go back for AYCE. I just went yesterday and am resisting the temptation to go back again today."}
{"text":"The second visit in two days and I kept my promise to check out their AYCE special. I am a Minnesota Grandmother who has frequented 3 sushi bars in the last few months in North Las Vegas. This restaurant is small, charming, and engaging with the waitstaff ready with recommendations. The sushi chefs are the friendliest around with great attention to detail! My grandson and I think this has the best atmosphere of all the sushi places with Korean videos and even a quiet baseball game playing on an overhead monitor. The beer is cold and the soft drinks are kept full and crisp. Rolls are delicious with a page of their most popular (in pictures) right in the front of the menu. We had tempera vegetables to start with a lobster roll. WONDERFUL to say the least. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed...tell them the Minnesota Grandma says, \"Hi\""}
{"text":"Food was good. We went on a Saturday so it was busy, only one server. Not your authentic sushi place. White mistake roll and crab lover were the only two that I enjoyed. All together we tried 20 different things."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had the best time eating incredibly diverse specialty rolls and dishes here! Sushi chef Penny is fantastic! Tons of fun! There were surprised for both our taste buds as well as the creativity. 5 stars without a doubt!! Highly recommend this sushi wow!"}
{"text":"The Shawn's roll is the best. Great inexpensive prices. Great customer service, workers all have smiles."}
