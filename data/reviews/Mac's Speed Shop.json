{"text":"When you come here, stick to what matters and don't deviate.

The brisket and ribs are fantastic.
The pork is very good.

The chicken is not my favorite
The sides are pretty good overall - Mac n' Cheese is very good.

Hush puppies are excellent."}
{"text":"Looking for a good place for some BBQ and I thought I should try this place out. On top of everything the food was great! The only reason I give it three stars would be the lack of good friendly service, other than that though it was a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Went last night.  Waited for quite some time near bar for a server but they stood around chatting with each other versus helping us.  The greeter walked past us numerous times after she seated us but never checked in or got our server for us.  We ended up walking out.  It was very interesting to see the greeter & someone dressed in a bright pink shirt watch us leave without being served & never even attempted to fix it.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Great food. Even better service. The Manager is friendly & helpful. I love the smoked chicken nachos. Great outdoor live music and a great happy hour crowd!"}
{"text":"I recommend the BBQ here, as I didn't have any meat that wasn't tender. However, I prefer the sauce heated and mixed into my pulled BBQ, and found it a little bland on its own. They do offer several different kinds of sauces on the side, and this offers diversity, but heating the sauce with the meat really makes a flavor difference. The ribs were fantastic just the way they come!

I also really enjoyed their chili! They offer an option to serve the chili with cheese and other toppings, which is great with tortilla chips as an appetizer.

Unfortunately, the sides were not great. My brother in law is known for cooking a full pig every few months, and my large Southern family really brings it with the sides, so perhaps I am just partial :) I must say, after trying the greens, beans, fries, slaw, potato salad, and mac and cheese, I was a bit disappointed. The mac and cheese was dry; the greens were too salty and not vinegary at all, the slaw was not very sweet or creamy, and the fries were a little over cooked. The beans and potato salad were good. :) 

This was not my favorite BBQ stop because of the sides, which is one of my favorite parts of a BBQ place, and the \"unsauced\" pulled meat. Also, they do not offer fried okra, which I feel is a necessary staple.

The beer selection is quite good, with several local options. Also, they have live music frequently and a good size patio. These elements combine into a great happy hour or evening location!

Overall, try it out for the meat, beer selections, and the ambiance. Though I grew up in NC, by no means am I a BBQ expert, and this is simply my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Mac's Speed Shop succeeds where so many pretenders fail.  If I really knew why I would use the secret to open my own restaurant.  Nothing here is authentic Carolina BBQ.  And yet BBQ flavors and sides permeate the experience, and everything I have eaten here has been hearty and has been good.   It feels enough like a \"biker car\" to folks like me who have never actually been in a real biker bar to be fun."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and many different beer choices. My wife and I split the combo platter which was a full meal for the two of us. All the BBQ was outstanding. The staff was attentive and friendly. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food, typically fast service. Great menu that is reasonably priced.  Definitely a relaxed atmosphere plenty of motorcycle parking right up front."}
{"text":"Friday night and we can't get any tv's changed. Apparently something wrong with wifi or manager has no clue how to change. Big bar, lots of people and no control over tv's. Never heard that in a \"bar\" or \"restaurant\". Hope our food is good soon. Or more to come"}
{"text":"Love their honey BBQ wings. I gave them 4 stars because their service is kind of slow at all times"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING drove for 45 min and will do it many times more great food the mac and cheese along with the baked beens best i've ever had...If getting Brisket get sandwich instead of plate much better."}
{"text":"Best Carolina BBQ joint I have been to yet! The vinegar based Carolina BBQ sauce is great. Hush puppies were fried to perfection. Also, tons of craft beer in cans, bottles and draft if that's what you are into!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the waitress. staff was awesome, but I never go back for the sole reason of they charge 12.00 for a Long Island!!! Are you serious?!  No drink in cornelius NC is that good."}
{"text":"We have driven pass this place multiple times. It always looked fun and crowded from the outside. We finally had time to stop by recently, and were pleasantly surprised with the food. They give you free hush puppies, which were amazing! We got a BBQ platter with pulled pork, ribs, sausage with sides of onion rings and Brunswick stew. The pulled pork was very flavorful. I really enjoyed it, and I'm not even a big pulled pork person. The Brunswick stew was super tasty. My mouth waters when I think of it. The ribs and sausage were okay, but nothing special. We sat at a high table near the bar in the open patio area. Overall, I really liked the place, and will definitely be back. The only negative is that we ordered another BBQ platter to go, and asked for some hush puppies to go with it, and got charged I  think $1.50 for it. It's nothing to fuss about, but I think it's better for the waitress to mention the charges in advance, to avoid any potential negative feelings."}
{"text":"A review from the vegetarians eye: I was deeply worried to enter an establishment specializing in \"pulled pork\" based on all the pig pickings I was forced to attend since my time here in the south . In any sense cooked pig are 2 words enough to send any non carnivore eating folk running. Our group ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and I can say the fried pickles give the penguin a run for their money. The breading was spicy yet crispy and ranch dip was not of the hidden valley variety. Deli-sh! I was pleased to see several choices available not containing meat aka salads. There were 4 salads you could add meat or fish to if desired. I bet if requested a black bean burger could be added atop your choice mountain of greens instead of a slab of meat. I ordered the spinach salad minus the bacon with blackened tilapia and poppy seed vinaigrette. The salad was pretty good but I thought the fish was way over-seasoned for my palette. Aka so salty it was difficult to taste the fish itself. In addition to salads a selection of 3 or 4 vegetables can be chosen as a main course as well. Both the mac n cheese  (stole a bite from my friend's plate- shh don't tell) and green bean casserole were tasty ( not as good as mine in my opinion but three stars good). There was live music outside and the atmosphere was festive but probably not nearly as festive as the south boulevard location so I hear. Our server was attentive to our 10 party group and I really liked the relaxed environment. I will definitely come back again and get a black bean burger instead of fish. Another order of those spicy fried pickles will also be on the list!"}
{"text":"Overall just meh.  The Cons - Our appetizers came out 2 minutes after our meals. Kinda defeated the whole purpose.  Plus the Brunswick stew and some of the sides were only a bit more than room temperature.  The creamed corn just tasted a bit off.  It had a weird bitter taste initially, then a sweet taste.  I'm from the south so I know my creamed corn well enough to know it was bad.  Half way through eating they also dimmed the lights so much at like 7pm on a weeknight we could barely see our food.  Another thing was it was too loud for the day and time.  The waitress even said a few times how loud it was and she couldn't hear really well when we ordered.  I'm in my late 20s and I get the fact it's a bar kinda as well.  But too dim and loud for my liking to eat dinner.  The Pros - Really good sausages, BBQ, and baked macaroni and cheese.  In fact I LOVE the macarroni and cheese and I'm pretty sure that's about the only reason I would go back.  Just give me a large side of that - to go!"}
{"text":"Service was fine. Food was not. My friend ordered the Brunswick Stew. Very little meat in it and not seasoned at all. I ordered the Mac Chilli with all fixins. It didn't look too appetizing, was room temperature and had no meat in it; just a bunch of beans and tomatoes. I asked the server and she shrugged and said \"They must have not stirred it before dipping it out\". Quickly, after sorta finishing it, my stomach started to feel weird. I came home and laid down. It got worse. Eventually, I threw it up -- tomatoes and beans. Beware the chili."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 4/11/15 for a group outing with co-workers. The service was great but the food was horrible. I ordered the St louis style ribs, these ribs were smoked too much that it took the flavor away from the taste of the pork. Needless to say I got very sick  because the food disagreed with my stomach bad stomach pains and vomiting all night. I had better BBQ before, all of my co-workers basically left the majority of their food on the plate."}
{"text":"We took a break off the bike and had good sandwiches  ( pulled pork Cuban and a BBQ chicken ) for lunch and enjoyed a cold beer. Tonya our bartender was AWESOME .. We will definitely be coming back. Looking forward to checking out Bike Nites in the spring."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I have had in Charlotte. There beer list is extensive and they have great specials.  Overall it is not that expensive especially for what you get.  The times I have been there it seems to be a great environment.  It is set up as a biker bar but is a great place for anyone to go."}
{"text":"Received an incredibly soggy pulled pork sandwich. How I asked myself? I had just received it and the bottom of the bun was already tearing apart! Wings were minuscule and dry."}
{"text":"Skip the BBQ, get the beer can chicken. A half or quarter of chicken roasted on top of a beer can. Great with the different sauces and fixins. All of their sides--mac and cheese and green bean caserole--were delicious. A little bit of a culture shock--Lake Norman preps with khakis rolling up in their Lexus to a biker joint, but great food non-the-less."}
{"text":"avoid the liquor drinks...very weak...good beer though

Comet Grille has much better pours on their liquor."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints - the service is always pretty quick, and the food itself is always delicious.  Last night I got the smoked turkey with mac and cheese and tried the green bean casserole for the first time.  All of it was great! And it's a generous portion size too, so you won't leave hungry at all.  I also love their beer selection. 

On saturday nights they have live music and it was a very chill laid back atmosphere - lots of people even brought their dogs with them to the patio. I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Gone there now 6 times. Twice we had good service. Once the day they opened and once on an evening right before closing. The food is good if you like smoky barbeque but the portions and meals are inconsistent. The service is overall terrible. The waitstaff we experienced were rude, forgetful, incorrect and don't  give a damn about customer service. They don't know their menu, beers, and seem to rushed to take the time to find out. Overall we collectively rate Macs a two for decent food but we are over it. 
Next time in Matthews we will go back to Moes, city barbeque or eat from pita grill across the street. Bye Macs."}
{"text":"I really want to love Macs but it is so hard. The food is hit and miss and more miss than not.  I have been coming here since they opened only because it is convenient to go from my office.  Beer selection is great, but the servers know almost nothing.  Ask them what  Lagers they have on draft and most of the time they stare at you wondering what a lager is.  A major pet peeve of mine is their hush puppies. ALWAYS soggy as if they had been sitting for hours.  It seems they cook them in giant batches early in the day and let them sit.  Their beef brisket is sometimes tender, but most of the time it is hard and dry, again, evidently sat there for hours in the open.  The chilly is offensive - my friend said it felt like spackle.  
Some things I've had better luck with. Their deviled eggs are always great and so is their pulled pork. I will probably continue coming h ere for the beer but I will have to be starving to keep running my chances with their food."}
{"text":"Lots of beers and great BBQ. Live music nights are usually pretty good. Service can be hit or miss, but it can be absolutely outstanding.

The \"little bit of stuff\" platter is my favorite. Don't let the name fool you. I'm known as a \"big eater\" and this fills me up!

Sleeper pick, try the Brunswick Stew as a side. It's a personal favorite."}
{"text":"The BBQ is very good here, as are the brisket and chicken.  Not the BEST BBQ in the area, but very good.  The sides are where they have it -- all of them are killer.  

Great environment and staff -- great place to hang out, watch a game, or listen to some live music!"}
{"text":"Would like to say I ate here but have attempted 2 times and both times there was NO parking, people walking in and walking right back out. Was dropped off to check in wanting to stay and it just smelled so bad of BBQ smoke that I just didn't want to stay and wait over 1 hr and stink like that. Don't think I will try again."}
{"text":"Really great food. Pork rinds brisket and pork. Tons of beers. Really loud. Not good for a conversation at dinner. Several attractive waitresses. Lots of tvs."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Servers are attentive, without being annoying. The food is really good - especially the onion rings and mac & cheese. Quick service!  They have indoor and outdoor seating and live bands outdoors on a regular basis. Last time we were there, the band even played songs for the kids in the audience to dance to. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had the Little Pig pulled pork sandwich with Brunswick Stew. Meh.  The bun was something you would buy at any grocery store. The BBQ pulled pork was OK.  Lots of craft beers on tap though.  Overall, nothing special."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I have ever had. My family truly enjoyed our food. We ended up at Mac's through review's and it was worth every penny. Thanks for the great food, wish you would open a Mac's in Chapel Hill..."}
{"text":"I should of stayed home and had cereal. I go out for BBQ only several times a year and I was really in the mood for good BBQ. Arrived and smelled smoke from the smoker out back of the restaurant.I was expecting great things. I ordered a lg BBQ sandwich and the portion size was just OK for $8/9 bucks. It came and was soaking wet and tasted as if it was pork potroast that had been boiling in water all day. No smoke flavor!! No real flavor AT ALL!! It wasen't bad but it had no taste. My friend had a luke cold burger and fries that were room temp. We couldn't figure out why anyone would eat here. Maybe it's the sports bar/nascar theme draw???Don't know if they had a really bad night or if this was their usual fare. I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and hang out. Their BBQ and wings are top notch! Food always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"The beer selection is outstanding, both bottles and draughts. Service is friendly but slow. The food varies, our friends ordered wings and loved them, the pimento cheese dip billed as spicy was quite bland. My biggest complaint, backless stools at the high top tables. Just not comfortable after an hour or so."}
{"text":"The BBQ plate was awesome !! Also had $5 martini night ..the bomb!!!! 
Most go and eat ...great sauces to choose from 
A lil noisy ..but other wise great atmosphere..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food however they have trouble getting the CORRECT meal out to the CORRECT patron. This is the third time I have been here and each time I have gotten the wrong meal with no apologies. So don't forget to double check your order with your server. I understand the first time but 3 times is excessive, especially since no alterations were made to the meal. Then to top it off, each time they ask do you want to order something else? Really? I want the meal I ordered. Definitely not patronizing this business anymore."}
{"text":"4 stars is about right ... It's good and we'll go back but not great.  I swear Mac's used to be better, before they became a \"chain\".  Seems like they lost their luster when their sauces went into prepackaged bottles.  Service was friendly and OK.  A little slow with the check which matters with young children (they get impatient and start bouncing off the walls).  It always seems a little loud but maybe I'm a prude. Kids did like the food though which gets a lot of points from us.  Solid 4!"}
{"text":"Well goodbye Macs.  I use to enjoy your place. I don't know  if it's the Matthews location or your food has become average. A group of us meet once a month in Matthews and I am constantly disappointed. Tonight was the final fork. 
Why you ask?
Impatient waitress ...listless attention span 
During the meal a cohort asked for something which never arrived 
Poor Guinness pour....arrived mostly foam
11 French fries  came with my meal also lukewarm  btw 
Mid size BBQ sandwich needed to be drenched in sauce for flavor...geez flavor your meat as it cooks don't rely on a  bottle of sauce   
BBQ had no smoked flavor.  
BBQ bun seemed stale...the bun was hard.
It was a total waste of a meal. The type where you eat aggravated thinking what a ripoff. And it was between the meal and service 

I would have mentioned my complaint but I was with my group. BUT ...when a manager walks by asking how are things and receives only mumbles he should have been more intuitive and delved into our lukewarm response.  I did say to my waitress I was underwhelmed but received nary a grunt. 

I don't recommend Macs if you are looking for real southern BBQ a la Louisane or Texas. 
It's ok but I ain't headin\" back."}
{"text":"The only positive thing was the free soda refill. The server was as sad as the food.  No personality on both accounts. Onion rings were old and stale; burger was raw and oily. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"Very thankful for Jason finding my purse and retuning it to me! Very appreciated. Great food and service as always!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional and speedy service even with a full restaurant at 8:30 on Saturday night. The hostess and waiter were very attentive. Our orders were delivered within 5 minutes after ordering (Wings VTX Chipotle & Dry rub, Onion rings and Chopper salad). 
The food was hot and flavorful and the salad crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"A very nice place to gather for lunch or dinner with the family or coworkers. They spent a lot of money to remodel and update the building. We have been here twice already and both times they didn't have the beer about 4 different kinds on the menu for order  Kind of disappointing.  The food is really good but to me a regular barbecue joint of the Carolinas."}
{"text":"Ok, heard that this was the best BBQ in Charlotte.  Went in for lunch and let the waitress recommend a lunch plate.  To this she said to have the pulled pork tacos.  Wow, I thought not your typical lunch plate.  I ordered that and a brisket taco.  This was a great choice and let the waitress know.  The place is must add to any stop in town."}
{"text":"I thought this was a biker's bar at first but all went well.   An extensive beer garden-like inventory.   The food was typical grill but very good and a decent value.   We had the bbq assortment"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mac's for years and find the quality going down.  The beef brisket is not good anymore.  I went to the Cornelius restaurant for take out of the brisket plate.  Three thick slices of brisket that were tough and chewy.  The beans and rice side were good, the slaw, meh.  The Texas toast  was not even toasted, more like bread with a smear of grease.  I'm not going back.  That meal was $16+.  Not worth it. Sauceman's is way better."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket I have ever eaten.

Great sauces (Try the Red sauce)!

The atmosphere is rock mixed with motorcycles mixed with sports.

Good beer selection.

The one negative is never enough parking."}
{"text":"I get it.  I got it.  It delivers okay.  For a place that is suppose to have superior barbecue, I got to say... BLAH.  Marketing and hype folks.  The energy or decor comes from the yuppies who want to slum it, but still know they can get their Heinie.
If it was not so staged, this would be the diamond in the rough... but it is staged... it feels fake.  You feel dooped."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some cue and decided to go to Mac's. Haven't been there in awhile.   Finally we had some decent evening weather and decided to eat outside.  The outdoor dining area is right next to the smoking area so you need to watch where they sit you.  

My wife ordered the brisket sandwich- Sandwich, which is open faced, arrived with 2 small slices of brisket on top of limp Texas toast with sauteed onions on the side.  Brisket was tough and chewy.  In the past the sandwich would come loaded with meat and smothered with onions and bbq sauce.  
I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs.  The menu says that they are st;. Louis ribs so they should have been big and meaty. What arrived was baby back ribs.  good smoky flavor but a litlle chewy.  My sides were onion rings and slaw.  The onions ring breading was spicy which wasn't bad but there was way too much breading.  So all that you tasted was the breading.  
I doubt I will be back to Macs anytime soon with so many cue options in town."}
{"text":"This place had really great food. I was very surprised, that's a good sign that people know about it when on Monday night there are no tables to be had at 8:00 PM! I would recommend the ribs, or the beer can chicken. Those were my two favorites. And the mac & cheese is really good too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed on first visit. First basket of hush puppies were cold and limp. Told server, its replacement was no better. Twenty minutes later, when food finally arrived (we were the only customers), the brisket ($16) was almost all disgusting fat, covered in BBQ  sauce. It was not hot in the least.  Macaroni and cheese was room temperature. Server was friendly and apologized for poor food quality. We won't eat there again."}
{"text":"We have been going to Mac's on Sunday night for years.  This will be our last visit due to the slow service and food issues.  We waited 20 minutes for a drink order then another 30 for our food.  When we got our food we were missing a few things and the wings were undercooked.  Drink refills?  Forget about it.  Hush puppies?  If your lucky.  What happened to the Mac's we used to love?"}
{"text":"Flew into town to visit with girlfriends she suggested that I gave it a try and it's just a wonderful place lots of seating and plenty of TVs to watch the game the food is phenomenal definitely will spread the word to friends and family (great eats)!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went by for a late Saturday lunch. We have eaten at other Macs locations and were usually pleased. My wife ordered pulled pork which is always pretty good. I ordered the brisket which was horrible. I have eaten brisket all over Texas, Oklahoma and lots of other places these people do not have a clue what brisket is all about. The pieces served to me were about 1x1.5x4 inches, grey on the inside no moisture and definitely NO smoke ring. Complained to manager who told me that's the they served it for 10 years. So if your looking for Lockhart Texas style brisket run from this place and order online from Kruez Market. The beer was cold and the manager did take the brisket off my tab but did not offer anything else to eat."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best bbq in charlotte. Great food and atmosphere. Ive had just about everything on the menu and nothing disappoints. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Macs hast to be my favorite Restaurant of all time. Macs is a very friendly Restaurant for family's. I have been going to Macs since I was about 10. Macs made me love Mac and Cheese. Mac and Cheese is honestly my favorite thing they have there. Even though it depends on the chef they can taste a little different. I order the 3 side car with Mac and Cheese, Fries, and a side Chopper Salad with Extra Bacon and Blue Cheese Dressing. Macs is friendly to family's because the people are so nice and they have a band outside on the patio on Thursdays."}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ ever! The Carolina BBQ sauce is insane. The atmosphere is awesome. Drink, eat good and listen to live music. Again, the food is second to none. Get the pulled pork or brisket."}
{"text":"I always have great service and food at Mac's. This great location on South Blvd has comfortable indoor and outdoor seating, that can also accommodate large parties. I usually order a BBQ plate or sandwich. Mac's BBQ is a little more greasy than what I'm used to, but alright every once in a while. I like having a variety of sauces to choose from as well. The sweet potato fries and mac-n-cheese don't ever disappoint!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Fun and inviting
Waitresses on the floor: Nice and helpful
Food: Basic BBQ, nothing crazy but never disappointing.

The reason for this review is the sub-par customer service I received while at this location. This is the second occurrence of poor service there, however much worse the second time around.

I sat myself at the bar because being a single person I didn't want to hold up a table during the lunch rush crowd. There was 5 people at the bar when I sat down. I waited for a long time before finally being asked what I would like. After placing my order I quickly received my drink and shortly after received my food (which was brought out from the back by a food runner I assume). 

With my drink gone and my hands covered in sauce, I had nothing to wipe my hands on. Never did the bar tender come by to see if my order was correct or if I needed anything. She instead stood at the end talking to two customers at the bar. I was able to finish my meal and drink...with enough time to use the wax paper from my basket to clean my fingers enough to send a message via Facebook to the Steele Creek location. 

Then all of a sudden Robert the manager appeared and asked me how my service was. I explained the issues I had and he in turn offered to buy me a beer. However, being tight on time and patience I couldn't allow myself to stay any longer. 

What really bothered me was that after everything I got an apology from the manager but nothing taken off my bill and the bar tender never said a word.  With a place this popular I would have hoped for better service and better treatment. 

I wouldn't waste my time going there if you plan on sitting at the bar, get a table and hopefully your experience will be better than mine."}
{"text":"Just ok.  The St. Louis ribs were not fall off the bone tender, as I would expect if they had been coming for 6 hours.  Honestly. My ribs at home are better. Hubby and son had chicken wings, which they described as 'rubbery'."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with a girlfriend and it was above average.
I have been to the other location before and have barely been satisfied with the food and the service. But today was awesome great lunch great service and a great time had by me and my friend.
Plenty of parking there it was an overcrowded though so maybe when I get more crowded parking may be an issue."}
{"text":"The beer was cold,  the wings were great and the service was friendly.  I will definitely go again.."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket sandwich and love that they offer 4 different sauces to try. The hush puppies were a nice starter. The green bean casserole was a nice side choice but way too plain (like I made if from the can).

They had a ton of servers (like 10 on Sunday at 3pm) but it took 10 minutes to get a fork."}
{"text":"Beers galore! Dare I say too many? Nope. Not at all. Especially compared to Taco Mac. Whatever your flavor of beer may be, Mac's will should have it.
Turning the attention to the food... the meats are very good. They are slow cooked. I usually eat the pulled pork platter with two sides. Sometimes I will eat the beef brisket. The sauces for the meats add a nice flavor. The selection of side dishes is nice. And they do run out of some of the sides each day. Such as the mac n cheese. 
Mac's has the element of being a biker bar/restaurant. At the location on Sandy Porter, I've never seen bikers. The location on South Blvd. attracts the bikers. I like the loud atmosphere and look of the restaurant on the inside with lots of wood and bolts.
If you are into rock music, good BBQ, and beer, Mac's is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Had the combo plate.  Three out of four meats were dry/overcooked.  Last time, I had pulled turkey, so dry nearly inedible.  This can't be the best bbq around..."}
{"text":"So, coming from Los Angeles I am used to having plenty of late dining options. Here... not so much. Mac's Speed Shop is open to a pretty late hour, so I have stopped by a few times. Haven't had too many of the options yet, but so far what I have tried has been rather delicious. Burgers and brisket nachos especially! Burger has a real fat piece of meat, just the way I like it and they have some solid variations. Still think the place is just a hair overpriced, but definitely some tasty food and options. Great beer selection too, which is a nice plus when I'm dining in. Atmosphere is another plus."}
{"text":"Really good pulled pork sandwich.  Great place overall."}
{"text":"The Brisket served open face on texas toast is excellent accompanied by a cold California draft beer \"Sculpin\" reminds me of the 5years I spend in San Diego... Wait a minute we are in S. Charlotte :) 

Bike nite is on wednesday."}
{"text":"Macs is in the old Vinnies and they did a great job on the remodel.  I went on a monday for lunch, & was greeted to a $3 pint draft IPA I ordered the \"big Pig\" BBQ sandwich with mac N cheese that reminded me of the way my grandmother makes baked mac (YUMMY)
The food came out quickly for a quick in/out lunch"}
{"text":"I ordered the burger & fries! Burger had a really good charred taste to it. The fries have a a very good seasoned light breading on them. My husband ordered the wings, and loved them! Sat on the patio, and they had a fantastic live band playing. Great atmosphere, and service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"In town on business for two weeks and can't help but eat here everyday. Great BBQ, beer and sevice. Can't beat the price either. Ask for Ashley, she is the best."}
{"text":"Damn, I just love Mac's...  Fortunately I live so close by that I can frequent this place...  The food is house smoked, fresh cut, deliciousness..  The bartenders are just as good (Dora, Rob, Kendra and Allie are all great!!) I've never had a bad visit, always good food, good beer and good company..  What else do you want?!"}
{"text":"It was right after church Sunday and the place was bumping, but we got seated immediately! I hate when you go to a restaurant and the hostess takes 5 minutes to figure out where to seat you (so awkward). First off...the beer list was phenomenal...so many options! Menu had a huge variety also. They bring you hush puppies with honey butter (yum)! My fiancé got the pulled pork and it had a lot of flavor! I got the side car thing (3 sides). Mac and cheese was delicious, green bean casserole was meh, and the salad was very fresh! Server was very friendly! Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes that Matthews -Mint Hill would have another good restaurant to go to.  Not so--bad service,   mediocre food, and very noisy and uncomfortable setting.   DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  Plan to warn my friends as well to not bother going there."}
{"text":"In town in a business trip and hosted a happy hour here for about 12 people. It has a great atmosphere and diverse clientele. Our server was Caroline and, even though the place was very busy, she was very attentive to our party for entire three hours we stayed and had good recommendations on the massive beer list. We only had apps and desserts but they were all really good (fried pickles were amazing). But how they went way above and beyond is that the next day, I realized I had forgotten to grab a copy of the receipt. I called as soon as they opened as my flight back home was in just a few hours. The manager helped me figure out my receipt and sent me a PDF copy right away, he was just so nice! He also remembered to tell me to have a safe flight and let him know if I needed anything else. 

Really impressed with the level of hospitality and customer service. Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Always a good time at Macs! Great place to have a beer, watch a game and enjoy a lively atmosphere.  The burgers and BBQ are solid, as well as the Baja salad.  Large beer selection and usually good specials.  Awesome go-to spot in South End!!"}
{"text":"Beer Can Chicken best chicken in all of NC, SC, FL, TN and TX!! And I keep a bottle of their red sauce & mustard sauce at our house all the time.  Both are very unique but  oh so tasty! We have even got our family in East TN hooked on the sauce.  I have tried the burgers - YUM, onion rings - YUM, BBQ variety platter - YUM (brisket as good as I got in TX, sausage wasn't my cup of tea but not bad), my husband loves the shrimp tacos & collard greens!  Waitresses are very attentive and haven't had a bad experience at Mac's yet."}
{"text":"Love love love their food, but a friend and I just went there with 4 little kids. Manager sat us. It took 12 minutes for a waitress to come over. I had to flag her down to make her come over. She took our order. Half hour later no appetizer and no food. Worst service I have ever experienced. They clearly didn't want to wait on children. They have lost my dine in business and I will tell everyone I come into contact with how rudely we were talked to and treated. Shame on your wait staff for being rude to Mom's with hungry children. I used to love sitting on the patio with a beer on a warm day."}
{"text":"Went to the new location in Matthews yesterday. I was kinda surprised to see every single table in the place was high top w/ stools. There was one normal table in the whole place. If that doesn't scream \"we don't want you to bring kids here\" I don't know what does. Matthews is a family oriented town so I was surprised. They have some picnic tables outside but let's be realistic how beneficial is that?..summer is hot hell and full of mosquitoes and winter for the most part is too cold.  It was too busy so I just placed a to go order. The girl working the desk was sub par at best. A man was waiting to be seated for a few minutes while she had her back towards him wrapping silverware. My order came out and she didn't see it. Sat the gentleman and came back and still didn't see it, so I walk up to the counter and in a real snarky way \"can I help you\" I was like \"yeah is that my order\". She was clueless. Ok now the important part the food...I ordered brisket sandwich w/Mac and cheese. It was sooooo dry and had almost a gasoline smell to it. I couldn't eat it. The Mac and cheese was decent though. I have only been to Macs prior time on South blvd and everything was awesome service and food so I was excited for the Matthews location to open...what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Being from the great state of Texas I REALLY miss good Texas brisket. Not some crock pot crap or brisket cooked in someones oven...real smoked brisket.
The bark is black and full of deep flavor and spices. The pink smoke ring is perfect and the cooking process makes the meat juicy and tender. 
Order the burnt ends! TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"Rumored one of the best BBQ place in town. 

Great space, tall ceiling, kind of like a lodge.  The platter was amazing and they have various beer for everyone's taste. Not a huge fan of their deviled eggs. but the mac and cheese is pretty good. 

Will definitely recommend to anybody who's visiting town."}
{"text":"I love their barbecued chicken wings. Its good with fried pickles and omb beer.
I always enjoyed their outside patio sometimes with live music.
I am regular."}
{"text":"This place was great! Came here on Cinco de Mayo so it was busy but we were seated right away, got excellent service and fast food. The fried catfish was awesome, great Mac and cheese. The dessert was great too. Normal prices, not overcharged. There was live music too, which was nice."}
{"text":"The food is amazing !!! I mean all four times I have went it was great! Only THING I DO NOT LIKE is the customer service . We decided one time too go in & sit. We had got our drinks & there was something black in my boyfriends soda - we should have left there but gave benefit of the doubt . So 10 minutes passed we still have not received our hush puppies . So we then we decided to place an to go . So I ordered the to go food & we had to wait another 15 - 20 minutes . We had no refills . So I then asked for our hush puppies & she (the waitress) tells me well you want food to go so I don't have too get you any. She brought the hush puppies cold ! I had to ask another waitress for another basket of hush puppies . We received our to go food & asked the waitress again for some warm hush puppies she tells us \"I gave them to you for free when I shouldn't have\" very upsetting service for exceptional food"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is the best, Delish brisket, great fried pickles and those signature sauces... We had a few things today, mac and cheese,  brisket wrap, wings and nachos!! You never go wrong for a snack or a meal!! Darts and great juke box!!"}
{"text":"If you like motorcycles, mac n cheese and pulled pork sandwiches this is the place for you... I've stopped in before just for the mac n cheese, good stuff!  Not a bad place to catch a football game, lots of TVs.."}
{"text":"Service:  place was full but we were greeted and seated immediately.  Food arrived fast and server was attentive.
Price:  fair, portions a bit on the small side I'd say but menu selection is terrific 
Quality:  all of the various meats we ordered were dry except for the chicken. Generous saucing is a must (something I am normally loath to do).  At least they have a selection of sauces including mustard.  Major bummer for me, collards.  They are super sweet... nope!
Atmosphere:  we sat in the enclosed patio area (with garage doors down) and it was cold and very loud.  The 4-top hi-top the 3 of us sat at barely accommodated us, 4 people would not have worked.  Place was full of families with little kids.  

Bottom line:  old, dry meat is a deal-breaker"}
{"text":"Great choice of beer on draft as well as in the bottle. Great bar staff and waitresses. We only had a half a dozen of the Hot Buffalo Smoked Wings which are then grilled with great charcoal flavor and just the right amount of sizzle on the lips. Great wings. Cold beer and an awesome Bloody Mary Bar. We will return."}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints. The staff is just OnPoint with your friendly smile and great service. If you ever stop in for lunch they understand you may be crunched for time so you never waiting a long time for your food. This is one restaurant I don't have to ask for anything napkins straws is always provided without mention it and I have been to several even high end restaurants that don't give me the service that I get here. So you know the service is good and the food is great."}
{"text":"Good brisket, excellent pulled pork, great draft list, delicious sides & quick service. Really good find!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in charlotte for a work trip

Got the little bit of everything platter.  Ribs and brisket and sausage were great.  The chicken was a bit off in my opinion and not at the same level as the other three and brought it back down to earth. As others mention great beer list. if you cant find a beer you like in their selection you must hate beer."}
{"text":"Looking for bar b q well this is the best ! Always count on great food and service and atmosphere when we come here"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best BBQ in Charlotte! Baked beans are so good and full of flavor. The brisket and pulled pork are so fork tender. This place gets very crowded but it's for a good reason!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Mac's and it was ok. I had the wings and they were ok. Nothing special and taste equivalent to Buffalo Wild Wings. The mac and cheese is bland. Will probably be back for a drink or watch a game, but the food is not that appetizing."}
{"text":"First off, if you ride - this is best place in Charlotte to hang out period.  Plenty of bike parking and events.  Now to the food.  Best wings in town.   They slow smoke them, then put your favorite sauce on and grill em.   Melt in your mouth good.  They stay a little pink due to smoking, but trust me, cooked through and through without drying out.   The best item here is, unfortunately, only available on Wednesday at lunch.   The smoked then grilled meatloaf is the best.  No soggy bread filled stuff here.  It's a solid 10oz of lean, smoked ground steak.  Comes with mash potatoes and gravy - or you can sub for another side (collards are my personal favorite). Add the 30+ beers on tap and great selection in the cooler and you're set.   Last but def not least.  The nicest servers, bartenders and managers.  Always looking to make your visit great and will fix anything anytime if not to your liking.  Dang - i just read this back. Sounds like I work here... but I don't.. just a regular who finally took the time to give Macs the props it deserves."}
{"text":"Everything tasted great and come in big portions. We had the 66 burger, fried catfish, sausage sampler, and hush puppies, everything was tasty and the service was great. They have specials every night and tonight was 1/2 off wine, which my wife enjoyed. Good selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Wonderful staff!  And the food.... Yummy!!!!! I started with dessert and that was just a teaser to the delicious food we had!  Thanks to a friend who sent us to you, hope we can some back soon.  Good luck to your future endeavors!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mac n cheese, really good Cuban but it could be better if it was pressed. I'll definitely be back for more and to try more if their BBQ menu. Love the waitress I had she was super excited and very friendly blonde woman. Great salesperson as well her name was Melissa."}
{"text":"Honestly I just go there for the sweet tea/lemonade mix, muffins and to die for smoked wings."}
{"text":"Good food!  The BBQ turkey was great.  I haven't found anything on the menu that I don't like."}
{"text":"I've been to this Mac's location a couple of times.  It is nice to have a BBQ place in this area since it is culinarily lacking.  The food is solid and the beer list is great!  The pork nachos are delicious as well as the hushpuppies.  On this occasion I ended up getting a beef brisket sandwich.  Very good!  However, it is not a good place for groups, pretty loud, and the service is not much above average.  The food / beer / location are big pluses for me and counteract the ambiance of Mac's that I find slightly annoying."}
{"text":"We have dined here before and always enjoyed the Bbq. We got the smoked wings today and they were the best wings we ever had. We'll always them from now on."}
{"text":"Mac's use to be good.  I use to frequent Mac's often, but since late last year it has gone down hill.  Service is OK.  Prices of food have gone up and quality has gone down.  Will not be giving them any more chances.  They have their regulars who will keep the business going.  But if they don't improve on the quality they will eventually lose out.  Would no longer recommend.  Don't mind paying more, but you better keep your quality the same or better."}
{"text":"They have extremely friendly service and the owner was very attentive. The food was good and you get large portions for what you would pay at a fast food place. I had a small barbecue plate that was better than most place that I have been. The hush puppies were excellent and the sauces were even better. Definitely will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I've been quite a few times and this was the only time it's ever not been good. It was a beautiful evening and Mac's has a great feel how it opens up in the front with outdoor seating. My friend and I were so excited to eat and drink after five years and our final day of work... And for some reason our server (receipt says Jennifer) had an attitude from the moment she greeted us. We were nothing but chill and friendly and not high-demanding at all. (An order of food each and a beer each. We would've stayed for more but we were just so uncomfortable we left.) I'm talking would set things down and not even speak to us. The BBQ chicken nachos were dry - dried shredded cheese - had to ask for warm queso to pour on them and could've even used more but was afraid to ask. Terrible service, sad to say."}
{"text":"This place is great every time you go. Staff is always friendly, doing their best to make you happy. Prices are reasonable and the craft beer selection is on point! I've been here numerous times since they opened and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is one great BBQ spot, great service, Devyn is a great server, makes great suggestions and makes it easy to have a great time with great food in a group. Brisket is so amazing and the burnt ends are a must !!!!NoDa on tap and Wicked Weed say no more! This is a must stop for moderately priced but high quality BBQ without the grease... the apps were great... a must return"}
{"text":"Mac's is always fantastic. Tasty food. Great flavors. Decent prices. BBQ good. Tacos excellent. Good sauces. Banana Pudding is top notch. It looks intimidating (bikers and beer) but the food is the BEST \"bar food\" you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot that I frequent for both lunch and dinner. Pretty laid back atomosphere with good smoky BBQ. I always go for the pulled pork platter but the chicken is also a favorite of mine. I have never had a bad experience here and will continue to reccommend to friends. Side note, I took my dad here when he was in town a couple months back and he raves about it everytime I see him."}
{"text":"Somehow I have lived in Charlotte for almost 6 months and just realized that Mac's is less than 10 minutes from my house.  

We visited Mac's on a Thursday evening and were intimidated by all the cars in the parking lot when we pulled in. We almost changed our minds.  I was expecting a wait, but we were seated right away and there were other empty tables.  I think the crowd on the patio accounted for a lot of the cars.

Overall, our experience was great.  Good service and the food came super quick (as it should in bbq place).  We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer.  I somehow neglected to read the part about spicy in the menu.  They aren't kidding!  They have a kick.  Don't really care for spicy food, but they were good - and I was warned after all.  Homemade ranch was tasty.

Hubs ordered the half smoked chicken and it was perfection.  So awesome.  Beans and fries were tasty sides.  I ordered a veggie plate with green bean casserole, super awesome mac n cheese and onion rings.  I found the onion rings too spicy - wondering if I missed that warning too - but hubs liked them.  Everything was just super tasty and the mac n cheese is totally craveable!

I had plenty of plate envy watching the food being delivered around me.  We will be back.

If I have to have a gripe, it would be that our waitress sat down on the booth beside me to take our order and I saw her doing this with other patrons as well.  Maybe I'm weird, but I hate it when waitpersons do this.  Maybe if I've been eating here for years - maybe - maybe - but not with someone you don't know."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Service, not so great. Waitress was not attentive, perhaps because she was getting ready to go on vacation??"}
{"text":"We tried the \"little bit of stuff\" combo. The pork and brisket were on point! Damn good stuff. The ribs fell straight off the bone and the chicken was moist and flavorful. Didn't try the beef sausage. The greens were good, not the best I've ever had but good. The mac and cheese side was also good, not overloaded with cheese like some places but with a good flavor. Great drink list with a lot of Michigan beers; being from MI that was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I had the 4 meat combo that came with Texas toast and 2 sides.I split it with my boyfriend and it was the perfect amount of food. Phenomenal. The atmosphere is fun and they have every beer your heart could desire. Lots of TVs to watch games. Join their beer club! You get fun merchandise as you build up points."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall! I ordered the pulled pork with cheesy grits and cole slaw... the cheesy grits were to die for! The slaw had was really runny, I probably won't order it again. I love the selection of BBQ sauces the have, although it was kind of difficult to choose which one! I thought the bread that came with my meal would be a good touch, but it was so-so.. tasted kind of stale. I love their selection of beer! It was perfect after a long hike on a hot and sunny day. We chose to sit outside and it was really crowded. We didn't see to much of our server, but the food came out the same time I got my beer..too fast if you ask me! I like to take my time and enjoy my company when dining out, but I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Charlotte and to a BBQ joint whose team has competed and won on the BBQ trail. Mac's Speed Shop offers a wide range of food including wings, salads, mexicue, and, of course, BBQ.

Dora here. Anyone else curious as to how they came up with that name? Just wondering. lol. We were among the few to brave high 90 degree temps to enjoy their spacious outdoor patio, which really was quite nice. Most everyone opted for a/c and chose to eat inside.:) Even so, service was fast and efficient, and the server helpful with suggestions.

The Onion Rings Basket appetizer came with a spicy horseradish dipping sauce. These rings were great-dredged in what appeared to be corn meal?- crunchy on the outside and tender enough to bite through. The dipping sauce complimented nicely, although a bit spicy. Dora here. A bit spicy? That cayenne and horseradish kicked big time, but soooo good! Yowza! Make sure you ask for extra napkins to wipe your forehead. Fair warning.

For our meal, we chose to share the Little Bit of Stuff, a combo platter which included our choice of St. Louis ribs, Texas beef sausage, beef brisket, and smoked turkey with sides of mac n cheese and cream corn.

The ribs were great, competition grade, smoky, and cooked perfectly, moist and not fatty. The sausage was equally good, not spicy at all, but with a hardy beef flavor.

Dora here. Wow, I'm glad we ordered the little platter. Even sharing, we still brought home leftovers. For some reason, I expected the turkey to be sliced, so I was surprised when it came out pulled. A tad dry for my liking, probably because I can't help but compare it to my favorite holiday meal, fried turkey. Still, it was tender and will make awesome sandwiches later. The brisket was chewy with just a hint of sweet at the end. Yum! This was some of my favorite BBQ besides hubby's. They score big points for great sides, too. The mac n cheese was firm, not moist like some cheesy pastas, just the way I like it, and those kernels of corn snapped with freshness. Mac's Speed Shop definitely gets added to our \"must go back\" list. Maybe then we'll find out how they got their name. lol.

{"text":"First time here and it satisfied the hunger beast  in me! I had the ribs & the meat was tender & fell right off the bone. So yummy & great flavor! Onion rings were  a bit different. They were good but I was expecting crunchy, these had no crunch & the batter taste like it should go on chicken tenders rather than an onion. The Blue Burger over all is a good burger but if you are expecting it to be full of blue cheese flavor this is not the burger to get. Another downside to the burger is they forgot the bacon. Mac n cheese, green bean casserole, & coleslaw were all delicious! The decor is really cool & the staff is nice."}
{"text":"The smoked wings were tasty, although not nearly as yummy as many of the smoked wings I've had in N.C. so far. I'd give them a 2.5 out of 5 because they were dry which left the meat a bit crumbly and chewy.

The complimentary hush puppies were super yum. Overall is wasn't bad for what it was. I'll return to try the beef rib."}
{"text":"This place is a regular hang out. The food is good - the beer is plentiful and the service is usually fast and friendly. It's not too pricey so it makes for a great weekly spot. In the summer there are always live bands on Friday nights.

If your hungry get the ribs although everything is pretty tasty.

Might not be worth a special trip but it does have a special place in my stoma.. I mean.. heart."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have tried most of the choices on the menu. The food is amazing! The wait staff is knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. The beer list is impressive. The combo platter was out of this world! Highly recommend Mac's Speed Shop for out of towners as well as locals."}
{"text":"Been to this place quite a few times.  Always has been great.  We usually sit at the bar, as custom. This time we were served by Dora. First time on a Monday and we were reminded it was $3 pints.  What?! 

Over a time of enjoyable convo with my husband, we ordered several pints.  We again ordered some food - Big Pig with mac n cheese.  Never disappointed.  Great food here. 

This place is great.  Awesome specials, don't forget $3 pints on Mondays and they have a wide variety of craft beer.  So WIN WIN! I believe, based on appearances, Wednesday is their pint takeover. Come by, buy a pint featured and most likely get a pint glass.  We are 3 for 3! White Street, Devils Backbone and Starr Hill. 

Overall, wonderful atmosphere, great service, pretty good food and awesome selection of craft brews.  They have daily specials, so make sure to check them out online.  

Cheers"}
{"text":"Concierge recommended Mac's for good BBQ but warned of biker atmosphere.  Food was good - ribs very tender but Brunswick stew too spicy and had more vegetables than I'm used to and was soupy.  Awesome Mac n Cheese.  Great selection of beers.  Lots of people smoking but smoke didn't permeate everything.  Good band on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Super reasonably priced! Really loved the Mac n cheese & fries. Their catfish was heavenly. (Did not like the creamed corn at all!). Large outdoor seating, great beer list, good service, and yummy yummy food."}
{"text":"Highly impressed with Mac's Speed Shop. Tons of TVs if you're looking to catch a game. The outside seating is nice and allows a great view of South Blvd. The hush puppies are GOAT level, the wings are beyond delicious and they have a great selection of beer too. My server was attentive and made great suggestions for my wife and I. Definitely a must if you're looking for somewhere to eat on South!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner on a Saturday night. The place was packed but we were able to grab a seat and get served quickly. They give you a complimentary basket of hush puppies while you wait for your food which is a nice touch. The pulled pork was good and they had a variety of bbq sauces to try. The place is definitely loud with a varied crowd of people and seemed to clear out as the night went on. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here probably 20 times over the last 5 years.  Was always great.  Went last night and food quality has gone really down hill.  Smoked wings were soggy, green beans seemed to be from a frozen bag and all the BBQ & ribs used to be served dry but now is wet. Even the mac and cheese was different.  Not sure if it's new ownership or new chef but everything was different.  Hope they can step it up because it's a fun place to go but I don't see myself returning again with the food quality."}
{"text":"Been to the one on south Blvd twice and both times it wasn't very good.  The second time they botched 3 of 5 orders and who I believe to have been the shift manager looked at us some type of way as if we were lying to him.  I really wanted this place to be great. Got my hopes up and let down both times."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Everyone is very friendly. I've tried Jim and Nicks and Midwood Smokehouse several times. Macs is simply better. Food is great, beer selections are always changing which I love. The whole family loves it. It's a new regular place for us."}
{"text":"Awesome, fun atmosphere with delicious food. Savory bbq, skins, hush puppies with bacon butter!  Top management & waitress Allie offered top notch customer service.  Customers  ranged from wisest of age to children, bikers to college dudes, sports fans to fans of the live band."}
{"text":"Average, average, average. Did I mention average?  Neither location is very impressive but at least south Blvd you can gawk at, well... South Blvd.  Here I found myself staring at the backside of the QT.  Strange place for a restaurant.  Sat outside cause of the beautiful NC day and waited and waited for a wait person.  Finally got some diet cokes ordered when another wait person came by to ask for a drink order.   the deck must be rotation or something.  Caused a lot of confusion with who's table we may be.  I had the fish tacos, borderline cold and very average (there's a theme going here).  I had some chewy ribs at the other location which makes me think they are going for a\" large chain with average food\" thing.  Fun for beers on the deck but not really my cup of tea food wise."}
{"text":"I only stopped here from a recommendation from a friend who said when I drive through, I must stop here even if its for pick up. WOW! I ordered the burnt ends, full rack of ribs, mac and cheese and a pulled pork sandwich for my wife. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered. The place was packed, but I still got my order very quickly when I showed up. I even took a peek at the draft list, and if I wasn't already running behind to pick my wife up, I would have had a pint or two because the selection was awesome! About the food.... The burnt ends were flavorful and tender. I had to wrestle my wife away from my ribs because they were so juicy and delicious. The next time we are driving through Charlotte, I am going to make sure this is a stop we make for a sit down experience because this place was great!"}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Macs. We stumbled across it but we will definitely be back. I had a spark plug burger and my wife had the beer can chicken. Both were fantastic. Groovy place, cool atmosphere, great staff!"}
{"text":"BBQ is ok. Onion rings aren't very good. Recommend the fries or fried pickles for a side. Pulled pork is the best of the meats I have tried. Good for a quick lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Ordered catering from the other location and they told us the order was here. When we showed up here they told us that someone had already picked up the order. After realizing the other location lost our order this location made sure to do everything they could to fulfill the order. Within 10 minutes they had 10lbs of brisket and pulled pork ready to go, along with other sides. Couldn't be happier with the outcome, food was great and service was awesome. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice atmosphere that and great food Mac's is a solid choice. The atmosphere is loud and nothing about this place is fancy. It claims to be a place for bikes, babes, and beer, and in addition to its great food has an extensive beer selection. This place gets all five stars because it has a nice atmosphere,  service, and great food (especially the wings -- and try the hog wings too!)

One follow-up note: the last two times the wings have not been consistent. Sometimes they are good, but unfortunately leave room for improvement. Still like the place. Adjusted review to four stars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and to make it better, the service was excellent. Hannah was very nice without being overly bearing. Was here on business and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time trying the BBQ and it was good. The sausage was burnt but other than that the rest was very good."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. On my last visit, I stopped on my way home on from work around 6:00pm to get a pound of brisket to go. Got home only to discover the brisket appears that it was cooked the day before and the slices were just heated back up on a grill then dredged in sauce to give some moisture. Didn't work, it was dry, grey, and stiff. I didn't appreciate paying $20+ for day old food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service has always been great. Food is good, but it is BBQ. I love the outdoor space and the beer selection. I'm most disappointed in the enforcement of the NO SMOKING on the patio. I understand you have an addiction and can't go 5 minutes without smoking but if people are eating around you, take your carcinogenic, tobacco habit self, out in the grass or the parking lot and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Great wings, great chicken, great quesadillas.  Burger wasn't any good.  Service is great if you can find a seat or a parking spot.  I try to go to this place for lunch or early dinner because at night it's just a zoo.  It's a shame when a place is good, they get \"too\" busy to be enjoyed anymore."}
{"text":"Love coming here every Sunday. My son is a very picky eater and will only eat the free hush puppies from here (no where else) we insist on paying every time and they joyfully decline. Great, clean, family atmosphere with a nice biker twist. Brisket is the best in town as well!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection with specials on Mondays. It's a bbq joint that also does all other bar food pretty well. I love their mustard sauce. It's got some kick! High top seating rules it out for parties with kids."}
{"text":"Do they have anything that doesn't taste like BBQ sauce? Like anything? Perhaps the ice cubes? I am not a fan of ketchup based BBQ but, my friends wanted to come here. Which is cool and all I've had tasty food here before. The bartender constantly kept asking my friends who weren't drinking if they were ready for a drink. The wings were horrible. I asked if they could be extra crispy or cooked a little longer and was told yes. Mushy wings covered in a mixture of disgusting BBQ sauce and mild sauce arrived. 

Update: Went from two stars to one as I have been sick all night and all day after eating"}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting this location, and both times our service has been great. Their wings are some of the best I've ever had, and their salads are excellent. 
First visit: my husband and I shared the Hot Classic Buffalo wings, which are medium warm to hot. He had the Switchback salad, and I had the Chopper salad. Both salads were delicious. 
Second visit: we shared the Smokin' Burnout wings - which are def hotter than the Hot Classic Buffalo. I ordered extra burnt - which were fantastic. They're hot, no doubt, but not so hot that they choke you. They're my new fave flavor wings from Mac's.  Their ranch and blue cheese dressings are great; not sure if they're homemade  - but still very good, nonetheless.  I had Switchback salad and husband had Thunderbird salad with blackened chicken. Again - both were excellent. 
Since today's Sunday (night) they have a live band playing - which is great. However, we were seated at a table inside and the music playing inside was def clashing with the live band's music from outside.  Also, being seated inside near the hallway to bathrooms, the area was pretty dark - more so than I care for. I like a good bit of lighting, but that's just me. 
We will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had the wings and loved the atmosphere today for lunch.  Nice place to hang out.  Wish I could have had a beer!  But back to work I go!!  Maybe next time.  Very good first visit. Thank you."}
{"text":"Literally any time that I am in Charlotte this is a must! I was in town for a wedding, and first thing that I did Friday after flying in, was make my way to Mac's. Love their outdoor area, array of sauces, and some of the best cooked meats you could ask for. I got the pulled pork, and my friend got the ribs. Also they have a great beer selection to add onto your order. (Also when you order, be sure to get the mac and cheese, you won't be sorry.)"}
{"text":"As strange as it sounds, this by far is one of my favorite Mac's restaurants.  I say strange because you would think they would all give you the same outcome. I visited one other location in Charlotte and I was not impressed at all (food and service were poor). I was almost upset at myself that I didn't just stick to what I know. 

Food- I'm not a pork eater, but I can definitely vouch for the chicken. The smoked wings are some of the best I've had anywhere. They are the right kind of meaty and depending on what sauce, they are the right kind of saucy. The quarter/half smoked chicken is great also (This can be tossed in sauce also) I don't usually go for string beans casserole on a normal day, but I'd say go for it. In addition,  I was extremely surprised at the cheddar grits,  also a win. On the pork side, although I don't eat it; Everyone I brought here says that it's delicious. Not to mention the important part, food always comes out in a reasonable time and hot. 

Service- Honestly, the service can be a little dry. I'm not sure if that depends on who your server is or if it's just an all around personality thing. They still provide decent service. I will say a major plus is, management at this location comes around to each table during your meal to make sure all is well.  

Overall experience - I enjoy everything about this macs location. The beverages are great and priced ok,  and I believe they have specials on food and drinks on diff days. Try the complimentary hushpuppies! Without a doubt It's def worth going!"}
{"text":"This week was my second time having Mac's.  We had lunch this week for a birthday in the office.  We ordered from the Steele Creek location, but the only other time I went was to the Lake Norman location.  I can't speak for service this time as someone else ordered and picked up our food.

I ordered pork bbq, it was pretty good as was the sauce that it came with. The sides were definitely blah.  Potato Salad - some of the worst I have had, just does not have a flavor kick to it at all.  Side Salad - shredded lettuce with a bunch of bacon bits and tomatoes - blah.  Had a bite of someone else's macaroni and cheese, very bland, did not care for it.

With other much better bbq options out there, I don't see myself returning on my own dime."}
{"text":"Really confused by the good reviews here. The food at this place is not good and being new to this area, even I would hesitate to call it authentic \"NC BBQ\".

I've been here twice now and it was disappointing both times. I had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich the first time and it was dry and bland. I had the spinach salad with blackened chicken today and the chicken was too salty and the flavors just didn't go well together.

It seems like people go to this place more for the ambiance and probably cause it's been a neighborhood favorite all these years. Who knows. 

I've had BBQ in Raleigh and so I have a sense of what BBQ is supposed to taste like. With the exception of Soul and the Cellar, the food scene in Charlotte is just sadly mediocre."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there around 8PM on October 17, 2014. One of the servers dropped an entire container of salsa on my husband's lap, getting all over his shorts and shirt. He was a good sport about it, while the employees cleaned it up... however, you'd think a manager would come by with an additional apology, etc. All we got at the conclusion of our meal was a check and a \"see you next time.\" After paying our check, my husband asked to speak to the manager; however, after two attempts, the hostess informed us that the manager was \"too busy\" to speak with us. Glad to hear that the management at the Steele Creek location is too busy for its customers... too busy to right a wrong."}
{"text":"Great brisket!!  Good selection of BBQ meats. Lots of side dishes and reasonable prices. Sometimes loud. Nice inside, not asuch as a dive as I would like it. You can take the kids here."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great staff. I actually prefer this Mac's over the S. Blvd one as this one is more of a local neighborhood place. The guy below blasted this Mac's thinking it was the S. Blvd location so disregard that chuckies review. 

Pro's: Great bbq, great non bbq foods and sides. Good beer selection and they always have a daily drink special. You get you food fast if you want it, some plates might need more time but what I order is usually ready asap. They just changed the menu and the new burgers are awesome. The staff works hard and remembers most of the patrons, they are tight knit here. Live bands on Saturdays outside with no cover charge. Great location in South Charlotte. The food is very consistant what you get one time is much like the next time. 

Con's: Prices went up and have gone up steadily over the years, could be economic reasons not sure. The parking lot can get full very quickly but that is a sign of popularity so I deal with it."}
{"text":"I went there on a friday night. They had good food and live music with reasonable prices. Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but certainly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Mac's consistently has great food and the service is always friendly! Highly recommend their roadhouse salad with barbecue chicken. You can tell they make their dressing in house."}
{"text":"I can't even imagine how or why I would ever return to this place again.  They clearly need to rethink their staffing.  Especially the blondish Amazon at the hostess stand out front.  She managed to completely ruin a once in a lifetime moment!

I returned to Charlotte to celebrate a landmark birthday with a very close friend.  Oddly enough, when asked where she would like to have dinner, she chose this place after only having been there twice before.

When we arrived, we were asked if we preferred to be seated inside or out.  I turned to my guest and said loud enough for the Amazon to hear, \"It's your birthday, (notice the subtle hint), you decide\"  The place was busy, but there were table dotted throughout the inside dining area.  The Amazon knows this is a birthday dinner.  So where does she seat us?  Under the television, in the back, quite close to the noisy kitchen.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!

Because my guest is so gracious, she says nothing.  It only takes a minute or two of not hearing anything the other is saying to know this will not work.  My guest walks back over to the Amazon to ask if we might change to outdoor seating.  It would have to have been quieter than where we were.  We were moved outside with minimal fuss.  Open tables were dotted all around the outdoor seating as well.

Remember, the reason we asked for the change of seating was noise.  Also remember that the Amazon should know this was a birthday dinner.

When the waitress comes over just a few minutes later to take a drink order, we are shouting at each other while barely hearing each other.  Why, you ask?  BECAUSE THE AMAZON SAT US RIGHT NEXT TO THE OUTDOOR STAGE, AND WE HAD NO IDEA A BAND WAS ABOUT TO START.  C'mon!!

By the way, the band was a bunch of old dudes that opened playing a Led Zeppelin tune.  As God is my witness, I have heard high school aged garage bands do it better.  WTF?!

We did the only thing left for us to do - Get the heck out of Dodge!

Some things only happen once in a lifetime.  For what this place did to that once in a lifetime, I can only wish them a slow and painful death...."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time and it was delicious. All 4 of us liked what we got and the beer selection was amazing. Our server let us sample a beer before ordering. The fried pickles, pork BBQ, chicken BBQ, and burgers were all great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The menu is great!  I have not had anything I didn't like.  I especially love the Thunderbird salad, it's my fav!  I usually get great service but this last time I wasn't pleased.  The waitress was kind of bland and dry.  She greeted us and took drink order but she forgot to ask my husband what he wanted to drink.  Then she brings hush puppies, which are free but I  didn't know,  and she Rudely responded with \"They are free\" after I told her we didn't order this.  Lastly, we were done and ready to go and she came to ask us if we wanted anything else, we said no, usually that means bring the check but she went on to the back took forever and came back to start cleaning tables.  I had to tell her Please process this payment asap because I had to go.  I was on a lunch break so needless to say I was late getting back to work.  I will eat there again because I love the food but I will request a different waitress."}
{"text":"I was not aware that this location even existed until a former coworker invited me to lunch. It's very easy to find, basically right across the street from the Matthews post office on John Street.

The exterior of the building is very interesting and inviting. Upon entry I was immediately greeted and seated. I am not a huge fan of barbecue but was interested in their brisket salad which was what I ultimately ordered. I have to say it was fantastic. The brisket comes in slices rather than shredded, which is not my favorite way, but it was well cooked and seasoned so I didn't mind. The salad components were fresh and plentiful. I really enjoy their Carolina Barbecue Sauce combined with blue cheese dressing made in house. My companion had pulled pork sandwich with green bean casserole and mac and cheese. Both were quite tasty as well as the sandwich.

Service was friendly almost to the point of being annoying because she kept checking back to us at the table while we were trying to catch up on conversation. However all of our needs were met efficiently so I have no complaints.

I will definitely be returning here again!"}
{"text":"hey mark, give it another chance, i've been eating there for years and food has always been SUPERB 99% of the time...every place has an off day..only complaint i have is their waitstaff is not great, you have to throw something at them a lot of the time to get service..other than that its great IMHO"}
{"text":"Awsome food. I had the pull pork bbq sandwich which was delicious. But the Mac and cheese was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Fun place with good food and friendly service, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After eating at 2 different locations, and trying a bunch of different things on the menu, I have to finally say that I am not a huge fan of Mac's.  I think the brisket here is usually a little tough and chewy, and they don't really pile it on, so I always feel like I'm left wanting.  The other item I've had a few times that I do like is the beer can chicken, which I think is pretty moist typically and has a good flavor.  As for the sides, they're all pretty standard fare, the mac'n cheese isn't crazy good, and the collards are good too.  I'll still use this as a regular lunch spot, but I just don't think I can give it more than 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great. Talk about flavor! The food, the people, the atmosphere. Loved it.

Let's start with the food. I live in California, so it might be that my BBQ standards aren't as high as the Carolina locals, but this place blew me away. Everything was fresh, hot, and incredibly flavorful and delicious. I've been craving the food ever since my visit. 

We had:

* Mac's Chili - among the best I've had
* Smoked Pork Wings - never had these before; what a treat!
* A Whole Lot of Stuff (pulled pork, beer can chicken, smoked turkey, ribs) - everything was so tasty and delicious
* Sides (mac 'n cheese, baked beans, fries, green bean casserole) - again, everything was flavorful and delicious

The red sauce was so amazing, I ordered some online. I'm anxiously awaiting delivery.

The service was also perfect. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, competent, knowledgable, and she handled a few minor errors with style and grace.

I can't wait for a return trip to NC so I can return to Mac's!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have driven by a million times at least. They have a lot of awesome sounding live music outside. Speaking of which, their outside patio area very spacious, and really cool looking for it to be so simplified. 

The inside atmosphere, to me, is more sports bar, rather than the \"biker bar\" type of places they kind of pretend to be. They do have a motorcycle body hanging from the ceiling and the flyers and decorations around the room are biker oriented, but really, it's more sporty.

They have a lot of tvs and one of the factors that make them unique, or so I'm told, is that they play every NFL game. 

Another positive is the beer variety. They have a HUGE selection to choose from and if you love trying new things like I do, you are bound to find some new beers to try on this list. Decision overload!

The food is tasty. I've had their salads, their burgers (including the vespa veggie burger), a fish sandwich, and their chili, as well as fries. I've found all of it to be pleasing. The prices are right on. 

Negatives.

The type of people they draw in aren't really my type of people. Lots of aggressive looking people in khakis, untucked button down shirts with the top button unbuttoned, and sandals, with well groomed hair cuts, resting asshole face with a gleam of smugness and mostly making aggressive, loud outbursts that makes their friends around them happy.... especially the empty looking women who probably at one point in their lives pretended they were one of the women from Sex in the City and deep down think that their self-worth depends on how well they can S.A.D. Basically, the types of cool guy frat boys who look really successful but also narcissistic, and the shallow, sheepish women type that everyone else in the world love (just not as much as they love themselves). I don't though. Maybe I'm the asshole. A judgmental asshole. But most of us are so F.U. 

This of course is not everyone there, but lots. Every time I've come here, it's been lots. Regardless, not my atmosphere. 

I've been bumped into a lot here as the inside is super crowded. Really REALLY crowded. The tables and chairs are packed in way too tightly. Even over the loud murmur of crowd noise you can somehow hear your neighbors conversations better than the person or people at your own table. I am not exaggerating this. The parking lot is worse. They should move to a larger location. 

I swear that the last time I came here, that my waitress was high as hell for the second half of our little unfortunate adventure with her. For one she sucked. She was slow, and very aloof. We didn't see her very long periods at a time. I even heard people at a nearby table (like 1 foot away) mention that she sucks too and so it wasn't just me. After her disappearance, I was relieved to see her because, well, we were wondering if she was okay at this point. She was. She was more than okay, as she was clearly blazed, which explains her prolonged absence. We got our check and she brought back our receipts, but no my debit card. Her potheadedness must have rubbed off on me because I didn't realize that she didn't bring my card back until later that night. 

Nothing wrong with that. I used to smoke the devil's lettuce too, back in the day, but I also believe that weed amplifies the negative aspects of one's personality and if she already was a crappy waitress then being high just made her ten times worse and she shouldn't be trusted with people's debit cards. :)

Overall, the atmosphere just isn't for me. I tried coming here a few times thinking it would be a nice go-to place for a beer and whatever, but I will pass this place up more often than decide to eat here. I give it an A-Ok, but am not a fan (3 of 5 stars)."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best bbq ive had.  Ive never had the \"carolina\" version of bbq but this did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is loud and probably not good for kids, but the food makes up for it all.  Not to mention that they had my food out within 5 mins of me ordering piping hot!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"My first trip to Mac's was wonderful!  The beef brisket was tender and freaking amazing.... It practically melted in my mouth.  The service was fast & friendly. 

Our second visit was not so great.  The service was horrible and the food mediocre.  It's a convenient location for us and since our first visit was exceptional, I figured it was just a bad day.  Those happen occasionally.  

Subsequent visits have me this:  Nothing at this location is consistent. One time you might get exceptionally prepared food, but crappy service. And the next time you might get average food and excellent service. You just never know. Maybe that's part of their charm?"}
{"text":"While it is not my normal atmosphere, the food made this an enjoyable lunch.  A good friend gave this place a great recommendation so we tried it out for a Friday lunch.  A very friendly \"biker\" atmosphere and sufficient parking.  Service was attentive and friendly.  There was no wait for seating at 1:00.

The menu has many very good sounding items and it was hard to choose.  I really wanted to try the BBQ but it sounded like more food than I wanted.  Two tacos sounded like a better fit.  We started with a basket of onion rings.  They arrived quickly and were very tasty.  If we knew they had free hush puppies we probably would not have gotten the rings.  Both were a lot for just two people.

My wife enjoyed her switchback salad with chicken.  My brisket taco was great and the buffalo chicken taco was ok.  If the buffalo chicken had more buffalo sauce and heat it would have been great.  The brisket had great flavor and was paired well with the slaw and salsa.  I would get the brisket tacos again.

Overall, it was an enjoyable lunch.  Good food.  The raised stools would be a challenge for our kids and the atmosphere was a bit loud as well.  It is probably a fun weekend venue with friends.  Not our ideal family restaurant.  It is worth a visit though."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in the area.  A ton of food, excellent beer selection.  Just an overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow what bad service.  After apps were eaten, approx 10-15 mins passes. Before we asked were our main food was.. All sudden it came out from different waitress and our waitress finally comes over and admits she was outside talking to friends while out food got cold.  We come here every other Friday from pool and now this is 3rd instance of piss poor management.  When asked to see Manager they pointed me to a bartender because Manager left already... 10pm...  With hours left on a Friday night... We paid for what we ate and he gave us the 2 cold sides and a soggy taco  with cold wings for free in take home boxes.. PS we left the taco. It was cold and soggy... Owner of original macs.. Please fix this.. Good food with bad management is gonna cost you your business.  This is second time now the waitress was too busy bs with her friends while tables went unattended."}
{"text":"Being a northern transplanted to Charlotte area. I have been hitting every BBQ place I can convince my wife to go to. Mac's is probably one our favorites at this point. We never have to wait really and it's been relatively crowded sometimes. The ribs and pulled pork hits the nail on the head. Fried pickles and the onion rings were awesome. My favorite is the smoked sausage I love it. Beer is always cold selection is top notch they have featured craft beers of the month but they also have tall boys of coors light. The service is fast like sometime a little to fast but it's alright by me I hate waiting for my food. You have 4 options for sauces mustard based, vinegar based, tomato based, and carolina style. The hush puppies are excellent and they come out before your meal so you can yes them to try sauces. They have challenge to eat a five pound sandwich which I'm working up the courage To try one day."}
{"text":"Had the carbonara pasta and liked it quite a bit. The service was very very slow which is why I'm rating them at a 4."}
{"text":"I was expecting much more from this place. Hush puppies even they are \"free\" were terrible, and cold. Waitress refilled my soda from another(? Cup. Really? Oh, and just the half. Couldn't believe it.  I felt uncomfortable. My husband ordered \"bbq Sammy\", as soon as it get cold, it was as hard as a stone, I only ordered chips with guacamole and salsa for $6. Meh... Not the best experience."}
{"text":"four meats tons of food and cold beer 

what are you talking about  great place
taken last two customers here to close the deal
even make sure they get sauce on the paperwork"}
{"text":"Let's see...  Service was slow, order was wrong, brisket was rubbery, and it was almost impossible to hear others at the table.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Don't eat the south blvd macs there dirty cooks and rude staff and management that they have I wouldn't recommend people I say more it's way much better BBQ out there in charlotte this place sucks"}
{"text":"I'm not a HUGE fan of BBQ but when I'm in the mood, this has become the spot I run to. Their ribs and baked beans are amazing!!! My friend is crazy over their fries and pulled pork. I haven't had much if anything else off their menu but I'm sure it's awesome. I'd definitely give this place a try. I've had a couple ditsy waitresses but overall they're pretty nice and laid back. lol"}
{"text":"Food was good but it took forever for me to get service. People that arrived after me already had drinks and appetizer orders before I had my water. Probably wont go back."}
{"text":"We were having lunch and for starters the service is not the friendliest or most attentive . The meat quality is good overall the food is 3 stars the service is 2 stars and the reason for one star is the fact that there were large roaches in the bathroom see photo I mentioned it to the staff and no one did anything ."}
{"text":"Man, I don't know what happened to this place lately. Seems the quality of food has gone down some in the past few months. The fried pickles just don't taste as good as they use to (they changed up the seasoning/batter) and the hush puppies use to be a lot better when they were not served as a complimentary appetizer. Don't get me wrong, I like free hush puppies as much as the next guy but before they were a bit more substantial and just tasted better all around. As for the other foods I've tried there, the Chicken sandwich is pretty \"ehhh\", the burgers are fairly good and the BBQ will probably always be this places saving grace since it seems to be good consistently. Also, the beer is reasonably priced and their beer specials seem to be worth checking out from time to time. This Macs does seem to have a nicer patio than the one on South Blvd and on Wednesday nights they run a Cornhole tournament in the summertime. Another for the minus column is parking. If you show up at the wrong time you can pretty much forget parking in their lot and will have to park on a adjacent street and hoof it over to the restaurant. Also, the service here can be spotty at times. All of that being said, I'll probably still end up going there for the time being because it is convenient to my house but if I ever move I seriously doubt I'll make the trip back their way."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, love bring either family, friends, coworkers or really anyone for that matter. Great place to hang out and the bbq sauce you can buy. I always have to buy a bunch when i fo back home because the family loves it!"}
{"text":"Be a fool not to come here. Best place to get bbq and now i dont have to spend a quarter tank of gas to get it with the new location here in Matthews. Beer selection is top notch, girls are good looking and servers are great."}
{"text":"The fastest food order ever! Not bad tasting either. Our server (Annie) was attentive without being a pain in the butt. Overall I'm pretty sure I will return for football viewing."}
{"text":"Great food and a very cool atmosphere to hang out. Portion sizes are huge and we definitely did not leave hungry. We started with the chicken nachos which were large, delicious and a perfect app for all 5 of us to share. BBQ Brisket with cheddar grits, greens and Texas toast was delicious, onion rings were crisp and spicy, BBQ chicken was a very big portion but disappeared quickly as it was succulent and tasty. For dessert we got Banana Pudding which was amazing (not quite in my grandmas level, but close) and the Bourbon Pecan pie which also didn't last long in the table. It was a good place for kids as the outside deck is a good place to run around for a little if they get restless. Our server was attentive and very accommodating for us as well. Next time we are back in town we would definitely stop in again for dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot. Some BBQ places have good BBQ some have good sides, few do as well at both as Mac's.  The portions are large too. The large Platter with two sides is plenty for my wife and I to split, especially after the free hush puppies. The last two times we have gone on Friday and they have local beer specials. Both times we left with a free pint glass from the brewery."}
{"text":"Always great time. The food is consistently good and the service is even better. Kenny and the other bartenders are always fantastic!  The live music on Fridays is a great added bonus."}
{"text":"Really nice bar ambience. The moment we sat down we were given the complimentary hush puppies, which were so delicious, we asked for seconds! The service was pretty good. The food came out fairly quick for a party of 6 & they checked to see if everything was ok multiple times. The honey bbq wings, brisket, brisket wrap, pulled pork sandwich, Mac & cheese, & sweet potato fries were all very good. We had no complaints on any of the food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Was sent here for dinner by my local customers, what a treat!  Sat at their outside bar and enjoyed the service, the food and the weather!  Clearly lots of locals eat here and that is always a good sign.  The barbecue was delicious and I got a lesson on Caroline bbq vs \"the rest\".  It was a great taste of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ I'm a very relaxed environment. We split the BBQ between 3 people and had plenty of food! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch experience with my daughter. Grilled wings were perfect. She had the salad with barbecue and I had the house Cuban. They were expertly prepared and tasted delicious. 
The service was impeccable and chef even came to check on how we enjoyed our food.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fried pickles are the best here.  If this sounds strange, just try them, they are great. The BBQ is great.  Atmosphere is fun, a little loud but still very good place to host a get together. Every time I am in Charlotte I go here.   I will be back."}
{"text":"I think I came in expecting a bit too much, I had been told for literally over a year how amazing this place was with the best macaroni and cheese ever. But I left a bit underwhelmed. Macaroni and cheese tasted more like overcooked butter noodles I think they forgot the cheese. Hush puppies were amazing I would highly recommend! Cocktails were weak, I like to know there alcohol in my drink especially when I'm paying $8 a glass for the tiniest mason jar basically full of ice with a splash of mixer. The coleslaw was good the portions were huge we definitely had a ridiculous amount of left overs to take home. Staff was nice but next time I'm in the area I don't think I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Macs but as of late I have been Disapointed big time. WHen they first opened they set the bar realy high and have not been able to get to that point with there food in a while now. I still go there on a regular basis because even on a bad day they still have the best bbq around but they should really get back to how they were before. It has been a lot of little things as of late. Cold meats and sides, really dry brisket and pork, literally no cheese on the mac and cheese. The other locations have gotten worse as well but the sandy porter location has gotten the worse. The beer list is always pretty good though and the prices are great.

I love Macs and I hope they can turn it around again because we still want to keep going there"}
{"text":"I'm a northerner. BBQ is way different here in the south and boy was I missing out! We love this place so much that when my family comes down they insist that we go here for lunch or dinner at least once!
Never had bad service either. If I didn't like something they always remade :)

This is great BBQ in Cornelius and the environment is always decent."}
{"text":"We ordered the rib catering for 20 people, came with two sides (we chose potato salad and Mac and cheese).  We ordered this for my dad's memorial service as he loved the ribs here.

Food was great and was all ready to go once we arrived.  LOTS of food!  Had plenty of left overs.  Really loved the sides.  Only suggestion is to get the rolls as the Texas toast tends to be 'not so toasty' after being a bit humidified in the aluminum containers that they provide."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, interesting crowd.  BBQ."}
{"text":"Solid three star.

Only go here for bbq if Midwood is too crowded or Sauceman's is closed.  

Otherwise, like your gym teacher always said, 'Why settle for average?'"}
{"text":"Best barbecue pork sandwich in the area! This place is super fast if you know what you want. I've had the little
Pig with Mac and cheese and have been I and out in 10 minutes at lunchtime. The hush puppies are nice and sweet and not too oniony. The smell of the barbecue will be your first hint at how good this will taste."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 7 years so I write this review with a heavy heart.
I ordered my favorite the Brisket Sandwich but it was not as good as it used to be.

Kind of dry and tough. In addition only 2 pieces. They barely covered the Texas Toast. They used to put 3 or 4 pieces on there. 

My friend had the pulled pork bbq sandwich. Once again nothing to write home about.

I'll give the South Blvd location a shot,  but some places after time just live on their reputation. 

You get more for your money and better tasting brisket from Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"This is a must stop anytime traveling through I-77. My dad and I stopped last Saturday and had the brisket wrap again. I live 7 hours away and crave this thing. Beer selection is great and the side are solid as well."}
{"text":"I use to eat gear often. The food is great the service is average nothing special i haven't had the best waitress or bartender. Usually they are just quick and efficient lacking personality. The nachos and wings are perfect starters. The hush puppies are great but they stop coming with the butter which I miss, it was a hit. I've tried just about everything and have no complaints. Make sure you get your points for beer. I typically like to order to go food while I enjoy a beer at the bar just for the experience. My to go order is always on point and they never miss a beat."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed Mac's food at all of there locations. We are soooo happy to have a location here in Matthews! The food is always good and the portions are awesome! The Matthews location has a friendly staff and a great ambiance! FYI anyone that gives a restaurant/bar a bad review due to parking should stay home!!"}
{"text":"Wings were good and spicey...place was talked up way too much. I come from the land of perfect smoked meats (Austin, TX) so they had big shoes to fill....and could not even come close. I would say it's a good place to eat if you are visiting town and just want some decent smoked meats. If you have never been to Austin or had real Texas BBQ then you will like this place."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  They have some of the best fried catfish I've ever tasted. My colleagues loved the ribs and pulled pork.  Stay clear of the coleslaw as a side dish... A great casual place to hang out. A bit messy inside and very loud. Not a great place for desserts. Last time I went there they were using porto potties which isn't cool."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch.  It was my first time here so I was enamored with the garage themed decor and TVs everywhere.  This place serves some good Q.  We opted to sit in their patio area and were promptly greeted by our server.  Drinks came out quickly and I ordered the beer can chicken (half/dark).  It was absolutely delicious.  The chicken skin was a little crispy and there were nice hints of the smoke they used to cook it.  It was so good, I stopped using the barbeque sauces they have on the table.  My sides were the cole slaw and the green bean casserole, both were very good.

Will return next time."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start by saying that I love this place for its service and atmosphere. The sign and facade was not deceiving and it lived up to its reputation as being a great place to go. It was a huge upgrade over the previous nights disastrous outing to Lancaster's. 

Now let's unpack the food. Being new to NC BBQ and it's traditional sides, I found the hush puppies light and crisp with a nice sweetness. The Brunswick Stew was delicious and well seasoned with a rich broth. I will be seeking this out for my home kitchen. Not accustomed to Collard Greens but they were tender and not mushy I'm a light broth. The Mac and Cheese however could use some attention; more cream would help. Pulled pork was on point with good smoke and rub to set it off. The Ribs were over done and provided little yield when biting in to it pulling the entire piece of rib meat off. Contrary to popular belief falling off the bone is a sign of being overdone. Brisket was okay but over done. The sausage was seasoned and cooked to perfection with nice smoke and snap as you bit through the casing. All the sauces were awesome to the extent I bought a sample of each to bring home. 

If you are in the Lake Norman, this is the place you need to go..ciao!"}
{"text":"We took my coworker here for his birthday because he'd been raving about how much he loved this place. And maybe it's another one of those \"wrong time...wrong day\" experiences but this place just didn't do it for me.

We arrived a little after 11am and the place was already starting to get busy. For me that's always a great sign!  We were seated in a booth by the outside patio and here's the first major downside...there were flies everywhere. I guess since the door kept being opened and it was so hot this was to be expected but it's nothing I hate more than eating inside and having to swat and cover my food. 

Our waitress came over and greeted us and my coworkers and I are still trying to figure out if she was \"new\" or just completely \"lost\" but service was horrible. Our drinks weren't refilled, there were a couple of orders came out wrong and the process of paying was a real disaster. I won't bore you with the details just know I was not impressed at all. 

But on to the food, I ordered the Lil' pig (pork BBQ sandwich) and macaroni and cheese. The BBQ was just okay. It just wasn't anything special. I did enjoy trying all the different sauces on the table. The slaw was meh. But I'm not really a slaw lover. The real downer was the mac and cheese...so bland and tasteless. My coworker said normally it doesn't taste like that so I'm thinking it was just the first batch of the day and they just were rushing and maybe missed some seasoning. Who knows?!

I'll put it like this if my coworkers suggests this place again I'd come back and give them another chance but it's definitely not high on my list."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner of the BBQ plate, chicken, sausage , pork it was very good ! Mac n cheese was okay. The potato salad was excellent. Waitress pushed a couple beers that were
Lousy a creation that was supposed to taste like a Girl Scout cookie. Lousy but their IPA was a good one!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Mac's Speed Shop was mixed.  Not at all because of the food, because it was EXCELLENT but the restaurant/bar/whatever it is, was SO LOUD I couldn't hear my friend chatting across the table.  Maybe it's not always like that, but last night it was very noisy!  

Our waitress was great - attentive and very helpful, never had an empty glass.  We ordered the fried pickle appetizer, which was okay, probably good, but I'm not a huge dill pickle fan in any case.  We both ordered the \"A Little Bit o' Stuff\" platter, which was anything but little and I barely made a dent in the food and took a whole container of food home for leftovers!  For $16 it's a great deal - choice of four meats and two sides...I had chicken, bbq, brisket and ribs with mac and cheese (all you've read about this mac and cheese is true, it was AMAZING) and a side salad.  He had the same meat choices with green bean casserole instead of salad.  Everything was tender and delicious and I loved it!

I took the 5th star simply because of the volume of noise....between the live band and the chatter - it was super distracting.  I would probably give the outside seating area a try next time...or just go for take out.  

Food - Great    Service - Great ....check it out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place.  Fun décor.  Fantastic service.  Spectacular beer list.  The food was consistently very good, especially the apps.  Don't miss out on the burnt ends, they were the highlight.  The only thing that stops me from rating it 5-stars is that the pulled pork was a little on the dried out side and could have been a bit more flavorful.  Then again, their excellent sauces came to the rescue and made for a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"A group of 6 at 8 on Sat night ordered wings as appetizer and they arrived cold and were soft like they had been boiled. Teriyaki Flavor was good.  3 BBQ plates and 2 chicken plates all were cold.  We were so hungry only two got sent back.  The hamburger was good and came out hot.  Second try on wings and they were cold too and my side of onion rings became a ring and a half.  Third try and still cold.   They have serious kitchen issues.   The manager tried to make it right and they were extremely nice and comp'd the wings, the 2 plates we sent back and took half off the others.  He did try and I'll give them credit for that.  The cold food is perplexing to me."}
{"text":"Wow! We just ate the BEST wings we've ever had! They smoke them and then grill them, not fry, and there a lot of choices for the sauce. We had the VTX chipotle and it was just the right amount of sweet and spice (medium). What a great place! Lots of choices for draft beers as well as bottles. Many local beers to choose from.
You have to have these wings!
We may just have to drive up here from Rock Hill when we have a hankering for some wings."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Sandy Porter Mac's almost since it opened. For the first 6 months they were out of this world! Huge portions, great service and amazing food. Since then its been great but not like then. Now recently they have a new kitchen manager. On a recent stop my wife got the little pig and onion rings and the rings were cold and tough. Had a gift card which they originally said that they couldn't  take cause their machine wasn't working right! Eventually the manager fixed it all, but this is not the same Macs no more. Scoped many other reviews to see I am not alone. Mac's please go back to the way you used to be!"}
{"text":"Had the small Pulled Pork BBQ with two sides (collards and Brunswick Stew). Was phenomenal. The serving size was good as well -- plenty."}
{"text":"It was ok - bbq and brisket was dry - service was non existent - had to search for a server for more Coke and tea."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!! It's so good!!! The Beef Brisket was perfect!!!  Free Hush Puppies with your order.    I would definitely go back here and here again. But just be sure Be early because it's always packed full of people."}
{"text":"So so happy to have this new addition to Mac's Speed Shop open near me. Its a great addition to the area as our options are limited. Terrific choice for lunch, dinner, drinks, sports watching venue. Wait staff was excellent and orders were taken swiftly and delivered quickly. Beverages refilled often. Complimentary homemade hush puppies hot and moist delivered at seating. The salad offerings are amazing and heartily portioned. The Brunswick stew was perfect for a chilly day. Menu options offer so much from bbq plates to tacos and on to entree style salads. Prices are reasonable and make this a great value for a frequent work lunch or social gathering spot after work or before big night out. I'm looking forward to being known as a \"regular\" at this awesome place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner this evening and was extremely disappointed.  Having visited the Southend location several times, I'm fairly certain that the Cornelius location can not compare in anyway.

First, the $4 margarita special is a joke. It tasted like straight sour mix and ice and fortunately my husband figured out that adding water to the drink may it drinkable.

The complimentary hushpuppies and service was o.k., and my small \"lil pig\" sandwich was pretty good. 

Mac and Cheese lacked flavor...similar to a previous review, the macaroni was slimy and the cheese was non-existant.  

Husband ordered the brisket and I felt so bad for him.  I tasted it and it was very much over cooked and tough as cardboard.  DISGUSTING!  And for $16?!?! C'mon Mac's get it together!!  

Safe to say that we will never return.  Guess it is worth the 30 minute wait at Taco Mac next time."}
{"text":"As always, Mac's was good! This was my first time at the Lake Norman location, and our server was extremely friendly and attentive. 

My wife and I split the South Loop burger as well as the pulled pork platter. The waitress made sure to inform us all burgers our made in house and it'd be about 20 minutes total because of that, so expect a slightly longer waiter. 

The burger turned tasted great (albeit slightly overcooked), and the pulled pork was some of the best I've had from Mac's. Mac & Cheese is just like granny used to make, and the hush puppies smothered in that sweet cream butter are divine."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and bartenders are on top of things. Good beer selection and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant BBQ I've ever had in my entire life. I got the beef brisket (lean and fatty mix) with baked potato salad and green bean casserole. Everything from the BBQ sauce, to the tiny hint of spicy in the green bean casserole, to the loaded baked potato type potato salad was incredible. My boyfriend got the beef rib and it was fall apart in your mouth delicious. He got collard greens and mac & cheese for sides and loved them too. I also got the Mac's Spiked Tea to drink. Not super strong but pretty good for a variation of a Long Island iced tea. The Tabasco fried pickles were the best fried pickles I've had also-not soggy and the breeding didn't fall off which usually happens at other restaurants. We will 100% make the 2.5 hour trip from Augusta, GA and come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the brisket (lean) with two sides and it was pretty darn tasty.   Service was excellent, my waitress Laura was very attentive.  Dinner + 2 glasses of wine was $28.   This place is very LOUD at dinner time.   They had TVs going (with the Olympics on) and there's lots of patron noise.   
Overall, food was good and I would go back for it!"}
{"text":"Bbq food was ok, the meat was dry but did fall off the bone. The Mac n cheese was pretty good though, you should eat it while it's hot. The cheese will melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and was pretty pleased with the taste and price of my meal. I tried the pulled pork platter and it had the right amount of spiciness. The sauces are tasty as well. Macaroni was not as jazzy as reviews stated, but it sufficed, yet the greens were very good. The tight tank wearing servers could be a little more attentive, so service is okay. I look forward to trying some more of the menu items(e.g. brisket, beer can chicken)"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ spot in Matthews. Open door patio, great staff, and atmosphere. Burnt ends and charred wings  are a favorite of ours. Huge selection of beer. Great place to have a beer with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious Bloody Mary cocktails! The nachos were tasty with a lot of cheesy deliciousness! The Mac and cheese is seriously on point! Happy that it's close enough to walk to!!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor spot.  Tables are dirty outside.  Salad was just so so.  I like the atmosphere.  Not really my kind of spot."}
{"text":"Beef Ribs were really good, a little tougher than I like them but the flavor was awesome. The Onion Rings were some of the best I've ever had. I took off two stars because the Mac and Cheese was not creamy enough and the St. Louis Ribs were tough and lacked a good smoke flavor."}
{"text":"Here's the deal for me at Mac's...great beer selection, good sides and the main selections are hit and miss.  The ribs are overrated...tough.  BBQ isn't up to NC standards.  The Brunswick stew is watery..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a couple months ago. The food was pretty tasty. It's a bar environment so a bit noisy, but overall a very good experience there. I only cared for 1 style of the BBQ sauce though. For having the BEST BBQ in town, I wasn't blown away. To each her own..."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, good atmosphere, good beer. Very happy that Mac's has a Lake Norman outpost. Try the macaroni and cheese and cole slaw, skip the brownie."}
{"text":"Hello beautiful.

We first started going to Mac's because it was close by and we heard they had good BBQ. We started drooling before we even sat down because of the long line of constantly rotating taps (they even do something of a themed seasonal changing of taps each month.)
Then we got our food. Now just repeat that last sentence about 153 times, as we go here often and have NEVER had a bad meal. It also doesn't hurt that they have the best fried pickles in Charlotte.

I think the best way to sum this review up is that every time we have guests in town we take them to Mac's. Last time my dad was down we went to Mac's four times. In one week."}
{"text":"Yeah, Mac's definitely has awesome Mac-n-cheese and I like their onion rings too.  I don't eat pork or beef so I can't comment on their BBQ,  but they have plently of other things on the menu that I can eat.  Be warned, the place gets packed on the weekends - especially when the weather is nice!  As far as the \"biker bar vibe\",  you will definitely see just as many  \"yuppy cars\" in the parking lot as you see motorcycles!  Service can be hit or miss, but this is not a place that you come for \"great service\" - it's just a fun, relaxed place to go for a beer and a quick bite...and if you're into sports, its a good spot to watch a game with a lively crowd."}
{"text":"I had a Baja salad. It was excellent with very fresh ingredients. It Has more veggies than most typical salads. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte, I just heard that Mac's Speed Shop was the place to go to BBQ and went to the one on South Blvd since that was the first one to show up on my search.  Little did I realize there was a Mac's right by where I live here in Steele Creek!  The first thing my husband and I said was, \"Oh NO!  We are going to get so fat!!\"

I absolutely LOVE Mac's and everything about it.  The food, of course, comes first and is spot on with reasonable prices, big portions and tons of flavor.  I'm a sucker for cheese & grits and theirs is awesome.  Last time I was there, my husband and I split the combo platter to get a little bit of everything and we were so happy we did.  The server also recommended we try their banana pudding, and though we were skeptical, our bowl was empty by the time the check came.

The service here is always really friendly and attentive which I can appreciate even when they are busy and have a lot of customers.  They also have drink specials every night, even on the weekends, which is another nice incentive to spend your money here than elsewhere.

This is definitely going to be our go-to spot for our BBQ cravings and so glad we found one so close to home!"}
{"text":"This place had a nice buzz from when we first walked in.  There was a band playing outside that just added to the electricity.   We were told that they had a huge variety of micro brews.  That was an understatement.   The had many great choices on tap and bottle.  The service was good and the food was very enjoyable.   They had a bunch of TV's to watch the NCAA Tournament.  This is a place that I will try again.........nice experience."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Cornelius. The quality of food is awesome, you will not be disappointed. Good beer selection, great atmosphere, better food."}
{"text":"I needed the steak knife they gave me to cut the brisket!!! This is truly terrible brisket. The sauce was good, but it was hard and chewy. Would be good as jerky. The wings were great and loved the NC Sauce. Chips and salsa with pimento cheese were okay, and the cheese grits were good too. Tried the Carolina Stew and that was forgettable (tasted like canned minestrone soup). The terrible brisket (3 small slices for $18) just ruined the entire meal. Shame on you, Mac's. I can't believe you would even plate it for a customer and consider it edible."}
{"text":"Went here today after not being in the area for 3 years. The onion rings were awesome and $2 Miller Lites were a bonus! The baked potato salad was also amazing. Disappointed with the brisket, typically it is so tender that you can cut it with your fork, not the case today. I had to use a knife to cut the meat. Not a horrible experience but certainly not what I had experienced the last time I visited."}
{"text":"Best melt in your mouth Brisket in the southeast. and i love the sauce."}
{"text":"Good quick food! Decent bbq for a chain! My out of town family love to come here and I love that the beers rotate so even though we live close by and come often we never get tired of it!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few times with co-workers while on a business trip in Charlotte.  The first time I ate there I thought is was great.  I had the beer can chicken with the chipotle wing sauce.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The mac and cheese is great as well.  The second time I went there I ordered the same thing, including the collard greens.  The chicken was dry and lacked flavor.  The collard greens are a bit juicy for my taste.  Seemed there was a lot of water in the bowl.  The mac and cheese was consistent.  The third time I went there I tried the wings.  These were ok.  They did not seem to have much flavor from the chipotle wing sauce.  Maybe they did not have enough sauce on them.  They were not anything to brag about.  What I can say is that this place is inconsistent with the food.  Sometimes the meal is great and sometimes it is less than good.  I visited more than twice because of co-workers wanting to eat there.  I will never make the decision to go there again."}
{"text":"Ribs were terrible.. Had thick hammy texture and taste. Collards and onion rings were good."}
{"text":"Really great place. Lots of beers on tap. BBQ is tasty. Just as good as the Uptown location."}
{"text":"Great barbecue restaurant! Has a cool motorcycle style. Huge beer selection on tap. We got there and it only took us about 15 minutes to be seated, get a drink, and get our food. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place isn't a 5 on everyones charts. I stayed at the Comfort Inn next door (20% discount for me at the restaurant because I stayed there). I had multiple meals here and the number one thing to get:

Wings...VTX Chipotle. Amazing. It's not just the sauce though. The amazing part of the wings are they are smoked for 6 hrs. So when you go to eat them, they fall apart. Do yourself a favor and get these."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked chicken platter! It was flavorful and juicy! The mac n' cheese was some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant. It was perfectly cooked, just the right amount of cheese and wasn't overly seasoned. For the craft beer aficionado, they have over 60 varieties of beer- can, bottle, draft."}
{"text":"I love Mac's dearly but when we went for dinner yesterday was some of the worst service I've had in a long time. The food was great (like it always is) but the waitress was really bitchy and was just confusing. She brought us apps we didn't order and said \"These were all the hush puppies we had left so I just brought them.\" And we're like \"we didn't order these\" and she was like \"I know.\" and just walked away... When someone would want to order she would look at them and just keep walking by. I'll definitely be back to Mac's but I hope I never get what's her face as a waitress again. Also we had 10 people and got put at a table with 8 spots and had to add (broken) chairs on the ends to fit everyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Mac's in Mathews but the food and service were top notch. My waitress Nina made a great suggestion on the beef brisket sandwich and mac n cheese. Damn son that shit was good. She was very nice and always kept my drink full and got me my food fast. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great place, came here with family because had great reviews. You will not be disappointed. On our way back from skiing we stop again, love it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken wings. Best we have experienced in awhile and didn't expect this as an option on the menu. BBQ is amazing and the sides are good portions."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Not exactly like the original on South Blvd. but it's close and has AWESOME apple pie!  The mac n cheese is also very tasty.  Also found out it's a Steelers bar on Sundays!  Might have to go there more often now.

Mac's also caters to bikers but I don't think this location is as big as a biker bar as the one on South."}
{"text":"Not making hush puppies because understaffed??  It's not even busy in here at 4:15pm.  Very disappointed since I love their hush puppies.  Brisket kinda dry...order with the fat, MUCH better (waitress should have asked which way we wanted them...always have before...then I would have remembered).  Green bean casserole & cheese grits very good.  But still wanted my hush puppies...can you tell I'm not over that???

**UPDATE** Redeemed by manager.  My delicious hush puppies arrived, even though end of meal, AND an offer for more brisket...fat included!   

I come all the way to this specific location as I like it over any other."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and wanted some good BBQ and this place came highly recommended.  I have to say the Catfish was great! We'll seasoned and absolutely delicious. ...yummy Mac & Cheese and pulled pork. The ribs were tasty and fell off the bone.  I did have a spoonful of the bake beans but they were too sweet for me but still pretty good. I would be eating here again and the price is right."}
{"text":"My husband and j came here last Friday night and will never return. We sat at the bar and for 15 mins received no service! No one said hello asked us if we wanted to order a drink or anything. Needless to say we left. Will never return to the restaurant due to horrible experience"}
{"text":"The Texas beef sausage with onion rings and mac & cheese was amazing.  Try it with some of the Mac's Red BBQ Sauce.  So good!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Very cool atmosphere and very good food. Service was great and prompt even with the huge crowd."}
{"text":"I wish I could love Macs as much as everyone else does. I frequently go to this location because the attitudes are way better here than the South blvd one. The service is great but unfortunately the food just never hits the spot for me. 
One: the sausage and pimento crackers are so good but, one had a hair on it. So sad.
Two: my salad is always big, full of goodies and comes out fast. No complaints. 
Three: Banana pudding was probably the worst I've ever had and I love almost anything. I hate to say it but, the whipped cream had NO flavor and it tasted like water.. 
I wish I could love it, but the stars are for the service."}
{"text":"I work in southend and I've been here maybe 10-12 times over the past year. It's a great spot. Parking can sometimes be a little bit tricky, especially during peak times like weekends or lunch. Overall, the food is good. You're usually seated immediately and don't have to wait for anybody to acknowledge your presence. The staff is overall friendly and courteous. Pretty good spot to go to. If you like tacos, their buffalo chicken tacos are awesome and only $4 each. That's usually what I get when I go."}
{"text":"I honestly try to never leave a bad review. Me and my daughter went Sunday afternoon. We placed out order food was out to the table in less than 2 minutes which set off the first alarm. Still trying to be positive I took a bite. The food was Ice cold just like it had been in the fridge all day, I was like how is this possible even the plate was cold, I looked at my daughter and I could tell by the look in her eyes she had the same thing. Our waitress finally comes back and shes like well I'll warm it for you. At this point Im like thanks but no thanks. We just left. I dont know how this place has any positive reviews"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everytime I eat here I get exactly what I ordered and more than enough food! The service has been fantastic and very friendly! Food is wonderful too! Beer and Ciders are outstanding."}
{"text":"Always good. Have been going to the South Blvd location since it opened. This spot is the old Vinnie's raw bar and is laid out really nice, one side open air with a roof and one side with a bar and lots of tables and high tops like the South & Steele Creek locations. Lotsa staff to take care of the constant crowds and the food is absolutely worth AT LEAST one visit. We've gone there many, many times."}
{"text":"Wow, the breaded catfish is HUUUUUGE. Greenville SC needs to add this asap. Tartar sauce has a nice bite to it."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience at Mac's.  Our waitress was outstanding - the kind of service you hope to get everytime you go out to dinner.  They have a huge outdoor seating area, with a variety of bar stool type seating as well as picnic tables with umbrellas. 

We started with the hush puppies served with some type of butter sauce and the fried pickles - both were incredible.  I had the grilled chicken BBQ sandwich - which they allow you to pick from about 20 different additions to the sandwich with no additional cost, which really impressed me.  Everyone at the table was very satisfied with the food/service and we would definitely recommend it to anyone around the Ayrsley area of Charlotte. Check out Mac's!"}
{"text":"First time here and great experience!!
Great greeting...prompt seating...quick drinks (alcohol and non-alcohol). 
Server was great.  Very pleasant and informative.  
Had fried pickles as an app...A+
Had pulled pork platter as entree...B++
Will definitely return.  Keep up the good work Mac!!"}
{"text":"I'm rating Mac's Speed Shop 2 STARS for HORRIBLE customer service. Now, don't get me wrong, I've been here plenty of times to both eat & drink, but this time, I was introduced to the waitress Amanda who was extremely rude. 

So, my friend and I live in South End right across the street from this establishment so we go here quite often, but I've never been treated with such distain. We ordered our food and I got 
the Spark Plug burger which is a 10 oz. burger, pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapeños, applewood smoked bacon, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomato, & onion. I added guacamole and a whole bunch of other items which I think began the hatred towards us. From that point on, Amanda was rude, never checked on us, and just basically acted like we were the scum of the earth (we're paying customers, I thought). 

We get our food and it's just the way I like it. I have no complaints about the food. It was a delicious burger. My friend and I finish eating and she brings our checks w/o us even asking did we want anything else. Now, this is where the 2 stars come in. She puts my friends check down on the table and literally THROWS MY CHECK @ ME and walks away!! We both looked @ each other in astonishment. Not only was that rude, but I wasn't done ordering. I wanted another beer, so I literally had to look @ the check for her name to get her attention to place my drink order. She gets an attitude from that. So, my friend pays and she takes the thrown check back b/c she has to update my receipt with my extra drink order. AMANDA never comes back so I get up and proceed to go to the hostess stand to pay/speak with someone. She yells and say \"YOU DIDN'T PAY YOUR BILL\" and I respond \"You never brought it back\". So, I hand her my card and pay for my order per usual, but I leave her two tips: 

1) Monetary compensation even though she didn't deserve it. 
2) Don't throw checks @ the people that help put food on your table. 

Conclusively, I will still go back b/c they have excellent food, but I don't want to deal with Amanda ever. 

Side Note: I went to the bar last Sunday and didn't get good service @ all. The only thing I did was have two Blue Moons, but since it was 11:00pm and they were about to close @ midnight, the bartender was not paying us any attention. So, Mac's Speed Shop, PLEASE, get some better servers or adopt a better training program b/c they will be the death of you. 

Thanks!

{"text":"Great place to sit outside, have some good at a decent price and enjoy a variety beers/wines.   Staff was very friendly and music is classic rock selections."}
{"text":"Mac's has pretty good BBQ. The beef rib is delicious (and huge). My wife really enjoys the salads. There are a lot of beer options here too. This location has less of a biker atmosphere than the one on South Boulevard."}
{"text":"First time patron. Food was outstanding...wings were great with a nice smokey flavor and very meaty. Cuban sandwich was very tasty.  Other folks at our table had the pulled pork sandwich and all thought it was outstanding.  We will definitely be back.  Service was very nice and quick."}
{"text":"When I think about Carolina bbq, Mac's Speed Shop immediately pops into my head.  Although I've dined at less than a handful of bbq joints in Charlotte, Mac's is ranked #1 for me.  Shortly after being seated, warm hush puppies with a side of whipped butter are brought to your table.  These puppies have a crunchy outside and a soft center and seem to melt in your mouth.  Good luck only eating a few! My go-to pick on the menu is always the Hickory Smoked & Pulled Pork BBQ, which comes with two sides- I choose the salad and the mac & cheese.  I love that they ask if you want all of the fixings on your salad.  The mac & cheese is like a taste of heaven....cheesy, gooey and creamy elbow macaroni with a crispy top.  I salivate just thinking about it.  The pork is dry rubbed and hickory wood smoked for 12 hrs and is so tender and flavorful.  There is various sauces on the table for you to adorn your meat with, ranging from Carolina vinegar based to a much sweeter version (what I prefer).  I am eager to give other dishes a try, although it will be difficult to stray from my norm!"}
{"text":"If you're craving BBQ in Charlotte, then you gotta come here!! You get served a basket of hush puppies with the best dip in the world-- bacon maple honey butter. It was sooo mouth watering and I wish that I could buy a whole jar of it so I can spread it on everything! 

We then ordered the combo platter to share. You get to choose 4 meats and 2 sides. We picked the St Louis ribs, pulled pork, beer can chicken and braised beef. For sides, we picked the Brunswick stew and green bean casserole. The St Louis ribs were great--equally as delicious as the ones at Midwood! The pulled pork is one of their most popular dishes and is a must-try! Both the green bean casserole had the perfect amount of crispiness and the Brunswick stew was a beef stew with an explosion of flavors.

All in all, I liked Mac's Speed Shop a tad bit more than Midwood Smokehouse because it was more reasonable in price and it came with a free side of hush puppies + amazing dip! If you only have time to try one place for BBQ in Charlotte, then I high recommend Mac's Speed Shop!!"}
{"text":"The girls from work decided to try this spot out for lunch and since I haven't been in several years we decided to refresh our memory of this place and again it was just ok for me some things were pretty good others just ok.  This place gets really busy around the lunch hour and parking fills up really quickly, so avoid the rush if you can.  The staff was quick to come over and take our order and the food was coming out in no time which makes this place great for lunch as they realize folk want to be in and out for lunch. I couldn't really decide on anything so I went with the side combo of Brunswick stew, green bean casserole, and collards with texas toast no complaints the sides were all pretty good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I eat from this location every week,  maybe more.  I love love love the BBQ.  I normally get the Lil Pig with Mac and cheese.  Delicious!!  Wings are good as well and love the hush puppies there.  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  Wait staff is great.  I have also ordered to go and pickup and always ready when I arrive."}
{"text":"Ordered the \" Big \" BLT, the only thing big about it was the price, really folks, I am not one to complain but this sandwich was a complete rip off, I have gotten more bacon on a $2.99 sandwich at QT."}
{"text":"Bit disappointed in this one. Had friends in from out of town and we raved about macs. Service was slow, I was given the wrong food, nothing came out at the same time, causing us to wait to eat. Needless to say the food wasn't as good.

Fans were turned up on high and blowing down on the food and you. Asked the manager to turn them down, took 20 minutes to get that done.

We'll come back but it will be a while."}
{"text":"Food so good you'll want to slap someone ! This place has hands down the best of the BBQ in the area! 
From the minute you walk in the door your nose will smell the delicious aroma of that juicy delicious food. 
My first few visits were to go - mainly because I couldn't trust myself in public to eat that savory Q without getting it all over myself!
The sides oh the sides are so yummy . 
Today's meal was BBQ ribs with coleslaw and Mac and cheese. 
So good ! 
If you haven't made your way to a location... I'd say you're missing out big time !

Macs is the place for yummy BBQ in CHARLOTTE and one of the few places that's served beef ribs ! 
Thanks Macs !!! Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"This is a review of a BBQ place through the eyes of a vegetarian (aka what happens when you're outnumbered by carnivores). 

Ordered the fried pickles with ranch sauce as an appetizer - pretty good. A little salty but the taste of the fried pickles and ranch sauce was pretty perfect. Pickles are sliced like coins, not kept long/cylindrical then fried. That's one thing I noticed. Made it a little harder to dip In the tub of ranch.

I ordered the black bean burger and the Mac n' Cheese as a side. 

The black bean burger wasn't so much of a burger as it much of a sloppy joe. The burger itself was too mushy for my liking. The guacamole was DELICIOUS as a topping on the burger. So were the mushrooms. I approve the variety of toppings/\"fixins\" that they had available.

Mac n' cheese... like many of these reviews state... was pretty awesome. You should probably get this as a side if you can.

The service was okay - I think it was a little difficult to catch the waitress' eye for the check. She came by quite a bit on her own during the meal to ask if everything was good though, which I appreciated.

Oh also, we randomly got a basket of hush puppies? First time I've ever tried them but they were great. Good job."}
{"text":"Our weekly Friday night go-to!! We love it here!  Such a great and easy place to go and have a few drinks and great food.  The wine prices are fantastic and they always have a beer special running.  Hush puppies are given to us every time and we almost always get the tobacco fried pickles.  My fav is the catfish po boy and SO glad they have the green bean casserole!!  My hubby loves the burnt ends, the little pig and especially the mac and cheese.

We usually sit at the bar on Friday nights and the bar staff is fantastic- fast and friendly service and they even remember us and our favorites!

It gets busy so go early if you don't want to wait for a table.  We enjoy sitting at the bar and have no problem finding seating there even late in the dinner rush.  They usually have live music, also!"}
{"text":"Disappointing... This is the second time I've had Mac's takeout and have been disappointed. The portions were smaller than expected and the order wasn't correct. We ordered shrimp tacoS, but only received one. While it's an appetizer, it's not represented as a serving of one taco on the website menu. Additionally, the order was checked before it was handed to us, only for us to discover that the order was incorrect when we got home. We had to return to the restaurant to pick up the missing pork belly.

The staff was nice, but they didn't seem particularly apologetic or attempt to make amends for the fact that we had to come back for the missed item that had been paid for. It would have been nice to have them offer a coupon, discount, or complimentary item. 

The food overall wasn't fantastic (pork was dry and the taco was very runny) and I probably wouldn't return to dine in or carryout."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was packed.  I ended up going with the Chainsaw's BBQ Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onion and pimento cheese with a side of fries.  The sandwich was really good.  I was impressed with how there pimento cheese mixed with the BBQ flavor.  The fries were cooked well.  With the Chainsaw's BBQ sandwich you can choose from a list of toppings, it's basically like creating your own sandwich.   I liked this place a lot, the service is great and food is priced really well.  Plus they have numerous amounts of different types of beer.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place completely fell off, the smoked chicken that I ordered was undercooked and it tasted like lighter fluid. So I gave it back and ordered pulled pork which didn't taste good at all. The bowl of chili that I had was cold in temperature. I used to love the green bean casserole here, but even that doesn't taste good anymore. The only good thing about this was that the server was really nice, and manager helpful too. It's not there fault their cook was terrible so I still left a good tip."}
{"text":"Driving around NC one weekend and decided to try this out. Good lunch, good beer selection and very low key vibe. Pulled pork and brisket were yummy. Enjoyed the bbq sauce and ended up ordering them and shipping one of each back to California. The South Carolina mustard based sauce was my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, so this is tough for me to admit, but the BBQ here is pretty dang delicious. The pulled pork especially was my absolute favorite. It was moist, flavorful, and marries so well with the variety of sauces available! 

I went there with my family and got the variety platter to share with another person. It was definitely more than enough for 2 people. I got the pulled pork, brisket, sausage, ribs, and chicken with a side of mac and cheese and sweet potato fries - all of this for around $20! This was such a great deal! You get so much for such a good price! 

The chicken, brisket, and sausage was okay. It was a bit dry and not as moist as I would have like it, but the pulled pork and the ribs were amazing! If I went back, I would just get those 2. The mac and cheese was also superb and the sweet potato fries were average. 

I just love the portion sizes they have for you and the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Start with the off-menu hush puppies and honey butter. Move to a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork. Texas toast and baked beans are a must, also. Save some room for banana pudding - REAL banana pudding. 

Macs is a great BBQ joint with great live music (sometimes too loud if you just want to talk) and there are always some hogs parked out front to give it that authenticity of a biker bar. Plenty of TVs for sports if you're looking for that."}
{"text":"I order their very fresh homemade Southern style  mac 'n cheese and beer can chicken. Food arrives fresh and rather fast.   The food quality is very consistent. I am a regular here and consider Mac's one of my favorite eating establishments. Atmosphere very much a casual bar with biker theme. Lots of tables to eat outside. Live music at certain times and always interesting cars shows and bikes in the parking lot.  There are other locations around Charlotte."}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork with Mac n cheese and onion Rings. Boyfriend got catfish, Everything was good! Hostesses didn't seem like they knew what they were doing though. Tried to sit me at a high top table with an infant car seat"}
{"text":"We are definitely fans. The service and food were all excellent when we visited. Plus, there is a large beer selection to make this a great happy hour/hang out spot. This is a mix of sports bar and bbq joint and its definitely a laid back atmosphere. There's tables, bar seating and outdoor seating to accommodate a range of people as well. 

The menu is kinda eclectic. You can choose from wings, salads, tacos/quesadillas, bbq, and ribs. We tried the fried pickles, brisket sandwich, pulled pork, and a carnitas taco. We were pleased with them all, although the pickles could have been a bit more crispy for my husband's liking. 

The location is close to my husband's office, so he definitely plans to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around Charlotte after a medical appointment trying to find somewhere we can both agree on to eat. Of course I went to Yelp and looked at the area we were circling. Knowing that my husband will always try barbecue I happened upon Mac's. It wasn't far away and so we started our journey. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the menu and was even more surprised after trying the food.

The barbecue was moist without running with sauce. I found the staff to be very friendly and although they were very busy with a large lunch crowd we did not wait long for service or our food. The inside of this restaurant is decorated similarly to a biker bar. There is not a lot of parking in the area and a couple of places will tow you so be careful.

The brisket was so flavorful and had just enough fat to make it moist without leaving a greasy taste in your mouth.  

The collards were delightful.  Perfectly cooked.

I noticed in 2017 they won Whole Hog at Memphis in May. That is a very telling honor

Lastly want to talk about their menu. They have a slew of sides, wings, Mexicue, sauce to go, beer, cider, and barbecue of all kinds.  This is a place you can bring Grandma, Mom, uncle, teenagers, kids and yourself and everyone will always find something to eat."}
{"text":"I definitely like this location better than the Southend location.. Waitress was more attentive and chit/chat with us a bit. 

I ordered the pull pork sandwich with Mac and cheese. Used a little of sweet bbq. And it was good.  Mac and cheese made me happy.. 

My girlfriends ordered the grand nachos. Not a lot of fixings to the nachos. But definitely mile high. 

For dessert: I ordered the brownie with ice cream. Omg it's sooo good. The brownie was slightly warm and the ice cream was a vanilla bean flavor. All and all I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible and had to wait 20 minutes for the check and the place wasn't very busy and plenty of staff."}
{"text":"Brought a large group there on a weeknight. With a large group of teenagers. They handled our group with ease and the food was fantastic. I got the little bit of everything platter and everything was delicious. I particularly recommend the ribs!"}
{"text":"2nd time and 2 times amazing!  Service is outstanding, food comes out fresh, hot and lightening fast, sauces are Yummarama and it's a great value/large portions!  Oh yah, the hush puppies are super tasty which they serve complimentary. Overall exceptional experience the only thing that everyone didn't rave above were the fried pickles, we just didn't expect them to be soooo spicy. What we did rave about was the pulled pork sand (xl one is PLENTY To split), the brisket, ribs and pulled turkey. We will def be back! Omg I almost forgot to brag about the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Mac's knows what's up. I have tried just about everything on the menu and they know exactly what they're doing. It's always cooked just right. Their pulled pork needs a little extra sauce, but that's just personal preference. The mac n cheese and green bean casserole tastes like grandma made it. Some of the best pulled pork I've ever had. The sandwiches and tacos are pretty good too. If you have family or friends visiting you here in Charlotte, make sure you take them here."}
{"text":"There may be a 5 star here. It's a rough biker bar, with a family spirit perhaps. But, it's a theme restaurant with a BBQ and biker theme. The food is excellent. Try the Apple a bread Pudding with Carmel. Yum! I could start with that!"}
{"text":"This was our third time  here, and honestly I was pretty disappointed.   We LOVED the first two trips, but this was shaky! 5 of us were crammed into a corner booth! Also we had like 3 or 4 flies at our table.  Gross.  

The food was definitely amazing, but they messed up our drink order.   Should have more than drink menu at a table too. 

Well go back because the food is awesome, but we'll probably sit outside, inside was kind of dirty."}
{"text":"I like Mac's especially their South Blvd location.  What I don't like is the hightop wood stools--grossly uncomfortable.  Even though we arrived at 11:40 a.m. our request for table seating was denied since it was just two of us.     Arghhh.

Our wings were good as was the green bean casserole (that recipe is worth stealing); however, the mac-n-cheese and onion rings were duds lacking depth of flavor and love.  Skimpy and wimpy.

I'm going to nit-pik, but I hate the aluminum serving trays and containers.  It reminds me of  feeding our dogs when I was kid--everytime.  I just cannot escape the look and feel.  As soon as my food is plopped down I want to whistle and say, \"Barney and Dutchess, time to eat.\"

3 stars for decent smoky wings, but the hard-ass stools, mediocre sides, and the dog trays whisper just loudly enough \"keep searching.\""}
{"text":"This place is amazinggggggggggggg. I tried the mix platter. Brownies and extra ice cream. Even the chicken wings were delicious. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Had tried the South Blvd. location so I wanted to give the one in Matthews a turn since it is closer to me now. It wasn't as good. That's not to say it wasn't good because it was, just not AS good.
I appreciated the fact that there were many beers to choose from and they seemed to have a special just about every day.
All the chairs are high back and that can get a little uncomfortable.
I ordered the big bbq sandwich and had fries as my side. Before my food came out, I was offered some hush puppies. They tasted like they were fried that morning. The first thing I noticed about my sandwich was that the bread was hard. Thankfully the waitress was available to fix it for me. Not what you would expect for $10 though.
The bbq itself was tasty. It had a strong smoky flavor but that's they way I like it. If you don't like it super smoky you might want to get yours someplace else like Sonny's. The fries were fine and I enjoyed the sauces. It would be nice though if they had one with a spicy kick.
Maybe I should go back and try the brisket? I've read that it's the best. So overall a good experience, just not great."}
{"text":"Had the Cuban for lunch, and it was delicious.  This a good place to try Carolina BBQ.  I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We dined here on a warm Thursday evening. It was awesome to be able to sit outside at the long picnic tables. Our waitress was very nice but overly attentive. She came by every few minutes asking if everything was okay, etc. When you are trying to relax and have a conversation, it gets a little annoying. Not bad having attentive service, but just a little over the top :) 

Now, the food was what brought this place down a couple stars. It all sounded good, but the items we had were either lackluster or simply not good. 

The good:
-Grits. Just awesome. The highlight of the meal. 

The okay:
-Smoked wings. They did have a great smoke flavor and the dry rub allowed the smoke to really be tasted. However, they were soggy. I have had smoked and grilled wings plenty of time, and it's possible to get the wings crispy. These were just flimsy.
-Greens side. Tasty, albeit a little too salty. 

The not good:
-Deviled eggs. Probably the most boring deviled eggs we've ever had. Tasted soapy.

The place deserves 2.5 stars. I couldn't justify giving it an A-OK 3 star, as it's not A-OK. While this place works in a pinch, there's better wings, deviled eggs, bbq, etc. in Charlotte. Skip it."}
{"text":"I debated about 3 stars and would have gone 3.5 if it was an option.  Macs is really close and I have eaten there plenty of times over the last few years.  Their sides are amazing but their bbq just isn't that good.  Their brisket plate comes with 3 pieces and you will get 1 that is melt in your mouth and another that is really tough.  I just can't give a bbq place more stars when their bbq isn't that good.  Side note, the smoke wings in vtx Chipotle are great and the fried catfish is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Barbecue can be a tricky endeavor, and I'm not easily won over. This place had great pulled pork, a real good sauce (most important) and felt like it was a comfortable atmosphere both times I was there. One time we sat inside, one time out.

Beware it can get crowded at the obvious times but on off-hours might be the best shot to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Consistent food and service. My go to spot. Their brisket served in anyway won't disappoint! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to visit NC and this place was at the top of our list. Amazing food & relatively priced  especially for us New Yorkers. Their smoked wings were my friends'a favorite. Mac and cheese, burgers and chicken sandwich were delicious! We went on a Friday night & their was a cool live band playing. Would definitely go back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"This was my introduction to Carolina style BBQ, and I was really impressed. I had the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. Service was painfully slow, but food was fab. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"I went here while visiting friends on vacation and had a fantastic time. The weather was perfect to sit outside and relax in an inviting atmosphere. The pulled pork was so delicious and melt in your mouth. Add the mac and cheese side and you have a classic southern comfort meal. I left satisfied but not uncomfortable. My husband had the Hop Drop and Roll beer and he said it was in his top ten for Imperial IPAs that he's ever had. He also loved his pulled pork sandwich and cheddar grits. I would absolutely recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I use to live close to Mac's and boy do I miss it. They have a good selection of beers which is a plus and the food has always been good. Although all I ever get is the pulled pork plate with onion rings and mac n cheese. My wife loves the Brunswick stew and my sister really like the burgers. I see a lot of complaints about the wait staff and even though I never had any problems that happens a lot when all you hire is moderately attractive young women. This place is always packed and I wish they had more parking but you can not blame them for people wanting to eat there."}
{"text":"Beware of this extremely racist place. If your not a local black person I guess  stay away.. This is my second & last time visit  this  F place... Food was dry had to send back ask for quarter chicken white instead they bring me out dark meet.. I told the waiters she just said ok.. Tip her $6 on $23 tap & got the heck out of there. Buyer be wear my stomach is upset I'm ready to go back down there & throw up in this place"}
{"text":"Hostess and server at high top table near outdoor bar were fantastic. Unfortunately, the food was not good. Beer can chicken dry as a bone and also flavorless. Mac and cheese was... lacking cheese?! Where is the cheese? Were you out of cheese today? Where is the flavor at all? It might as well have been buttered elbow macaroni made for a 2 year old. Come on, Mac's. Baked beans were cold. 

:( 

Go to Midwood Smokehouse if you want good BBQ."}
{"text":"I had Macs on Jan. 25th.  My family and I enjoyed various different plates that were served quickly by our server. The brisket was smokey and good, although I would slice it thin and pile it up for the same serving size. I would also not add the sauce to the brisket and allow diners to choose if they would want it or not.   The Mac and cheese and Brunswick stew are to die for.  My husband and I were a little put off by ordering beers on draft  that were out.  Since the beers are daily, it would be nice if they would strike off the ones that are out, prior to customers ordering.  That way we are not disappointed when we are told that what is listed as current is out. We will be back and give this another go."}
{"text":"Everyone at my work raves about this place and honestly I can't figure out what the big deal is. Maybe I'm snobbish or maybe my palate is just different from the testosterone I work with. This is just an okay BBQ place in my opinion. The Mac and cheese is decent, the pulled pork is decent, the brisket is pretty good actually, and the baked beans are blah. Oh and the banana pudding seems to be pretty processed, not terrible but not like your southern grandmother made either. All in all I wouldn't choose to come here on my own"}
{"text":"Love the food with live music and the staff knows there beer"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker visiting Charlotte for the first time, I was very much looking forward to getting some BBQ. We viewed the menu online and being only 5 minutes away from where we were staying, it seemed like a great idea. 

The wait was pretty long, about 30 minutes. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some beer in the meantime. They have a really large and great selection so the wait wasn't too brutal. 

When we finally sat down we were welcomed with some hush puppies, which on my first experience was pretty great :) though I have nothing to compare it to. 

Our appetizer was the burnt ends (brisket) and I couldn't be any happier. It was delicious! It was smiley and had just the right amount of heat. I could've easily eaten a whole plate of these to myself. 

The entrees we ordered was the ribs (me), pulled pork, and beer can chicken. I got to sample everything which was yummy, but boy oh boy was I in heaven with my 1/2 rack of ribs. Just thinking about it now makes my mouth water. You can't find BBQ like this back in NY. I'm very happy we visited this spot. We'll be back!! My mac n cheese was great, but the grits were pretty funny for my taste, though the flavor way pretty good. 

As far as the food is concerned I'll give it 5 stars. It loses one star for the delayed service. We showed up at 8:20 and we're out by 10:30, which was the only downside. The staff was kind however! Maybe I'll need to stop by at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Went there with my girl for valentines day. I loved all their food. They have best wings. I specially liked the wings with dry seasoning. Also liked their bbq. We ordered 2 bbq entree and wings, which lasted for another lunch and dinner after taking it home."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The food is outstanding, the beer selection is over the top, and the service is the best you will find.  We take all of our out of town guests here, and they fall in love just like we did. (now we have to take the sauce back to them when we visit them)"}
{"text":"Now let me start by saying...I love Mac's.   Love the sauce and love the food.  However, there is just something missing at this location, its just not as good as the South Blvd location.   The service is good, the beer selection is great, but the food always seems to be cold when it comes out.   I cant figure out why the difference."}
{"text":"I had wings, onion rings, nachos, and mac n cheese. It was all fantastic, except for the mac n cheese. That was just awful."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this establishment for all ages - 
Food is top shelf and service is higher. 
Management is on point !!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location and I really enjoyed the food. I was mad when I forgot my Togo box. The brisket and the ribs I had ordered were delicious. I am glad that before ordering my sides I asked for a sample of the potato salad, I didn't like it so for my sides I chose fries and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese wasn't all that, not very flavorful or creamy, but once I added salt and pepper it was edible. I recommended to my friends I was with to try the brisket and they both enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Ordered a half slab with fries and baked beans for my sides. The fries I enjoyed, they were very well seasoned (not salty). The ribs definitely have an intense smoke flavor to them. At first I wasn't too thrilled about the beans but when I reheated the next day they were more appealing to me. I also ordered a cup of chili and while they didn't add the jalapeños I wasn't too upset and did enjoy it. Very meaty, not sure what all was in it but I finished every bit of bit. I ordered a sweet tea but it wasn't very sweet, but hey, who comes here for the sweet tea. I want to come back for try more of their menu, but I was surprised my how small the sitting area is. They have lots of high pub style tables with the low level seating along the walls of the restaurant. If you're not a fan of pork I would suggest you ask what is in everything prior to ordering the beans, chili, collards.."}
{"text":"I will preface this by conceding that I am a 37 year old, old fart.  I like easy parking, no ridiculously loud music (unless it's the weekend and 10 pm, then there should be loud music) and comfortable seating choices.  If you fail on any of these requirements, I will not return.

Me and a group of friends were Thursday night regulars for after work drinks for a while until biker summer started with the live bands and blocking off most of the lot parking for motorcycles.  (It's an alleged biker bar, so I get that, they get the summer, no big, plenty of places around to drink).  We could generally slip out of work early and find a parking spot actually in the lot, which was nice. There is motorcycle parking, but there are always cars parked there instead - RUDE. The other parking alternative was a street on an adjacent lot, or parking across Sandy Porter at the shopping center and crossing over multiple lanes of traffic.  The side street is now a dirt pile of construction, which leaves your only option, if you can't find a spot in the lot, as the shopping center across the street.  

The service has never been bad, just inconsistent.  Some nights we would have a great waitress, other times we would be sitting with empty glasses, and it didn't seem to jive with how busy they were, just very hit and miss.  Again, no biggie, we're there to snack, drink and eat, no one was on a time schedule.  

The food has generally been decent.  The fried pickles are a little on the spicy side, but pretty good and served with ranch.  The hushpuppies with a little butter smeared on them are good.  Chili Nachos are standard bar nachos, nothing special but solid.  Being with a group of southern people generally, we had to try the Pimento cheese but found it to be not very good the night we ordered it and the tortilla chips were inedible from being over-salted.  I ordered the chopper salad once, that was a mistake. The collard greens are a little too spicy for my taste, but not bad.  The mac and cheese would be delicious on one visit and dry and meh the next.  Good choices of beer and beer specials.  On vodka nights, my drinks were always mixed well.

But this is a BBQ place, so as long as the BBQ is good, that is all that matters, RIGHT?!?!  And the BBQ is quite good.  I had the pulled pork which was very good and the Beef Brisket which was absolutely delicious.  The beef brisket is so good, it almost makes the ridiculous parking and the bar stools worth the hassle.  Almost.

Last Friday the girls wanted to go for dinner and drinks.  Being a Friday, I was ready to get out of work and get on with the weekend!  I received a text when I was on my way that the parking lot was already full (&%^$), but at least I can park on the street next to it.  I arrived only to see dirt everywhere and no street so I would have to park in the shopping center across Sandy Porter.  All of the relatively close spaces were taken (double-&%^$).  So now I get to play Frogger in an ankle length skirt and slip on shoes to get across the street to Mac's (triple-&%^$).  I managed to get across the street without getting squished or losing a shoe, increasingly agitated, but looking forward to some brisket, only to find that the rest of my party had perched their tiny hineys on wooden bar stools (there are chairs and wooden booths also, but the majority of the inside seating is high bar stools, with large picnic tables as the outdoor seating options).  (I am not a small chick and me on a wooden bar stool looks like a lumpy popsicle trying to eat it's stick).  I decided then and there that my only biker experience for the night would be Sons of Anarchy on Netflix and I hopped back across Sandy Porter and got out of there.  I should have gotten a to-go brisket, but was too annoyed to think of the goodness.  

They are doing something right because it seems to always be packed during peak hours, so if you are young enough to not mind parking issues and uncomfortable seating, head on over and get some yum BBQ."}
{"text":"I'm here regularly for lunch. Food and service is always good. There can be a bit of a wait especially as it gets warmer. Parking in the summer is horrible at peak hours and unfortunately they don't have the room to expand. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"For a BBQ/biker bar atmosphere, not a bad spot. The seating style suits the visiting crowd and beverage menu provides a little flair to the expected. 
I've been to this location and the one in Steele Creek. Both are consistent with their food offerings and casual environment. It's a large menu and if you're at a smaller table, it's difficult to have even a glass on the table top with it. One page, but very cumbersome. 
I've had the three meat platter with pulled pork, smoked turkey and ribs. Not bad, the turkey tends to be a bit dry. This visit I stuck with the small pulled pork platter with mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold by the time we got our food but it was a busy night. 
About what you expect for a casual bbq joint. Nothing special, but not a dive either."}
{"text":"For starters....since I'm n HD owner & rider, I immediately love this place! 
No...thats not why I gave it 5 as stingy as i am. 
Must not forget for all y'all beer drinkers...at least 100 IPAs & beer on tap and in BIG cans!
Wherever there is BBQ....I'm there! 
I got the 4 meat platter; pork, ribs, sausage, and brisket with collard greens, & beans. ALL EXCELLENT.....yes even the brisket! 
Look.....I'm not going line by line. Just know EVERYTHING I ordered came out fast, hot, and WAS EXCELLENT!
I hear rhe wings (from the locals) are exxellent as well, I just knew I wantwd the playter and wouls not be able to eat wings too.
Oh...yeah and there is 80's rock playimg ALL RHE TIME...Y. E. A. H. !!!"}
{"text":"Crowded when we went, but that's expected due to the fact it's new and in the restaurant dead space of Matthews.  Service was as fast as could be expected and BBQ as good as Mac's always is.  The biggest issue with this location is parking. No clue how this place was approved by Zoning as there are few parking spaces here.  Be prepared to be frustrated when parking."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in North Carolina. Beats all other BBQ food that I have had in the South. Usually prompt service as well! If you haven't had it go get it!"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ joint in town. Can't beat the menu, the beer, nor the atmosphere. Go to."}
{"text":"No complaints here, the food was phenomenal! Wish we had these back in FL. I ordered with a group and we had the collard greens, grits, and cream corn (which is actually spicy), pulled turkey, whole chicken, and the best was that brisket. Everything was very fresh and tasted homemade."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 6-March-2017
Time of my visit: late night

I arrived at Charlotte very late and did not have a chance to have dinner.  So I wanted something quick, reasonably close to my hotel and something I'd like.  So I figured I could not go wrong with the wings.  This joint came up and it was opened until midnight.

I arrived to no hostess and a sign to seat myself.  So I found a spot.  The place was almost empty, it had two more patrons at the bar and some (as I found out later) outside.  The waitress came over right away, asking what I wanted to drink.  Unfortunately, they were out of tea, so I took water and ordered 16 drumstick only wings: 8 honey BBQ and 8 (I wanna say VS BBQ sauce).

It did not take long for the food to come out.  Unfortunately, the wings were mixed...  The waitress claimed she did not even notice, but immediately offered to remake them.  I get it, you, guys, were closing soon and probably wanted to get out, but come on!  I was not gonna make you re-do them.

The wings were cooked on a grill (not fried), which I thought was awesome and it had that nice open flame/grill taste to them, but as chicken go, some parts were burned.  Both sauces went well with the wings.

Overall a C experience."}
{"text":"Hush puppies are a great start. I have never got anything here I didnt like, but small bbq sandwich and side carr are my regulars. Good service and great feel when you visit. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm didn't realize i have no reviews for Mac's.  One of the best bbq places in south end area.  My most favorite is the beer can chicken that is slow smoked and finished on grill.  Wife and I love the taste, we order it every time we like to eat some smoked chicken for dinner.  Their chili is awesome, with some tortilla chips you can go bottomless with the chili. Great ambiance and lovely outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night and were seated outside immediately. After about 10 minutes a server walked up to us and asked for drinks and appetizers. So we got drinks and onion rings, which came out very fast. They were average tasting, but nothing special. We decided to leave because the prices were high and the service was slow. Even a manager (man with black Macs shirt) passed us many times while we were waiting for a server."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. My wife and I drive in from Columbia on a frequent basis and often stop here.

Weather permitting I sit outside and enjoy a beer from a local microbrewery and order the\"Little of Everything\" plate...which is actually A LOT of food! :-)

The service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"I was visiting town for a girlfriend getaway weekend and started our weekend here with BBQ dinner. I loved the atmosphere and outdoor seating (great for groups)! I went with the brisket (and side of mac'n'cheese) which was delicious! This was my first Carolina BBQ experience (coming from TX background), so I cannot compare it to other local places. I thoroughly enjoyed it here! Service was also on point!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Carolina's but I know alllllllll about the BBQ rivalry. I haven't been to an amazing BBQ place since I've been here (just a couple of chain places) but I had been told by my coworkers that Mac's is supposedly one of Charlotte's best. Yesterday, I gave it a try.

First of all, the place has great ambiance. Biker Bar themed BBQ joint that is immaculately clean, and is bigger than I expected it to be. There is a cute patio too that seems like a fun place to have some Friday night cocktails in the summer. 

The service was on point. I was there for lunch on a weekday and I could see that it gets busy around that time. Our server was nice and was at our table just enough, not too much. The food also came out really fast so that was great.

Now, the food. First, you get a plate of hush puppies. Not my favorite, but they were pretty good.  I ordered the small smoked turkey plate with collard greens and mac n' cheese. Maybe it's cause I'm new but the greens were to die for! You can't get greens like that in my home state and they were so tasty. A tiny bit spicy with lots of flavor. The mac n cheese was great too. The smoked turkey was alright. Maybe I just like pulled pork better but it still good. Also, it doesn't have much sauce on it which I was happy about because I like trying the different sauces on mine.

I'd definitely come back to Macs. The cocktails look delicious (Cucumber bloody mary? Um, YES) and I think next time I'd get the pulled pork sandwich too."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place that seems to have a wanna be biker bar feel... It all seems a little put on and chain restaurant-ish. There is a patio that is quite large, unfortunately there is no real scenery to enjoy while sitting on the patio, but it is still quite enjoyable. 

The beer list is packed with terrific brews. Both on tap and in bottles. The tap list could stand to be a little more extensive, but what is on it is fairly impressive. The menu is about what you would expect from a BBQ joint. The pulled pork and the brisket were quite good. Slightly expensive, but very good.

Very good place to go for a few beers, but there is definately room for improvement"}
{"text":"So, as a through-and-through SoCal gal, I can tell you that barbecue in California is not the same as NC. I was visiting family for the week and we absolutely had to try the southern bbq cuisine that was so easily within our grasp. 

Their Pulled Pork BBQ from the platters section was moist and delicious! They're also not kidding about lightly tossed with their bbq sauce. The meat slightly seasoned, enough to the point where you can eat it super happily without any additional sauce, but light enough so that other sauces at the table could be used. 

My two \"side cars\" included mac & cheese and regular french fries. The fries were so good, and a great salty, sharp contrast to the barbecued meat. Mac & cheese tasted like they were deliciously homemade! The creamy cheese flavor had a perfect salt balance. Sweet potato fries, while good, were a little on the soggy side. 

The St. Louis Rib from the Combo Platter was (!)#$*#_ delicious!!!! The meat fell right off bone and then apart in your mouth. It was perfectly coated with Red BBQ sauce, and had a deep smokey taste. 

I'd definitely recommend the St. Louis Ribs with the mac & cheese side car. With those two options, you can't go wrong. Forget the sweet potato fries as it's nothing special (though I think they charge an extra $1). It's a place that I'd go back to if I ever visited the area again! 

Service was on point - fast and polite, though I did get a good chuckle out of some of the startled stares because of my Asian face. Ha...ha... Mac's has a great sports bar atmosphere, but I felt a little confused with the sports bar, plus bbq, plus...racing/motorcycling(??) theme. In any case, it seems like a great place to be to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend is in the military and they give 50 percent off for military (with your id of course). Everything we have ever ordered here has been excellent. Their bbq is sweet and savory and so is the beef brisket. The rotisserie (beer can) chicken will melt in your mouth. I love their green bean casserole as well. Can't wait to go back. Now I'm getting hungry, yum."}
{"text":"Best barbecue around. Great service. Their side cars are all delicious. The Brunswick stew is just like mom use to make. They have lots of seating inside and out. Great place to come and watch football"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while driving around searching for somewhere to eat without being very familiar with the area and it was a pleasant surprise! The weather was gorgeous so we sat outside at the bar and the bar tender had a wonderful friendly personality quickly whipped up our drinks and made sure to point out personal favorites of hers to help us narrow down our options. Food was pretty good, atmosphere was excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We orders fried pickles and burnt ends as appetizers. The burnt ends were out of this world melt in your mouth fantastic.  Pickles were good too, advertised as Tabasco pickles but didn't have too much bite. Hen we split a brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese had tasty crusty pieces and the brisket was very tender.  Service was great, very quick.  This place is vastly superior to midwood smokehouse."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and I had the brisket Philly wrap.  I have had his at the Southend and the Steele Creek locations.  The wrap was stuffed with meat, absolutely stuffed. I was excited until I bit into it and the brisket was all very small dried hard pieces that were probably left over from the weekend's BBQ.  I almost choked a couple of times trying to eat it.  I kept searching for any moisture in the wrap, I unwrapped it and BBQ sauce didn't help. There was very little cheese or pepper/onions.  Not fresh.  Not what I had had before.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of coworkers while traveling from other parts of the continent. The restaurant is large, with a relaxed bar feel to it, that is well decorated. Our server was fantastic. But the real star was the food. Oh my, the food. We tried all the meats on the combos and half the appetizers. The real stars were the sausage, ribs, and wings.  None of it was bad, but those made me the happiest."}
{"text":"Forget poor service, how about NO SERVICE.

It was a Friday night back in January and a friend and I happened to be in the area and found that there was a Mac's Speed Shop location in Steele Creek. We decided to go there based off the reputation of the one located on South Blvd.  Little did I know that I was in for the poorest customer experience I've ever had in a restaurant.

We get there around 9:30 PM and the hostess quickly seats us.  After about 15 minutes of sitting no server has come to our table yet so we grab one of the many servers walking around and ask for a server.  She told us that our server was busy in the back cleaning and would be out soon but in the meantime she would take our orders for drinks.  We ordered a couple of waters and Long Island Iced Teas.  She did bring the waters out quickly.  About 20-25 more minutes pass and no drinks, and no server returns to actually take our orders for food.  So at this point we've been here for a good 40+ minutes with no server.  I look around and notice that many of the girls working there were just standing around doing nothing.  Some of them even had the audacity to look towards our table but not have the initiative to provide any service or do their job.  Not sure who manages this place but it was very poorly run that night.  Some of the other patrons were actually being served too so I'm not certain if there's some familiarity thing going on or whether the staff was just outright lazy.  Whatever the case, we decided to just get up and leave rather than create a scene.  Whoever was in charge of the staff here certainly needs to either clean house on the poor staff or change his/her own management style.  I've never had such an awkward and terrible experience in a restaurant before.  It goes without saying that we won't be back and won't recommend this location to anyone else.  It's sad because based on the South Blvd location, I can say that Mac's actually does have good food.

If you want to try Mac's Speed Shop then head to the South Blvd location.  Don't waste your time in this one with the absolutely clueless staff and their total lack of professionalism.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Love their sauces.  Great service, a wide variety of draft beers and sports.  Not much more to ask.  Oh yeah, the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I frequent Mac's but today, I ordered something I have never ordered here.  I got the pulled chicken sandwich and oh my GOODNESS...hands down, best sandwich I've had in quite some time!"}
{"text":"Really, really disappointed.  I have eaten at the Steele Creek location many times and have had good meals.  We took my husband to the one in Cornelius for his birthday this week, and it was terrible.  The pulled pork was DRY---so dry that it had to be doused in sauce to make it tolerable.  The fries were cold.  The cole slaw had no sauce or seasoning; tasted like plain, shredded cabbage.  The mac cheese was also cold.  Really disheartening to take a family out for dinner and spend $60+ and the food is terrible.  So bad you wished you'd stayed home and eaten leftovers.  We won't be going back.  Waitress was terrible too, by the way.  She was too busy talking with friends and going out to smoke to even come back and bring our bill.  Food took forever, bill took forever, and experience was awful.  Make the trip to Jim N Nick's and don't waste your time at Mac's."}
{"text":"The addition of Mac's Speed Shop is the latest in the puzzling trend of biker hangouts trying to establish a foothold in the lake community.

However, this one seems to be gaining a foothold, largely because Mac's is a good time!

As for the food, I can't seem to get away from the Hand-pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich, which is excellent and nearly requires two people to eat. My friends have told me the BBQ plates and ribs are also good.

It is a laid-back, yet energetic place with great barbecue. An excellent place to swing by for lunch, if you don't mind fighting the lunch crowds.

You can expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $20, depending on how much beer you drink before heading back to the office!

When the sun goes down is when Mac's pulls on its biker gear and gets down to business. I rolled by there most recently on a Thursday night, and it was like the Hell's Angels had come to town. There were bikes everywhere, the front patio was filled with people, and a band was setting up. Looked like a party to me!

Mac's has turned out to be a refreshing, different kind of nightspot from some of the  other \"look-at-me\" options around the lake.
It's good to have variety!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a good atmosphere.  The bar has a good selection of beers and the service was excellent.  I had the wings. They were delicious.  The way that they cook the wings, they just fall off the bone.  Every time I am in town I try to stop at this place."}
{"text":"I just came back from a week in Texas where I indulged in lots of \"Texas\" style BBQ. It was good however I missed my NC BBQ with that smoked goodness, burnt ends and good or should I say Mac and cheese made the right way. So on my first full day back I had to bee line it to Mac's for my fix"}
{"text":"When I have friends or family in from out of town, we always take a trip to Mac's!  The atmosphere is a biker/hipster/family hangout...I'm not even sure how that's exactly possible, but Mac's achieves it with brilliance.  The servers are almost always tatted-up and always super-attentive.  

When the weather is nice, you can sit outside on their patio and enjoy fresh air along with bbq and beer.  When it's cooler, half of the outdoor patio can be closed in and they'll pack you in to the interior.  

The food - you can't go wrong here.  If you're extra-hungry or sharing with someone, grab the \"little bit of everything\" - you get a selection of smoked meats and sides.  I also really like their quesadillas and chopped salad.  For an appetizer, grab the fried pickles - you won't be disappointed.  Their banana pudding will convert even non-pudding fans into fanatics!"}
{"text":"I imagine Mac's is a great spot for a few beers and the game with some buddies, but unfortunately I was only in for lunch with colleagues, so I didn't get the chance to loosen my tie.

In short; a good pulled pork sandwich, delicious hush puppies, and a plethora of craft beers on tap.  Given the opportunity, I'd make my way back."}
{"text":"More Texas Style Q than Carolina

Don't get me wrong. I like Texas Style BBQ or for that matter, I basically like anything that is BBQ's.  Some I like more than others and sometimes it comes down to the sauce.  I have never quite warmed up to the Mustard Based SC style sauce.

Anyway, the prime offerings center around Beef Brisket which is excellent.  For those of us who are Carolinian's, they do have some great Pork offerings that are excellent.  All are smoke properly and you can see the smoke ring on many pieces.  

Great meat.  For an appetizer, I recommend at least a cup if not a bowl of their Chili/. I've had that many times and only once have a had a cup of Chili that was not up to parr.  My wife normally sticks to the Mac and Cheese and it's so good, she will make a special trip to get it.

The atmosphere?  Cross between an upscale biker bar and Texas Roadhouse.  Both work well.  Lot of very expensive Harley's parked outside but maintains a Texas Hill Country Bar Atmosphere

Service is very good and I have never had bad service, no matter how congested the restaurant was.

Strongly recommedn"}
{"text":"We've been fans of Mac's for some time, but didn't go all that often because it was too far to roam.  Then, we figured out that there was a location nearer... this one!
And so, I've been more than once recently.
We had some food catered (pork barbecue and Mac 'n Cheese) for a summer party.  Catering was easy to use, food was prepared perfectly and on time.  This is simply one of the best solutions when you are expecting company and don't want to cook yourself!
If you haven't been to Mac's,  you just need to go!  So many good choices on the menu!!  Of course they are known for the barbecue.  Their pork barbecue is hard to beat!  But then, try a sampler...  You won't be disappointed in ANY of the meats at Mac's.  The brisket, the ribs, the sausages, AND the chicken... all are really good! 
Several good starters... I like the fried pickles w/ ranch!
 If you don't choose the Mac 'n Cheese as one of your sides... that's okay (more for me!), but you should. It's NOT diet food, but hey, you can WALK home if you need to make up for the extra calories!  I also like the baked beans and the collard greens.  Not so crazy about their green bean casserole... but others seem to be!  My friend (from SC) ordered the Brunswick Stew and said it was really good (and a little spicy too!)!  I'll try that myself soon... I'm sure!
Beverages... of course they have whatever you might want, but for me... they have COPPER!!  Beer brewed by The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery, right here in Charlotte.  There is just nothing better (for me) with this barbecue!!
So, this week, I ordered dessert. I never had before, because I was too darned full!  But the friend I was with wanted something, so I followed along.  Let me tell you... the Banana Pudding was simply some of the best I've ever encountered.  Now I have a real problem - how to go back and NOT order it!  If you find yourself stuffed, order it anyway and take it home to eat later.
The only downside for this place is that parking can get a little short!  But that, in itself, tells you how good it is, right?
I'm sure that I'll see you there... shortly!!"}
{"text":"Nice location in Mathews. Long list of craft and local beers. Great service but the portions are small. They load up the thick bread slices or buns, so you don't notice that there isn't much meat. Maybe we ordered the wrong items. We'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town.  Kansas city beef ribs, hush puppies, and beer. Cleaned up bikers bar with great food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"i have been there 3 times every was great!! please note: when getting the $5 tacos you only get one.  the black bean quesadilla is good. our service the last time was great!!  the hush puppies you will get at your table. please note: the butter that comes with the hush puppies taste like some whipped ice cream!!! its sooooooooo good!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the atmosphere but has a heavy biker hipster bar feel.

The BBQ was great but not fall off your chair awesome. Brisket was perfect but under seasoned . Ribs needed a little more time to fall off the bone but was above average for sue.

The multiple sauces were an A+! You'll find one that matches your taste. The beans were good, mac and cheese not so much. Lots of mac, not so much on the cheesy side. 

The server was awesome. Really made the experience! Didn't catch her name.

They have about 50 different beers on tap! Very awesome in that.

Definitely would come back but this isn't a pit masters' BBQ joint. 

A generous four stars because if the server. Hire more like her."}
{"text":"Let me first say, I've been a huge fan of Mac's on South Blvd since 2007 when I lived in 4th Ward. I've seen them change over the years (still miss my $3 24oz Bud Light) but I've always thought they've maintained a high level for the quality of the food. Now that I live further in South Charlotte, I was super excited to see them opening a location in Matthews.

I'm at a pretty big loss on some of these negative reviews. I feel like this location captures pretty much the same spirit (in terms of seating, food, noise level) as the South Blvd original. I thought the food was excellent, and the beer selection is as stellar per usual. I usually get the same thing every time, since I enjoy it and fallen into the trap of \"well this other stuff looks good, but man, I KNOW this is good\". But I'd rank what I get, the pulled pork with 2 sides, against any other BBQ place in town (such as Midwood or Improper Pig).

Is Mac's loud inside? Yeah sure, it's a bbq place with a large bar and lots of TVs. I'm not sure who complained about bad prices, but it's comparable to everywhere I've ever been for a plate of pulled pork+sides (about $10, or a sandwich and a side is like $7). I had great service at the Matthews location, very attentive and nice. I mean, I guess they have some high stools, but that's seems like a weird thing to complain about. I'd rather judge a bbq place on the food/atmosphere/beer selection. All of which I find to be great. 

I enjoy Mac's and I'm glad they're close by in Matthews now."}
{"text":"I was on the fence about this place after I read most of the reviews. My husband said he wanted barbecue and I had actually picked a different restaurant based on these reviews. He talked me into it and that was a huge mistake. I got a burger because I hate barbecue... The burger in the middle was cold and not cooked at all. The outside of the burger was burned and it was also greasy. I definitely will not be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining at Mac's but our first time at this location.
We were greeted by the most sour faced hostess who barely made eye contact. She brought us over to a round table with stools and because of a shoulder issue, I asked to be moved to a table.  She rolled her eyes and huffed but moved us to a corner table.
Our server came over immediately and was extremely pleasant, offering us drinks and appetizers. We ordered a soda, margarita (featured drink) and deviled eggs. Our drinks came out quick, along with our eggs (the eggs were good but I didn't care for the hint of horseradish but tha personal taste) the Margarita was delivered once we were done with the eggs and it was OK. 
We finally ordered our entrées.  My husband got the Philly Brisket Wrap with red beans and rice (it was delicious!) And I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a side of mac and cheese (excellent!)
Our server was cheery and offered us to go drinks. She was always pleasant and very high energy (she needs to wear off the stone faced hostess). 
We were quickly given our check and we left. The hostess who barely made eye contact as we said good bye mumbled some thing to us.  I stopped and said to her she should smile more. She grunted at me in response. Maybe she shouldn't be the face of the store.
Our experience was a good one - the hostess needs to be replaced"}
{"text":"We have been to several other locations of Mac's, but while shopping today at the Outlet Mall we wanted some lunch and I found this location on YELP!
Another great experience with Mac's staff and food service.  I was happy to find out I could order side dishes as a meal and got the chili, a side salad, and mac n cheese.  Perfect size meal for me and so so good.
We caught some of the Panthers football game, had a great lunch, and will continue to dine at our local Mac's."}
{"text":"When you're from out of town and you ask a local where to eat, they'll say Mac's Speed Shop. 'Nuff said. The doors are open. Grab any seat you can find. And, make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach. 

Don't know what to get, order 'A whole lot of stuff\". It's basically everything. Tons of beers and some wine for you non-gender assigned friend. It's North Carolina so choose the right bathroom."}
{"text":"I didn't go in but I picked up a to-go order around 12 am possibly. When I tell you this is the best late night food that I have had in awhile I mean it! The seasoning on the fish was amazing. I have never had a green bean casserole that good! The Mac and cheese...was cheesy, not over cooked. Whoever was in the kitchen put their soul in this food! Everything down to the sauce was good!  Will be coming back definitely! Thank you."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese is delicious! I had the brisket sandwich and the flavor was smokey and tender. The Texas toast was a nice addition along with any flavor of BBQ sauce from the table. Try the tater tots if you get a chance, they are Extra crispy."}
{"text":"Longtime fan of the original location, thought I should try this one.  I had the brisket sandwich with a side of cheese grits for lunch. Brisket was awesome!  This location has plenty of room and a nice patio and and open air section. Service was fast, hush puppies were fantastic. Shout out to my server Erica, she looked after me and made sure I was happy."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location attracts a somewhat rough crowd of bikers that like to slash your tires. So if you like your car, you might want to consider a different option."}
{"text":"Mac's is a great place to eat if you want heavy comfort food surrounded by bikers and live music. I've been here multiple times and their food really is good, but has a tendency to just sit in your tummy. Hubs and I always feel a little sick after eating here. But, their BBQ and mac n cheese is really tasty. 

There's plenty of parking and indoor and outdoor seating with a pet friendly patio. They have live music outside often which is good and bad. I love the music and support local musicians, but it's usually too loud to have a conversation over and definitely too loud for dogs' ears. Our service has been hit or miss, sometimes awesome, sometimes neglected. And when there's a group of bikers around, be prepared for a wait and loud engines!

Mac's is a place where I'll go if invited by friends, but I wouldn't choose on my own. I also know a waitress that works here and they treat their employees pretty well, so I salute that. Check it out if you're in the mood for BBQ and form your own opinion!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Seems like a pretty cool little joint.  However, my food wasn't very good.  My BBQ was dry and my mac-n-cheese was old and bland.  I wouldn't recommend this place for food.  Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"Love the fun atmosphere and friendly staff.  I sort of agree with another reviewer about being called the pet names, but everyone has their preference.  I always appreciate the frequent check-ins by the the server, but ours overdid it when we were there around December 14th.  That was no big either, and the best reason for going there is the food, which was fantastic.  They have lots of variety and everything is super yummy.  Will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the service was bad. Our waitress was rude and not personable at all. She barely checked to see if we needed anything and when we did ask her for something she acted like we were bothering her. We also ordered a beer and a shot at one point and it took 15 minutes to get it. Ladies please pre bus..nobody wants to sit at a table full of empty glasses and dirty plates. Honestly im not very likely to come back and although I have heard good things I'm a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I was craving pulled pork, just happen to stop in here. Sat at the bar for lunch -- VERY quick service (food was out in 5 minutes)! Great bartender/server. Very glad I came here. Would recommend. #winninglunch"}
{"text":"Food isn't as good as the Southend location and the service is terrible 2 out the 6 times I've been. Good beer selection though"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this Mac's existed before someone told me to meet them there and after heading in the wrong direction informed me \"not the one on South.\" 
Once i arrived after they'd been waiting several minutes, no server had been around. Sat for a few more minutes before we got some service. 

As far as food, pretty much the same Macs you'd expect, although my lil pig pork sandwich didn't seem all that warm when it was served. 

i misread one of the chalkboards thinking there was a draft special of some sort, but much to my surprise the draft beer i ordered cost nearly as much as my sandwich. Honestly, as much as i love beer, and i am a borderline alcoholic, i would never pay that much for a single beer. $7.50 for a beer? i did enjoy the beer, but that's besides the point. No beer is worth that much to me on a Tuesday night when i could get plenty of good beer at Duckworth's for $2.50. 
i guess i'll just have to check the price for my beer-budget conscious self next time before ordering. 

If nothing else, it's nice to know this Mac's exist."}
{"text":"Bad food. Bad service. Bad prices. Bad everything. Most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in- I literally saw a girl fall off these high stools. $7 beer, $5 taco and $5 chips."}
{"text":"Great place to go for dinner. I went here with a friend for dinner before a comedy show. The pulled pork was delicious. Service was great. Prices are good as well. Its nice to not have to go into the Uptown area for a delious BBQ meal."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are my favorite. Every dish is sooo good in general. So many beer options and the beer is always so cold and refreshing. Always great place to bring family from out of town."}
{"text":"We come to Mac's at least once a week and always come away satisfied. You can't go wrong with the pulled pork or the beer can chicken with collard greens and baked beans. The chicken tacos are really good as well.  There few places in Charlotte with more beer options. 

The atmosphere is loud and chaotic so be prepared. If the parking lot is full (as it usually is), then park on the side road in front of the building.  The wait is never very long and it's worth it.  This is a great place to watch a game.

(If you're a native Carolinian as I am, you may be disappointed in the Brunswick stew.)"}
{"text":"The advertising is point on - it is a beer bar with a \"biker\" atmosphere. Knowing good BBQ, I am hesitant to try BBQ from most joints. That being the case, I had them add pulled pork BBQ to the plain hamburger. It was amazing, and I am glad I asked for the additional pork on my burger."}
{"text":"100% Disappointing. I have been here before and every time it just keeps getting a little bit worse. I think I am done now with Mac's. First it's a huge waste of money. Everything is overpriced and now not worth it. It's too dark inside to read the menu and the design of the menu does not make well for the lighting. This is the first clue no one is paying attention to the details. The Fired Pickles were greasy and that meant they fell apart. For 1 order of pickles they give you a small side of ranch dressing. Should come with more. My BBQ Sam'ich looked like they had dipped it in the deep fat fryier before it came out. It was covered in grease. The theme now seems to be everything with a side of grease. I get it, it's not health food but BBQ should have some fat on it but not tons of grease. It was not edible. The sweet tea was good but that was about it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with an old work friend on Tuesday night.  Was surprisingly packed for 18:30 on a Tuesday, but we got a table within five minutes (finding parking was much more difficult).  I tried the Philly brisket wrap with mac'n cheese and my buddy tried the Carolina pulled pork.  The Philly wrap was good with lots of cheese.  Also got the $3 \"mystery beer\" which was an interesting concept.  For $3, they pull off a random bottle beer.  Was happy with the result, so that was good.  Liked the food, good environment, just not the best BBQ I've ever had.  Good for Charlotte though!"}
{"text":"Lancaster BBQ is better, much better without the roadhouse wannabe feel.  Sometimes I just don't feel like listening to Staind at ear pearcing levels while I'm trying to nom...sue me."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Charlotte area and not many places to chose from where I am staying, so I decided to venture out. I was pleasantly surprised to find Mac's. The prices are a great value for the amount of food you get, plus the service was fast in my experience. When I sat down at the bar the bartender, Scott, instantly introduced himself to me and remembered my name throughout my stay. I have to say I was extremely impressed by everything all around!!"}
{"text":"First time here at this location. Ordered a beer and didn't like it at all. My server Lindsay talked to her manager and they exchanged it no questions asked. Service was excellent. Lindsay is so good at her job. Thanks again guys. Request her....you'll have great service."}
{"text":"Nice bbq option. Tried the small Try It platter. Waaaaay too much food. Tx beef sausage w Carolina bbq sauce and onion rings. Nice."}
{"text":"Great flavors , just the right Smokey flavor . Green bean casserole was wonderful too. The atmosphere casual and relaxed, staff very friendly and I like that they work as a team to make your meal a pleasant experience. At least 50 beers on tap , plus mixed drinks .."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!   We had a small issue but management made it right and we couldn't be happier.   We highly recommend this place.  We got the double platter so tried everything and loved everything.   Our waitress Rachel was amazing.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"As far as Charlotte barbeque is concerned, I compare everything to Midwood Smokehouse. Mac's is not that. 

I'm pretty easy to please so I went with the basic Hickory smoked pulled pork plate with mac'n'cheese and green bean casserole as the sides. Nothing really caught my attention. The barbeque was ok, the barbeque sauce was meh. The GB casserole may or may not have come out of a couple of cans. I will say that the mac'n'cheese was pretty darn good though. Not a huge portion, but very creamy and cheesy.

Outside of the food, I came in with a group of seven. Instead of putting a few regular tables together for our group, they jammed together three round high-top tables! Everyone was crammed in like sardines, and one guy almost didn't have anywhere to put his plate due to the gap between two tables. Quite ridiculous.

I know some people swear by Mac's. I am definitely down to have another go, and I definitely hope the outcome is more satisfactory."}
{"text":"Oh man. First experience at the Mac's in Cornelius (used to live close to the one in South End), and it was an interesting one.

To get the food situation out of the way, it was delicious as usual, but seemed like it had been sitting out for a while as it was not very hot, and was barely warm. I don't mind cold bbq (gives me that leftovers feel I guess), but cold mac 'n' cheese and green bean casserole is not a good look. 

I'm guessing that the food was cold because it took me FOUR ATTEMPTS to order a beer. The drink menu that they have looks extensive, but they must not update it regularly. I ordered one, waitress came back saying the keg had \"just kicked\". Ordered a second, waitress comes back, \"Oh we're out\". Ordered a third, waitress comes back and essentially tells me what they have and to choose from those. She was very kind throughout the ordeal and did not charge me for the beer, but it was from an inconvenience, to mildly funny, to rather annoying quite quickly. 

Like I said, I love Mac's and I'm sure this was a one-off experience, but it certainly doesn't lend me to wanting to go back even though I know I will."}
{"text":"I frequent Macs a lot and I just can't get enough of their brisket. Its is absolutely the best item they do here. Beers are good and oh yes the Mac and Cheese is extremely great. You can go wrong with Macs!"}
{"text":"How in this world can anyone give this place a review of less than five stars?  From the extensive selection of BEER on tap(or bottles and cans) to the amazing offerings of beef, chicken and pork BBQ, Mac's has it all. Granted the staff is stretched very thin at times but they are always friendly and attentive. The bar staff is amazing and they never miss a beat even to the point that they make first time guest feel like they own the stool they are sitting on. Did I mention the beer? I hope they are on TapHunter, I'll leave a review there too!  I look forward to going back to Matthews now, more than ever!"}
{"text":"If you this restaurant hasn't already caught your attention when you drive along South Blvd, you probably need to fix appointment with your optometrist! Mac's Speed Shop is a themed bar/restaurant and the signs, lights and a themed parkway all call for attention. The atmosphere is also lively and energetic with a more unconventional seating, the tables got bar stools rather than chairs or booths. There also a dozen TVs around giving you enough chances to catch up on the latest ball game. Our waitress was friendly and pretty quick to serve us. Trust me, even when the restaurant appeared crowded we had no wait time to get a table or to get served. 

The menu combines the regular American starters - wings are a big part of the menu. Interestingly, the menu also features Mexican Quesadillas, Tacos and Salads options - Might come in handy for that calorie conscious friend. The impressive part of the menu are the BBQ and burger options. The 10z burgers are HUGE and delicious! The only reason I hand to go with 4 stars was because the side of Onion Rings were pathetic and wouldn't expect any mediocre restaurant to serve those!

It's a must try restaurant if you are in Charlotte. Go in for hot crispy Hush Puppies, lovely atmosphere and quick service. Did I also mention that the bill doesn't burn a hole in your wallet!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on12/29/13. Anxious to try the baby back ribs.  Ordered the onion rings basket as an accompany side an WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.   The Ribs,  had a deep smoked flavor,  much like mines should I have taken the better part of the day to smoke them in the bug green egg.   The onion rings were old school style, large, hot and succulent.  And to think,  all this finger lickin sauce on these ribs were this close to me and I just figured it out....."}
{"text":"Great place.Good food, great beer selection.Amanda was amazing.Prompt, courteous, knowledgeable and engaging.Im sold.WILL BE A REGULAR."}
{"text":"Mac's Speed Shop in the Steele Creek area is not only some of the greatest barbecue and fried pickles there is to offer in the area, but the atmosphere is fantastic. The outside porch rocks some great bands and music during the summer time, allowing guests to sit outside in the beautiful weather enjoy some great food and hear some great Tunes. The prices are very reasonable, the location is easy to get to, and the food is always dependable and great. There's also a great selection of drinks and beers to choose from. I highly recommend Mac's Speed Shop, Steele Creek"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday with some buddies to watch football. Ordered the St. Louis ribs with collard greens and potato salad. Ribs were ok, a little on the dry side though. This can be compensated by drenching the ribs in their three signature bbq sauces (mustard, red bbq sauce, and vinegar). The sides were on point though. Good atmosphere with plenty of NFL games on the many flat screen tv's. Will definitely be back on another Sunday to catch my Falcons game..."}
{"text":"In town for business. The service was fast and attentive. The portions are large. Had he burnt ends which were great. Pulled pork was very good as well. Tuesday is apparently $3 mystery can beer night which was a bonus. Will definitely put his on my list of stops when back in town."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff. The burnt ends were a fantastic appetizer and the also provide complimentary hush puppies. Pulled pork was fantastic and the Brunswick Stew was made just the way I like it. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just finished a quick delicious lunch at Mac's. I ordered the pulled pork with a side of mac & cheese & it was everything I thought it was going to be. As an appetizer we got the fried pickles & the honey BBQ wings. Great food, and fast & friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Go to any location and you will not be disappointed. Great beer selection, wonderful staff and terrific food. Try the burnt ends appetizer and the smoked wings ....... but it's all good."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5- never been disappointed!

Venue: 4/5- if you get cold easily, DEFINITELY bring a jacket with you. There isn't a ton of seating and it's loud but it's a rad place to watch sports and eat. 

Atmosphere/Service: 4/5- Eh, I don't remember any noticeably great service or bad service except once we had a waitress that was just rude. Overrall, it's all your standard, average burger/biker joint."}
{"text":"I can't give this place a 5 because of the sides. Each time I've been here I've had great service, the ribs have been phenomenal, but every time I am disappointed by the sides. 

The Mac and cheese is not worth wasting the calories on and the green bean casserole is nothing to be impressed with either. Fries and onion rings mediocre.  

Overall great main dish, good service, and good prices."}
{"text":"What can I say about Macs Speed Shop! This is not only a bikers bar. They have a large selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"The real OG. The barbecue here is so so so good. Must add all the sauces and put coleslaw on top. The service is great, the food comes out really fast, and the bartenders are awesome. Nothing beats a warm afternoon on their patio!"}
{"text":"The bbq is super yummy but this one will never beat the south end location. This one feels more like just a little barbecue restaurant on the side of the road, Macs in south end feels like an actual bike and barbecue beer joint. The service is much better at south end, and the food comes out really fast. Every time I've been to this location the food takes forever"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a flag football tournament. It was a great choice because they are pet friendly considering our group had 3 dogs. Service was good, prompt, attentive to our needs but not overly in our faces. I ordered the pulled pork with a side of cole slaw and mac-n-cheese. The cole slaw was missing something, vinegar or mayo, as it was on the dry side, but still tasty. I loved the mac-n-cheese and pulled pork. I prefer the mustard BBQ sauce. Also ordered the banana pudding for dessert, I'd have to give it 2 stars because it wasn't as fresh. Bananas had turned and it was very runny. Overall I'd go back and recommend Mac's."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good & service is as well. 
The only thing is how loud it gets inside. Even when it's not busy it's hard to hear the people talking & the servers. I'm not old and do not have hearing problems this place is just really loud. Don't go with someone that does have a hearing problem though - you'll be yelling the whole time."}
{"text":"Oh Mac's only a mile and a half down the road and I have just visited you.... shame on me!
Today was my first time here and I will definitely come back for more. Our server was super friendly, and gave good recommendations. The place was much bigger than I expected with a full bar and seating inside and outside. Today's special was a chimichanga which was amazing. It was smothered in cheesy goodness. I have no idea why it's not on the menu all the time. I ate it in typical Sam fashion queso in hair while making mmm noises. I have never been so pleased by BBQ before in my life. I'm still drooling post meal and I am not ashamed. I'm super excited to go back and see what else I can try on the menu!
Happy eating Yelpers!
Sorry for the lack of a photo, I saw it and then needed it in my belly ASAP"}
{"text":"I sat out in 95 degree weather for their barbecue once.  And it was glorious.

Don't think that the small plate isn't enough to fill you up -- it's a good size, and the reason I'd pay the $2 extra for their large plate is because the food is so damn good.  I'm a huge fan of the BBQ Pork plate.  Delicious, smoked, tender barbecue pork that comes with two \"Side Cars\".  I've had their Mac and Cheese, French Fries, Cole Slaw, and Brunswick Stew -- all fantastic options.  In addition to the two sides, it also comes with a slice of Texas Toast as well.  Really good sauces at the table as well.

I really like the ambiance of this place too.  You can sit inside in a bar area (looks a bit cramped, but I haven't sat there yet), or outside at some of the wooden tables.  We had a lot of people with us, so it was just easier that way.  They really do a great job with this punk-and-motorcycles theme, and it's cool to see.  The service has been pretty good too the times we've all been.

Overall, a rad place to get your NC BBQ fix.  I dig it a lot."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Had heard great things but did not live up to hype. Good beer selection and the mac and cheese was very good. Ribs were luke warm and very dry, tasted like they had sat under a heat lamp for a while. Server spent more time texting than servng. Defintely not worth the price"}
{"text":"Food--plentiful and tasty. Atmosphere--lots of sports on the televisions, and unobtrusive music playing in the background. Service--very attentive, in that both our waitress and the manager checked in early and often. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We meet friends here and had an amazing time over a great plate of the absolute BEST beef brisket in Charlotte. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never have I had to walk out of a place due to service issues. We were sat at 2:20 pm and we are leaving now at 3:30 because the server never came back after getting us our drinks. I could understand if the place was busy, but there was only one other table in the whole place, and they were already done eating when we got there. Server was hanging outside talking to another person and looked over at us twice, but never came over to get our order. We couldn't even get her time to get our bill, so we left what we thought would cover our stuff. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had to laugh when I saw the \"red sauce\". My man, isn't that just BBQ sauce?"}
{"text":"Great addition to Matthews, as we have been waiting for more places to eat out but mehhhh. Mac's seems to be a Charlotte institution embracing bikers and babies alike but it's going to take me some getting use to.
I'm not a fan of sitting at high tops all the time so you could say I'm a little bias.  The service was okay but perhaps that's part of the appeal.  Our server had someone shadowing her which may have added to the delays but don't get me wrong the main server was nice enough.  Her shadow was maybe shy but it came off as weird so that was awkward (for example, we asked for water and she stared at us for a good 10 seconds before acknowledging she heard us and was willing to get it.)
My husband ordered the beef ribs and I ordered a salad with brisket.  after 30 minute wait our food came.  The server did come and check in from time to time and she informed us that beef ribs take a little longer....no problem....but then she brought him pork ribs....REALLY?!?!
Then she tried to convince my husband that he asked for pork ribs....Lady didn't you just tell us the beef ribs are what was taking so long???  My salad was fine but I wasn't crazy about the brisket.  It wasn't very flavorful but it had some sort of sauce on it.  
All in all I would probably go back and try something else as this was probably a fluke but I need a little more convincing...."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, loved all 4 sauces.  Staff was friendly, good beer selection, clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday for lunch. This is a very popular and busy spot, saw a very diverse crowd from contractors to people in business wear out on lunch break. Finding parking might be tricky, people sometimes resort to parking across the street. However there will be plenty of seating inside and outside! 

Got the pork belly appetizer and small combo platter to share between me and my boyfriend. The pork belly was good, first smoked pork belly I've had and I really liked the flavor! I didn't get much blueberry from it, which was the flavor of the sauce, but I still liked the sauce it came with. For the combo plate we got brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and ribs. My favorites were the brisket and ribs. The pulled pork was great as well, the chicken was a little lacking in flavor. Everything was pretty tender. I wish we could have gotten a little more of the pulled pork and brisket rather than a giant leg from the chicken but the platter was pretty cheap so it's not a big deal. 

They also had four special sauces, a mustard one, a vinegar one, and two bbq ones. My favorite were the two bbq ones which I mixed together on my plate. 

Overall probably the cheapest bbq I've had in Charlotte. The pork belly was $8 and the platter was $20. We could have done without the pork belly, especially since the serving size was pretty small. We were full off of just the platter. Service was fast, our actual waitress didn't come around a whole lot but they had like four guys who worked the bbq I guess walking around too and we just flagged them down. They also had a great drinks menu that looked interesting!"}
{"text":"There was a time I looked forward to getting BBQ from Macs, but sadly it's has slipped .. the Beer Can Chix is still good and sides .. but face it this is a Beer Bar now. All bar stools to sit on is not very comfy or good for family's with small kids ..best BBQ in Matthews is still Moes. Although they spent a lot of money to remodel a shack, for a cool million. Meh."}

{"text":"Local fav barbecue place. Cool set up.
I opted for the Burnt Ends with one side. They were ok. Kinda heavy on the fat. Would not order them again.
The staff was very friendly, Jamie my server was very attentive.
It looked like they had a good beer menu."}
{"text":"I got the black and Bleu burger and it was huge and juicy. It was very good. I would recommend  it. My husband had the route 66 and he only ate half of it. He also had the sweet potato fries and they were cold so we ended asking for a Hot order of fries which wasn't a problem. We also got an order of the smoked Wings which were good too. Overall the food was good"}
{"text":"Great food...and alot of it! Yummy fried pickles and bbq anything. Good selection of beer. Tried some new things that were yummy, like cheesy grits. Energetic atmophere. Just 'Ok' service though. Visiting from michigan and it was a great find!"}
{"text":"Ordered pulled pork BBQ, with mac & cheese, and green bean casserole. Meal came with Texas toast and hush puppies. Pulled pork was good, but the mac & cheese seemed dry to me."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ place. They can get pretty busy and the parking is limited but it's worth it. 
They have an outdoor area as well with it's own bar and TV. I think they do live music there as well.
The indoor part is set up long way with booths and high tops. Decent amount of seating and there's a bar with seating as well. 
The food is really good here. Brisket and the ribs are amazing. 
The staff here are great too. Just enough attention and very nice. Love this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because the place we were originally going to ended up closing super early because \"the kitchen lost power.\" So we came here instead. I like to say we made a good choice. We sat outside on the patio, they had picnic table's, had a nice feel. The wings here are grilled not fried so that's a good thing. I ordered the honey BBQ and they were fall off the bone good like literally. Also ordered a banana pudding for dessert that came in a tall glass mug. The BP was mediocre, taste like boxed BP, #Idefinitelyhadbetter #Iwontbeorderingthatagain #Ishouldhavegotthebrownieinstead"}
{"text":"I arrived at 5:45 to meet a couple of my friends. I grabbed a table and my one friend showed up literally two minutes after me. 
A server immediately came up to us and asked what we wanted to drink. She grabbed our drinks and brought us hush puppies (as their complimentary appetizer). While we were waiting for the last friend to show up she asked if we wanted to order an appetizer while we waited and I got the fried pickles! 
The pickles were pretty good! Burned my tongue a couple of times because I couldn't wait till they cooled off! Our friend finally showed up at 6:20 and the server was no where to be found! 
He finally got our drink, and she walked off before we were able to ask to have our orders put in. Once we ordered, the food actually came out pretty quickly.
The brisket platter was the entree I ordered. I got fat and lean mixed brisket, with mac and cheese and collard greens as my sides. The brisket was thick cut (which I do not mind at all) but it was a bit on the dry side. The mac and cheese was sooooo yummy. I could have eaten a whole bowl. And the collard greens were a bit too vinagery for my liking, but they weren't too bad. 

We were only checked on once, and then when she asked if we needed anything else we asked for the checks (and a box for my leftovers). 

The food is good (expect for the dryness of my brisket - but I did try some pork that was pretty good). But the server seems a bit slower and no where to be fine sometimes."}
{"text":"Good: wings are the best thing here and so many beers on tap. Best flavor sauce for smoked meat. Even the veg burger tasted very good which is very hard to get in smoke house."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you enjoy watching 60 year olds attempt to recapture their youth by doing burnouts on their Goldwings.  True story.

Sat out on the patio but didn't enjoy due to the smoking, loud noise/smell of the motorcycles. Neighboring residents had called the police due to noise from the burnouts.

BBQ was good but portions were tiny and prices were high.  Green bean casserole had so much pepper in it, it was almost inedible.  The \"whole lotta\" combo only came with one sausage link and it was dry and tough.

There are much better places for good BBQ and clientele/ambiance really needs some work.  Parking is also a real problem, just as it was when this venue was Vinny's/Finn's."}
{"text":"When this place opened - less than a mile from our house, we came here ALL the time - like several times a week.  Food was great and the service was super friendly - we got to know several of the waitresses - very nice.  but over the years the good servers left and the food has become horrible.  I will NOT eat anything perpared here.  I have gotten sick one too many times along with other people dining in the same group.  It is a shame because they have a cool patio area and we do occassionally meet friends here for a beer.  But the kitchen cannot seem to get their act together and I question their sanitation training."}
{"text":"The vibes in this place are great. Good atmosphere. I always get the teriyaki wings. I know what you're thinking teriyaki on a wing? Gross. Not true. These teriyaki wings don't taste like normal teriyaki sauce. I don't know what it is that Mac but boy do they know how to do a good wing."}

{"text":"I'm going to start this review off by saying that I really look forward to giving this place another chance on a non-busy day. My bestie and I were in need and in the mood for a quick catch-up over BBQ food. We came on a hot, July Saturday evening around 7:00 pm and was met by a packed patio and parking lot. We both ended up parking on a side street near the vet hospital (we arrived at different times). I got there first and was told there was a 20 minute wait and told the hostess stand that there was no preference in outdoor or indoor seating.

By the time my bestie and her friend showed up, our table was ready - it ended up being about a 10 minute wait. We were seated outside and our drink orders were taken. The outdoor seating was quite loud and sweaty. It was a 90 degree day but they do have fans, just not that many outside. I placed a drink order for a Sam Adams grapefruit beer. However, when our waitress came back, she let me know that their keg was practically out and gave me what she could. I ended up with a glass that was just a little under half full :) 

We placed our orders - I ordered the little pig sandwich (pulled pork) with onion rings. Our food came out extremely promptly which made me think that they had plates that were already ready due to the lukewarm temp of my plate. My onion rings, seasoned very well, were not that hot which is a cardinal sin when it comes to onion rings. However, I did like that they were not your typical, thick, and overly battered rings. The sandwich was just the right size but, again, just not that hot. Good but not great.

The waitress did not charge me for the beer and was very efficient with everything else and checking on our needs. I wouldn't run back to Mac's but I definitely wouldn't count it out. I look forward to giving it another shot under different and cooler circumstances."}
{"text":"I've been to Mac's Speed Shop at this location and the one close to Arsley quite a few times and both were alright. The ambiance has a very southern feel and they have both indoor and outdoor seating. I've been to quite a few BBQ places in North Carolina and Virginia and there isn't really much to rave about Mac's in my personal opinion. 

You do get free hushpuppies when you sit down with a nice creamy buttery spread, which is unique to most BBQ places. The only food item I would recommend getting here would be the pulled pork nachos. If I were basing my review solely on those, Mac's would get a 5/5. They have a great ratio of cheese to toppings and the portion size is huge. They have decent specials every day, with Sundays having $4 bloody mary's which is also a plus. 

However, besides those things, this place is just kind of meh. I've come here many times, trying various things on their menu to finally find something other than the nachos that I like, and have been unsuccessful. I've gotten their Asain-style crispy shrimp taco and brisket taco...good portion size for the price but the flavor was lacking a lot. Both their black bean and brisket quesadillas are very dry. I've had friends who have tried their salads and nothing really to brag about there either. I've tried their sidecar combo (where you can choose either 3 or 4 sides as your entree which is unique to most places) and chose to get their mac and cheese, chili, and a side salad. The salad automatically comes with bacon bits so PSA. Mac and cheese was okay and the chili was very very thick. Lastly, I've also gotten their pulled pork sandwich and pulled pork platter, good portion size for the price, but the flavor is just lacking and it has always been dry. 

Overall, if you want a relatively cheap meal with decent portion sizes, are in the mood for BBQ/Southern style food and do not really care too much about the taste, I would recommend going here. Nothing has tasted bad, it just doesn't really taste good to me in my opinion. Service has always been fast and polite. You won't exactly be disappointed, you just won't go bragging about this place to your friends after in my opinion."}
{"text":"I met my daughter for lunch and we ate at Mac's Speed Shop. Good thing I got there early as parking is not plentiful. I got a space in their lot but my daughter had to park down the street.  So be warned. It was very crowded which was a good sign. The place has a lively vibe and the menu choices are certainly ample.  They give you a basket of hot, delicious hush puppies with a cinnamon-like butter while you wait for your food. SCRUMPTIOUS!!  I had a beer chicken with collard greens and baked beans. The banana pudding for dessert was pretty good too. There are a variety of bbq sauces on the table. I enjoyed my food and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Came into Charlotte for business and they picked this place for dinner. Wooo! Probably the best wings I've had and could have ate just an order of those. Smoked, spicy, sweet, quality wing....have to say they killed it on that one. Everyone had to say something about em. Had the sampler small plate and that was great too."}
{"text":"Combo biker bar and family barbecue joint, this place straddles the line perfectly. My husband and I love coming here and sitting outside with our pup on the big picnic tables. The food is good quality and very reasonably priced. At peak times it can be busy and the waitstaff can have a little trouble keeping up, but as long as you're in a relaxed mental state, it shouldn't be enough to bother you. My favorite items are the spinach salad, the fried catfish taco and the fried shrimp taco. I also really love getting the switchback salad with the blackened shrimp on top, when I'm feeling healthy but still want something delicious. The drink specials are usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"OMG, is all you would have to say about this place. It's amazing! I spent the last year in TX and didn't have anything remotely close to this. I have to say the Carolinas have BBQ down. The NC BBQ sauce and the SC mustard sauce was unlike anything I've ever tried..... the portions are beyond shareable or plenty leftovers any which way you do it you win! The only negative and I say that loosely was that there was an up charge for the combo plate \"whole bunch\" for choosing the spareribs and brisket which was not printed on the menu. I say full disclosure on pricing is a MUST. That aside it was pricey but worth every penny or in this case dollar."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or groups...TV's, cool man cave. Order brisket sandwich. I'm never a big fan of open face sandwiches as they aren't intended to be picked up to eat...brisket was good but not a pick up and eat sandwich. Spinach salad was excellent, Mac and cheese was okay...great local beers on tap. I liked the menu offerings and prices were very reasonable!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"An extremely pleasant surprise to say the least. When we arrived, from the outside look of the place I was not expecting much. With lots of red, the motorcycle/car theme was evident. However, the food was delicious, even for myself, a vegetarian. They start you off with the best hush puppies I've had (better than Gilligan's) and an immense draft beer selection. I got the black bean burger with some yummy mac and cheese which was all together only $7! Nice size portions and prices, and the meats I was told were great. Service was impeccable; Super speedy. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a little cheaper of a meal, but still want nice quality food."}
{"text":"Mac's has always been a favorite for us and I'm never disappointed. I really love the style of smoky barbecue with a range of Carolina mustard sauce to spicy tomatoe-y red sauce. Things I love are the 'pork wing' (trust me), veggie burger, brisket, and pulled pork (go ahead and go for the BIG pig sandwich if you're debating).  Their totally addictive side items are awesome. Onion rings, green bean casserole, mac n cheese, Brunswick stew...all so good.  
And, the full bar including great specials and lots of local brew is great.  Goes well with the boisterous rock n roll atmosphere often well attended by the motorized biker crowd.  Be on a black leather lookout at Mac's!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and service. Very good food overall. They greet you with hot hushpuppies within seconds of getting at your table. Great sides. Had the beef brisket which was ok but have had much better. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Always love a trip to Mac's... Though not excellent at any particular style Mac's is pretty good at it all!  I've never had anything I didn't like, but I do love the pulled pork and smoked turkey.  I still prefer south blvd location but I think that is just because it's also the original, never noticed a difference in quality of food.  Per usual always a respectable beer selection craft galore!

One of those places I could eat everyday!"}
{"text":"Awesome Bartender, Kate! Very knowledgeable about the beer they served and introduced me too a couple new amazing ones! Will definitely be back for more! A+++"}
{"text":"We had the absolute BEST service this evening by Holly W...she was friendly & very attentive. She was on top of her game! We will definitely come back for her to wait on us!!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for bbq and decided to come by Mac's on the cool, rainy day. The food today is the best I've had here. Hot, fresh and tender. We got the combo with pork, brisket, beef sausage and ribs. We packed up half for dinner and started in on the rest. 

The pork was great (hard to mess that up), but the brisket won the afternoon. It was super tender and smokey! The flavor of everything was so good that we didn't even break into the 6 sauces on the table. 

My only complaint would be the amount of the sides. We got the biggest combo that comes with four sides. We could've used more mac and cheese, just saying. :) 

Finally, the music is good. I used to go to a biker bar in Gastonia (off Linwood, back in the day when a high schooler could get into a bar) and the music is the same. Nostalgic."}
{"text":"Always the same - in a good way - as in you can expect it to be tasty with good relaxed vibes. Friendly, laid back service. Outdoor area is one of the best in charlotte with numerous setups for seating."}
{"text":"Brisket, pulled pork and St. Louis Ribs were phenomenal!  1/2 Chicken and sausage were a little too smoky for our liking.  We also tried all the sides for our large party.  Our only qualms were the sweet potato fries tasted like they came out of the bag and the collards were a little too sweet.  Other than that, a really great first visit and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Based on the positive reviews my expectations were very high and it was a let down. 

 I'll start off with the good. The complimentary hush puppies were the best thing on our table and with the bacon butter it was amazing! The restaurant is big and there's plenty of parking. The majority of people sit outside,but there's indoor seating for those of us that like A/C. The servers were friendly as well. 

Ok, that's about it for the good. The dry rub wings were horrible and saturated in dry rub making them essentially inedible! Their St. Louis Style Ribs weren't tender at all and the Mac & Cheese sucked! As did the poor excuse for Texas Toast. Oh! I almost forgot! The fries were actually very good! 

We usually skip dessert when the food sucks, so we asked for the check and hit the road. If you've never been, don't bother! It's all HYPE."}
{"text":"Great place to get some good BBQ! Love the atmosphere. Waitstaff you can tell are just themselves. Not fake people just looking for a tip. Cold beer! I mean what else could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Have had many great meals at this location of Mac's. Tender bbq and interesting sauces, excellent hushpuppies, potato salad is great too - green bean casserole is a fave, though sometimes crazy salty? Sitting outside on a cool evening is terrific, as it can get really loud indoors on nights when the joint is hopping. We often meet friends here - kids at one table, adults at a nearby table. Everybody's happy."}
{"text":"Great place. Fastest service I have EVER had. Friendly. Pulled Pork was fabulous, as were the greens. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I went here twice in less than a week and the food is amazing.   The atmosphere isn't  really suited for me but I will eat good food anywhere.  I got the lil combo both times. You can pick 4 meats and two sides, more than enough food.  Between both meals I had the beer can chicken, pulled pork, brisket, ribs, smoked turkey, pig wing.  All of the meat was tender and juicy and had great flavor.  The brisket is a thick cut of brisket but it was very tender.  They have 4 different sauces to try at the table and I opted for the Carolina sweet bbq, it complimented the meats really well.  The Mac and cheese was good as well!  The chicken was the most moist chicken I've ever had!  Definitely a must stop if you are in the area and you might even see some really cool bikes outside!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be a lot better, but I feel like the aura and reputation of \"Mac's\" have unfortunately allowed them to slip a bit when it comes to the food. 

The beer, service, & atmosphere are GREAT, and that is what bumped the review up to 3 stars for me, however I'll explain why I continue to remain unimpressed by their food at this particular location. 

Every time I order, the food comes out in about 2 minutes. While for some people this is a good thing, it just makes me wonder how much of their food they're cooking ahead of time. I think they precook a lot of their meats & sides, and it's just like cafeteria style when it's served. This method, unfortunately, caused the meat on my Ribs to be really tough & chewy, and my mac & cheese came out so hot (microwaved) that I couldn't even eat it at first, I had to wait like 3-4 minutes for it to cool down. For my money, I'd much rather wait and have something that's fresh off the grill or out of the smoker... 

The food and menu have tremendous capability, I just think they are slipping a bit on execution; there's no doubt I'll continue to go back, as I've been a fan of their Southend location for years. I just hope that the kitchen staff at this location can begin to change their ways."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ in a super feaux biker bar full of t-shirt and sandal wearing Charlotte suburbanites being serenaded by a white Hootie and the Blowfish-lite cover band... Pure unintentional comedy."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Mac's I've visited in the Charlotte area.  We ended up here after a hot day at Carowinds and we wanted to get out of the sun and into some AC.  Mac's did not dissapoint!  

We were lucky- we had a large group of 8 plus a baby- and we were able to sit down right away on a football Sunday.  We planned it perfect and arrived right after the Panthers game finished.  They had some drink specials such as $1 off NC pints and $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas.

I ordered pulled pork with Mac and cheese and collards.  The sides were hot and on point!  My pork although was not hot at all.  I was not happy with that unfortunately but it was still good.  I also asked for their hot BBQ sauce and our server brought it right over.  It was hot, but edible!

All and all it was a solid visit, but I would've appreciated it to be a hot meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Steel Creek location. The inside is similar to the south end location and their patio looks awesome. Lots of TV's for any sporting event. I came here for an early lunch before dropping off my niece and her parents at the airport. We had a large group and we were seated right away. I ordered a bloody Mary and a salad. Our server was attentive, everyone enjoyed their food, and the baby loved the chicken wing meat. We had a pleasant time and I would definitely be back to watch a sporting event in the future."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte!  My favorite flavor is the Honey BBQ! The smokiness is perfect.  I also love their Chicken Nachos, hushpuppies and fried pickles!"}
{"text":"On my last visit I had their burger... overall I rate this a good place. I am a fan of BBQ but not so much theirs."}
{"text":"This place has been around quite some time and continues to get worse. Last night my friend had a bread tie in her BBQ, and My food was burnt so bad it was not edible. I honestly will not eat here again. The only reason they get one star is because it was free."}
{"text":"After eating at this location three times this summer, I believe I can provide a well informed review.  The food is mediocre. The service is mediocre.  One server obviously thinks bending over and flashing her unimpressive cleavage to my bf will get her somewhere. At our last visit (and LAST visit), we were seated at a very dirty booth.  There was (wet) food under the table that my shoe literally slid in. I mentioned it to our server and she offered to sweep it out. Since that (obviously) wouldn't work, we were moved to the neighboring booth when it became available.  Minutes later an older couple was seated at the (STILL) dirty booth. Nice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food quality.  Probably some of the best wings in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Good sauce variety, ribs, and buttery mac n cheese, but McKoy's has them beaten hands down on pulled pork and cheesy mac n cheese. I don't think you can really go wrong at either though. :)"}
{"text":"First visit will give second try. Order the large sampler platter for 2  ribs were not very meaty but nice flavor, chicken was moist and smoked, 2 nice pieces of brisket were excellent later realized we were shorted the pulled pork as our 4th pick so rating is lowered. How do you totally miss 1 of 4 entrees on sampler platter?? Kind of takes the whole experience down. Sides were good Mac n cheese,greens excellent. Our server treated us like she was doing us a favor waiting on us. Overall nice place and good value but could put a bit more effort in and be 5 stars."}
{"text":"We came here pretty late one night it was around 12am

The nachos were pretty good and so was the quesadilla. The service wasn't bad either considering it was pretty late"}
{"text":"I always love the switchback salad topped with brisket. Their brisket is delicious! They also have a wide variety of beers on tap, a lot of local also, which they highlight or have in a different color to help point them out faster! 

This is the third time I have been here and have not had any weird issues until this time. The people we brought got a sample/ flight of 4 beers. The 4th hey asked for was at the bottom of the keg, so they brought over a pint size, which was the last of that beer and told them to pick out another sample size.. The guests we had said no it's fine , and the waitress insisted on them getting a sample because she only brought out 3.. With a pint of the other which was not asked for. So after the waitress kept insisted, they picked another sample. We were charged for the extra pint which no one ever asked for. They could have EASILY made a sample size out of that last pint , very unsure why they did this, but end of the day it is what it is. Just odd.

Other than that, it's a great dog friendly place to eat outside as well!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, most recently today for lunch. The food I've had is good to average. Previously I had their ribs, which were good. Today I had the beef brisket, which was just average. I've had better, but I've also had worse. It was lukewarm. Today I had the cheese grits side, which was really good. The slaw wasn't that great- bland actually. I had Mac and cheese on my previous visit- it tasted homemade and delicious! 

I will say that we've had good service the two occasions I've been there. Today we had a server named Hannah- I would highly recommend her. She was friendly and efficient. Our food came out fast and she was very attentive to keeping our drink glasses full. My true review score is probably 3.5 stars because of the service, but the food hasn't been good enough to rate four stars. Overall this place is worth a visit if you're in the area and craving bbq meat, but the food is definitely hit or miss in my experience."}
{"text":"Biker bar meets barbecue. There are multiple locations, but he one just outside Charlotte is split into two main rooms, the dining room and bar. The bar has a garage door style opening behind the numerous taps, opening the area with lots of natural light. Each table holds a variety of house-made sauces (all of which can be purchased) ranging from straight flavored vinegar, to mustard-based, to sweet and hot. They host a \"Fatboy Challenge,\" wherein you have one hour to eat a 5lb. sandwich adorned with brisket, pulled pork, burgers, bacon, slaw, pimento cheese, onion rings, all on a sourdough roll, along with a side of mac and cheese. Many have tried, few have succeeded (me being one of them), a free t-shirt and meal to those who do. Flavorful, all the right textures, the bread was chewy on the inside, crusty outside. The wait staff is engaging and fun."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, typical Mac's food. Prices are reasonable. Wide and varied beer selection. Service was slow, seemed our server \"forgot\" is several times"}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ staple of South End. They have a menu which you will find everything you need for the food of this type. We had a first day server, who gave pretty good service. It's a great local place to grab some beers after work as well. 
Sometimes they give you hush puppies as a complementary appetizer. I always walk in expecting them but only get them 50% of the time. 
They have a GREAT outdoor area with live music on weekends."}
{"text":"This place has awesome BBQ, beer selections and prefect place to watch games!  I love their chipotle wing and smoke nachos!  Best places for some BBQ food!"}
{"text":"Close to the office, so it's a great let's-get-the-heck-out-of-this-metal-box-we-call-an-office lunch place. For all the non-meatatarians out there, the veggie burger is definitely the go to. It's a fried giant patty of vegetables (the base is some sort of bean) and you can add all the fixin's your little (clogged) heart desires with no extra charge. Yup, you can get several diff cheeses, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, coleslaw, onion rings, and avocado to make a giant knife-and-fork veggie burger. That is avocawesome. 

Add a nice local, cold brew and you've got yourself one hearty lunch..plus some. 

Lunch time rush isn't terrible, service is just okay (gotta chase down your waiter sometimes), parking is fine, and prices are pleasing. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I suppose this a local N. Carolina chain of BBQs.  Sadly i may not be a fan of N. Carolinian BBQ, but maybe i just need to try somewhere else too.  

This is a bar/BBQ joint so while we were there it was a bit loud and noisy, but i suppose our 15 top also added to the chaos that is the bar."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! The service and the food was supreme. 10/10 will return! Best French fries I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Omg so good. I have drove by this place for years and never went because it just doesn't seem like a place for me. It's like a bunch of bikers sitting outside. It's always looks packed to capacity. Which lets you know the food is good. 

My brother and cousin were with me one day and we happen to drive by and it seemed like it was a bunch of families sitting outside. We decided to try it out. I'm so glad we did. When I tell you they have the best smoked wings ever. 

Omg! So delicious and their Mac and cheese. We all ordered it and loved it. My brother had a BBQ sandwich and my cousin had hot wings. It was all good. Will def go back. Great service too. Our server was so attentive and sweet. Try it out you will love it."}
{"text":"This might just be a Northerner who doesn't like Carolina barbecue, but I found the food mediocre and not warm. My husband and son both got room temperature Mac and cheese. My son's chicken strips were tough. My husband said he liked his pulled pork, but my pulled chicken sandwich was bland and dry. This is where my roots may come into plays I didn't care for any of the sauces. I like vinegar but they were all runny and didn't stay on my chicken. It took a lot of sauce to get flavor.  Also they didn't give me my coleslaw, the tiny cup that was supposed to be my side of slaw was about a tablespoon worth. Ridiculous! $12 doe that?!?

Service was very good and staff very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My family of twenty were traveling from Texas and stopped in Charlotte at Mac's. We loved it! For a large group like ours, they got us seated quickly during the 4PM rush hour. Food was awesome from the shrimp & grits, brisket Philly wrap and \"A whole lot of stuff\"( shared between two people). Our waitress Misty was great too. Definitely will return in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always enjoy it. Tons of options on the food menu and even more on the beer list. I love taking friends here when they are in Charlotte visiting!"}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about Mac's! I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite crowded. So I was worried I might not get my food quickly etc. the waitress was prompt and I had my food within minutes. 

I went with the large pulled pork meal. The portions were massive and the pork was tender and delicious. They have an array of different BBQ sauces to compliment the meat. I ordered onion rings and Mac and cheese. The rings were straight bomb. They were cooked to perfection. Crispy but not overly crispy and the onions on the inside were perfect too. The mac was a tad bit greasy but nothing to complain about. 

It is definitely a place I will go to again. The prices are good, the service is on point and the atmosphere is 100%."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came to eat at night and the waitress was very rude to us. She was extremely nasty and she didn't even want to seat us. She didn't want to take our order and I felt very offended. I have had horrible customer service at a restaurant before but I never felt more uncomfortable at a restaurant in my life.... Would not recommend. Smh"}
{"text":"Combo platter- very good but was hoping it was a bit more fresh.....service was fine, I arrived a sunny Thursday late afternoon and it was moderately packed......

I'm definitely coming back...."}
{"text":"Tried this place again... got take out again, and I could go on and on about the cold food, the overly salty BBQ and lack of flavor and care. But I just don't have the time nor space."}
{"text":"Just took a chance and stopped in while we were driving through Matthews. The spinach salad with lemon Oregano dressing was delicious and the brisket was tasty and tender."}
{"text":"The wings here were really good and fairly large.  There was more meat on them than at most other wing places and the seasonings were great."}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting Macs late night. I typically go with the pulled pork dinner. It's flavorful and they offer some great sauces. They are open until 2am which is great when you're out late. The staff is always friendly. They have and VERY large beer menu and offer a rewards program which is nice. Their apple bread pudding is AMAZING and worth a visit just to try it."}
{"text":"A friend told me to check this spot out and said \"It's the best bbq in Charlotte.\" So I of course walked into the situation a little leery. My husband who is the reason we eat bbq all the time, was a bit skeptical too. However, we came, we saw, we ate, we loved. It's good ol' bbq and we good ol' love it. The service is friendly and quick and the wait staff is pretty knowledgeable on the menu. They have a large tap selection too. 

The seating and parking is a little tight but for their prices you can't beat it. I am surprised how well their menu is price compared to other bbq spots. Another thing that I really liked was that the wait staff is really laid back. It's not as uptight as some other restaurant and I really like that relaxed feeling, it makes it a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"I've been living in the South for about 6 years, and there's one thing I learned about being here...everyone has an opinion on the best BBQ.  Mac's Speed Shop can be summed up in one simple phrase:  Great BBQ with an edgy, casual vibe.  This is one of the few BBQ places I've been to where they have something for everyone:

1. The Outdoorsie - picnic style tables out front
2. The Dare Devil - super HOT wings that will burn your mouth off.  Just eat it all in one bite...I dare you.
3. The Healthy Eater - Great variety of salads with a ton of veggies where you can add a protein.
4. The Not-in-the-mood friend - for that one person who came to a BBQ place because all their friends wanted to go, they have Quesadillas, Turkey Sandwiches, burgers, etc.
5. The BBQ Connoisseur - you know this person is going straight for the ribs...and what a wise, delicious, tender, tasty choice that is.

Service can sometimes be a little slow, but I don't mind because I always go there to hang out.  There are a ton of tables pretty close together, so you'll want to go to Mac's if you want to be around a fun group of people in your flip flops and shorts while enjoying a great, casual meal.  Oh, and bring your appetite.

Now that I'm done with this review, my mouth is watering."}
{"text":"Southwest Charlotte now has it's own Mac's. The Que is as good as the original and the service has been outstanding on both visits, so far. The only downside I can see is the same one that the South Blvd store has...........Not enough parking ..... althought the lot is much larger than S.Blvd, the place's popularity and food exceeds its boundaries. I can't wait to try out the outside deck area."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some buddies on the net when I asked for a good BBQ place to go to.  It did not disappoint.  The BBQ sandwich was delicious, the free hush puppy advertisers were the best I've ever had (to be fair, the only other places I've tried hush puppies are seafood restaurants, so they always end up tasting like fish.) 

We had 2 children with us, and Mac's doesn't have a kids menu, but they modified some of the regular meals to be more kid friendly for us.  

If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Use to come here quite a bit, but no longer in the area. Went in for lunch today with my sister and was so disappointed  our server spoke literally to us ONLY when she had to. We were seated for more than 5 minutes before someone came and took our drink order and announced our server would be with us soon. She was. For about 15 seconds. She never checked on us, we never got drink refills, and it took entirely too long to get out check. 
Being a former server and bartender, I get the concept of a lunch rush- but I also pay attention, and our server spent significantly more time with her male tables. I usually tip 25% or more for even decently good service, but she was lucky to get the $4 on a $29 dollar bill that we left. I was so taken back by the lack of service. Only reason this review gets 3 stars is because the food was good."}
{"text":"Still great food and a great beer selection, but the service can be lacking. Waiting 25 min to get a drink is unacceptable. Step it up, Mac's. Give me a reason to keep spending my money here."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and nice, but was disappointed in the food. Chicken, collard greens, and Mac and cheese were good. The pork was over cooked and dry, but was better when I added some sauce. The ribs tasted good, but were a little over cooked. 

The brisket however, never should have been served. It was flavorful, but tough. It was the toughest brisket I've ever had. 

As a northerner, who's been looking forward to Southern BBQ, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited for an early dinner on Tuesday and was quite impressed with the food and service.  I had the smoked chicken wings with the vtx chipotle sauce.  Very good wings, very large and perfect smoke flavor.  I also had the southwest salad which is full of delicious stuff.  They have a good thing going here and I recommend this place if you appreciate good smoked meats and awesome beers."}
{"text":"I came to this location with my wife and two family members after accidentally typing the wrong address into my GPS (I was trying for the South Blvd. location.). The parking lot is a little cramped, even for the tiny car we took.

We were greeted and seated immediately and requested to sit outside, where there are a bunch of picnic tables. Our server was quick to get us waters and take our beverage order. There are lots of good beers on the menu, and most are $5 a pint. After placing our food order, we waited. And waited. And waited.

For a BBQ place, the wait is substantial. Eventually, an Eminem lookalike who was loudly rapping delivered our food (and some terrible rhymes), and everything looked good. One person in our group ordered a salad, and the server didn't bring his dressing until she stopped by to ask if we needed boxes. She was pretty bad.

The food itself is mediocre. The mac and cheese was fine, and the pork BBQ was decent. The ribs were the best part of the meal. 

Overall, I will not come back to this location. I might give the original location a try, but my expectations will be pretty low. If you want BBQ, there are much, much better places in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for BBQ!! And conveniently located across from my apartment complex."}
{"text":"I have tried Mac's once before at a different location and I wasn't very pleased.  I decided to give it more shot before I wrote them off.  I'm glad I did.  My wife and I went for a later lunch so they weren't very busy.  We sat down right away and our order was taken in moments.  I was surprised to have hush puppies while we waited for our entrees but that was awesome!  I ordered the pulled pork with mac n cheese and green bean casserole.  I used the vinegar sauce with my BBQ and it had a nice twang acidity to it.  The pork was also juicy.  The mac n cheese was creamy, not overpowering, and the noodles were just right.  The green bean casserole was also very tasty.  It was hot, steamy, rich, and a great way to get me to eat my vegetables.  This visit saved Mac's for me as I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"If you're ordering barbecue, your best bet is the pulled pork. It is pretty good. Ribs were ok, but I've had much better in charlotte. If you know brisket, you won't recognize what they serve here. As far as I could tell, they cut it before they cook it, or warm it after cutting it or something and then slather it in some sticky sauce to cover up how over cooked it is. Sides were good, but nothing stood out that I would recommend."}
{"text":"A friend recommended that I try this place while in the Charlotte area. I am a fan of BBQ, and this place had some good que. I decided in the pulled pork platter, but all of their food options looked good. This place has a biker theme going, but it also seemed family friendly, although that vibe may change as the night progresses. Overall the staff and patrons were friendly, the food was good and the prices were reasonable. I would check this place out again if I was on the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I live close to this location, so I am a frequent visitor.  The good is always great.  I like Macs a lot because it's a small, local business.  The service is good, always fast and friendly.  The BBQ is soo good.  They also have there own branded sauces which are also great and unique.  Anyone who hasn't tried Macs yet or is visiting the area, must stop in!"}
{"text":"Love the friendly service especially my bartender kate! She alway knows my order and is great at suggesting new beers for me to try!  They have an amazing beer selection by the way with so many rotating taps you'll never get bored!  The food is pretty awesome too and I love the variety of sauces that you can choose from!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Macs Speed Shop. I had a mediocre burger the first time so I decided to go with their BBQ which is their specialty. Not impressed at all... Actually disappointed is a better word. This place is good for a few drinks and ambiance only. Don't eat the food here!!"}
{"text":"Another solid BBQ joint in the South!  Had some good pulled pork here. This place had more polish than I like in my BBQ joints, but they made up for it with great service, good food and a fun atmosphere.

The pulled pork was moist and smoky, with the right amount of sauce added to allow me to add more if I so desired. A nice selection of sauces were at the table for my use in concocting up a mixture of sauces to my taste. The sides were tasty - my collards were cooked right, and my slaw was cool and creamy. The hush puppies were delicious, but probably overkill with this meal.

Still....I should have ordered the ribs.  I just wasn't that hungry though, having been travelling on business. We also arrived at Mac's pretty late so I didn't want to sleep on a full BBQ belly later.

Mac's has a bit of a biker bar vibe.  The staff has more ink in them than the Staples pen aisle. It was like being served BBQ by living murals.  But the Southern charm won out and our server was delightful and fun.  I would definitely be back to try the ribs. I sampled the brisket and it was very good.

The Count eats BBQ across the world in his many travels through exotic lands. The South is the BBQ capital of the world and North Carolina has its own style - which is excellent!

Give Mac's a try. It is enjoyable and the BBQ is quite representative of the NC style."}
{"text":"This is a good hangout. Loads of beer and the wine is generously served for $8.00 a glass. We got some good hush puppies that are on the house and got the sampler- the pork,ribs and chicken were plentiful but only 1 small slice of brisket. The sides were good and the Texas toast was cold, dry and had no taste."}
{"text":"Great amount of BBQ for an affordable rate and was very tasty. Also enjoyed their Mac and cheese very much!"}
{"text":"Great service... Variety of beer and menu had a good variety of options.. I definitely would visit again.."}
{"text":"You ever hear of a thing called technique?   Kitchen skills?  Random frizzly bits with big chunks of pork on my sandwich?  Who made this sandwich?  Your outside brown is more like Texas Brisket bark.  Learn how to smoke your meats and learn how to present them.  Thanks."}
{"text":"The beer can chicken was so much better than expected. I would go back for that and the hush puppies. The bartenders were friendly and many beer options."}
{"text":"Had this place on the list from  a food network map or show or something or other.  I read best in Charlotte! While visiting Charlotte for 2 weeks for work we made 3 stops here.   The first night we just had drinks since we ate elsewhere for dinner.  Nice service and reasonable drinks. 3 of us came for lunch a few days later.   3 pulled pork sandwiches, 2with mac and cheese and 1 with fries.  All fantastic.   Might be the best pulled pork sandwich ever.   The mac and cheese was really good but then I had 2 more mac and cheeses elsewhere that blew this out of the water!  Also had fried pickles that were really good.   tabasco flavor if I recall correctly.   Waitress was great and got us in and out in a hour since we were on our lunch break.    Mac's was getting a 5 from me at this point.  Then went again for happy hour.   Didn't plan on eating but once the waitress solicited half price tacos we were sold.   My friend liked her shrimp ones but I didn't care for the beef brisket. they were a 2 in my book.  and the chips and queso were also a 2.   Salsa 3.    Final rating will be 3.  But Macs, I will be back for the bbq pork when in town!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a local hotel and the shuttle driver suggested I try this place for BBQ. I walked in on a busy Friday night and found a spot at the bar within a few minutes. The bartenders are great. Very attentive and they know the menu. One was happy to give me suggestions. I started with The Chopper with balsamic. Fresh and tasty and plentiful. The kitchen was pumping out food to a slam-packed place just before the UNC vs Duke game. I took the recommendation and had the brisket with mac n cheese and green bean casserole. The brisket was just fatty enough and the sides were outstanding. Would have loved to have dessert but I was stuffed. Check this place out. Great!"}
{"text":"Their wings are the best I've ever had. They have a lot of meat on them. A small order was about 8 wings or so. We did takeout for a football game and it was great! (They did make a few minor mistakes on our order, but the food was still so good we didn't really care.) You can't go wrong with the ribs or brisket either. We will definitely be back several times."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, with a variety of locals on draft. Very quick service, to a fault, because they must just have the meat on a plate ready to go, as mine was cold. The pulled pork, aside from being cold, was decent, and they had a variety of tasty sauces. However, for a place named \"Mac's\", their mac and cheese was so disappointing. Actually the worst I've ever had. Save for the small patch of shredded cheese on top, I thought they forgot to add cheese to this batch. It was just like eating lukewarm, watery, overcooked noodles. I don't recommend it to anyone. But overall servers were nice and attentive, and it was still crowded before dinner hours, so maybe that's how North Carolinians like their BBQ and mac. To each his own."}
{"text":"Having frequented the one on South Blvd while working, I was so excited when this one opened up in Matthews, where I live.  My 4 y/o daughter and I visited on a weekday morning, about 20 minutes after they opened.  I thought it would be pretty quick service since we were there pretty early...but never realized how quick.  We were seated immediately.  I ordered the wings to start with and then a kids meal and a platter.  My wings came out about five min later.  They were rubbery...didn't feel like they'd been really smoked which is what I love Mac's for.  Even my daughter being a wing-lover couldn't finish two wings.  The waitress then brought me my check two minutes after we got our wings (before my entrees arrived) and had the audacity to tell me to take my time.  I somehow felt like my daughter and I were rushed to leave before their \"real\" lunch customers got there.  So disappointed.  I won't be visiting again.  Save your money and go to the one on South.  Service and food are both 10x better."}
{"text":"Great wings and BBQ.
We especially loved the dry rub!
They completed our order in a very short time!
Great job, and the phone person whom I called in initially was really patient!"}
{"text":"The signage outside states Beer Bikes BBQ. NOT misleading, yet understated. Excellent food, brisket to die for, service with a smile, and Valerie."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love it the hush puppies and the burnt ends are exceptional I enjoy the pulled pork the baked beans and macaroni and cheese only thing I'm not crazy about is the seating I wish they had booths"}
{"text":"Awesome food, I had the special at lunch and it was great. There's a lot to look at as well as a bunch of decorations and signage. There was a ton of waitresses. They were all nice especially ours. I'd love to come back and will if I'm in town again. The brisket is so good it doesn't even need sauce!"}
{"text":"I went to Mac's for a last meal with friends in Charlotte, where I spent the weekend for a wedding. A few friends (also visiting) had gone and said good things, so I thought it was worth checking out. On first impression, Mac's is \"cool\". It has great ambiance, with outdoors/indoors seating, a biker vibe, and generally a fun atmosphere. Definitely a nice place to go with friends. It also has a solid beer list (didn't look at the wine/cocktails, was far too hot that day).

Regarding the food, my impressions were mixed. The wings were excellent (baked, as all wings should be, not fried), as were the sides (hush puppies, mac & cheese, onion rings). However, the BBQ itself was not good. We had pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and sausage. The sausage was good, and everything else was below-average. Somewhat disappointing after the excellent wings we had.

One more thing, if you advertise all sorts of different sauces on your wings, as Mac's does, it's important that the server know the difference between them and can tell us which wings are which. Our server didn't tell us, and when we asked him, it was pretty clear he was guessing. Underwhelming presentation.

I would consider going again, because the wings/sides were excellent, and the place has a great vibe. However, the BBQ itself, which should be the lynchpin of a restaurant like this, is nothing to write home about. There must be better BBQ joints in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best brisket I have ever had that wasn't homemade and possibly better than some of those versions. Ribs were also quite good although not the best I have had. 

Service was pretty good. They do live music outside. I'm never a fan of live music at a bar/restaurant because it is always too loud and this is no exception. 

I'm not a beer guy but they had the best beer I have ever had. Sycamore Salty Coconut."}
{"text":"My daughter brought some food home one night because it was waaaay more than she could eat.
I fixed my plate & my 1st bite of the Mac n cheese & those greens!!! I thought I was in heaven. The beans & ribs are to die for as well. It is definitely a place well deserved of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ restaurant. Their tacos are da bomb but try their wings. Best \"sauce\" - dry rubbed. Tastes like eating a charcoal grill but in the best possible way ever."}
{"text":"I loveee their BBQ. They have a combo platter in which you can choose any variety type of meats that you would like. Their rib could be better, I personally think 131 Main (only the Rea Rd location though is better). However their brisket is amazing. The meat is so tender, it literally melts in your mouth. Onion Rings cooked to perfection. Their baked beans has this amazing bbq sauce that is in. And their complementerary hushpuppies comes with this oh so delicious honey butter sauce. Their staff is very friendly. And I would definitely go again. You jus thave to make sure you go with a hearty appetite!"}
{"text":"Went last week with my husband for lunch. He left his credit card and was just an excused to go again the next day. The waitress was extremely attentive and quick. The only problem was that it took a little while to get the food out, so for those that are on their lunch hour. I doubt you will get in and out in a hour. You would have to get it to go. I love love love love their Baja Salad. I am trying to eat healthy and boy that did not disappoint. It just has so much flavor. The second time I was there though, there was no guacamole or sour cream in my salad. My waitress was so kind to bring out a side of the guacamole right away, the sour cream I did not mine not having it in my salad. My husband's bbq and the wings were excellent."}
{"text":"Hey...so the bbq here is good! Everything tastes pretty good...ribs, chicken wings, brisket. I have not had a bad option yet. The salads are awesome too. Great place for late night eats, when most places were closed, Macs was open and because of that I've been here twice in one week due to convenient late night hours! I have had a few drink options as well, they do a good Moscow mule and a great version of a long island tea. A great go to that is not too expensive but tastes good. Lots of TV's to watch the games...outdoor seating available and even live music on select nights. Great atmosphere for family and groups of friends. Wheelchair accessible parking, entrance and seating."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is always packed. I mostly eat pescatarian (fish only), and I'm giving a barbecue place 5-stars, so that should tell you something. Firstly, they've started serving bottomless trays of hot hushpuppies and butter. Talk about dangerous! And they are really good hushpuppies that are bite-sized and not too greasy. Secondly, the beer list is extensive, so every your pickiest friend will find something they like.

Food-wise, my recommendations for vegetarians/pescatarians include: 
Baja Salad - great flavors, texture, and big serving
Crispy Shrimp Tacos - great flavor and presentation
Black Bean Quesadillas - a little more complex than your standard quesadilla.
Side Car Combo (3 or 4 sides of your choice) always with Mac 'n Cheese, Green Bean Casserole."}
{"text":"Well priced barbecue accompanied by a great beer list. Nice outdoor seating and great service. Ate late and still had some good barbecue. Recommend the beef brisket which was mouth watering."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, but she was new. The complimentary hushpuppies were cold and hard as a rock. The sweet tea was good as was the mac & cheese. The green bean casserole was okay, a little spicier than I make it. The best thing was the brisket. There was enough to take some home. I may return."}
{"text":"Good food, absolutely terrible service. I have been to Mac's 3 time and all 3 times the servers have made me feel rushed and unwelcomed. 

The fist time, the server was clearly rushed, seemed agitated while taking our orders, and threw our food on the table as she made her way past us. 

The second time, my boyfriend and I were asked to move to a different table (shared with another couple) after already placing our food order, to make room for a bigger party. 

And the third time we went for a to go order (to avoid having to interact with the rude people working at macs). We asked for some to go cups for BBQ sauce and the lady helping us seemed to think this was an unreasonable request 

The food is not good enough to make up for the lack of service"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and the waitress is awesome!!!
Got to try the fried pickles...yummy we have stopped the last two years coming to the races. Awesome both times we have been here!!!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint, got it delivered through Favor so I didn't get to checkout the inside but I've driven by a few times, definitely a cool vibe there. Definitely some authentic and fresh BBQ. The chili was really good, I recommend it. Mac & cheese was a 4/10 but the pulled pork and brisket are  awesome. Keep it up Mac!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Friday to grab something quick before a wedding uptown. I have ate here many times but this time the food had no flavor and I wish we would have went anywhere else near uptown. We had Chicken Nachos which had no flavor really. Also tried the Deviled Eggs which if not for the slice of jalapeno would not have been that great either."}
{"text":"The hush puppies were cold and terrible, though they're free, I wish they'd have just not brought them out at all.  Was not super impressed with the pork sandwich, their vinegar sauce was not good. Waitress seemed more interested in \"regulars\" than my family. On top of that tables were sticky, no napkins were handed out, and they were out of a lot of their beers. 

Blah."}
{"text":"Charlotte has no shortage of terrific BBQ joints, but for my money, the Mac's in South End sits near the top of the heap. The Q itself is excellent, as are the sides (I particularly recommend their Mac & Cheese). My dish of choice is the Pulled Pork Platter, although the brisket, wings and ribs are also superb. 

But as good as the food may be, what REALLY keeps me coming back is the beer selection. Mac's has dozens of craft beers on tap and in bottles, taking particular care to showcase local and regional brews. 

This casual, family-friendly spot has ample seating, both inside and out, and service is friendly and prompt. Parking can be tight during peak hours, so be prepared to leave your car a couple blocks away. But whatever you do, don't miss one of the best BBQ joints in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I saw that Mac's was opening a Matthews location, but after a couple of visits, I'm starting to wonder if the short drive to the original South End spot wouldn't be worth the effort. The menu is the same, and the restaurant design almost identical (although Matthews has more parking ). But the pulled pork sandwich I usually love at the original Mac's just hasn't been as flavorful here, and fries are often overdone. Also, my first (and often second) choice from the extensive beer list is almost always missing, making me wonder if they don't update the menu frequently enough. There's nothing worse than getting excited about trying a new craft brew, and then finding out they just kicked the keg."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any more comforting than enjoying Southern favorites, like dry rubbed and smoked BBQ, Beer-braised Chicken, Mac 'n Cheese,
cheddar Grits, and waitstaff that make you feel at home. In the mood for something else? Not to worry-- try the Wing Ding. Grilled, dry-rubbed (which gives the wings remarkable flavor), and hickory smoked Jumbo chicken wings, tossed in your choice of favorite sauce. Smoky, sweet mother of God.


Some of Mac's favorite sauces and rubs:
- Red and Carolina BBQ sauces.
- Brisket and chicken dry rubs.
- SC Mustard sauce.

Side notes:
- You can take home your favorite sauces ($1-$5) and rubs ($8).
- Half price Mexicue (tacos and quesadillas) on weekdays 3PM - 6PM.
- On Tuesdays, you'll get a free kids meal with the purchase of adult entree.
- This spot is a popular biker barbecue joint and sports bar.
- If you are a craft beer fan, join Mac's Beer Club(BC), where you can track your beer roster and earn points - for every 100 points you earn, you will receive $5 in Mac's money to spend on food or retail merchandise. 
- Try Brisket Philly Wrap. Yummy!
- The Mac's Beer Club is where members can track their beer roster and view their points that they have earned."}
{"text":"I love the collard greens!!! If u like sweet collard greens Go here. Run don't walk lol. The chicken is OK, Brunswick soup is good, ribs are OK. I really like the sides here. They get it right!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and have not been disappointed. The hot wings are great, the pulled pork sandwiches are very good. A good selection of sauces to suit any taste. Reasonably priced and excellent service. My go to place when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing is as great as the original but this is pretty close. The place is a lot nicer and newer with the same great menu and beer selection. It's always seems to be fairly busy and noisey but you just cant beat the food.

Half priced apps from 4 until 6pm is the best happy hour special in town!"}
{"text":"Terrible on all accounts. Not one thing we were served tasted good. My boyfriend got the $17 beef brisket platter. No flavor and very small portions. He had for sides coleslaw and Brunswick stew neither of which were good. They listed Texas Toast comes with the meal but it was plain old white bread thin and smashed even thinner. My choice was a pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was flavorless. The pulled pork was cold and had inedible chunks of gristle. I had to spit it out it was so awful. The beer we had tasted like they were served in diety glasses. Just gross all around. The wait staff consists of pretty skanky chics. Not a great place and we won't be back, ever!"}
{"text":"If you come on the right day, Mac's has pretty good food.  However, this location has a pretty big problem with consistency.  Some nights here the food is fresh and delicious, but other nights the food is quite bad and tastes like it's been re-heated.  It's a real shame that this is such a problem because it's close to me but I don't know if I want to go back to this location.

Their mac-n-cheese, onion rings, collar greens, and pulled pork are my favorite things on the menu.  I love that they bring you hushpuppies for the table, because when they are fresh, they are crisp on the outside, soft and middle, and not dried out.  Their brisket is pretty tasty on the right night as well.  Unfortunately, we tried to order burgers one night and they were overly charred on the outside but still medium rare on the inside.  I couldn't get over the char taste.  I'm not sure if this is normal, as this was definitely one of their bad night.  I would also skip their sweet potato fries.  They were definitely not very crispy and were very under-seasoned.  

If you just want to grab a drink with friends, they have a good selection of beers and daily beer specials.  They have some regional and national microbrews on tap, with plenty of interesting and unique beers besides just IPAs, and a pretty large bottle selection.  Service is generally good, especially if you are drinking.

This place is almost always fairly crowded and the parking lot is small, so it's a bit crazy here at times.  They have loud music sometimes and the restaurant inside is small, so it's a bit off-putting if you plan to come for a quiet dinner.  The tables are crowded and when it's busy you may have to sit on an uncomfortable stool at a high-top table.  

Overall, Mac's has a few quirks that makes it hard to love. But when it's a good day, Mac's has some pretty good grub."}
{"text":"Stayed at hotel next door and needed a quick bite. Food was pretty good. Service was excellent! Fast and super helpful. We got the chicken dinners and the brisket quesadilla. Added a brownie dessert that was awesome. Family was happy!  I took it back to hotel since we have little ones and they wrapped it up really nice!"}
{"text":"I never got the chance to write a review the first time I came here so it is! Pretty much, it's damn good southern BBQ here. Moderately priced for big portions. Great spacious place  with fast and friendly service. Burnt ends are one of the best I've had. Really smoky and tender meat. Second time around, I got the dry rub wings. Definitely taste the smokiness and charred flavor. Big wings with lots of ranch sauce to spare. The mac and cheese was just ok so I would recommend skipping that. The complimentary hush puppies with butter sauce is amazing! Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice. The first visit was good, food came out pretty fast and I had a Guinness nothing too crazy. And then I made my way in there this past Friday by myself and I had a seat at the bar. Kenny was very friendly and engaged in conversation. I had the brown sugga from Laginitas which was heavenly. Great place and I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great wings and great beer!  What else can you ask for?  Really cool place in the heart of Matthews.  Wait staff seemed a little short and rushed but we didn't go without.  I got the brisket with sweet potato fries and collards.  Brisket was really good as were the collards.  Brisket was supposed to be \"fatty\" but I don't think there was any fat on it.  There was a gravy on the brisket that I could have done without.  The sweet potato fries were a little cold.  

In reverse order, apps were untouchable.  Tabasco fried pickles and wings were the choice and we couldn't have asked for better.  Pickles were thickly cut and well breaded.  Wings were grilled and perfectly sauces.  Two perfect selections.

One insider tip: if you sit by the front windows in the main section be aware of motorcycles parked right outside the windows.  Once those bikers leave the restaurant and crank their hogs all of the exhaust fumes come flooding into the dining area.  It definitely adds a different \"smiley\" flavor to the swine!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and we're looking for something sit down that wasn't fast food. Atmosphere is great. Service was okay. Food was good. 
Would come back- but try something different."}
{"text":"We just moved here from Ohio. We wanted to go to a low key \"local\" spot. The staff was friendly. Lots of people picking up huge trays of BBQ, so that tells you something. The brisket was okay. The pulled was awesome. Plus, they give you free hush puppies. Lots of taps and my cocktail, The Daily Ration, was great! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!! The brisket here is phenomenal! I keep coming back a few times a month. Very affordable, move staff as well. Great place to dine outside when it's nice :)"}
{"text":"I really don't know if this is authentic North Carolina barbecue per se, but it is delicious. I haven't tried the entire menu, but the pulled pork platter with two sides is the go to dish as far as I'm concerned. Combine it with a cold beer from the bar and you're in for an awesome meal. 

I'd like to point out that the pulled pork platter comes in two sizes - small and large. I ordered the small before while a friend ordered the larger option. For the price, the size difference is not that much more. I recommend going with the smaller option."}
{"text":"This location always seems to have a really great selection of beers and they seem to have them for a while. I think folks on this side of town may be more of the Budweiser and Miller crowd. I'm ok with that -- more craft beer for meeeeeeeee! 

The high points stop at the beer selection though. Service is pretty pitiful. Food is edible but nothing outstanding. Lucky for them, there's nothing much better on this side of town. Can you say captive audience?"}
{"text":"It was recommended by a co-worker of mine to try this place out since I was craving BBQ for lunch. I was pleasantly impressed! Most BBQ places around here that I've been to were just Carolina style BBQ (which I'm not a huge fan of), but this place wasn't limited to just that, very nice selection.

I got there at around 12:45pm (since it was recommended not to go right at noon) and I was a little intimidated by the amount of people there. I wasn't going for a dine in kind of meal, but it was nice to see the take out menu at the hostess stand. Honestly, it took me longer to figure out what I wanted to eat than waiting on my food. I was instructed to go to the bar to order my to go meal and the time it took me to figure out a tip and sign my bill, my food was out!

Side note: because I was on my lunch break, I didn't drink but this is def. a place I want to check out for after work drinks. I liked the  bar (was the longest bar I've seen in a long time in a restaurant), it was clean (not like those sticky nasty bars that you have to take a shower if you put your arm on it), and the bar tender that was there was really nice. 

The food: AWESOME!! I haven't had BBQ this good since I moved up to the Charlotte area from Orlando. I ordered the Texas Beef Brisket sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Normally I would go for pulled pork but I saw somebody else eating the same thing and thought it was worth a try. I was expecting the beef to be tough like jerky but I didn't even have to \"saw\" through the meat when taking a bite, it just separated so nice! The flavor was fantastic, not smothered in BBQ sauce to where you couldn't taste the meat. It's been a long time since i've had BBQ like that, where you can taste the meat you ordered instead of just the BBQ sauce! The mac n cheese, DREAMY! It wasn't greasy and it had a nice blend of cheese and pepper. So great!

The only down fall is their parking lot is really small and from what I hear (not just on yelp), it stays crowded."}
{"text":"I have been to Macs a few times over the past few years. I have had the best experiences at the South Blvd location but honestly I never go there any more due to the hassle of parking. I live in Davidson and my husband and I are constantly trying to find a good place to eat. We decided to try Macs today for lunch since we had not been there in a couple of years and it is difficult to find good barbecue in Lake Norman.  We ordered the brisket and turkey platters with sides of bakes beans, cole slaw, brunswick stew and mac and cheese. The turkey and the brunswick stew was excellent. The mac and cheese, cole slaw, baked beans and brisket were just okay. The brisket almost tasted like a prepackaged meat...very strange. After spending $33 for a takeout lunch, I was disappointed in the quality, and taste of the food. Unfortunately, we will not be back.  I like to support locally owned restaurants, but this one is not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places in the city! We got a little of everything combo! It was so good. They have 4 different sauces and vinegar based is amazing! I wasn't too crazy about the sides but the meat made up for it! Must try their whiskey mule it comes in a copper cup with bulliet bourbon! So good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is always friendly & accommodating. I've never experienced a long wait time. The food is always delicious. I usually order the pulled pork & mac & cheese. But the hidden gem on the menu is the apple bread pudding! OMGoshhhhh , it is SO GOOD! The dessert is big enough to feed two people. Seriously, don't order it for just yourself. Been there, done that, slightly regretted it. TRY. THE. BREAD. PUDDING!"}
{"text":"Great Carolina barbecue. I eat here a couple times a month.usually get the little pig and a side of the switchback salad. Quite possibly the best salad in Charlotte.
No.
Wait.
Not any more.
They just revised the menu and killed the switchback salad and the smoked turkey. Very disappointed. There is nothing else like it on the menu, so unfortunately it's time to start looking for a new barbecue place in Charlotte. 
Very sad, it's a Greek salad for heaven'sake. Put it back on the menu."}
{"text":"I\"m partial to the South Blvd location.  This location does have a nice patio.  I've only had the nachos here but they were different then the nachos at  South Blvd.  The service isn't as good.  The crowd is totally different and I've gone several times to see bands and the place is usually empty.  I still haven't figured out why but............whatever."}
{"text":"Love Mac's good BBQ and brisket, great ribs and chicken..... Very wide range of beer to select from"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here Sunday for lunch everything was amazing awesome the food and the service was all a great experience her name was Christina loads of fun we will definitely come back again and give 2 thumbs up to our family and friends thank you guys for a fantastic experience Happy Holidays to all you guys"}
{"text":"Pretty typical sports bars vibe. BBQ is good. Service friendly. But that piece of brisket - man was it good! Like a little steak, a little prime rib, and brisket all in one!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place so many times and had a good experience. Went this morning and it was horrible. I got a fish sandwich no onions. It was a greasy mess and covered in onions. The waitress never filled my water and barely checked on us. My husband ordered the BBQ sandwich and it made him sick. Literally sick. The manager removed the charge for my sandwich because it was not how I ordered it but NEVER came by to apologize. Whatever was working here is over. I suspect a new chef but I won't be back to test the theory. Green bean casserole is still decent but way salty. Too bad this has gone downhill. It was a favorite."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get the hype about Mac's anymore. This is the 2nd location where I've had less then stellar experience. 

I stopped in for a late lunch. They were not very busy. I ordered a chicken wrap and looked through their beer menu. While they still have an extensive list of beers, they also have those beers that craft beer nerds would consider undesirable and shouldn't be listed as \"craft\" beer. But on this day, most of the local beers were on special. So that was a plus.

The chicken wrap took forever to arrive which I didn't understand since they weren't busy and Mac's service is usually fast. And then when I tasted it, the chicken was dry and flavorless. I had to add hot sauce to give it flavor and even that wasn't enough.

I thought maybe my experience at their other location was a once and done thing but apparently Mac's has gone downhill in the chain which often happens when a place expands. 

But apparently some people like dry flavorless food in a biker bar atmosphere in a trendy neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Will always come back! Ordered their barbecue sandwich. To die for! However I came with a pal, and he said the grits were horrid. Also, not sure what the uniform policy is but last time I checked this place has a biker bar feel to it. Not hooters vibe! Young blonde girl in short shorts? Goodness. staff was friendly, but were loud with not many people in the restaurant. Could hear them over tv. Not a lot of available beers on tap.  3 stars is the food. Wouldn't even give staff a star if I could."}
{"text":"Lunch Jan 23

Best onion rings I have ever had...period!
Seriously, I was blown away!
Giving this joint 4 stars just for the onion rings."}
{"text":"We have always been big supporters of Macs and have visited frequently. Unfortunately, our experience tonight was not a very positive one. The service was terrible. We ordered our appetizer at the same time we ordered our drinks, however, we didn't receive it until 15 minutes after getting our entrees. When we got our entrees, we asked our waitress about our appetizer thinking she may have forgotten to put it in since we waited a long time but instead of apologizing for the delay she simply just turned and walked away. My husband had to ask multiple times for another beer which she then brought the wrong beer. Not to mention we had to ask numerous times for refills on our drinks. Lastly, she brought us our check and didn't come back to pick it up for a good 20 minutes. Overall very disappointed especially considering we didn't get one apology for any of the situations above. The food is always great, however the service left a very bad taste in our mouth. Extremely disappointing....


***** update - less than 2 hours after my review the general manager (Shawna) reached out to me directly apologizing for our experience and offering to send a gift card in hopes of a return customer. Very professional and generous gesture. We do hope for a better experience next time! *******"}
{"text":"Mac's is, hands down, the best BBQ in Charlotte. Better than City, better than Moe's, better than Sonny's. I think it blows them all out of the water. I used to drive all the way from Matthews to South Blvd. to get it, and am super happy they opened a location in Matthews.

On a good day, the BBQ at Mac's deserves 5 stars. My favorite is the brisket (I prefer a combo of fatty & lean), with the pulled pork following in close second. Both are fantastic.

At other places, the pulled pork can be tough and dry (and sometimes too lean), but at Mac's it's always tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat to amp up the flavor. I just finished eating a pulled pork sandwich with their SC mustard sauce and the sheer awesomeness of it forced me to write this review. I'm still salivating when I think about it.

For sides, you can't go wrong with the cheese grits, onion rings, or mac n' cheese. But the BBQ is the star of the show, for sure."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was just ok, my son's route 66 burger was too salty, po'boy fish sandwich sounded great but the hoagie was mushy as was the fried fish, ribs were good, good flavor."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits with a side of sweet potato fries.
Sweet and just right. All for $12 plus tip. That is with the 20%  discount if you arr staying at one if the hotels next door. Greay value and great food, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Great experience here. Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Wanted to try everything and the bartender possible pointed me in the perfect direction. Pork was perfect, brisket was also perfect. The chicken is quite good, smoked and grilled. The St. Louis ribs where also great, ask for them dry for the true STL experience. Plus then you can use one of the great sauces of your choice. The vinegar sauce is great! Thanks for a great lunch. See you guys next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The beef ribs is to die for.  Very tender,  falls off the bone  it's a large portion so I had lunch the next day for me and my friend-guy"}
{"text":"I love this place, The staff is really friendly and the food is delicious. They have been really busy every time I have been there but I have never waited to get a table. They have live music often and tons of beer selection. The only reason I have given a 4 star and not a 5 is because my girlfriend has tried to get a specific beer they have on the menu but it is always out. If it is that popular than they should stock more. just saying. other than that I love this place and do not plan to stop going anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. The food is great, as is the bar and beer selection. It's more of a bar vibe then a restaurant but I bring kids there a lot and they love it. I think their brisket is the best offering, plated or in a taco, burger or quesadilla. The burnt ends are my wife's favorite. It does get there busy during peak times and parking is a challenge, if it's full use the post office lot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this spot! I usually come on a random. I love the catfish tacos and the brisket quesadillas. I love the fact the manager is mingling among the patrons.  He is genuine and he really wants to make sure you are having a great experience at Mac's.  I was surprised recently as 100% good customer and my food bill was covered. I felt so special!!  I have never eaten one item on the menu that wasn't delicious. Sandy Porter location And the Staff rocks!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Mac's at two different locations.  This visit we had ribs, pulled pork and wings.  Everything was OK, but nothing really special.  Pretty much what you would expect at a chain type restaurant.  They have a large draft and bottle beer selection.

We would probably eat here again, but wouldn't go out of our way."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the staff was friendly and the food was tasty. A little loud and the layout has you sitting on top of each other, but I would definately go back. The also have about a million beers on tap if that is your thing."}
{"text":"I just want to clarify that this review does not reflect the location off of South Blvd....  I visited this location with the best intentions and expecting to receive the same level of service and quality that the other location has been so consistent in providing in the past.  Apart from the waitress forgetting our appetizers, the salad I always order and have been very impressed with at the other location, the Thunderbird, was about a third of the size and the ingredients were sub par at best.. Now being a seasoned vet in the restaurant industry, apparently this location has failed to uphold the quality control and customer service that I have experienced elsewhere.  Very disappointed and it's sad that this location could be a burden on other locations.."}
{"text":"I tend to forget about Mac's in Lake Norman but enjoy it every time I go.  We should definitely put it in constant rotation.  Mac's is our local biker bar which you can't miss all the motorcycle parking spots up front.

We go to enjoy the beautiful weather and live music on their huge patio.  THAT is the biggest draw for me.  Really, the music is fantastic!  They have great beer selections, often have specials and their menu is solid.

I enjoy the barbecue, wings & salads.  They are known for their mac-n-cheese, it's more casserole style than easy mac style.  Know before you go ;)  The beer can chicken is also a favorite of mine.

They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of TVs to watch a race or game.  They have a great location for anyone staying at a nearby hotel, but off the main road, so can be missed, if you aren't looking for them.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Was visiting my sister in Cornelius.  She called this spot a Biker Bar you can take your kids too.  Seemed pretty apt.  They have a pretty extensive menu so you should be able to bring a big crowd here and everyone will find something they like.  I had a BBQ sandwich.  The Que was ok, but the slaw was kind of boring.  Also got a pimento cheese dip which sounded like a great idea, but didn't work so well in application.  They had a pretty extensive beer selection.  Solid 3 star joint.  There's probably better options, but this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"St. Louis Ribs\". They were the worst Ribs I've had in 20yrs! I was amazed that my teeth didn't break off trying to pull the meat from the bone. Both people at my table who ordered these ribs couldn't believe how dry and tough they were. We couldn't cut the ribs appart with a steak knife. Manager did refund 1 order but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The BBQ was good I had the ribs and my daughter had the pulled pork. The smoke permeated through the pulled pork and the ribs. The sauce was sweet with a kick of heat, not enough to blow your head off just enough to balance the taste. The burnt ends for the appetizers are also good. I also had the bake beans which where really well seasoned. Overall I would give this place 2 raised hands. As well as suggest it to others."}
{"text":"Maybe just a matter of personal taste but all four of us didn't like the food. Tried the brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork. All the meat tasted \"over smoked\". It was very overpowering. Onion rings were rubbery and terrible. Beans were \"meh\" and mac and cheese was rather tasteless. Portions were also small and it was pricey. So disappointed. Back we go to The Smoke Pit.  One positive:  my husband said the Brunswick stew was good."}
{"text":"Personal favorite BBQ place of mine here in Charlotte. I frequent this location but I've been to both the Steele creek and south Blvd location. Service is always friendly and prompt, food always tastes fresh and amazing, even when I order take out. The St. Louis style ribs are my personal favorite menu item. The only suggestion I'd make is if your dining in, order your appetizer first then order your meal when it comes out, because their kitchen is fast, but that's a good thing! I personally just like to enjoy my appetizer for a little bit before my meal. All in all I've never been let down. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mac's.  The food is good, good staff, and they have a great tap beer selection.  I usually get the brisket in one form or another.  Today I got a route 66 burger.  You might not think of getting a burger here, and I didn't either, but it was excellent.  Cooked medium, just the way I asked, and it was juicy and flavorful.  Don't let the fact that it's a bbq joint discourage you from trying the burger.  You won't be disappointed.  Mac & cheese was good also.  I also recommend the brisket tacos."}
{"text":"3 TVs at outside bar today and none of them are on the Panthers game. Bartender says she can't turn one of the TVs to the game. Ridiculous. 

Otherwise, food is pretty good and it's usually a good place to catch the Panthers game, but not today."}
{"text":"Best BBQ at the lake! Service is amazing! Food is amazing! Service is amazing...yea i know I already said that but it's so true I had to say it again! I think they have all the good wait staff around working here! Eat inside or outside the service is still great. Most places forget you are out there or so it seems...not here! 
Last time there I got the BBQ wing! These were by far the best wings anywhere I have tried! No breading! Smoked and grilled...so much flavor and not just on the outside...flavor all the way through! Best selection of sauce! Keep up the great job! And if you want the best waitress there...ask for Brandi! She is amazing, attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time with this Mac's location- it just doesn't live up to the others. I've had Mac's famous Mac N Cheese many times now at both of the Charlotte locations and they consistently deliver. This Mac N Cheese was a mushy,watery mess. What saddens me is that people think THIS is the place people rave about when it really isn't even close. The other complaint I have is the salad lettuce which is thinly veiled taco iceburg lettuce with one cherry tomato cut in half and a couple bacon-bits. The AC was also not working and I spent my dinner very uncomfortable. 

If I had to go to this location again I'd stick to what they did well, the appetizers. I liked the nachos, pickle chips, and the wings were pretty tasty too. If you want the real Mac's experience head to another location..."}
{"text":"Macs is a solid BBQ option in Charlotte and a great spot in the South End. Large draft list, good food, and fast service. Free hushpuppies are a huge pro in my book. Live music a couple nights a week. Definite mixed crowd but that's part of the fun. Surprisingly good black bean burger (yeah I did get that here once) and yummy twists on classics like a Cuban and Brisket Philly Wrap. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their atmosphere and service. Their food is great and at a great price you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas I know good BBQ and the pulled pork is big time WOW!!!!  Went on a Wednesday evening and this is a happening place with a live band and lot's of bikers...and I mean GREAT bikes.  Great sides and the BBQ sauce is over the top, bought all three flavors to take back to Texas.  My only complaint is that it was VERY warm inside and they did not have the AC on.....hot and sweaty is no fun to eat!!!!  Again, a must go to place.  WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been back here after they did the renovations so this was our first time back here. It was a nice day to dine outdoor. The waitress was really nice and patient with us. The guys enjoyed their beers. A plus was that we were able to bring the dog along. Thought they had a band out there but they didn't but we still ended up enjoying our time out there hanging with friends and drinking. Will try the food next time."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Stopped here on a trip to Charlotte to scope out apartments since we're moving here. Got the combo platter and the potato salad and fries were delicious
 The pulled pork and brisket were good but the real star was the ribs. I'll be coming back just for those. Fall off the bone with so much meat!! The service was also super quick"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this location in probably over five years. My last two visits were for drinks at the bar. It's always a pleasure to be served by the Saturday night dark haired, tattooed bartender (I'm horrible with names.. Erin??)!! She is very pleasant and patient as I usually take wayyyy too long to decide what beer I'm starting with.. so that is much appreciated.

They're nice enough to bring out some QuietDogs for us to much on with the brews. QuietDogs? Yeah, HushPuppies... You're welcome. :)

They probably offer way too many beers! And, I say that because of my previous comment about taking too long to decide. I kid, I kid. It's great to have such a wide range of to choose from, they truly \"hop\" all over the map with their offerings."}
{"text":"Mac's is a great looking place. Actually both Mac's look amazing. Even the menu looks great, and gets your mouth watering. The staff is generally nice too. But once they've sucked you in and have your mouth watering for something amazing, it happens.

The time shifts so that you begin to sit uncomfortably on the stools and the noise inside the place pounds your head as the minutes tick away, while it takes forever to get the food out.

Now you know they aren't back there flipping burgers like at McDonald's and putting them on buns. The pork has been cooking for hours. It may or may not be cooking over wood, but that's a debate for another time. The point here is that it's been cooking for a good while, and putting together a sandwich or a platter from barbecue that's been prepared over a number of hours should take a number of minutes measured in single digits. Definitely towards the lower end at lunch or when you have uncomfortable seats (or both, as is the case here)

When it takes upwards of half an hour to get it out? Something is seriously wrong.

The good news is that the food is decent, but it just takes so dang long to get there that all that pent-up frustration takes the enjoyment out of eating to make it not worth going back."}
{"text":"This Mac's location is a new hot spot around our area. We have been 4+ times over the last couple of weeks. It still has a new vibe, large crowds, OK service, OK food, good beer specials (and selection)when you're told the correct one for that day. You get complimentary hush puppies when you sit down. Over all my friends and I enjoy coming here for the plentiful food options and for beer specials. 

I think we will enjoy it more one the new feel did down a little. I will post updates and photos when applicable."}
{"text":"After several orders of takeout from JimnNicks on Steele creek I am breaking up with them for Mac's! My order was ready when I walked in, check
Someone was at the bar to wait on me for pick up, check
My order was correct, check - this is a huge deal breaker for lunch take out when all I have is an hour

The small pork sandwich was huge! We both joked that there was an entire pig on our buns. I asked for a side of mustard BBQ sauce and ranch and the sauces were surprisingly awesome. The ranch is definitely house made, you can taste the sour cream! I had the small sandwich with onion rings that were so good I didn't want to share them. Whoops. I'll definitely be back. 2 sandwiches with a side and a sweet tea came in right at $20 before tip."}
{"text":"A laid back, fun and friendly place.  

The have a lot of BBQ and I think the best way to sample their variety is via the \"A little bit of Stuff\" plate. Its a combo plate, and you can pick 4 meats and 2 sides.  I had their pull pork and that was good.  Their ribs were kinda tough. The Sausage was FANTASTIC. Their brisket was also pretty good.

Lots of beer choices as well.

Overall, a fun place with good BBQ and beer."}
{"text":"Mac's Speed Shop in Charlotte is one of my VERY favorite places. Since living in CLT, i've probably eaten here over 20 times...it's that good. 

So where to start? The wings are probably in the top 4 wings I've ever had. Their Carolina Wing sauce is to die for. They are grilled wings too, which taste amazing. 

They bring you complimentary hushpuppies with dinner, which taste like a buttery breaded heaven, and they are served with this bacon honey butter - it doesn't get much better than that. 

I'm a HUGE nachos girl...have probably tried them at every restaurant that serves them in Charlotte. Aside from Midwood Smokehouse, these are the best! 

Surprisingly, their salads are AWESOME. They come packed with tasty toppings, and are served in a huge bowl. There are definitely options for the healthy eater when you don't feel like splurging. 

Their drinks are reasonably priced & their atmosphere is pretty good. My only negative is the headbanging music they like to play. Would be such a better atmosphere if they picked some better music, but i guess they are trying to fit the \"biker vibe.\""}
{"text":"Stopped here 3 times during a 2 week business trip. We had a rule that we wouldn't do repeats, but we liked it so much we broke our rule. The first time was just drinks which was fine if you like beer, which I don't.  They didn't have much to offer in the way of fruity girly drinks, but they came up with a few cherry vodka drinks for me. The 2nd time we came for lunch.  The waitress was great as she knew we had limited time, and the pulled pork sandwiches were absolutely fantastic! My friend and I both had macaroni and cheese which was really cheesy and delicious, a 3rd party had fries. The Tabasco fried pickles were excellent, very spicy and crispy. The 3rd time we came with a friend from Charlotte.  We were only planning on drinks but the waitress sold us on 1/2 price queso and tacos.  The queso was very disappointing with chips out of a bag. My shrimp taco was decent but I was disappointed that the shrimp were fried as that was not in the description.  My one friend did not like her brisket tacos at all, and I can't remember what kind of taco my other friend had, but he did eat them all! Next time I'm in Charlotte, I would definitely go back for the pulled pork and macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Service is terrible here. Sat for 20 minutes while the server talked/flirted with one customer. Clearly saw us and watched the whole time as we walked out. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Mac's has really good bbq, but the thing I like the most about it is how big their menu is. There are so many options and it isn't over priced. They also have my favorite mac n' cheese in Charlotte and awesome fried pickles!"}
{"text":"The 17 dollar brisket meal came with 3 slices of well done brisket. I was expecting sliced smoked brisket, and what I get what a half portion of over done beef (has grill marks on it). Don't order this if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Bbq done right   I didn't plan on liking this place. It looks so modern I thought it would be fast food and not the real thing. Especially with the word \" speed\" in the name
Wow, was I wrong 
The day was beautiful so we sat out on the patio at one of the covered picnic tables. Our server came and got our drinks very promptly. We had two dogs and they were welcomed with water ,too
Real smoke and slow cooked food here. Lots of selections. Several opted for the pulled pork on a salad. Great choice! The salad was fresh , good dressing and wonderful pulled pork. There was enough for a second meal
Ribs were wonderful,too. Meaty, Basted in sauce and fall off the bone tender. This also lasted two meals
Wonderful experience. Casual atmosphere, good service and good food.  A real winner. Good enough to bring out of town guests"}
{"text":"Best beer selection I've seen in the area. Prices are really great for what you get. I've been twice and loved both of my meals. I feel like this is the kind of place I'll bring out of town visitors. Downside is limited parking."}
{"text":"Mac's Matthews location is awesome! It's incredibly spacious with a nice, long bar that is great to sit at.

I went here with my dad on a Monday night, which was awesome because it was $3 pint night. The draft list was really, really good, with a variety of local and out-of-state crafts from a range of styles. We sat at the bar and also ordered food there.

I identify as vegetarian, but pulled pork is my weakness. I had a bite off the nachos at Mac's and it was sooooo good! I loved their mexicue take on nachos, and I think they really nailed it with the pulled pork. I also could eat their mac and cheese every day for the rest of my life.

What really made this stand out was our awesome bartender/server/conversationalist, Cassie. She was very attentive and made good conversation with us on and off throughout the evening. I was surprised at the number of people there on a Monday night, but she paid great attention to all of her customers! I felt very welcome."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday and ordered the catfish  with cheese grits and collard greens. The catfish was fried way too long. The greens taste a few days old and the grits were not fully cooked and grainy. Returned back the cheese grits for the mac n' cheese and that was bland.  My friend had their wings and he eats there every chance he gets and even he didn't finish his meal. 

 I would definitely recommend them having regular tartar sauce as a substitute for the jalapeño tartar sauce. Especially, when eating catfish.

The bartender was really cool. She has great customer service skills and makes the best drinks."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch a few weeks ago. I got the lunch pork bbq with Mac n cheese. I literally got my food within FIVE minutes of ordering. It was delicious.. The Mac was yummy.. The bbq had a smoky flavor and was perfectly seasoned. My server Stephanie should train all servers.. She was awesome! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it always pretty good. Lively, fun location with lots of beer selections. BBQ is tasty as well. Being from NC I usually am a fan of a the vinegar based sauce. Mac's vinegar sauce is solid but I think it is the sweet spot that is spot on. Delicious sides up the ante a little bit more. Lots of BBQ places in Charlotte this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm done.  Overall, unimpressive and overpriced?.  The hush puppies they brought out did not seem fresh at all, they were rubbery and chewy.  The wings had a nice smoke flavor but it overpowered the sauce they were swimming in.  The real turn off on the wings is the skin, it's soggy, almost raw like.  Also, on both occasions the service was horrible.  I imagine they'll go the same path as Vinny's..."}
{"text":"Macs is my favorite restaurant on South Blvd.  Rachel Sunderland always makes the visit excellent!"}
{"text":"Damn good BBQ!! Almost 40 IPA's and Craft beers on tap. The atmosphere is a fresh place to come in and just hang and watch the numerous TVs or jam with the music playing. If you're in the Charlotte area you need to give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Having frequented the Macs in Steele Creek we tried the Macs in Matthews last night having recently moved to this side of town. Hubby had a cold so I called in a to go order. I ordered the full chopped salad hold the bacon and a side of pulled pork. Hubby ordered a half slab of the St. Louis ribs, the baked beans and a chopped salad too. After picking it up and getting home neither of us got the chopped salad but a regular house salads and there was bacon on it. My pulled pork was overdone and I got the burned butt ends too. Yuck. Hubby's half order was a full order and his chopped salad was also a regular house salad. He got two salad dressings while I got one. The baked beans were over cooked too. All in all it was terrible. This is very disappointing as we loved going to Macs and I loved the chopped salad. Too bad I didn't get one last night."}
{"text":"I've had better bbq.  Was expecting deliciousness, but received average bbq.

Salad is a great value here - $5.  I guess not too many people order it or something, but it was so totally worth it.  Spinach salad was totally great.

The wife and I got a the \"A Whole Lot of Stuff\" combo.  We got the chicken, ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Ribs were ok, so was the chicken.  Pulled pork was dry.  The brisket were slices, like london broil.  Was not expecting that.  Overall it was ok.  Nothing special.  If I lived in the area, I don't think I'd go back often, if at all."}
{"text":"The small BBQ platter offers choice of four meats, I choose chicken, turkey, brisket, and St. Louis ribs.  Ranked in order of goodness, ribs, chicken, brisket, turkey.  The tap beer menu is also extensive and was offering $3.00 pints of Founders Porter.  It's hard to find that good of deal on Founders beer even in Michigan and Founders is one of my favorite beers.  Service was extra attentive and the sides of chili and potato salad were both excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's definitely one of my favorite places that I've eaten at so far!  I definitely recommend this place to eat at for residents and visitors of Charlotte.  I always get fantastic service when I come here, and the food is always delicious!  I've tried their chips and salsa and queso, their fried pickles, and their onion rings which were all delicious.  Their fried pickles might be the best I've ever had!  Their hushpuppies that they give you (for free) are phenomenal!  I always get the BBQ sandwich with Mac and cheese and it's great!  They have an assortment of BBQ sauces that are all really good.  I recommend mixing the vinegar base, the tomato base, and the Carolina one together and it makes an awesome flavor!  The sex on the patio drink is also REALLY good and I'm not even a huge fan of pineapple but it has such a great flavor! I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Love the burrito they have.  Kids love their mac and cheese.  Vibe is good, service is excellent.  Love kids friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"I've grown up in Texas all my life and have been around BBQ since way back when. But when I was in NC, I had to try out the different kind of BBQ that was offered here. I figured Mac's Speed Shop would provide me with a good idea of what east coast bbq is like compared to Texas. 

I ordered the brisket and sausage and was immediately met with an eye full of meat. The quantity is generous and the pricing is just right. I had a real blast trying out all the different sauces Mac's brews up daily. The BBQ gives you a sweet, tangy, saucy meats which is in quite the contrast to the Texas BBQ where its more dry, salty, rub flavors. 

I had to get a togo box from Mac's since the quantity was more than I could finish in one seating. I love the difference in BBQ's and its unique flavoring can always be had. 

Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best beef briskets I ever had. The service and ambiance was great as well. Ordering was fast, and food showed up in a reasonable amount of time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I tried to the Fatboy Challenge. 5.5 pounds of meat/onion rings/bread, and pretty much half the menu. You have an hour to eat it. I hate consistently for a full hour without stopping, and got a little less than halfway through it. The bread is equivalent to a full loaf of bread which is a stomach stuffer, and the thing that did me in was that they drowned every level of the sandwich (if you can categorize it as a sandwich) with the hottest sauce they had. After the 5th bite, my sinuses were already out of the race. It was fun trying though. I did it at the same time as a friend. We both got to the same point and agreed they could have given us 2 hours and we still would have failed. Waitress was very cool, so were the managers who came out to hang with us while we tried. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice and truly love it. The pulled pork sandwich is my favorite dish. I had the biggest size sandwich and every piece of pork in this sandwich was perfection. No fat, all meat. We shared a banana pudding dessert which was light and creamy. I was giddy. The service was great too. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"We have been there 3 times... First time was awesome, second not so, today our food went in the trash.... food was terrible.... the Mac's on Sandy Porter outshines this establishments food 100 percent.... needless to say we were very disappointed. 

Food was extremely cold, full of fat and the green bean casserole was mush.. I have never given an establishment a bad review but this one time it deserves to be known.

Not sure if the same person owns both Mac's but the location on Sandy Porter in Charlotte is def. doing something right. 

We live in Huntersville so of course Cornelius is much closer however we will travel south and get what we pay for..."}
{"text":"Every time that we have the opportunity we go to Mac's Speedway. Normally in Cornelius but at this one last evening. Ashley, bartender, was wonderful. Helped us decide which craft beer to drink. Pernicious was the winner!  We shared the done-to-perfection wings (side of Carolina sauce) and the three side combo; i.e., onion rings, collards  and fries.  The house hushpuppies too. Everything rocked. Looking forward to our next trip to North Carolina. Soooo.  Give these folks a try. It's the best. Wish they were in Seminole FL and Pittsburgh, PA - we would have it all."}
{"text":"Had lunch and loved it.  Love the Liv Tyler look a like. Came back for dinner and drinks. Definitely cool place to be. Too bad the rain was around. Would of loved to sit outside. Courtney was great, warm and friendly. Recommend lots of beers ($3 pints).  We'll be back.

We did go back the next night.  Excellent drinks and food. Dana was helpful, fun and entertaining."}
{"text":"First time at the new spot was AWESOME. Madison was amazing. Friendly, attentive, FINE AS HELLLLLLLLL. Chill atmosphere, I like how there is a loud ass interior along with a quiet exterior area. Get the sampler with 2 servings of brisket. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was the best I've had yet. This place blows Sonny's BBQ out of the water. Everything was sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"So glad something went in this location, we really needed something here. Lots of beer, full bar and wine. Usual bar food, burgers, wings, etc. my husband is low carb and loves the warm pork rind app. Lots
Of tables, outdoor deck too. 

Like the atmosphere on the South blvd location better. I have seen several celebs and their families at that location. Which my out-of-towners loved. Never bothered the people but just seeing them gave the visit a cool vibe. 

Parking lot,casual dress"}
{"text":"Great BBQ . The brisket was perfect, not too soft hand held together ! Had to cut it with a butter knife! 
Great pulled pork and had Brunswick stew as a side. Excellent food !
It's an great spot to hang and drink beers and people watch!"}
{"text":"I feel that Mac's is over-hyped, claiming they are the #1 BBQ joint in Charlotte. I've had better, way better. In fact, my husband and I own a smoker and are avid fans of smoking meats/BBQ, and I would pick his over Mac's any day. 

My husband and I got a to-go order last night. Maybe this was the mistake! He had a small sampler platter: ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and brisket with mac-n-cheese and baked beans. I had the brisket quesadilla. I will commend the hostess staff as they grabbed a waitress to get the food from the bar for me. I couldn't leave the front door area as I was parked in a handicap spot (no to-go parking and the lot was slammed), and I was swinging through after a pedicure. 

I wish I would have taken pictures of the food, especially his. It was not appetizing at all. Everything looked burnt! And when you opened the box, the strong smell and heat of smoke came flying out. I had bites of everything so I can vouch for his opinions on the food: the ribs were tough and did not fall off the bone, the pulled pork was good (as usual), the sausage was almost black and so dry it tasted like beef jerky, the brisket looked like a McRib strip, and was dry and over-smoked, and the mac-n-cheese was pretty good. *We didn't eat the baked beans.* Overall, most of his meat was dry, over-smoked, burnt, and chewy (like it had been smoked 2 days before and then re-heated on a super-hot grill or in the microwave).

Onto my dinner: mine was definitely much better than his. The brisket was juicy in mine, and came with onions, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos. I added their signature BBQ sauce (vinegar based) for a kick. It was a good quesadilla with good flavors.

We've had much better experiences at other BBQ joints, for less cost. If we would have dined-in, we definitely would have sent the food back and informed the manager. I highly doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Best place for BBQ! First time here so I tried their combo plate alittle. You can pick four different types of meat and get two sides, all for 20 bucks. I picked ribs,brisket and double smoke sausage. OMG! So delicious! Meat flavorful, really moist. Great portions for the price. You have a great selection of sides. I enjoyed the onion rings, which were seasoned nice and green bean casserole also good. Plus they give you hush puppies with sweet butter complimentary. You do not walk away hungry! Sports bar atmosphere. People friendly. Some kind of drink club offer, would be great if I still drink. I will just have to settle for great food!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. The BBQ is decent (its not Lexington), and the staff is usually fairly friendly."}
{"text":"Mac's has a great atmosphere and delicious food!  The restaurant is more spacious than the south Charlotte location, and the clientele is a mix of all kinds of folks.  They play awesome rock music.  We haven't found a single thing that we did not love, but the deviled eggs, pork BBQ, onion rings, and mac and cheese are my personal favorites. Their beer list is extensive and reasonably priced (as is the dining menu).  Service is fast and efficient. Mac's has become one of our favorites for their great food and value!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and 94°...Let's say it's beer and smoked bbq time ...after church, of course. First, early afternoon golf , go carts whatever.  Then arrived around 3, hostess and wait staff attentive and friendly and fast! 
$1 off domestic drafts from N. Carolina, and very complete selection. Sierra Nevada summerfest purrfectly brewed and the compliment to Mac's smoked selection. First, get the wings nude and add your sauce selection after. Expertly lightly smoked with subtle dry rub,.. you may forgo sauce. Try Mac's vinegar only for a salt and vinegar flavor distinct from the standard palate. Little pig squealing good.., beef smoked sausage upscale with 2 mustard service...and plz try the greens with pork belly, after all this iz  N. Carolina, ...um um um.
You select sport tv channels and southern rock background tunes make this your he/shecave home away from home...Go Panthers!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  They always have great beers on tap & the lil pig sandwich is plenty of food for lunch or dinner. We take my Dad here when he comes in from KC and he likes the BBQ."}
{"text":"Man...what a sublime evening. 

There are two things that I am a huge fan of, craft beer and smoked meat and this place checked both of those boxes nicely. 

My server was Elizabeth and she was knowledgeable about the local beers (I am from Colorado) and she recommended some great beers to try. They have a FANTASTIC beer list. If you are a craft beer hound like myself, you won't be disappointed!

I had the combo platter because I wanted to try several things. The pulled pork was just amazing. So smoky and moist. The beer can chicken was the best beer can chicken I've ever had. Just fantastic flavor. The ribs were tasty. I could have passed on the beef sausage, because it just paled next to that chicken and the pork. 

Laid back atmosphere, absolutely my kind of place. Made me sad I don't live here!"}
{"text":"I give this a place a 4 since my pedigree for Carolina BBQ is being a Seattleite. Pulled pork sandy is a 5 really great mustard sauce. Creamed corn was better than most...collard greens seemed good.
Great service on my visit. Equal to 2 other Carolina BBQ restaurant visits.
Go hear and enjoy."}
{"text":"I might be the only person who gets annoyed as sh!t when servers call me baby, or darlin or sweetheart or Shug or what the f ever. 

If I am then so be it...

Brandy(sp) was nice and attentive as all servers should be, but she must be used to dealing with Momma's Boys who need attention and/or lonely travelers who have a lack of self confidence and self esteem. 

She is the Queen of these (un)affections. 

If it was only for this I would have reviewed this place higher. 

The real problem is \"somehow\", literally everything I ordered was exactly $1 more on my bill than was listed on the menu. That's an uncanny coincidence 

When I mentioned this to Brandi(sp) she was sympathetic and went to see what the deal was. 

When she returned, she apologized, I asked her what happened and she fumbled through \"it was a computer problem.\"

Fair enough. 

Alas, I can pay my bill and leave. 

Goodness me, there's still an item on my bill that is exactly $1 over the menu price. I'm perplexed, yet at this point I just don't give a rat's a$$.

So I pay the bill and (reluctantly) tip better than 15%, although I'm not exactly sure why? Maybe because deep down I want to believe that Brandee(sp) was innocent of any wrong doings, or maybe she has an injured feline at home who needs medical care and can't foresee another means to cover those unexpected expenses? Either way, I did my part. 

In Summary,
*The food is average at best. 
*The live music was present, although I chose not to partake in the festivities because, well it's muggy and buggy and there's this weird open drain thing in the parking lot that clearly has sewage and/or feces permeating from it?!?! *Probably from the hotel next door 
*The service is ok if you embrace the terms of endearment. 
*The price is ok, just watch out you don't get pencil-whipped by that dang computer!
*The drinks are drinks 
*The location is easy to get to
*The atmosphere is biker-esque 

-Good Day"}
{"text":"Honestly I can't figure out why everyone loves this place? The food is average and service poor. I've been here three times and tried a burger, pulled pork and some apps. Nothin was great. The burger was burnt tasting and super greasy. The Mac and cheese is ok. The pulled pork is good but don't like any of their BBQ sauces. They don't have a normal sauce.. All vinegar or mustard based. Brunswick stew is super spicy but doesn't say that on the menu. Was so hot I couldn't eat. Fried pickles are super salty. The only good thing I have had is onion rings and a wide selection of beers.

{"text":"During a recent business trip, I stopped into Mac's with some coworkers based on their recommendation for the beer selection. While I was set on exploring a local brewery we ended up here, and luckily they had a massive beer list with a number of local beers many of which were available on draft.

Beer selection is the real highlight of Mac's however after sitting and socializing over work for a bit, we decided it was time to grab a bite to eat. I decided to go with the Carolina Beef Brisket, which is 9 oz. of your choice of lean, fatty or both, dry rubbed & slow smoked for 12 hours & finished on the grill with our Western NC BBQ sauce, served with caramelized onions. I wasn't given the choice of what type of cut I preferred and received a lean thick cut which after being grilled again it seemed dried out and really lacked any flavor, luckily the bbq sauce helped a bit. Personally, I could have gone without the brisket being grilled and cooked again. I probably should have just went with a burger instead.

The atmosphere here is more of a dive sports bar, however, it was a pretty relaxed vibe with plenty of TVs to catch your favorite game. Prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly however I am not sure I would return for the food."}
{"text":"Always a guarantee. Don't expect the best service you'll ever get (kind of goes along with the biker bar theme) but the food and drinks make it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"I am in no way a barbecue expert.  That being said, I tend to be a bit of a barbecue snob.  

But I'm not one to turn down my nose at barbecue that may not be \"authentic\".  I'll eat anyone's barbecue.  But I know the difference between good and great.  

Let me put it to you this way.  After one taste of the barbecue here at Mac's, I now know why true barbecue snobs turn up their nose at what they consider to be inferior barbecue.  

Because you just get the sense that this is the way it is supposed to be.  

So now, me being a Philadelphia area guy, I now have had a taste of true authentic Carolina barbecue.  And I don't think I'm going to be able to look at anything else the same way again.  

I tasted the sampler when I was here with pulled pork, beer can chicken, brisket, and ribs.  My first bite was of the pulled pork.  No sauce because I needed to taste it as is to truly judge it.  I'm a firm believer that good barbecue doesn't need the sauce.  

Man, that first bite floored me.  The smoke was intense, the juices were flowing, this was perfect!  

I almost decided not to use any sauce at all.  But I did eventually sample the red, and it was wonderful as well.  

Then, the brisket was next which was good.  Maybe a little tougher than I expected it to be.  But I certainly ate it.  

I downed the ribs next, and loved those.  Finally, I polished off the chicken which really wowed me again.  I like to make beer can chicken at home, and this was every bit as good as homemade.  

Mac and cheese made the combo perfect.  I also got the grits, which I tasted and liked, but was too full to eat.  

Now, maybe I'm crowing about this barbecue because I come from an area not known for great barbecue.  But I get it now.  It really is better in the south than what we get back home.  

I don't know if I'll ever get back here, but I hope I do sometime."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Best ribs and beer can chicken. Hush puppies and beers were also great! I would highly recommend. Great service, price and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte! Very fun and lively atmosphere and a great place to grab a beer and some amazing, fall off the bone, ribs. The portions are huge too so it's super nice to have the next day for lunch! The best item on the menu is the pork belly with blackberry glaze. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Great restaurant and looking forward to the next opportunity to stop by."}
{"text":"Love this place! We eat it for lunch several times a week. Jennifer is by far the best waitress we've had there. The ribs are insane and the chicken is always so tender. Turkey wrap special is amazing."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant again since it opened this new location and just couldn't say I was on board 100%.  I don't care for the BBQ here...I just don't.  The meat to me, is way too smoky-now some may like this, so it's not necessarily a bad thing and I won't judge based off of that.  I'm not a fan of any of the sauces either, unfortunately.  I did enjoy the mac & cheese and the hush puppies.  They come with a sweet butter, which is heavenly.

The service was good.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with the menu.  There were beer specials and a variety of beer options.  

The layout of the restaurant was decent.  It had a large, open, comfortable feel."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great variety of beer. My only complaint which sadly will cause me not to return is the fact that I have to eat my meal off of brown paper. The juices from the pulled BBQ make the paper soggy which causes you to pick up now shredded paper along with your BBQ. I miss the days when plates were actually a thing. If you are getting a salad it's fine since they still use bowls however everything else is a no go."}
{"text":"Over all good experience . Waitress was nice and did not have to wait long for my food. I ordered the Spinach salad. Way to much Spinach for the little bit of toppings . You have to use a magnifying glass to find the bacon. Thinking I would see decent size chunks of bacon since it's a BBQ restaurant , was disappointing when it was more like tiny crumbles. Never tasted the bacon at all. 
Other than the bacon issue, the salad was over all ok and the hushpuppies were pretty good also"}
{"text":"Great place and the BBQ is always the best in town. Staff always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to the other two Mac's locations and they were both really good. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with the food here. The brisket was extremely dry and they water down their sauces. It's like they reheat their food in the microwave. This is a poor addition to the Mac's family."}
{"text":"Tasty food, cheap prices, fast & friendly service. Had a little pig sammy, a bud light tall boy (which I didn't drink but felt compelled to order it b/c everyone else at the restaurant had one and I'm a loser and succumbed to bandwagon peer pressure), and seriously the best hush-puppies ever! Being from SF, where there are no hush-puppies, I didn't quite get why it came with a side of whipped butter... what, you need to add more fat to deep fried cornmeal balls?!... but my local coworkers told me to shut my trap and just try them. I happily obliged and now am fatter b/c of it. (It was well worth it.) No wonder this place gets packed, especially at lunchtime. Atmosphere is kinda like a l'air du country-barn-rodeo genre; really don't get why they tout this as a biker bar, as it was neither bad-ass nor Harley-ish; nor did I even see bikes in the parking lot for that matter. 

I wonder if it's on purpose that all the servers are PYT girls in their 20s... eh, who cares, pass me some h-pups, those are my eye candy!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Enough beers to confuse the most experienced drinker. Wait staff was attentive and even replaced wings that were too hot for our kid.great menu"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here regularly because the staff is fun and the food is great. We recently had a friend visit and had taken him there. During his stay he wanted to go every night there for dinner.  I encourage you to try it."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!! The brisket, mac and cheese, hush puppies, fried pickles,"}
{"text":"Just moved in to town a few weeks ago and had been asking everyone where to get the best BBQ - most mentioned this place... Unfortunately, the only good thing about my visit was meeting up with some old friends and the draft beer. I ordered the sampler and most everything was over done / tough and not presented well. The search for great BBQ will continue..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! My friend brought me here for my birthday 2 years ago and since then, I have NEVER had a bad experience here. The service is so good. Our server, Shannon was so sweet and she even gave us some hushpuppies to go! Thanks for my next day afternoon snack, girl! 

My friend and I went around 8, but we were hoping to be eating by 8:30. We were literally finishing up our meal by 8:25. The food comes out SO quickly and it is delicious. The BBQ ribs just fall right off the bone. The wings were POPPING! Go there and ask for Shannon! 

5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"This relatively new addition to the NC scene (first restaurant in 2005)  is definitely of the barbecue emporium mold, offering a variety of smoked meats, and in copious amounts. There are now 5 locations, with the recent openings in Greenville and Fayetteville.

This is a sports bar,upscale biker bar, good friends and family all around kind of place - large screen TVs, lots of wood, a number of \"high\" tables, as well as more traditional, and more comfortable, booths. The row of parking slots directly in front of the restaurant are reserved for motorcycles.The waitresses efficiently scurry around in cutoff jeans, and food out of the kitchen is quick. I can see why these restaurants are so popular, there is something for everyone, and it all works.

Besides the smoked meats (pulled pork, brisket, wings, sausages, St Louis ribs, baby back ribs, and even smoked turkey), the menu includes sandwiches, burgers, a few salads, a few plates (like Shrimp & Grits, Fried Catfish), and a nice array of appetizers. And, of course, that have a large beer selection - bottled and on draught.

We came for the meat, of course, and settled on the Whole Lot Combo Platter ($28 with 4 meats & 4 sides). Our choices were Pulled Pork, Smoked Sausages, Beef Brisket, and St Louis Style Ribs. The sides included Collards, Green Bean Casserole, Onion Rings, and FFs.

Everything comes out piled on one platter (even the side dishes), which kind of makes for a train wreck, and tastes get mixed up, and some get lost - I wouldn't order a platter like this again - if I had wanted all the flavors merged I'd have ordered stew. Everything was at least pretty good, some items were excellent. 

The Pulled Pork was very, very good - nice smokiness, good overall flavor, though a touch dry out of the kitchen, some of the house sauce (there are 4 choices) helped this. Though I much prefer chopped pork rather than pulled ( it's a texture thing), the pork here is nice, and I'd definitely order it again.

The Beef Brisket had some nice flavor, but was more heavily sauced out of the kitchen than I care for, and it was far from the most tender brisket I've tried in the area. The Smoked Sausages were excellent - nice sharp smokey flavor, well cooked. The ribs were pretty good - tender, but over-sauced for my tastes.

The Collards were too sweet, and the Green Bean Casserole was buried under the ribs and brisket, and was soaked in 2 different sauces - not sure what the real taste was here. The Onion Rings were just outstanding - nice, fresh slices of sweet onion, hand cut, perfectly battered and fried. The FFs were nearly as good, and the complimentary Hush Puppies had a nice outside crust, but were a bit sweet.

All in all, an enjoyable, and very filling meal. This is not a traditional NC BBQ joint in any sense of the term - though the pork is excellent. I would definitely eat here again, if in the area - reordering the pork and the sausages - and I'd probably give the brisket another go, but unless it came out more tender, with some outside crust, that would be it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a drink with huband last night. This is a bar with a huge selection of beers. I decided to try the \"not your father's root beer\". It was good! The delicious smell of food was so tempting but we had just eaten at the new salad place Chopt in Park Road Shopping Center. It's great to have Macs near our house as there are not many good bars where you can just be comfortable and get a drink. Love it."}
{"text":"Nope. Isn't the south supposed to be known for bbq?? Went there for dinner with people from work. We got the nachos which were pretty good and the onion rings were ok. A couple people ordered the beer can chicken and liked it and a couple of us ordered the \"brisket\". So, when you order the brisket, they ask if you want fatty, lean, or both. I picked both. When it came to my table, I was dumbfounded. Thin, long pre-sliced pieces of dried out beef jerky looking pieces of meat with bbq sauce that looked \"lean\". I told the waitress i asked for both so she got me a new plate with the same sad, thin lean pieces of jerky. That's not brisket where I come from. Anyway, it comes with two sides and I picked a side salad which was a decent size and cheddar grits that looked liked creamed corn. However,they were nice enough to take my meal off the bill. I'm giving up on bbq until someone can show me succulent ribs, thick, meaty, fatty pieces of brisket and real grits. So for now, I'm done."}
{"text":"It was cool to sit outside on a warm day, but the service wasn't great, the place didn't seem very clean (at least when we were there), and the burger I ordered was okay at best. I noticed other reviewers mention the chicken and ribs. I might have ordered the wrong thing. I'm not sure if I will give it a second try because I really didn't feel happy about my decision to eat there when I left. On one hand, I'm curious about the chicken and ribs. On the other hand, it wasn't clean when we visited, so I might have to pass anyway. You can always find chicken and ribs elsewhere."}
{"text":"Edit:  Since this review they have updated the menu to remove the turkey as well as several other options in the combo platter.   They have also discontinued the fried apple pie.   Used to be a favorite place.   I doubt we will ever go back.  Old review:5. New review:2

Really good BBQ.  Had the combo platter with pulled pork, pulled turkey, ribs and brisket.  Portions were very nice for the price.  Especially the pork and turkey.   The brisket was ok. Nothing to write home about.   The ribs were fantastic. Nice pull. Great flavor.   The 4 sauces offered were very good although it would have been nice if they offered a sweet sauce.

All in all however the good was plentiful and had a great flavor.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Her casual style fit right in with the atmosphere of this BBQ joint.

As a final note, my wife would kill me if I did not mention the fried apple pie she had for dessert.  It was fantastic and a great end to the evening."}
{"text":"Very good bbq and friendly staff.  Crowded but they still got us food and drinks in reasonable time.  I recommend this place"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because Mac's has been my go-to place for BBQ in Charlotte since I have moved here.... We went in for a late lunch today and found that the menu changed two weeks ago.... The Switchback Salad was gone from the menu. It was hands- down the BEST salad in the area. I was so disappointed to see it removed. I did try the new spinach salad as a side with the beer can chicken. The flavors of the salad didn't work well together and the chicken was incredibly dry. Such a disappointment for a local favorite! It will be a while before I give it a try again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner last night. Started with the wings  in original sauce and they were excellent. Also had the hush puppies witch I would order again. Move on to dinner with pulled pork came with two sides of beans and green Bean casserole. Probably wouldn't come back for this plate. Also ordered some extra sides to try; Mac cheese, coleslaw, collard greens. The standout was the greens. 
Not sure I'd return. Food overall was fair and overpriced.

Service was good"}
{"text":"Went there for takeout last weekend. Ordered at the bar. Bartender was nice and giving the bar a serious wipe down which I always like to see :) Service for takeout was quick and friendly - they offered us a drink while we waited. They didn't give us any bbq sauce in our takeout bag which was a bummer, but nothing really needed it for our tastes - still I'm sure that would bother some people. Ok, so the food... meh? the chicken wings were the best thing we ordered. They were spicy (not buffalo) and smoked...REALLY good. The brisket... blech! sliced in thick, long blocks, versus thin strips and VERY dry. Worst brisket I've ever had. Not a fan of their coleslaw... bland. We got baby back and St. Louis style ribs as well. Both were good, but nothing memorable. The mac n cheese was super yummy! I'd give them another go sometime, but dine in so at least I could send that sorry brisket back to the kitchen and dare them to eat it!  Hope that helps!"}
{"text":"This is a solid spot. I've been to all of the Charlotte area locations multiple times and am always pleased. The food is consistent. The drink list is extensive. I feel like you can't go wrong here. 

My go to is the quarter beer can chicken. I get it \"naked\" and just mix all of the sauces at the table (which are awesome). For sides, I stick with mac and cheese and green bean casserole. I'm never able to finish it all and for $9, I think it's a great value. My boyfriend has had their catfish and their pulled pork and liked both. 

I don't think this is the BEST barbecue in town (my vote for that goes to, hands down, Midwood Smokehouse) but I think this is a great spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great barbeque with plenty of tv's for entertainment and beers FOR DAYS! Highly recommend the brisket tips!"}
{"text":"The service here was very good and the beer selection was on point. Extra points for having my favorite beer on draft (Birdsong's Doin' Thyme). I had the pulled pork nachos and my boyfriend had the pulled pork platter with mac n cheese and potato salad. 

The nachos were decent- very good chips and the pork was delicious. I'm very particular about having the cheese well spread out and melted on all of the chips and everything was just kind of dumped in the middle. It still tasted good and I made it work by filling the empty outer chips into the middle, but I thought they could have done a better job. Nachos are easy! 

The pulled pork was very good. Macs has great sauces to put on their barbecue but honestly it is very flavorful and doesn't really need it. The baked potato salad was delicious and the mac n cheese was pretty nice also. 

Overall, we had quick service and decent food. I wasn't wowed, but Mac's is always a good staple."}
{"text":"I visited mac's in steele creek and had a wonderful experience, it's a speed shop so it's quick and they have a lot to choose from. The mac and cheese was particularly my favorite.  They bring you hushpuppies with bacon honey butter sent from heaven! Our server Kaylin was very sweet and made sure i had everything i needed and even gave me a free coozie. I'm a huge fan of PBR and they have it on tap very cheap. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had this catered to my office and it was delicious.  Large portions and the sides were out of this world.  We had the Barbeque and smoked wings for our meat and both were great!  The award for the best side goes to the green bean casserole. The mac and cheese was also delicious.  The order was delivered a little early which was problematic because we had told everyone a specific time. It had to sit 15 minutes before it was served."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the BBQ is always good to great for the money. The service is hit or miss though. Runners bring the food out so if you want/need another beer/drink then you have to flag down your server... if you can. Lots to choose from on the menu and yummie desserts will bring me/us back."}
{"text":"Mac's Speed Shop is my go-to for BBQ in Charlotte. Mac's has a laid-back vibe and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (if you sit outside you can even bring your pup)! Mac's often has live music, which further adds to why I love this place.

Once you sit down, your waitress will bring out warm hush puppies with butter. These hush puppies are so delicious! I have tried many things here - from the BBQ sandwich, to the brisket, to the Thunderbird salad ... they have so many yummy options. The brisket is a personal favorite as it's moist and full of flavor. You can't forget the sides - from the baked beans to the mac and cheese, I haven't had a side I didn't love.

Mac's is located in the heart of South End Charlotte. This is a great place for a bigger group, and a great place to take family or friends who are visiting Charlotte. I love to sit out on their patio and grab a beer on a warm summer night!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the positives, our server was good, that is once she finally came over and waited on us. She took our order in a timely fashion which I liked but she did get my step daughters order wrong which is not a huge deal because she ate what she was given anyway. However I found it strange that our food came out so quickly. For a BBQ place that wings are \"smoked\" they were chewy and the flavor just wasn't there. My husband got the pulled pork so we could share the two and honestly I could not have been more disappointed. The Mac and cheese was pretty much water. We were literally so disappointed we had to get BBQ somewhere else the next day because we were just not satisfied and let me tell you this place was authentic ribs had a nice char on them and the wings were smoked to perfection. Needless to say I will never be returning to Macs when I'm craving BBQ."}
{"text":"This is a weird review.....Mac's has always been a good time with great food whenever I visit. Nice spot to meet a bud for a brew after work and the BBQ has been consistent .
Sadly, Mac's \"to go\" is two time loser. It's almost like their serving from a different place. Tried it once and though I was just getting the bottom of the barrel. Second time, it was confirmed that \"to go\" orders are second fiddle.
Three stars for the good ole times, but we'll drive past next time we want good bbq at home"}
{"text":"Went to this place as a recommendation and it was total crap.  Ordered burgers Med, got blood rare.  Requested replacement, took over 25 minutes until we told them never mind.  My brother got the BBQ and it was dry as all heck.  Being in the south, there is so much BBQ and this place doesn't hit the mark.  I recommend you look elsewhere for BBQ in Queen's City."}
{"text":"No Jive Turkey here!  (Actually, I just found out that Mac's now serves an open-faced turkey sandwich, sans the gravy).  

Went here w/ some out-of-town friends and their kids as they passed thru the CLT heading north on ye olde I-77.

Atmosphere - Sunday afternoon busy, noisy, entertaining.

Service - The girl at the front was great!  I arrived before my friends did and asked if there was a booth available.  She worked to get me one before they arrived and was completely pleasant about meeting our needs...even gave the kids the coloring sheets and crayons.  The waitress was good, although she was a little slower on the refills than I normally like...but they were busy.

Food - I had the open-faced turkey sandwich and onion rings.  FYI - the hush puppies, while smaller now, come free w/ your meal.  The food arrived hot and my meal consisted of two slices of Texas toast w/ a large portion of white meat turkey along w/ the tasty onion rings, side sauce, and Hopping John's (beans and rice).  The turkey, while a little dry was easily moistened with the four sauces that Mac's now carry.  The onion rings were great as normal and the Hopping John's was decent.  One observation that my friend's wife and I made was that the side sauce that comes with the o-rings tastes like Mad's signature sauce but it is thicker and more appetizing.  Next time I go, I will be placing this sauce on my pork sandwich!  

Price - $10 Turkey Plate.  Great value for the amount of turkey I received.

Overall - I had a nice experience that keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Really really good. First time eating here and I can highly recommend this place. Try the wings and the brisket. True Carolina bar b que!"}
{"text":"First time to Mac's and I'm not a big meat eater, but we thought everything was good and a great value. I had a three veggie plate and we also had catfish taco, ribs, brisket, quesadilla, and huge chips and salsa with guacamole and queso. Everything was good with sizable portions. They were busy and very loud, but service was fine with no long waits."}
{"text":"I only had the chance to sample the pulled pork.  Service was prompt and the food was very good.  Our drinks were constantly re-filled.  I liked the pulled pork but it looks like everyone is into the ribs so I'll have to try that some time."}
{"text":"Worst Father's day lunch ever.

The good was great. Right up until my wife got a bone in her BBQ.

The service was unacceptable. A party of seven and it took for EVER to get served. 2 plates came out. Then a loooong wait. 4 more. Close but still waiting on the last meal. 

Not my first visit to Mac's but it will be a long time till we come back. Kitchen staff: 
Get your act together!

#missFinzAlready"}
{"text":"I'm picky about BBQ but this place is one of the best I've been to in a long time. This place has a \"biker theme' but you're more likely to see middle aged businessmen than actual bikers here. The service is very friendly and they have an excellent beer selection. They even had a guy from a local brewery giving out samples of bourbon aged beer. 

As for the food, the Tabasco fried pickles are about the best I've had anywhere. They've got a spicy flavor without being too heavily breaded. The pickle chips were thin and weren't greasy at all, in fact we ended up ordering a second basket. As great as the pickles were, they beef rib was even better. The beef rib took up most of my plate and was something out of the old Flintstones cartoon. This thing was tender, well cooked, and I could barely finish all of it (and I was starving.) The green bean casserole and BBQ beans were both excellent as well but I was too full to eat too much of them.The Texas toast is pretty good as well but I was too stuffed to eat much of it. The sweet tea was worthy of ordering as well. 

This place is a must try in Charlotte and I'll be back here if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The visit here was okay. Service was terrible, point blank. The food was so so, very sub par compared to other locations I've been to. Tons of craft beer on tap and good specials, but took so long to get a beer that it was hard to enjoy them!"}
{"text":"I ordered online got the combo with chicken sausage brisket and ribs picked it up everyone was nice got home ate the food and it was absolutely disgusting ribs were burnt chicken was underdone brisket tasted like old burnt steak only think that was good was the sausage was very pissed off after spending 36 dollars and getting shit will never go there again in my life and I do not think anyone should go there and this was my first and last time going there the cook needs to be fired"}
{"text":"We always have to come here when we visit Charlotte. The beef rib is the best. The brisket is also pretty good. The hush puppies - wow. Omg. I can literally eat all everyday! Minor issue with hair in my baked beans but the waitress quickly brought out another. Great food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Mac's on Saturday with Becky and a friend. I like Mac's on South and I've only been to the one in LKN once (didn't quite like that one). Love the beer selection, I mean, they have shit that you can't really get many other places in town. Overall, Mac's is a good choice. This one though... definitely doesn't feel like a biker bar.

On the day we went, the second we walked in we were nearly deafened by the crappy cover band they had playing inside the damned thing. I mean... the place inside just isn't built to accommodate a full blown, totally plugged in, loud as hell, local bar, cover band. We had a really hard time hearing each other and to scream over the music even though we sat as far away as possible from them. This was juts a poor booking decision.

Our server was really nice and helpful. She came around fairly often to check on us and offer more beer (always a plus). The food came out fast and hot and everything was great. Ordered the BBQ plate (with Eastern Carolina BBQ, the only way to eat BBQ) with onion rings and the green bean casserole. The green been casserole was odd, It was good, but it tasted and had a nice heat to it, like Jalapeño peppers had been used. Took some getting used to... still not sure if I liked it.

Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Blackened Fish Sandwich with a side of collard greens is my new favorite dish. They always have the local brews on tap."}
{"text":"Macs - for me you are a BBQ Staple. You've got the atmosphere, beer, sports and more importantly the food! I've never had a bad experience at any of your restaurants. Visited this Matthews location recently with my family (8 of us) and it was great. 
Smoked wings were tender fresh and delicious
Brisket was fatty and lean as per my request and again fresh and juicy.
Mac n cheese was great as per
Sweet tater fries were ok (y'all never seem to be able to bring them hot)
Hush puppies were awesome!

Beers great

You guys seem to be tagged with a lower end stick but in my opinion you're up there with the best around!"}
{"text":"Overall, Mac's is a pretty good BBQ restaurant. I think Midwood Smokehouse is better, but I still like Mac's. I like that they have 4-6 different sauces on the table so that you can pick whichever you like best. I usually get their pulled pork sandwich/plate or the pulled turkey plate. Both are pretty good. My favorite sides are the mac and cheese and green bean casserole. You also get free hush puppies as an appetizer, but you have to ask for them. Parking is kind of a pain. The lot is pretty small and almost always full. I've had to park across the street and risk getting a ticket"}
{"text":"Love macs! Great BBQ, staff and environment. I recommend the pulled pork plate. It's more than enough food so you will be leaving full, for sure! Mac and cheese is good, salad is good, and OF COURSE good BBQ."}
{"text":"Food was very good and came out quick. I'm not a fan of vinegar based bbq sauce but the one called red sauce was tangy and spicy so it was okay. Bbq beans were tasty and the pulled pork was tender.  $4 for a 25 oz beer was a nice surprise.   Hubby really enjoyed his side of chili with all the fixings. 
We would definitely come back.  Just a little noisy & lots of families with small children. Not a biker place...."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Macs. I was very impressed the first time, but not so much today. I ordered the Brisket Quesadillas. Although they were tasty, I felt that for the cost, the portions were small. Additionally, it took our waitress almost 15 minutes to take our food order. Overall, the atmosphere is great and I will be back, but during lunch hour, I'll probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere accompanied with friendly staff and great service. Came in with family and the place was busy with good mix of ages, live music and sports screens everywhere. I'd definitely go back! Excellent choice of beers!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ in Charlotte, hands down. I bring all of my out of town visitors here. The BBQ chicken nachos are a must (add the Red Sauce to make it perfect). The service and the vibe are awesome as well. I. Love. This. Place."}
{"text":"Overrated BBQ. Very pricey for what you get. Nice service but I don't see what the big deal is."}
{"text":"I'm a TX gal so it's pretty blasphemous for me to say that I like Carolina BBQ, but I've always loved vinegar-based sauces. This was my first real foray into Carolina BBQ so I can't really compare or say that much, but this place has good food. I tried the burnt ends (yum) and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the mac & cheese. It was relatively cheap and quick, and I loved trying the different sauces (there's like 5-6 different sauces to choose from). The mac and cheese was just okay to me (a little bland).

There's a pretty large parking lot here which is a plus, but we did come here around 1 PM on a Saturday which is a bit late. I didn't try any of the beers either, so I'll have to do that next time."}
{"text":"The food quality is great but it's a shame that some meats are underseasoned. The pulled pork, ribs, and the brisket had the smokey flavors but definitely needed some salt. The food comes very quickly so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ spot in Charlotte.  Love the collard greens, one of my favorites.  The food is always good, and the service much better this time.  Our server was very tentative and pleasant--our food came out fast, and piping hot.  I usually go with their brisket or pulled pork--tonight was the brisket. My baby had the fried catfish, with Brunswick stew and the Mac-n-cheese.  Fish was fired to perfection, and portions are big, she always ends up with a doggy bag.  Been traveling quite a bit lately so had to stop for my Macs fix."}
{"text":"Awesome food and selection. Glad they finally opened in Matthews. Had the smoked chicken wings and wife loved the pulled pork taco. Cant wait to go back and try other items from the menu. It's not just a BBQ joint. They have a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Great spot to take a friend, first date or family. BBQ is bomb, service is what you would expect for a 'biker' bar but fairly attentive.
Honestly one of my favorite spots to frequent due to atmosphere, food and selection of beers. 
Shine on you crazy sauce covered diamond in the rough, shine on."}
{"text":"The best bbq in town! From California...Cali needs to take notes on how to bbq their meat. Lindsey is the best server, the sweetest! Go here if you want good food & great vibes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Never gotten a meal here I didn't like. 

I recommend the brisket, my favorite. Sweet potato fries are on point too. 

It's a little loud around lunch so be prepared.  But if you are looking for a fast option with great food and good service, it doesn't get better than Macs."}
{"text":"Checked out the \"best BBQ place\" on Google and I gotta say, this place is on point! I got the ribs, they were tender and a little bit sweet surprisingly. Which I didn't mind. Ended up trading the mac & cheese for green bean casserole. My favorite thing was they played old 90s Rock music; Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Metallica and The Offspring. I'm sold on this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Hubby got the catfish po' boy. He was pleasantly surprised with how delicious it was & how large the filet of catfish was. I had pulled pork with Carolina BBQ sauce. It was really good. The mac & cheese let me down a bit. It was a little dry- which may have been because we got there pretty late... I definitely plan on returning here soon"}
{"text":"Good Meats here. For a local chair restaurant with a biker attitude this place is great! 
Drinks are well made, beer selection is good and the atmospheres original. 

Kids like it too, other than a loud chopper starting up. But it's a cool, bbq/bicker/sports bar restaurant. 
Great service too"}
{"text":"You haven't lived until you have smoked wings at Mac's!

A friend suggested we meet up with the families for a non traditional Sunday dinner. The atmosphere is biker-ish and energetic. 

Megan was our server. Hands down, the best ever. We had three pre-teen/teen boys with us and her daytime teacher role kicked in and she catered to them. She even set up a separate table for them so that we could have adult conversations. She was very complimentary of their behavior. Our glasses were never empty because she was so attentive. Megan rocked. 

Sweet hush puppies kick off the Mac's experience. But don't fill up on them because your plates will have a massive amount of food. 

I had heard about their smoked wings and decided to try them tonight for myself. They are WONDERFUL! The smoky flavor comes through despite what sauce you choose. I had dry rub and TPX chipotle. If you like a little heat, I would suggest this combo. With eight wings, you can pick two different sauces. 

If you want sides, the \"three car side\" is the way to go. Tonight I chose macaroni and cheese, collard greens and sweet potato fries ($1 extra FYI). All of my sides were tasty. I would probably choose something other than the collards next time. Maybe it was the type of vinegar, but they had a sweetness that I wasn't fond of as I like greens to be a tad \"bitter\". 

I couldn't finish everything so when Megan asked what dessert we'd like, we almost ended our new friendship!

Awesome food. Fun atmosphere. Superb service."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything about this place ! Great food and we happened to go on a day (Monday) when every draft on tap was only $3!"}
{"text":"Great place! Waitress was awesome recommending a great IPA. Hush puppies and o rings to start, mixed with different sauces they offer - yum!

Main course of beef rib and coleslaw - delectable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible place. First the parking was way too tight. The service was terrible. The appetizer was brought out with the food and our food was cold. We requested the manager and she was a complete b**ch. she was racist towards me And my family because we are not Caucasian. The servers were racist as well on a count of we were the only table receiving bad service. I'm NEVER coming back here again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed great catfish & the beer selection is perfect. Lots of great drafts for any taste buds & you can purchase beer to go."}
{"text":"I am visiting family in Charlotte and since I'm from Northern VA I figured I'd try the BBQ. Mac's was the closest place to where I was staying. 

I got the Little Bit of Stuff Platter with the pulled pork, brisket, chicken, and ribs. Everything was great. Chicken was moist and delicious but my favorite was the brisket and ribs. They were very flavorful! I also got the mac and cheese and green bean casserole, those were both good but nothing I'd dream about. 

Overall visit was good, service was OK. My rating is mostly based on the food."}
{"text":"Good barbecue. Great atmosphere if you want to hang out with the Harley crowd that drives them 3 miles from their 500K+ homes up the road to Mac's to showboat on Saturdays after a trip to Lake Norman... which is aight you know. Laid back to watch a football game. If you're into that sorta thing. I like the quesadillas too."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was good.   I can't say I cared for the pulled pork much but the cheese grits were awesome.
My fiends enjoyed their burgers."}
{"text":"I LOVE BBQ; however, I'm not a huge fan. It's just okay. I've tried BBQ from TX, TN, GA, and even here in NC. I was actually slightly disappointed because there were so many great reviews via Yelp. 

I'm fairly new to the city so I've been longing for a great BBQ place. I think I'll stick with Sticky Fingers for a good BBQ plate. The service wasn't great. To be frank there seemed to be \"usual customers\" whom received the ultimate service. Meanwhile, I was just tolerated because I was patronizing. Not a fan and I'd hate to call it discrimination; however, I observed the waiter's reaction to others.... Completely different.

{"text":"I went here for the first time this weekend and enjoyed myself. I got the smoked chicken wings with three sides. I loved the wings and cheese grits. I did not like the Brunswick stew, which was disappointing since I was really looking forward to it. The seats are not cushioned anywhere in the entire place so it was uncomfortable to stay long."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and basically waddled out of here. It was awesome. The fried pickles are delicious- lightly breaded and you could tell they were made to order. I got the St. Louis Ribs with Mac n' cheese and onion rings. There was nothing left on my plate. 
The waitress was fantastic. It was $3 pints and she kept them coming. I've heard the brunch was pretty good- if it's anything like the dinner I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mac's a number of times and it's always great. Large selection of beers, lots of TV's on the walls and a really great menu of barbecue.

Mrs. and I stopped in this time and I chose the pulled pork with mac & cheese and cole slaw. A good portion though maybe a little high in the salt. Tasty and moist. Mac and cheese was okay, cole slaw was crunchy and the celery seeds made for a good flavor.

Mrs. chose the half rack of ribs which she enjoyed and I managed to sneak one away from her. Tender, fall off the bone, delicious."}
{"text":"Enticed by The Wing Dings on the menu, I visited this location.  They have a number of booths but they fit only four. With five in my party, I would not sit a young 5-year old  on a bar stool!  

Service was great and the staff were friendly and accommodating.  I ended up with a veggie plate with mac & cheese...I had to try it, collard greens and potato salad.  The mac & cheese was pretty good, as were the greens with a bit of heat on them.  The kids enjoyed a chicken finger plate (two fingers) and a bbq sandwich which they nibbled on, having had a heavy snack before we arrived.  The others in my party enjoyed the blackened talapia sandwich with heat on it as well and it looked as good as it tasted.  The warm chocolate brownie with ice cream topped off the meal, but the brownie was on the cool side.  

We arrived around 6 pm but the atmosphere was more of an after-work, stop in for a drink environment.  Overall, my first visit to this location was not bad and I look forward to visiting the South Boulevard location."}
{"text":"I made a special stop at Mac's on my way back to ATL. This place is absolutely the real deal!"}
{"text":"The boodle and I decided to get BBQ after our yoga session at D9. We saw there was a Mac's up in Cornelius and decided that would be our spot! We walked in and were immediately seated. We sat outside, which was great! There's not a lot of lighting outside; as it got darker, it was a little hard to see the menu.

The boodle (that's my husband) ordered a beer, which they were out of. He proceeded to order three more bees that they were also out of. I totally get being out of something, but I felt like this was a little excessive. Our server was extremely nice and comped the beer because of all the back and forth trying to find something in stock.

My BBQ had great flavor, but it wasn't very warm when I got it (my only complaint). The mac and cheese was delicious, but also semi-warm. I am definitely willing to get Mac's another shot and plan to go back. 

I will note there is plenty of parking at this location."}

Whenever I visit the Carolinas (which is where I grew up), I am always seeking out Carolina BBQ since I can't get that in the Pacific NW. I had flown into Charlotte with the family to visit inlaws, and we were in the mood for something good for dinner. I of course wanted BBQ, and after doing some searching landed on Mac's Speed Shop. It looked like an interesting place so we decided to check it out. We were a bit hesitant at first arrival given that the restaurant has a really interesting biker bar theme to it. The hostess assured me that the restaurant was family friendly, complete with kids menus, so we decided to dine in.

Besides the biker bar theme throughout, the most noticeable thing was the delicious BBQ smells attacking my olfactory senses. Everything I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing, and we couldn't wait to order our food. We started with an order of fried pickles, the perfect appetizer when in the south. The pickles were served as chips, had a nice crispy batter with a great flavor, and the dipping sauce was perfect. The basket we ordered didn't last long.

There are quite a few BBQ options, including beef or pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and turkey, as well as southern style catfish and shrimp. They also serve burgers and a variety of sandwiches. One of the options is a combo platter where you get to choose 4 meats, and you get can order \"A Little Bit of Stuff\" or a \"A Whole Lot of Stuff\", the difference being $10 and a lot more meat in the second option. This sounded like a good option for 2 adults to share, and after some deliberation we chose brisket, pulled pork, pulled turkey, and pork ribs. We also got to choose 4 sides and went with BBQ beans, mac and cheese, collard greens, and green bean casserole. Everything was delicious. The meats were all very tender, with nice smoke rings and a smoky flavor. I was especially a big fan of the brisket and ribs, though the pork and turkey were quite good as well. All 4 sides were also very well done, though the mac and cheese and collards were definitely the favorites. 

The kids meals were a good size and enjoyed by all. My son ordered a BBQ chicken sammie with a side of mac and cheese, and it was also quite good. The kids were catered to quite a bit actually and really enjoyed the experience. 

We really didn't have room for dessert, but southern style banana pudding is just too hard for me to pass up. We also ordered a brownie ala mode which was shared by multiple people. I didn't personally try the brownie (though it got thumbs up from everyone who did), but the banana pudding was amazing. It was definitely true Southern style, with a rich creamy pudding completed by the crunchy texture of the Nilla wafers. It was a perfect ending to the meal, and we were quite full!

There is quite a bit of seating throughout the restaurant, which is good considering how crowded it gets. Despite the large bar and overall biker bar atmosphere, there were a large number of families there. The restaurant was definitely noisy but had a fun atmosphere. Our waitress was great and provided amazing service, including making doubly sure that the kids were enjoying themselves. The prices were very good, especially considering both the quantity and quality. I definitely plan on visiting again in the future when I am back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ugh! We frequent the Mac's on South Blvd and it is consistently fresh due to the high volume. The one in Cornelius I had a problem with old food last time friends took me there for lunch but still went tonight for a quick bite per my husbands request. 
What a mistake. Never again! Started with hostess with long med blind straight hair and a miserable look in her face. No hello just \"How many? Booth or high top?\" We said \"booth\" then she tried to seat us at hightop then got a look if disgust when I said that we had said booth.ee then ordered wings that were grilled. They had grill marks on shiny rubbery fatty wings. I bit into one and pink juice came through, not cooked through.  I ordered Baha salad and smoked turkey on top. Bit into the salad and something tasted off so I tried my fork in the dressing and it was spoiled!! The turkey on top was dried and petrified. Called the server over and when I told her about the spoiled ranch Baha dresssing she looked at me like I wouldn't know the difference. The manager came out and said I could have something else-no way thanks. Hope I don't get food poisoning tonight!
My husbands green bean casserole was a week old and he left it and his ribs were tiny and all bones. What a disaster."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Matthews, decent food and service but a great beer selection makes up for that. Very nice new building but very crowded and has a bit of a parking problem."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food.  Great beer selection.  Awesome sides.  Service from Shannon at the bar puts everything else to shame though.  Her level of customer service is insane, felt like family.  Thank you Shannon!!!!"}
{"text":"Just wow!  Probably the best barbeque I've ever eaten.  Love all of the sauce choices and the perfect level of smokiness in the meats.  The hog wings, brisket, and ribs are all devine.  The creamed corn is absolute heaven.  Mac and cheese, onion rings, and green bean casserole were all great as well.  The catfish and shrimp tacos were out of this world.  Oh, and then there's the beer selection... This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Our bartender, Allie (sp?) was also delightful. Will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Macs has proven to be one of my tougher reviews. There's a lot to like about it and a bit to not like about it. My mixed experience there makes for quite a mixed review.

The miss' and I went for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:00pm. It was not busy and we were greeted and sat immediately. The waitress came over soon after and asked what we wanted to drink, but there were no beer lists on the table, so we had to wait for her to find some and bring them over. Why there just wasn't one on each table is beyond me. Anywho, once I had the beer list in my hands I was blown away. I would guestimate that Mac's keeps over 100 different beers on hand, be they draft, bottle or can. The vast selection of beer was definitely a huge plus and something that would definitely bring me back.

After taking our orders the waitress dropped off the complimentary hush puppies. They were pretty darn good...firm, sweet, and not too doughy. For an appetizer we split an order of a half dozen wings ($4.50) in honey BBQ sauce. The wings are grilled, not fried, and having that smokey, char taste and texture to them worked wonders in my mouth. I fell in love with these meaty wings and I would highly recommend them as a nice, light appetizer. 

Then came the dinners. The miss' went with the beer can chicken ($9.00) and it was very good. The chicken was juicy and not dried out...simple yet very effective. Being a BBQ fanatic I wanted to try as many of their things as I could to see what they did best, so I ordered the \"A Little Bit of It All\" combo platter. It's a custom platter where you select four meats and two sides. I went with the smoked turkey, ribs, brisket and sausage. Right off the bat I have to say that the ribs and brisket were cold like they had been sitting on a counter for quite some time. This was a huge turn-off for me, particularly with the brisket. The brisket was a nice, juicy cut of meat and was mighty tender, but I think the low temperature made it tougher than it normally would have been. Also, cold meat tastes a lot different than hot meat so that was another strike against the brisket. The ribs were also not piping hot when receiving them, but they turned out better than the brisket. They were fall off the bone tender but had quite a bit of meat on them, and it tore off in nice, satisfying hunks.

 The sausage was not what I expected. I'm pretty sure it was a beef sausage as opposed to the pork sausage I'm used to getting at BBQ joints. Also, it was a leaner sausage than I was used to, so it was a strong beefy, tough, dry bit of meat. This wasn't a bad thing though, as it was also crisp and spicy, and all these things together made for a pretty good sausage. Then came the smoked turkey. This thing knocked my socks off! I didn't know what to expect...part of me kind of thought it would be just slices of turkey breast that were smoked, while the other part hoped for something more. It did indeed end up being something more, and I never thought I would say this but the turkey was the best meat at this BBQ joint. It was indeed smoked but it's shredded/pulled and has just a bit of sauce on it. It's simple yet delectable, and it was one heck of a moist smoked meat (no nasty dry white meat turkey). It kind of reminded me of those giant awesome turkey legs you get at Disney World and other fairs/ events. It was totally awesome and by far the best turkey I have ever eaten out (and probably better than the turkey I had at Thanksgiving, but don't tell my mom that.)

Next thing to talk about are the sides. My wife and I both had the mac & cheese and we were both disappointed with it. The mac portion was slimy and super soft like it was cooked for hours in the boiling water. The cheese part was practically non-existent as there was very little flavor to it. My other side choice was the potato salad which not bad yet nothing amazing. 

The last thing I need to talk about is the BBQ sauce. I'm from New York, so the BBQ sauce I am used to is thick and sweet. Now I'm not bashing Carolina BBQ, but I am just not a fan (yet) of the watery vinegar-based sauces with a bite that are down here. I'm 110%  certain that over time I will acquire a taste for them and will eventually be poo-pooing the overly sweet, rich sauces but I just couldn't help thinking how different the food would have been with a thicker sauce on it. 

So Mac's does some things good. An awesome beer selection, great smoked turkey and grilled wings, and decent ribs and brisket (though best brisket so far still goes to Lancasters.) I didn't mind the \"biker bar\" type theme, but I didn't go there for it either. I was a bit disappointed with the cold food, side choices and the sauce. Would I come back? Yes I would, but only after I have tried several other BBQ joints in the area first."}
{"text":"Great tender bar b q with traditional thin sauces.  Service was quick and food was quicker. Server recommended the small sampler and she was right.  Tim of food for the money. The ribs were fall off the bone, while the chicken was moist.  Coleslaw was vinegar style but layered on my pulled pork was the topper to bring the meal home."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch. Great food. Pork & collards are great. I'll order those again. Service was fast & staff was friendly & knowledgeable. This was my first time & they didn't steer me wrong. Wonderful beer selection"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte NC, i was here for work and had Just got in after a long day and a rough flight. I went on the recommendation of the hotel clerk and was he ever right. Excellent food if your into BBQ, Burgers, and Hard Rock. Friendly staff and fair prices. Exactly what I was looking for and not to mention an extensive craft beer tap list, and I mean extensive, like really extensive and rare. Would highly recommend to the motorcycle and beer enthusiasts out there."}
{"text":"After a 5 hour flight delay, I needed to eat dinner before crashing for the night.  Luckily, Mac's is open late and on the way from the airport and to my hotel.  I sat at the bar because they were closing (it was 11:30) and ordered the pulled pork with 2 sides; mac and cheese and cheese grits.  The pork was ok, very dry and not a lot of flavor until I added additional BBQ sauce on it, i'm not sure if that was because it was so late but I was disappointed since I was craving Carolina pulled pork.  The mac and cheese was good but the highlight of the meal was the cheese grits.  I'd like to come back and give this place another shot but with so many other options I'm not sure I will."}
{"text":"Great for groups, they were very accommodating, fantastic hospitality, and delicious food. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Worst ribs ever. They were smothered in too much sauce I guess to cover up how dry the meat was. There was very little meat on the bone. Very disappointed. Tasted 4 days old."}
{"text":"Overall Mac's is good, not great. The atmosphere is very chill and fun to be around. The menu has ballooned beyond a traditional bbq place so there are tons of bbq inspired options. Flavor on most meats and hamburgers are great. I'd say overall the portion sizes are slightly smaller than you would expect for the prices you can pay for dishes."}
{"text":"The South Blvd shop is actually closer to the office, but this location is marginally less crowded. Not as hip as the original location, but still on par. 

Lunch time at Macs can be something like the Vans Warped Tour or a Slipknot concert. You have to throw elbows and fight your way through the mosh pit. My advice to you - call in that bad boy. 

Pork is spotty and sometimes dry, but a little sauce can help out immensely. Ribs are always good though and blackened catfish tacos are pretty decent for un fried tacos. (Can you sense the fish taco purist in me?) 

While I like different BBQ joints depending on my mood, one thing that never changes is my perpetual, unconditional love for Mac's sides. Mac and cheese is always good and the green been casserole, oh man. Thanksgiving on a Monday! Yeeeah!"}
{"text":"The wings here are great.  I have had them once, but I know people who only order wings now, after the initial taste.  It's worth a shot.  I like variety too much to do that.

I went yesterday and had the beef rib.  It was fall off the bone style, with some tasty bbq slathered on.  I topped it off with some hush puppies, for a very hearty meal.

I've had tacos on a previous visit, and they are also very tasty.  I strongly recommend the brownie a la mode if you have room.  I rarely eat dessert, but I just had a bite of someone's and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our time eating dinner. Group of 5, it was a slower night at the restaurant but our server Amanda was great and provided excellent service. We had the deviled eggs as an appetizer along with the hush puppies that came out hot and fresh. Had the \"little bit of everything\" (ribs, brisket and pulled pork) along with the Mac and cheese/cream of corn for our sides. All of the food was extremely tasty. The only semi negative would be the ribs were tough trying to take them off the bone, didn't affect the taste. Really had a positive experience and would come back at the next opportunity"}
{"text":"The place was nice and food was pretty good. I had the the baby back rib appetizer but didn't care for the spice rub that must have been used. My wife got the pulled pork and we ended up trading meals. The pulled pork was really good and she enjoyed the ribs. The Mac and Cheese that came with ribs was very good. The server was really good and service over all was good. Nothing was exceptional but everything was ok."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much of their menu yet. I've been twice, and both times I got the large pulled pork BBQ platter, with baked beans and french fries. Wow! That is some good BBQ. I like the BBQ to be lean, without a lot of fat in it and my experience here has been excellent. My wife has gotten the ribs both times and she loves them also. Mac's has a large craft beer selection, both on draft and in bottles. They had a Wicked Weed Gluten free double IPA on draft that was very good. They have a full bar for those that don't like beer. The atmosphere inside is a lot like Hickory Tavern with some high top tables, and regular tables, a good many TV's with sports running. The service was fast and friendly. They have a large outdoor seating area that tends to be well used. I've not tried that yet. Overall, a great place to come have some BBQ, drink a beer, and watch a game."}
{"text":"Oh man, best barbecue I've had in a while! I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and an order of fried pickles--yum! On the pulled pork sandwich, you get this wonderfully crunchy cole slaw that's got just the right amount of dressing in it; no soggy buns unless you want it that way. My favorite sauces were the SC Mustard Sauce and the Red BBQ Sauce, but they were all very good. 

I didn't try any of the beer, but the bar had a good tap list going with plenty of craft beer to choose from. The beer swag was from all over, and included local NC-breweries, so that's a plus. (Support your local beer scene!) There also appeared to be memberships of some sort available and some football on several big screens. If you're a sports fan, this would be a good place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Wine half-price on tuesday. Good thing, cuz i needed that wine to help dissolve the large chunks of kansas city beef rib in my gut! What is it about smoked beef fat? Irresistible to dogs like me. Nice, clean bone about 12 inches long with a skillet of tender meat at the end. By skillet, i mean 12 inches in diameter and two inches thick! Shared with the super carnivore and we still had half of it left. Never seen this cut before and it's a good thing i haven't.... We visited mac's twice in one week, tuesday, natch. Each meal featured that excellent meat.
Mac's sides don't do me like the rib, but they're good enough. Potato salad was a solid choice, i forget my other. 
Service was attentive.
I like the mac's vibe, motorcycle theme, with booze and meat. Very popular, good for all the age groups."}
{"text":"So I'm a fan of the Mac's South Blvd location (original) so I had high hopes coming into the Steel Creek location.  Totally different feel... there's an actual, \"proper\" parking lot, but it is definitely not the same.

Went on a work night with a couple buddies and dinner and had a good time.  Started out with brews (which they do have a nice tap selection) and then ordered food.  Seems like the portions were smaller here, but there was no shortage of friendliness with our server.  Just a well oiled machine of cranking out BBQ.

Similar setup on the inside.... large bar to the right and movable high top tables in the center.  Oh yeah, this location had booths that flanked against the windows.  I think South blvd only had a few booths.

Since it was January and cold, I didn't see much of a patio, but it was partially covered (also where people were smoking).  Not as big of a patio from the original location, but it is good to note that it has one.

I'd probably go back if I find myself in the area, but I'll stick to my go-to South Blvd location for now."}
{"text":"Mac's? What happened? Your food used to be consistently good from the Fried Pickles to the Mac n Cheese. But my recent visit I cam away quite disappointed.

I came here with a group from work and we were seated outside at the only complete shaded table on the side of the building. Loved the table. There were even barely moving ceiing fans above that did nothing to keep you cool in the heat.

We started with two orders of fried pickles which took forever to come out. In past visits, they usually came out immediately event when you were busy.  I also remember these as being crispy and spicy but they were soggy and most of the coating was falling off. Not a good start to this lunch.

For a meal, I ordered the beer can chicken with onion rings and mac n cheese.  The chicken was smoked well but was also quite fatty. I remember the mac n cheese being really good but what i received was cafeteria quality with overcooked pasta and flavorless cheese. The onion rings were a bit too crispy.

I'm not sure what happened Mac's. Your food just isn't as good as it used to be. The best thing about this visit was our server but even she couldn't save this from being a 2-star review."}
{"text":"Happy New Year!  Seriously Happy 2017. We have always loved Mac's!  I had been very disappointed with the food in the last year, we decided to come have our traditional New Years fare to watch football and enjoy great beer. I'm absolutely ecstatic to say the food is back to superb. The pulled pork was the best thing I've ever put into my mouth, I'm from a big barbq town so that says a lot, the greens have been upgraded (if that's possible)and the black-eyed peas were spot on. I'm so excited that we can once again enjoy this great establishment for more than great wings and beer selection. Matty is AMAZING thank you for whatever you've done to make this our favorite place again. Yay!  Everyone needs to go now!"}
{"text":"Great great food and drinks. I wish they had a few more features mixed drinks but my husband loves the selection of beers. The bar tenders are personable. Only real complaint is they don't always play the redskins games"}
{"text":"This review is for a catering order. We ordered a large order of Pulled Pork and the darker of the two sauces for a party. Ordered a week before then confirmed and added a little the day before. It was ready and hot at the exact time we had arranged to pick it up and was delicious! Won't hesitate to order again for gatherings."}
{"text":"Previous comment was deleted. The food was terrible, ordered pulled pork sandwiches that were cold and dry. Even the toasted bun was cold.  We got up and left. Do not eat here is my advice"}
{"text":"Mac's is good but not great, especially when it comes to most of the food.  As some others have said, the bar, beer, atmosphere, etc. is at minimum 4 stars, same on the service side.

The food, especially their BBQ, is just 2 stars, well below middle of the road though.  The brisket is generally dry and sliced WAY too thick while the pulled pork has a mild smoke flavor but not as much as one would expect, it also tends to come out with too much fat vs. being pulled properly.  The coleslaw is hit or miss.  When it's properly dressed, it has a really nice, slightly spicy flavor but, too many times (like my visit this weekend) it comes out almost like dry shredded cabbage mix that got spritzed with vinegar.

The good of the food for me includes the onion rings which are fresh made and really tasty dipped in BBQ sauce. I also like their salad which is pretty basic shredded lettuce and not much else but, you get lots of blue cheese and bacon.  The burgers taste good too but are a bit dry.  That is on ridiculous NC state food preparation laws though, not as much on Mac's.  Lots of toppings to choose from as well which is nice.

While there are better food options around, I like the rest of the package enough to go hang out at the bar and grab a bite every once in a while."}
{"text":"I've had two incredibly different experiences at this place. One so great that I was dying to come back and the subsequent one so shitty that I'm not sure if I'll ever return.

The first time was with a friend who was passing through Charlotte. We sat outside to enjoy the amazing weather and catch up. He had a ton of wings (they were half off) and I had the brisket sandwich. We started the meal with fried pickles and pimento cheese. Everything rocked, from the service to the meal.

The second time I brought my girl, sat outside again (in the same table even), and looked forward to another great meal. What we received instead was horrible service. Our waitress cared so little about what she was doing it felt like she was in physical pain just having to stand there and take our order. We had better service from the other waitresses handling the outside than from our own. We could only suffer through ordering a drink and then left as quickly as we could.

I'm torn. Five stars on one hand and one star on another. I know that two data points don't make a trend, but after such an uneven experience I find it difficult to convince myself to go back for a third time."}
{"text":"Old hickory rubby red logger! Best beer ever! Kansas city beef rib! #omg so good!  Great place to hangout and watch the game and you can even have your dog outside!  

All the desserts are good!
Wings are thick and sticky!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night date night. Had a short wait but once we sat down and got our food....   everything was amazing.  Well worth the wait. GET THE BRISKET ENDS, on the appetizer menu. They are amazing. I will come back again and again, just for that!!!   We both got the spark plug burger.  Absolutely amazing. We enjoyed every bite.  Half of it filled me up. So my hubby gets the other half for lunch tomorrow.
The waitress walked by with a plate of nachos and we agree we have to come back for that....  the plate was loaded!!!!!

Definitely check this place out.  Come back again and again.
Great place. 
Everyone is welcome and fits in easily!"}
{"text":"So the first time I was hear I called and went to the area to pay this time I came in Stood Dora minute where about 7 employees are standing around so I then I sit sit down because someone was at the seat I orginallybsat at the 1st time.Finally I said something where about 4 people wants to address me after I had to get someones attention. So I'm now spending $15 on food that I kinda don't want to eat because just coming in to pay a to go order was not delightful at all"}
{"text":"My first time at Mac's... hushpuppies with butter dip were awesome. The smoked wings are definitely top notch... will come back just for the smokey wings! We did, however, have a really LONG wait before we ever saw a waitress because we were \"triple sat\", whatever that means. Regardless, a tray of hushpuppies and a quick I'll be back ASAP buys a lot of patience from patrons, if you know what I mean. Anyway, it was a very short walk from the Lynx station, the atmosphere was fun, and service was great (once they finally got there)."}
{"text":"Best barbeque in town so far. I grabbed a pulled barbeque chicken platter today with my choice of 2 sides which i chose the macoroni and cheese,and potatoe salad.This location is quite different than the location in south end area. Just vibe wise,almost the same set up this is a bikers type feel, their moto is beer,bikes,and barbeque, i don't drink beer,i don't own or ride bikes but one thing i do is eat barbeque for sure and if i ever have a taste for anything barbeque this is my go to spot can i get a one time whoooooooo in my rick flair voice for mac's speed shop."}
