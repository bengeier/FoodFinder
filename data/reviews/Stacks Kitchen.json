{"text":"Good food. Fast, attentive and pleasant service. They check in with you, make sure your coffee or drink is refilled.   I have been here a few times. They are always crowded  .. however the crowds never affect the quality and attentiveness of service.   4 stars - Because I wish they had more choices for someone that eats no meat."}
{"text":"Had George's pastichio with a Greek salad and a biscuit. Pastichio was average at best. The bottom was burned and the red sauce (or gravy) was bland. The Greek salad was excellent. The biscuit would have been a hockey puck if it was black. Sent it back and the replacement wasn't much better (1:00pm. Not sure how many days ago the biscuit was made).  Waitress was nice, and she brought the food out quickly. She checked back once to see if everything was alright. I kinda beat the biscuit on the table a couple of times without saying a word. She grabbed it and went back to the kitchen with it.  Typical Greek restaurant, and crowded for lunch. I want to try their other dishes that looked good on the menu and that other diners were having. I have had their breakfast, which was average. Price is right for their food."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. The Skillets is where it's at if you ask me. Tony and the rest of the staff are great!  The food is off the hook.  Try it you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We had a week day off and wanted to enjoy a nice breakfast without the kids. Usually we go to Cracker Barrel which is always good food and customer service! However, my wife talked me into trying Stacks because she and her girlfriend ate at Stacks before and had a decent experience.     The wait time was minimal.  When we got seated we ordered water with lemons. Our waitress Maglena, I think is how you spell her name, brought us water, but no lemons. I understand that waiters/waitresses have other people to wait on as well, so no biggie. However,  when asked a second time for a simple request like lemons, you need to expeditiously get that customers needs taken care of!  Customer service 101.   After taking our order, still no lemons,  a few minutes later the manager (George) came around to see how things are going, I stated we've asked for lemons twice with no success, he apologized and immediately went and got us lemons which is what should've happend earlier.    When the food came out, which required syrup, we waited for a few more minutes hoping our waitress Maglena or the person who brought the food out would bring some syrup back...common sense right, but no one did...Maglena's attitude was not pleasant from the beginning and just got worse!  Once again the manager (George) came to check on us and to see if we needed anything.  I told him it would be nice to have syrup with my pancakes and my wife's French toast.  He apologized again and immediately went to get us some syrup. At this point I was ready to leave.   Anyway, Maglena brought our check and after reviewing the check there were charges that she failed to mention when we ordered.  At checkout the cashier went to get her so she could explain the details of our check and at that point she mentioned what the extra charges were for.  I told her/them you may want to explain ANY extra charges prior to completing the order going forward, because you never told us.  The food was equivalent to the special price, not much flavor.     The only reason why I didn't rate them 0 stars was because of George, trying to make things right. Unfortunately, the damage was done. Hopefully, she will learn that each customer is very valuable, especially in the restaurant industry and personal feelings have nothing to with business!  YOU and I know exactly what I mean."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service multiple times and mediocre food. There is No way we will go back there."}
{"text":"Eggs are good .but...waffles were thick and doughy. Grits were served cold. My family and I heard great things about Stacks for breakfast..none of us were impressed enough to return."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service at their main location.  Who the hell serves COLD syrup with hot pancakes??? We weren't even offered warm or cold; the waitress simply slapped it on the table on a drive-by. The pancakes were probably the best tasting I've had in years but being given cold syrup ruined it.  We were unaware it was cold until AFTER my boyfriend drenched the cakes in the syrup.    His omelette had waaaayyyy too much raw green pepper in it ; so much so he was immediately sick after.  My biscuits were light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was peppery, and not overly so.  Definitely would recommend the food but go to the Waxhaw  location.  Maybe the service is better.   Previous visits were pretty much the same: great food,  shitty service and NOT worth the ridiculous wait either."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!! We were so hungry, and this place did not disappoint. If you like corned beef hash, they know how to make it. The portions are huge, so come hungry. I have no complaints about this place. We were even given cornbread while we were waiting. We will be here again...and again....and again!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to breakfast place after moving.  I've tried several things and haven't been disappointed.  Brought my family here when they were visiting and everyone from my dad to my 3 yo neice was able to get something they really wanted.  Not the most innovative menu, but lots of variety. The service has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had reserved their private room for an event only for them to bump us for a larger party. All they care about is money. Obviously, the larger party will be spending more, so they bumped us. We have been customers of theirs for a long time, not any more. Won't set foot in there ever again."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Never even got to try the food (or table service for that matter.) After waiting 30 minutes for a 20 minute wait, we discovered they had not written our name on the list when we checked in. Their solution was to offer our party of 3 \"open seating\" at the counter, where there was 1 open stool. Thanks. I won't go back. They seemed very busy, so I doubt they will miss my business."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast spot in the metro.  Stuffed French Toast is probably the best thing I have eaten for breakfast in my life.  Great Job all the way around...must try!"}
{"text":"Just left. Didn't even eat. Too many tables were open and available,  but no one was getting seated and it was very crowded.  Poor front-end management."}
{"text":"Did a search on Yelp since I wanted something other than IHOP and Cracker Barrel.  One thing prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  We we sat in the dining room connected to the bathrooms, 2 booths from their doors closest to the bakery.  I could smell the bathroom/s from our booth.  I don't know about you but that's the last thing I want to smell while eating.  I recommend a stronger exhaust fan in both!!!!!  With that being said, the food was great and so was the service.  Unbeknownst to me, a little gem in my neighborhood!  Prices are reasonable too!  By the time we finished it was hopping busy!"}
{"text":"Home cooked style breakfast - everything hot and just as ordered. Friendly staff, reasonable price   Grits were on point !"}
{"text":"I had the stuffed pancakes, it was stuffed and big.  The coffee was good and the service quick.  I enjoyed my meal and had a great breakfast.  The place was bug and can accommodate a lot of customers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Prices are great! I wish they were open for dinner so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"The wait times are usually crazy long, but with good reason. There isn't a better breakfast spot in SE CLT or Matthews. I've never ordered a bad thing here, but for a place that calls itself Stacks, the pancakes aren't anything too special. If you do go for the pancakes, be sure to try their toppings.   The coffee is also a nice perk, always fresh and always delicious."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say. They're my new favorite hashbrowns. Go hungry, they give you a ton of food. Prices are incredibly reasonable for what you get. You do have to wait a little while, but it's because they're packed,  because it's good.  Enough people have left negative reviews to convince me they aren't perfect. But my personal experience today was flawless, and the crowd leads me to believe that they get it right far more often than not.   Greatness. Try it."}
{"text":"While visiting from out of town, myself and three other patrons decided to visit this establishment as it was the first suggestion by siri. I can tell you that I'm no stranger to food, and Stacks ranks among the top of \"The list\". The four of us ordered three different entrees and there was nary a mutter of complaint. The waiter was also one of the best I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Any future trips to this area will include a visit to Stacks!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now for breakfast on the weekend, the food is really good. However, you get lots of food. The stuffed French toast is about 5 inches tall & the hashbrowns are plentiful. It's cheap, it's good ,it's filling, & it's clean.  I sit at the counter and have no service problems at all."}
{"text":"Did not know this place existed and it didn't show up on a search for breakfast restaurants. Nice breakfast, fabulous atmosphere, good coffee; one of the few good breakfast restaurants in Charlotte. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here twice it was so good. And if in town we'll be sure to come back!!! Eggs are cooked to order. Coffee is delish and hot and plentiful. The staff is friendly, caring and curteous....even when busy! You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We tried out Stacks for the first and last today.  While the management was very nice to us, offering pastries and muffins while we waited for a table, the 45 minute wait for our food after ordering, along with the poor quality of the food will ensure we won't come back.  When the waitress saw that my wife didn't eat her food (corned beef hash that was too salty to eat served along with soggy hash browns), rather than taking steps to correct the situation, it seemed to just make her angry.  Bizarre reaction."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  Was not expecting them to blow my socks off, but they did!  Come hungry and come often!  We went at around noon on a Sunday, with a party of 5, 3 adults and 2 toddlers.  The wait quoted was 25-30 minutes, which isn't bad for a Sunday, and while we were waiting, they came around with trays of cornbread samples and also gave my kids a cookie each and offered coffee.  2of us ordered the stuffed french toast, which was fantastic!  My husband ordered the corned beef hash and eggs, and was equally impressed with the homemade hash, and that his eggs were cooked correctly.  We ordered pancakes for my 3 year old and she was able to share the 2 enormous pancakes with her brother!  The service was very good, also!  We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with stacks. Great quick breakfast with decent prices! Usually go at least once a month!"}
{"text":"I ordered biscuits and gravy.  The gravy was barely covering the biscuits.  I asked for more gravy and was treated like a King.  When the bill was laid carefully under the pot on the table, it included a charge of $1.50 for the extra gravy. I cannot eat dry food.  We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot in Matthews. It is always crowded. The breakfast specials Monday-Friday are a great deal. I went with the short stack of French toast which was plenty of food. This is made with homemade challah bread. Added 2 scrambled eggs which were perfectly done. The bacon was seasoned nicely and cooked to perfection. Only downside to this place is their below average coffee."}
{"text":"French toast is amazing, both stuffed and traditional versions.  Don't get the full order unless you are beyond hungry.  Never had a bad experience and look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Looks like it's run by family. Food was very good. But the service was terrible. We were there at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon. So the restaurant was only half full. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, which we believe was related to our server, Renne, who was very inattentive. We watched as she stood around talking to people while our food was most likely in the kitchen. Another server delivered it when she was in middle of a conversation. Not to mention that we had waited quite a while for her to come and take our order in the first place.  It's too bad because I've just moved her from NY and am looking for great places to eat. I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!   We went on a Saturday morning and there was a small wait. But it was worth it because the food is great. I got the short stack French toast and it was great. My boyfriend enjoyed his skillet which was very big. Overall this place is great with decent food prices. We will be back to try the pecan pancakes another Saturday this month."}
{"text":"this is a Hidden Gem in Matthews. My wife and I were searching for a place to go to breakfast, because we've really been trying to pay attention to what we eat and work on losing a few pounds. We decided to give this place a try, and I ordered the egg white omelet with cheese and sausage, and my wife ordered a garden omelette that was with egg whites too. The food was really great, and the service was good. I look forward to trying some more stuff on the menu, including some of the baked goods which were in great abundance at the front and look very tasty."}
{"text":"Stacks has become a favorite breakfast for me and my grandchildren.  So many great choices. The kids love the pancakes and I love the egg dishes.  Quick service and friendly waitresses make this a sure win."}
{"text":"I only rated Stacks Kitchen four stars because the service has never impressed me. The food is so delicious, though, I really hardly care. I just arrived home after trying Stacks for the second time. The first time I went with two friends and had one of their day's specials, a Cajun shrimp wrap. It was to die for. It was so good, I had to bring my husband back to check this place out. The hostess seemed nice, but confused or maybe overwhelmed. We we told there would be a ten-minute wait. No big deal, whatever. Packed place. A couple minutes later, the man that I have been assuming is the owner (friendly dark-haired hype man with an accent?) comes by, says \"just to two of you?\" in a surprised manner, and seats us. It was almost as if he was wondering why she had us waiting. Strange. On the way to our seats, he asked if we had ever tried the french toast. He recommended their special of Cannoli cream french toast, and I thought to myself, \"Sure, it's made out of yesterday's bread. Why would you not push it?\" However, the longer I thought about it the more it made sense. I had already tried and loved the savory-lunch route here. Why not go sweet-breakfast route this time? Plus he just seems so nice, and like he genuinely cares about your experience. I figured he wouldn't lead me wrong. Yeah, he didn't lead me wrong. My cannoli french toast was ah-mazing. It was the most delicious sweet breakfast I have ever tasted. The cream inside was perfectly sweet and had a lot of substance, sticking well between the toast layers and adding a great textural element to the just-firm-enough toast. The strawberries on top were tart and a smart touch, the tartness really cutting through the cream. Refreshing. My husband ordered shrimp and grits which were also some of the best we have tasted outside of our own kitchen. The like sauce topping the grits tasted meaty and homey, like a red eye gravy. He was pleased, and he is a picky shrimp and gritter. A lot of reviews mention the lacking service. I have to say, it's not the best i've had but it's far from the worst. Our waitress did forget our order and have to come back. When our waitress forgot to return to re-fill our drinks, the owner noticed and came to do it himself. A really sweet touch- not something an owner has to do. I like Stacks Kitchen a whole lot. I've already agreed with a few friends that this will be out go-to meet up spot in Matthews. They deserve our regular business."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around noon. Was seated 30 minutes after that. The host station staff was very friendly. They were passing out corn bread pieces for everyone that was waiting to be seated. Upon seating, our waitress was quick and asked for our drink order. Sweet tea all around. My soon to be husband had the traditional sausage, scrambled eggs, grits and biscuit. I had the chicken pot pie. We figured that my order old take a little longer because mostly everyone there was ordering breakfast items. When our meals came out, his eggs were done perfectly. Sausage well seasoned and grits were on point. I was presented with this giant masterpiece of puff pasty sitting on top of a bed of creamy chicken pot pie filling. It looked overwhelming at first but when you cut into the puff pastry, it was like cutting into layers of clouds. AMAZING! We will be coming back to try their skillets and other baked good items that were enclosed in a glass case."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE diner in the entire Charlotte area. The stuffed French toast is the size of a birthday cake! We ordered 2 and it des my husband, son and I and then fed us all AGAIN the next night for dinner. Honey stung chicken, pot pie - everything we have tried there has been awesome.  The bakery inside is better than 95% of stand-alone bakeries and is cheap, too!  The people there are so sweet! They have a live on the Sunday mornings (you can't give them a bad review for that - it means the place is worth trying! Seriously...) they brought those folks in line coffee and biscuits and muffins.  Go! Go now! We are :)"}
{"text":"Food = 5-stars. Wait staff & kitchen = 4-stars.  Management =ZERO STARS!  Really great diner-style, \"Americana\" type food in very large quantities with a good wait staff- all at reasonable prices. Table service and kitchen times are good, even at full capacity but don't try to eat here when there is any wait at all.   The management does not know how to move people through or how to handle seating from a wait list. Bussed and clean tables routinely sit empty for 15 minutes while the hostess tries to muddle her way through seating customers. Paying your check is equally bad as register operations and payments seem to take forever. This obviously \"family run\" business needs serious professional management help.   Their one positive is that the kitchen and wait staff are run well."}
{"text":"So this morning we drove 30 min. to this diner. Location? Great. Very clean and nice decor. I ordered the Athenian skillet and pancakes and my husband ordered the south or the border omelette with French toast. The skillet was amazing 5 stars. My only true complaint is that the pancakes were tasteless. I believe if they were thinner then they would have taste better and my husband said the same about the French toast. I do believe this place is worth the drive if you live in the Charlotte area.  I just feel that if an establishment is going to serve breakfast all day then their pancakes and French toast have to improve."}
{"text":"Well, we went back and I asked the waitress if I could order something special and she said I could. I wanted the corned beef hash and eggs but I wanted the corned beef hash smothered over the rye toast and the two eggs I wanted poached on top of that and all of it smothered I m hollandaise sauce. It came out with such a small amount of corned beef hash and hollandaise sauce that it looked very dry with all the bread hanging out around the sides. I asked why I got so little as my wife had much more as she ordered the same thing minus the hollandaise sauce so I asked for a little more. The waitress got the manager and he said that it was a eggs benedict and that they weigh out the amount of corned beef. When I said that I did not order an eggs benedict he wanted to argue with me. I said listen, I ordered the exact same thing as did my wife only I wanted it stacked on top of my toast with some hollandaise sauce. I would have more than been willing to pay the extra for the hollandaise sauce but instead he sent me a plate of corned beef on the side and to my amazement they charged me another $5.95. Now the food was good and I ate almost all that was laid out before me but still. I know what I ordered and to have a manager stand and argue over that with a resturant full of patrons to me is beyond reproach. To me it is a great example of when a bussiness is enjoying enough success that if and when anyone has an issue they are treated with reproach and somewhat hostility. It took close to 20 minutes just to get our check. And then it was all but throwed at us. My worst experience at any Charlotte area restaurant to date. Sorry for the book but felt compelled to write this as no customer should ever be treaded in such a manner nor charged extra for the restaurants mistake."}
{"text":"This place is a real find,  Food is fresh, prepared to order, huge portions.  Service is excellent, prices reasonable.  Went there with a group of 17 today.  Food came very quickly, and each dish was absolutely delicious.  Lovely presentations, almost looked too good to eat.  So pretty that we took pictures.  Between us we had various sandwiches, chicken salad fruit plates, pastichio, baked ziti, eggs, French toast, pancakes.  The desserts are to die for.  Lightest cheesecake anywhere, luscious chocolate cake. Everyone in the group is ready to go back very soon."}
{"text":"First time here and oh so good!  I wish we had come sooner!  My husband had the chicken pot pie which was to die for!  It was so good that I had trouble staying out of it!  Fresh, puffed pastry that was huge with a creamy chicken sauce.  Awesome!  My friend had the shrimp and grits and it was also great!  The next times we come, I am going to plan on ordering the pot pie and shrimp and grits!  I had the patty melt burger plate and it was really good but just a patty melt.  They didn't scrimp on any of the serving sizes and it was worth the wait that we had on Saturday afternoon.  Breakfast also looks yummy and is served all day long.  I just wish this place was open for dinner!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with anything on the menu and reminds me of a good ny deli. Their is usually a wait for weekend breakfast but we'll worth it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was really good and it all tasted fresh. Even the strawberries on my pancakes were crisp and juicy. They were big portions and tasted good."}
{"text":"Very Good breakfast, anything they serve is well done Great French toast \" huge order \" Good service."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! The crunchy monkey pancakes are delicious! Lots of food for a fair price! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! We are from out of town and wanted to eat at a local breakfast place that we don't have back home. We could have waited about 10 minutes for a table but the counter is first come first serve so we sat there. Our server recommended French toast over the pancakes and I'm so glad she suggested it! It was great! The portions are huge for the money. I ordered the special which was two huge pieces of French toast and sausage/bacon. My fiancé had the lumberjack stacks which was pancakes, eggs, a biscuit, and sausage/bacon. All of the food was great! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever visited Stacks. I've always drove by & never actually tried it out. So today I finally came in tried for myself. When you walk in it definitely has this diner vibe. There was so many options on the menu & I knew before ordering I wanted to try the stuffed French toast because I  did my homework & read previous reviews, it was one of the popular item on the menu. I ordered the Egg Benedict with hash brown which was scrumptious by the way. When the French toast came out..my eyes got really big, it was massive! in my opinion. Food was good for the portion & price. It was delicious & I will come back, it's nice place for a yummy brunch with friends for sure."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my wife for the 1st time & it was excellent! On a very busy Sunday morning we got seated within 20mins. The food came out fast & was hot & just the way we ordered it. The service was wonderful & at first I felt they had fair prices, but after seeing how big the portions were I knew we made out in the deal. As full as I was when leaving I still managed to take out some of the amazing desserts from the bakery. Would I go back you ask? I'm debating about going for lunch."}
{"text":"great breakfast / brunch.  French toast is really really good.  Western omelet also very good ... better than others I've tried.  CLEAN.  100% restaurant inspection when we visited ..you almost never see that! Prompt attentive service, personable manager.  Even tho very busy our order did not take long.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent local diner! Visited for breakfast on a Sunday. Food was delicious, especially the French toast made with fresh thick slices of bread, grilled to perfection. Despite busy restaurant staff was very attentive. Any staff member who walked by our table smiled and asked if we needed anything. Great customer service with great food!"}
{"text":"So my two sisters and I came on a Saturday around 11AM. We waited a little over 15 minutes to get seated and our food arrived about ten minutes. We got a cup of chicken noodle soup for $2.25. We also got the caramel mocha Belgium waffle ($5.25) and that was AMAZING. It was very different and the waffle was light and fluffy just the way I like it. I am definitely coming back for this! (I think it's only served on Saturdays). I RECOMMEND. We got the 3 berry chocolate chip pancake ($7.95). These pancakes are large. We couldn't finish it but it was delicious. The service was nice. Everyone made sure we got what we needed and treated us respectfully. I don't really remember our server's name (I think Vivian or something...), but she was super kind and helped clean our mess. I would definitely recommend. Prices are fair and portions are good to share."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast in the area that everyone seems to know about.  So a lot of times there's a wait but it's well worth it!  If the wait is long a lot of times the staff will go around offering coffee and cornbread to those waiting to be seated.  Loved the baked goods!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch/brunch. She had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy and fried okra. I had corned beef hash, hash browns and eggs over easy.  The \"meat\" loaf barely qualified as meat. It had the consistency of mush and absolutely no meat, onion or any flavor except maybe condensed milk??? Odd flavor and texture. The mashed potatoes and gravy had the same odd flavor. As I said the closest flavor may have been canned condensed milk. She didn't finish it and sent it back. The fried okra was ok. My hash browns and eggs were fine. Pretty hard to mess up! The corned beef hash looked ok, but the only thing I could taste was onion. I like onion, but it had NO corned beef flavor at all. I will say that the service was good and the did take the meatloaf off the bill. I may try them again, but .... not sure."}
{"text":"Must've just been very busy that day. We've been back a few times since and LOVE stacks! It is a family favorite! If only they were open for dinner too..."}
{"text":"We went to Stacks Kitchen one Sunday morning for breakfast, with low expectations.  It's in what barely constitutes a strip mall in a so-so part of town.  The restaurant always seemed like it had a lot of cars out front, though, and the reviews were pretty good on Yelp.    Upon first entry into the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was much cleaner and nicer than I anticipated.  We were a party of five, so we had to wait a little longer than others.  The tables and booths in the sunlit front (and, in my opinion, much nicer) dining room all only seat four people.  Unfortunately, that not only extended our wait time, but also limited our dining room options.  We were seated in the back dining room, which is ok, but doesn't have the cheerful ambiance that the main dining room has.  It felt more like a church basement that's been set up for an event than an actual diner/restaurant like the main dining room in front.    As one can see from the menu (and the HUGE dessert display case as you walk in), it's a Greek-owned diner/restaurant.  The menu was pretty extensive; there were lots of entrees I wanted to try (which makes it good for repeat business).  I opted for the Florentine Omelette with spinach, tomatoes and feta.  It was made with four (!!) eggs; the portions were definitely a good size, so no one should leave hungry.    We'll definitely come back.  I just need to come next time with at least one less person."}
{"text":"Man I love this place! Had a dental appt in concord and we were going to meet a friend in Matthews so I picked this spot based on yelp reviews! I had the corned beef hash with the hash browns and whole wheat toast. First of all the butter is amazing! Yummy! I finished all of mine! The corned beef hash was one of the best I've had! It's all home made btw! Yummy!!! There were these Texas Pete's peppers on the table that were a great addition to the dish!  Hubby had the stuffed French toast at my request. It was so delicious! And the helping is HUGE!!!  This place is going to become a favorite!"}
{"text":"I had the Lumberjack breakfast.  Large serving portions.  The food was good.  I didn't try the fresh squeezed OJ, but I hear it's really good.  My friend had ordered a side of hash browns and he was not impressed.  He said, \"they were dry.\" The place is clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"PERFECT BREAKFAST. Came here after Coffee and Cars Charlotte for some breakfast. I got the big skillet. I did not leave hungry, actually I have breakfast for the next two days! Walsh sharable by 2 people of you wanted to."}
{"text":"I would have loved to try out this restaurant as I had heard great things about the Waxhaw location.  My husband called at 10 am on Sunday told them we would be coming at 12:30 with 6 people and asked if they took reservations.  The hostess said they did not take reservations but we didn't need to call-ahead since there would not be a long wait at 12:30.    So after church we drove the 20 minutes there and found a 40 minute wait.  I said to the hostess we were told there would be hardly any wait at 12:30 so we didn't need to call-ahead and she turned to the other hostess and said, \"Did you tell them that?\"  The other hostess shrugged and said, \"Yes\".  The first hostess said, \"I don't know why she said that since it's Sunday.\"  They offered no apologies.  Unfortunately my children were very hungry and there was not a safe place for them to wait 40 minutes (inside was full of people standing and waiting and outside full of the same, only spot to stand would have been a busy parking lot).   At this point we decided to just eat something at home, much to everyone's disappointment.    I do not fault them for being busy.  It is good for them that they are busy.  But they need to be honest with customers.  I would not have driven over there with hungry children if they had told me from the beginning the wait would be long.   They also need to have better customer service manners when they have made a mistake."}
{"text":"Pretty much a better version of your standard breakfast diner. Big menu, quick service. Food is good-not extraordinary but worth going back for. Weekend mornings are a mess and you will wait but for the area there is def nothing better for a traditional breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Angie was the best waitress! The owner checked on us twice and all the customers to make certain we were enjoying our meal.  We went for breakfast and will go back another day for lunch. PS...go hungry, we both brought food home, enough for another meal!!"}
{"text":"So it's pretty crowded on weekend and we wait for 30 minutes and five of us sit in a four man table but it's ok it takes a little long to order ' the waitress was helpful but I think they need more waiter or waitress . The food was great I order a California skillet ' great!!!!!!!! Maybe go other time"}
{"text":"Stacks kitchen is an extremely delicious restaurant that has the best breakfast around. They have a decent little bakery although it is not as fresh as a real bakery, everything is tasty. I love getting omelettes and they also have a healthy crunch bowl which is delicious. And make sure that you get there early especially on the weekends because there is usually a decent wait time and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat. The staff is friendly. The food is good and so is the service. Usually a long wait but that's due to its popularity."}
{"text":"I went a few times years ago. Food wasn't all that good.  Wanted to try them out again today.  I was told 20-25 minute wait. I waited 34 minutes to get a table. We placed order and had been waiting for an hour. We noticed that people received their food before and we were seated before them. I let the male manager know and asked him check on out food.  He said it was coming in about 3 minutes. 10 minutes went by. Nothing. We left and will never return again.  The food isn't that good and the customer service is awful."}
{"text":"Stacks us a great place to eat. The food is good and prices are reasonable.  I love their Chef Salad.  They are  only open for breakfast and lunch.  I sure wish they were open for dinner."}
{"text":"Super good. The wait can be long and the strip mall is sketchy af but the French toast will make you forget all that."}
{"text":"I've probably passed this place a thousand times and had no idea until I was scoping yelp for breakfast spots. I ordered stuffed french toast (to go) and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday workday around 10:45 am. I figured it wouldn't be busy but I was wrong... we had a 20 minute wait. I thought that was a good sign though and was okay with waiting! I got the orange juice and eggs benedict. The OJ is fresh squeezed and delicious though its very expensive. The eggs benedict was an excellent choice as well. Stacks has a huge menu with a lot of variety. The prices are reasonable. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the service. We sat at our table for 20 minutes waiting for a check. The waitress was not very attentive throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast anytime.  Sometimes a wait but usually not more than 15 minutes.  Price specials before 11am.  The only thing missing is a bar (e.g. a Bloody Mary or Mimosa with brunch would be a nice option).    Sidenote: There is a Tattoo Parlor next door in Matthews and for whatever reason they decided to have a DJ and loud Top 40 playing.  Hope it was a one-time thing.  I love music, but what they were playing was downright obnoxious.  Don't mean for this part of my comment to reflect on Stacks - you cannot choose your neighbors - but the landlord should step in and fix it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat breakfast on a Sunday morning and stacks kitchen kept popping up so we decided to try it. We were sat immediately (arrived around 9am on a Sunday) and it has a nice homey feel. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. I ordered a Sunday special which was the Caribbean waffle which had coconut, mango, bananas and strawberries on top. The waffle was really dense. Almost too thick for me to eat. But it tasted good. My husband got the garden omelet and said it was delicious. One of the better omelets he has had. The grits were good. Cooked nicely . The hash browns were kind of bland but add a bit of salt and you are good to go. It was a bit expensive. For both of us to eat breakfast it was $23 which is expensive for breakfast. Overall not a bad deal though."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast!!  Try the florentine eggs Benedict !! You will not be sorry .  Great service.   Sit at the counter top.  You get to talk to everyone !!  Local flavor !!  2 locations in town,,  clean and very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"A slight step up from your typical greasy spoon breakfast place. Portions are huge, even for sides! The menu is also quite large and all items are served all day.  I ordered the farmers wrap with a side of grits and hash browns. Wrap was OK and the hash browns were alright, but both suffered from a lack of seasoning. Next time, I will order the farmer's omelet which was a bit tastier. I will also be sure to request the hash browns be served crispy. Husband also ordered a side of turnip greens which seemed to be just thawed frozen greens stuck in a bowl with no seasoning.  Even with these \"notes for next time,\" I still feel that this is a banging breakfast spot to which I would enthusiastically return to. Our table mates ordered the French toast which looked amazing and I was impressed by the cook and portion size of the side of bacon. Also, fresh squeezed juice will get you brownie points every time. Coffee was good too!"}
{"text":"We happened by Stacks as we were in the neighborhood on a Saturday morning. The line was literally out the door, but we were able to get a seat right at the counter. I had the Burrito Wrap which was delicious and my girlfiend had a BLT that she said was very good too. Great food, affordable prices, and service was OK, but they were busy."}
{"text":"Great prices, lots of food. Amazing southern breakfast place. Definitely recommend to everyone. Nice staff. Great service."}
{"text":"I told the parents of one of my students that I love to eat and try new places so they recommended Stacks, so we gave it a try this past Saturday. I had the caramel mocha waffle, which was supposed to be a cappuccino waffle with chocolate chips on top with a caramel drizzle and whipped cream. I think they may have forgotten the caramel on mine because I had eaten about a quarter of the waffle and realized I hadn't tasted any. But overall, it was a good waffle, it didn't knock off my socks, but I ate it all along with the turkey sausage patties. My son had a burger with bacon and steak fries...I love steak fries and theirs didn't disappoint. He said the burger was good. My Love ordered and omelette and it was also very good. The wait staff was extremely pleasant, and someone came around with a tray of samples while we waited to be seated...and I wasn't mad! Whatever it was, it was moist and yummy. Their dessert display looked amazing as well. I'd definitely give this place another shot in the future, and so should you!"}
{"text":"Great food, good people. I've probably had 70% of the items on their menu and have yet to have a bad meal.  I subtracted 1 star simply due to the difficult time finding a parking space. Whether dining in or take out, if they are busy, which they are 80% of the time, there simply is no place to park. You'll find yourself driving around with 5 other vehicles doing the same waiting for somebody to leave.  If just based on food and customer service, this would be an easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service took entirely too long and the food was mediocre. Staff seemed overwhelmed and disappeared frequently. They have multiple signs claiming they have fresh squeezed orange juice but it's just grocery store floridas natural carton orange juice that comes out warm with a few ice cubes.   Was excited to go here for lunch and was disappointed. Maybe breakfast is better but it's not worth the long wait. I just found its better to go to Cracker Barrel because their menu is slightly similar.   Their fried green tomatoes were actually very good and a highlight of the meal. Try it for breakfast but stay away from their lunch hours."}
{"text":"Best deal in town during the week! Great food, great price, great service! Staff is  very friendly and customer oriented!"}
{"text":"Great place for decent breakfast or brunch reminiscent of old diners. Very friendly staff. They have lots of options to choose from and the portions are fairly large. It's pretty inexpensive for the quality of the food that you get as well. The only downside is the wait since it gets pretty crowded, especially on weekends. I'd say on average at least 20 mins of wait time on Saturday/Sunday and maybe 10 mins on weekdays."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. Come early they do get busy. The skillets are good and my kids love the waffles. Coffee could use an upgrade. Don't let the outside appearance fool you inside it is very upscale and clean."}
{"text":"Such a great family/friend spot.  I always eat breakfast at brunch, but they have tons of great options.  The food is always hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch/brunch, so many choices.  If it wasn't close to the holidays would have gone with pumpkin pancakes, sounded delicious. Chose harvest salad with huge piece of chicken breast, cranberries,  pecans and a bit of goat cheese.  Left off the bacon and had dressing on the side.  Good size portion, super service, nice atmosphere was quiet enough to converse and not so quiet you could hear any other conversations.  Cannot believe I have driven by a hundred times and never stopped.  Bonus....saw a high school friend from Ohio having lunch with a friend. We caught up and chatted for a bit."}
{"text":"The place is a basic diner nothing sticks out. They get very busy so they must have something special going on. Not sure that i will take the time to find out what others find so special."}
{"text":"Came here with the entire family (2 adults, 1 teen, 1 preschool) and had an amazing experience. We ordered Stuffed French Toast, Shrimp and Grits with a side salad, Chocolate Chip Pancakes, a full order of bacon and oatmeal with strawberries and brown sugar. Our entire meal was $32 which was a steal. It was delicious. Everyone was extremely full and over half of the Shrimp and Grits came home as all portion sizes are enormous. The wait was only about 10 minutes on Saturday at 11:30 and staff was fantastic. We will now definitely be regulars for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because of their gluten free French toast. I give those 5 stars and the restaurant... well I've experienced better service other places, therefore, I give four stars. I think the waitresses could be a little friendlier.  I've never really had any major issues here. Food was always fresh and hot. The only thing missing is the staff going out of their way to make the experience a great one. I'm big on customer service, so I'd recommend that."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good the food is amazing and everyone here is so sweet and helpful. Our waiter was Spiros, he was so nice and made sure we had all we needed and either the manager or owner came around and helped us pick out a dessert. We got their homemade cheesecake which was so yummy! This is my third time here and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. Whether it's breakfast or lunch everything is tasteful and you get a lot of it."}
{"text":"First time here. Why? I don't know? I drive pass this place all the time and I know folks who love it. And! I love any place that serves breakfast all day. First; the waitress was phenomenal. The place was swamped and she was on top of it and happy! The food was good but ... they did not cook mine to order. In addition... there was a hair ... no bueno! But you expect this occasionally eating out. My wife's food was good and she had no complaints. The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent and the coffee was exceptional. The price was right and we will be going back."}
{"text":"If I still lived in Matthews I'd hang my hat here.  You'd find me at the counter chatting it up with the locals or Rosa Lee, the part time matriarch of Stacks.  Nicole would top off my coffee as I am figuring out what's for breakfast.  Today I ordered a basic with link sausage (chubby little  ones), and a side of sausage gravy.  It was all cooked to order and the whole experience came off without a hitch.  They do diner good (yes, I know poor grammar).  My preference for a great diner, however, is for something with that extra kick.  Zada Jane's has some quirky ideas on omelets, Flying Biscuit rips some slammin' riffs on eggs, and Midnite Diner simply kicks butt as an extraordinary diner.  Nobody beats their sausage gravy, but Stacks, well, you came close.  Super clean.  Super friendly.  Super prices.  Great local family restaurant.  Just arrive early  (or late) to beat the crowds."}
{"text":"You usually have to wait about 5 to 10 minutes. The food is great and the service is outstanding. If you like java Jeff coffee they serve it here. You will not be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"Stacks is the bomb Diggity breakfast spot in Matthews. I have been here a few times and I will definitely go more. There menu is huge and everything is made fresh to order, expect a crowd because it's always busy. They are only open 6am till 3pm you can get breakfast all day.  My mom got a cheeseburger and french fries it, she fully enjoyed it, had to get a to go box it was a massive burger. I had the western skillet ham, green peppers onion hash browns, eggs and cheese it was scrumptious. And the grits were creamy, perfectly cooked deliciousness! The only 2 small issues I had were our waitress had a hard time understanding questions we asked because of a language barrier. And the driveway is CRAZY hard to get into the restaurant sits up on a hill crossing Monroe road is dangerous and then the dip on the way up can cause serious drag on the bottom of your car. I still highly recommend eating here you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Never disappoint it ... everything I try in this wonderful place is delicious. Prices are the best for what kind of server and food you getting. Quality is one of the biggest concern of them I would said. Customer service is excellent is the only restaurant were the manager spend 100% of his time in the floor with the customers and helping the servers .. Love it !"}
{"text":"We've tried Stacks for both breakfast and lunch. We've gone back and forth on thumbs up and thumbs down and after our last visit have decided that in the future we'll be less picky about the table location and more picky about which waiter/waitress we have. There are two, one woman and one man, who are amazing and get it right and are on top of things. There are others who, let's just be nice and say they are NOT on top of things.   My husband was in the mood for traditional breakfast food at 7:30 in the morning...but when I saw they had pastitsio...nothing else was going to fit the bill. So that's what I got and wowza...it was amazing...featured in future dreams level of amazing. The custardy bechamel sauce was blanketed over perfectly seasoned beef and a layer of pasta without it being a heavy pasta dish. It was hot without being a volcano in my mouth and enough for two meals. Served with a Greek side salad and that was dressed perfectly!  The eggs and sausage my husband ordered were spot on. The kitchen knows how to craft eggs over medium...to many let them sit on the flat top too long. Not Stacks...they were both fabulously done!  His meal came with bread and he opted for rye. Thick cut, double toasted and seeded perfection. You can buy loaves of their amazing breads to take home as well.   The owners are very nice and personable and active participants, not just observing and barking to the staff.   While the location may not scream out quality food and fabulous menu......what comes out on the plate surely does!  Give them a try and be prepared to wait....but it's well worth the time!"}
{"text":"Stacks is a great family friendly restaurant with awesome breakfast. I like to go during the week when it is less busy because it can get very crowded on the weekends. Their food is reasonably priced and delicious.  They have a yogurt crunch bowl with fresh fruit, granola, honey, and greek yogurt. It is soooo good! They also have some great breakfast specials for under 6 dollars that come with a drink and either sausage or bacon.   My only complaint is the booths.  So uncomfortable, especially if someone is sitting in the booth behind you.  The backs must be loose or something because every time the person behind you moves you get knocked forward. They really should fix the seating."}
{"text":"This place was very busy when we got there on a Saturday at 10am! There was a 15 min wait but we decided to sit at the bar. I wouldn't sit there again though. We got subpar service at the bar. I had to flag someone down to refill my coffee and she rolled her eyes at me even though I apologized 3 times. The food took a little longer than I thought it would but it wasn't an unreasonable amount of time. The other waitresses coming through the bar area were very nice. I didn't like looking at their messy drink station but oh well. The food was DELICIOUS. They give you a lot of food for sure. My florentine eggs Benedict was so good. I loved the mushrooms at the bottom. The hollandaise sauce wasn't the best but the rest of it made up for it. We got two meals and a coffee and spent around $20. I'm sure if we sat somewhere else I would have been more happy with the service, but we were too hungry to wait."}
{"text":"We have tried Stack numerous times. Food is good but service is lacking!!   I work 5 mins from there so we love getting orders to go. I think on the 6-8 times in the last 6 months they have yet to get out order right (usually missing a couple food items we ordered). So do yourself a favor, check the order before you leave. And just know they older lady up front will be pissy with you for doing it!   Once we went Saturday morning ... Very!!! busy. We tried to be patient. I watched 2 waitresses (one was ours) seem to be unsure about orders in their hands. They set order down 3 tables away and walked away. The patrons looked confused & she came back & picked up the plates. Made a circle round through the kitchen & then to my table. When I told her, she suddenly couldn't speak good English. We told lady when we pd she said that I was seeing things & My order came from the kitchen. She said the waitresses wouldn't do that. Never confronted the waitresses - just told me I was wrong.    Breakfast is hot & fresh. Pancakes are a little bland. They have ham & cheese club at lunchtime - YUM!!  We always share - its huge. Just know service is going to be mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Late Saturday morning. Very busy. Fairly noisy. Host was rude-ish on phone and at seating. Our waiter was mildly impatient but very attentive and efficient. Food preparation took a while but was declared delicious by all -steak & eggs, eggs, omelette & chocolate waffles, bacon & hash browns and bumped up review from 3 to 4 stars. Overall, good little diner even if the staff could be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Warning- don't try to get in after 8:45 or 9 on the weekends.  I usually have a skillet breakfast.  The veggies are diced fine and are delicious. Service is consistently good.  The bread is made there and the toast absolutely melts in your mouth.  They serve butter in tiny paper cups, very fresh, instead of in packs.  The pancakes and French toast look good, they have a gluten free option usually. They have a bakery case that I always mean to try something from- last time I saw piña colada cheesecake. One of the owners/managers is young with dark eyes and is very dashing and attractive."}
{"text":"French toast (Regular, Stuffed, or berry) is out of this world. Everything else that I've eating there is great too! People are always friendly and family-like. Much bigger than the Waxhaw location but both locations have great staff! Must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! My boyfriend enjoyed the Western Skillet with orange juice and a side of fruit. I enjoyed the short stack of pancakes with coffee and a side of sausage links. The service was excellent and prices were reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just went here with my mom for breakfast. I got the stacks French toast. Holy cow it's good! Got an order of hashbrowns on the side. The lady asked me if I wanted them crispy. Hell no! I was so glad she asked. Service was fine and we didn't get attitude from anyone. To be fair we went at 10:45 am on a Thursday. I don't get to this side of the country often but I intend to come back here."}
{"text":"Are you searching for the best place to have breakfast in southeast Charlotte/ Matthews area? Well look no further than Stacks Kitchen. Where to begin???? How about the stuffed French toast that is so light and fluffy and the most generous portion you will ever find. The omelettes that will feed a family of four ;) kidding but not its huge and filled with fresh veggies, savory meats and cheeses. Fresh squeezed OJ anyone? Why yes, they make it to order. The salads are full of greens and an assortment of vegetables. The service is friendly, quick and spot on always. They never seem frazzled even though they're almost always busy. You must try it to believe how yummy the food is.... last but not least THE Fresh Pastries at the counter, WOW, cakes, cookies, pies, baklava, breads OH MY!!!"}
{"text":"A top Charlotte breakfast!  Large portions, breads and pastries baked onsite, innovative food like stuffed french toast and skillets, great prices, and really attentive staff. A Charlotte culinary gem hidden in plain site!"}
{"text":"Stacks Kitchen in Matthews is a Diner off of Monroe Rd and HWY 51. The food is consistently delicious, so expect a wait if you go on the weekend. There is a classic Diner counter to eat at if you don't want to wait. I share the Lumberjack with my daughter, fills up both of us! The Challah french toast is mmm. The bacon is thick, crispy and juicy, always in heaven. The fresh squeezed OJ is pricier than the other juices, but, it's worth the splurge. After my meal I am ready for a nap! Happy and full it takes me a minute to remember the waitress says to pay our check at the register. Conveniently, we always pass the bakery on the way and can get pastries for later and pay for both at the door. It's a genius layout for them to have."}
{"text":"This is very popular, their motto is \"great food and a lot of it\" which is not normally a positive, but I think that might give you an idea. It's good diner food, menu is a million miles long and they have daily specials. They are Greek owned and only have a few Greek foods, their mousaka is there daily and is fantastic and much more reasonably priced than Greek restaurants. Their pancakes, egg dishes, amazing stuffed French toast.. All very good for this kind of diner place.. Kids adore it."}
{"text":"I can't begin to say how good this place is. We came on a Saturday morning around 9am and it was super busy. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait and that was very accurate. Every minute of that wait was worth it. I'm a super coffee brat and found theirs was very tasty. I ended up choosing one of their skillet dishes that I found to be excellent. It came with a pancake that was great as well. It was a ton of food for a really good price. The service and management went the extra mile to ensure our experience was great. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Shame that the only review for this place is someone griping about the price of eggs.  Me and my wife can be very picky, but this is one of the better places we have tried since coming to NC.  The place is well decorated and spotless, they were very busy but efficient, and the food was great. I had stuffed french toast covered in fresh fruit, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything was well presented and tasted great.  The waitress was very friendly and enthusiastic, and I would guess that in a land of few options, these guys will be king, by the time we left the line was getting huge, so I guess you should expect a wait during prime times, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about Stacks. It's a family owned diner with breakfast and lunch. It's usually pretty busy, but I've never had an unreasonable wait time. I first moved to Charlotte in August and my mom and I had breakfast before she headed back home from helping me settle in. We had coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, pancakes and the eggs Benedict. We were full and satisfied!  Now when anyone comes to visit me from out of town, I make sure to squeeze in a breakfast at Stacks. I have since ordered the traditional breakfast meal (super cheap), the low fat wrap, and the big daddy skillet- ALL DELISH. You've got to give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a morning breakfast before work as it serves family style. The service was friendly and the food yummy. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese kaiser sandwich and she got the french toast. The bread was tasty and fresh. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"THE best diner breakfasts in the area. Love the biscuits and the corn beef hash was real corn beef! Great flavor and I love their hash browns -fantastic.  My daughter is vegan and had fresh spinach with onions and mushrooms over the hash browns.  Challah french toast with fresh berries and cream. Loved the desserts but too full to try - will bring home cookies next time! Or coconut cake :)"}
{"text":"Diner like comfort food. I have been several times for breakfast and also a couple of lunches. Food good. Service good. Never had to wait."}
{"text":"Sunday I got in of those moods for French toast but decided to avoid the brunch crowd. Monday at 1 pm I sit at the counter,  there's only two other customers and both had already finished eating. I order eggs and French toast - a 5 minute job for any short order cook - and wait. And wait and wait.   Twenty five minutes later the restaurant has emptied out, I've had all the coffee I could stomach and still no food. Sometimes an order falls between the cracks, it happens. I tell the waitress to check and she tells me it's coming out \"soon\"   Then she spends the next 20 minutes going back and forth to check in the kitchen and repeating to me soon, soon soon  - meaning they hadn't even started my order yet.   Well, at least the woman  tried. Forty five minutes was all I could take, I told her \"maybe next time\", got up and left.   To be honest reading the labels of the so called \"jam\" containers while I waited didn't help my mood:   High Fructose corn syrup and corn syrup are the two main ingredients      www.smuckers.com/products/ProductDetail.aspx?groupId=1&categoryId=15&flavorId=24"}
{"text":"Wednesday mornings are not too busy. Service was great and the veggie quesadilla was plentiful and tasty. A clean friendly place. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place, but the extremely long waits for food and the lack of menu originality will not give you any reason to come back. Try it once to see if you like it, but don't expect this to become a favorite."}
{"text":"This homey restaurant located in the heart of Matthews is home to some of the best breakfast food in Matthews. As soon as I entered, I was met with some of the friendliest service. It was like southern hospitality was embedded in the staff. I had the breakfast special, 2 eggs with bacon and hash browns, and also French toast. It was perfect!  The French toast was fluffy and delicious. I do plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"After driving past this place several times my husband and I finally woke up early enough tia eat away for a quick breakfast date.  At 9:30 in the morning the place was packed!  We had attempted to go on another occasion but saw the line and left. I this day we decided to wait and only waited for about 20 minutes.  Honestly from the outside or street it doesn't look like my hand givens the name could easily be mistaken for a strip club... There are no windows.  They offer typical diner fare and an abundance of pastries and fresh squeezed juice.  The juice is sweet... Almost suspiciously sweet.  The service was fast like you would expect in a diner.  The food was ok... What you would expect in a diner but nothing mind blowing.  I'm guessing the long lines are more because there aren't any other diner type places in the area but again, it wasn't bad.  I personally wouldn't wait in line to go there but if you are into diners with ok food and LARGE portions, Stacks is a go to."}
{"text":"Always busy and packed. Very good food and service. Everything seems very fresh and the only reason for 1 less star is because it is a bit on the costly side, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"Last time there, 4 months ago, the lines were very long and the food was terrific but service a bit slow. Went back today. No line. A/C not working. Food delivery took a long time. Eggs waaay overdone, biscuits stale, chicken Philly sandwich with cold chicken. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great diner in the area. The pastistio was great and the Greek salad was pretty good. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. I've tried to give it a chance. But it's just not good. The food has no flavor. Do not order the hash browns. They lack any flavor or salt. The portions are extremely large, but who wants a large portion of flavorless food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I couldn't believe how cheap the prices were, but the food matched them - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, per se. The fella and I got a super early start one Sunday, and Stacks was on our way out of town. They opened at 7:00, and we got there at 7:15 - good thing since the lines can be long based on the other reviews. There were 3 cop cars in the parking lot, and I figured the cops must know what's up, so we were excited.  It's definitely a down home kitchen sort of feel, and our waitress was sweet and fantastic. Our food came out fast, too. We both got the traditional breakfast with basic meat ($5.95 each) but did it totally different - I got bacon, scrambled eggs, wheat toast, and hash browns, and he got sausage patties (they have links, too), over-medium eggs, a biscuit, and grits. He said everything was just as you'd expect, about average. My bacon was so tough that I didn't even eat all 3 strips, which is a rarity for me, and the hash browns didn't have much taste to them. The eggs and toast were good, but it's pretty hard to mess up eggs and toast."}
{"text":"We had gone to Stacks several times, but hadn't eaten there because there was a line, and we don't wait in restaurant lines. We finally ate there today, and it was a great experience. I had the breakfast special which included two eggs, hash browns, sausage, toast and coffee for $4.95. Unbelievable. My wife had waffles with bananas and walnuts. Her meal included bacon and coffee for $6.95. The food was delicious and our server (Nicole) was spot on - attentive without being intrusive. We will definitely return (on a weekday)."}
{"text":"Went here based of my parents' recommendations. At 12:30 on a Sunday, it was busy and they were running a 10-15 minute wait which really turned into 20-25 or so. We were seated in the side room which didn't have the vibe the rest of the diner had. It had old chairs and an ugly brown wall.   We ordered food immediately after being seated. I got a burger, my mom a salad, and my dad breakfast. Food came out fairly quickly, and here's where it all fell apart for me. My burger was downright mediocre. The cheese tasted (and looked) so processed and it killed the whole burger. The patty was nothing special. The fries were average. Mom and dad reported liking theirs, so maybe I just picked a bad item on the menu (although a diner should not mess burgers up).  Service was good. The waitresses called everybody honey just like you'd expect in the South. Nothing else was notable about lunch. I would give this place 2 stars, but I'll add the third for 2/3 of our meals being good."}
{"text":"wow - don't miss the Spinach Pie and Greek Salad for lunch - it was great! the service felt a little slower than I expected, but it was worth it. one thing to be aware of, my grandson ordered peanut butter and jelly, and it was toasted - which I thought was odd. just be aware and if you don't want it toasted, just let them know."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte and I don't even live in Charlotte. I used to live here and I wish it was here when I did. This is a classic diner the food is amazing the bread and cookies are all homemade on site and worth a trip from Raleigh to bring some home. The burger was probably one of the five best burgers I've ever had.  You can tell that the people who own this place really care about making good food and making their customers happy. I bought a coffee mug just so I can think about it when I'm sipping my coffee back here in Raleigh with no restaurant whatsoever like this."}
{"text":"Amazing food :-) the wait was worth it! We stared in awe at the dessert case! A cheesecake that caught our eye was calling our name (Cannoli Cheesecake ) unfortunately when we ordered it at the end of our meal it was all gone... The Manager came by to notify us that they had run out (didnt get his name but he noticed i had taken a picture lol) he offered us a Napoleon instead on him which was truly amazing! (Didn't get a picture due to that we dove right in) Great Staff! Everyone in Charlotte is so friendly! We will be back when we move from California to Charlotte in a month if all goes well! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Better than IHOP by far! Homemade everything with a huge variety to choose from! Great quality, great quantity, and great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent place fantastic staff. Very clean and friendly! This place is our regular breakfast hang out. Great prices and everyone knows us which we like!!  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on Stacks while in Matthews for another appointment. I only ordered food to go but the hostess was very kind and helpful. I noticed most people weren't waiting long before they were called to be seated as well. So that's a major plus if you do sit down. I got the basic French toast short stack....OMG....this is the best French toast I have ever tasted. I also had the south of the border omelette and it was delicious as well. The food is great and from my wait for the food, the staff was awesome too."}
{"text":"Great food, wide variety , awesome service ! Stacks is very clean also which is a definite plus !"}
{"text":"Great food. Tasty, lots of choices and more than we could eat.  Gluten free toast or French toast available.  Would be my favorite go to place for breakfast if I lived closer.  That says it all."}
{"text":"Do I love Stacks? Do chickens lay eggs on the north east side of the Appalachian trail? The answer is a big fat YES! Stacks is just easy. It has a great menu and a great staff. My absolute favorite meal is their French toast. It has a little bit of \"you'll come back for more\" seasoning in it, but my goodness you'll think you're in French toast heaven whilst dining on these delicious slices of magic. The wait time can be a bit extreme on  the weekends but I mean, it's Stacks, so yeah, You deal. If you're a resident of the Matthews area and have not yet been here. Shame on you. Go now."}
{"text":"We finally checked out Stacks this weekend for a late breakfast. They were on a pretty long wait (45 minutes I believe) but they said the bar was first come, first served. We didn't score a seat up there, so we waited quite a while. The hostess brought around pound cake and offered to get us drinks while we were waiting; I thought that was a nice extra.   The inside is really nice and bright - we went to one of the previous restaurants here  years ago and it is totally different inside. They even had some nice Charlotte artwork!  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive - told us about how great everything on the menu was and how all the breads and most of the sweets are made in house (a couple items are brought in from Carnegie Deli in NY!).   Both of our meals were delicious and GIANT! We tried one of the skillets and an omelette (or is it omelet?) - seriously, they were both huge. I couldn't even finish mine!   Overall, this is a great spot to get breakfast and potentially lunch! Just don't go in starving, the place is very popular and you will most likely have to wait."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast places, this might just be the best option in Charlotte.  There are multiple locations.  The menu is filled with a variety of creative options.  Today, I could have chosen pumpkin pancakes or other exotic high carb dishes, but I went for the Sanibel omelette with egg whites.   It was filled with portabella mushrooms, cheese, and tomatoes.  Grits and wheat toast rounded out the meal.   Stacks knows what they are doing.   Good value.    Solid at everything.    Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food, local feel and wonderful price point! Good for families, serve breakfast all day. Also have GF options"}
{"text":"We eat here once or twice a month.  Every time my mom visits, I know we'll eat here once for breakfast.  Two people can get a traditional eggs breakfast and have French toast (stuffed or fruit)  for under $20.  It holds us over well into the evening.  The manager we always see is nice and caring.  The host guy with glasses is friendly and professional.  The restaurant is always clean and full of light.  Always busy but seated as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Served my hash browns crispy as ordered but got dinged For playing 'how great thou art' on the sound system whilst I was eating."}
{"text":"This is the sister of the Waxhaw store and it is just a delicious. We brought my sister, who has never been and she said it was excellent french toast also. I don't usually order French toast but the one here is just special. The waiter was nice enough to warm up my syrup too the way I like it so extra kudos to him. The glass of fresh squeezed juice is also special so a good breakfast was had by all."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Had the Challah French Toast and it was excellent! Service was perfect, attentive but not hovering. The prices are very reasonable- check the specials. The only downside, and it was minimal was the coffee. A little on the bland side. That aside, we've found a new breakfast hangout. We'll try lunch next."}
{"text":"I love breakfast at this place. I don't usually write reviews but these guys deserve to be recognized."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from Maine and heard great things about Stacks.  My wife is all about breakfast anytime so it was definitely a place we had to check out!  The place is really warm and inviting.  The staff is friendly and the menu has something for everyone.  My wife had the banana nut waffle and a side of bacon.  I had a special on this Wednesday, the Southwest Chicken & Waffle.  So look, I realize I'm a New England guy moving to the south and I might be punched for saying this but I'm not a big sausage gravy fan.  That said, the chicken and waffles I had was really different.  The chicken was smothered in a chorizo sausage gravy topped with dried cranberries.  It was INCREDIBLE.  I love chorizo anyway and the spice complimented the waffle and syrup really well.  The waffle itself was simple and well executed.  My wife is typically a slow eater and she demolished her waffle and bacon in record time.  We'll be back, possibly as early as tomorrow for cinnamon buns to go.  They're the size of a your head!  There's a local diner we love in our hometown, and Stacks might be our new go-to in our new city."}
{"text":"It was good to know that theres a change of pace spot for breakfast. Stacks is another breath of fresh air b/c there's not that many good breakfast establishments that Im willing to frequent and stacks fits the billing. The skillets and omelets as well as the waffles were fresh and hot and worth and return tomorrow."}
{"text":"on a quest to find best breakfast in the charlotte area.  Stacks stacks up well with amazing French toast."}
{"text":"This place is very average I came here once for breakfast it wasn't worth any of the money honestly or the long wait to be seated the food was bland"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch. Well priced and as close to a real diner as you will get in the south. Very friendly staff and the food was delicious. They also gave out bakery samples while you waited for your table....try the corn bread!! I had a chicken club sandwich that was awesome and my husband had a breakfast sandwich both were really tasty. Even though it was very busy the manager came by and checked on us which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"First time here and I love this place!  Everyone including the patrons are super nice!  I ordered steak, eggs, and grits.  All were delicious!  My friend and I sat down to wait for a table.  While we waited, they passed out pieces of yummy cornbread.    Two seats at the bar freed up, so we snagged those seats instead.  Waitress at the bar was quick to take our drink orders and super attentive.  Empty dishes were also cleared off of the eating area very quickly.  There was also a man in a white shirt who walked around to make sure everything was great.    Food came out quickly and we enjoyed every bit of it.  The only complaint I have is that parking was scarce today.  It might be better to park away from this lot and walk over to the restaurant during its busy hours.  I will definitely be returning here soon.  If you're in town for a football game, this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I ate an omelet as big as my head and enjoyed a biscuit (I will always love a biscuit, but these were especially good). I'm definitely trying the French toast next time!"}
{"text":"Good food. Plenty of room, very spacious. Very friendly staff and owners. Get the big daddy skillet only if you're very very hungry!"}
{"text":"Stacks is a great place to get breakfast or brunch.  We have been there several times and plan to go back.  They have a unique menu with plenty of options to choose from.  They have delicious looking desserts too, but we haven't tried any of them.  We take all of our visiting guests here and they love it too.  The portions are quite large, sometimes we take home leftovers yummmm.  The prices are reasonable and the owners are incredibly kind and welcoming.  The waitstaff is punctual and will recommend dishes to you if you can't decide.  I love their little high top bar, they list specials on board above it which is really nice.  It gets really and I mean REALLY busy on the weekends, so you have to beat the rush of weekend crowds.  I love the skillets and the french toast.  My cousin had the eggs Benedict and  she ate the entire thing, and she is tiny.  So she definitely loved it.  It's a hidden gem in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"Diner-esque place in a little strip mall that has an interesting menu with various offerings. There was a bit of a wait when we came in around 11:30am on a Sat, but we circumvented the 20-30min wait by going to the counter which is open seating.   The waitress we had was nice and came to get our drink orders quickly, but then it took a while for her to come back and take our food orders. It took a ridiculously long time for us to get our food! Seriously, over 30mins...and this was after I asked our waitress twice to check on our food. The first time she just forgot, which was after about 20mins, the second time, which was just at 30mins, she said it would still be a few more mins. These were not complicated orders, so the wait time for the food was disappointing. I hate waiting for food, especially when there is no reason for the exorbitant wait time. This is breakfast, not steaks or souffles.   As for the quality, it was fine. Nothing amazing. I had the florentine benedict and the hollandaise was decent. I will say, you do get a lot of food with your breakfast order. With my benedict I got a side of grits and english muffins. The grits were pretty tasty, but I think it is a felony if you mess up grits this far into the South.  It also took a ridiculously long time for the waitress to process our payment. The card was sitting on the counter a full 10mins before we finally had to tell the waitress it was there, even though she literally passed by it a number of times. Even then, she had someone else process it...so they may need to work on their time management for food delivery & payment processing. Because even if the food were exemplary, the time it took to get it and pay for it was ridiculous and definitely affected the enjoyment of the meal."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good breakfast & reasonably priced. Arrive early or you'll be waiting quite awhile. The line is always out the door on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Breakfast?!?  Yes, Please!  I'm glad Matthews has a place like Stacks, serving up breakfast and lunch items.  Any place that hails, \"BREAKFAST ANYTIME\" on their menu is going to be an instant winner for me.  Located in a pretty un-assuming strip mall at the corner of Monroe and HWY 51, the Stacks Matthews location can definitely get busy.  There is usually a wait for a table, but it is indeed worth it and a great sign that they are serving so many people and the food speaks for itself.  This place is always super clean the the staff - although running around, are super super nice.  I love the banter between the staff and the regulars.  They will always find time for you even though the place is slammed.  Props to a place that does fresh squeezed orange juice.  It is done by a machine, but you can watch the process up-close-and-personal since the juicer is displayed as soon as you walk in.  Along with a great display case of desserts and treats."}
{"text":"Good food, good price, owner is always really nice! We try to come here about once per week and are never disappointed! The Popeyes skillet was great and the breakfast special for $5 is always a go to!  Favorite breakfast place in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere been here about 5 times within last year and it's always been a pleasure"}
{"text":"When the worst thing about a restaurant is the constant long wait to get a table that's a good thing. Stacks is a pretty straightforward meat and potatoes diner. There's nothing fancy about it but it had good prices, solid consistent food, and friendly, efficient service. Come early to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Sat down asked for our server no problem.   Host put menus on the table ,table had not been cleaned . Yuk   Then walked away. Our waitress took care of that after we told her. (She is busy and all over the place) Excellant waitress always .  Ordered roast turkey club as last I had it was roasted turkey. This time it's kind of like lunch meat turkey deli sliced. No Pickle they ran out. As my granddaughter had a skillet loaded with hash browns.   Getting the chicken orzo soup to go for the wife.   No napkins  other than the ones wrapping the silverware.  Today I am not really pleased with everything.    Be a while before I return.   Update better service and food. Waitress great owner great came along way.   Stick with your favorite waiter or waitress"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was welcoming and homey. The staff greeted you with a smile and made you feel welcome. After being seated the staff quickly started their service. The fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome I love pulp so if you don't, stay away from the fresh squeezed. My daughter and mother ordered the pancakes and they loved them. They were light and fluffy very homemade. My other daughter ordered fresh toast it wasn't as good as the pancakes and nothing like New Jersey dinners. There are other places with better french toast. The egg batter wasn't soaked in enough by the bread. I ordered the two eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The bacon was very good a little salty but good. The eggs wasn't nothing exciting they were eggs. The hash hashbrown however is a different story I will never order them again. Our overall experience was awesome I would recommend this place I will just order something different the next time."}
{"text":"Yes we liked it and we would go back again. The food was very good and the portions pretty descent at a reasonable price. Service was good, the manager seemed to be involved in every aspect of the restaurant including welcoming the regulars, he stopped by our table to check that everything was ok, I always like that :) The only reason why I didn't give them a fifth star is because of the wait on the food, they told us 30 min for a party of 5 and they gave us a nice booth but once sitting we waited a long time for the food. But yes we recommend it, worth the wait."}
{"text":"Um, no.  I ordered your basic, can't screw it up two over medium, ham, hash browns, and buttered toast.  I get two eggs that are oily and kind of on the noticeably small side.  The ham I'm told is their \"tailored ham\".?.  I didn't want country ham and this was the only alternative.  It's basically like very thinly shaved spam, griddle fried in oil.  It was hideous looking and terrible tasting.  Wow- bad.  My pile of hash browns were dry and tasteless.  The \"toast\" was actually a slice of rigid bread, toasted with no butter; I had to apply that myself.    This is the 2nd time I've tried this place and neither visit felt like a value for my money.  The floor was shiny... and the server was efficient... but the food wasn't good :-("}
{"text":"We enjoyed Stack's! My spinach pie with a Greek salad on the side was a misnomer bc the salad was huge! Both were good, too! My parents got turkey & veggies that were pretty good & my dtr got the corned beef hash (more like just corned beef; not so good) & French toast...it was made on Challah bread & was so Thick that it made it more bready than anything. Good tea! Good service. But 3 out of 4 spoons were Dirty! Good meal, but not running back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. If you have not eaten here or are considering eating here it is highly recommended. The food is always excellent, never greasy with their breakfast foods and the service is great. The prices are great for the quality food you receive!"}
{"text":"I have been to this building on numerous occasions, but mostly for lunch during working hours when it was (previously) a Chinese buffet of one sort or another. Since it turned into Stacks, it's a little more challenging to get over, most especially due to their lengthy lines, so it was most often relegated to weekend duty.  On one such weekend, we came over, and happened to find that the lines were not actually as long as feared. The wait was only a few minutes, we were seated and promptly had to figure out what to eat - we thought we would have a longer period while waiting to browse a menu. Go figure.  The good news is that there are plenty of options, and you get a good-sized breakfast-type meal for your dollar(s) here. You should not come away hungry. The slightly-disappointing news is that their offerings are not all that surprising. You can find similar food at most diner-type places, and if you go somewhere like Waffle House, you will usually not have to wait even those 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Today's experience was very saddening. It all started with dirty silverware and was followed up by a very mediocre quality meal. Normally stacks is my favorite place to grab breakfast but the past few times I have eaten here the food and service has been way below the norm."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago for the first time so for brunch with some friends. Super busy, which I personally take as a good sign. Food was amazing and service was OK. I would recommend stacks to my friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4 stars for this little nugget! Visiting from Atlanta and found this place. We were amazed at the traffic coming through this place from the time you pull into the parking lot, the place is congested so be patient because you will probably circle the parking lot a few times to find a spot. We waited about 30min for 2 people for breakfast on a Saturday and it was worth it...it's probably wise to have someone from your party hop out and put your name on the list while you're circling the lot!   Okay on to the food...I had a basic breakfast with grits, hash browns, sausage and a biscuit. Of course I didn't finish it all because they definitely give you diner sized portions but it was solid. My friend had the corned beef hash with grits and she LOVED it so it's definitely a must for hash lovers! My advice is to share a meal of you and your party have the same taste otherwise enjoy!"}
{"text":"About a year back, I happened to drive through Waxhaw stopped for breakfast at the original Stacks Kitchen.  Now here was a reason to move to Waxhaw: a good menu, breakfast all day, fair prices, and a bakery case!  I was hooked and from that point on, if I was in Waxhaw around breakfast or lunch, Stacks is where I'd grab a meal.    So when I drove down Monroe Road and saw their coming soon banner, I was pretty excited.  Matthews doesn't have a good diner.  You might say what about have cracker-barrel and IHOP but eat a breakfast at Stacks and you'll never go back to those chains.    The inside is a mix of booths, tables, and even a bar to eat at.  The bar is first-come basis and with the exception of peak times on the weekend, there's always a spot available.  Service is great but like any great cult-eatery, they get busy so things do slow down.  I'd rather have slower service and good food than the trash on a plate found at the chains.  The food is incredible.  The baked goods and desserts are made in-house as well as their fresh-squeezed juicer.  They are fantastic and many of the breakfast meals come with their bread as toast.  Breakfast is my favorite whether its a large fluffy omelets or the waffle piled high with fruit.  Plus it's served all day...(which ends at 3pm for them).  The sandwiches (BLT, Turkey and Ham, etc) are stacked high like they're challenging you to take it all in one big food-coma inducing bite.  Make sure you save room for dessert as you're forced to stroll by their display case filled with cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, and canoli's - which is cruel and unusual punishment if you're stuffed up to your eyeballs.  That's ok - get it and take it home."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant for breakfast. I had the waffles with bananas and pecans and it was delicious. The waffle was soft and not hard around the edges. The bananas were freshly sliced and not brown or overly ripe. The pecans were toasted and lightly covered with brown sugar and cinnamon. I would definitely order this again. My friend had the short Stacks pancakes, one egg and a turkey sausage. The eggs looked a little too hard but maybe she liked them that way. The pancakes were medium side and she seems to enjoy eating them. She couldn't finish all three so she took half home. My son had a chicken wrap, of which I tasted, and it was soooo good. He and I both said it was one of the best chicken wraps we have had at all the restaurants we have eaten. The chicken was well seasoned, baked and tender. It was huge! He ordered a large glass of freshly squeezed O.J., which I had to at least taste it! lol. Another win!  Can't wait to take my husband when we are back in Charlotte and my other friend. I know they will both enjoy the food.  We had to wait about 30-40 minutes but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"They have great diner style food! It's also great that you can order on door dash, which is great for Sunday lazy mornings!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast - great service.  Crowded on weekend mornings but worth the wait.  I've been here twice so far and been happy with my breakfast."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is less than a mile from our house and we are just now getting around to going to it!!  When we walked in on a Sunday, I knew we were going to wait!  It seemed really crowded, but we waited only about 10 minutes.  The server and hostess were so friendly and walked around offering little bites for people to munch on while we were waiting.  We also wandered over to the homemade dessert case, which looked amazing!!    We tried a few of the things on the menu.  I had the Popeye skillet and let me tell you, the portions are HUGE!  I was absolutely stunned that a breakfast that cost 7.25 was that insanely large.  It comes served on its own little cast iron skillet with diced potatoes, topped with sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinach, and topped with scrambled eggs with cheese!  I am a huge fan of breakfast joints, and this local eatery did NOT disappoint!  We will definetly be back here and sometime in the not so distant future.  #allthebreakfastfood"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, great staff. Food service is a bit slow, but that's likely due to the huge menu and busy diner - not a terrible problem to have. I got the big daddy skillet, and it was delicious, but I couldn't eat all of it. For $10,it was a ton of food. And their orange juice is amazing. I love fresh squeezed orange juice as opposed to store bought, and you can taste the different here. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Come here on a weekend and you will be sure to wait. However this is just a sure sign that the food will be delicious. The place is family run and the service is great. Always nice to see the same faces. I've tried several items from the menu and they have never disappointed. Cannot go wrong with eggs Benedict. Great place for breakfast, brunch, or lunch! Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second (and last visit) to Stacks.  My first visit was fantastic a few months ago.  This visit should have really gotten zero stars.....because from start to finish it bombed.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars this go around is because the food actually tasted good.  We arrived at 10:08 on a Saturday morning.  Put our names on the list and were told that it would be a 25 minute wait.  (We waited outside...and they were calling parties from the wait list outside too). 40 minutes later, after not being called....i walked in and looked at the wait list at the hostess stand.  Our name had already been marked off....and so had the next 7 or 8 people after us.  When I said something....the waitress admitted that she forgot to call us and take us to the table.  We were then seated immediately.  When we were seated...it took a other 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a waitress who seemed dazed and confused.  We heard her apologize to several tables around us....and I thought to myself \"this can't be good\".   She got our drink order and eventually showed up with that....then made us wait another 5 minutes or so (after disappearing) to come take our order.  Something told me that I should ask her not to forget to put our order in....but I didnt.  That was a BAD CALL......because, guess what?.   SHE FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN.  People seated after us had already gotten food and eaten and ready to go.  Not us.  I asked to speak to the manager and shared our experience with him.  He listened and was polite enough.....and he said \"hold on for a minute and let me go check on something\".   That took a while....i was wondering if he left to check the back door so he could run away.  He returned to our table with a plate of Greek goodies and some dried bagel chips to help smooth things over with us.  To me, that was not enough.    I am a hairstylist. .. and if anyone has ever had a bad experience or complained....i would take care of a portion of their ticket.  What he offered me was like the equavalent of offering my clients a few salon magazines and some K-Cups for them to take when they left.  Kinda insulting.  When we got to the cash register to pay....we had to wait again.  No cashier to be seen anywhere.  When she asked \"How was everything?\"  She seemed shocked at my reply of \"You asked the wrong person that question this morning....cause it bombed from start to finish.\"       By the time we left it was 11:55.  Almost 2 hours later.  That's too long for any breakfast service  I am sorry that my second experience was so dumpy....because I really liked the food.....but I would never subject myself to this type of experience ever again."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and that's why we came back three times. However, the service SUCKS! I am standing here on a 40 minute line while there are 5 empty tables for at least 15 minutes. Then there is waitress who has forgotten what we've ordered every time we've been back, which she excuses by saying that the kitchen is too busy.  This place tries our patience a d unless they improve soon, we will not be back, no matter how good the food is.  And here is another gem: we were just sat down and were told to expect to be served slowly because the kitchen is backed up. Seriously? Who does this?"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The atmosphere was inviting, clean and friendly staff. Full menu all day and the food was to die for. We had heard about this place before, from the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you walk in you know you are about to have fresh made high quality food. I ordered the egg Benedict and I have never had a hollandise sauce that tasted this good. They also had their own fresh made bread for sale. My husbands patty melt was wonderful. The meat was cooked perfect and not greasy. I really cannot wait to go back and try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"We LOVE Stacks! It is our go to choice when we want a great breakfast. Service has always been outstanding. My three year old wore a birthday crown in on his birthday. The owners & staff made a huge deal out of it & made him feel really special. They put a candle in his pancakes & gave him cookies as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Had Stacks for breakfast the other day for the third time and I must say they are always consistent. The bacon and eggs with hash browns and whole wheat toast was what I ordered this time and it was very good! The eggs were done exactly the way I wanted them, the bacon was nice and thick, and the hash browns were seasoned perfectly, it all tasted very fresh and the price was fantastic! I will be back to try something else soon."}
{"text":"I recently tried this restaurant and wasn't a big fan. The hostess that was young with the dark hair, was very rude. The food was ok. I am glad that I tried this well known place to see what the rave was all about but I would never go back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here.  Sat at the counter and hand an awesome experience. I believe my servers name was Angie.  She was extremely pleasant.  I will be back with my wife asap.   How can you beat $4.95 for all this food! B"}
{"text":"Honestly when i hit up breakfast joint I dont expect much. You get your standard two eggs and meat and it all taste the same. This place was a bit different. I ordered the eggs with sausage patty and my brother got the links. It was definitely more than 2 eggs. The patties were nice and big, and was not dry at all. The links were chode links, not the regular grocery store links(check pictures). It was impressive. Granted it was a dollar or two more expensive than other breakfast joints, but it was worth it for the quality meats. Service was great people kept stopping by to make sure we were taken care of. There may be a wait for breakfast and brunch. Get there early. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait-very popular place with the office and elderly lunch crowd . Be prepared to wait for your food too. Typical huge menu that you'd find at greek eateries in NYC or Chicago. Food was good and plentiful-had a Rueben and onion rings, spanakopita, and gyro.   Averhe prices. Casual dress There is very little parking here-many of their shops have designates parking for their store only."}
{"text":"Food looks yummy, large portions , but lacked flavor. Pretty packed for business so the wait is long and the wait for food even longer . Depends on your choice of taste , I had a Florentine skillet and it had no salt , no pepper , no seasoning so I added Tabasco and ketchup . Saw a lot of people ordering lunch and the fries looked yummy , but how can you mess up fries? Stuffed French toast was bread with cream in between slices , I think my family enjoyed the bacon , but come on it's bacon . Too many yummy breakfast spots to revisit."}
{"text":"The wait staff is awesome, really friendly and helpful, the breakfast was cooked properly and the price are reasonable, the restaurant was very clean and so were the bathrooms, that's a thumbs up"}
{"text":"When this place opened we went everyday. Then you could see the poor management slide under the door from the kitchen and take a hold up front. Open tables and a 45 minuet wait, Uninspired staff, incomplete plating. Went back after 15 months. Everyone asked where had a been. Explained owner told me last year after waiting an hour for a table, giving up was OUR LOSS. I have to admit I did not once miss mediocre food with slow servce. 3 people at our table I had Mexican omelet no salsa no sour cream not even a hit of mexico, friends had same fruit waffle one covered in whipped cream other not a drop. .. The food here is simple thaw and heat from USFOOD nothing from scratch . The sad part is tit's always filled. Means no one in this area knows real food"}
{"text":"First time here and I just had a standard breakfast.  I had eggs over easy, wheat toast, and oatmeal. It was good & came out to less than $5.  Everyone was friendly. The restaurant was clean. I would like to try some lunch items next time, so stand by for more reviewing."}
{"text":"Our 1st time coming to this place  we went by the pictures of yelp to try and order our food. Now let me tell you how these people are full of it ! Look at the previously. Posted stake sandwich it's barely closing from all the meat inside of it what I got was just bread with maybe 2oz of meat I spoke to manager the wanted to charge me extra to add more to it I don't suggest  people to dine here the place is kinda dirty waiter came around only ones no napkins no refills"}
{"text":"Busy place Saturday 9 AM - a good sign. Been open a couple of months. Only serve breakfast and lunch.  Service was fast, efficient, friendly and courteous. Menu is full of great options They bake their own bread - it's great Coffee was ok Omelet was a little over cooked Grits were creamy and very tasty Applewood bacon was just right Hash browns were good Eggs cooked as requested  We will go again"}
{"text":"Yummy! After my niece's recital (she's two), we came here to have brunch. There was about a 30 minute wait with the place being slammed and tables turning quickly. This was my first time here and based on the traffic, I knew we were in for a treat. The menu is massive with all traditional breakfast, brunch, and lunch options. Salads... fruits.... pot pies, shrimp & grits, then fresh baked desserts to blow your diet. The staff is very friendly and personable. You get the feeling everyone comes here once a week and they'll know you on a first name basis in no time. The food was delicious. Everyone at my table was full and pleased with their food, especially my mom who loved her fruit bowl. It's difficult to discern from the picture, but the bowl was deep. Needless to say, my family will be making this our go to destination after my niece's dance classes."}
{"text":"I don't know what the big deal is about this place. I've gone twice and it's just average breakfast food at best. In no way is it worth the wait.  My omelet was very dry the first time and the second time I had corned beef hash which was good but nothing special. Would rate it a 2.5, but because of the wait I can say it's simply not worth it and more than likely I won't go back."}
{"text":"Well, I may only come to Stacks once in my life, but once is one more than never getting to go at all. As an out of towner it was a great all around place with plenty of American diner favorites, plus specials. Today's specials included options like canoli pancakes and Manhattan Clam Chowder. Everything we ate was delicious. Service was fast and staff were friendly. Five stars for Stack's!"}
{"text":"Place has great food with fast friendly service. By far the best corn beef hash I've ever had"}
{"text":"Extensive menu, but super crowded with no option for call-ahead. We went Sunday morning (about 10:30) and for 3 people it was a 30-40 minute wait. They desperately needed more bussers - there were a bunch of tables that just needed to be cleared off to alleviate the waiting parties. Also, we saw them seat 1 person (\"party of 1\") at a 4-person table... which helps explain the wait I guess. After we were finally seated, we gave the waiter our drink orders, and waited, and waited, and after almost 10 minutes (of watching him run around and do everything from serve food, to take orders, to even bussing a table) we finally caught his eye to ask about our drinks. He apologized and said he'd forgotten, and brought them out to us a minute later. When the food finally arrived, it was...underwhelming. Despite my \"special\" skillet dish having chorizo, onion, and peppers among other normally bold flavors, it was incredibly bland and overpowered by the hashbrowns. Another person in our group got the breakfast burrito, and he said it was actually pretty good and filling but the hash browns it came with were not very good. The other person did a customized omelete (with many of the same fillings as mine), and he described it as fine, but not something he would order again either. While there were many appealing things on the menu, our experience did not make it seem it would be worth the ordeal."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice. They make their own corned beef for their crossed need hash. Great selection of dishes!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! There was a small wait while we were, but they were offering coffee and pound cake in the lobby. The manager and our server were very personable and the service was great. The fresh squeeze orange juice is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  So to start, wait was less than 20 minutes on a Saturday morning after a car event. That was fantastic.  Service was exceptional, our waitress super sweet, with the sweetest southern accent. Constantly checking in with us and refilling our drinks when needed.  Now the food, I ordered the chocolate waffle with biscuits and gravy. The waffle was really good fluffy not overcooked.  Sausage gravy and biscuits were my favorite, delicious. Definitely have to get them.  My boyfriend ordered the stacks Lumberjack with French toast with sausage patty. The sausage patty really yummy and I don't like sausage. And his friend got the Berrylicious French toast, they both said half stack is more than enough, super thick pieces and really good.  Definitely will be back around our next time in town."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a hearty country type of breakfast place like this for a while now, one the best things is that you get breakfast at any time you walk in, It is very appealing to know you don't have a deadline. Place is small, cozy and practical.  The wait is a bit long considering the food is great and eventhough the location is lowkey you still get lots of clientele.  This place is always clean the the staff - although busy, are friendly and courteous as well as efficient and patient .  I love the banter between the staff and the regulars.  They will always find time for you even though the place is packed.  This is a rare place that does fresh squeezed orange juice.  It is done by a machine, but you can watch the process up-close since the juicer is displayed as soon as you walk in.  Along with a great display case of desserts and treats. Overall I fell in love with this place and look forward to coming here for a memorable experience every time."}
{"text":"Great lunch sandwiches. Try the Reuben. Also a good burger. Owner stopped by the table and is very friendly and the service is great. Also, the place to go for breakfast. This is a little gem you must try if you are in the neighborhood  and worth going out of your way for even if you aren't. They have Carnegie Deli desserts that are terrific flown in fresh from NY. Also, there is a little Argentinian bakery a couple of stores down that is to die for. Worth walking down there and taking home a bag of sweet goodies. And the service there is also super friendly. Stacks should serve desserts from that place in addition to their Carnegie selection. Would be good for both of the places."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast! The food is always fresh, hot and yummy! The staff are always welcoming!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and both times the food and service was outstanding. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food at VERY reasonable prices and great service too! I had a grilled chicken \"sandwich\" {without the bun and cheese} with fries. I was worried that I'd end up with a dry piece of chicken but thankfully it was really juicy and good. Hubby had a lamb gyro which he liked as well. He wanted a side of coleslaw which he usually prefers to be mayonnaisey/vinegary, but the waitress mentioned it was more sweet because the chef put his own twist on it. He was hoping to be able to try a bit before deciding whether to order it which she did she could do, but would put fries in just in case. He ended up liking it and switched to the cole slaw. Would definitely come back again and try the breakfast menu next time."}
{"text":"One visit was enough for me.  Service was a bit slow although friendly.  breakfast was not good..had an old oil taste."}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch/brunch with my daughter. Portions are large and food is good. Pancakes were very yummy! Wait staff are friendly and on top of things. I appreciated the to-go cup for my drink!"}
{"text":"Great food with plenty of it! The huge downside is a 40 minute wait to sit down, another 50 minutes to get served and the waiters are helpful and kind but are so busy you can't get a refill on your drink to save your life! Overall, I don't think I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Stacks is our favorite breakfast spot! We LOVE their delicious french toast made with thick challah bread! Not \"eggy\" tasting or greasy like some breakfast places! It's the best! Their breakfast skillet meals are also quite yummy! Plus- the kids can visit their little bakery on the way out and buy freshly made cookies for later! We also enjoy watching the owner/manager walk around and greet everyone, making sure that they enjoy their meal. Awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"I was in Matthews and looking for a place for breakfast, found this location on Yelp and thought I have never seen this location.  When I found I thought how have I never seen this.  It's tucked into a small shopping center that doesn't look like a place you would go for breakfast. When I walked inside my first thought was this is a cute little spot.  I sat down at the bar area and surprised how busy it was for a Thursday morning.  I was served quickly and the waitress was very nice.  The coffee was great, I ordered the basic breakfast scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, and bacon.  The eggs were a little over cooked, but overall the breakfast was very good.    Family owned and a nice little local spot."}
{"text":"Why not 5 stars when the food is pretty good?  Well, the food at Stacks is very good and I love the bacon (and I don't often eat bacon).  I always eat my share of pancakes and will certainly drink my share of coffee.  I am granting 4 stars because the food is good.    I will note that the seat cushions in the booths (maybe all) are in dire need of an upgrade.  They are well worn.  In addition, when someone sits in the neighboring booth (behind you), you feel every movement.  This became aggravating during my recent visit.  I switched sides with my daughter only to have someone come in 5 minutes later and sit behind me.    I would love it if they would small plate breakfasts on the weekends like they do during the week.  I really can't--and don't want to--eat all the food they bring.  And I hope they learn to keep the biscuits fresh even if it is one hour before closing."}
{"text":"Kids menu: N/A, but who needs a kids menu for breakfast?? Lots of great options on the regular menu but do be prepared for large portions. Their slogan is \"Good food. And plenty of it.\" Our boys somehow managed to tackle the whole plate, though.   Kids review: The chocolate waffle was yummy and really big. The bacon was salty and delicious. We liked everything.   Parents review: Amazing value and friendly service full of true southern hospitality. The prices for what you get are really reasonable. Most dishes come with a choice of hash browns, oatmeal or grits, as well as toast or biscuit. The omelette fillings were fresh, the poached eggs perfectly poached. There was a line-up out the door at 10am on a Sunday but we got in with a party of 8 in about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this place is great. The Tuesday special is a corned beef hash omelet and it's awesome. I love how it's not greasy like many places and it's full of flavor. Tons of locals here and friendly employees. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"See restaurants like this I have love hate for. They close at 3 pm. They have such a variety menu. The food was so good. And the quantities are enormous. Definatly a place we will return to with Family and Friends"}
{"text":"Very good!  We had a party of 6 for breakfast.  The service was FANTASTIC and the food was great!  Everyone was stuffed!  This was my first visit and I will definitely go back the next time I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Sort of a fan. Great Restaurant. Good Food. Bakery in house. Breakfast all day. All things that I love. However on 2 occasions I have asked the waitress to bring me a check after the food is delivered. Both of them waited an extra amount of time (one of them had to be asked a 2nd time). Call me goofy but this is a pet peeve of mine when dining at lunch by myself. I want to get in and get out. Please fix to make this the perfect breakfast lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Stacks is a great family restaurant. The facility is clean, and the staff is very friendly. The food was delicious. I had the Pecan Pancakes with an egg over easy. The pancakes were fluffy and the egg was cooked the way it should. My husband had the Shrimp and Grits, and was very happy with his choice. The price is great for the amount of food you get. The manager brought out a cake like desert(on the house) that was to die for. I'm putting Stacks on my go to places for breakfast...Keep up the good work Stacks!"}
{"text":"Great food. Big portions. Decent prices. Really busy, about a 20 minute wait. Coffee was really good. Waitress had an attitude though, bad service."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a busy Sunday so a wait was expected. We put our names on a list and waited patiently, the nice man that greeted us up front told us we were able to sit at the bar if we wanted to because there were two seats available. We sat there for about 15 minutes without being greeted or given a menu. A server randomly gave us some waters and said we'd be greeted soon. Another 5-10 minutes pass by and still no server... a server finally asks us if we're ready to order and we were let her know we still didn't have our menus. She gets us menus and returns to take our orders, the food came out quickly but we didn't have any silverware so we had to wait 5 more minutes for our server to come by and give us some.  My friend ordered the French toast and she said it tasted like some type of meat .. maybe because of where they cook it, I'm not sure. But I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and some hash browns. The bagel was great and fluffy I could tell it was fresh and the hash browns were good as well (huge portion for a great price). The service was terrible (from the server) but after getting our food we were out of there quickly and my bagel sort of made up for it. The cashier and the man that greeted us when we first walked in were very nice."}
