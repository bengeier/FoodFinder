{"text":"I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. we arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night. Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait.  We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us. Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks. 30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was \"didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?\" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they \"were just catching up\". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area. 5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it."}
{"text":"Great scenery. Solid food. Great energy! A must in the summer!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from this restaurant for the third time. It is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there. This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait).  About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us.  No one ever did so we left.   The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best."}
{"text":"This is my 9 year olds review.     Hamburgers are great and the cheese curds are awesome.   There is a Great Lake View"}
{"text":"We tried the fish fry a few weeks ago after hearing great reviews from friends. We weren't disappointed. Everything was wonderful. Tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite. The lobster bisque was cold ( Apparently, they forgot to turn the burner on and we were the first to mention it. We were there at 8:00pm.). The fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold. My husband asked why we didn't get any bread. He was told that they ran out. We found that interesting since people who were seated after we were had bread. Not sure we need to go back."}
{"text":"So I know Christy's is a Madison tradition with those lovely views of Lake Waubesa. But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza/sandwich menu."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood hangout with good food and great beer.  This is THE place to be on a summer night, and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter.  The place is loaded with character(s) and is a true Wisconsin tavern on the lake."}
{"text":"Great volleyball courts! The sand is soft but at night, some of the lights will shine right in your face and obstruct your view while you're playing.  There is a hose and area to rinse off afterwards, by the dock facing the beautiful, glistening Lake Waubesa.  A cherry bomb will run you $7 and a Vodka 7 will run you about $5 or so.  Be careful when you order the pizza, you start with either a 12\" ($8.99) or 16\" ($10.99) cheese and each topping is $1.50! My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100!  On Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it. Every time you were ready for more, just ask the nice bartender to give you more shells (corn hard shell or soft flour tortillas)."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with a view of Lake Waubesa. Beach volleyball, a place to dock your boat, and a tiki bar make it a hot spot in the summer, and the friendly staff, live music, impressive menu, beer selection and warm atmosphere make it great all year round.  A favorite of mine for more than 25 years."}
{"text":"This place has such potential but the service SUCKS! And I wrote that in capital letters on purpose. You literally have to stare a waitress down and even if you make eye contact you're lucky if they will stop at your table. Come on! We boat on the lake and wish there were better options than this. I guess it's Waypoint every time! As a side note: I'm writing this on a Sunday afternoon as I've been sitting at an outside table for over 15 minutes without one of the three servers currently working even acknowledging us! I really wanted the Shrimp Christy's. (Because it's fantastic!) Oh well. There probably won't be a next time either!"}
{"text":"Unless you're a local yokel McFarland douchebag, you won't get any measure of service here.  After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service.  Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland."}
{"text":"Decent but not great.  OK as far as bar food goes.  Very smokey."}
{"text":"Love going here during the summer.  Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching.  Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh.  Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, and views.  Great place to come by boat in the summer!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio last Sunday listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.  Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, but decided to finally write a review after last night. Each time we come here it's so much fun! Sometimes we come by boat, others by car. It's such a neat place for relaxing in the summer. The parmesan cod is my favorite dish, and my husband's deep fried cod was equally delicious. You really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had really high hopes for this place mostly because we noticed All You Can Eat Taco Bar on the website but apparently the websitr was not correct/up to date so we were left with other options. The waffle fries were delicious, wraps were average and a little pricey, and service was fair (even in the off season). Can definitely see the appeal during the summer but it won't be a place I seek for good eats and drink."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment, low key, full bar plus a tiki bar in the summer! Best nachos I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Overall just a chill, consistently great place that in the summer is the place to be if you like the sun lake and boating. Been looking for a place like this"}
{"text":"Drove out on the bikes on a gorgeous Sunday.   It wasn't overly crowded.  Overlooks the lake and many people dock their boats and enjoy the patio and food.   Lots of people taking food back out onto their boats.   Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat.  We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.    The menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the \"baskets\" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.   Overall, the food was good.   Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy.  The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return.  The place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!"}
{"text":"Menu is short. Excellent black bean veggie burger and seasoned waffle fries.  Old fashioneds are made from scratch/muddled.  I had excellent service while there--nice, competent bartender came outside to refill drinks several times.  It was a comfortable experience, relaxing outside watching the waves.  Veggie people beware taxidermied animals inside."}
{"text":"This place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere. Their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu, buy they don't seem to see this as a problem. I requested my favorite beer: \"Oh, we're out of that.\" Then, my second favorite: \"We're out of that too.\" As a vegetarian, I had to order a black bean burger, which was burned, as was the bun. I asked for a dark or spicy mustard. No, they just have the mainstream basics. Combine this with extremely mediocre service. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I was actually quite surprised at how good the fish fry was.  I had some great hashbrowns with it and my wife really enjoyed the salad that accompanied the meal.  If you're a craft beer lover like myself, you'll be disappointed in their beer selection, but Christy's is worth a visit solely for their fish fry."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews. We were made to feel very welcome as soon as we sat at the bar by Tim the bartender. He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location.   Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).  As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The cheese curds and fries are nice. Onion rings ok.  Wings my kids love but I think they are too smothered in sauce. Each time I've been here It was by boat so we've sat out side. I would have rated it a 3 or 4 except each and every table has an ash tray which is gross and they allow smoking in the entire area. My kids 6 and 11  were with us and one has asthma so we had to move to get out of the smoke. Very inconsiderate allowing smoking, only 3 out of maybe 40 people were smoking so maybe inconvenience 3 people and not everyone else. Going forward Ill probably just get takeout."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after hearing about it for literal years. The food was good bar food. The service was very friendly, but definitely on the slow side (it wasn't incredibly busy & there were plenty of staff members standing around). The location is fantastic, even if you don't have a boat. The biggest turnoff, and reason for only 3 stars, were the disgusting ashtrays at every table. I would 100% understand smoking at the outdoor bar, but it's simply gross & unnecessary at the dining tables."}
