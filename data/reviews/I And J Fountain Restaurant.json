{"text":"Came for dinner and so unbelievably DISAPPOINTED!! Ordered Salmon which was jerky not a filet. Management deemed it to be edible and did nothing to rectify the situation. Miserable experience and would never recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family was looking for someplace different to eat in the area. Figured we would swing by around 4:30 on Saturday. We entered and the place was completely empty except for one table. We were asked if we had a reservation. They said they are booked solid from 5:00 on. 

I guess it's a good problem to have when you turn away a family of 4 looking to try something new but we were stunned to find out they wouldn't serve us. Don't restaurants keep a few tables available for walk ins? 

That's okay. We went to Outback and spent about $100 and had a lovely meal. Too bad we couldn't give this place a food review. We like to support local businesses any time we can!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and I am pleased to say we will be back. Food is the best part and the live music is a plus. Would recommend to anyone who wants great food and music."}
{"text":"Live here for years. Always very good food.   Taste, excellent portions, and ambiance.  Caters to all but usually a more mature crowd.  Excellent service.  Never a complain.   Some dancing, some shows."}
{"text":"I really wish that I could say something nice about I@J. Sadly for me that is not the case. We came as a group of 8. (not that big, right) ?  There is one good thing that I can say. Our server arrived quickly, took our drink orders, came back and got our dinner orders.
The meals arrived in a timely manner. First came the loaded potato soup. It was ghastly. The waitress did replace it with a salad, which was Okay.
My husband and I ordered the \"famous\" prime rib. OMG! The meat indeed was cooked to order, but it reminded me of what I imagine the soles of my shoes would taste like.
Some members of our group got the all you could eat fried shrimp. They were waiting to get another serving of shrimp. The waitress had pulled a Houdini and was nowhere to be found. About 15 minutes she graced us with her presence, and the order for another portion was ordered. Uh- oh!  Wrong move. It took at least 30 minutes for their food to arrive. We snagged our server, and she said the kitchen was busy. It was difficult to phantom that because the restaurant was about 1/2 full as we had a 5:00 reservation.  The missing shrimp arrived. That meant that those of us who had ordered a not all you can eat, were forced to hang around an hour more necessary , (well we could of bugged out), but that would have come across as rude.
The one good thing that I can say is the band that played country western music. They were quite good. I even tipped them $5.00. The band got the patrons up dancing a line dance and more. I can not dance, but it was pleasurable watching other people enjoying their selves.    
Perhaps it is a sign of warning.......this establishment is indeed difficult to find. Take heed, and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food,  great prices, great decor, great owners and live music with nice dance floor.  We've had great times there over the years."}
{"text":"Just a fun evening of good country music, line dancing, food and friendly folks. Enjoyed the  Thursday Prime Rib special that was perfectly cooked and delicious. Polish pilsner beer brought back memories of my travels in Poland.    Can't wait to return - maybe a Monday night for the Polish food specials."}
{"text":"The Polish food was homey and good.  The service from Isabella was super.  The ambiance and singing and dancing on Karaoke night on Monday nights is so fun.  We are definitely coming back and letting folks know about this honest, authentic, unique place.  Even hidden where it is, we were able to find it along with several other folks and we were all having a blast. Thanks Isabella."}
{"text":"Love coming here Mondays and Tuesdays for karaoke. Their flat iron steak is great.  Place is clean and owners are friendly and take pride in their venue.  We will be coming back"}
