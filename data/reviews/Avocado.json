{"text":"The prices for the specials at avocado are great but service is sooo slow. This place was empty when I came in for some takeout.  I ordered 2 rolls and it took 15-20 minutes to make. It wasn't worth the wait either. The rolls were tiny and cut unevenly. At least the waiter was nice.  If you're a student, show your ID for 10% off :)"}
{"text":"Very good value.... staff is attentive. Chef/owner is a friendly guy.  We live in the bay/bloor area and we eat there quite a bit...   Sashimi plate is delicious and I love the signature roll. Can't remember the name but it is topped with salmon and Portobello mushroom. Yummy"}
{"text":"What a neat place, loved the menu and the ability to make the salad I wanted. Great place for the vegan conscious."}
{"text":"I hate giving poor reviews to places that honestly have great service and generally nice staff but the food here is just not good. There is so much filler- tempura flakes, too much use of mayo- it's worse than mediocre in my opinion.  And it's not even THAT cheap to justify the poor quality.   I feel bad giving a poor review, but if you don't mind less than mediocre sushi, at an average price, with nice service then go ahead."}
{"text":"I am addicted to Combo # 7  I just wanted to say- I am a big fan of sushi, and can eat it 247-365. Over the last few months I find myself eating at Avocado, but ordering the same thing (combo # 7). It consists of 6 piece California rolls, 6 piece spicy salmon and a spicy tuna hand roll. I have to admit I've never had anything else there, just cause I like this the best.   They don't have any tempura on the menu and the menu is a bit sparse, but not so bad for the price!"}
{"text":"I don't consume much sushi anymore - long story, food poisoning/allergy etc.  But when I did, I liked coming here because you can make your own rolls.  Sometimes, the outcome of this is bad.  Overall, I like it here and the guys who run it are super nice.  They're very friendly and they even asked why I wasn't stopping by anymore, remembering my past dedication."}
{"text":"Perfectly mediocre.  This is my go-to place for late night cheap eats in the area. It's good for what it is - late night cheap eats. It's not the prettiest place, and the fish isn't the freshest, but it's decent and good price for value. The udon was better than I expected and all the food portions are big.  Their miso soup tasted like it has half the miso paste it should and twice the salt. The \"tea\" tasted like the hot water used to wash the cup that had a sip of tea left in it.  My advice is just don't drink anything made there."}
{"text":"Pretty decent cheap n' cheerful teriyaki/bento place. Avocado saved my ass on more than one occasion recently, as I'd been in the process of moving back to the States and had packed up all my cooking and eating utensils and thus had been eating out every meal. I'd been getting tired of sandwiches and was looking forward to a simple, healthy meal. The $8 teriyaki bento, which included chicken teriyaki, several slices of tofu, brown rice, and salad was great. The chicken teriyaki consisted of white meat and wasn't over-sauced and cooked well. The option of having brown rice was definitely a plus. OTOH, my husband ordered the combination sushi, teriyaki, and gyoza bento which wasn't as good. I suppose it was good as could be expected for discount sushi, but... yeah. I'd say avoid the sushi and stick to the teriyaki.   The guys that work there are pretty nice. The place isn't the cleanest, but it's tidy enough and for the price you can't do much better."}
{"text":"small kind of dirty spoon lunch place, very casual.  good food, I got the spicy salmon roll combo. and some sake  not much to say other than it was great sushi. Most of the places I have been are very unimpressive and generic, this one had good service and the food tasted like it was actually made with some care.  normally I find sushi very boring and bland but this place actually had some.. spunk? to it."}
{"text":"I write this as my oven is heating up for my frozen pizza. Just got back from picking up my take out from Avocado. 5 mins later, that shit went down the garbage chute (hence the frozen pizza).   This place sucks. My roommate and I both didn't get what we ordered, at all. And what we got was disgusting.   We ended up with chicken in the gyoza's (asked for veggie) and my roommate only got one - menu says 2, SOGGY avocado rolls (asked for california rolls), slimy tofu, hard rice, salad was not worth eating. They even fucked up the miso soup.   Wondering how this place is still in business. I have never experienced something so bad."}
{"text":"Avocado is one of those unassuming little eateries that you can just pop in for a quick and casual meal at. On the warm afternoon when I stopped in to grab a bite, the colourful photos of the menu really helped work up my appetite.   The hwe dup bap which I took a while to decide upon arrived in a large traditional (Korean) metal bowl and was delicious and humongous. I loved the addition of avocado to the sashimi, iceberg, seasoned rice, and spicy sauce combination. It was also nice to have the option to substitute for brown rice.  Sitting outside to enjoy the weather on a warm day can be nice, but with the heavy traffic and tall surrounding buildings, Bay really isn't the best for people watching."}
{"text":"I went here once and I don't think I would return. It was OK, but Sushi Club is just around the corner, which I much prefer.  Avocado is tiny inside with about 5-6 tables in total. They also have a small patio with another few tables.  I didn't find the lunch specials especially cheap. For lunch - I want a bargain. Most of the lunch combos are between $8-$12 and portions weren't big.  I found the menu to be a bit overcomplicated. I had a heck of a time figuring out what to order.  There was only one waitress, she was very friendly but things were taking quite awhile to arrive as the place was full. I want lunch served quickly so I can get back to the office within the hour. This place was pushing it, the food took a bit of time, but nothing too ridiculous.  I tried the bento box #1 with chicken. It came with a few more items than a regular bento (a tofu dish plus some gyozas along with the usual teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, and miso). It was decent.  It is pretty cool that you can make your own maki though...if I ever go back I will try that. Might be better as a take out joint, because the interior is pretty basic."}
{"text":"I came here after a hard night of training and was ravenously hungry.  There isn't a lot of seating in there but thankfully it wasn't very busy.  I was impressed with the prices and ordered the chirasi.  Being as hungry as I was I was ready to destroy the raw fish and rice goodness that lay before me.  It didn't disappoint and tasted good.  Mind you, anything would have tasted good to me at that point in time including moldy beef jerky.  However, I probably could have ate another four bowls and thought about hopping the counter and stuffing my face with whatever I could get my grubby hands on.  Thankfully, my rational self kicked in and I did not."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Bay St. I actually dislike going to the Bay and Bloor corridor because everything looks kind of rundown officey but after catching a TIFF film at the Varsity, I had to get something to eat and couldn't bare to walk across Queen's Park on an empty stomach.  Avocado gets five stars because they have a make-your-own-maki-roll deal for EIGHT DOLLARS. Yes, you heard me, you get TEN PIECES of PERSONALLY DESIGNED maki for $8.  You get a choice of up to seven ingredients (I decided to rip off my favourite roll at New Gen and opted for cucumber, green onion, tempura bits, spicy mayo, and a double portion of avocado) and to make this even better (yes, it gets better!), I got a TIFF ticket discount but they also offer a student discount.  To sum this up: for $8, you get ten pieces of sushi-as-you-like-it and if you are a student, you can get it for even less.  They only do delivery if you order between 3 and 10 and the total is over $25. Take out is always an option, though.  This is a dream come true."}
