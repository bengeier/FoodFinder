{"text":"Excellent Italian food and most of all a wonderful cultural experience.  The portions are HUGE, prices are low, and you can BYOB without worrying about a high uncorking charge - they don't have one!  Sadly, Ida is no longer serving breakfast (She isn't a kid anymore) but for lunch and dinner it's hard to beat.  They mostly serve very traditional dishes but do so very well.  Their specials are always excellent.  It's fairly informal (It is Arnold after all) but it's worth making the trip.  

Now for the cultural experience.  Ida is a delight.  She's very warm, kind and friendly, but with more sass than just about anyone I know.  She is NOT PC.  If it's getting toward the end of the night, she will often pull up a chair and join in the conversation.  The whole place can be a bit like eating in someone's dining room.  Everyone joins in the conversation and it makes for a friendly, enjoyable evening.  One night I was there, another couple brought homemade biscotti to share with the entire restaurant.  What a treat!  Most of the servers are older ladies as well and very relaxed and friendly.  Everyone seems to enjoy themselves!

One final thought - bring CASH.  She doesn't take cards.  The billing protocol is to go to the counter when you're done and tell her what you had to eat and she'll ring it in."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an Italian woman to treat you like an Italian grandmother this is the place to go!  Ida is the sweetest thing.  (And hilarious) she makes all the food right there for you to see.  Her meat sauce is the best I've ever had in my life! The portions are huge for what you pay. If you can finish a whole meal in one sitting,  hats off to you! This place is so small and right in downtown New Kensington you would never expect it to be one of the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Tried Ida's Place this past weekend when we were in town visiting family.  It's a very small, casual restaurant with simple decor.  The owner, Ida, is the cook and has a reputation for being a pistol...she apparently is known for being short tempered and loud.  There was an article written about her in the Pittsburgh paper some months ago and in it, she admits to swearing within earshot of patrons.

However, while we were there, Ida was quiet so I can't report on anything unusual happening.  The menu was very simple and limited but certainly adequate for anyone wanting basic, good, old-fashioned Italian food and a lot of it.  There were a couple of chicken specials written on a blackboard for the day and the menu itself included rigatoni, lasagna, ravioli, spaghetti.  I had the lasagna and a meatball and both were very good.  The portions are HUGE.  The \"small\" lasagna I got was bigger than any full sized portion I've ever gotten anywhere and it was swimming in sauce.   Very nice.  

We all took home leftovers for lunch the next day.  Had a piece of cheesecake that was homemade, but I'm sorry to say we didn't care for it."}
{"text":"As good as Italian food gets. Ida's sauce is the best ever, and I grew up in an Italian house with many Italian aunts and married an Italian, so I know my sauce. Ida's is perfect, every time. I don't know how she does it! It's like magic and I could honestly just eat it with a spoon, it's THAT GOOD. inexpensive, huge portions. Pasta can be a little more than al dente, but that's ok. Meatballs are fabulous, and so is the eggplant parm. Salad is just a plain salad, and the chicken soup is truly from scratch in that sometimes it's better than others (just like real homemade soup)! Ida is a trip and swears like a drunken sailor, so be mindful whom you bring with you for this delicious meal! If you bring kids, she won't drop the F-bomb, but she still swears :)"}
{"text":"The best red sauce ever!

If you're looking for a cozy little place where you can enjoy some of the most delicious home made Italian dishes anywhere around, look no further than Ida's Place. Just across the New Kensington Bridge lies this hidden gem. Ida Peluso is like that sweet little Italian neighbor that always bring you over leftover food from Sunday dinner just to make sure you have something to eat.

The interior of the restaurant is just like your grandma's house, antique furniture everywhere. The walls are lined with lots of old framed photos. The place only has about ten or so tables inside and two outside.

Ida's offers breakfast, lunch and dinner and has all of the staples, Spaghetti, Rigatoni, Ravioli, Gnocchi, Lasagna and much more. Most of the entrees cost less than $10.00. The portions are HUGE and more than enough to share between two to three average sized eaters. You can't possibly eat it all! The daily specials handwritten on a white erase board. 

We started off with a salad which consisted of lettuce, pears, pecans, dried cherries and a cherry vinaigrette dressing. Next we were offered fresh rolls and butter. My wife and I both had the Pasta Bolognese which was one of today's specials. It was outstanding! Our daughter had the Meatloaf which came with a side of Spaghetti. Ida then brought us a bowl of huge meatballs to try and some spicy Gnocchi to try since we had never had it before. Ida and our daughter had a good time as Ida teased her that if she didn't finish her plate she would have to go in the kitchen and help her wash dishes. The service was perfect.

Call to see what the daily specials are. You can get all of her delicious food to go also.
FYI: She closed Mondays and Sundays and closes around 8pm so go early. It's BYOB (wine only) and she does NOT charge you to open the bottle.

If you love Italian food, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Best sauce by far ! The meals are amazing and good sized. Ida is a very good cook and has a charming personality. She has no problems expressing herself ! While I was there she was trying to check give someone directions over the phone, apparently the person was talking over her so she told them to shutup and listen. They arrived 10 minutes later ! She'll do custom menus for parties, they call it family style !"}
{"text":"Checked in again. Even better! Ida fed us family style. Food, great; fellowship, great; entertainment (courtesy of Ida's sharp tongue), great. Pretty soon, the wine started flowing and then more friends came. Friends who were already in the restaurant came and joined us at our table. Before we knew it, it was a raucous party (within reason since we asked the people around us if we were making too much noise. Maybe they were just being nice, but everyone said no! ) and we closed down the place."}
{"text":"So yummy!  The meatballs are the best!  We stopped in for lunch, there was no wait and the service was perfect!  Ida was friendly and funny.  The neighborhood is pretty sketchy but this place was totally worth going!   Huge portions and totally affordable.  Bring cash with you though because they only take cash."}
{"text":"With absurdly large portions and a staff that treats you like one of the family, Ida's is one of the great old school Italian joints. I stopped by for takeout just as they were closing up and ordered a lasagna dinner - they sent me home with enough food for three meals. The sauce is incredible, all fresh tomatoes and herbs. A green salad with tomatoes and homemade dressing and fresh crusty bread rounded out the huge portion of lasagna. It would be impossible to leave hungry. Mangia!"}
{"text":"\"I recently visited this restaurant, the owner was rude and service was terrible, over priced for the crapy food and lack of authentic Italian, American food, everything is pre made and heated on microwave!!!!!.. I couldnt believe the salad I got and to top it off the advertise grilled chicken dish was a dry piece of chicken over old saggy lettuces that got me sick!!!! Stay away from this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ida will soon be opening a new restaurant!  Ida's Home Place will be opening at 2803 Leechburg Road in Lower Burrell, PA.  Excited!"}
{"text":"Place caught fire on on 9/14/16. Appears to be closed for the foreseeable future. I would be shocked if it ever opens again."}
{"text":"You walk into this cozy, spotless restaurant with an open kitchen and you feel like you were transported to a bistro on a street in Italy or someone invited you to a large family home cooked dinner at their house. Go here if you want a real Italian experience and have a craving for good pasta with lots of homemade sauce. Bring your Italian wines, BYOB and cash, no credit cards and sit back and enjoy the food and atmosphere. I ordered the larger size of Lasagne because I thought for about $13, which include a salad with homemade dressing and Italian bread that it couldn't be that large. When I was served it looked like it was a dish for all 4 of us. Very good with lots of bread to scoop up the sauce. Ida pretty much does it all except for some help serving tables and she comes out to check on her \"family\" during dinner. Don't wait for a check, go to the counter when ready to leave and tell Ida what you had and she rings you up. She has specials on certain days and some special at other times like a stuffed chicken or pork, chicken parm, bolognese etc ,you come here for pasta! Not in the nicest area but this isn't just a local restaurant but a destination. Come here when you want pasta and want to feel like you went to Italy or to a private home cooked meal. If you do not live close make the drive and have a great experience. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ida makes the absolute best comfort Italian food I have ever had!  The portions are huge! Take a cooler bag with you to lug it all home with you!  I love the bolognese sauce, chicken parm, and just her plain spaghetti!  You can`t go wrong here. Cash only and BYOB.  Ida cooks everything is it is great when she makes an appearance at your table!  She is a trip!!  We love going there though!"}
{"text":"This place looks like someone's living room, dinner room & kitchen... Had about 15 table set-up & one waitress taking orders, serving and cleaning up, plus Ida (owner) in the kitchen cooking.

I got the day's special, Peppers & Olives on spagetti w/dinner salad. The portion was way too big and too salty. All their pasta dishes were in red sause and didn't seem homemade. Dinner salad had a bunch of lettuce, ONE wedge of tomato, and ONE slice of cucumber... Dinner rolls were cold and some seems still frozen. At the end of the meal, we had to walk up to the register/kitchen area and TELL them what we ordered... cash only too.

Ida was nice and friendly, and went around to each table to chat with the customers. My bf's grandpa is a patron of the restaurant, so she stood around and chit chat with him and gave us free biscotis. :)

Overall the experience was ok... I would recommend they expand their menu, restaurant space and technology to upgrade the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ida makes you feel like family!  Her portions are HUGE for the price.  I am very picky with Italian.  I love her sauce and meatballs.  My fav are her spicy meatballs when she has them on special.  Come hungry or you will have leftovers for the next day!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ida's a few times, so I knew when we were going to have a family dinner it was the place to go. I called a few days ahead to make sure she could seat 12 of its, and Ida was more then accommodating. We brought a cake to celebrate a birthday. Service was amazing, and,as always the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places we've ever stumbled upon.  All fresh in an open kitchen.  Delish!"}
{"text":"This is an experience like no other. Being out of towners in the 'Burgh for the US Open, we were quickly recognized by the proprietress as we entered this small, classic old time Italian eatery far off the beaten path for usual travelers (thank you, Yelp!!!). As we entered and stood awkwardly just inside the doorway, with the other diners looking on in curiosity, she muttered \"What the hell is this?\" as she eyed up our foursome of hungry golf attired middle aged strangers. But wow, what charm and what great food. The menu is very limited (a small number of pastas, with or without meatballs, ravioli, gnocchi and lasagna, all served a ala carte or meal style with salad, along with a number of daily specials), it's BYOB and cash only, but despite all of this, we will be heading back whenever we're in shouting distance, as the foul-mouthed, over the top Italian grandmother of an owner was not only entertaining, but a truly genuine, generous host serving delicious homemade Italian food."}
{"text":"OMG! Ida's is the most fabulous! The Bolognese was amazing. Ida herself does all the cooking in an open kitchen. Forget Lidia's and get your ass up to Ida's! Bring a bottle of red and kick back for the best experience you've had in years,"}
{"text":"Great meal. Wife had lasagna and I had Bolognese. 
Great . Friendly Service . Location is a bit challenging but well worth the effort.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tucked away on a main street in Arnold, PA is Ida's Place.  Decor is thrifty chic with its red and white checkered table cloths.  Ida is one straight up lady.  She treats you like you're one of the family--quick witted, tells it like it is.  
Large portions come with your order from the chalk board menu of the day.  This place gets crowded at lunch time."}
{"text":"saying that this place has the best Italian food in the NK/Arnold/LB area would be a rude understatement......Ida's might have some of the best dinners in the Pittsburgh area for the price and quality of the dish 

ive been here a handful of times and I am always pleased with the service and the exceelent home cooked food 


if you haven't been there and you live in the area....it is a must"}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the best Italian food experience I've ever had.  I had pasta with meatsauce, and it was fantastic.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.   Service was exceptional.  I live in Pittsburgh, but I'll certainly drive the 45 minutes to Arnold to go again.  It was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Ida is a bitch (but I love her) - but her food has heart, love and bitching in it - she will rip you a new one but give you a great meal.  Only knock is parking, bad location and her sauce is good (but I like sweeter, not herb-ee)- never a bad meal"}
