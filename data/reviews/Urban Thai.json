{"text":"Surprisingly pretty solid, I'd give Urban Thai a 3.5 if I could but I'm not yet ready to assign four stars.  We ordered take-out, specifically the veggie dinner for two which comes with: tofu pad thai; basil tofu with rice; and two spring rolls.  I also added a lemongrass mushroom soup to the order because, well, who wouldn't?    The only thing better than not having to go outside (or cook) to obtain a steaming, delicious dinner is when it comes in half the expected time.  I've grown accustomed to waiting over an hour for delivery so my grumbling stomach was easy to quell when the food came in about 35 minutes.     The food itself was good, not 'this is amazing' kind of good, but good enough to reorder when feeling lazy and hungry.  The spring rolls were probably the best part, sweetly spicy, great texture and a nice crisp wrapping.  The pad thai? Pretty much the standard tasty somewhat ketchup-y fried noodles that you'll find all over the city.  The soup was a bit scant and both it and the basil tofu were super, super greasy -you know when your hands and face feel slippery for hours even after washing and wringing your serviette? Despite that, everything still tasted delicious and portions were large enough to have a mini lunch serving for one the next day.  I think I'll try them again to see if they can prove worthy of another star."}
{"text":"They are under new management now, so my old \"go to \" deal doesn't exist anymore, but the food is still a really good standard Thai restaurant in the hood. I ordered it again this past weekend in the quality is still excellent."}
{"text":"Won't order from them again - food was late, cold order incomplete - called the restaurant who said they can't do anything because they are busy - so decided to post this review to assist with the busy issue"}
{"text":"Cute spot ever too busy! Delicious!!!! Finished off with a scoop of ice cream!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst \"thai\" food I've ever had.  Ordered the spicy beef salad, which is described like a laab/larb style salad - one or my favorite Thai dishes. When it came it was a bed of iceberg lettuce (huh??) and some tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers that were not fresh at all. They were almost see through they were so stale. A few pieces or beef thrown in there and a horrible taste. It wasn't even edible. I had to throw it out after spitting out my first bites.   Also ordered the Malay curry chicken which came in a thin watery flavourless sauce and didn't taste like any Malay curry I've ever had. I usually don't eat rice with curry chicken but not even an entire order or rice could thicken it up enough. It was more like a soup.   Kicking myself for trying a new spot and not sticking to my usual favorites. I only took a few Thai cooking classes and find it baffling that the chef(s) could get these dishes so wrong. On top of it all, it was very expensive. Never again :("}
{"text":"Review of an order placed through just-eat.ca:  I normally don't review restaurants, but this one was so bad I stopped eating mid-dinner and logged on here just so I could post this. So many things wrong with the food. Everything is just so unbelievably bland. If I didn't know better I'd think Thai people don't have any salt!  Chicken wings - cold, dry, tasteless. Thai Spring Rolls - the boxed ones from the grocery store are probably better. Beef samosa - tasteless. Where's the goddamn seasoning? Chicken Fresh Salad Rolls - Very large in diameter so impossible to eat in one go, obviously dismantling once bitten into. Also, extremely bland. Aromatic Seafood Combination - bland. Calamari - Passable at best. If I wanted average calamari I could've got an order from the run-of-the-mill pub downstairs for the same price.  As if all of the above wasn't enough, the driver was 45 minutes late. Never again."}
{"text":"Delivery was 1.5hrs late. When I called to double check they were not apologetic what so ever.  Finally food came and it's COLD. Sure I can reheat it, but the quality of the food was absolutely horrid.   Haphazardly put together food, and the most WATERY green curry ever.   Not to mention it's all spilled cuz they didn't package it properly.  ZERO stars if I could. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Items: Pad Thai (Chicken), and Golden Curry.  Less than stellar for both. Pad Thai was dry, and the taste was bland, save the lime I squeezed over it. The curry had a great initial impression, but a tad overwhelming after a few more tastes."}
{"text":"Our waiter Sabir must hav ESP, he was attentiv2 my every thot! Made sur my fuud was sans sugar as I find most Thai fuud outside of Thailand tends 2b 2sweet & 'm diabetic. Service was prompt, curteous  & portions were mor den we can finish with enuf take hom for 2moro's lunch. My editor had Beef curry wich he inhaled lol, I had Fish Devil & our 2gurls had vegee green curry & pad thai. We ordered apps wich came w Chiken but Sabir waived charges. All came2 amazin 65$ w pitcher of beer. Sabir even adviced us not 2hav sep bills 2get 15% discount wich meant we saved on Sophie Trudeau's nanny fund lol. I never pay attention 2uther peepo's reviews, so nuthng on here matter."}
{"text":"Bought this off of a Just Eat discount. Had the Pad thai and green curry. Pad thai tasted too kechupy, and Green curry too sweet. Would recommend to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"BEWARE of Urban Thai! or at least of getting food delivered from them. Last evening  we ordered three dishes - Green Mango Salad, Curry Pad Thai with shrimp, and Mango Chicken - and were very disappointed, to say the least. The first was bland and tasteless, the second was congealed mush with a few shrimp, and the third consisted of horribly overcooked chicken with a few vegetables. The sodium count of everything was through the roof. According to their glossy take-out menu, the chicken was supposed to come with jasmine rice, but didn't. The price tag for all this mediocrity was $65! The service was indifferent at best. An hour after I made the online order, I received a phone call from Urban Thai saying that they had just received the order and it would be another 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I phoned and a grumpy man told me that I should have called the restaurant instead of ordering online. But the take-out menu which came to my door says in block letters: ORDER ONLINE! All in all: a dreadful experience."}
{"text":"Ordered on UberEATS, came in a foodora bag, weird but ok. RED curry, colourless and tasteless. spring rolls, bland and the sauce.. just sugary water."}
{"text":"Since moving to residence, I have been craving a some flavour in my life. That and a need to stop wearing yoga pants.   With six friends in tow we trekked downtown for thai food, lured here by their Sapporo promo.   Here is the low down: yummy pad thai! While I opted for the semi-safe curried pad thai, everything on our table looked delicious and free. Portions were amazing, and we had more than enough to bring home for leftovers. But cmon, who wants to be rolling up to the bar with doggie bags?  Excellent food, good prices, nice atmosphere. Service was so-so, but that isn't stopping me from drool-worthy dreams of pad thai."}
{"text":"C'est pas le meilleur restaurant Thai de Toronto, loin de là. Mais c'est constant et ça tient la route. Pour y être passé plusieurs fois, j'y ai trouvé un bon plat : un 'stir-fry' à l'avocat et aux arachides mais curieusement ce n'est pas un restaurant que je souhaite fréquenter par envie : c'est plutôt un lieu pratique pour rencontrer clients et fournisseurs."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday evening for dinner with a friend before a show at the mod club, and immediately you are drawn to the ascetics of the place. Really modern, very clean, and really nicely designed.   The service was a little rough, because our waitress didn't really speak English or French. She was confused by most of our questions so we had to wing it and hope for the best.   The food was great. We both got Tom kha, and it had just the right amount of coconut. We followed up with a chicken and avocado and red curry beef. Both were great and we had more that enough to bring home."}
{"text":"I just spent $18 (!!!) on take-out curry pad thai with shrimp. Although I should have just left when I saw the price, I was hungry and went through with my order.  I currently have it in front of me and I can't finish it because it's so incredibly dry. I taste no curry and there hardly seems to be sauce on it at all!   If I'm going to pay that much for some curry pad thai, I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered again, only the pineapple rice. It was terrible. Bland terribly overcooked there was essentially 4 pieces of chicken which were tough and dry. The order was 30 minutes late, and the driver made me go out to the car to get it. Terrible service, rude driver, unbelievably late, especially given that we'd already waited an hour for the order. Absolutely will not order here again and strongly suggest avoiding this place. Really just disappointing on all counts."}
{"text":"Nice, modern, glassy venue with a somewhat tropical feel too. Wish I wasn't seated so close to the door but it's ok.   Yummy food! Vegetable green curry with a perfect little portion of rice on the side. Water with a lemon wedge, always a nice touch. I love a little bit of lemon.   Meh service. The food came fast. Noted: the waitress seemed to be working every other table with her charm, except for mine. I know you can probably tell that I'm a student, but come on!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great services. I would recommend this establishment. *P.S. buy the chicken and shrimp Pad chu."}
{"text":"Ordered online through Just Eat. Delivery was predicted at 55 minutes but took 90 minutes. I had to go out on my front lawn to find the delivery man, who had went next door. Food is pretty good and portions always leave enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"Went in because I saw a deal on Feedback App (which I got intro'd to at a Yelp Elite Event) for some Pad Thai & was super hungry. Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed by what I got from this place both in terms of service and in terms of food.  I ordered and it said you could pick up the food any time between given hours so I went in to pick up my food. The place was empty when I walked in...to the point that I had to wait a few seconds before a staff member came out from the back room. Because of this, I asked if I could sit down and just eat my food there. They said no issues, I could sit wherever I wanted. I sat down at the long table to wait the (expected) 20 minutes it would take them to make the pad thai.  Finally, the pad thai came out all wrapped to go (even though they knew I intended to eat there). I excitedly unpacked it. I read other people's reviews of this place's pad thai on Yelp and they said it had a strong ketchup taste, I could not agree more. To be honest, the pad thai there is terrible. I should have listened to the other Yelpers, and you should too.  When I realized just how bad this pad thai was, I looked around for something to try to help the flavor. I was hoping for some Sriracha or similar but couldn't find anything in the dining area and the staff member had disappeared into the back room again, much to the chagrin of the delivery app person who was there waiting to make a pickup. Finally, the staff member appeared again. I could tell that any request for seasoning without some \"greasing of the palms\" would be met with anything but enthusiasm so I first asked if I could buy a soda. After buying the soda, I suddenly \"remembered\" I wanted some seasonings. First, the employee tried handing me a bottle of Sriracha which had clearly seen better days and had a meager amount of sauce left in its bottom which had changed color in the time it had been sitting there unused and crusted over. I asked for a fresh bottle and they went to get one without too much grumbling. I doused the pad thai in sriracha and with its magical powers it was able to make the food mostly edible and I finished it because I was so hungry to begin with.  Never going back in here again unless they make some SERIOUS changes. If I were you, I would find my pad thai elsewhere."}
{"text":"I only ordered take out from Urban Thai.  Took over an hour for food to arrive.  Pad thai was bland and wasn't good.  Orange chicken was pretty good as well as the mango chicken.  The golden curry chicken was alright and portion was on the small side."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a poor rating! I only got it as takeout delivered so I can't fully weigh in but I really enjoyed the food from here! I got the hot and sour soup, which was chock full of good stuff and perfectly spicy, then the spring rolls and veggie samosas, which were both crispy, deliciously filled, and perfectly paired with an interesting honey/oil sauce, and finally the chicken devil with rice and chicken pad thai as my mains, both of which were aromatic, flavourful and packed with tender chicken and crisp vegetables. I would eat here again 100%!"}
{"text":"Food delivery arrived an hour and a half late (over 2 hours after I ordered) and the guy still waited for a tip. The services industry is a complete mess in this city. Tips should not be expected. They have to be earned. The food arrived cold and my guests were already on the way out so I had it reheated the next day for lunch. Was fine but I'm too soured on the service to give an unbiased review of the food."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp pad Thai and the famous avocado chicken with peanut sauce and a Thai ice thai.   The pad Thai was really salty but decent and I was expecting more from the famous avocado peanut chicken. Overall the food was good but nothing to write home about. More authentic thai food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I guess some folks have had bad experiences with the dine-in service. I only get take-out, so I don't have any comments on that. The take-out is always ready when they say it will be, and there are various discounts and offers, depending on the order size.  My standard order from Urban Thai is red curry beef with a side of sticky rice and the seasonal vegetables. 'Seasonal vegetables' sounds like the dullest dish ever, but they put a really delicious sweet and spicy sauce on those crisp veggies and they become very interesting indeed. The red curry is rich and creamy and the slices of beef are tender. I don't bother with the appetizer items because they're nothing special. I do love the free warm shrimp crackers with take-out, though.   My favourite part of picking up a fresh order from Urban Thai is when I get to enjoy two or three lunches of leftovers afterwards."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Thai experience I've ever had at a Thai restaurant. Service was poor, with incredibly long wait times for a completely empty restaurant other than my friend and I. I tried the chicken avocado stir-fry it was definitely unique but not to my liking and way to heavy on the peanut flavour, while my friends enjoyed the red curry which was subpar at best lacking much flavour. The restaurant itself had a cool modern aesthetic but it felt sort of out of place for a Thai restaurant. Anyways long story short, poor service, subpar food and long wait times. Now I understand why it was empty the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Stuck at home with a sick baby, who wants me to hold him all the time - so really hard to cook anything lol!   I ordered from Just eat. Then decided to read some reviews on here, just to see what I was getting myself in to.  Man, I don't understand why this place gets such bad reviews! I ordered the dinner for 2. #171 on the menu. But I substituted green curry chicken for the Pad Thai. The food came in about 40 mins. It was hot. It smelled amazing! The soup was good, but could have been a bit spicier. The green curry and mango salad were amazing! Came with steamed rice, cooked perfectly.   The spring rolls are the only reason I gave it a 4 star review instead of 5. Pale in colour, not so crispy, which I think is to be expected since its delivery and has to sit in a box until its gets here. But the taste was meh. I would not order them again.   I will most definitely order food from urban Thai again"}
{"text":"Expensive. Bland. Boring. Bad service. Long wait. Edible.  There is too much good food in this city to waste your money on mediocre Sri Lankan Thai."}
{"text":"AVOID ORDERING! I placed my order at half past 11, to arrive at 12:30. by 1am I call and they said '5 min'. At 1:35 i kept calling with no answer. Called Just-eats at 1:45 to cancel, they said ' company said 5 min' and i said i've already heard that just cancel it. Went to bed at 2, and my neighbour was woken from them delivering at 2:35- 45 min after I cancelled and almost 3 hours after the order  was placed! I never woke up, so didn't get the food in the end.  If its going to be late thats one thing, but stop lying!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food an hour and a half ago  and I'm still waiting.  It's going to have to be the best Thai food I've ever had  to bump up the rating.   Food took over 2 hours to arrive. The Santa clause parade was going on, but I still could have walked to the restaurant and back in that time.  The delivery guy was nice enough to give us the food free of charge in exchange for a tip. It is pretty good; with the outcome being nearly free food, I guess I am satisfied."}
{"text":"They've got the best pa thai I've ever had. Its not the immitation stuff either. They make it just the way I like it and they cater to their regular customers needs (which is a major plus now eh?)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here because it has an almost 5 star rating on Just Eat and over 900 reviews. If only i'd checked Yelp first... URGH. The spring rolls are basically raw. The pastry on them is white and they are starting to uncurl. Inedible. The chicken pad thai has a weird tangy/tomatoey taste to it - very synthetic and not like pad thai at all. The three or four slivers of chicken are as tough as boots. They get two stars because thenpad thai is edible... Just not very nice. What is it with Just Eat and their reviews? They are almost always so wrong. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Friday night.. preordered... 30 minutes late.  Samosa sends like it's made of play doh. Spring rolls stone cold.  Pad Thai tastes like ketchup."}
{"text":"Let's start with what's good about this place, because it will be very short : the golden curry.  Now, let's jump to what's wrong. This place used to be my go to place on lazy Sunday nights. I used to order takeout over the phone and it would be ready in about 15 minutes (I live 5 minutes away).   Then, they changed management and everything went awry. I called to order, they told me to come 20 minutes later, I came and my food wasn't ready. I waited another 30 minutes to get my food. Another time, another order, I showed up later than what they said and still waited 45 minutes for my food. The best part is they didn't offer any form of compensation, a free appetizer, a discount, ANYTHING. Customer service : 0.  I was going to stop going to this place but unfortunately, I had bought a bunch of Wagjag coupons back when the place was still running properly so I had to use them. I went in one day and tried to use the value I paid on an expired Wagjag coupon (which you can do) and they refused to honour it. The waitress went to check with her manager who was sitting right there and didn't even make the effort of coming to talk to me and try to find a compromise. When I told them I'd never come back, she said just: \"Sure!\"   Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered online and waited 90 minutes before calling the restaurant. I was told my food was late because the driver got a flat tire. First off, I'm not buying it and second, if that were actually the case I would have appreciated a phone call letting me know about the delay."}
{"text":"Food wise - It was ok.  The spring rolls were ok. Very plain. Not much flavour in the filling, but it wasn't as crunchy as I would think in stores as it sat in the box for a bit before it got to us. The soup's (hot and sour as well as the chicken coconut soup) we've had better else where.  The Urban Legend Shrimp Curry Pad Thai was good. It was not dried out and the noodles were done well.  Not soggy, but not underdone. The downfall about this dish -it only had 3 shrimps in it and there was also chicken which wasn't listed when we ordered.  Not sure if that was done by mistake.  We ordered this online on tasteaway.com It was ordered yesterday at 6:34pm and was delivered at 8:21pm.  Almost 2 hours.  And like Aaron D. we also did the tip before hand and wished we hadn't.  Moving forward, i won't be using the tip feature of the site and will wait for the driver to arrive.  That was disappointing.  Otherwise, the packaging of the meal was fine. They provided a few cheap napkins, chopsticks and spoons. Everything was clean and nothing leaked out."}
{"text":"Not sure why you would choose to open a Thai restaurant and serve Pad Thai made of ketchup."}
{"text":"I heard that the pad thai is a safe option. The red curry beef with mango was not, from my experience.  Wouldn't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Meh. Some of the sauces were thick like snot. In a bad way."}
{"text":"Got take out and freshrolls were sloppy and just tossed into container with no dipping sauce. Spring rolls were just oil filled tubes and again no dipping sauce. When I phone back, the woman said she was too busy and hung up on me. Never eating or ordering again. Worst service in a long time"}
{"text":"Same as every other Thai delivery. Nothing special. Even menus are the same. Errors also the same."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I chose to eat here when we were in the area this week.  She ordered the chicken pad thai, and I had the chicken Urban Thai spicy noodles.    I'm glad to be able to say that the food was excellent, the portion size was great, prices were reasonable, the interior was cozy and our server was very polite and helpful.  I would say the biggest downfall of Urban Thai is that their washroom facilities aren't accessible, which is so important in this day and age.  The stairwell going down to the washrooms is quite steep and narrow - wouldn't be easy with any mobility device."}
{"text":"Wow! That was alll bad.. I'd been craving Thai for a few days so I weathered the storm to find Thai. Came across this place and was soo happy. Scrammed home and much to my disappointment, this food was yuck!  The salad rolls are ridiculous.. Sooo huge you can't even eat AND they have NO flavor.. The Pad Thai, WTF - smothered in sauce..    Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Terrible on every conceivable level. Just so terrible I am not even sure where to begin.  Well, I guess I do know where to begin;  Logically; let's start with the appetizers- veggie spring-roles.   These things were so sweet that after eating one of them, I was pretty much off the rest of my meal.    I don't know about you but I certainly do not want spingrolls to taste sweet.  On top of that, I don't want them to taste like fake America syrup.  Terrible, terrible, terrible    Such a colossal waste of time and money.   Also, UberEats, stop delivering such shit"}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but every time i've ordered takeout here it's been a mess. They've claimed my order is picked up on Foodora and other apps before i even stepped foot in the restaurant. When I finally do show up, I still have to wait for my order. One time they even told a Foodora customer support rep that my food was ready, and when I arrived 5 min later, it was still cooking! I spent the wait time writing this review. Stop lying   Beware, they operate on the apps under different names - I think \"Thai Boys\" is them too."}
{"text":"We ordered via their web site this evening, 5th January 2018.  ETA showed 45 minutes - food arrived after 90 minutes  The Hot & Sour Soup was sooo spicy it was inedible, and cold  The Cold Salad Rolls were dried out and hard... No sauce either! The crispy tofu also arrived without the peanut sauce! How are we doing so far? The mango salad was fine, as were the two shrimp dishes, Pineapple Red Thai Curry and Thai Basil. In the end, we turfed out the soup and cold rolls  Down the drain went around $25.00 of $102.00 bill. Won't do this again"}
{"text":"Six of us went there Friday night to celebrate a birthday. We were the only customers. Stacks of cardboard boxes stood somewhere in the middle of the restaurant. OK, maybe that was a one time thing.  There was a long long wait even though we were the only ones there; we thought they were taking care of deliveries. We ordered the lettuce wrap appetizers,  They came with a sweet dip, tasted a bit like honey. We asked if we could have peanut sauce instead. Yes, they brought it and it was tasteless. Finally settled for soy sauce. Main dishes were served one at a time. My dish came and I said, Oh a lot of garlic, the only noticeable flavour. My friend said You like it though don't you? I said, Yes, because I wanted to like it, I didn't want to spoil everybody's good time.  Well her dish, entirely different, was also garlicky and she was able to tell me that they must have burned the garlic -- she's a chef. Another friend ordered soup -- he can't eat hot and spicey and the soup didn't have a 'chili pepper' beside it on the menu. When he told the waiter he couldn't eat it, the waiter said, \"All Thai food is spicey.\"  It was on the bill and not replaced. One person, I'll call her \"A\", liked her main course. We laughed. We had never had such a miserable meal and we eat out several times a month. We continued down College to the Golden Wheat Bakery for coffee."}
{"text":"Nothing special although you can do worse.   They screwed up an order through Just Eat and tried to double bill me. Average food + bad customer service = 2/5 at best."}
{"text":"This place is what Thai food tastes like when all you know is Chinese food. It's just not the same. I asked for a fried egg with my rice, which is a standard Thai addition (I grew up through my teens in Thailand) but the waitress didn't understand what I meant. I asked her if the chefs were Thai, thinking they'd totally understand, \"No, they're Sri Lankan\" she replied. So, if you like Sri Lankan and Chinese style food, this place is fine. If you like Thai, I'd avoid it.  Atmosphere was a minus 5. There was us an another couple in the restaurant and the guy ate with his mouth open like a zoo animal the whole time. Not the venues fault but gross dude, do that at home, outside, whilst eating from the ground."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, inexpensive family meals on the go."}
{"text":"Worst take out ever, made me throw up and was off.  I had the vegetarian platter, curry pad that, and red curry beef. The side of rice was STALE. The beef was too chewy and rubbery. The curry pad Thai was edible. Waste of money ordering from this place. Esp. When it makes you throw it all up later.  Also, I Ordered it off of just eat and tipped the driver in advance, only to have him awkwardly stand and wait for a tip with his hand open at my door.... NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I know two stars is a little harsh, but I'd like to think that after my longstanding history with Urban Thai, I'm entitled to take away their stars.  I literally used to order delivery from them about once a week. Their Pad Thai is really good! Green curry, delicious. Mango Chicken? I love you. If you spent more than $20, you got free spring rolls, and if you spent more than $25 (I think), you got a free Pad Thai as well! Amazing.  Occasionally I'd go into the restaurant for a sit down meal, and I had so many good experiences! Love the food, love the atmosphere, the location, everything.  And then it all changed. One day, a friend and I went to Urban Thai. We sat down, ordered our food, and waited. And waited. And waited, and waited and waited some more. We were the only people in the restaurant. Two people. All they had to do was cook for two people.  Finally our \"waiter\" (who looked about 15) came over and informed us that he had FORGOTTEN TO PUT OUR ORDER IN. So essentially our lovely waiter had been sitting on his butt for the past 45 minutes, forgetting that the ONLY TWO PEOPLE HE HAD TO SERVE WERE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE THEIR FOOD.  Then he told us we'd have to wait another half an hour. This happened at least a year and a half ago and the memories are still vivid in my mind.  If I start to crave their Pad Thai again, I'll get delivery."}
{"text":"This is my favourite take-out place. I order the vegetarian combo for two and it serves at least three people for a very good price. The food is delicious (although very salty - I get so thirsty afterwards!)."}
{"text":"The reason I went in was because they have avocado and peanut stir fry. Not that I ordered it. It just sounded delicious.  So the waitstaff was efficient and friendly enough but I can't say particularly warm. She seem primarily disgruntled and indirectly emphasized that she was working, at work, and not having fun. She did play some great music, though.  For starters, my friend and I split the lemongrass mushroom soup. Full disclosure: this soup is my favourite in the whole world and I assume every bowl will be spicy. This is not the case at Urban Thai. Good, not spicy. OK.  My friend got orange chicken, loved it, and I'll take his word because I am a vegetarian.  I got the vegetarian Malay supercombo, 100% because it had tofu skewers. They were great! (Pretend I added a bajillion exclamation points to that.) And the veggies were amazing, too.  I wouldn't go out of my way to hit up Urban Thai because I have two staple places right where I live, but should I wonder through Little Italy and decide that I don't really feel like Italian (which is normally the case), Urban Thai is for sure on my shortlist. I also think the place has a great decor and lived up to its name.  Plus it's next to Souz Dal, yesssssssss!  For two people, no drinks, tax and tip, I want to say the meal came out to about $40."}
{"text":"Okay 5 stars for the food...3 stars for the delivery service. But don't let the 3 star reviews deter you..the food is solid! We ordered way too much food for 3 people, which included: red curry (on point), yellow noodles (really good with a little curry taste) the roti dish..it was like veggies mixed with some roti that I've never had...it was really good! And then got another noodle dish, wish was more traditional Thai food. Also had the samosas as appetizers..they were free with our order, they were okay, wouldn't get them again. All in all, the food here is realllly good and would highly reccomend it, although you might be better picking up the food due to their delivery times ??"}
{"text":"When I tapped my fingers over to Urban Thai on Yelp just now to write this review, I gasped when I saw the star rating. Am I just an idiot when it comes to Thai food? It's possible? I had a delicious green curry, mushroom soup and pad Thai. I think the food here is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced.   Thanks for Polar Vortex II: Frozen In Ontario and an empty fridge, I scrambled to my Just Eat app for some necessary lunch delivery for myself and my work mate. This place was delivering at noon and was reasonably priced. Why not?! Unlike other peoples' stories, my food arrived exactly when Just Eat said it would... as Just Eat orders usually do. I am going to guess it took them a while to get into the delivery groove... but they're groovin' now, baby."}
{"text":"Ordered via JustEat.ca...  Food came two hours later. Food was lukewarm and dry.  Food is now sitting in my fridge while I think of what to do with it.  Possible options:  1)eat it 2)toss it out window 3)toss it into air dramatically  I'll probably go with option 1 because I'm always hungry, but I will not be ordering from this place again."}
