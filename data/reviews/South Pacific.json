{"text":"I understand the idea of greasy food but the first and only time we tried South Pacific the food  tasted/smelled like old oil.  It was truly disgusting and it's not like I have high standards for Chinese takeout.  Never again."}
{"text":"OK.... sometimes you just want fast food chinese,,,,,, and you don't care about calories or the fact that it clogs your arteries.... it's just overall cheating goodness..  :)  I get the same thing all the time.... twice a year for 25 years!!!!  sweet and sour chicken balls plain fried rice 4 egg rolls chow mein  Don't bother with delivery... takes too long... call in and pick up 20 minutes later..."}
{"text":"Alex is lovely and kind. They have revamped the front waiting area. It's a nice family takeaway place in the neighbourhood.   It's good, quick, inexpensive food. I'll keep going there for sure! The combos are perfect for nights when you don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place should be avoided. Everything we ordered tasted weird and was full of salt/MSG. Even the spring rolls tasted off...how can you screw up a spring roll? The chicken wings had so much hair on them I lost my appetite as soon as I noticed. Chow mein was so-so but again, something about it just didn't taste right. Such a shame because we used to come here all the time for take-out around 10 years ago and it was decent. I guess a lot can change in 10 years. Sadly, won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food. Big portions. Decent prices. Very 'fortunate' to have em in the hood. Thanks South Pacific!"}
{"text":"This is an oddball neighbourhood staple for me now.   Before I start in on my take out eats, I've got to warn you. This place is really bizarre at first glance. Two couches and colours make you think you're waiting in a dentist office, albeit it, a pretty dirty one, with some hula girl art for good measure. There is a small old school cash register, and someone comes out from the kitchen in the back that you can't see in and takes your order. They then shuffle back there again with the handwritten note and begin to make MSG magic.   Wait the agonizing 15 minutes.   Walk back over and grab your goods! $16 for a Dinner For Two! It comes with pork fried rice, spare ribs, a sprout veg dish and two egg rolls. I know what you're thinking! Great deal! Well guess what? This really stretches a lot farther than you'd think! Add a $3 hot and sour soup (mmm diggity) and you're looking at Dinner And Lunch For Two, or Dinner And Lunch And Dinner For One! That last one may or may not be me today... stuff your shaming in a sock. It's a totally respectable three-peat meal, as long as you're into salty grease."}
