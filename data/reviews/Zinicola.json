{"text":"We ate here last week for the first time.  I must say, I was very impressed w/not only the selection, but the quality of the food.  We had the octopus appetizer, and it definitely was one of the best I have ever had.  Delicious, and inventive.  Done just right.  We shared a pasta and the risotto, which were excellent.  The risotto was cooked just like the way we had it in Italy last year, and I loved it!  Very friendly and accomodating.  Very responsive service.  Really enjoyed it and will be going back again soon.    Nice to have a really good Italian place in the hood."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my husband for Valentines dinner.There was a special menu but was delicious. Service was great and I loved how they renovated the space. Definitely will be back. The Tiramisu is hands down the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at @zinicolaitalian for a birthday dinner this past weekend, so wonderful that we forgot to even take pictures of the amazing food  The service was also great, thanks to our waiter Justin and everyone that was just so nice and helpful. We can't wait to go back! I got the short rib but I really wanted to try every single thing on the menu. We were all very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 8. Matt was our server, very attentive and great attitude.  Grilled octopus, fried calamari, and tuna for appetizers, delicious!  Fresh, not chewy, lots of flavor. Salads and entrees were wonderful. Great wine selection. Loved the decor. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off, to the reviewer that was disappointed by the lack of \"Italian American choices\", this place bills itself as authentic Italian. Disclaimer to those looking for Italian-American, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for made-from-scratch authentic Italian food then you have just found a gem. I dated a guy in high school for 4 years with a mom that immigrated to the US when she was in her late teens, learned all her cooking from her mamma in Campo Basso Italy and was never influenced by American cooking due to that fact. This is the first time I have ever had food that rivaled the amazingness that lady used to whip out in her kitchen!  Second off, if you want amazing service with a personal touch and someone who will remember you by face (probably not name at first haha) then ask for Matt. I can't recommend a more down to earth, genuine and attentive server. He sets the bar high and knows so much about the menu.  My friend and I went here for dinner and drinks. We were so impressed and so stuffed. We still talk about needing to go back soon! Come prepared to spend some money in order to experience the menu and the wine/cocktail selection. The price point is very reasonable though for the atmosphere, service, taste and quality of the food and ingredients.   We started with the House Meatballs and the Roasted Octopus. The meatball is perfect and tender. The mixture of veal and beef tastes divine, cooked so that its juicy yet tender. The pecorino was fresh and the sauce was yummy. The octopus was at Matt's recommendation and I was apprehensive but gave it a shot. Wow- so amazing and also had a charred smoky taste. It was delicious.  Next, my friend had the Caesar salad and I had the Beet and Arugula salad. He was super satisfied with his salad and said it tasted like a real Caesar should. My salad was amazing as well, with fresh ingredients and a yummy lemon vinaigrette.   We then split two entrees- the Pappardelle Bolognese and the Short Rib. These were both also amazing. The pasta was out of this world and so clearly homemade. I know the description is kind of basic sounding but I assure you the taste is not. The Short Rib was so tender and yummy. I would highly recommend both.  Finally, for dessert we had vanilla filled cannolis. Delish!  I had a few cocktails and the manager sent us two glasses amazing red wine on the house that paired perfectly with our food. It was a very nice gesture.   Basically, check this place out! Service food and ambiance are all on point."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Zinicola last night with my family and I wasn't impressed. The octopus and calamari were good. I ordered the veal special for $45 and it was so tough I couldn't eat it!!! My son ordered the Lamb chops and it came with only 2!!!!He was still hungry so we asked for more bread!  The pasta dishes were good but the portions were very small."}
{"text":"Eric at the bar was a delight, he navigated me through the menu and gave me recommendations.  I had just left the salon and wanted to grab something before heading home and this spot caught my eye so had to check yelp before heading over and I'm a sucker for house-made pasta so Zinicola it was. With the help of Eric, I ordered the Margherita pizza and Bolognese to go.  I was able to watch my pizza being made and cooked as I sat at the bar, pretty cool but I was disappointed that the pizza had way too much sauce on it, way too much and I couldn't really enjoy it.  I was able to enjoy the Bolognese with homemade pappardelle, it wasn't the best and was a small portion for the price, but it was good.  I may return to try some of the other recommendations I was given, but I would like to see that sanitation grade get a little higher before then."}
{"text":"Was here for a charity event. Did not sit down and dine here. Impressed with the ambiance of the Zinicola.   Event was just passed the entrance. In fact right across from the front entrance was were the event was held. Nice room. There were a variety of appetizers laid out on the table. The Arancini stood out the most. What did they put in that rice ball? Not to mention the Calamari and other appetizers. Just a couple of these were a meal itself. Crispy and so tasty even without the sauce on the side.   Atmosphere was classy and staff was attentive to all attendees at the event. There was an audio issue and staff came to the rescue.   Will definitely be back for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! This place really made you feel like you were visiting in Italy! Not as much from the atmosphere, it was really a modern style restaurant that I don't picture in old world Italy, but definitely in how they treated their guests! Everyone was family.  I visited with my coworkers on a Wednesday evening. We had a party of 17 that trickled in over a period of about an hour. We all started outside with Eric at the bar. Talk about great service!! He was a star for all of us. Kept glasses full, shared refreshing drink recipes for the summer heat and handled our group with professionalism and humor. Just how we like it! Once everyone arrived and had sufficient time to share a cold one, we went inside to begin the dinner service. We did require a shift in the table set up but nothing a few minutes and musical chairs didn't fix. After that, appetizers and drinks were ordered and promptly delivered. I think we tried almost every appetizer and I didn't hear anyone complain. I quite enjoyed the fried calamari. It was crisp, light and a good assortment of tentacles and bodies. Bread was also brought out for us to enjoy.  I asked our server for his suggestion of a pasta entree. He said that the pappardelle bolognese is one of the most popular dishes along with the pasticcio al forno. His favorite was the pasticcio al forno but I quite enjoy the fresh pappardelle noodle so I chose that instead. After drinks, apps and bread, the portion of the pasta was perfect. Not too much and the sauce was seasoned very well. Some bolognese comes off very sweet or the meat mixture can be heavy but this was quite good. Not overpowering in any direction.  I'd definitely like to visit again with friends or family!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  Its really really good. I've been here twice and both times its been a spectacular experience.  Both times we've had the GM stop by our table and inquire about our visit and If the service was okay.  The food was good. So good that half my plate was finished by people other than me.  The Friday I was there, they had a jazz singer in front serenading the restaurant. The ambiance is very nice and cozy.  Service is impeccable. This is one of my top 5 places for charlotte."}
{"text":"Very sadly disappointed by our entire experience here. We had high hopes as we love Italian and actually had our wedding reception in this same space when it was a different restaurant. To say we were let down is an understatement.   To start, my husband and I ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. It took about 20 minutes of waiting for the server to say they were out of the wine I ordered. By the time I got the replacement our appetizer arrived before our drinks and they brought the wrong cocktail to my husband which has zero ice in it.   The food was not good. Cesar salad tasted only of anchovy and I like anchovy but this was really fishy! My husband ordered the black fettuccine. It was so overly salted it was inedible. However after waiting an extremely long time on our food to arrive he didn't want to send it back in fear it would take just as long to get something else. My spaghetti was lackluster and did not taste homemade as the menu described.   All night the servers kept apologizing for the slow or chaotic service. Hey, how about don't apologize just give us good service? When we told our waiter about my husbands overly salted pasta he only offered a dessert. We were so turned off and waited so long for our food we didn't want to stay for dessert. He didn't offer a manager to come speak to us or any other concession or accommodation.   The whole experience was just a let down. We really enjoy our date night and when you have this sort of experience it put a damper on the evening. We will not go back."}
{"text":"So excited that an authentic Italian restaurant  has opened in Ballantyne Village. Dined here last night and food was wonderful  and the service was top notch. I highly recommend . I inquired as to who the owner was and turns out he is also the chef. What used to be Gustos has been totally revamped. So much more warm and inviting now . My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service along with great food, wine, and cocktails. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back.  The menu items we tried and really liked were (Appetizers) House Meatballs, Roasted Octopus (Entrees) Scallops Scampi,  Braised Short Rib. (Desserts) Panna Cotta, Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the Bartender rocks it with whatever you need.  Off the chain...."}
{"text":"Love the owner & staff, but they haven't quite gotten their act together yet. . .it doesn't have an \"identity\". Prices are not in line with what they serve. Trout cooked perfectly and a generous portion. Braised short rib ravioli delicious. . .but for that price, only TWO??? They never officially opened and owner/chef did say they were \"testing the market\". OK, I have a background there, and my advice would be to rethink their pricing. They also need to add some \"specials\", have a featured \"signature dish\" and a \"half-price wine night\". Think the restaurant needs to market itself. You wouldn't know it was there if you didn't frequent Ballantyne Village. Really do hope Zinicola can \"get it together\", Ballantyne Village really needs to get a better mix of restaurants."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful menu. Best steak in town from am Italian restaurant. Fresh pasta was excellent. A little pricey"}
{"text":"Great dinner for a group of 8 of us this evening. Matt was a great server who did an awesome job, the food was just as good.   Highly recommend........."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I really have enjoyed this place. The decor and ambiance are pleasing, and the staff is well versed in the menu and able to make strong recommendations. We had the meatball appetizer both visits and they are excellent. Our first visit, my wife had the seafood rigatoni, and I had the lamb chops. The seafood rigatoni was very good, the lamb chops were above average. The 2nd meal we both had pasticcio al forno and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Drinks were prepared well, and service was all around a pleasure. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Was in town from New York for the holidays and the family decided to check out the new restaurant that opened nearby. 9 of us arrived and we were seated promptly.   To keep the review short; food was great, service was great, overall experience was great.   Recommend: Octopus, Seafood Pasta w/ vodka sauce, calamari. To be honest, everything we tried was delicious. Will definitely be back next time in in town."}
{"text":"Had dinner here when place was only open for a few days Service, Food ,Price and Wine selection were all excellent  Will go back as often as I can Wait staff very personal and the GM came buy and checked that all was well Matt our waiter was excellent!!! Highly recommend to all who like Great food and service and good wine selection"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the restaurant and unfortunately, it's not a place we plan to return to. First of all, when the hostess seated us, she said she was \"pretty sure\" our server was a certain person. She didn't say it in an endearing, I'm so excited and nervous manner, but in a \"I really don't care who it is\" manner. For a Friday night, it was pretty sparse and there were too many staff members walking around, uncomfortably so, looking for tasks to occupy them. One young server (not our own) after seen walking around aimlessly for half of our meal, stopped abruptly to ask us if we needed needed parmesan cheese grated on top of our dishes? Plus, there was an overall \"newness\" about the procedure- I had literally just finished my last bite of salad and three seconds later, my plate is whisked away.  Our server, who was extremely well-mannered and attentive, smelled of cigarette smoke each time he visited our table. I have no concerns about this except when it comes to a person serving my food.  The food was actually the highlight of the evening. We started by splitting the calamari and Caesar salad. The calamari was nicely battered and fried and the spicy tomato sauce it was served with was delicious. Not groundbreaking but well-done. The Caesar salad was flavorful- again, not groundbreaking but well-done. For our entrees, I had the eggplant lasagna, which was delicious. My husband had the cavatelli carbonara, which was the best dish of our meal. For dessert, we had bread pudding and I ordered a glass of Bailey's. The bread pudding was fine, but not particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the pour on the Bailey's was the equivalent of about two sips, but cost $9."}
{"text":"Little Italy in Charlotte !!! Zinicola Restaurant in Ballantyne has the best and most creative Italian cuisine in the Carolinas !!! I recently tried the lamb chops, the red snapper with shrimp and clams and the world acclaimed risotto pescatore !!! All three dishes were exquisite and delicious, but the risotto is by far the best of the best !!! Service, as always, is very attentive and outstanding !!! The ambiance is most enjoyable, and the Italian music makes your dining experience unforgettable. Viva Italia !!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but really expensive for a very small portion. My husband ordered the \"rack\" of lamb which turns out to be only 2 piece of meat and a couple piece of potatoes. Not to mention we waited about an hour to eat and it was served cold. Needless to say, we were disappointed and still hungry afterwards, so we went home to cook dinner.  They also served us bread prior to our meal. The waiter brought us 2 rounds...then took the 2nd round of bread away and gave it to the people next to us and said he it wasn't for us after we touched it already. Smh  It was ok so i give him 2 stars for effort."}
{"text":"We had a team gathering with a dinner at Zinicola at a he end of the day.  We enjoyed an incredible meal at Zinicola.  The atmosphere was laid back, yet Matt's service was outstanding.  Matt paid close attention to all of our needs and had a wonderful sense of humor as well. I highly recommend you stop in and enjoy a great meal... don't forget to ask for Matt, you will be well taken care of!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not for us. The menu was limited and did not offer traditional Italian Americans food. I ordered spaghetti and it was over cooked and the sauce was not great. My BF ordered mushroom risotto and it was bland and looked like slop. The bread was average and the wait for the food and the check was long and unacceptable. There are other decent Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area, try one of those, I do not recommend this place to traditional Italian."}
{"text":"The food was good but ridiculously overpriced! $65 for a 13 oz steak ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? No prices on the menu, so buyer beware... Manager tried to tell me it was comparable to other prices in the area LOL... I've been to Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Firebirds, etc... and had the same steak for half the price."}
{"text":"Really nice place to enjoy family and eat fresh pasta wait staff very attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"I've now eaten at this place at least ten times and had it catered. Every experience has been wonderful. Menu is unique and phenomenal! Staff is amazing. A dining experience that must be tried. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The octopus and the calamari are amazing. Must try. The pizza crust is wonderful, although a little more olive oil flavor would put it over the top. The salads are perfectly dressed. Desserts still need Work - the cannoli cookie was lacking sweetness and the cream was lumpy & the tiramisu was too light - the marscapone cream was smooth but not dense enough for our taste."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to dine here numerous times. Each time I've had the opportunity to enjoy a meal served, it continues to keep improving.  They roast the finest veal, and the seafood offerings are off the charts.  Servings are more than generous, wear pants with expandable waist band."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Ballantyne, which replaced an almost identical eatery.  On the positive side, my husband's calamari was most pleasing as was the wine my daughter chose.   I had a caesar salad which at best was \"run-of-the-mill.\" I requested Cavatelli Carbonara.  I was told to fold in the pasta, as the egg needed stirring from the bottom.  Although I have never heard of doing this, I complied.  The pasta, sauce and pancetta had no distinctive flavors or texture.  It was a blend of muck. I always say, the quality of the bread that a restaurant serves usually is a good predictor of the palatableness of the rest of the meal.  The bread was tasteless and boring.   My daughter ordered a very simple individual pizza.  When it arrived, the waiter asked if she wanted shaved truffles on top.  Here is where we made a BIG mistake.  She answered, \"yes,\" without asking the price of that extra topping.  When I recieved the bill, that single serve, mundane pizza was $37.00...unbelievable.  The server should have been upfront with that information. And speaking of waiters...Our waiter was overlyfriendly and condescending.   The previous restaurant was just as bad, with a similar menu, which makes me wonder if this restaurant wasn't opened under a different name...both not worth the calories or price."}
{"text":"I recently made reservations here on a Friday at 8:30. As a resident of Ballantyne, I was thoroughly excited to try something so close and right in line with what I was looking for, for the evening. We arrived promptly to an amazing atmosphere, the place is definitely set up for great conversations with an open floor plan with a view from the bar of the kitchen. We originally accepted the offer of the bar table but due to it being a tight squeeze opted for the private dining in the back.   The private dining only had one other group and was fairly quiet. We ordered the waitresses recommendation of the tuna crudo and a bottle of Cab, can't recall the name though. I ordered a short rib ravioli and my date ordered the rack of lamb. The service itself was great throughout the night, it then got awkward towards the end.   10:30 rolled around and I asked the waiter what time they closed out of respect. He said 11:30pm but sometimes the bar will stay open a bit later. We asked him if we needed to move but he said we were just fine back there.   I noticed that hours online said midnight for a Friday night but figured I'd ask just to make sure. 11:00pm rolled around and the music was turned off on us. Sure, we didn't immediately order anything else but was in deep convo and enjoying the ambience. After spending $150 in dinner I'd think you'd have the option to do just that. I live in Ballantyne and get that things close earlier hence why I asked.   With the awkward silence and the closing duties getting started we opted to just leave and head over to Duckworth's. Sure we were way overdressed for Duckworth's but it beat the feeling of being rushed out of a restaurant. We ordered a bottle and dessert there and continued our night.   When you have someone ask when you close, just be honest. The facade that we are welcomed to hangout then begin pushing us out just put a bad twist on what would have been a fabolous dining experience. Had a e appeared to be older, I'm sure there would have been a different scenario. All in all, a thumbs up for the pretentious, but I'll personally just dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!, gotta get that out of the way first. From the very attentive hostesses, to the above board dining experience, to an very well thought ambience and design, Zinicola exceeded by expectations on the first dine. The food was delicious, well prepared, and the presentation was superb. I will definitely be back and encourage a visit. What a relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So let me preface this with saying that I gave this restaurant a 5 Star because I believe in what they are trying to do,  however they need to make some changes or others will start giving 3 and 4 stars.  First the Food,  AMAZING!,  really why I believe in them.  They need to be offering this food to the public,  again why I gave the 5 stars.  Second the Service,  lackluster.  The staff needs more experience and more support of either bus people or runners for food.  The positive is they have great attitudes and I can overlook the inability to carry off what really needs to be present for the cost of the menu.    Generally, I think they need a stronger Manager with a more definite vision of service,  seems like their focus is food, and it shows;  but service is as important to showcase the experience.  My family went to a breakfast joint the next morning and my 12, 14, and 16 years old commented that the service was better than the night before.  I highly recommend Zinicola, but am trying to reach out to the owners to get their service act together,  I truly do believe in them."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  The food was fresh and the service was spectacular. We especially enjoyed our server Cassandra. She did an excellent job with the recommendations (mushroom risotto and black fettuccini). I'm not sure how clearly it is marked on the menu, but the pasta dishes come in two sizes, my husband upgraded to the larger black fettuccini, which was a great move because the portion was much more appropriate for his size... And they did not cheap out with the portion of mussels and clams. I had the mushroom risotto, which was divine.... Simply delicious. I definitely recommend it. We finished off the meal with a perfect Panna Cotta, not too sweet.. just perfect.  I would come back  *** Update 3/23/18 *** .... I came back. It's so good, like really good. I got the mushroom risotto, again (it's just that good.) My husband got the Bolognese, which was good, the pasta was a little overcooked, but it was still delicious. The octopus was super tender, and the Panna Cotta was still perfect."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Amazing homemade pasta. The meatballs are de-lic-ious. Get at least 2 orders. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Great bar and wine selection. Perfect addition to Ballantyne Village!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times the food and service were stellar. My most recent visit was two days ago when my husband and I stopped in for dinner before seeing a movie. Because we only had an hour until showtime, we ordered three appetizers and a salad to share as small plates, and without our asking, the restaurant split each plate and replated them beautifully as individual dishes. A small thing, perhaps, but it made for an elegant table and we felt very attended to. Two appetizers were the night's specials, cucumber melon soup that was cool and refreshing if a tad sweet, and truly delicious scallops with a balsamic reduction.  We also ordered my husband's favorite, tender meatballs, and an arugula and beet salad in lemon vinaigrette.  The entree specials sounded so good that I was sorry we were in too much of a hurry to try them. If our waiter, Justin, was disappointed in the size of our meal, he hid it and gave us excellent service.   This is our new go-to place in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Staff is very good. Food is ehh at best. Over priced for serving size and quality. Supposed to have Seaford dish with shrimp, clams, scallops & calamari. NO shrimp at all, minimal others tasted like clam chowder out of a can, serving so small could have eaten three (3). Others meals in party similar. You don't know until you try, don't waste your time or money if looking for quality."}
{"text":"Went to eat with a group from work. One word: EXCELLENT. We were taken care of like you want and expect. The food was fantastic- we had Meatballs, Mussels, and Calamari for appetizers (different dishes). All were amazing, juicy and perfect portions. I got the flounder - and I usually do not eat fish. It was flaky, firm, but moist and incredibly tasty. But the general consensus was that everyone's food was exactly what we wanted. Most importantly, to us, our service was constantly on top of us, our drinks/wine, and any questions we had. Honestly, I will go back in a heartbeat when given the chance. LOVED IT."}
{"text":"the best italian food. to sarah p you should stick to olive garden they have the food that you like. to bentley h you should open a restaurant since you know everything about food please don't complain about high price menu if can't afforded don't go out stay home bea"}
