{"text":"MMMMM...! I've so far tried their Macarons, Croque Monsieur, Almond cookies, Chocolate Almond croissant, Heavy Almond Croissant, some kind of custard croissant thing....and not a single one was a disappointment!! And that's impressive. First of all, this is the only bakery I know that gives you the option between the light and heavy almond croissant to cater to the different preferences people might have. Their macarons are larger than most that I've tried, a little uglier, they look plastic, but they taste great! And I could see how the custard cake would be a hit with many, it's not particularly my favourite, but it is nonetheless of great quality. The man there, I think he's the owner, I could be wrong, is super NICE =) The assistant store manager is the black girl I think....she's nice too, but there's this one girl, she's new I believe, started sometime in September....is COMPLETELY USELESS, SLOW, and should not be allowed to work there =.= Every single time she serves me, I get these anxiety attacks from how unintelligent she is.  So when you go, make sure to take your appetite, wallet, and PATIENCE."}
{"text":"Tasty food but the tables are so jammed together there is no way to have a visit with a friend without competing with the people at the adjacent table. I am not sure why they have club music playing at 11 am in the morning. Will not go back, good food but the environment is not pleasant."}
{"text":"Had a craving for an opera cake -- it is my favourite cake, so I've had at least a few hundred opera cakes in my lifetime -- and ordered one from Jules.   Must say that it was the most disappointing opera cake that I've ever had. It did not look like a proper opera cake and did not taste like a proper opera cake either. In fact, it was closer to how a tiramisu would taste than an opera cake.  This is the only thing I've purchased from Jules so far. But given how disappointed I am, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this tiny place. The food is sooo good, and the best part is the great service. Will definitely be back soon.  The Croque Monsieur what yummy."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee and matcha lattes. They make their baked goods fresh downstairs. Would go back."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up a few snacks. Their cookies were passable and the croissant were subpar. Definitely not consistent with their reviews. To top it all off, their service was terrible. The manager had an attitude when I asked a few questions.  Will never come back. I'd give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Their pastries are amazing, my personal favorite are the almond croissant and the sour cherry danish. Jules also does delivery and everyone at my work fell in love with this place. A little known fact is that Jules actually supplies many of the cafes in town."}
{"text":"The only thing I got here was the heavy almond croissant & I'm not a morning person so at times I was quite unlucky at obtaining one. My sister previously lived in this neighbourhood and I probably made excuses to visit her solely for sneaking into Jules for that goddamn croissant. SWEET TAPDANCING CHRIST I could really use one right now. It's just so perfect. Almonds and custard are two of my biggest vices/sh!t I'd probably die without. Even if I witnessed with my own damned eyes-- someone lacing that pastry with cyanide (apparently cyanide smells like almonds), I'd still eat it by the boatload. It might actually be worth dying for."}
{"text":"Best croissant in the city. In fact they supply other locations and get rave reviews there as well. I've been there on numerous occasions and it never disappoints. Nice little salad selection, quiches and other pasties too. And the beverages are excellent. Small seating area in cooler months/rainy days is a drawback."}
{"text":"A solid place for a low key weekend brunch.  Be advised however that they only have a couple tables and bar stools, so if you're planning a visit with more than 1 companion, you will likely have to wait for a table.  A really tasty roasted veggie sandwich and great lattes though."}
{"text":"Croque Monsieur is the best I've ever had. Bechamel sauce was cream and ham not overly salty. It even beats the one I've tried in Paris after recommend by my Parisian host, which is saying something! Pain au chocolate is fluffy and not too sweet. They do not skimp on the chocolate. I love this place and will have to come back to try their crossiants and other desserts!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab some pastries and was pretty disappointed when I walked into Jules Cafe.  Jules Cafe is a tiny narrow place that sells baked goods, lunch, candy; they also have a coffee bar and very few tables that are cramped together in the back. There was no board up or anything listing their goods or prices when I came here, which left me in confusion. Behind their glass counter there was barely anything left except for a few billion year old looking quiche slices and croc monsieur.  The lady here was very friendly and helpful. I was looking to get an iced coffee beverage as it was boiling hot outside, but they don't offer any iced coffee beverages. I ended up picking out a couple of danishes and a couple of almond croissants from a basket which barely had anything left. For these four small items it cost a little over $10, which I think is pretty pricy considering its size and quality. I've had better!  The blueberry and custard danish were sweet, flakey and good but a tad bit stale. The almond croissant was also flakey and had a nice sweet and gooey almond cream filling in the middle. Unfortunately, the croissants were a bit stale too. I find the staleness quite surprising because of the hype of their pastries here.  Overall, Jules Cafe Patisserie did not impress me. Their croissants and danish were not fresh, the place lacked goods when I was there, and the prices are a bit high at this place."}
{"text":"Almond croissant is really good!! I think one of the best croissant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the pastry is this place! I always come here when I'm on the east side of Toronto. Their croissants are flaky, soft and light, one of the best I've had. The almond croissant is a must have!  I wish they had more sitting space. They recently opened a new location on the west end near Royal York Station which carries all their products and and has much more space!"}
{"text":"Great professional staff. Good coffee. Decent baked goods, but never change the line-up. Clientele tends to be older.  BUT--in summer the temperature at this place feels like it's over 90 degrees, maybe more. Owner shows no interest in providing serious air conditioning for either guests or staff. Ovens heat the place up. Customers complain constantly. Hotter inside than outside. Other places on the street, like Thobors and Starving Artists Café (great!) are cooler, hipper and cleaner.  Used to love this place, but turned off by owner's disregard for his customers and team. Staff are wonderful, great people, and deserve much better. Staff are the best thing about the place. They work hard, are super-nice, and really care. But the owner is complacent and not paying attention--and the street is getting more competitive."}
{"text":"I live in California and was introduced to Jules through a good friend.   Well, I wish she never did! In my two weeks I've been in Toronto, I've been to Jules every two days!!! I buy boxes and boxes of his pastries to give to all my friends and family and they all rave about it and beg for more.   I'm not a fan of anything with fruit, but here I am, gobbling everything from the tarts to the turnovers and the quickly sold out, but always warm friandes.  I feel like I'm back in Paris and everything is deliciously fresh, flakey and not too sweet goodness.!!! It can get busy, so be patient, it is worth to wait. Yes, I'm addicted, and Yes, I gained 5 lbs!"}
{"text":"This place has the best croissants in town, and believe me, I must have tried all them all.  My particular favourite is the custard filled croissant.  Who imagined that anything could be this delicious!  Bravo. Their sandwiches and pastries are also fantastic.   A great go-to place for your morning commute.    It has a small seating area, with about 3 or 4 tables.  It's pretty limited space but I've always managed to get a table."}
{"text":"Delish eclair! Went back a couple of times for this. It's the best one I've ever had, with vanilla bean-specked pastry cream. We also had a couple of pieces of other patisserie and they were also terrific. I haven't tried any of the other menu items but will. Very nice spot."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Their baked goods and breads are phenomenal, always fresh. I love their pizzas on the weekends and their take away pastry selections. My favourit cake is the lemon cake covered by lemon curd, simply amazing. They also cater the goods for La Bohem which belong's to the chef's girlfriend. They are not that big on service and friendliness and I wish they had a larger seating area, but their yummy goods make up for that."}
{"text":"Jules Cafe Patisserie is a nice small cafe. Coffee is good, but it is expensive by considering the shop and the area. Maybe the customers there stay so long in the shop, so the price may be reasonable for Jules Cafe Patisserie. They have salads, pastries, and other baked things. The croissant is good. I do not know why Jules Cafe Patisserie does not show their business hours on their website. I went there around 9:00 and they already opened."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and their quality doesn't wane.  Love their chocolate and almond croissants (we get 12 at a time, lasts us a few days and is still good with a light toasting in the mini oven).  Baguettes are fantastic as well.  Like being in Paris again."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and even better desserts! Cute French patisserie, very authentic."}
{"text":"Yum!  I used to stop by this bakery after school all the time!   My favorite thing to pick up was the Mango Danish! It always had the perfect consistency: light and crisp on the outside, smooth and custardy in the middle with perfectly ripened mangos to top it off!! I could not get enough!  The baguettes were also very delicious, crusty on the outside and deliciously chewy and moist in the middle! This was a perfect way to move on from ACE bakery baguettes! I do believe there were a few times when I bought a baguette sat in my car alone and polished the ENTIRE thing... on my own... yes it is that good..."}
{"text":"I originally discovered this place at the Leslieville farmers market. They have the most amazing almond croissants. The table was filled with a lot of other tempting treats that I was able to resist, but I am not sure for how long."}
{"text":"Place just opened up in the Kingsway, and I have to say, it's really nice to have a local alternative to the big name coffee chains. I had a pretty good latte and a delicious custard pastry (definitely recommend). While the place isn't significantly cheaper than Starbucks (though it is a bit!), the baked goods appear to be significantly better, and you get your beautiful coffee in a mug instead of a to-go cup if you prefer. Cleaner, classier, and has a much more local feel than the other coffee shop options around."}
{"text":"Dropped in to this little cafe for a quick coffee and almond croissant and was pleased with the selection of salads and sandwiches they had. My friend tried the beet salad and lentil salad and was very pleased. My coffee was delicious, and my almond croissant was perfect! Flaky with a bit of stickiness on the outside, and the almond filling was sweet, but not overly sweet or heavy. Just the way I like it.  The staff at the counter was friendly and very kind. Seating is limited and the layout slightly awkward (I wouldn't be able to bring my son in his wheelchair without moving tables and chairs), but it was fine for a quick eat with a friend or two.  They offer samples of the cookies at the cash register, and this works! I was happy to purchase packages of almond cookies to enjoy at home. Yum!"}
{"text":"A very cute little shop on one of my favourite streets.   Settled 2 doors down from Fabulous, Jules is a perfect little french oasis.   I stopped in for treats to take to work on Christmas Eve. Jules was quite hopping at 8 am. You could see a lot of people had made their orders as there were a lot of boxes and bags designated to some holiday celebrating folk. Always a good sign.   After looking over the goods, wanting to try them all, I decided on 4 different bags of cookies. The gingerbread, chocolate shortbread, chocolate and white shortbread, and the madelaines did not last long at work. My office smelled so good, and a lot of \"oh wow!\" and \"ooohhh\" were the overall consensus regarding the treats.   I did treat myself and get a cafe au lait (one of my fav caffeinated bevs). Jules wins big huge bonus points with me on this item as it was super hot and took about 6 layers of skin off my mouth...as every hot beverage should do.   Thank you Jules...I will be back...maybe with my special order!  Note - Jules accepts debit.  Small seating area in back.  Perfect for a little latte between lovers."}
{"text":"Man...now that I've read the other reviews, I really wish I'd gone to Jules myself!  As it was though, poor little me had it delivered.  The only way to improve upon breakfast from a French bakery is to have breakfast from a French bakery while wearing pajamas.  The boyfriend picked out a ham quiche, a raisin pinwheel, a chocolate and a plain croissant.  The quiche was a slice of a bigger pie rather than individually sized but that's fine with me - less buttery pastry allows me to begin to pretend that maybe it's a little healthy!  It was tasty, but I actually preferred Thobor's quiche just down the street.  The raisin pinwheel however was immensely better.  Considering I couldn't force down more than one bite, that's not saying much, but the pinwheel from Jules was very tasty in its own right.    I'm curious to go back and try some of their sweet things, and to see the shop myself!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there recently and had a very delicious ham and cheese sandwich on a fresh baguette accompanied by an AMAZING grape tomato and bocconici salad.  Will definitely go back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Very good espresso-based beverages. At 4pm, their pastries are still fresh-tasting. I had a coffee-flavour eclair as suggested by the barista- I'm happy I took her suggestion! Modest, comfortable, quaint. I will go back again :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in after going to the gym down the street.  Grabbed a croissant and a baguette to go. The croissant was flaky, buttery and deeeeelicious. The baguette was also really, really good. Probably totally defeated my workout, but ...  I didn't sit in, but I saw a small dining area in the back. They had a variety of salads and quiches (my fave) so I'll have to try these items next time.   Yay I'm a fan... until next time !"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with a good cup of latte and nice and flakey chocolatin. Also had their vegetarian croque monsieur which was rich and flavourful."}
{"text":"This place has the best croissants in the city!  I've gone to a few bakeries in search of the perfect, flaky butter croissant.  The coffee is not great, the seating is cramped and tiny tables (4 tables stacked against each other on the south side of the establishment). They also have a \"bar\" stool long table .  It's worth coming for a coffee in the morning on the weekends, just to enjoy the croissants!"}
{"text":"Nice little café with beautiful pastries, if I'm to go by the other photos posted. However, there weren't many options in the display case the two times I visited. I suppose I better get there earlier in the day.   I tried the mille-feuille on my first visit - it was a generous portion but not as delicate as I was expecting. In fact, the layers seemed almost soggy when I put my fork in. Flavours were ok but the pastry cream was a bit thick and heavy.   Today I tried a croissant and a slice of broccoli & cheddar quiche. The croissant was very buttery and flaky - very nice - even better when warmed up. The quiche was very thin, but full of broccoli - although not much cheddar - I think it's only sprinkled on top. However, it was lovely and creamy. I just wish it was thicker, so as to feel more substantial.   Kind of pricey in my opinion, $2.45 for a croissant and $5.95 for a slice of quiche. I don't recall exactly what I paid for the mille-feuille but I remember being surprised at the price. And not in a good way.   I'd like to try their lemon tarts if they still have them, though, because in the photos they look amazing and lemon tarts are my favourite."}
{"text":"Best croissants in the city! Their veggie sandwhiches are to die for! Excellent lattes. This place is my little treat on weekend mornings!"}
{"text":"Great French pastries, desserts and coffee! I'd never had croque monsieur before and loved it; it was stuffed with mushroom and cheese. The chocolate cake slice was also delicious. Great service and ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! I'm officially addicted to their Apricot Tarts, so good, better thank anywhere else and cheaper too. Their sandwiches remind me of Paris, and their almond croissant is the best!"}
{"text":"On Sat and Sunday, they made a brioche bread loaf that is simply amazing!  We bought a loaf and made the best PB&J sandwiches I ever had.  Nice bakery."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best almond croissants!! I've also had a great broccoli cheese quiche slice. Whenever I've gone it's always been very quiet and calm, with friendly staff who are quick to help you out with whatever you need."}
{"text":"We tried to order ICED coffees, the guy served us hot coffees that was burning to the touch. We asked why we got hot drinks when we ordered iced coffees thinking he might've gotten our order wrong. He said he did serve us iced coffee and his reason was that there's ice in the drinks that takes longer time to melt... Apparently some kind of special ice we don't know about. We kind of let it go and walked out the door with our beverages, we opened the cup, there's one tiny little piece of ice that's almost fully melted.  Basically, we didn't get our cold beverages... Not even hot beverages because there was still ice put in the drink. We ended up with Luke warm coffees. Very unimpressed. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Nice little artisan bakery in midtown Toronto. Their apple tart and cheesecake are a must try. I want to try the almond croissant next time I visit."}
{"text":"Worst baguettes, I could have made better croissants myself, without a recipe. Back in Marseilles this quality of bakery would go out of business in a Paris-minute."}
{"text":"Erm...Jules has just landed itself a conditional pass from Toronto health inspectors Dinesafe program. Not cool!! Now that I check out the Toronto DineSafe website seems like this place doesn't have a good track record."}
{"text":"I went on a mission to Thobor's and found out the hard way it was closed on Monday and Tuesday so Jules was the back up.   VIBE  Not fancy. It's really cute that the people behind the counter are actually French and have French accents.   I ATE  Pain au chocolat. The croissant was flaky and soft but I wish the chocolate was more gooey inside. I was starving so it sufficed.  Looks like they have a nice selection of yummy desserts inside as well as some small lunch items like baguette sandwiches, quiche and open baguette.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Jules #1 down. Now to go to the other Jules on Spadina.  A cute addition on the Mount Pleasant strip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to sit down and enjoy a dessert but it wasn't until after we had ordered everything that she said they were about to close..so we had to eat it outside on a cold day. Not cool.  I got chocolate chip cookies which were okay but more buttery than I'd have liked. He got a raspberry crumble-ish tart that was pretty good. The croissants are supposed to be amazing, but I didn't have the best first experience, so I'll try Thobor's next time."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found a French patisserie (bakery) in my neighbourhood. It sits right across from a French bistro et cafe as well. Double jackpot. Jules' reminds me of a tiny patisserie that used to be on our drive home, a long way's away from Toronto.   I played it safe and tried out the croissants et un pain au chocolat (aka. chocolate croissant). Both were pretty good. Just the right amount of butter (which means tons) and crispiness to start your day off merrily. And they are generous with the chocolate in the chocolat croissant.   I also had a quiche that I saved for later in the day. I knew I'd have mid-study hunger pains- It totally did the trick. Crust was overbaked but the eggs, ham and gruyere batter was tasty.   Couple downsides- too hot in there, poor seating options and stiff service. The staff should also speak French and I don't believe they do.   I may be back, peut-etre pour une tarte or a madeleine or something. Place is dangerously close to home, pun intended. Good thing the gym is smack in the middle of that walk lol.   I RECOMMEND: The chocolate croissant aka Pain Au Chocolat :) Hands down, no contest.  EXTRA TIP: Open on Sundays. So is THOBORS, the other bakery next door which gets a higher rating.   Now if I could just get someone to bring me my croissants and crossword puzzles in bed...."}
{"text":"Butter Croissant ($1.80)is A-OK! Really buttery and flaky.. hmmm..crumbs everywhere!! :P   Cappuccino ($2.70) made from strong roast and went well with the Croissant.   On a cold winter day, it did get chilly even the sitting area is at the back of the cafe. The tables are small and really tight together.. a really Parisian feel?   Staffs here are super nice and smiley.   Quiche, sandwiches and soup if you want to have a quick lunch, they all look delicious and fattening good! We are talking about French food! If it is healthy.. then they are not French! :P   There are also some sweet and pastries and cookies for people that prefer some sweetness in life!  There are no prices on the menu written on the chalkboard.. there are no prices anywhere?! Wishful thinking.. no prices not equal to free... :)"}
{"text":"CROISSANT REVIEW: Decent to passable quality.  Solid enough structure (read it doesn't look like a used sock on the floor).  Slightly underbaked, more bready than flaky, no distinctive butter taste, not particularly crisp. I'd like to give it another try fresh out of the oven, tried this one about 11:30 am. I'll mention that with tax the croissant only cost $1.68 which is an excellent price, none of this well over $2.00 nonsense."}
{"text":"I usually go there when I want to get dessert if I'm going to someone's house . Their deserts are pricy but very fresh . And they are very friendly ."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast with two people this morning and came out after lunch. Waited an hour for a pre-made croissant and coffee that ended up being made with bad milk. After almost finishing my mediocre croissant I realized it had burnt through the styrofoam container and was covered with plastic on the bottom. Numerous people came in and left with to go orders while people were patiently waiting at their tables; when asked what the hold up was the owner said \"there are too many people, I can't handle it!\" Needless to say there are hundreds of other coffee shops in Toronto where you will get food that does not make you sick."}
{"text":"I dropped by Jules ONLY to try out their croissants so my star rating is just based on how their croissant rates up to the other places I've been :)  The croissant is quite big in size, but it was disappointing to me because it wasn't flaky.  It was much more of a bready type of pastry than I'd want in a croissant and although I stopped there early in the morning, it didn't hit me as fresh-from-the-oven.  If I'm already in this area, I'd rather hop over a street to Bayview and get one from Rahier."}
