{"text":"Based on the previous reviews and proximity to my place, this seemed like a great place to bring my guest from out of town. The first two items I ordered were not available despite being prominently featured on the overhead menu. I settled on a bbq bacon burger and we decided to split the chili cheese fries. I must have missed it when the memo went around that chili cheese fries are fries with melted cheese whiz and over cooked ground beef sprinkled over them. If you believe this stuff is chili, I have some beach front property in Wyoming you may be interested in. For the prices levied, you'd imagine the food would be a bit more palatable, but I'm pretty sure what I just consumed was a JTM patty on a bun they picked up from the discount past freshness date rack. Apparently the tacos my friend had were somewhere near the threshold of acceptability. I am under the impression this place may have recently changed ownership and/or management (the receipt still shows the old name \"Flame Burger Factory\") and unless it undergoes another change, the likelihood of my return rests in the neighborhood of airborne swine!"}
{"text":"Went here on a tip with my coworker and was pleasantly surprised. Really great tacos, and it was Taco Tuesday!!!!  We were given samples of the meat, I  ended up getting 3 street tacos, and my friend purchased 8! Afterwards, we were given samples of homemade Horchata, which was bomb!!! So cinnamony!!! I highly recommend giving Julia's a try. Plus the Grandmother works there cooking, you can't go wrong if Grandma is cooking in the back too. Don't pass Julia's by, get in there and try some delicious food."}
{"text":"When choosing a mexican restaurant I always look for authenticity and as soon as you walk into this place you can smell the wood burning fire grill. The salsas were really good and authentic. The tacos (both hard and soft looked delicious. I got the asada quesadilla and it was very good. The staff is really friendly and outgoing. The guy at the register was very nice and asking everybody how they liked their food. I will defiantly go back to try the rest of their items."}
{"text":"Excellent mesquite grilled meats! We had the quatro tacos and I thought all of their meats were excellent. You need to try the marinated pork and chicken first. If I had to chose a least favorite it would be the carne asada. Not because it was bad but because the others were so outstanding! Service was top notch by Chris! We are new fans and will be visiting there often."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was even better. Lots of choices on the very clean salsa bar and not any petty charges for extras like guacamole or sour cream. I had the 4 street taco plate so I could try a variety of meat choices. The meats were quality, no fat or chewy pieces, all melt in your mouth tender! I will be back! Thanks, Chris, for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, potato and cheese burrito was huge and tasted great.  Tomatillo salsa was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I went last night, not realizing they had closed already, I showed up 5 minutes after closing. One of the employees (possibly the manager) opened the door, said what would I like, I responded that I didn't know they were close, I'll come back another day, but he said to not worry, to come right in, I told him I work in the restaurant industry and didn't want to be that guy, he totally insisted and he let me order food. The employee did not have to do that, but had a huge smile and wanted me to not worry and get a meal. Super polite, great staff still going strong after close, fantastic customer service. And did I mention this is some of the best carne asada in the East Valley?? Major kudos, thank you Julia's!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we have ever been here and the food is excellent! The service is incredible! This is going to be our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I can't wait to come back here! Their meats are grilled over a mesquite fire. My street tacos were amazing, my daughter's quesadilla was great and my hubby's burger was awesome. I went there because of the smell outside and I'm so glad I did!!!"}
{"text":"Machaca was very good. A bit heavy on the potato content, could've used more egg."}
{"text":"First time here today the food was great the kids loved it,wife had chicken tacos I had steak tacos they were both very good the people were very nice so we will definitely be returning to eat the wonderful food here again"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food restaurant. The customer service is exceptional, the owner is there making sure everything is up to his standard and I even got to meet Julia! I got a taste of all the meats prior to me ordering. Have to admit, I couldn't decide on which meat I wanted, they all tasted delicious and have that mesquite flavor! Their breakfast is also really good and the salsas are full of flavor! Definitely taking my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent mexican food. They let us taste all the meats since it was our first time there. Can't beat the price and value on Taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"Really good chili rojo. Plenty of food for the money. Heard a lot of people ordering in Spanish so it must be authentic. Will definitely be going back,"}
{"text":"I figured I would give this new place a shot (It was formerly Flame Burger). When you first walk in the smell of the Mesquite grill is great. They have a nice selection of homemade salsa's at a self serve station. There's probably 6 different salsa's to choose from. I sampled 3 of them and they were all nice and fresh ranging in different heat levels. I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style (approx $8). It was really good. You can really taste the mesquite in the meat, the refried beans were amazing, they tasted like grandma made them from scratch. I'll definitely go back to try some other items!  As a bonus this place is family owned and I always like to support local small businesses."}
{"text":"I heard from a friend about julias Mesquite grill, and decided to give it a try Wow, how tasty and amazing! You can see the Mesquite grill from the ordering area. Julia was there cooking for us even. I ordered a burrito bowl, the veggies and beans were perfectly flavorful and had a firm texture. Kenny ordered a burger that was very juicy and had that flame grilled taste. Julia's is a feast for the senses!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Friendly staff, and fantastic grub.  I had four soft tacos (steak)... They were delicious.  Good ingredients, made to order.  I have not been so impressed with similar small Mexican fast good joints ( like Filiberto's or Los Favoritos)... The quality at those places is not good, and sometimes the food is just questionable... Not so here!  Julia's rocks!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you enough just how good this place is. Since it opened, it has definitely become one of my favorite go-to spots for a good bite to eat in East Valley. Lots of the Mexican food I've had in the valley is bland and lacks flavor - Julia's seasons the meats just right. That, and they're awesome salsa bar with other condiments makes it awesome.  Long story short, you get amazing food, huge quantities, at a solid price. Definitely love this joint and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! The burritos are HUGE - made to order right in front of you. The burgers are also great, high quality ingredients with homemade flavor. And the salsa bar!!!   If you're looking for a cheap, good meal...you can't beat Julia's. It's a new weekly tradition."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time on Taco Tuesday but ended up getting a bowl for some reason.  Well worth it anyway at a price of $6.99 for a huge bowl probably comparable in size to Chipotle.  I love my Chipotle but this place probably has it beat with their super flavorful marinated meats and top-notch prices.  For $6.99, I not only got the bowl but also a side of chips...and then a free refill on the chips.  They have a help-yourself salsa bar on the side.  Great value, I would return often if I lived closer to Chandler."}
{"text":"BEST HORCHATA I'VE EVER HAD! THEY MAKE IT THERE, NOT FROM POWDER I had a taco and a burrito, they are made to order. great smoky flavor! cheese, sour cream and guac are extra. family run business come support the locals!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife just came in for the first time today. I got a steak and marinated pork burrito with rice and beans all up in it........delicious  She got the steak and barbacoa with rice and beans plate. ......she loved it The salsa in rip your face off hot....mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Very good tacos and burritos. I tried the four taco meal with spicy pork, marinated chicken, barbacoa, and carne asada. I liked their option for toppings, including cheese and lettuce and they make your food in front if you, cafeteria style. My husband had the barbacoa burrito and he loved it."}
{"text":"OMG!!! We drove past this restaurant many times, very colorful. Reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine. I am a coupon queen and remembered we had a 2 for 1 in my entertainment book. I was really hungry and said \"Let's try it, I have a coupon.\" OMG!!! Who cares about a coupon. You walk in and feel like your their family. If your not sure what you want, you can sample the meats or they will help you decide. This is like a Mexican Subway. You pick ALL your meats, cheeses, vegs., everything that you want in your burrito. And it is a HUGE Tortilla!!! The Carne Asada, Chili Verde and the Chorizo/Egg to die for. Salsa Bar included for free. Try it. If in doubt, use a coupon."}
{"text":"I have gone here many times before and never had any issues but tonight was horrible. I ordered my burger and while I was waiting another customer got his burger and it was wrong. I watched him grab the bun and show the guy behind the counter it had cheese when he asked for no cheese. The guy behind the counter took the food back then I watched them just add bacon onto that burger that another customer had touched and say that my food was done. I was shocked that they tried to give me food that another customer had touched.. absolutely disgusting. If you go here make sure you watch them closely while the cook your food."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  The meats are all very good and the salsa bar has a great selection! The guacamole is the BOMB!!  Definitely a must have!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and Mexican food. Friendly service. Love the mesquite smell from even a block away. The bacon guacamole burger is awesome but my husband can't get enough of their Mexican food. Best of both worlds"}
{"text":"Smashed Chipotle by far. Enjoy eating here on all days. Taco Tuesday is just a start. Food is awesome.  Highly recommend it to all authentic Mexican food lovers. !!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here! It's a casual restaurant, very clean and friendly! We loved the salsa bar too."}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday, can't go wrong with $1.50 tacos and our favorite go to spot. I highly recommend the carne asada tacos. Although the pork and chicken are tasty as well. :)"}
{"text":"We probably wouldn't have stopped into this place for lunch if we didn't have a coupon from the entertainment book. It's in a virtually empty shopping center, which isn't exactly a prime location. And the outside of the building looks a little crazy with all the bright colors and flags. But they're trying really hard--they really want you to notice there's a restaurant there.   You can smell the smoky mesquite from the parking lot. This place is a lot like a fast food restaurant. It was previously an El Pollo Loco, so there's a lot of that influence left over, but it's also very \"mom and pop\" inside. We started perusing the menu board, and the owner--a very friendly and helpful guy--asked if it was our first visit and offered us samples of the different meats. The flavors are FANTASTIC. You order your Mexican entrees assembly-line style like you would if you were at Chipotle or Subway, and the burgers come with combo options. The prices are great, and they have specials going every day. They have a huge salsa bar--it was fun to try all the different options on there. Everything was clean. We ordered Mexican and we were very pleased. We think we'll stop by again another time to try out the burgers. They've got to be great cooked on that mesquite grill.   The friendliness of the staff made all the difference here. They great service by the employees made us want to come back and give more business to the local guy. All in all, it was a terrific fast lunchtime experience."}
{"text":"This place smells great: mesquite grilling.  Brought out the carnivore in me and was rewarded by ordering the asada burrito enchilada style with verde sauce.  Yum!  Manager very friendly and accommodating.  Had items on menu for my vegetarian friend as well.  I look forward to trying other choices but the steak asada is definitely the way to go here."}
{"text":"This place has delicous Mexican food that not only tastes great, but is a great price! Ive been to soooo many places in AZ and nothing satisfied me...My boyfriend loved it the first time we found it that we went back twice in 1 day! Dont be fooled by the graphics on the windows with specials...its what's inside the place & what goes into your tummy that counts!!! Oh, yes! They have burgers here & theyre delicous too! Our favorite dish is the burrito bowl. So filling I usually only eat half of it. I also add the fresh guacamole (extra cost but fresh!)"}
{"text":"Great food..worth stopping! Friendliest staff ever...Great marinated pork burritos! Don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! The service was great and its very clean! The carne is my favorite. I haven't tried the burgers but my friend said they were good!"}
{"text":"We recently discovered this place since they moved to their new location at Warner/Arizona.  Love it. Everything is fresh and so good, but my husband and I have gotten hooked on getting taco salads there, and run over there about once a week."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff, and fair pricing. Definitely will be eating here regularly!"}
{"text":"Delicious an refreshing take on classic mexican food . Authentic Mexican Food tailored to spoil Americans :) My new favorite spot"}
{"text":"The building doesn't do it justice we always drive by but never stopped. Finally stopped in last Saturday night. We were promptly greeted asked if we had been there before when we said we were first timers, they promoted the samplings.  It was like a buffet of samples.Love that they do that, you know right then what you have a taste for and don't leave disappointed! We ended up getting variety of their tacos and their menudo (Friday -Saturday only.) Outstanding menudo! The salsa bar is awesome, love the green chile sauce. They let us know they have daily lunch specials for 6.99.  All the staff was friendly and nice little place. You have to give them a try you will want to become frequent visitors. We know we will!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great. They are always friendly. The food is very good and affordable. .99 cent breakfast tacos on tasy corn tortillas are my favorite at this time."}
{"text":"We just got breakfast burritos and the potatoes weren't fully cooked. They looked and smelled good but definitely not that great. Such a disappointment. Maybe their other stuff is better. Giving 2 stars only because everything smelled yummy"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing people who run it. I love this place. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed. And I you're like me, add into your weekly rotation."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Amazing service, truly talented kitchen :)  and it's rare for a real mexican restaurant to have quality vegetarian options! I got a burrito earlier today, best one I've had in years. We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here last minute,You get EXACTLY what you pay for, delicious food, great service, fun place. Gives chipolte a run for their money FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Trying to find real good Mexican food in Arizona is next to impossible. Every time I hear \"hey let's go to filibertos\", I puke in my mouth. Growing up in the valley in California has really gotten me spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Julia's is the answer to my long awaited prayers. My first time in, I got to sample all the meats . I am there at least 4 times a week now. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Really good - seems fresher than Chipotle, with several more meat selections.  I think everybody enjoyed what they had.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fantastic food, I was so impressed with their service! A man (who I'm assuming was the owner, or maybe a manager) took my order. I ordered 1 burrito, nachos, and a green chili burger for my group. They prepared the nachos and burrito in no time, but the burger took about a minute longer to cook (which is understandable). I sat down to wait for the burger. Then the man who took my order noticed I was waiting, and gave me a free soda for my time! They were all very friendly and considerate. I will definitely be a regular customer at Julia's."}
{"text":"Visiting from Kansas City, glad we tried it.  Hard shell tacos were a hit and one in our party of 7 got a mesquite-grilled hamburger.  Great flavors and nice value - less than $8 per person. We are leaving full & happy."}
{"text":"This is our new Friday night nosh. It may look like a dive, but this converted diner does tacos right! We haven't tried the burgers; just the tacos and burritos. I highly recommend the pork."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  The food is a cross between Mexican and bbq - trust me, it's a glorious union.  The carne asada is amazing, everything I have tried had been good."}
{"text":"Praise God for the A-team! Just be aware, if the A-team isn't there, the C+team doesn't know how to refill the Coke Freestyle machine.  It was out of all diet drinks except water.  They  worked on it for about ten minutes and gave up.  Did they offer any kind of apology or explanation? Nope. They just left it to me to figure out that it still doesn't work.  And I'm not drinking water when I paid for a large soda..  The food is still awesome, but they lose a star from me for bad service.  This is not the experience I'm used to having here.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but it kind of hurts when someplace I love and have positively raved about does such a shit job.  I think in future I'm going to look and make sure the A-team is on before I come in."}
{"text":"yes... yes again.  Family run place that makes sure you leave with good food.  The burgers are great, the Mexican food is fantastic.  Go here... it's goooooood."}
{"text":"Great food.  Fast Mexican food place, with a great selection to choose from. Without the fast food taste. Great Salsa bar."}
{"text":"When I entered the line seemed to bizarrely start at the far end away from the door. I was then informed if i wanted a burger i instead needed to go to a different line which was the only register. This register was manned by what looked to be a twelve year old kid who was insanely slow at his job. He started serving people from the other line before helping me. After ten minutes of waiting, and being cut off multiple times such that I was further behind in line then where I started, and people who arrived after me already getting their food, I just left. The food might be good, I have no idea, I wasn't even allowed to order."}
{"text":"This is excellent food! They have mesquite grill that really makes the whole neighborhood smell tasty! The burritos are big and tasty and made to order. I really like the asada (beef). The chicken has some kick to it too. The flour tortillas are amazing and these might be the best refried beans in town. If you're unsure of what sides or meats to get, ask for a sample! The burgers tasted awesome with that mesquite. The customer service is great and they've all been really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good breakfast burrito and Julia's did not disappoint! I knew it would be good the moment I stepped out of my car and I smelled the wonderful aroma of mesquite in the air. I had an extremely delicious chorizo breakfast burrito with some of their great red sauce in the side. Look forward to coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"I live in California but make it a point to stop in here when I visit my mom. I have had tacos, carne asada burritos, breakfast burrito, rolled tacos, and pork burritos so far. I have yet to be disappointed. The meat is always favorable and I have always been happy with the serving size. As a matter of fact the burritos are pretty big.  The staff has always been friendly and offer samples if you want to sample the meats before ordering. Sometime I wasn't to order the hamburger but when I get in line I feel compelled to order Mexican food.   I'll be back next time I'm in town. The only negative, and it's not really that bad, is the price..They are a little higher prices than a lot of fast food style restaurants, but comparable to Chipotle. Lunch for two today was $22. That was for two burritos and two drinks. But it's worth it. I forgot to mention the home made salsas. They are pretty good also and there is a good variety to choose from."}
{"text":"There's a lot of places you can get Mexican food. Especially in Chandler, AZ. However, this place stands out as one of the most unique to me. It has to do with how the food is cooked, and their true to their name-no fake grill marks here. Lol. You can really taste the mesquite smoke and flavor, and I could see flames coming up from the grill, since you can get a pretty nice view from behind the counter.   The service is always great here. Also, they run specials throughout the week. You don't want to miss Taco Tuesday! :)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  I asked to substitute fries because I can't eat rice and I hate beans.  I just wanted 1 taco and maybe 4 or 5 fries.  I can order 4 tacos, beans and rice combo and a side of fries.....which will having me throwing in the trash 3 tacos, beans, rice and half an order of fries.....WASTING food!!!!  Every place I have gone makes exceptions for bariatric patients but not this place.  Well, I didnt buy anything.  Not my first time here but you can be sure that its my last.  I will go the places that makes ALL customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"Had the Monday special, rolled tacos.. outstanding!. The salsa is amazing, and I know my salsa. The rice was great, beans were pretty good. I am not a big bean fan so that is saying something.  Best part, they were not stingy with the guacamole!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the ambiance and the hospitality you feel in this home cooked style Restaraunt. The food is amazing with the mesquite wood flavor in every bite. If you ever want crazy good Mexican food this place is a must try. Thank you Fred for all the hard work you do."}
{"text":"First to start the worker couldn't get my order right what's so hard of a burro de carne asada.. The asada was old really hard reminded me of taco bell meat lol will not be back"}
{"text":"Just tried Julia's today and it was amazing! We went for taco Tuesday and everything we tried was fantastic. My favorite was the carne asada super tender and flavorful. We will definitely be back! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Good food good atmosphere, And pretty good prices too. I am a fan of Mexican street tacos, burritos and just about anything else edible south of the border...This place is Authentic from the outside in!  The big guy at the front counter could have a little bit more personality, Especially for a place to size and void being privately owned...but hey maybe after reading this he'll smile a little bit more!   Otherwise, a solid bet for lunchtime or even dinner."}
{"text":"this is a nice family owned place.  I had a marinated chicken burro with black bean and guac.  It was huge and really tasty.  My daughter has the carne asada chicken tacos.  The hardshell tacos are not greasy like most places.  The carne asada is simple and tastes like mesquite grilled steak.  The place was a hit and we will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in from out of town based on others positive reviews. This is a great option for a quick casual meal. The menu is sizable, we shard chicken and beef soft tacos, hard tacos and a quesadilla. The salsa was light and fresh, the tacos were fantastic and the staff was friendly! They do also have a salsa bar, but there were no labels to indicate what was what (heat wise). We ended up trying a couple options to find the right fit. Reply a great place and we've already recommended it to our friends and family that are local to the area."}
{"text":"My burger was delicious and the chile verde tacos were yummy too.  Recomment this great value."}
{"text":"This is by far one of our favorite places... Sooo good every time we go. All of the meats are great, but the marinated pork is normally my go-to... and in a burrito bowl."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Julia's on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. My husband had a carne asada burrito. It was huge and he said it was excellent. I had the street tacos and chose four different meats to try: carne asada, marinated chicken, green chili pork and barbacoa. All of the meats were very tasty but my favorite was the barbacoa and my next favorite was the marinated chicken. All of meats tasted fresh and flavorful. I did not have a \"sodium hangover\" like i did on the few occasions I have eaten at Chipotle. We are looking forward to going back to try the burgers next time."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It has similar set up as Chipotle but with more flavorful food and selections of meats. Just seems way more home style Mexican than Chipotle ever will. They also offer tacoas, quesadillas, nachos, burgers and Carne Asada fries. I mean! Come on. It doesn't get better than that.   Lastly, the service is also great, which you know is a HUGE part of my reviews.   This place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"First time visit today, wow! The marinaded pork was off the hook!! Simple burrito design that's authentic Mexican with a quick serve vibe. I cannot wait to go back! Treated well by the workers and was offered samples of anything we wanted to try. All meats tasted amazing! Try the marinaded pork"}
{"text":"First visit was on taco Tuesday .  Loved how they sampled every meat they had to offer. Starting with The delicious tortilla , meat, fixins and ending with a great salsa bar. The customer service was excellent. I left very happy and will be back !!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stop on my way home. I've tried their tacos and burritos, both were very good. Each time I've went in, they've been very friendly. The only complaint was my husband ordered nachos and the sauce was so hot, it was almost inedible. Might just be the way they make things, but he didn't ask for any salsa on them. Otherwise, all my experiences here have been wonderful."}
{"text":"Good grilled burger spot. Nice smell of grilled goodness when you walk in.   I tried the Green Chile Burger (they spell it with a chil\"i\" but that should be more for the chili you put on fries or chili dog). The burger seem to be about quarter pound in size, it had one large roasted green chile(be nice if it was more spicy) split in half,  nice thick cut bacon, pepper jack cheese lettuce onion and tomato. Very good burger (once i added mustard) didn't blow my mind but it was tasty and fresh.  Had waffle fries which were good as well.  Place is very simple inside, fast food/order then pick-up type place with plenty of seating.  I sampled the 6 salsas they had, they were pretty good as well (nothing real spicy though), i am gonna have to come back and try the Mexican food."}
{"text":"Visited Julia's for the first time tonight. I really like that you can get burgers and Mexican food at the same place. I had a hard time deciding what to order. I wanted a burger but they were assembling tacos and burritos and they looked so good. I ended up getting a burger. It was delicious!  Big patty and made to order. Fries were regular but good. I can't wait to come back and try their tacos and burritos.   Service was good. Employees very nice. My new go to place."}
{"text":"Tried every breakfast taco on the menu cause they were cheap,  I was particularly hungry and couldn't make up my mind. Wasn't disappointed on any one. I surprisingly ate the lot!  Lol.  The homemade salsa bar was really good, a lot of flavor With just the right amount of spice. My wife had the cheeseburger and loved it."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this restaurant. I have tried it a few times, but not worth returning. Price point set too high, no children options. What really gets me is the overpowering use of a strange spice that takes away from the meat flavor."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a good burrito.  Every morning they make fresh horchata and the breakfast burritos are made fresh on the grill.  Even though the portions are huge, I can't seem to get enough.  The employees are really friendly and a joy to be around.  I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was even better! It kind of reminds me of a Chipotle type restaurant, only with burgers too.  We were very impressed!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I wish they would use the exhaust fan because I smell like smoke when I leave. I've had the Mexican food and the burgers and everything has tasted awesome"}
{"text":"Place is awesome!  Food is delicious and prices are very reasonable!  Been there twice in 3 days."}
{"text":"good place to eat! they use good meat unlike other places. I eat here all the time. ive tried most of their menu, I can say it is really all good!!!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious, carne asada my favorite!! Enjoy the variations of beverages. Clean environment."}
{"text":"went here for lunch once and as soon as you walk in the door there is a heavy mesquite smoke smell!! this is a GOOD thing!!! the food here is great! The staff was friendly and seemed to know the customer that came in and greeted them with a smile!!"}
{"text":"food is decent but english is the second language. my order has been messed up more than once so i stop going."}
{"text":"We love this place. Whenever we visit from Minnesota, Julia's is a must-stop. We like the burrito bowls and the burritos. Make it any way you like it, and load up on spicy homemade salsa, roasted peppers, and fresh pico at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and the staff rocks. We have had breakfast and lunch here if your hungry your in the right place portions are huge ...."}
{"text":"As I was out one day and not familiar with this part of Chandler, I used Yelp to find a nearby drive-thru. Based on Julia's reviews and photos I decided to swing in here! As I curved though the drive-thru, there was no menu board and the speaker looked like there was a sign on it at one time. I kept driving around to the window, where I was greeted by a Spanish speaking lady. She went and got someone to come help me. The young girl that came to help was exceptionally friendly. She said they actually don't have drive-thru. When I told her I only came thru because of Yelp, she said with a smile, \"I know. It's very misleading.\" Unfortunately I couldn't go inside because I had my dog with me so I said I'd come back another time. The young girl was quick to say she'd be happy to assist me anyway.  I ordered a Carne Asada enchilada platter and 4 chicken tacos (they are small). The tacos were very good. The enchiladas, not so much. We couldn't figure out why we couldn't taste the meat. They were covered in red sauce so it wasn't as obvious as you'd think. I moved the enchilads out of the red sauce and opened them. They were empty!!!! There was nothing inside the tortillas!! It's not inexpensive either. I spent $18 on the two meals. I will not be returning. I do feel I need to repeat, though, how very kind the young girl was that helped me."}
{"text":"Went to Julia's today with a coupon that you get in the junk mail file for by one dinner and get one free if you buy 2 drinks. On Fridays and Saturdays they offer Pozole & Menudo. I ordered a large pozole. It came with tortillas or chips. I chose the chips and it was a pretty big bowl of pozole. The pozole was fresh and delicious . They also have a salsa bar with onions jalapeños mixed onions and cilantro. The salsas were fresh and ranged from Mild ( sweet) to really hot. I chose the hot salsa and it is hot! Roasted chilies and was excellent. The service was friendly and fast. I would return for pozole any time... well unfortunately only on Friday's  or Saturdays since that's only when it's offered. I might go back and try other things on the menu too."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Came in for some tacos on a Tuesday and walked into an amazing mesquite aroma.  Wound up with a green chili burger and 1 taco, both were  amazing! They let me taste all the different meats before making my choice and let me tell you it was a hard one. A+ customer service,  Plus I love the fact that the are Family owned and operated! Definitely  a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. The quality of tortillas, salsas, and of course carne asada is fantastic. The staff is very friendly, and the menu has some unique items I haven't seen anywhere else, like breakfast tacos and chilaquiles! I hope this place only expands to more locations, its a refreshing change from the usual..."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, great smell of wood smoke.  Food was good, not great.  I had the asada burrito, tasted breakfast tacos, and mixedbtacos.  Wish I had tried the burger as I think it may have had a more smokey taste.  Will return, but might not drive across town for it"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Awesome breakfast tacos. Awesome owner. Good stuff. 99 cent tacos baby! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for the first time tonight. We were waited on by Julia's granddaughter. She was delightful and gave us samples of everything to try since we were first-timers. I got the street tacos and my husband got a burrito. The standout was the red chili... Delicious. A ton of food for the price. I'm so happy to have found such a gem so close to our house. I see many more tacos in my future."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I dang near gave this place a five star. But here is why I did not. My family stopped in at this establishment early afternoon and this place was already completely out of burgers. This could mean several things. They didn't order enough, they didn't prep enough, or their burgers are just that dang good. I'm looking forward to going back to get me a burger. We ended up with authentic taco plates and nachos. And this food was so good! Their prices are slightly higher than if you were to stop into a taco stand. But these people will hook you up with extras on the toppings. They also have a good toppings bar. Hopefully next time I can lift this four star to a five."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA., decided to try this new place.  GREAT DECISION! !.  Very clean,  fresh ingredients, each item very flavorful.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito was awesome and exactly what I was looking for. Very big Chipotle sized burritos and lots of other goodies.  Sauces are tasty and hot!"}
{"text":"Julia's is like a family owned, chipotle style setup-but with far more excellent food and service!  The food is out of this world.  It has breakfast burritos, fresh juices, tacos, and burritos that look like it could feed three people (I'm a petite gal mind you).  The recipes are like their grandmas own recipes handed down.  The horchata and watermelon juice are so refreshing and not watered down or artificial in flavor.  The burritos are hot off the grill-we always like the carne asada.  Lastly, the dining area is a quaint cafe with lots of tables and even outdoor patio tables.  Service is friendly and fast.  Salsa bar -there are so many choices for toppings.  We are so glad we found this.  Cheers to trying new foods and places!"}
{"text":"This unassuming Mexican joint that serves burgers is actually pretty damn good! I found this on Yelp and decided to give it a whirl considering all of the positive reviews. The burritos are fresh with a lot of condiments to choose from in the salsa bar: 6 different salsas, whole roasted jalapenos, pickled onions/carrots/jalapenos, cilantro and limes. The tortillas are homemade and everything is cooked to order. I would usually get either a fajita burrito or the egg and potato breakfast burrito. I have quite an insatiable appetite, but it's loaded with so much food it's difficult to finish. The people there are pleasant as well. I'm going to miss visiting this place after I move..."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place for the great food and awesome customer service but unfortunately we're not able to come here as often as we'd like because we moved out of the area. Julia's is a unique place in a town where there's a large number of taco shops. They distinguish themselves with fresh ingredients and delicious food."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place several times and they are always busy.  Now I know why.  For good, inexpensive and a lot of fresh grilled mexican food, this is the place to go.  They were grilling orders so it took a few minutes to get our food, but worth the wait.  They have a little salsa bar which was tasty.  We had the taquito platter and they served us 5 large (not your average sized), taquitos.  We also ordered two tacos.  We did not expect beans and rice with both of those platters.   If you want fresh grilled mexican food, you must stop by.  Bring an appetite because their portions are large."}
{"text":"I work right up the road so I always love coming to this place. Tried the taco salad (black beans, rice,  grilled chicken, lettuce, veggies, Pico, and hot salsa, cilantro and onion optional but recommended)  for the first time. Damn! This is the bomb! Everything is good but I think this is what I'm getting from now on! Washed down with a bottle coke!"}
{"text":"Went last Friday night for my first time. Was on my way to Jimmy Johns, but decided to try this out. It smells fantastic when you walk in. The gal was really helpful and gave me a sample of both kinds of chicken, the steak, the Barbacoa and it was all good and made it hard to choose. I ended up choosing the spicy chicken taco salad. It was a very generous sized salad. The gal then gave me a sample of the horchata that her Grandma makes from scratch. It was delicious!! Had a great experience and will be going back to try the burgers!"}
{"text":"The red burrito and green burrito are very delicious and very filling.... customer service was awesome!  Definitely will be back!  Restaurant located at the corner of Warner and Arizona Avenue."}
{"text":"The mesquite smell when you walk in gets your tummy growling. I got a burger and it was juicy, greasy, messy goodness. Ordered fries and they were just good shoestrings, nothing special. Burger with cheese, fries, small drink was less than $10. Will be back to try the Mexican food because it looked good too."}
{"text":"Best customer service we've had in a long long time. They were willing to make off menu rolled tacos for my daughter, very delicious! The carne Assad is very tasty, their salsa bar is great. The al pastor was great as well, and how can I forget the aguas frescas! Horchata and jamaica were the real deal."}
{"text":"So delicious and for the kid who doesn't like Mexican food ( i think she was switched at birth!), they have hamburgers that satisfy her. Love their bowls with carne and the grilled corn is to die for! Bought 3 $7 vouchers and look forward to using them up quickly!  Only complaint is the semi slow service. They make everything custom to order so it takes a bit longer but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. They gave us samples of their various meats since it was our first time there. They had a large selection and all of them were yummy! My husband  said the burger was excellent. On a future trip I tried the burger and thought it was decent but much prefer their Mexican food. The mesquite flavor really brought out the flavor of the fresh meat. Several sauces to choose from to go on your salad, burrito, taco or whatever you choose. Good spot with good prices. Over time and multiple visits, we found that there isn't consistency of food and flavors."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD! Sit down restaurant quality and freshness in a fast food setting...and all the free pico de gallo you can eat...yummmmmmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my 2 sons are here eating and I'm telling you now the best in town they use mesquite wood for there meat !! Filibertos who????!"}
{"text":"This place was really good, went for taco Tuesday and it was definitely worth it. The hard shell tacos were better than any I've ever had. Their salsa bar was really great as well. I will definitely be back.  I just wish they didn't charge extra for cheese and sour cream!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was drive through - it isn't but you wouldn't know that by the set up and drive through window.  Wanted to pick up some rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole for my daughter and Filibertos was to far out of the way.  It took FOREVER.  Was EXPENSIVE in comparison to what I usually get her and she didn't like it.  Barely picked at it.  Even though the location is convenient I won't be back."}
{"text":"The sign doesn't exactly draw you in. You think there's a drive through, but instead there's a broken menu and a pile of chopped wood. The menu is sort of amateurish, and not exactly easy to gleam what else they have besides burgers...BUT the food is amazing.   I had no idea where to start here so I just asked the lady behind the counter. She said burritos are the most popular here. So I got a burrito. Very \"chipotle\" style where they have the meats, salsas, cheese, and other various toppings to choose from and they put it together and you're good to go. This burrito is better than Chipotle.   I'm actually sad I ventured into this place. It's too close to my place therefore it's too tempting to keep away and I'll get fat by coming here way too much."}
{"text":"The burgers are honestly to die for. I couldn't believe how good they were. Someone told me they used to only sell burgers. Try the guac burger. I bought two it was so good. Get seasoned fries too."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out.  Our family was SOOOO glad that we decided to give it a chance.  Awesome service - very friendly!  Food was awesome - the meat (especially the marinated chicken) was excellent, very flavorful.  All the extra's were very good - tortilla's, rice, salsa, etc. Very affordable prices and clean restaurant.  After one visit, this has become one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Such good food and service! It was our first time here and they gave us samples of all the meats which was delicious. I had soft tacos with grilled chicken. all the toppings were great on top. My kids loved their chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Overall:  Really solid Mexican food with a bit of a Tex-Mex spin (burgers).  Food:  Really good, although they were out of the burgers when we got there (it was a Thursday evening)...which my wife was really Jonesin' for.  The pozole was really good, as was the quesedilla and tacos.  Price:  Very reasonable.  We got a ton of food for three people (couldn't' finish) and spent about $32 if I recall.  Service:  Nice people working there and pretty accommodating to make sure you get the food you want when ordering.  But service is pretty fast-food oriented and the tables didn't seem to be getting bused / cleaned much.  Atmosphere:  A bit lacking... pretty sure it's an old fast-food restaurant that has had basically no updates to align with the current owner/restaurant/offerings.  Most signs, etc. hand-made.    Net:  Good stuff across the board.  Inexpensive (maybe $11/person? for tons for food).  We'll be back and will be making sure to get the burgers next time.  Tip:  If you're really craving the burgers (which seem to be a fav of many)... recognize that they can and do run out... you might want to call and see if they are still serving them right before you go."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the whole in the wall look & the vacant building around. The food is awesome. This is one of my favorite burrito places. I almost exclusively go here. The steak & bacon burritos are our favorite. The burgers are ridiculously flavorful. They cook them on real mesquite wood. You can smell it a mile away. Imagine it if you will. The labor, the passion, the cost to cook on wood & pass that flavor in to the customer. And the service is good."}
{"text":"Wow, what a little gem.  Not your typical strip mall fast Mexican joint.  You smell it when you walk in and get a whiff of the Mesquite.  I had the green chile burger with fries.  It was large and tasty, and the fries came with a great spicy seasoning.    My son had a breakfast taco, which was great.   Food was ready in about 10-15 minutes after ordering.  $10 or so.  Total bargain.  Two minor regrets:    1) They really need to serve ketchup in something other than little packets, which were annoying and bad for the environment.  2) They need to open a new branch near downtown Phoenix, so I can frequent it more!"}
{"text":"Very authentic cooking, zero ambience, and great for lunch. I like the quatros tacos and the posole on Fridays and Saturdays. The salsas are great as are the red and green chile. The burrito bowls are excellent and they will add in all sorts of fresh ingredients. This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix/Chandler."}
{"text":"Stopped at Julia on a Saturday afternoon with the kids. It was ok. My daughter and I like to think of ourselves as Carne Asada experts, so we decided to give this place a shot. Like my 3-star rating, it was OK. I wasn't blown away by any means, it was good.  I had an all meat Carne Asada burrito with guacamole and lettuce only and it was decent."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The owner is right there making your food for you. Family owned place. Original food, he smokes or cooks the food with mesquite wood so the meat has good taste to it. I try to go there a couple times a month"}
{"text":"I visited their Mesa location. The service was great. The food was amazing! My favorite part of the whole set up is that you can see all your food being prepared right in front of you. You can tell it is fresh and authentic. The burritos are huge so I went with a bowl instead. I chose their green chile pork and was not disappointed. Their guacamole is great! It is open seating. I have three kiddos and I would bring them here with out hesitation."}
{"text":"Just LOVE I T !!! I was there today for the first time and had 3 tacos. They were amazingly good for a very competitive price."}
{"text":"Julia's is a go to restaurant for my husband and I whenever we want some fresh, authentic tacos, burritos. I have never been disappointed here everything is grilled to perfection. The burgers are amazing the breakfast burritos are fire and the tacos are oh so delicious  I love taco Tuesday all the tacos are $1.50 so good"}
{"text":"We were in town from Kansas City and staying at a hotel close by. My wife and I are crazy over some Mexican food and we were looking for the closest place. Julia's stood out with their \"fast food\" type building and neon paint. When I read that they served \"Mexican and Burgers\", I was skeptical. It's been my experience that when a place serves Mexican food and something else, neither one is stellar. I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, it's Chipotle-style, but this is hardly fast food caliber. For starters, you can see the flames from the open grill and watch the food being grilled fresh. The tortillas are homemade. They have a salsa bar with 6 or 8 types of salsas. We love spicy salsa and most places fall short. Julia's had very hot salsa that had a flavor as good as its \"kick\". We got a burrito and a burrito bowl. The chili verde was wonderful. This stuff was so good and portions so large we took our leftovers to the hotel and had them for lunch the next day. Don't overlook this spot."}
{"text":"UPDATE, June 2015:  Julia's has become an almost weekly stop now, just can't get enough!  One of the most amazing things they do is allow customers to sample the various meat options before deciding.  And this makes it even HARDER to choose!  You'll want them all, and you are simply forced to return to try them all. Super delicious food! ----------------------------- Have eaten @ Julia's 4 or 5 times now, and they never disappoint!! If you're looking for a Mexican restaurant that has FLAVORFUL MEAT, look no further.  Beef,  pork & chicken are mesquite grilled, providing a fabulous aroma that greets you in the parking lot. Chile verde pork & pollo adobado are favorites. Choose how you want to enjoy these meats--in tacos, a burrito, in a salad, or simply as a meat plate with beans & rice.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but they serve it! They also, surprisingly, serve hotdogs & hamburgers,  I guess for your friends who don't like Mexican food but want to hang with you!  Why are you still reading this? Get over there! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  We had the family platter with pork and shredded beef and it was more than enough food for the 4 of us!  The mesquite flavor was amazing! The staff is super friendly and took the time to explain the menu items and options as it was our first time.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had supper there last night.  The restaurant was fairly clean and staff were all friendly and business appeared brisk.  Very nice salsa bar with 5 different sauces to choose from as well as all the pico de gallo you desired, and big dark green peppers (didn't try, they looked very hot).  A bright interior with plenty of tables and lots of room.  The food was tasty and large portions that were belly busters!  The chips were outstanding, I couldn't stop eating them.  We ordered asada quesadillas and an al pastor burrito with added cheese and guacamole.  Their hamburgers looked great, will try next time.  I would give them 3 1/2 stars and would return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Most amazing tacos I've found in Arizona yet!! Also the customer service it better than in most sit down restaurants...if I could give it a 10 star I would."}
{"text":"Always in search for the best tacos when driving around the valley, a Yelp search sent us here. The customer service is awesome! When we walked in we were nicely greeted, we told the guy it was our first time at Julia's. He quickly gave us samples of the pork, steak, and chicken.  We decided on a mixture of them all as they were each very tasty. My favorite was probably the pork, it had a mesquite flavor with a little bit of a kick.  To top it all off they serve fresh homemade watermelon drinks, one of my favorite things ever. I normally have to wait for the State Fair to roll around in order to get my fix.   When back in the area, this will be on our list of places to go back to. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We spotted this on Yelp, and the ratings looked good!  So we stopped for lunch.  They offered us samples, which was cool.  The chicken was fine.  The beef was good.  And the pork was really good!  So my wife got the Monday special (taquitos) and I got hard-shell tacos.  I was immediately concerned when I saw how little meat goes into the tacos.  They literally put in one little scoop.  It should have been two.  It really should have been two.  Then maybe I would have tasted the meat.  As it was, I couldn't taste it at all.  It may as well have not been there.  Very surprising given how flavorful the sample was.  The taquitos were OK.  Nothing special.  Just OK.  I wanted to like this place, but this was just sad.  Note to self:  don't order tacos or taquitos here ever again.    Staff was friendly and solicitous.  I'll give them that.  We may try them one more time, and if we do we'll order the burritos.  If they just put one tiny scoop of meat into those, it will be the last.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  Given all the positive reviews I could be convinced to try once more.  But to say \"I've experienced better\" is an understatement, I'm sorry to say."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time today due to a friend recommending it. It was pretty darn good. I was please to say they were respectful and fast at making our burrito. The burrito was HUGE and my wife and I shared it. It reminds me of El Pollo Loco on the inside but probably better burrito's at a better price. I would definitely recommend swinging by this place and checking them out."}
{"text":"Yelp you let me down on this one.  This joint is like the illegitimate love child of Filibertos and Chipotle.    I judge Mexican joints on their carne asada first.  If you can't do good asada, GTFO!    This was the most pathetic excuse of carne asada I've seen in a long time.  Several chunks were completed inedible - chunks of pure dense fat.  It was luke warm and clearly not fresh.  I had to stop eating my burrito because it was nothing but inedible chunks of fat.    The service was spotty at best.  The dude was friendly to one guy and then barely acknowledged my existence.  Place was not very clean either.    In Az we have a ton of good Mexican joints to check out.  This one should not ever be on that list.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Curt cashier wasn't helpful with our questions. Was in fact a bit condescending. Couldn't be bothered while on his phone. Ordered 3 cheese enchiladas & added beef but instead of inserting, it was dabbled on top w/only a few hard pieces.  Nacho cheese was diluted and chips were stale. Sour cream tasted like it had turned. Uncomfortably warm Inside. Only positive was their fountain drinks were good."}
{"text":"They make the bomb burritos!  They build a burrito in front of you, kind of like Chipotle does.  If you get a burrito with Carne Asada meat, rice, lettuce, salsa it'll run you about $8, but once you start adding cheese, guacamole, pico de galle...that's when you'll end up with a $10 burrito; the tortilla they use is huge and it will feed 2 people I kid you not.   Use another meat choice and the basic burrito runs about $7.  Last couple of times I've been in here, the soda machine was broken - not sure if that's a ploy to get you to buy their expensive bottled drinks.  They also have iced tea and other menu items.  I had carne asada fries and a burrito, even with cutting the burrito in half,  I still had a hard time eating all of that food with 1 other person.  They serve a very generous portion!"}
{"text":"I had the three tacos plate...Carne asada, barbacoa and marinated chicken...Fantastic for six bucks.... Keep.them in business please. They are next to jimmy johns...."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food!! The carne Asada burrito is amazing!  You can taste the smoky flavor from the meat. Also the have really good street tacos."}
{"text":"Great food, it tastes very authentic and fresh! The people who work there are nice and friendly. The prices are decent too. I loved the variety of meat that they had, and the Chipotle-like setup. Atmosphere was okay, but I don't expect anything fancy for fast food. I would definitely recommend this place. Will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food and customer service are wonderful. Forget chipotle, filibertos or taco bell, Julia's top notch food for a great price. I have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome. Just like chipolte but better   6 different marinated meats  Grandma Julia was here.  Working away. Try her own recipe Colorado style beef"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place has become one of my favorites. They use a mesquite grill to cook the food and it provides great flavor to the meat. They also make fresh salsa everyday and offer it at a self serve station. The owner and staff are super friendly and the food comes out fast. The food has never disappointed us whenever we came here and I  highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"First time in and had the Green Chili Burger. Just want to say that it was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of taco/burrito/food options around the newly dubbed \"uptown\" Chandler area, but I have added Julia's to my list of go-to's. The mesquite grill gives off a seriously tasty smell and gets me hungry for just about everything on the menu. I went with a marinated pork (al pastor) burrito. The meat was on point, and they have plenty of options for what else goes in. Only disappointing thing was the onion/cilantro mix ( a must for me with al pastor) was at the salsa bar, so I had to open my already made burrito, to complete it. Real good salsa bar, and the prices are right! Keep up the great work Julia's!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place i will eat 3 times a week at work. The marinated steak is amazing! you will not be disappointed if you decide to go here."}
{"text":"1st time here and i wasn't disappointed. The pozole was really flavorful and hearty, the chilaciles were made with a really tasty salsa that i couldn't get enough of. I want more but can't fit more, lol. The staff is super nice and attentive. I'll be coming back to try the menudo."}
{"text":"I'd give this place more stars if I could!!! Everything about this place is A Amazing. The food is so fresh and that smokey scent when you walk in crawls up your nose and welcomes you back everytime! I eat here at least 3 times a week and never get sick of the steak. The quesadilla is what originally got me hooked. LOOK, if your looking for \" your little spot\" for lunch or what have you, no better spot than here. I have yet to find another place for lunch and if this place keeps up, I never will :) KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!"}
{"text":"This is a great mexican restaurant. The tacos are amazing, the rice and beans are some of the best i have ever had. And the salsa was outstanding. I had the hottest red salsa and it added great flavor to my chicken tacos. I am quite impressed with this food and will return again and bring everyone I know!!  *HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT*"}
{"text":"Wow. Bomb tacos. Salsa bar. I got the four street tacos. Four different kinds: carne asada, chili verde, chicken, pork. All great. Came with chips. I would be a fool not to return."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place!!! I've been coming her since they opened. When I first started coming here it was wonderful!! Think customer service has gone way down."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally tired this place out. The food is very good and fresh. I ordered the 4 soft tacos each with a different meat, carnitas, grilled chicken, barbacoa, and steak.  All of the meats were very flavorful and moist. The steak was my favorite, all charcoaled on the outside and tender on the inside, delicious! My bf had the steak burrito which was also very tasty. Very good fresh homemade tortillas.   It is set up somewhat like Chipotle, where you go down the line and tell them what you want on your order. It is great that they also have a salsa bar. Service is very fast and friendly. Lobby was clean and welcoming. The owner himself was serving the food and was very nice. Great family ran local place to grab a quick bit for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Unexpected find!!  Great food, lots of it, many options!  The smokey steak and chicken are A1, as was the red sauce pork.  Friendly staff, truly wanted your meal to be great!!"}
{"text":"Good place not too Mexican since i wanted to get a torta but they only had burgers. Good service and clean place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Chandler with some of the best carne asada I've ever had.  It was recommended on my first visit and I had it in a quesadilla.  I was very happy that they also serve breakfast tacos all day.  The prices are very reasonable and I would put this food against any restaurant."}
{"text":"AWESOME food everytime we go! Authentic and tasty & great prices! We get the burrito bowl & love it!"}
{"text":"STARVING & NOT HAPPY! I'm giving 3 stars because it's not really the restaurant's fault that I waited over an hr for food that was never going to come. Don't order through the yelp app for delivery because A) they don't deliver and B) there is a huge DISCONNECT with the people/companies involved.  HUGE fail Eat Street, huge fail. What's worse is that it takes 3-5 bus days to get a refund?! Are you kidding me? Please get the information that's available to your customers right. Marketing is only as good as the information given. Let's try and keep that correct. Just a thought.  Especially useful if you don't want 'hangry' customers waiting for food that'll never come!"}
{"text":"First time coming here, after living next door for 2 years. I'm kicking my self because this place is awesome. My family and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I had the chicken taco salad and it was the best I've had.  Fresh ingredients and great taste. He gave me the grilled and the seasoned and I honestly loved them both.   My little one got the last burger (the server told us he gets fresh meat daily and they only had one left).   It was grilled and tasted amazing.  The fries were seasoned to perfection.  Both my husband and my oldest son loved their meal as well.  I would eat here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple times and every time I do it seems to get progressively worse with customer service and quality. Today I ordered my burger and I've been sitting here waiting for over 15 minutes before I decided to go check and of course found out they had forgotten about me. Just sorry and will get it made for you. Not really the best in customer service. Super dirty-floors and tables. I've got something that resembles cheese stuck to my table. Good times"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place based on previous reviews but they seriously fell flat once I tried it. Ordered the signature nachos and three tacos with carne asada. The steak inside the tacos were cold (really cold). The tacos themselves did not have much meat in them at all :(. The nachos were better but still with cold meat sprinkled over it, ruining the taste for me. The taco shells which I thought were fresh, tasted cold and a bit stale.   Overall, would not really recommend this place...really wish Rienda's had not closed down :(."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars for now because i have only tried 2 delicious things on the menu. im coming back as soon as im in the area.  i came here with one other person and they were impressed. i love the salsa. I saved some of the green sauce to take home for my eggs tomorrow morning it was that good."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for the best al pastor. So far, Julia's wins!"}
{"text":"Their bacon burger is awesome! Never tried their Mexican food but the burgers are worth a try. And they have class cokes too. Nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Burritos ALLLLL DAY. Love this place. Sausage, Potato, Eggs and Cheese. 1 Burrito was good for 2 days! I had an addiction for a while"}
{"text":"I thought this place would be nice right up the street from my place. Would not recommend anyone go here. The chicken was dry and so was the service. One worker told me the price is the same regardless of the portion when I asked about a kids quesadilla. So leave your kids home and get ready for poor customer service."}
{"text":"The best place to get tacos imo. The chile verde tacos are out of this world. Quality food for a great price."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The breakfast burros are great! Tacos muy bien!!! It's a family owned business. They are all very nice and you can see Mom in the back cooking the food! Which she does very well! Would recommend this place to everyone, Go try it out! Hopefully they get the drive thru up and working soon, would make it easy to enjoy after long day and feeling lazy!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is extremely good. I've been here for breakfast for almost 2 weeks in a row now. When I see the somebody in the back mixing the sauces from scratch and walking around with a huge crate of eggs - I know this place is fresh! And you can taste it! I get the Egg and Steak breakfast burrito every morning. I've had a couple other burritos and everything I've had is tasty. They are huge burritos. I've never been able to finish one. I actually split the burrito down the middle with a coworker every morning. He pays half, I pay half - that's 2 bucks for an awesome breakfast! ok... the slowness. I feel like it /feels/ slow more than it /is/ slow. Because of style of restaurant this appears to be (order at the counter - rather than a waiter) it can feel real slow because you might be expecting fast food. This is not fast food - this is real food - real good."}
{"text":"I have been finding myself here almost every Taco-Tuesday. I don't know where to start. It's in an odd location off the 87 I think. Because of that reason, I think most people don't know about this gem.  They have $1.50 tacos on Tuesday, and I can't seem to get enough. I'll usually purposely order a lot, that way I don't have to order more in 1 sitting. It never works though. I swear there is something in these tacos that make you get more and more!   Their tacos are street style, so they are small, but they have  massive flavor. Marinated chicken is the best I think. The hardshell tacos are great as well. I haven't tried the burgers, but I hear great things about them.   The staff is great as well, and I think the older lady is Julia:)    if you love tacos or better yet Mexican food...you must try this place asap! It blows most places out the water."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Taco Tuesday is a hit with tacos $1.50/each. Literally, most flavorful meat I think I've had. Fries are great, hamburgers are good but the tacos are to good to go for the hamburger option--in my opinion! Service was great and place is clean."}
{"text":"This isn't like chipotle.  It's way better.  This was my first visit, I had a steak burrito and it was ridiculous.   The meat was perfect.  And thank you for not using iceberg lettuce!!  I'm coming back with friends!!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  We come every Tuesday for taco day.... Can't get enough!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, here it goes with my first review even though I've used Yelp thousands of times to find great restaurants!    Looking for a highly rated Mexican restaurant near my new office I found this gem of a place. I've been dying for *great* Mexican food for a long, long time and haven't found great food since I lived in Issaquah WA and spent three days a week eating at Mi Casa (sadly closed now).   Their stewed beef in a taco tasted exactly like the beer at Mi Casa and was to die for. The green pork chili was incredible. The asada melted in my mouth. And to top it off, the owners were super personable. I'm already dreaming of going back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The owner and cool staff knows customer service.  The mesquite grill provide and amazing taste to the meat.  If you've never been here you have to try it.  The breakfast is great too!"}
{"text":"Seriously great food - the chicken was fabulous!!! This place is legit - gotta try it"}
{"text":"Love Federico (the owner). He was the guy behind the register and was super friendly and excited to help and have us taste test when we told him this was our first time in. I saw one is going into our neighborhood and then we happened to be by their current location and decided to stop in. Super friendly! Loved the food. I got the hamburger cot wasn't anything special but I liked that I could get once since I decided I didn't want Mexican food at the moment. I did pick off my wife's and kids plates and loved everything. We will definitely be back not only for the service and friendliness but for the delicious food as well. Super excited to see you new location!"}
{"text":"So sick I got the chorizo plate with rice and beans and now I feel sick. Never going back..... ugh"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Since I moved to Chandler 4 months ago, Ive been looking for a great Mexican restaurant.  This little Mom & Pop place has Amazing Marinated Meats... I had the Tres Tacos (Chicken, Beef & Pork)... Too die for!  My new favorite Tex Mex!"}
{"text":"The delicious smell of smokey meat overwhelms you as you walk in.  I knew this place would be good when another customer in line could not stop raving about the food.  The staff was very friendly and offered us free samples of their different meats.  The tortillas are made fresh and are the perfect chewy texture.  The portions are big and hearty.  There were 5 of us in my group and everyone said the food was great and they will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Real good Mexican food!!! And their burgers are amazing!!! I forsure recommended this new place!!!"}
{"text":"Their cuatro taco deal is my favorite item, fantastic Asada. Their burritos are also very tasty"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a long time. King of the breakfast burrito Love their El Grande breakfast burrito and all their meats are fresh and cooked great. They have the best nacho cheese (IMO) To make things real exciting, i add it to my burritos on the inside as well as jalepenos. ( extra charge but damn well worth it) ! Service was good. Employees are nice."}
{"text":"Love all the meats in street style tacos!!!!  Everything is so good here including salsas!  Great place for families  too."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to Julia's and it won't be my last.  The flavor of the marinated chicken was delicious.  I had the burrito bowl with black beans and veggies.  The grill have the food a nice flavor and the red sauce had a good kick."}
{"text":"First time I had a good bowl of pozole here in Arizona! My friend had the menudo and it was good too! Highly recommended for a quick hang over fix lol"}
{"text":"ohhh spicy and messy just how i love my burgers cant wait to go back again"}
{"text":"4 stars   Yummy food   nice staff       would have been 5 stars but could not find a clean table to sit at.  Its the small stuff that are killers"}
{"text":"I saw this place driving by to work and checked out the reviews/photos and decided to give it a try. I ordered the flame - broiled bacon guacamole (my fave burger from Carl's jr.) and dam it was bomb. I am not comparing it to Carl's  jr. but this burger was really good. u can taste the mesquite which I like, and was a bit messy. but what is a good burger without the mess? I will Def go back to try other items. I think they also offer samples of what they are cooking since I over heard them offering  to a customer."}
{"text":"The smell of mesquite wood permeates the air as you enter this small little shop. The menu is pretty basic and as advertised on their name: Mexican food and burgers. Their grill setup looks nice, as well as their toppings area.   I went with the Mexican style breakfast burrito with egg. It was a hefty burrito filled with potatoes, cheese, pico de gallo, and egg. Although there was no meat in the burrito, the ingredients went well with each other so well I didn't miss the meat at all. I especially loved the soft fluffy scrambled egg.   The salsa bar to the side had an extensive variety of salsas, roasted jalapeño, and pickled onions. As for drinks, they have aquas frescas, and while they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine it wasn't working when we were here so sodas were by the bottle.  It only took a few minutes for our order to be made and the burrito itself was gigantic, nearly the size of my forearm! I could only finish a little more than half of my burrito but it made for tasty leftovers the next day.  One thing to note is that you will most likely smell like BBQ mesquite when you leave the restaurant so you know to plan accordingly.  I'll be back to try a tasty mesquite grilled burger next time!"}
{"text":"The mesquite smell as soon as you enter is so enticing! I loved my carne asada quesadilla and the salsa bar had so many options. I love that you can choose between canned US Fanta or bottled real sugar Fanta... Nice touch. :-) It was not very busy, but the weather was pretty bad, so hopefully that was the reason and this little local joint gets enough business to stick around."}
{"text":"My daughters and I ate here today, the food was great.  We both got the Tres Hard Tacos, which was $5.99 each. My daughter got 2 barbacoa and one carne asada taco. She loved the barbacoa. I had one each of marinated chicken, marinated pork and carne asada. The 2 marinated meats were excellent... You could tell that they were marinated in citrus or something sweet like pineapple. The carne asada was pretty good, and had the grilled mesquite flavor.  The hard shelled tacos were regular size, not street tacos.  There is a nice salsa bar, with about 5 or 6 different salsas.  My only complaint would be the menu board, it is extremely difficult to read.. Either it was not lit up or items were so small they were illegible."}
{"text":"Delicious made to order Mexican and American food. Get an giant burrito or an amazing burger. Whatever you order, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First off a place that has homemade salsas that are fabulous! Tacos are great. But I think the green chili burger is one of the best in the state! Dip the fries in the chipolte salsa add a Mexican Coke and call me one happy mofo!  Did I tell you how nice the whole crew is?"}
{"text":"So good! We tried it on Taco Tuesday when tacos are only $1.50. They're street taco sized. There are 7 different meats to choose from and the incredibly nice & helpful employee offered us tastes of any we wanted. I got green chili pork, carne asada, and marinated chicken. All were good but the chicken was my favorite. My husband tried all 7 and liked all of them with his favorite being the marinated pork.  They will dress the tacos however you want at the counter with lettuce, cheese, pico, salsas, etc. or there is also a salsa bar by the soda machine where you can dress them yourselves. I recommend both green salsas! There was a red one that was crazy hot too if thats something you're into. I'm too wimpy for it.  They also have breakfast tacos/burritos/bowls that I want to come back and try. Breakfast tacos are only 99 cents before 11am! I'm pretty interested to try the burgers as well. The mesquite smells so good! They have some sort of special on Wednesdays for the burgers. Not sure on the details of the special but its on my list to try!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try a few days ago and I gotta' say, WOW.Upon entering,I was greeted by the manager and an associate immediately.I was having a hard time deciding what to order for dinner so the manager gave me samples of all the meats.Their chile rojo is one of the best I have ever had.Reminded me of my mom's cooking as a kid.I loved it.I ordered the 4 tacos for $5.99 and decided to get two of em' with the chili rojo and the other two with chicken.Their chicken was truly one of a kind.My gf ordered a burrito for $5.99 and it was so huge and tasted soo good too.I am definitely goin' back there soon.The service and food was great.A++"}
{"text":"Seriously SO good! I wish I could give 10 stars! From spicy chicken hard shell tacos to salsa verde burrito bowl and carnitas burrito everything was so full of flavor!"}
{"text":"We have passed by this restaurant a few times and never stopped. We finally stopped in and we were greeted by the son of the owner. He was great! Very knowledgeable and very friendly. He gave us samples of everything to try. The food was great! The service was amazing! I recommend them to anyone who wants great Mexican food! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been all over the valley for tacos and this is the only place I know that cooks over mesquite wood (not charcoal). You can taste the difference and we will be back for more"}
{"text":"The smell of mesquite greets you upon entry. All the food is great. Highly recommend the $0.99 breakfast tacos, especially the chorizo.   Amazing salsa bar with about 10 selections.  Heard their burgers are great but haven't tried them...yet."}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican food. The owner is very nice and genuine in his dealings with customers. He shakes my hand every time I go in and remembers me as though I eat there everyday (I do not). The portions are very large and everything is delicious. It is great to see a hardworking person make his dream a success. I love everything from the breakfast tacos and burritos, to the burgers, to the taco salad. It is all very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended to me. I actually was pretty disappointed. The person that served me was not very knowledgeable and new to the company. The server was quite slow. I had the street tacos for $6.99. When I got to the register there was a $.40 charge for using my debit card. My total came out to $8.21. I was a little disappointed by that. They served me chips with my street tacos. When I ate the chips they were stale tasting, cold, not warm. They did not have much of a choice of salsa for chips on the salsa bar. Only just very mild salsa to medium and hot salsa but not something that you would want to have with chips per se. The atmosphere is not that great, you have Spanish music playing over the radio, and you have a bunch of TVs on different channels quietly producing sound. This restaurant is supposed to be a Mexican food restaurant but they serve burgers here so it looks like they're trying to combine burger making with Mexican food making and I think that's a problem for them. I think they should focus on one or the other. The other thing that bothered me was everything was pre-cooked except for my corn tortillas which didn't have enough oil on them and were dry when they served them to me as street tacos. I was recently at another Mexican food restaurant and it was bustling with people coming and going and lots of people eating food there. Here there's not a lot of that going on, a few people coming in but not a whole lot of traffic so that speaks volumes about their business at the height of the dinner hour."}
{"text":"We've driven by this place plenty of times and paid it no mind. It just seemed odd that they boast both great Mexican food and  good burgers and hot dogs, but we are definitely glad we stopped in today. As for the burgers and dogs, I can't really say because we were on the hunt for Mexican food. This place hit the spot! They might sell both types of cuisine but they definitely specialize in Mexican.   First, they offer samples of everything which is really convenient. We tried the pollo adobado, pork adobado, carne asada, and barbacoa. They were all delicious. We settled on the carne asada burritos enichlada style. The green sauce is spicy but has a great citrus and tamatillo flavor. The red sauce is mild and has a more traditional red chili flavor. The food was delicious, filling, and definitely tasted fresh.   we also tried the menudo but it lacked the \"bovine\" flavor of a well-made authentic menudo. The flavor was flat and kid of watery, pretty boring.   All in all, we left satisfied and with plans for a future visit. I would definitely recommend this place. If nothing else, the burritos were cheaper, bigger, and tastier than Chipotle or Qdoba.  As a side note, the restaurant also offers a traditional side bar."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover.. This place is amazing!!! I have been back multiple times and haven't been disappointed. Tacos, burritos and burgers are all outstanding."}
{"text":"Oooh man where do I start!   For starters lets talk about the great customer service. I thought they had closed for the evening so I got back into my car and I noticed the guy who was cleaning around the restaurant come out to let me know they were still opened and to come on in. He could have simply just let me leave but he didn't and I really appreciated that. He was very friendly, we had a small conversation going. Any who while we were chatting it up I told him it was my first time here and that I used to come by when it was a burger spot little did I know they are the same owners! I loved their burgers and I'm glad I can still get them! I digress he also gave me samples of the different meats such as the chicken, pork, red and green chile, the barbacoa. I thought that was so kind of him. The meats are delicious and some tasted just like how my Abuelita makes it so it's a win for me!   I also like the fact that they serve menudo and posole on the weekends. Most Mexican restaurants only have menudo.   I will definitely be back with my mom and grandparents.  Let me stop typing and get back to my delicious carne asada burrito!   Let's support local businesses!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All seven meats are amazing. This ain't your regular whatever-a-bertos."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The food is awesome here!!! I got a chicken burrito and it was super well sized,  fresh ingredients and sooo good. If you come on Friday or Saturday they have Menudo and Posole. I LOVED THE POSOLE!! Great salsa bar with good salsa variety. Also the people working here are efficient, fast and super friendly!!   MAKE SURE: Fridays and Saturdays they have menudo and pozole. Both are amazing!!"}
{"text":"First off I'll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this place as it is about a mile from my home. I usually stick to my local favorites but have scoped this place out while driving by and got a coupon in the mailer.  First things first when you first walk in the smell of the mesquite is a nice welcome, unfortunately it pretty much ends there.   There were 4 gentlemen ordering in front of me and basically 2 hard working workers taking care of the restaurant. Both were trying to make burritos near where you order while also cooking in the back as well as run the cash register. These guys were moving as fast as they could but were very disorganized (obviously a management issue). By the time I got to order I had been standing in line for over 10 minutes. While standing in line which seemed forever I noticed a few things. First the tortillas are store bought. The cooks literally opened up a shopping bag on the counter and pulled out clearly labeled for retail bags of tortillas (the bags had the government mandated nutritional info printed on them). After reading reviews of this place I noticed a few other Yelpers noticed this as well. I know that the majority of the \"Bertos\" Mexican places use locally made tortillas. So seeing this when I got to order I changed my order to breakfast Tacos (was originally going for a burrito) and hoped for the best. Also when waiting I noticed that the carne asada was nearly black on the outside (think jerkey) not juicy steak like you get at every run of the mill \"Bertos\". I also noticed that one of the cooks had a towel thrown over his shoulder and would use it to wipe down everything from the counter when food spilled on it to the prep areas where he would put down tortillas when someone ordered one. After working in a kitchen I know this is a no no per health code violations.   My coupon was buy any 2 breakfast items and a drink and get one item free. So this is were it gets bad fast. While ordering the cook says what are you in the mood for and  I said Im looking at the tacos which do you suggest and he says back the chorizo ones. He then tells me that they are all 99 cents during breakfast hours. So at the register now stands what I guess was the manager as he was wearing a Julias Mesquite Mexican Grill Polo and was pulling large sums of money in and out of the register. I handed him my coupon thinking 2 breakfast tacos at 99 cents plus a buck and a half for a drink (they didnt have any listed prices for any of the drinks they have) so I thought with tax Im walking out for less than $4 bucks. The manager then says this coupon is for the breakfast platters which I then look at the coupon and nope it says any 2 breakfast items. So he hastily rings me up and says my total was $6 and some change. So I tried to break down the simple math for him and said 2 tacos at 99 cents each plus the drink which he automatically charged me for a large is $4 bucks plus tax. He then tried to explain to me that the tacos are originally $1.89. I may not be have a math degree from Harvard but simple math is simple math. I asked him are the breakfast tacos 99 cents during breakfast and he said yes. They was a gentleman waiting behind me to pay and his food was ready so I just paid my tab. While waiting again (for my food) I was looking at the receipt and what he did was charge me for 2 full price tacos, not the breakfast pricing. I told the manager that he had over charged me which then continued to argue with me. So I asked him to see the coupon which I checked to see if it said anything that you had to pay the full menu price while ordering which it didnt. I know it was only a few bucks but I work hard for my money and just dont like giving it away and being over charged. I told the manager that I was going to write a review on Yelp which he responded that nobody reads those things.   So I finally get my breakfast tacos which had left a lot to be desired. They were very sloppy and greasy. I have eatin at almost every \"Bertos\" place in the valley and I know greasy lol but these were dripping with grease and coated my throat with a film. I only ate one which I braved though because I wanted to try the different kinds of salsa. Honestly if I didnt have an issue with the math in this place I would still not come back. With the store bought tortillas, the dried up meat (other Yelpers have said the same) and the cooks not being properly trained in the health codes, on top of it taking 20 plus minutes for me to order and receive 3 small breakfast tacos when there were only 4 people in front of me. There are plenty of other Mexican joints and your money and time are better spent else where. I know almost everyone rags on the \"Bertos\" places but my local one is fine dinning compared to this place."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I'm very suspicious that I'm going to get a store bought tortilla when eating Mexican food in Arizona. I had a feeling the carnivore type tacos would have an awesome mesquite flavor but I didn't get to try it this time around.  It doesn't have a drive thru but it's a real simple to order take out or eat in. My hunt was for a breakfast burrito still served anytime of the day. I ordered a burrito with eggs,ham,potatoes, beans, and cheese. The smell of the wonderful mesquite makes me want to come back for a burger or taco which I well. Anyhow, I got my salsa at the salsa bar while waiting and I receive my to go order shortly after. I left and in the car open the burrito and to my surprise a homemade tortilla with fresh ingredients still at 11:30am. The reason from my 5 is the homemade tortillas with all the goodness inside."}
{"text":"I love their hard shell carne asada tacos. Everything is so fresh& tasty. The employees are very nice as well. The food is very inexpensive. I work nearby so I try to come here when I can. They should open another location in Phoenix. I think it would do very well as there would not be much competition because their food is so amazing."}
{"text":"Food is great,  prices good.  But the place is full of flies and the most obnoxious music I've heard.  Get it take out or take your chances."}
{"text":"It's not the store bought tortillas, or the occasional crying child that keeps people going back to this place. It's that sweet, \"holy s**t\" revelation you get when you bite into anything Julia's has grilled over that mesquite grill. The smell from the parking lot?!?!?! It lures you in. And when you take that first bite.....you know damn well this ain't no regular taco joint. There's a few  that whine about children, and maybe even the occasional loud television, but the truth is, those are a form of mindless entertainment, while you patiently await your turn to sample some of the absolutely BEST Mexican food in the East Valley! But, once you settle in, unwrap that wonderful piece of artwork before you, and take a bite.......everything around you ceases to matter! Those exceptional flavors upon your palate can never be emulated at any Filla...whatevers,  or Taco nastiness. Don't believe me? Try it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Seriously! I have to add some words but the first two are all you need. Have eaten many a burrito but had the zen burrito tonight. The pork has got some heat. I had a 1/2 and 1/2 toss in some more heat and other wants, pull up a chair and get your elbows planted."}
{"text":"Food is great. Carne asada was delicious and it's very hard for me to approve carne asada as i am used to authentic Mexican food. I did find it be a little pricey compared to other places."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place the service was awesome and the food a big 'OL 2 thumbs up the Carne asada was great. Assembly line kinda like Chipotle but way better. I will definitely be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican food I have ever had. They are quite flexible if you need something more or less in your tacos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town... Filibertos has met it's match.....  The breakfast burritos were so delicious. Everything is made fresh daily.. super fresh everything is prepared on site and all the tacos shells are made fresh on site too. The tortillas are definitely my favorite ... This place is a hidden gem in Chandler Gilbert area.. if you get a chance to stop as I have told myself I need to stop as I normally pass this place on my way to visit my mom's and I can day I stopped this morning and in am so happy I did.. . You will be blown away with the flavor everything is excellent, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Howdy Az Foodies  Don't you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?  That's how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?  This piqued my interest.... it's kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...  I go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..  It started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.  A nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!  The beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?  After standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl... \" I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave\"  I said Thank You and left.  To be fair I know they opened not too long ago, so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...  Not sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.  Good luck to you Julia's....  And to the rest of you......  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"We were staying in Gilbert for a week and decided to try this place.  We ordered two taco salads, a chili burger and an enchilada special.  All the food was good.  The service was nice and quick."}
{"text":"Place is bomb,  from there breakfast burritos to their carne asada burros.  Staff was friendly and even let us sample to decide on what we want. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Over the past couple months, the food has steadily declined in quality. I don't know what changed, but lately I'm finding more and more inedible pieces of meat in my tacos. The pico de gallo isn't shown much love any more, and is very bland. Lastly, the beans are held for far too long; I keep getting burnt refried beans that leave an awful taste in my mouth. I'll have to get my taco Tuesday fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'd give the food 3.5 stars, slightly above average, food is more authentic than Pollo Loco, no microwaving tortillas here. Beans and rice are fresh tasting. I tried using an entertainment coupon which she accepted although I had to buy 2 drinks which was $4.50. So I saved about $1.50 because I normally don't order drinks."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and friendly. I was offered samples of the meat I ordered a Chile verde burrito with selected top selection. pings like you would get from Chipotle, but more meat selections to chose from. The tortilla chips are free and they have a good salsa bar"}
{"text":"Went there today for taco Tuesday. Street tacos for $1.50 each. You can choose between 7 different meats. I had 3, marinated chicken, asada, green chile pork. I enjoyed all 3. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will return."}
{"text":"huge shout out to Chris for introducing me to the place. he let me try the different meats and was really kind the entire visit. and the burrito was too bomb!"}
{"text":"Burgers and mexican food. Six meat choices plus vegetarian. Beans, rice, potatoes, french fries, peppers, guac, corn, whatever they got it and it isn't extra. Daily specials to eat cheap. Prep work going on by the mesquite grill causes drooling. Place smells AMAZING due to the mesquite.   The guy before me had the most complex questions and requests for his two burritos and they didn't even blink.  It's set up like a tacqueria and you get whatever you want in your burrito, taco, nachos etc.  Breakfsst burrito at 5pm?  No problem.  Today we had 10 tacos and drinks and with tax it was just under $20.  We had baracoa, marinated pork, marinated chicken, and chili verde tacos.  On the tacos, we had them throw on cheese, salsa, pico, grilled corn, guac, lettuce, and some cream cheese on different tacos.  The guy before me wanted a breakfast burrito with 3 different meats and then a 4 meat burrito with french fries and beans and both of them were THE SIZE OF MY HEAD!  The guy after me ordered steak, pork, chicken and bacon on his burrito.  F yeah!"}
{"text":"I found this place today by accident, but it was a lucky find. I had the street tacos with asada. They are fantastic. The red salsa they keep behind the counter has a real kick to it, so be careful if you can't handle spicy food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is super accommodating.  I've been there a handful of times. Food is amazing. The carne asada is delicious and seasoned perfect. I love the barbacoa, it's tender and delish. Pricing is good, salsa bar is fresh, and kitchen it's clean. This is one of those consistent places that you'll get good food at."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day with the hubby (as usual ). The line was so long but it moved quickly. Found this place on Yelp and it does not disappoint. I tried the cheeseburger and fries and hubby got the four taco plate so we could try each others food. Hey, it says tacos AND burgers :-). My burger was very very good and the tacos were excellent.  We tried chicken and asada. Asada rocked. The burritos that they were making looked so good and huge! Oh and the ice tea is  good as well. Will definitely be back for great food at great prices."}
{"text":"Man... This place is gooood. When we walked in and mentioned that we were new the super friendly server offered us samples of their meat and they were all amazing. Husband opted for a ginormous burrito, I went with Quatro Tacos and a melon agua Fresca. You could taste the mesquite smoke and all of the toppings were totally on point. Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I mean it's definitely interesting. It's like a polibertos meets jack in the box. Reasonably priced but for the amount of food. I got the two entree plate with extra chicken. Which was pretty good. The rice and beans were a bit tasteless. Quick easy stop but nothing too wow about it for me to return."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting place, build your own burrito with a variety of delicious meats.   Worth giving a try, very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast burritos but everything else kinda left us flat.  The Carne Asada is good but the burritos are so full of rice, potatoes, beans etc that you won't hardly taste it.  For a $7 burrito they should be looking way more like Filibertos.   I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"amazing food and amazing service! the woman that helped us was incredibly nice and the food was so good!!"}
{"text":"Excellent spicy marinated chicken. There's something here for everyone,  including mesquite grilled burgers and chili verde. My daughter enjoyed the nicely sized burrito. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here a little bit before closing because we were reallyyy craving some Mexican and saw it had great reviews and it really did not disappoint! My boyfriend got a burrito bigger than him and I got myself a pretty large burrito all for less then $20! The flavors were to die for and I couldn't even finish my meal it was so much food. Will definitely think of this place before Chipotle next time for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. It's not something that you drive by and notice or are awed by as the building and location is very subdued but it's worth visiting. Also, you're not walking into a zagat rated or Michelin star establishment but that doesn't deter from the food. It's a more rustic feel with the open flamed grill that uses mesquite wood for the flame. They make burritos, tacos, burgers, and more. The two times I have been here I opted for Mexican food because I have a penchant for that style of cooking plus I think the meat goes well inside a tortilla. I prefer the carne asada and the chicken, but the chili verde and pastor also have some good flavor - if you have ever had mesquite cooked meat you know what I'm talking about. It's a fast food style place with the meat already cooked and staged in plastic bins, along with the toppings but it's warm, fresh, and full of taste. They have a salsa bar with some good offerings - a few red and a few green; most of which are spicy. They do desserts too, but I have not had those yet. It's worth a try if nothing else."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I can't believe I haven't eaten here before!!!  I got a breakfast burrito!! Perfection!  Super good tortilla!  Homemade salsa, spicy and amazing! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"After our disaster at Chase's Diner (see review) we stopped in here to get breakfast.  Looks like they have not been open long but it was clean and adequately staffed, no line so are orders got in quickly.  The manager was running the cash register and was very polite and attentive.  Had the Chorizo breakfast burrito, it was large as burritos go,  hot, fresh and yummy!  Definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"We ordered 9 tacos and got them with hard shells. Honestly I can't say we would ever order them again. For starters 3 of our tacos had far less than what anybody would call the proper amount of chicken, and the shells taste awfully close to being stale. We might give this place another chance because I will say the guacamole was delicious and the staff was very friendly, we just won't get the hard shell tacos."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite spots. The carne asada quesadillas are our favorites! The guacamole and salsa bar are an added plus."}
{"text":"Terrible. We ordered a shredded beef burrito. My husband is a man and he likes more meat than what you would give a 2 year old. And my burrito bowl same thing. They charge 16$ for the two and hardly any meat. Hardly any food. Very stingy and expensive"}
{"text":"My biggest ragret was forgetting to grab some salsa from the salsa bar!!!! NOOOOOOOO! The burritos were still way tasty even without the salsa though, a testament to the legendariness. I got a carne asada and bacon burrito, and my boyfriend got a chorizo one. Both were super delicious. We were famished after our 4 hour flight from Cincinnati, and he was stuffed after his and I couldn't finish mine. They're gigantic, with the right ratio of ingredients. I've come for Taco Tuesdays before and remember them being pretty tasty as well (although it was probably a year or so ago so I can't quite remember as delicious tacos are rampant in Arizona)  The man at the register was super nice to us, and chatted with us. If you want dessert though, they don't have it until closer to lunchtime. Next time, choco flan, next time."}
{"text":"Our first time here...read the reviews on Yelp... Decided to take a shot...Nice lady at counter gave us wonderful samples....and we so enjoyed the soft tacos and fresh watermelon drink... Food was great, restaurant was clean, great prices! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a good option if you want Mexican food and a casual dining experience. Not as good as Chipotle but way more options!! The Tacos and enchiladas were the best. The nachos not so much. It was clean and a good atmosphere for my 2 year old son. I'll probably only come back for the 1.50 taco Tuesday special but that's okay with me!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Thursday to celebrate National Nacho Day after seeing Marc M.'s post and what a treat!  I had originally planned on going to another place down the street but I had Julia's bookmarked for a while so why not try something new?  Situated in what was once a Target's parking lot, this small and unassuming restaurant was quite an adventure.  Upon walking in, there's a distinct smell of mesquite.  Whether it's artificial or just for show, who cares?  It smells great.  There's a generous bar of all sorts of grilled meats, fixings, and salsa.  The menu is kind of confusing but I already had made myself a note before to try their soft tacos.  The best day to get tacos are Tuesdays, mind you, when they're $1.50 each.  Mr. W. had the Crazy Thursday special which is a green-sauced enchilada if I remember right and we also had nachos.   At first I wasn't sure what to expect.  The lovely lady had made the enchiladas first.  First warming up the tortillas and then filling it with cheese before sprinkling more cheese on top only to be be put into the microwave.  That had us exchanging a side-glance at each other.  But when I saw her making my little street tacos and stuffing it full of marinated chicken and topping it with pico de gallo and other stuff, I had forgiven her for the microwave business. Then she had started pouring ladles full of cheez whiz onto the nachos.  I just wanted to tuck in.  Our meal was $23 for the both of us so my wallet was happy.  So how did everything taste?  Delicious!  The carne asada on the nachos and my marinate chicken in the tacos were both delicious, flavorful, and moist.  The portions are decent for the price and the salsa bar was a mini adventure on its own.  I wanted to try them all but I was scared and unsure on which ones were mild and which ones were a blazing inferno.  I wish there were little signs.  Oh well.    Nonetheless, Julia's served up a decent dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again.  I think I want to try a burrito or a taco salad next time!"}
{"text":"Bought tacos and a burrito. Ordered 3 types of meat and they were all served cold. Flavors were not that great."}
{"text":"Ummmmm think I picked the wrong thing... still willing to try again and see but.... that marinated chicken was marinated with a spice I don't dig and it sticks with ya all day I picked burrito style and ended up picking at it. The marinated chicken is strong and takes over the whole burrito! Nice choice in salsas and a couple with a good kick! But think I would stick to steak or something else as long as that spice is on everything?! Guess when I saw mesquite I was hoping for that yummy grilled flavor with that pollo asada marinade but that wasn't the case. I'll upgrade the review once I try something else but for now I'm trying to get that taste out the back of my throat:/"}
{"text":"Co worker and i were in the area and after seeing all the reviews we had to stop by. This place is like a expensive version of chipotle. I ordered a burrito barbacoa and it was totally soggy and gross. This was another place that charges you so much but fills their food with beans and rice and sprinkles meat in it, Barbacoa also tasted like it was dumped in salt. Sucks because i wanted to like it. Looks like it was family owned."}
{"text":"Walked in the door to this much anticipated yelp recommendation and guy behind the counter is abounding with energy to take our order - ah he says - your 1st time here - let me get you some samples - laid out the food choices and then made recommendations - up sold on a couple desserts that were amazing vanilla and chocolate flan - Carne Asada  platter could have fed a family of 2-3 - very tasty and good quality food + salsa bar - excellent chicken taco salad - 2 large waters 20 bucks - ate all the steak and maybe 1/2 the rice and beans - Mexican TV stations with sound - looks like a large hamburger diner inside - oh yeah they serve hamburgers and breakfast and Tuesday is,1.50 taco day - can't remember the guys name but said he had been there 5 months can't miss him he's worth 1/2 the price of admission"}
{"text":"Quite good.  They'll give you a sample of their meats.  All are good...maybe even great in some cases.  Real nice salsa bar with lots of choices.  We had carne asada burrito and carne asada tacos.  Burrito was huuuuuggggggeeeee...and good.  For whatever reason we ordered the tacos in hard shells.  They weren't bad, but I would go with soft shell in the future."}
{"text":"I had a burrito enchilada style and it was huge and amazing. I'll definitely be coming back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Had the menudo for lunch on Friday, immediately regretted that decision on my way back to work. It messed up my stomach so bad. Today (A full 24 hours later) my stomach still messed up. Also the menudo was bland and greasy."}
