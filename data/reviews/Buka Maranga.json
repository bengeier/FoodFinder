{"text":"Fresh bagels, roll up windows, quiet summer vibe. What's not to like! I got the sesame bagel with half veggie spread and half sundried tomato spread. While both tasted good, I will go for the veggie spread next time as it was more flavorful."}
{"text":"Very good nice and quiet...   Food was delish...low grease great coffee   More a cafeteria feel though not a full service restaurant"}
{"text":"Freshly baked bagels. Very good selextion of spreads, soups and sides. Good spot for a quick lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"Bought 12 bagels, 6 muffins, 3 tubs of cream cheese, and a carafe of coffee for business meeting. Very expensive $73.  Quality of food was excellent."}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted a quick breakfast and something not too heavy like our usual go-to's ! We've always passed by this place and always wanted to try it so we finally did! It's a very simple breakfast place, lots of food that could be made at home but it's nice for someone else to do it once in a while! Bagels were made fresh which really makes a difference in the taste and quality of the entire sandwich! The soups were good but seems like something that was packed frozen.  It's a cute, small and cozy restaurant that also sells small items such as some christmas decor (during the holidays of course) and snacks to go. The owners were very welcoming and super friendly! I'd like to come back again to try more menu items and even buy some bagels to enjoy at home!"}
{"text":"5/5 amazing.  I have driven by this place for years and finally went in for breakfast today and I loved it so much. for 6$ I got a coffee and a fresh bagel breakfast sandwich. This is my new favourite for an on the go breakfast.   Highly recommend !!   They have so many different fresh bagel options and 3 different types of coffees and lattes and cappuccinos!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Good value. Scratch made, quick service. Can't ask for more.  Food is fresh and delicious.  Great atmosphere.  Great vibes."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side,  but it's nice to choose your own bread and pick from the menu anything from breakfast to lunch.   Sandwiches mostly.  It was okay  nothing special.    Latte was alright.    Atmosphere is nice, decorated in a bistro setting.  Would've been nice to sit if I had the time."}
{"text":"Ordered the California salad with salmon, expected the price to be higher with the added salmon, totalled $19. Once I received the salad, it was less than half the carry-out box..less than half the box for $19.. will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a quick breakfast on my way to work from a Dr's appointment, but I didn't want fast food. Decided to try Bukamaranga. Ordered a bacon and cheddar egg scrambler and it was pretty good! Had the choice to choose my own bagel and everything was made fresh to order. For $4.99 it was a good breakfast sandwich but a lot healthier and less greasy then a fast food place. Decor is cute. The person who made my bagel gave food service but the lady at the cash, not so much.  Would go back and try their bagels on their own"}
{"text":"Great location with plenty of seating, good service, and roll up doors for the summer. Freshly made bagels you choose at the counter.  For coffee they give you a cup at the counter and you fill it yourself from multiple options at the milk/sugar counter. The coffee was hot and full of flavor.  They also make your typical late type of drinks and plenty of made to order food options. Great for breakfast, lunch or coffee.  I had a pumpernickel bagel with a spinach and mushroom omelet. My daughter had a cinnamon bagel with ham and cheese.  My wife had The Works bagel with a Vegetarian omelet (onion, tomatoes, and peppers). We all loved our meals!"}
{"text":"I haven't had this kind of fabulous service in a long time. The owners are the kindest people you will meet. The food was very good, and the staff accommodated all our particular requests. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Truly impressed with the service!"}
{"text":"Went to this premise, which recently had a makeover. The bagels here are incredibly good! I also enjoy their coffee and believe in supporting local business. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our business morning lunch was catered by them and they delivered the goods literally.  Freshly baked croissants, bagels, and pastries that were really delicious.  You can tell these were made by hand and not from a box.    I'm looking forward to coming here for lunch.  It's a great spot to grab your lunch... as it's a bright sunny environment and service here is personable.  The owners, Tina, was on hand to take care of everything and she was great.  My previous experience with the bagel and coffees lead me to breakfast and hopefully now to their lunches!  I highly recommend trying this place out as it's a local business that has a great tasting product with equally great service.  Please read my previous review that just confirms my experiences two times over!"}
{"text":"Came here for to try out the bagels and breakfast. Breakfast bagel menu is small yet concise. (How many options do people truly need for a breakfast bagel anyways?) Bagels were nice and dense but not tough. Sandwiches were constructed with care and served quickly despite the staff being very busy with lunch catering orders. Hot drink menu was above just above average quality for average price. It was a bit of a surprise that the coffee \"refill\" was the same price as an origin purchase.  Restaurant was tidy and the staff kept busy with keeping the prep bar well stocked and clean. Service was attentive enough. It was odd that they didn't have a clear, designated spot for customers to bus their tables to. Seemed that customers were placing their dirty dishes anywhere from the front cash counter to the prep bar to the catering staging table.  Overall, a well run mom and pop shop with well selected staff. Would definitely return to try more items off their menu and also for breakfast again."}
