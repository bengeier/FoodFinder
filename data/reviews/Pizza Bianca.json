{"text":"I used to hate pizza. Then I found this place. This is my personal favorite pizza place. It's so cheesy and the crust is perfect. My family has always been friends with this family and they told me to try their pizza and now I love it. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, but the appetizers and hoagies are pretty good.  The prices are decent for the quality of food they serve.  We tried to do delivery one night but it was well over an hour wait on a weeknight so we ended up picking it up in 15 minutes instead.  I order from here occasionally since it is really close to my house, but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"First and last time customer tonight.  If I could have put no stars it would be too good.  I was the only customer at 5:30 pm.  After placing my order the man that waited on me started hollering at an older female employee.  Telling her to stop the f in shit.  He continued using vulgar language to this women.  Screaming at the top of his lungs. Said he is the manager and she needs to do as he says.  As if this wasn't bad enough he then proceeds say mom you have to listen to me.  Wow what an ass.  Using this language toward his mother while customers are in the store.  I wanted to go behind the counter and kick the shit out of him myself.  Well before I left he was hiding somewhere but I left him a note and told him what I thought of him.  Ok enough said about that loser.  As far as the pizza goes that might explain at 5:30 pm which he said was there dinner rush and I was the only customer.  Really glad the pizza was bad. Makes it easier not to go back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but was quite surprised to pick up our food to find out it was 15 bucks more than expected.  Don't use the online menu.  It is a few years outdated.  Prices have increased!"}
{"text":"I work at a local doctor office and we called to place an order for lunch and I was screamed at by a worker there because we had 3 orders. Very small orders, only one item each but had to have the seperate. She said they do not want our business if we can't combine the orders into one and it was absolutley ridiculous that we called in with 3 seperate orders. Well they will never get our business again or anyone at our offices or our families. She was so rude and uncalled for."}
{"text":"Pierogi Pizza and the Taco Pizza = Goooooood!  PROS: Delivery local shop (White Oak) Consistent If you go into the shop, it appears to be clean  CONS: No dine-in available; Take-out or delivery only   Located in Oak Park Shopping Center Parking is a shared lot for the shopping center"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Prices are not great. I called before the time posted (by ten minutes) on when they quit delivering (not close). I was told they are not delivering anymore that night. Well good then cause pizza hut got my $(it spends anywhere)"}
{"text":"After my family has gone through every pizza place around, this is the one place we always come back to. It's best to order for pick-up here because it is just a small store front located in Oak Park Mall. The pizza is delicious. I'm not one to normally crave pizza, but I find myself in the mood for the their pizza often. Also, they sell half gallon cartons of Turner's Tea (who doesn't love that?). Try their supreme hoagie. My very picky father goes back again and again for that hoagie!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering all summer from here and love it.  The people that work here are always friendly.  Wish I would have tried it sooner.  The food is always fresh, just ordered soup, pizza, and hoagie.  Yummy"}
