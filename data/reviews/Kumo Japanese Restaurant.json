{"text":"You know there is a problem when you sit down wanting to grab a quick lunch special, and they tell you it's not available on Sunday even though there is no restrictions on the menu.  Service is great I have to give them that.  Food is mediocre at best. Fresh maybe but that's about it. The food doesn't live up to the standards set by their price.  I honestly don't know why they have four stars rating... I would happily drive down the street to Sherway Gardens and eat some mall sushi same quality much faster and not feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review down to 3 stars. As of Dec 2014 - the size of the sashimi is now more regular size and we've branched out to their kitchen offerings. The vegetarian soup soba was disappointing with the noodles more like instant noodles and just a scant few pieces of sprouts and maybe carrots. The beef dish seemed to contain microwaved meat that was too tough to chew. To their credit their service was still fabulous and the beef dish was quickly replaced with a salmon dish. They also continued to serve a free appetizer and free dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food wasn't bad either but not the best, I have been to better Japanese restaurants. We order fried basil shrimp for appetizer, I found it alright but my friend loved it. For rolls we ordered a spider crab roll which was delicious, loved it! And a lobster roll...it's not bad but just find the taste a bit unique and strange. Also got an appetizer and a dessert on the house which is always a bonus. Bill came up to $40 for 2 with tax and this included. Give this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Oh Urbanspoon! Why are you so misleading. This place had 87% on urbanspoon, and in fact 4/5 on Yelp. After seeing the stellar ratings, the little sushi monster inside of me awoke.  And here we are...  Overall, the food quality was OK--nothing to write home about. What disappointed me though were the spicy maki rolls. The filling was a weird paste like consistency made of fish, spicy mayo and crunch. It was literally a homogenous paste, you could not discern the three ingredients. The one maki roll I liked was the dynamite roll--the shrimp was quite good. The sushi was good, but once again nothing to write home about.   So why am I giving 3/5? The service was very good. Our server was very, very nice and soft spoken. The service was quick, courteous and efficient. And at the end, we got a wonderful complimentary green tea ice cream sundae--complete with whip cream, chocolate sauce and sprinkles! Very nice of them!  Overall, if you're curious, give it a shot. However, I will not be making the long trip to Etobicoke just for this!    On to the next sushi place! :-)"}
{"text":"Okay. So this review is based on about a year long love/hate relationship with Kumo. When I first found out about this place, I was obsessed. Great food, amazing service (they got to know me and would give me free dessert)... how could you go wrong?   But over the past little while their quality has been hit or miss. Sometimes, everything is delicious. Others, I get sushi that's falling apart and my boyfriend gets tiny slices of sashimi compared to the usual huge chunks. Along with dining in, I order delivery quite a bit. On SO many occasions, too many to count, there's been an item missing or an incorrect charge on the bill. When you call to correct said issue they get defensive and say they're right but they'll do you the favour and fix it, and then hang up on you. And at a certain point it gets incredibly frustrating to feel like that customer that's calling to complain... but when you order/pay for 6 rolls and receive 4, something needs to be said. And on plenty of occasions after complaining and being told they'll send out the missing items, they never arrive and I've had to make yet another unpleasant call. Which is obviously not something any paying customer wants to do.   After all of these issues, I've stopped ordering from Kumo as much. Which is a shame because they have some of the best miso soup around. Perhaps I've just had bad luck with them, but I just can't get past some of the bad experiences regardless of how good their food can be."}
{"text":"I have both eaten here and had delivery on a number of occasions.  There quality and service has declined significantly.  After having waited over an hour and a half for delivery service the food we got was terrible.  The peas in the rice were rock hard either not cooked properly or severely freezer burnt.  There sushi was not rolled properly and literally almost each piece fell apart.    The delivery person explained it was busy which I understand but that is no excuse for poor quality."}
{"text":"Excellent value, creative rolls, fresh fish, and very helpful staff. Definitely one of the better sushi locations around the area"}
{"text":"Sushi in a surprising place. Bento box items were nothing special, but the one \"fancy\" roll we ordered on the side was fabulous, both in taste and to look at. Service was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. If I had more money to throw around, I would go back and order whatever the chef recommends, it seems their best dishes are the more upscale, artistic creations. Don't bother with the cooked items or California rolls!"}
{"text":"The service was super great. The menu looks like there is lots of options. I was not impressed with the setting or furniture. I didn't like almost any of the food! Nothing was bad. But the teriyaki sauce was too sweet and heavy. The roles were ok. The fish seemed safe to eat but not super fresh looking. It also was not cheap at all.  I would not return."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday (today) with my girlfriend. We ordered the rock n shrimp, volcano roll, spiderman roll, and dynamite roll. On top of that, the kind restaurant management and staff gave us free ice cream and soft shell crab! :) :)  The portion sizes are good, prices are fair, and we are over-stuffed. The staff are very attentive and polite.  First time here but we will definitely be repeat customers soon!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food! It was very busy, but they were all over it. Our main took a little longer than we would have liked, but they brought us an extra appetizer on the house, then brought dessert on the house!"}
{"text":"Yes. Hole in the wall for sure.   Excellent service. They bring lots of complimentary items and bump up the service.   I was not a fan of the food. It was run of the mill regular - medium quality sushi.   Price we paid was $25 per person. I have had better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Fantastic rules you will never see anywhere else artfully done and mmmmm delicious.  Our hostess was extremely attentive and suggested to us some amazing appetizers to go with our sushi rolls.  Definitely will come by again the next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband a few years ago, absolutely the best sushi in Toronto! Excellent service, very creative chef and even got a delicious free side (I believe something similar to a crab snowball). We have since moved to the area and have gotten takeout a few times. Still delicious as it was a few years ago. Dining in is definitely recommended. Love this place and looking forward to going there often now that we're in the neighbourhood. Don't let the location fool you, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Looks like nothing from outside in & yet the service is excellent with surprising and harmonious foodie finds. Unique combinations of sweet & savory flavors make this such a delightful experience. If you have a gluten sensitivity you'll have lots of options & the staff is so accommodating they have made things custom for us a few times.  Take out or dine in, it's worth the trip to Etobicoke, & it's just south of the Gardiner."}
{"text":"Decent quality for takeout sushi - staff is friendly and food is consistent. A little on the pricey side for outside the city and the state of the restaurant (cheap and cheerful). Recommended for takeout when you want something local."}
{"text":"I like this place. Is it the best place for sushi in the city? No. But is the service fantastic? Yes.  FOOD:  I have tried an array of their maki rolls including both the plain and creative versions, as well as some of their Chinese and Thai dishes - the Sweet and Sour Chicken, general Tao chicken, and Pad Thai.   Rather predictably for a place with \"Sushi\" in the name, the Chinese and Thai dishes tasted like they were made with packaged sauce. Crispy veggies and a nice presentation do help, but not enough to make the dishes stand out.  The sushi is good. They have a variety of the typical rolls you'll find at any sushi joint if you want to play it safe, but make sure to give at least one of their original rolls a chance. On any given day they will have at least 5 new \"Special rolls\" not on their menu that change daily. I've never seen any of them twice.  SERVICE: I've taken my elderly mother who does not understand the appeal of raw fish twice, and both times the waitress has been extremely helpful in suggesting things she would like. Not only that, but when we returned for our second visit months after the first, she remembered exactly what she liked.  If you're lucky when you eat in, the kitchen may be experimenting with new dishes and you'll get to try something you would normally never order for free. The only problem is you may end up with too much tasty food and have to \"roll\" yourself home!  The wait staff is incredibly friendly, and if you don't see what you would like on the menu, don't worry about it. The chef's are extremely accommodating and can make up whatever you'd like. Any questions, just ask."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! Eric the chef puts together combinations for your palate. It's a small place and doesn't look much on the outside but the food is spectacular! Don't waste eating stuff like sashimi---ask for the volcano rolls and the king tuna. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Kumo on a Saturday night around 7pm for dinner. The place was busy with only a few free tables. I took this as a good sign as the restaurant was located a bit out of the way meaning that people think this place is worth driving for.  -Décor- Décor is a little rough and dated and doesn't correspond to the price of the food. The tables and booth seating is basic and worn and the walls need a fresh coat of paint. There isn't much \"Japanese\" décor to the place (if that matters to you). There's some neat lighting fixture behind the sushi bar but that's about it. The décor isn't going to wow you and is better suited to take friends/family/s.o. here rather than business clientele/first date/any first impression situation. I'm not saying this place is a dive but there isn't any wow factor.  -FOOD- We ate:  Tempura appetizer (2 shrimp, 2 yam, 2 zucchini ~ $7) Rock n Shrimp (chopped shrimp tempura with 2 types of dipping sauce ~ $12) TNT (imitation crab, mushroom, scallops baked in a creamy and spicy sauce topped with tobiko. It was like a casserole ~ $11) Spicy Tuna, California, salmon combo plate Sweetheart Roll (don't remember what was in it but the roll is molded to look like a heart) Fantastic Roll (shrimp tempura in the middle with avocado and a white fish on top) Japanese pop and Asahi beer  The food was okay; rolls were similar as any other in-kind sushi restaurant. Didn't taste the fish much in any of the rolls (quality? freshness? portion size? I don't know) and I feel that the spicy mayo was used too much to compensate in the lack of flavour elsewhere. One bonus here is the rice is appropriately portioned to the roll; whereas, a lot of places use too much rice to fill you up. Rolls 2/5  The tempura was good and consistent with what you'd expect: 3/5  The Rock N Shrimp is just friend tempura shrimp chopped up with a sweet and a spicy dipping sauce. Don't bother getting this and tempura. Good portion size but you pay for it. 3/5  TNT - Was good and really different than anything I've had. Likely not a Japanese dish (just Japanese inspired items in a casserole) but it was pretty good. Ask to go easy on the mushrooms unless you really like mushrooms. 3.5/5  BONUS  The food was okay; and maybe a little expensive for what you are getting (Bill came to $90) but they give you a lot of little freebies (salad, soup, free two piece roll on special, 2 scoop ice cream, mango  mocha).   The salad has a better than expected sesame dressing. Same miso soup as everywhere else.   We were given two pieces of a special roll they were making; sushi sandwich. The roll looked like 2 sandwich halves cut diagonally. The bread was a soft rice paper with a spicy crab/fish filling. It was actually amazing (both presentation and flavour) and would order this next time I go.  The ice cream was a scoop of green tea and strawberry with whipped cream. A step up from what most Japanese places give you. They also gave us a slice up mochi ball (mango). Never had one of these before but it was really good.  -SERVICE- Although there is a bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff (don't hate me, I'm not being judgemental, its true), but the service is awesome; they try really hard and do a great job. We had one main waitress who was very friendly and did a great job at explaining the different house rolls and etc. Honestly, it seems like a small thing but I ordered a beer and when the waitress brought it out she opened the can in front of me and poured it into a chilled beer mug and wiped up any condensation that was left on the table. Something really easy like that is often overlooked by wait staff in Toronto. Attention to detail was definitely paid by the staff. We had a team of three waitresses bringing our food, removing dishes, checking drinks etc. All of them were very friends and social. No bad attitude and no indifference. As unassuming as Kumo is, the service here is absolutely excellent.  -SUMMARY- It's hard for me to say whether or not I like Kumo. I really want to like Kumo because the service was stellar and friendly but the food and décor were barely average for a regular Canadian style Japanese resto and probably a little short for the price point. The jury is out on this one...."}
{"text":"Not my favorite... I am not a fan of the food. Sushi wasn't very fresh. I am not a fan, sorry.  Service was great tho. I'll rate the service five stars."}
{"text":"Sashimi was great but the roll I ordered.. not so much. The only reason they got stars from me is because the sashimi was fresh and really did melt in your mouth. I would possibly give it another chance and try a different roll, but if it turned out to be like the first, never again."}
{"text":"Kumo has a very special place in my heart and tummy! I found this restaurant while driving around the Queensway Theatre. What attracted me was the massive grand opening sign that said 20% off! I couldn't have been more happier that I walked into this place.  The owners are super nice from the get go and I have developed a relationship with them as I am now a regular. They have given us complimentary dishes on the house every time I visit for being one of their first customers. Free food, what more can you ask for lol they are also willing to make whatever type of sushi you want, even if it's not on the menu and it will taste delicious!  Make sure you try their teriyaki beef sushi (not on the menu) and the tempura banana on ice cream, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly service. Quality ingredients.  Clean, comfortable atmosphere. My friend and I stopped in for dinner and were pleasantly surprised by this little place. Best sushi in this part of town for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Kumo Japanese restaurant and I will be back again!  It's is the only healthy yummy option in the area. Went for the lunch special $10.95 for your choice of 3 rolls with soup and salad . What a deal! We got eel and cucumber, Tokyo roll and Alaska roll. Everything was fresh, yummy and made to order. We shared the lunch special so portions were good.   Can't go wrong with this place friendly service, fair prices, good quality. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for a work party and at first it seemed appealing. Until my first order. I decide to go ala carte. Big mistake. I ask if the sushi ala carte is for 1 piece or two. The server checks and says for 2 pieces. Not bad close to 5-6 dollars per order. So I order up all the sushi I desired. Later on I'm then told that its actually 1 piece per order. Really? That should have been enough for me to say forget it. How can you not know? So my 10 pieces is going to run me up to 60-70 dollars??? Wow I can't express to you how upsetting that is. I could have gone to a slew of places and have gotten much higher quality sushi for more at that dollar. Unfortunately a coworker loves this place and since I'm among people I opt to not make a scene and accept. Then the server tells me the uni sushi I ordered would be better as a shot, so she recommends me to do an uni shot instead. Who am I to reject a recommendation from the chef? So I agree. A few minutes later I'm told the don't have the fresh scallop so they recommend to replace my 1 piece with the seabass. By this time I'm fuming inside but sure, if you don't have it you don't have it, what can I do. Later on I'm then told they don't have the giant clam or the ika sushi as well and recommends the octopus instead. I decline and the server asks again, and I decline receiving a frown from the server.  First comes my uni shot that was sitting in a really sour ponzu sauce killing anything that uni had to offer. Then I quickly realize that the uni was in fact the cooked kind making me wonder if they even had the raw uni at all. By this stage I'm gutted and not looking forward to what's ahead. The sushi pieces come out 2 at a time making me wonder if anyone knows what's going on at all. Then the seabass sushi to replace my 1 piece was actually a seabass appetizer!! Really? Was this an attempt to keep my bill high because you didn't want to lose out on the 2 other pieces you didn't have? Now I'm feeling like I'm being ripped off. The sushi quality was really no better then the majority of places you go to, the sushi had large cuts with ball barring rice while the sashimi cuts were paper thin. Don't get me started on the toro if you can call it that being still frozen when served to me. Never again will I go there. For the amount I spent I'd rather go to Mifune sushi in J-town with slow service but amazing quality for 10-20 dollars less."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and we really enjoyed ourselves!   I think the best part about this place is the service - they are very attentive and based on our experience plus reading the other reviews on here, there is always one or two items \"on the house\" which is an added bonus :)  The food is yummy and they have a very interesting selection of specialty rolls.   As a group of 5, we ordered 4 lunch specials + 3 specialty rolls + one appetizer of tempura + a couple of sodas and our bill came to $120! Remember, this is lunch! So although the food is good, be prepared to pay a hefty price. This is the reason that I've removed a star."}
{"text":"Selected for a family birthday dinner based on Yelp reviews - which were bang on.  great experience and great food.  several special extras, perhaps because the staff could tell we were first-timers.  we'll be back."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi places I've been to.  I had a  chicken Pad Thai and a dynamite roll.  Plus the server brought us a dish on the house to try.    I have never left a sushi place with left overs, but in this case I couldn't eat everything.  The portion sizes are extremely generous.   The service was exceptionally professionally and friendly.   Although I just happened to be in the area, this is \"destination\"  worthy place.  I would definitely travel from where ever I am to eat here."}
{"text":"What a find!  I read about this place in Toronto Life recently and ate there tonight.  Everything that other reviewers have said is true.  The setting isn't great (a strip mall on Kipling) but the service and food are GREAT and the prices are reasonable.  I was with a fairly large group, so I got to try a lot of different things.  All of the rolls, as well as the sashimi, were delicious.  So was the sushi tiramisu, which was given to us on the house.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! I have been here 3 times and every time the service is beyond great! The staff is beyond attentive and incredibly personable. Every time I've been here the staff has included free dishes. This time in particular I ordered I sushi roll off the menu and they offered to custom make one with my favourite items. They brought out exactly what I asked and more complete with gold flakes.  The decor is simple but every other aspect of this restaurant is well above par!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite when we found this place. Have to be honest, a little #skeptical when we walked in, but was pleasantly surprised! Fish was fresh, the Maki rolls were very good  I love the rolls that come with lots of filling and just enough rice. Definitely recommend the spicy girl roll! Between my mister and I, the sushi deluxe for 2 and the spicy girl roll - we were more than stuffed!"}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming.  The outside of this restaraunt and inside leave something to be desired if you're looking for an abient experience, or something upscale. That's where my personal bad experience ends.   The staff are super friendly, remember us, are very giving and kind. We've been privy to new creations, specialty items not on the menu, complimentry items. We easily spend 70+ dollars here each time and could easily spend more.  THE most savory, balanced, delicate and absolutely delicious rolls I've ever eaten. Great place to take friends to. If you love sushi you need to try their food. The Heavenly Tower is sweet but absolutely beautiful to eat. Fuck... I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Average price, food quality not amazing by any means, customer service a bit tricky due to language barrier.  A few co-workers decided to order sushi for lunch, so I joined in. The price was not bad averaging at $1 per piece of sushi (if it's more than that, I consider it high, if it's less I consider it low, hence the \"average\" rating price-wise).  The quality of the food was quite low, where I found the rice to be very dried out, and the piece of sashimi I ordered that came with my chirasi sushi lunch were not very fresh either. The lettuce that came with the sashimi was not at all edible due to the taste (I found it to be extremely bitter) and the salad and miso soup I found to be sub-par at best.  My co-workers had to confirm the location of my work several times before the people on the phone could understand it, which can be quite frustrating.  Also their ginger was served in those little pre-made packs, which I wasn't a fan of. I did however like the higher intensity of their wasabi.  All-in-all, I don't see me ordering from Kumo again. I find Tokyo Sushi has comparable prices, however the quality of their sushi/sashimi is tonnes better, in my experience. Furthermore, comparing the chirasi meal between the two venues, Tokyo Sushi makes their miso soup with mushroom which I absolutely love, their rice is to die for, and 9.5 times out of 10, the quality of their fish is out of this world. I'm definitely choosing Tokyo Sushi over Kumo Sushi based on the fact that they're both more or less within the same distance from where I work."}
{"text":"Overall, we did like the sushi here. There were some great menu items and a variety of food and drinks to choose from. Pretty standard sushi restaurant if you ask me...We probably will stick closer to home though in the Buffalo area."}
{"text":"On this holiday, there weren't many choices today. It was a tossup between Korean BBQ or Sushi tonight.   Since my gf and I didn't want to drive to Bloor for K BBQ and Kumo was relatively close by, it was a no brainer.    A very small quaint restaurant off of Evans on Kipling in a strip mall, you would never think such a place could pack a punch.  We ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combo. Came with salmon, tuna, white fish and some rolls.  The price was relatively good and we had a friendly server.  She always said \"my friend\" at our table.   We went simple but there is a lot to choose from on the menu, no one can go wrong.  I'm sure if we had patience and our hunger wasn't taking over our brains, we would have decided on some other items.  Next time!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 I was introduced to this restaurant by my brother and his girlfriend. Seeing as how his gf lives walking distance away from it, so they go here quite often. Sure, it may not be an \"Authentic\" Japanese restaurant. But I don't think it even states that it is. If authentic is what you're aiming for, there are other places to check out. And the decor may not be appealing, but what makes us come back here are the food and friendly service (Amy, the lead waitress knows us by name and engages in a conversation with us every time). We come here for their unique take on sushi rolls, which they have a wide variety to choose from. I suggest looking on the white board to see the specials they have for the day. I get a different sushi roll every time I come here, so I can't really recommend some. I suggest trying any of them, whichever suits you and surely it'll be good. The sauce that accompanies it is tasty and adds a different flavour to sushi. When I feel like having a variety of items, I go for the beef teriyaki Bento Box. I ask for the beef to be cooked rare and they gladly did so (It's served rare too!) The salad dressing that comes with the salad is outstanding. I asked what it was one time and they said it's homemade. It's their own version of Thousand Island dressing.  What's stopping me from giving this restaurant the full 5 stars, is one small issue. There was one time I had to use the restroom and I felt uncomfortable. As soon as you open the door leading to the washroom, there's a dark hallway, which isn't even lit and on your left is the washroom and the door could barely close. That was the first and last time I ever used their restroom. Other than that, this place is fantastic and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We happen to be here for late lunch and found they open through day.  Inside is clean and here is managed by Chinesei people. Menu is combination of Japanese food and Thai food.  Taste is good enough even for Japanese.   Kumo Sushi @ Tronto, Ontario, Canada ???  ????????????????2km?????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????50?????????  ???????????????????????OK??????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????3??????????????????????????????GOOD?  ??????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????? ???????????  ??????????????"}
{"text":"Great people and nice rolls but not very authentic. Somewhat Americanized sushi restaurant. The magical roll was good very cool to have eggplant on top of a spicy tuna, but I find everything has a mayo or sauce to it. Not bad if you like that sort of thing.  I don't particularly fancy it though."}
{"text":"Our last visit was unsavoury. Kumo's quality and service is on the decline. I am hopeful that they'll again climb back to the excellence I experienced in 2012 but until I see the reviews improve, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've had great experiences here and continue to drop in anytime I'm in the mood for sushi. The food is so good, especially their special bbq style sauce they drizzle on top. You have to try their eel cakes. One of the waitresses is so nice that she always greets me with an enthusiastic smile."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my family for Family Day and the food was excellent. The waitress gave us salad and miso soup for our appetizer. We ordered their Japanese bento lunch boxes and it was delicious and it came with alot. I had the chicken teriyaki bento box and it came with tempura, 6 pieces of California sushi, 3 pieces of siomai (very yummy) and rice. Very filling. We also ordered various sashimi and their wild salmon sashimi tasted fresh and buttery. For desserts, we had fried ice cream with fried bananas and various mochi ice cream. Simple but yummy. The only waitress there was very friendly and even gave us some food that were on the house! I didn't get her name but she made our experience eating at Kumo vey delightful. She was just great overall. Kumo is now one of my favorite Japanese restaurants. It's a small and simple place but the food and service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and sashimi! The service was amazing. They gave us extras on the house and were very kind throughout the dining experience. The crab cakes were amazing as was the Spider-Man roll (I'm a comic book geek and a soft shell crab lover so I had to have it). Don't let the interior fool you, this is wayyyyy better than most sushi restaurants I've been to in the downtown core. I just wish they had a location downtown :("}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving Kumo a five star rating is because the food is a little pricey, however that is the only negative thing I can say!  I recently ate here with my son who is 11.  Service was fast and the waitress was very attentive, she even brought food for my son that he didn't order (miso soup) my meal came with it but his didn't, I thought that was nice.  The sushi is amazing and very fresh!  I also especially love their specialty rolls.  The waitress also brought my son some icecream for dessert which we never ordered but was a very nice gesture.  I do recommend this place, it's easy to drive by it as the store front is set back from the street and somewhat nondescript.  If you are in the area defintiely check it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful waitress, probably the most friendliest waitress that I've ever seen in Asian resto.  I tried Bento sashimi and snow mountain roll. Both were decent.   I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Japanese restaurant to eat at in Toronto.  The server is always so friendly and genuinely makes a good effort to ensure you enjoy your meal.  I usually don't like tempura, but it came with my bento box and it was delicious!  Great quality food and service.  Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch after reading the reviews here. The servers couldn't have been nicer in spite of minor language difficulties and the food was very good!!! Price point was excellent for lunch specials and I agree with most people here that the decor leaves much to be desired but hey...for the price, you can't have EVERYTHING!!! All in all, a pleasant experience and I will go back!"}
{"text":"This place is truly special, offering a vast variety of plates. Chef Eric is extremely flexible and creative. I often find myself just ordering him to make what he feels is tasty and I am never disappointed. My boyfriend is a sushi convert as a result..which is saying a lot because this man would never have gone near raw fish a year ago. The sauces are all made in-house and what's most impressive is you do not need any soy sauce to enhance the sushi, as it is topped with complementing sauces that keep us coming back. The fish is very fresh and is meticulously cut. Something not often found in midrange strip mall sushi restaurants. The server Amy is very friendly and has a good memory for details. She will most likely remember you after visiting once. The service is sometimes slow when it is busy due to the small staff size but the genuine warmth you get far outweighs this small detail. All in all a great place to take your friends, or a date, especially if they are new to sushi or are looking for something outside of the norm. Guaranteed a special night."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The staff is so nice. The food was fantastic. I would definitely recommend coming here and I will be coming back. The bento box BBQ beef ribs were so flavourful and tender.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"This is now our go to place for sushi.  The specialty rolls are extremely creative and delicious.  The server is wonderful in making recommendations.  We let her order for us.  The menu has a variety of Thai and Chinese dishes.  normally, this would have been a turnoff.  The quality of food is really excellent.  The chef takes enormous pride in his preparation.  We learned that he was trained in Japan and worked in the new York/new jersey are for mny years."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that the service here is amazing. The lady server is so nice and cheerful!!  Food though was just ok. While everything tasted fresh, there was too much sauce. We got the Connection roll and the Springtime roll, and both had a bit too much sauce on top which overpowered the fresh fish and roll ingredients.   For app, we got the calamari which was good. It was crispy and recently fried with light batter. The sauces it came with were overpowering though. We got a fried yellowtuna plate on the house which was really yummy, but also doused in too much sauce.  Lastly, we ordered the deep fried cheesecake with mochi. Again, it was covered with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and sprinkles which I thought was over the top and not necessary.  I think the food here could actually be excellent, except that the real flavours are being masked with sauces and frills."}
{"text":"Order delivery on a Saturday night. The sashimi is very large pieces, quality and taste okay but not great. The blacken tuna was amazing. However the salmon avocado roll, salmon roll and spicy salmon roll were all very old fish. We couldn't eat half of the order due to it not being fresh. I would not recommend this sushi place nor would I order from it again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far, and each time it is fantastic. The etobicoke roll is my favorite. It is so packed full of ingredients I couldn't even finish it. Very generous portions. Staff was friendly and attentive even though I was doing takeout. Seaweed salad is awesome as well. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"my bf and i decided to check this out as we were looking for a place to go out on a friday.  needless to say, it was a disappointment.  food was not good quality compared to other places for sushi/sashimi especially for the price.  you can definitely find much better quality for the price if you travel 10 more minutes west.  especially for raw fish - i'd rather travel further or pay more for good sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi menu, very creative dishes. Reasonably priced.  Best place for sushi in west Toronto"}
{"text":"Been here tons of times, I love this place !!!!! and their Sashimi's are chopstick licking good !"}
{"text":"If I could give 0.5 or 0 stars I would.  First of all, the place is not really a Japanese place. You know from the furniture, decoration and the music they place. It is a Chinese restaurant that also serves some sushi and Thai menu. I think Toronto and Etobicoke now has abundance of international cuisine that is AUTHENTIC. I'm surprised this place has decent reviews - maybe the other clients have not tried real sushi in the area.  The sushi and rolls Conmbo for lunch was TERRIBLE with dried rice. Specially The roll was so roughly done. The sushi nigiri has fish that was till frozen. The miso soup comes in a tiny dish that they use to HOLD the Chinese spoons. The salad that comes with the lunch combo is full of withered vegetables that I did not touch.  The tempura was Yellow with very low quality vegetable.  The ginger is full of some chemical taste, didn't touch.  If you have any experience eating sushi you will agree with this review but hopefully I have just saved you from wasting money and having a bad taste in your mouth after."}
{"text":"This was an amazing lunch. Will definitely be back. Hospitality was exceptional!! Great food!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Waitresses were friendly and gave us appetizer and dessert on the house. I had the chicken teriyaki box. It was delicious and big. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a whole in the wall restaurant with big flavor and fresh sashimi! My husband and I were incredibly taken by the creativity of the menu and the hospitality of our hostess. We were treated like valued patrons. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is located on a busy little strip mall off Kipling in a somewhat industrial part of town. As expected, the restaurant is no high-end dining experience. Instead, this is a Chinese-run hole-in-the-wall, complete with laminated greasy menus, wooden snap chopsticks, a Japanese menu with creatively named rolls (Alligator roll anyone?) with a smattering of random Chinese dishes. Cleanliness could use some work. Service was okay - a bit slow initially, the waitresses torn between the phone orders and in-house customers.   The food came quickly, and I was impressed by the quality. Tempura was crispy without any oily sogginess. The rolls were outstanding, with lots of filling and minimal rice, which is the way I like my rolls. Dessert was average to below average. Overall, this place gets a solid 3.5 stars, and I would come back for more, although ordering out may be an overall more satisfying experience."}
{"text":"I was in the area to shop at Costco and yelped places to eat around the area. I don't k ow why this place gets 4 or 5 stars?  I've had far better sushi/sashimi than this place.  Although I guess when you think about where you are location wise, you don't really have that many options.  I ordered the ceviche which was not ceviche.  It was slices of tuna and salmon drenched in some weird juices that was not marinated in citruses.  i also ordered the sashimi bento box.  Meh! not that fresh and portions were whatever.  My husband ordered the Katsu Don, which was an error on his part.  He meant to order Don Katsu, which was not on their menu.  When we received the order and realized its not what he wanted, the waitress replied by saying that he should try eating it and see if he likes it. Really?  Well, he tried and and didn't like it.  Waste of time.  He could have ordered something else right there and then instead of trying something that he didn't want and then having to wait longer for a new meal.  He ended up ordering a specialty sushi roll which was quite tasty but by the time he started eating he had lost most of his appetite.  The atmosphere is a bit dingy and not appealing, I'm always disappointed walking into a sushi place and finding out its runner by Chinese people.  I would not recommend going here and I don't think I'd go back.  By some far off chance I do end up back here, I would stick to their specialty rolls and that's about it.  Thank goodness I live downtown and I have 100's of options when it comes to eating at a sushi restaurant,"}
{"text":"Big difference between friendly and PUSHY. Asked multiple times if we wanted MORE food, at least 3 times.  We ordered 2 big meals, plus appetizer, it's enough.  Then the push for desserts, multiple times.  Left feeling awkward and slightly annoyed.  Felt like a nail saloon that harrasses you for extras w manicures, pedicures.  Some days it feels like it's best to just not leave the house.."}
{"text":"This was a find.  The service was really good, and they just brought us a ton of tasty dishes.  quite frankly I'm not sure what we had, but it was all great.  Lots of unique dishes at this place.    Some of the items can be really really saucy, but otherwise it was great.  I will definitely be back and maybe with a review with more details.  They have really cool japanese soda.  It was a little sweet but fairly tasty."}
{"text":"good and fresh sushi. service is great. Apart from sushi they also have a decent offering of Thai food."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from Kumo too many times to count. I've always been happy with the food, the person who delivers is as nice as can be, and they have mochi."}
{"text":"Very good value! Like everyone said, the service is exceptional. Food quality is pretty good for the price we paid. The decor of the restaurant is very outdated, but I personally didn't mind it all that much.  We got the sushi sashimi for two. We got some salad and white miso to start. Then we got some fried fish app on the house! Our sushi came out beautifully presented on ice. The selection of fish were pretty standard, but good in quality. A Godzilla roll was included, which had plenty of spicy mayo. A tuna roll was also included. Fish were fresh, but the rice could have been better, hence 4/5 stars - it was a bit hard.  We also got one green tea ice cream because one of us was too stuffed for dessert. The server brought us a huge portion of the ice cream with fried bananas on the side so we could share! For less than $50, it was a very decent meal."}
{"text":"Upgrading to five stars. Their \"regular\" rolls and sashimi are excellent across the board. Service is fast and friendly. Truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love the waitstaff here and the rolls are more fresh here than other sushi placed around this area. That said everything is generally good, but not spectacular. The portions are also pretty small so I end up buying two of the same roll to get my sushi fill. Not a fan of the mango salad. I would say stick to the sashimi and rolls offered."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy eating here despite the bad reviews. Food is pretty good. No experience in getting frozen fish in our sushi. Only negative review is the washroom looking dirty. Will come back for the food and good service!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a friend. Very friendly staff and fresh food. The tuna was great! We had the sushi combo for 1 and a bowl of edamame. Was more than enough food.  One question, why does almost every Japanese restaurant serve you crappy iceberg lettuce with a mix of Big Mac sauce and sesame? Dish on the house wasn't bad either. Overall a really good place but not much else around in terms of food in the area."}
{"text":"My worst sushi meal ever.  The first visit was edible, with nice service, but the 2nd visit was the worst spent $ on any food in my life.   Me and my partner and the other couple tables that were there left with discarded food. There was a person cooking who didn't seem to be a chef more like a random cook. The combo rolls I ordered had no fish in it, the rice was also poor, my partners sashimi was bland and old tasting. The Special rolls and the sauces they smear all over everything and cooking their Sushi was very horrible. Nothing tastes Japanese. We left after not eating the entire day agreeing it was one of our worst meals ever.  Will never go back, doesn't matter how nice you are, if your going to serve that and charge for it $ stay closed that day that's the nicer thing to do."}
{"text":"fantastic sushi and service!   decor is very unassuming but the meal will have a lasting impression long after you leave.   sushi and maki were fresh, light and perfectly balanced. chef sent a complimentary sample that was outstanding (apricot roll, all spicy salmon roll, all avo, no filler, pure delicious). will definitely have to order next time. staff was very friendly and helpful, too.   will become a regular here for dine in and delivery!"}
{"text":"I just tried Kumo for the first time and was really happy with the service and food! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The sushi and beef teriyaki were fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend Kumo to anyone looking for delicious and affordable Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place is undeniably one of the best sushi restaurants in south Etobicoke!  It's in a small strip plaza on Kipling just south of Evans.  We've tried a number of their special rolls and we've never been disappointed.  The sashimi just melts in your mouth - it's quite apparent that they use the very best of ingredients. We order take-out at least twice a week but some menu items are a little on the pricey side.  Having said that, definitely worth every penny though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Was looking for some late night sushi in Etobicoke and found this place on Yelp. The restaurant is a bit of a dive and is location in a small plaza off of Kipling.   My fiancé and I ordered the walnut shrimp and 2 special rolls. The walnut shrimp was great, shrimp was nicely cooked and the sauce wasn't too overpowering and the walnuts add a nice crunch. The 2 special rolls we had were great too although I don't remember exactly remember which ones we had, possibly the alligator roll and the godzilla roll. We were also given a complimentary appetizer (fried hamachi) which was a nice touch. To finish, a complementary plate of mochi was given as well which was good.   Overall, the food and the service was great, but the restaurant itself and the location leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We ordered from their maki and specialty maki and everything was truly so good. Fresh and delicious. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Customer service - after reading the reviews, this was the main reason I came here. Such great service very attentive and complimentary appetizer was a nice touch. They even gave me a larger portion of wakame salad because that was my \"main\". Very friendly and quick service, yet they dont rush you out of there.   Food - everything we had was pretty good! My mom ordered the salmon Teriyaki combination box, which was huge, but she said it was good. The complimentary appetizer was actually very good -  a fried sushi roll of sorts with a teriyaki sauce. The hot & sour soup was ok, a bit gelatinous.   Would definitely return! (especially because the theatre is right around the corner)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended . Amazing teriyaki boxes and delicious tasty sushi. You have to try their special rolls. Service is very quick and friendly"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why people have a hate on for this place... sure, there are a lot of options in the neighbourhood, but this (for us) is one of the better ones. There's also some negatives on authenticity - and I'm 100% fine with people mixing cuisines, or Chinese people making Japanese food. Canadian restaurants cover everything from stir frys to pasta, so I feel we get a bit hypocritical there.   Pro - lovely people, some unique options, big menu, tasty food, some interesting sauces served with the rolls, fresh tasting, and nice quiet place.   Con - not the cheapest in the neighbourhood (but the portions are big), not decorated in any particular way (if you care about that), and not the fastest takeout ever (so call ahead). I think they deliver, but there is some mixed information on payment methods accepted that way.   Lastly, if you want REAL sushi, sure. Go to a place that's more hardcore about that. This is like sushi style comfort food with a lot of indulgent kind of rolls and deep fried things with sauce. But all honestly very good for that."}
{"text":"Good fast to-go service. The for was decent Ave tasted well. The location is convenient and clean. The staff was friendly. The sushi was good."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are cheap...but their amazingness lays within their specialty rolls and foods. Probably the widest, greatest variety of sushi in all of the GTA.  They brought me a complimentary sushi dish I believe was called \"Rockin' Salmon\" and it was by far one of the nicest spicy sushi dishes I have ever tasted in my life.  The service is also super efficient, fast, and the friendliest you will EVER find!! I strongly recommend their special dishes you won't find anywhere else. Like their Sushi Tiramisu with spicy sauce. Basically the weirder it sounds the better."}
{"text":"Expensive but most places in Toronto is.  Sushi was tasty. Service was great. They explained everything and how they cook/prep everything. They don't serve rolls with soy sauce as they infuse sauce and flavor into them but we still needed sauce and wasabi.   Nice that it's in a building with a ramp. Big restaurant, fancy. Luckily we dressed up as everyone was dressy there."}
{"text":"I had Chicken Teriyaki Bento but it was not good. It was like steamed strips of chicken and they just put teriyaki sauce on top.  I think their specialty are rolls though. I had dragon rolls from a previous visit and today they gave us 4 pcs. of deep fried seafood rolls on the house and they were very good!  I like the miso soup and green salad as well.   I was going to rate this place a 2 because of not so great bento but giving 3 for friendly service and rolls on the house was a nice touch.  If you come here, probably better to go with rolls."}
{"text":"I dont usually do updated reviews of places, but i really wanted to sing the praises of Kumo.  Such creativity in their dishes! They are very kind, and the portions are of a fantastic size. I have been there enough times, that i let the main chef order for me....except for my standard order of the New Year Roll. (Spicy Salmon, topped with Salmon, Tuna and whitefish, covered in this spicy honey sauce and avocado cream.) So goddamn good.  Again, DONT LET THE LOCATION FOOL YOU! this is some of the best sushi i have had in this city, hands down."}
{"text":"Went to Kumo Sushi because Spoon and Fork were jam packed for lunch. The food was not a good experience at all. I played it safe by ordering generic rolls like spicy salmon and spicy tuna which, even store bought boxed gets right. All the rolls tasted exactly the same. I couldn't tell which one was which.  It wasn't a good experience at all. The two stars are only for the great service and friendly waitress who made the lunching experience bearable."}
{"text":"Came to this place after finding it on yelp, and didn't regret it. First off, the service was so good. They were super friendly and were very attentive to everything we needed. The food was good, high quality Japanese. We got bento boxes, and the quantity compared to other places I've gone was way more. A lot came with it. They also make their salad dressing homemade and it was super good. They gave us an appetizer and a sample of a desert they had. All in all, I had a really good experience there and would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and was thoroughly underwhelmed. Service was friendly, quick, and attentive, but not enough to make up for the poor quality of the food.   I ordered the beef teriyaki bento. The salad was soggy and drenched in dressing. The beef was grilled to just medium, but was still tough and chewy. The tempura was the most disappointing: the batter was thick and doughy, not crispy at all, and extremely greasy. The California roll was okay, but that is almost impossible to screw up. To top it all off, the bento box itself smelled faintly of a dirty dish rag.  There's plenty of other places close by where i can grab a much better quality lunch for much less. I doubt I would be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Service is super friendly, welcoming and helpful! Our waitress came over ready to help us decide and recommended the  baby yellowtail as an app and it blew my mind, last time I had something similar was at a restaurant in NYC called Nobu!   For our main we got the Sushi/Sashimi for (2) and it came served over ice, presentation was beautiful and the sushi was fresh and yummy! The Godzilla roll was fantastic too!   Definitely would recommend this place, rated as 4 stars only because of the decor it could be updated but if your looking for quality over ambiance this place is not to be missed. It's about 5 mins from the Cineplex too!"}
{"text":"The servers were really friendly, really approachable. They seemed to know all the people in the restaurant. I guess the place thrives on regulars.  The food was okay. We got 2 special rolls and the combination box, salmon teriyaki. I enjoyed the combination box, good portion of salmon. The rolls were okay as well. Ion addition to what we ordered, we were also given a dish on the house. It was battered fish with spicy mayo. It was delicious.  All in all, it was a good meal. I didn't give it 5 stars because the restaurant was a little sticky; the floor to the table and the chairs."}
{"text":"So went here today with the folks from the company I'm working with today.  Place doesn't look like much on outside or inside decor, but the food was good.     Had the Thai curry beef today since they do not carry GF soy sauce, which takes all sushi items off menu for me.     Great meal.    Can't give more than 3 stars to a sushi place that does not have GF soy sauce.  Especially one that has Thai food considering Thai soy sauce is naturally GF."}
{"text":"Received a lot of personal a attention was excellent, got a free dish on a house, salad was amazing, sushi and sashimi were great and fantastic! Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok so I gave this place another try.  I guess it was an off day which was what I based my last review in.  Did take out of several items and was very pleased.  Sashimi was fresh.  Rolls were very good.  The soft shell crab spider roll was ok... Have had better, but overall I was pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times now and their service is amazing. Came here a few times very tired after work and had a good relaxing bonding session with my coworkers over food.   The server there is always very nice and friendly. She alwys makes sure we are served right too, whether its tea/water or extra spicy mayo! She also sometimes bring us appetizers and dessert on the house!   This is not an authentic japanese restaurant. But their food is pretty good. Ive tried many of their special rolls and sashimi! Today was one of my coworkers birthday, so we were here again. I had:  Yellow tail: deep fried with teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo! Yummy! Best part, its on the house!   Beauty and the beast roll: It was amazing. I think it was spicy snow crab topped with some fish. Loved the spicy kick to it.   Eel and cucumber roll: my must have.   Green tea ice cream  And she brought us fried bananas on the house!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Highly recommend the Alligator Roll, but there are a lot of really interesting options so will definitely be back to try the others.  Also got a free roll and later, a dessert so that made everything even better.   Don't let the slightly outdated interior fool you; food and service is more than worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing service! Came out here with a friend and we ordered the Sashimi for two along with a specialty roll (can't quite remember what it was at this very moment). Sashimi was good and tasted pretty fresh (also had a pretty cool presentation).  The waitress was also really amazing, she gave us an extra Salmon Dish at no charge and at the end of our meal she also provided us free dessert (tempura bananas and ice cream). Would definitely come out here again if I was back in this area!"}
{"text":"Went on a week night.  Surprised it was so busy given it's location. It's easy to get to but out of the way.  We had pork katsu, age tifu, tempura appetizer and a couple of sushi rolls.  They also gave us three free dishes including deep fried bananas and mochi ice cream or dessert.  The food generally was quite good but not really outstanding.  Everything was quite decent fare except for the pork katsu which seemed to be just something that was re-heated in a microwave.  Presentation was good.  Service was well above average.  Free parking directly in front of the restaurant is a bonus."}
{"text":"The service and the food were both great! Really yummy! There were a few things my table got on the house - I'm not sure if that's usual since it was my first time there, but i was with regulars. Kinda pricey. I had the negomaki (sp?) bento box - different, and very good :) Basically it's beef wrapped around onion. Lots of stuff comes with the box - beef and rice, fried dumplings, tempura, and California roll. If you're really hungry, ordering some rolls on the side to share are a great complement to the box."}
{"text":"Just went to Kumo Sushi for Mother's Day because our usual spot was closed so we decided to give something new a shot. The service was the best there is. The staff is amazing and gave us free samples of sushi & even have us ice cream with sprinkles after the meal, which was wonderful!   However, the food was not impressive at all. Small sizes and did not taste good at all. I will stick to my regular sushi place from now on. We were not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers, service and fish quality. I am super picky about what fish and sushi places I frequent and kumo really was a good experience. The salmon ceviche appetizer was outstanding. I will return."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting sushi. So many flavours in one mouthfull. We loved the snow mountain roll and the beautiful roll. Yummy deep fried banana for dessert. Special appetizer on the house was also delicious."}
{"text":"Easy 5. I've been here in the last 2 years multiple times. I have never been disappointed. The food is amazing. Extremely nice people running this joint.  BTW it is worth the price for sure. Love goes into this food if I've ever seen it! BEST sashimi I've had! and it looks beautiful too."}
{"text":"This resto re-set my expectations for sushi in Toronto - just astounding. Check http://kumosushi.ca/ for the menu and you'll see what I mean.  We went today after reading some reviews on Yelp, not sure what to expect from a sushi restaurant in an Etobicoke industrial park. Suffice to say, the place just blew me away.  Our server was clearly busy (the only one on the floor, AND running take out), but she was also quick to knowledge us, even if to say \"I will be right with you\".  I found the service relaxed, genuine and un-intrusive, if a bit lagging at times - not that I minded.  The menu itself is diverse, with some Thai and Chinese dishes available. We only had the Japanese courses, but the table beside us had a Chinese dish and I overheard some positive comments from them. They have some fantastic special maki rolls I would urge you to try, we had the Godzilla and it was delicious!  We were given a free appetizer on the house, fried hamachi strips in both teriyaki and spicy mayo. It was a near perfect dish - not greasy, well balanced, and delicious.  We ordered the sushi sashimi combo for two, which was absolutely massive and had some of the best quality sushi and sashimi I've seen in the city. And the plating! The sushi was served on a bed of crushed ice, and the chef had sculpted a snowman onto it!  I'll have to post a picture, as words don't do it justice. One of the best under-the-radar places I've found in the city - ever!"}
{"text":"No frills, tasty sushi.  In the middle of nowhere, and definitely a hole in the wall.  Excellent service and fresh fish.  My party ordered a ton of food, and the chef sent us a few complementary dishes to boot."}
