{"text":"The memorabilia on the walls are from various sports teams.   The owner works in some capacity for the Panters and that is how he gets them to visit on occasion for special fundraisers.    The food is bar food fills your belly while watching your favorite sports team (lose unfortunately) on this visit.  Be sure to get there early to get a good table if you plan to watch, some have better views then others."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss place.  Never had the same service or food quality twice.  Solid spot to get bar food.  Open late when not many other Fort Mill restaurants are.

$2 bottles and cansbeer all day Saturday can't be beat"}
{"text":"Typical plus tavern. Staff is very friendly, attentive and helpful. Asked about the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Nachos and was told depends on who is cooking. Appreciate the honesty. Atmosphere is loud bar-like with lots of tv's which they will change to whatever game you want to see. You can watch the game without getting any pressure to leave. I like that. Drinks are poured without too much measure so you are getting what you paid for. Had the shrimp appetizer which was surprisingly tasty. Pick a sauce and it will be brought to your table. Wings - go for the \"coach style\".   Tasty and enough meat to satisfy. Not like BWW which are small expensive.  Order the fries and slaw, well worth the extra 2 bucks. Tried the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Nachos. It was a weird bland taste. Like the girl sitting across the table. Not really a strong anything to make you think you're eating something special. Overall it's a local place I'd like to hang out. Could use some more comfortable seating but then maybe I wouldn't leave. Worth the visit and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I stop by at least once a week for their AWESOME wings!  I like em' hot and Town Tavern is one of my top 3 favorite places to eat wings!!  Beer is always cold and Matt is AMAZING behind the bar!!  Remembered our names and what we drank after just 1 visit!  He even brings our drinks out to us on the patio if we decide to move out there.  All of the staff is super nice too!  One word of advise though....take a sweater or a jacket!!  I love ya Town Tavern but they keep it like a meat locker in there!!"}
{"text":"I got an order to go during my recent stay in Fort Mill.  I wanted to enjoy wings and burgers to celebrate the end of a diet for competition.  Great service over the phone when I placed my order and the Carolina Burger was great!!!  The wings were tasty.  No complaints at all about the food here."}
{"text":"A great place to catch a game in Fort Mill. We also like to go for Kids Eat Free on Sundays."}
{"text":"This is a good place to take the kids for a quick bite to eat.  I will say I have noticed recently some of the staple dinners I get have changed in portion sizes and quality for the worse.  Still a good place to go tho...I have been going since it opened."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few weeks ago with visiting family for lunch. Had an awesome California chopped salad ! Service was great , everyone was happy! I've been back twice, nice to find a local spot you can depend on."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings. I've had them just about everywhere in Fort meal, and I have never found any that are good. Town Tavern has the best wings around Fort Mill. If you like your wings crispy, tell them you want them crispy, and they will cook them that way. I could eat these things every day of my life. I don't usually order anything else, but I will check out their bingo night and any other games they have at night. Again, if you want chicken wings, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was a little unorganized, but still a solid sports bar. They were very willing to flip the channels for us, which is nice."}
{"text":"Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.

Decorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.

Towne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.

Service is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.

Overall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike."}
{"text":"Nice little sports bar in Fort Mill. Friendly Staff. My favorite thing are there chicken her nachos."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great prices.  Fries could improve"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Danny and hid crew know food and fun."}
{"text":"Very good food. Mostly bar food (sandwiches, fries, wings, etc.). Excellent wings. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Had a private reservation booked for our daughter's 21st birthday dinner. Imagine my shock when I arrived with 26 guests to find our room, booked since Jan, unavailable, They had booked over our reservation with a bachelorette party! I had just personally gone in a week before to introduce myself & see the space I had reserved. Met with the owner & manager DANNY, saw space, confirmed number of guests, and even discussed table set up, tab separations & high chair necessities. The manager on duty called him when we arrived & he denied ever meeting me! Needless to say, we will not return to Towne Tavern. We had family from 3 different states come for this dinner, & it was very upsetting not to have our space. I will say the manager on duty did his best to accommodate in the main dining area, but we decided to take our business elsewhere. Thank you to Beef o Brady's for giving us the space we needed at such short notice! Have always enjoyed Towne Tavern's food, but inexcusable service on the owner's part. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Its kind of small but cozy.  Food is good .  Good beer specials.  If they could upgrade the TV's and make sure all football games are on , on Sundays it'd be 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my wife's and I go to place. Always consistent food and great service. Monday nights free bingo, 1.00 beers and .50 wings how can you beat that?  Matt behind the bar is one of the best bartenders in the area. Try their buffalo chicken wrap tossed in Carolina gold."}
{"text":"A little slice of a northern sports bar.  Towne Tavern is what you'd expect find in a sports bar from the Midwest to the Northeast.

This is a spacious place with a backroom for get-togethers.  There are many TVs to pick out the game you want to watch.  There are always specials and options for how much you want to spend on booze.

The wings here are solid...exactly what you should expect when you want hotwings.  Yes, they serve alot of bar food, but most of the food is pretty good, so don't be afraid to try something that isn't fried (unless of course, it's the fried fish...they know how to nail this).

The service can vary a bit...but it's usually quick and friendly.  

This is a great place to meetup with coworkers, friends, or an afternoon of beer and chicken wings.

Try:  The fried haddock

Avoid:  The beef on weck (you'll want to go to Lebowski's if you want one)"}
{"text":"This place is simply terrible. I've been here 4 times because of its convenience and every entree has been far below satisfactory. The only reason it even gets two stars is because their sweet potato fries are exceptional. But if your looking to fill your belly on some real food I strongly recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great local place to watch a game!  The wings are good and the Panther room is very cool!  Variety on the menu, so everyone in the family found something they liked.  I got the fish and chips and they were great (better than McHales too!).  I love the memorabilia all over the walls and there are plenty of TVs to watch  football while enjoying the meal!"}
{"text":"Generous pours, solid pub food, excellent and friendly bartenders and staff.  Lots of TVs makes it a perfect spot to hang with friends and watch the game.

My favorites on the menu:

1.  The buffalo chicken wrap
2.  Tortilla soup
3.  Cajun penne pasta with chicken

Aside from these, just about everything else on the menu has left me pleased.  However, I can't recommend the burgers - they tend to be on the dry side.  A lot of my friends also tend to prefer the tavern chips over the fries, but I like the fries just fine.

As you can tell, I'm a regular - so take my review with a grain of salt.  But I'm a regular for a reason - its the best tavern in the Fort, and I've tried them all."}
{"text":"More of a sports bar than a restaurant. Loud-- gotta be in the party mood to enjoy the atmospere.Pub Grub! Gotta wanta have a beer!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat and enjoy a casual atmosphere.REcently however, they shortened their menu, taking away things that were very popular; the food is overcooked, and the sandwiches skimpy - $7.99 for a BLT that had 2 slices of burnt bason, I.5 slices of tomato and I lettuce leaf on thick Texas toast.  All you got was the taste of the toast.

I am not retuning!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the ribs...best ribs I've ever had, in my life, period.  And I'm what many would consider a BBQ Connoisseur.  The rest of the food is your normal bar food, something you can use to soak up a couple drinks...although their sweet tater fries are amazing as well.  

Alcohol is....well, alcohol.  They have that here.  In mass quantities.  A plus for any bar, I guess.

Did I mention the ribs?"}
{"text":"In my top three places to go for wings outside Buffalo. Anyone who says different, has had their palette ruined by crappy chain-store wings.

Other thoughts:  Decent beer specials; the pub fare tastes decent; friendly staff; good atmosphere for watching a big game; deceptively large dining area.

Cons:  This place loses a star for being a Sabres bar.  Go Leafs, go!"}
{"text":"Ok,  we have been here a ton of times so I feel I can give this place an honest and realistic rating.  First of all they have happy hour Monday thru Friday 4p to 6p $2 beers,  yes,  $2 beers.  DANGEROUS BUT SO GOOD. 

Bar finesse handled by Marley and Matt are AWESOME! They know there stuff, are very personable, and check in BEFORE happy hour ends for another brew. Ranks high in my book.  They have Bingo on Mondays and trivia on Wednesdays. 

We have had several of their food offers - Saratoga chips, island burger, and preztels. All were tasty and topnotch.... chips crispy, pretzels soft, and burger done as ordered. Also, all apps are under $10 which I am a firm believer in. 

We have been here a few late nights with not so stellar experiences; however,  overall this place is great for a cold brew and good food. Bottom line, this place has grown on me so Bravo to them."}
{"text":"Love music bingo here on Wednesday nights! The wings are delicious. Try the honey hot!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and thought to give it a try. Service was good. We were well taken care of. Food was okay and way too greasy for our liking. It was overpriced for the amount of food received. Not sure we will ever return."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good here! It's definately a family environment. On Tuesdays they do kids eat free and put all the families with kids in a separate room (which helps cut down on the racket for the rest of the guests) and put on a family movie. During the summer they do a band out on the patio and it can get pretty crazy. Most of the time though it's a happy hour crowd. Good beer specials and they always do a lunch special. Everything is homemade and there's a delicious dessert called the Dinosaur Egg which is fried ice cream. 
One warning - don't have too many drinks and then leave this place - it's a favorite of Fort Mill Police and they are always around on that stretch of road."}
{"text":"I love there beef sandwhich with the horseradish.  Best to go to the bar as service there is always spot on.   Beers are always cold."}
{"text":"Stuck in a strip mall off of 160 between Fort Mill and Tega Cay is this gem. The Towne Tavern of Fort Mill has good food at very reasonable prices. I recommend Tuesday nights when kids eat free and kids movies are shown."}
{"text":"Meh... We came in pretty early; not quite noon on a weekend - so they were just setting up -- I kind of got the impression that it was a bit of an \"imposition\" to bartender who was still prepping.  She did seem a bit more enthusiastic when the \"Regulars\" starting showing up.
I love wings -- these were nothing special; very hot -- not hot
beer specials were pretty good -- better places in Fort Mill to hang out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Good sports atmosphere. I had the French dip and it was legit! One of the best I have ever had. My wife had the fish and chips and truly enjoyed it. Cold beer, good tap selection. Reasonably priced - actually a lot of food for the money. Had the wings last time and they were as good as it gets! The service was very quick and friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We took our family here on a Sunday night, it was a nice treat that the kids were free! 
Wings- my husband got them and was pretty happy. I tasted one and it was really good, better then other wings we have had around town.
Mac and Cheese- delicious, we all really enjoyed it. It was a penne pasta with gooey cheese and shredded cheese on top. We actually ordered an additional side once we tasted it. 
Island burger- you can't go wrong here but I'm biased, it's always my favorite burger. The teriyaki sauce on the burger was a smash in my book. I would have liked a side to dip as well, really good flavor. 
Steak sandwich- my mom got this and said it was really good. I didn't taste it so I'm not sure but in her opinion she really liked it. 
Pretzels and cheese - ugh these were perfect. Warm, salted and yummy. 
Funnel fries- do I even need to describe these? Lol 

Drinks- so far every bar including this one doesn't have seltzer?! People... soda water and tonic are NOT Seltzer."}
{"text":"Since my last review this has become our family staple. We have had an awesome b-day party for our two boys in Suite 160."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Towne Tavern for dinner the other evening and elected to sit outside, because the temperature was nice. Unfortunately, this was a poor decision because of the lack of service and the other patrons who were smoking. 

This was my second time eating at Towne Tavern, although it was my first actually at the restaurant. Both times, the food was excellent. Both times I had the island burger, which is fantastic, with sweet potato fries (served with honey). 

My first time, I also had the funnel cake fries, which are delicious. When my wife and I went, we got the fried green beans, served with a wasabi dip, which was quite good. 

I am only giving it two stars because of the poor service and atmosphere. If you want a great meal to go, Towne Tavern is a great option. If you decide to go in person, eat inside."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always. Best wings in the area! Hostess terrible as always! An \"I don't care, why did you walk in the door and bother me\" attitude! The server was just as bad. Maybe if he had quit fooling with his cell phone while out in plain sight of the dining area the service would have been better than a 1 out 5. At one point I had to wave to get his attention."}
{"text":"The wings are pretty good, lots of sauce, but sometimes too spicy. It would be really helpful to have a spice meter on the menu, just something so you know what to order. The raw chips are too crunchy for my taste."}
{"text":"A nice spot, good assortment of TV'S although not big screens. Had a nice IPA on tap. Wings were extremely average. They played bingo while I was there (a Monday night). I guess they may need to do that with tge quality of tge wings and tiny TV'S but Matt the bartender is a solid dude. Just used to a little more, but again, real nice folks here."}
{"text":"This is a niche place and I don't fall in that niche, so I may not be the best reviewer. I came in on a Saturday afternoon to catch some games while I ate lunch. This place definitely caters to the older crowd. I am in my mid 30's and was way too young. Music was Beegees and the like. 
As far as watching the game, if you count number of TV's, they would get a good rating, but with the exception of maybe two, they were all under 40 inch with most under 32 inch making the games hard to see. 
I ordered 12 wings and a beer. The wings were not very good and didn't finish them. Bill was $18 which I though was way high for what I ordered. 
I will not return."}
{"text":"Most of the food here is great. Last visit, order the chips. They were horrible as if they were made months ago. When I complained, I was brought a big bowl of the same horrible chips."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar. Lots of TVs around the place. Lots of sports decor on the walls. Dimly lit so the TVs can be seen better.

The food is fine. Nothing to complain about; nothing to write home about.

Parking lot out front."}
{"text":"Had a fairly impromptu meeting tonight and had a far bigger turnout than expected. The staff did an amazing job getting our food and drinks out. All very tasty and well prepared. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food was very good and came out in a timely manner. We went around the five pm hour and brought our two kids. They ate all of their food which is rare for them!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for lunch. We were in a rush. The owner was so accommodating and served us delicious food. She went above and beyond to make sure we were served in a timely manner. The food is excellent and the owners definitely aim to please their customers!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second night that I have been in less than a week. Sure wish that I knew about this place sooner. Last week I had the steak salad and it was one of the best salads that I have had in a long time. Tonight I had the smothered grilled chicken and it was so delicious! My husband had the wings and thought they were extremely good. We also had the pretzels and jerk nachos for appetizers. Everything was way better than bar food. We are super impressed and will be back. Service was outstanding both times as well! Oh and also they had OMB copper on special for 3.50 on draft every Friday night! Double plus! Husband had a Long Island and really liked it!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go have a beer and some pub grub... The food is not bad at all, with the exception of the wings which are bland and unimpressive. And they have some good bottled beer. Unfortunately they only have two beers on tap, I would stop by more often if they would add a few taps. 

The atmoshphere is pretty standard for a sports type bar and the waitstaff seems to be friendly and attentive. 

Overall, this is a great place to stop by and have a beer, or to bring your kids.

But please... add a few more taps!!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Fort Mill area.  One time we ordered a take out of wings (of course) and yes, the reviews did not lie.  Wings were extremely good, the sauce is the killer!
We loved the vibe inside and wanted to dine in sometime and we did on a Wednesday I believe.  it was $3 coronas night!! I had chicken club sandwich and wife had a salad.  we also ordered a side of smashed potatoes.
BEST TASTING SMASHED POTATOS EVER!!! I have never had such deliciously tasting mashed potatoes ever.  asked my waiter (who is super cool, friendly, and very very attentive) if the potatoes were made in house and YES it is, even the gravy on top is made in house.  How is a sports bar doing such good mashed potatoes with gravy??
Oh and wife's salad was looking so colorful to start with and tasted so fresh and delicious.  I am sure they even cut their veggies to order and not use precut veggies (which looks dry and lifeless).
My chicken club sandwich tasted just as good as I washed it down with $3 coronas!!!
pretty sure we will be regulars here ;)"}
{"text":"This is mostly a bar/restaurant that caters to WNY transplants.  I myself lived in WNY for a while, and one of its few redeeming qualities is the food.  Towne Tavern matches 2 of the food staples there: the wings and the haddock fish fry.  In WNY, you get 4 choices of wings: hot, medium, mild, and char-b-q.  Hot is straight up Frank's hot sauce, medium is half hot sauce and half melted butter, and mild is about 2/3 melted butter and one third hot sauce.  Char-b-q wings are partially deep fried, and then placed over an open flame with sauce.  Towne Tavern doesn't serve those, but they serve the hot, medium, and mild to WNY specifications.  Yes, they have things like terriyaki flavored wings, but those would be a sin in WNY.That would be like serving iced tea from a fountain in the Carolinas.  The wings are made fresh and are very good.  

The haddock fish fry is actually better than a lot I have had in WNY. It's two large pieces of haddock beer battered served with slaw and your choice of side.

Another favorite menu item is tavern terriyaki which is grilled steak or chicken with terriyaki sauce served with a salad and cold spinach fettuccine noodles.  The combination works very well together.

The rest of the menu items such as burgers and sandwiches are slightly better than what you would find at most bars.  The WNY beef on weck sandwich is okay but it's far from what you would get in Buffalo.

They have a good selection of bottle beers, but could probably use some more on tap.  They usually only have Old Meck Copper and one other one.  The service is usually pretty good here too, though the wait staff is noticeably younger than a lot of other taverns/bars/restaurants in the area.I also give them props for being the first bar/restaurant in Fort Mill to ban smoking, and oce they had the cojones to do it, most other places stopped it before the ban even went into effect."}
{"text":"Great place, great ambiance, been about 5 times over past month. The happy hour is a fantastic deal, best in the area. The bartenders are outstanding especially the guy that works nights, their Bloody Mary's are the best I have had since moving here. So far we have had the Steak Salad, Wings, Ribs, Burgers which were all fantastic. Tried the meatloaf dinner, was good but not outstanding, could be just me as I am a meatloaf snob, Lol. The Thursday night special of 1 1/2 rack of ribs for price of one rack is a great deal, enough for both of us for dinner and lunch the next day! I really like this place as they are really glad that you are there."}
{"text":"We love the wings here.  Friendly atmosphere. A little dark inside. I don't find it family friendly v"}
{"text":"Cool bar but the food was not impressive. Ribs were over sauces, fajitas had no flavor, Bologna sandwich was too thick and needed seasoning, Mac and cheese was dry (all the cream sunk to the bottom of the tiny bowl this premium side."}
{"text":"Decent menu, decent drinks, the food has always been consistent and really good, a bit proud of those wings though over $1 each."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to come with the kids or friends and hang out in Fort Mill. The staff is super sweet and the food is always good and priced reasonably. They also have great deals for large parties.  I also like to go here for lunch when I have extra cash. There are almost always some cops or firefighters sitting down eating you can treat to lunch. The food is fast and the atmosphere is lightheated.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is great! Salads are always a favorite, the white balsamic salad dressing is to die for. My teenage son loves the wings and they always have several local beers on tap. Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"We have been in here a few times. Today we had a younger server who took our drink order, came back with the drinks to take our food order and then we didn't see him until we needed the check. The chicken was very dry and when I requested fresh chips the waiter replied that they couldn't because 'they would have to like cut up a potato' .. Enough said."}
{"text":"I love this place! The wings are FANTASTIC!! The white wines are kept at a perfect temp too. I'm quickly becoming a regular. The staff and atmosphere are great as well and they have a nice beer selection (aka not just Bud and Bud light etc) 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Used to be better but has gradually gotten worse. Male service staff have an attitude (like you're doing them a favor). Avoid the \"really frickin' hot\" wings because they aren't hot and have a nasty Indian curry flavor. The next step down \"hot\" aren't. There is hardly any sauce and therefore hardly any taste and they are not even close to being hot. The sweet potato fries used to be good in both taste and quantity but now they barely give you any and they taste store bought. We won't spend any more money there until things improve, even though we can walk there from our house. If the bartender didn't also have an attitude I'd have some beers there but it's not to be.

**Update 10-June-2010** Service has improved, male staff much nicer than previously.  Overall a good experience (except the really hot wings - sauce is weird still).  Thanks for the improvements."}
{"text":"Try their Spicy burger with ghost pepper sauce.  The sauce is amazing!  They were accommodating with a request to substitute BBQ on one of the burgers with a different sauce.   The server recommended jerk sauce which was awesome!   Good bar food with a nice twist on flavor.  A good place for a family even though it is a bar."}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for a while.  I would have said 5 stars, but I am not the biggest fan of the last menu change (it was changed a while ago).  Queso dip and gold medal sauce is awesome.  Get that gold medal on wings, boneless wings, wraps...doesn't matter.  It is great!  We have always been crazy about one of the waiters as well.  Haven't seen him around in a while, so we have now forgotten his name.  He was very very nice.  Only down side is the parking can be a pain sometimes.  Lot has tiny spaces and not enough of them."}
{"text":"Agree with Chris B...\"not what it used to be...wings are still the best this side of Buffalo, everything else used to be very good, but not last year or so...fish fry used to be my favorite, last week it was terrible, as was coleslaw"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch a football game in Fort Mill, especially if you're a Panthers or a Bills fan! They've got great service, good food options (Chicken Wrap is my favorite) and cold beer."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm ready for an update.  Regardless of old experiences I've been coming back now and then for  their great happy hour from 4PM to 6PM M-F.  I have to admit, the bar is pretty darn good and their prices are much better than your average watering hole.  

I'm still not a huge fan of the restaurant section, but I'll keep coming back for more until I feel its time to reconsider.  Food is decent, service is just so-so...unless you're at the bar. Matt and Marley rock behind the bar.  Kudos"}
{"text":"Heard this place had good food so a fee of us tried it.  In my opinion it was mediocre food, I had a burger that I asked for to be medium and they gave it to me well done.  Seemed like it was a frozen patty as well, packed together hard and tasteless.   My wife had a chicken wrap which was just ok.  It looks like a nice place to have a drink and hangout though.  The service was good though, waiter had some personality and was attentive."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 6-8 times and the food is always pretty good.  You cannot go wrong with the riblets as they are super good!  
The Hot wings are not bad either if they would cook them properly and stop bringing out ranch instead of blue cheese and leave off the celery as requested.  The only problem I have is the lazy staff.  It is not like I encounter one on occasion, it is every single time I have been in there.  The girls working out front are boring and have zero personality.  They often mess up an order that is not exactly the way the menu has it and the cooks are not much better.  
If the staff, both cooks and wait staff would take a little pride in their work, this could be a much better place and I would stop in more often and when I am there, I would leave a better tip."}
{"text":"I had the town tavern burger with fries and ranch. By far one of the better burgers I've had at a bar, and their ranch was phenomenal, had to be home-made. The burger itself had a lot of flavor. I am impressed with this visit and experience. I can see myself stopping by more often. 

Tip, dipping fries in ranch instead of ketchup is far superior taste. They nailed the ranch, well-done!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now - mixed feelings.

Unfortunately the last 2 times the staff seemed disinterested in providing any reasonable level of service.

First time they made an incredible vegetarian sandwich for the wife - enough she wanted to go back!  My burger was delicious too.  Service was great!

Second time, our meals were a little less stellar.  Service was fair. ad - and I try LOTS if cobbler (my mom could make some awesome cobblers).

Third time, meals were sub-par, service was almost non-existent."}
{"text":"I just ran out for a quick lunch to catch some NCAA games and to grab some chicken wings which were  really good and meaty.  Staff was friendly and not overbearing."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here. They got our whole order right plus we got silverware and got everything we asked for! A huge plus-they wrote on the boxes what each item was! 

I got the wings in hot garlic. It was good and flavorful. Their ranch is really good. My coworker got the chicken tenders and she liked them. She said they were huge and loved it with ranch. Both people love their salads. Can't go wrong with the BLT, that would be hard to mess up! The steak sandwich was good. Steak was very tender. 

We will definitely be ordering from here again! P.S. their sweet tea is good!"}
{"text":"Lots of sports memorabilia... Ordered the fajitas.  The menu says that it came with guacamole but when I pointed that out mine had none, they said they ran out. I would have appreciated that information when I ordered (or just sliced avocado). The chicken was cooked throughout but the peppers and onions were not sufficiently cooked and the hot pan in which the chicken was served had a ton of liquid (it was not pleasant)."}
{"text":"Great nighborhood hang out.  Think Cheers.  Friendly service and good food for a tavern.  We have made it our Tuesday night thing."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite  places to go.  Yes it is noisy and always crowed.  Has nice outside  area for smokers oellig outside air people.   Monday is bingo night.   Almost everyone plays and is a good time.  We gave tried almost everything on the menu.  My husband  favors wings and I like the French dip.  Large fresh portions.  Google beer on tap selection and my soda cup is never empty.  Bar area is always crowded with obvious  regulars which adds to the fun.  Food and service has always been great.  But it is crowded and noisy.  Like hitting the best party in town when it's in full swing.  We go about  3 or 4 times a month."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a bar. I had the fajitias and it came with a generous portion size and lots of extra toppings! Their beer is resonably priced and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Authentic and wonderful fish fry! Nice to get during lent! Their chopped salad is also wonderful. Went for the buffet once on Wednesday- quite a deal!"}
{"text":"Always have had friendly service here, both when we played Tuesday night Team Bingo (and it was busy) and when I stopped in for a Bills game (also busy).  Food is good, bathrooms and clean and they have an outdoor patio. Plus I can pay for my beer with my Bingo winnings! Can't  beat it."}
{"text":"Met the owner - Danny Holmes, very personable and awesome food !
Surf( haddock )& roast beef sandwich was awesome ! Service was fantastic !"}
{"text":"This is a great atmosphere and the food is very good. The aloha chicken sandwich is full of flavor and never disappoints. That is the best thing I've had there so far"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  I recall the portions bigger and the food being better.  The acoustics are poor as you can't hear anything.  I swear they used be be better.  Location is good but parking can be tough on game days.  Hate to be there when the wealthy wasps are watching their Giants on Sunday."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here on Monday nights for the free bingo and 50 cent wings. I have an allergy to bread so they always accommodate me and do mine grilled so I can join in on wing night! The service is always great and everyone is always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late evening dinner after golf at Springfield Golf Club. It was recommended by some locals that hang here regulalrly.

I like their wing specials. You can get either boneless or bone in wings. You have a choice of several sauces and then for small fee add fries and cole slaw.

The wings were just OK, I had the honey bbq and it wasn't anything too special. The fries were better than average.

The service was good, we had a table of seven. They serve draught Heineken which is unusual. Their sweet tea was way over sweet. 

It's not a fancy place but it seems popular with the locals. It has a strong sports oriented vibe and I expect it's the place to be when the Panthers play.
They have one special room for Panther games and many autographed game day jerseys."}
