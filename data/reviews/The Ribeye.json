{"text":"This was the best meal I have had in Champaign since the town and country restaurant closed 25 years ago. The salad bar was amazing. it reminded me of a grandma's kitchen which was always full of delicious salads..I had the chicken and shrimp combo which were cooked to perfection and both melted in your mouth. The twice baked potato was one of the Best I've had. I like that this wasn't a cookie-cutter franchise. The atmosphere was cozy and unpretentious and the waitstaff was super. My husband said his steak was the best he's had since he used to get specially hand-picked ones from his best friend who was a meat cutter. That was quite a compliment from him.  ignore the comments from others about this being an old-fashioned outdated restaurant. we thought it was perfect as do many others which you can tell by the always full parking lot."}
{"text":"I like to play a game when I am traveling for my job with the hotel staff to help me find restaurants. The game is pretty simple and it cuts all of the crap that you get from hotel staff trying to be overly friendly. 

Ask \" Where would you go tonight if cost didn't matter?\" And if that doesn't work ask \"What restaurant is your favorite?\" \"What would you get?\"

First time out of maybe a hundred i didn't get a good recommendation. 

The staff is very friendly so I gave two stars, but when I go somewhere for food I want good food. 

The quality of the steak is on par with almost expired meat from walmart. Harsh but true. I feed my dog steak once a year for his birthday and the low grade steak I get from my butcher for him is better than this. Also I am glad that I read some reviews on here before I went because they serve the steak on a frying pan that is cast iron and very, very hot. The result I ordered my steak rare expecting it to come out medium rare it was closer to medium and by the time I was finished with a 12 oz. it was going towards medium well. 

The salad bar was the only redeeming quality. It had a fairly decent selection of different salads; such as pasta salad, potato salad and so forth. The basic salad is a kind of build your own house salad with a few simple dressings and a large variety of toppings that are typical in the Midwest. (Sorry reviewer from Cali I know people from Cali and they are always disappointed by our smaller selection of vegetables offered for vegans in Midwest restaurants)

The price for a 12 oz twice baked potato (mediocre and two hot to eat because it was served on a skillet so it didn't cool down) and a sprite. 29 bucks before the tip. 

This is DEFINITELY a favorite of the locals because of all of the Illini stuff on the wall but the rest of the decor was just covered up fake wood paneling from the 70's/80's will black painted drop tile. 

In short, find somewhere else there are plenty of places to eat in Champaign/Urbana."}
{"text":"The menu is very simple. The ribeye is very thin and comes out on a hot skillet. The twice baked potato was very good. The steak was good as well."}
{"text":"Awesome old school steak house. Danica my server was very attentive and knowledgeable. Ordered a steak rare and she knew not to bring it out on a hot plate, which was the norm. Menu is limited to what they do best. Great salad bar and the twice baked potato was full of flavor. Being from the south I tried their sweet tea, big surprise of flavors and just enough sugar to make a southern boy proud. 
When in Champaign Illinois give it a try. Plenty on illini photos all around."}
{"text":"The Rib Eye is solid and unpretentious.  You come for meat, you will get meat.  If you are on a college student budget, it might be a good place to go with your parents.  Personally I like it better when I'm not picking up the bill.

The main dishes are right there in the name - different sizes of rib eye.  I'd heard great things about the salad bar, and it is pretty good.  There's a lot of x salads - pasta salad, bean salad, egg salad offerings.  The vegetables are reasonably fresh and there's a fair amount of toppings.  

Even so, this is not a good place for a vegetarian.  My girlfriend's family took us out to eat here and one of her sister's friends was a vegetarian.  She had very little luck with the menu and I think had to get the salad bar only.  

The rib-eyes are meaty and well cooked, not too overseasoned.  They come out on a hot metal plate that will continue to cook them a bit as you eat.  I have ordered rare steaks each time I've been there, and they actually brought out properly rare (chill in the middle and bright red) so I didn't mind too much.  It was moist and delicious.  The steak fries are big and crispy but just a little bland to me.  

The price does seem a bit high to me when paying, and the decor is absolutely outdated.  A lot of the popularity of this place is rooted in nostalgia, I think, but it delivers the Rib eyes it promises."}
{"text":"I understand that this is Champaign, IL and you have to keep your expectations reasonable, but the salad bar here is extremely unimpressive.  Most of what is available is pre-mixed \"salads\" covered in mayo or sour cream.  The selection of fresh, undressed vegetables was limited to iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers,  carrots, and cucumbers.  Ruby Tuesday has more variety for a better price and is FAR more comfortable.

The ribeye was good but pricy.  It was served on a hot skillet, which helped keep it warm while I got my potato prepared.

The ambiance was awful with narrow, hard chairs, too much sports memorabilia, and too crowded (my wife was hit several times by staff and other customers).

Our waitress was extremely attentive without hovering or getting talkative.  Very happy with the service.

Overall, not bad, but slightly overpriced, and keep your expectations reasonable."}
{"text":"Great on all counts except the decor could really use updating.  Tradition or not, I know people who refuse to go based on the decor.  The food is awesome though."}
{"text":"After much anticipation having heard about this place for years, I was disappointed. Evidently, many people have not experienced an excellent steak or they prefer their's bland. If your name is The Ribeye, you should have flavorful ribeyes. I used steak sauce so I could taste something. I can at least say my steak was cooked properly and the service was good."}
{"text":"This is a place you only go to for one reason - steak.  That said, it's pretty good, and the salad bar is quite good.  Expect throngs of locals, esp. around athletic event times.  The place is full of Illini regalia and probably hasn't been updated decor-wise since the 70's.  Sadly, most of their constituency wouldn't care or notice."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews of The Ribeye, I decided I would like to try this place. I was surprised that the restaurant was only open 5 and half hours every day and close by 9 or 9:30 every night. Weird concept for me... they would definitely receive more business by staying open a little later. 
We did not make a reservation and walked in. Quoting us a 20-25 minute wait while there were four open tables to be seen we decided to wait and eat here. Seeing we were not leaving, the hostess seated us within 8 minutes. This was a Friday evening.
Our waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us. We ordered a beer on tap and of course, the ribeye. Ribeye comes with choice of baked potato, steak fries, or rice and each couple gets a loaf of bread. Salad bar is free if you order an entree. The salad bar was great, but way too small. It had plenty of food but it was crowded with a lot of people on both sides reaching everywhere. It needs a different spot in the restaurant. 
I ordered the 8 oz. ribeye while my husband ordered the 12 oz. It was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good. I expected my mind to be blown, but it was just a good cut of steak. 
With two steaks and two beers our bill was $55. 

The restaurant looks like something from the 70s... very odd, but comforting in a way."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh, my steak was undercooked, but just a tad, so I was still happy.  However, our waitress would have known if she did a food checkback, or any checkback.  My bar drink was wrong,  and she fixed it, but no apology. Not sure I ever heard a thank you from her.  Because I am a waiter myself, I still have her 20%, but they will not get my business again.  Also, I ordered the 10oz ribeye, and it was very thin and, well,  I doubt 10oz before cooking.  Maybe 8 oz."}
{"text":"An excellent Manhattan to start the evening. Terrific service, great salad bar then prime rib and baked potato. Simple and perfect. Oh and carrot cake to go which was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Ahh, The Ribeye, a University of Illinois post game tradition.  I am assuming it is a post game tradition because most people have imbibed before, during, and after the game and need the Ribeye's bland food to stay in their stomachs.  I am only halfway joking.  
     My SO and I went to the Ribeye recently on a Saturday night and true to course, it was packed.  Even with the full house we did not have a long wait.  The clientele was a mixture of older couples and slightly depressed game goers.  The interior of the Ribeye is straight up old school steak house, dark and dated. 
    Like prior reviewers have noted, the Ribeye is famous (or infamous) for its very small menu: ribeye steaks, chicken, and shrimp.   They charge you $1.50 per ounce after $23.99 for a 10 ounce ribeye so it makes it just a little more expensive than going to a chain steakhouse restaurant.  They do have a salad bar that is included with your dinner.  It is not a huge salad bar and only has the basics for salad toppings.  It's meh ... I was impressed to see spiced apple rings on it though.  I had not seen those things since the grade school cafeteria!
     The server we had was very friendly although she was busy and did not offer a refill or any suggestions to go with the meal.  I will chalk it up to being busy although she did take time to chat up the U of I game goers at the next table.
    I ordered a 8 oz. ribeye rare with sautéed mushrooms and loaded baked potato.  SO ordered the 10 oz. ribeye medium rare with steak fries.   It did not take long for the entrees to arrive on sizzling hot on plates like a fajita.  The sautéed mushrooms were canned button mushrooms in a weird wine sauce and swimming in oil.  They were not bad, but they were not sautéed.  My steak was medium rare but it's hard to cook a steak-umm rare.  Seriously, my steak looked like it belonged on a Philly cheesesteak. I did not mind the fat but the lack of any type of seasoning was ridiculous (salt & pepper should be requisite seasonings!).  If you want to be known as THE steakhouse for the Champaign-Urbana area, maybe you should invest in some quality steaks and not truck stop steaks. My husband enjoyed his steak but he had just recovered from the stomach flu so I am not sure his experience is valid.  SO's steak fries were okay, again no seasoning and my baked potato was a baked potato. Sour cream is fully loaded here and you have to ask if you want extra butter other than the one that comes with the tableside bread.   Disappointed in general and completely confused as to how people consider this a great steakhouse. 

Pros:   Nice service, kind of cool retro atmosphere
Cons:  Bland over priced food, over inflated reputation"}
{"text":"As a big fan of the Ribeye, I have one piece of advice - if you plan to go on a Friday night, or after any Illini basketball, football, volleyball, or other popular sport game, make sure to call in reservations before you go. I've had 15 minute waits even with a reservation, and 45 minutes plus without. I don't believe they take any reservations on Saturday, so expect a wait.
 
Ambiance/decor isn't the best, sure, but it serves its purpose. The clientele is comprised largely of older Illini fans, so it works for the Ribeye to have pictures of Illini teams from their glory days. 

The service here is fantastic. The servers are professional, polite, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. 

About the food... Well, when you go to a place called \"The Ribeye,\" you should probably be in the market for a ribeye. Sure, there's chicken and shrimp, but the ribeye is their pièce de résistance. Honestly, when I started going to the Ribeye around 5 years ago, I feel like the steaks used to be higher quality, which is what keeps me from giving them a 5. Still, the ribeye is brought out on a hot cast-iron skillet/plate, and that sizzle alone can make my mouth water. I recommend either ordering one degree of cooking lower than your normal preference (i.e., if you like medium-rare steaks, order rare) to compensate, or eat your steak as soon as it's served. The highlight for me, however, is the salad bar. There's iceburg lettuce and the standard salad toppings to make your own,  or an array of pasta, bean and potato salads (most of which are, indeed, covered in mayonnaise). My personal favorite is comprised of green peas, peanuts, cheddar cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. Is it haute cuisine? No. But it is solid, simple, and delicious. Also awesome - the croutons, made from the leftovers from the fresh French or wheat bread brought to your table.

The price isn't terrible. Two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $42. The Ribeye isn't world-class, five-star dining, but it does offer good steaks, great salad options, and pleasant service."}
{"text":"I myself can't recommend Ribeye for a meal, and gave it a low rating, roughly 1 1/2 stars. Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.

Ambience and Decor:
Let me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. 


Food:
The food at Ribeye is not to my taste. 

The ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.

The salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.

Bread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. 

The vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to order.

I can't comment on dessert. None of us ordered dessert, and I don't remember what was on the dessert menu.


Summary:
Overall, Ribeye leaves me with the impression of being an upgraded (albeit, a much upgraded) version of Sizzler. It also has the feel of a sports bar. Prices are pretty much in line with what Ribeye offers. That is, prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values. Service is adequate but unremarkable either way.

For me, this all is about 1 1/2 stars on Yelp. Ribeye is targeted to, and evidently, successfully fills, its own niche in the market. The other reviewers have different opinions, but all of us are evaluating the product that I have tried to describe to you above, in my review. I hope this will give you some idea of what to expect if you visit Ribeye."}
{"text":"I will concur with the other reviewers that the decor is completely drab and dull however, I really enjoyed my meal last night. We arrived around 4:15. Noticed there were quite a few people already there. We were told they would let us have a table as long as we could eat and be done by 6:00. That not being a problem we were promptly seated. My daughter and I usually share a meal and I asked our server if that would be OK. She told me that the kids buffet was only $3.00 so we opted for that. And she certainly ate her worth of $3.00 salad bar and more. 

When will it stop snowing here????? Anyway, I ordered the 10 oz. Ribeye medium. When it came out on the sizzling skillet it was more like well done. It was hard to cut and totally dried out. My server noticed that I wasn't happy and offered to get another one. I am not one of those people who likes to send food back to the kitchen for obvious reasons but this time I did. She brought me back that best Ribeye I have had in a very long time. When I cut into it bleed and that grosses me out but here the skillet is still cooking the steak and therefore it was soon medium and perfect!! So, my advice would be to order your steak under what you would at other steakhouses. 

They make the ranch dressing and that is always a plus in my book. The salad bar was good. They have real bacon bits. That along with homemade ranch dressing is the best in my book!! 

By the time we left there were so many people waiting to get a table it was crazy.  I advise go early (they open at 4:00) or make reservations.

Yes, they only offer Ribeye steaks. No deceiving there. Hence their name,"}
{"text":"The steaks are fine, but I love the twice baked potatoes and the salad bar is legit. It's not terribly budget-friendly, though, so we don't make it here very often."}
{"text":"My fiancee and her family have been going to this place for years.  It's pretty simple all around -- they have a simple menu and a rockstar salad bar (whatever that means...their salad bar is A+).  The service is always excellent and the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The steak is cooked nicely but under seasoned as were the sauté onions I had to go with the meat.  Our waiter raved about how great the twice baked potatoes were but I'd have to disagree.  Maybe I don't have a taste for them in general but it tasted bland and very average.  Plus the peal at the bottom was rock hard so I could eat it.  Salad bar was pretty good and I enjoyed what they had to offer there but overall I thought that paying $30 for this and a single beer was a bit much for what I got.  

Our waiter did a great job and I kinda like the nostalgic feel of the decor even though I'm not really an Illini fan.  Don't plan to visit again unless someone else is buying."}
{"text":"My family has been going to the RIbeye for over 20 years.  Their steak is WONDERFUL, the all-you-can-eat salad bar is beyond this world, and the twice baked potato is the best I've ever had.  The staff is professional and very knowledgeable and helpful.  Would highly recommed the Ribeye for a classy, Illini-themed restaurant any day."}
{"text":"worst. steak. ever.

Why oh why can't we rate zero stars?!  Or better still, negative stars!

Update: Had to go again because my aunt is insane. Knowing how bad the steak is, I ordered the shrimp. 10 times worse than the steak. The salad bar that people rave about? Laughably bad. Seriously, have you never been outside of Champaign and seen a real salad bar?  Hell, even the Courier Cafe in Urbana has a better salad bar!

Our waitress--and I wish I could remember her name-- was excellent, but she couldn't save the meal.

DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"Menu choices are simple steak, chicken or shrimp. All are good, but I get the chicken which is delivered sizzling on a cast iron skillet with a delicious sweet and tangy sauce. The salad bar has many \"salads\" and cottage cheese in addition to crisp lettuce. Servers are friendly and prompt. Would give 5*, but the dining room is in need of remodeling/updating."}
{"text":"The salad bar is nice.  If you have ever walked by a grocery store deli and thought \"I'd like to taste all these pasta salads\" then you'd probably really like it.  That's the only reason I gave this place more than 1 star.

The steak was a big disappointment.  My favorite cut of steak is the ribeye.  A proper ribeye has an \"eye\" (longissimus dorsi) and a \"cap\" (spinalis) separated by a piece of fat.  The steak I received was an extremely lean piece of beef, indistinguishable from a lean sirloin--no cap, no fat, and no flavor.  It was barely one step above what you would get at a 24-hour diner.  In addition to being incompetently butchered, the steak was also completely unsalted and unseasoned.  The cook literally just took a raw piece of beef (sirloin?) and threw it directly onto the grill.  What the hell?  Even a beginner knows you have to season meat *before* you cook it to get the best flavor.  Adding salt and pepper at the table is a distant second.  To be accurate, the steak was cooked pretty much to the level of doneness I asked (I ordered rare, it came medium rare; close enough).  But with no detectable beef flavor, this was cold comfort.

We also got the shrimp, and that also was a disappointment.  It was stiff and rubbery.  I've had better shrimp at a buffet.

The personalized loaf of bread sounded like a nice idea, but in practice the bread was dry.  It really wasn't any better than the boring roll you would get at any other restaurant.

The prices are high.  One 8 oz. steak and one steak & shrimp (no drinks) cost us over $50.  We could have gone to the diner down the street and gotten an equivalent meal for less than half that amount.  I would gladly pay more than $50 for two actual ribeyes of half-decent quality.  This wasn't it.

Read the Yelp reviews of this place with a critical eye.  When people praise it to the sky because \"they were nice to my grandma\" and \"I grew up and/or went to college here and it makes me nostalgic\", instead of giving an honest appraisal of the food, there's a reason.

If you are interested in getting a good ribeye (or indeed anything tasty besides salad), The Ribeye is unfortunately not the place to eat."}
{"text":"Fair is stretching it.  The ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut.  Not on my list to revisit in the future!"}
{"text":"Ok, salad bar was good, from what I understand all salads & dressings are homemade.  I believe it, very tasty!!!  The steak however....very disappointing!!   Not much flavor, and not a high quality meat.  Would compare this is The Sizzler.  Overpriced for the quality.  Would go back only for the salad bar.  For a good steak...go to Long Horn Steak House, or Ruth's Chris Steak House"}
{"text":"I was impressed.  We had the ribeye, shrimp and chicken entrees.  All were very good.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere-This place needs a serious facelift. It's trapped in 1984. Even the photos of the new Illinois staff on the walls were made to look old! The tables aren't actually tables. They are pieces of plywood with a tablecloth covering them. Old dingy Tiffany style light fixtures and everything is maroon. Reminds me of my great grandparents. Even the old people say it needs an update. Come on now. 

Food-They have the absolute very best salad bar in the area. Everything is fresh and delicious. That being said, they only have 3 items in their menu. Steak, chicken, and shrimp which is fine IF (big if) they do all 3 items exceptionally. But they don't. I come here fairly regularly for the salad bar. Sometimes we get their Sunday/Monday steak special (which is a fantastic deal) Every time we order our steak medium. Every time we get something other than medium. Went 2 weeks in a row. Once got a steak that was rare, almost blue. Next week got medium well/well. I brought it to the attention of a manager one time on a Sunday and he told me the cooks on Sunday's aren't as good as the other days and offered us a discount. Um, what?!? Who says that??? Either way, the salad bar is delicious and the Sunday/Monday steak special is good so I guess I'll be back. At least I know what to expect."}
{"text":"My grandparents are long-time fans of the Ribeye, and I have joined them at the Ribeye on two separate occasions.  Both times, the hostesses and the servers were extremely nice to them - treating them like local celebrities - and anyone who is that nice to my grandparents is okay with me! 

The Ribeye has a relatively limited menu and their specialty is the ribeye (surprise, surprise).  The salad bar and baked potato are included with the ribeye dinner, and both are pretty good.  The overall ambiance of the Ribeye is relatively casual, and they have a lot of Fighting Illini memorabilia.  I think some of the reviewers who were disappointed with this place may have been expecting something along the lines of Morton's or Gibson's in Chicago - the Ribeye is not that."}
{"text":"We were in town for graduation and were hoping to find someplace we could get into without a huge wait.  We only had a brief wait for our party of 6 and the food and service were really excellent.  The menu is limited but if you want a ribeye, don't pas up this place."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is out of this world.Yes the salad bar is , good everything is good. 
The fresh bread you get there is out of this world too. 
The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait if you don't make it there on time when they open,  the lines are so long.
But I guess it is worth it. 
I normal don't eat steak but that steak and the chicken is  good.
I also have a glass of wine with my dinner that is very delicious."}
{"text":"I have been in Champaign for school for the past 2 1/2 years and during that time people have recommended the Ribeye, but I never was able to try it.  I'm finishing up my last week here and we decided to try this place tonight.

I will get to the point.  It was crowded on a Thursday night (mostly with elderly individuals over 60),   Being crowded on a weeknight is usually a good sign.

The other goods.  They offer a pretty decent salad bar and their ice cream alcoholic drinks are good.

The Bad:  The food lacks seasoning.  The waitress admitted that they don't season the fries and steered us away from them.  This didn't bother me as I had no interest in fries.  I ordered the Ribeye, which I was also shocked that they don't season at all.  I'm talking zero seasoning, not even a pinch of salt or pepper.  I assume this is because of the elderly clientele that surrounded us.  I find this unacceptable.  I could have at least been warned that they don't season the steak and asked if I want it seasoned.

This place was a disappointment and is not worth trying.  I imagine it will be out of business in 10 years when their clientele unfortunately pass away."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to town and ask my parents where I can take them out to eat, they choose the Ribeye. Otherwise, I would never go here.
When you walk in, The dated paneling, low ceilings, and sports bar lighting/TVs might make you think you were in a pizza joint or sports bar instead of a steak restaurant. The place is dark and windowless with (rather tacky) Illini sports posters on every wall/surface.
The salad bar, which some people rave about, is not particularly large and is poorly designed/located so that you often have to go down both sides to get what you want...which is a lot of trouble considering the offerings.
The steaks are OK, but thin for the price and always overcooked. The shrimp is OK, too. The bread, which looks/feels fresh baked tastes like its stale and probably comes from frozen dough.
The only nice thing I can say about the place is that my parents like it."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly outstanding about this establishment. Came here because it was close to my hotel. Steak was below average and service was lacking. I would not return."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What has happened to this once great steakhouse? Firstly...Dee was a wonderful server, friendly, helpful, and efficient. Buck was a great host. The salad bar was 5 star, but the balance of the meal....well that's what you come for, was poor. Steaks not good, my wife ordered hers medium well it was red. Our server took it back but it was poor. Mine was cooked correctly but no flavor and not worth $24.95....the twice baked potato was also poor, tasted like it was frozen and baked or microwaved to warm it. We won't return unless forced to. Don't know what has happened but things are moving backwards very quickly."}
{"text":"Whenever you ask someone about The Ribeye, their response is the same:  \"the salad bar their is FABULOUS.\"

When the best thing going for a steakhouse is its salad bar, this should be a red flag.

The service is stiff and hurried, but efficient.  The wine list is basically two choices:  white or red.  The menu is basically two choices:  steak or chicken.

The steak is a decent cut, but hardly seasoned and served on hot cast-iron skillets that mean your medium-rare steak is well by the end of your meal (and your medium well is a dried-out hockey puck of jerky-like ribeye.)

All this while dining in a windowless cinder-block building decorated wholly in orange and blue, and surrounded by senior citizens (equally decorated wholly in orange and blue.)

But yes, the salad bar is good."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The salad bar was fresh and excellent. The variety of salads was great. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. Our waiter was Brian and gave us excellent service. This is not a chain style steak house and  is a local favorite restaurant in the Champaign area. The restaurant was cozy and quiet. Very relaxing and the meal was wonderful. Enjoy...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Champaign to get a steak, hands down. I have ate here probably 30 times and never had a bad experience. The salad bar here is beyond amazing. Food and serve is also excellent. PS ~ Brian is the best waiter. He always remembers us and is super personable."}
{"text":"The salad bar was excellent. They had a delicious assortment of salads and pasta and even some fruit. I had the chicken and shrimp meal and it was also delicious. My sister has a gluten intolerance and was able to order the chicken without the marinade. This is definitely a special occasion restaurant due to it's steep prices though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great local spot with very good food.  The portions are plentiful and the salad bar had so much to choose from other than salad toppings.  Ill definitely go again."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow...our waiter Jamie was spread thin when we first arrived but stayed at his own slow pace. The food did come out very hot and delicious. Will try again..."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the \"Touchdown Club\" from the old TV show Coach. Very 80s feel, very nostalgic, and pretty good steak too!  The real star is the salad bar, a nice touch before getting the staple meat and potato."}
{"text":"Still a pretty good one steak steakhouse but not what it once was.  If you want a great salad bar then this is the place to be. The cuts of steak need to be a bit more flavorful though. The decor is dated and dingy. Definitely would benefit from an update. Service is always reliable here."}
{"text":"The Ribeye is the best place for steak. The salad bar is awesome and can't be beat. I have never had a bad meal or left the place hungry."}
{"text":"The food was Amazing 16oz Steak and fries steak was so big and juicy I couldn't finish it so I brought the leftover home for my Dog Roxy. I'm sure she will love it as well as I Did"}
{"text":"To refute what others have said, I do not think that this place is superior to Beef House in Indiana. That being said, this is probably the best place you can get a steak in the entire county! Salad bar had a ton of different options and the give you a ridiculous amount of bread. I really enjoyed the steak and shrimp (which were huge!) Also really like the fact that everything comes out on a sizzling hot plate. Be sure to go in hungry - you certainly won't leave that way!"}
{"text":"Great service! I only had the salad bar when I went but it was still great! They have so many options on their salad bar. By far on the the best in Champaign. The others I was with enjoy their meals and would recommend going back!"}
{"text":"Okay so I dont get the draw to this place- the decor is right out the 80 ' s and the clientele is in their 60' and 70's. The food is one step above a sizzler and the prices are that of medium to upscale restaurant. Over time I've began to realize that some people don't know what good food is...now without calling me an A-hole, hear me out. Everything is bland and unseasoned here; steaks are traditionally brought out with the texture of shoe leather, God forbid there be any juice left in the steak. Salad bar is eh, it's big and if big means good then I guess it's great. As one person posted before it will probably be gone in 10-15 years when a majority of their patrons have passed away, though I would like to say they are probably right, there is a new crop right around the corner that will still view the ribeye as a special treat. You don't have to reinvent the wheel but for Petes sake if you are going to specialize in steak serve a great steak (I'm looking at you, Beef House, as well). Eat what you like, I'm not going to stop you, but if you are seeking out a decent steak in Champaign the best place I can suggest is Roadhouse and I'm ashamed to do so-"}
{"text":"The decor seems like it's stuck in the 80's or 90's.. the service is decent.  

I am not actually a huge fan of the ribeye steaks.  They put them on this hot plate so even if you order a steak that is rare.. it comes out medium rare.  I kind of wish they offered some other cuts of beef.  I think they do offer breaded fried shrimp if you don't want ribeye.

I do think their salad bar ROCKS.  It's really clean and have interesting salads there (as well as build your own).  Plus, all their veggies are defrosted properly.  I hate going to a salad bar and seeing the peas clumped together like an ice cube."}
{"text":"The 80's belonged to the Illini and the Ribeye belongs to the 80's. This is one of those traditional joints that dot Champaign-Urbana that has a homey, comfortable feel to it, like an old leather chair. The dark decor hasn't changed in thirty years with its mirrored wall tiles and Tiffany lamps in orange and blue adorning the dining room. 

Don't expect an experience like you'd get at Morton's or the Capital Grille or Smith and Wollensky's. Bone marrow truffles or creamed spinach will not be found on the menu. What you will get though is a hearty meal delivered with friendly, attentive service. 

You need to be hungry for beef though as that's what the Ribeye offers best from its kitchen. Ribeye steaks are ordered by the ounce in two-ounce increments starting at 8 ounces and heading up to 2 lbs. Your meal will be cooked in special broilers to take advantage of the Maillard reaction that occurs in this environment. That's how steakhouses get the unique flavors that form when proteins and sugars react deliciously under high heat conditions. There are a few other choices on the menu if you're not a carnivore but you're missing half the fun if you don't pick the beef. Your steak arrives sizzling hot atop a heated cast-iron skillet along with your choice of potato or other starch.

While waiting for your main course, you'll receive a loaf of freshly baked bread at your table, and you'll be invited to partake in the very well-stocked salad bar. This has to be one of the best bars anywhere. You can assemble a nice dinner salad with a variety of greens and condiments such as pepperoncini or pickled beets, as well as sample the home-made carrot-raisin salad, Spanish rice, and several other regular, tasty creations. You'll have to take care not to fill up on these although you may be tempted to do so. The salad bar is a major part of the whole home-cooked vibe this restaurant puts forward.

Brian is my favorite server as he always takes good care of his guests, but I've never had a bad service experience in all the years I've visited. It's not a flashy place like your typical modern steakhouses but the food is excellent at a reasonable price. Recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't know what the deal is with the reviews of this restaurant but I was in Champaign on business for a day and stayed at a nearby hotel and was referred to try the Ribeye because of its local flare. I have eaten at top rated (over priced) steakhouses and I was in the mood for some good midwest beef and something on the 'local' side. I had a GREAT dinner experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place, the U of I memorabillia is very cool (I am a sports fan) and it has a nice feel to it. The service was more than attentive. Had a really nice glass of wine. Ordered the Ribeye dinner, medium rare and it came with bread, salad bar and baked potato. All for under $20, food only. I travel, try to get this anywhere - you won't find it. The salad bar is nice, for me not that big of a deal. The little loaf of bread is a nice touch. But when the steak and potato arrived on a sizzling hot plate, oh yeah this is what I wanted after traveling all day. I ordered the steak medium rare and I will have to say that it was cooked to PERFECTION. Just the way I wanted it. The potato was tasty and large and I just sat back and enjoyed a very nice meal. 

I would definitely eat here again, I would recommend others to do the same."}
{"text":"Don't know how to give 1-2 stars or I would downgrade the rating. 
If you're gonna name yourself after a cut of meat, I believe the meat shouldn't be substandard. Ribeye is my favorite steak but this did not cut it. 
Added sautéed onions and mushrooms to the meal and to my surprise they were button mushrooms. 
The small loaves of bread were hot coming to the table.  I had one slice - average. 
The best thing going on was the salad bar and even it lacked. By that I mean the lettuce was tired. However a good variety of other things were there. 
Large portions - that's the best I can say. And that it was walking distance from the hotel. 
But if it's meh, who cares?"}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly, the salad bar is fresh and the plates are kept cold. And the steak is amazing and full of flavor. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I really don't get some of the reviews of this place.  The salad bar is fabulous?  Ok, you people need to get out of central Illinois more....

So here's what this place is about.  It is called The Ribeye and that is a perfect name for it.  Just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye.  You can get an 8 oz ribeye, a 10 oz ribeye or a custom cut ribeye in any weight up to 32 ounces.  But you can't get any other cut of meat.  All ribeyes all the time.  They do have I think one chicken and one shrimp dish available if you don't like ribeyes.  So you better like ribeyes if you come to this place.

Now to the salad bar.  What is good about it?  The fact that they have iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, croutons and 8 different mayonaisse based salads?  The salad bar is terrible.  Where are the mixed greens or spinach?  What about garbanzo beans or sprouts or candied walnuts or jicama or edamame or anything remotely interesting?  I find rural midwest cuisine sorely lacking in variety and this salad bar is just about as vanilla as it gets.

Lack of menu choices, a terrible salad bar, baked potatoes that only come with butter and sour cream options (a steak restaurant should ALWAYS have baked potatoes that come with the options of chives, bacon, cheese and ALL of the fixings) and a pretty dingy interior all leave you pretty underwhelmed with this place.  Unless you want a 32 ounce ribeye.  Then they've got you covered!"}
{"text":"The price is increased but the steak size is reduced. Disappointed."}
{"text":"As a townie, I've been eating here on special occasions for years. Last night I went there with my sister, parents, and nine-year-old son, and dinner for all of us was  over $80! Our chicken skillets were $16.99 each - much more expensive than it used to be, and the portions are smaller!   Not only that, but my sons steak had a lot of fat on it.  Our waitress, Dee, was wonderful, but the experience wasn't worth it for the price."}
{"text":"If you understand what the Ribeye is and go in there with the right mindset, you will not be disappointed. 

I grew up (and never really left) C-U, so the Ribeye will always hold a special place in my heart for its sentimental value. The decor hasn't changed in 20+ years, I'm sure. When you go in there, you feel like you are transported back to the 80s. However, the restaurant itself is very clean. 

The salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh, crisp and cold. I can't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads. All of their salads and salad dressings, to my knowledge, are made in-house. I'm a huge fan of everything on that salad bar, especially the cucumber salad and the herring salad (but you just might have to be Eastern European to appreciate pickled herring with onions in mayo). 

For being a Ribeye lover, I actually don't like the steaks at the Ribeye. I really like thick-cut steaks cooked med rare, and you will never get anything below a med well steak at this place. However, the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor. They're served on a hot skillet (which I find questionable, but again, it's part of the experience). I always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce. It's seriously the best out there. 

I don't like twice-baked potatoes anyways, and their's is no exception. I usually order steak fries or rice pilaf.

They have drinks, but they appeal more to the older crowd. No biggie for me, I usually order iced tea or wine anyways.

I wouldn't say any food from the Ribeye is out of this world, but it is very, very good. The quality of the food and service is consistent. Go in with an open-mind. The Ribeye hasn't changed a bit in decades, and there's always a wait -- there's definitely a reason why they haven't changed. They do what they do very well."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea but older people like it. Admittedly been years since ate there but not much seasoning on steak. Salad bar was good."}
{"text":"Excellent local landmark restaurant. Love the salad bar! A modest but flavorful wine selection is available. I got the 10oz ribeye and it was a perfect medium rare. Service was good no real complaints there. If I had to say something negative it would be that there are way too many old people here!"}
{"text":"A very popular place in Champaign.  The steaks are always done as you request, the salad bar is a nice size with good selection, the beer selection is very limited if your not a 'light' fan.  Service has always been good, an extra treat for anniversaries & birthdays is a plus.  Since all I can say is good things,  why just 3 stars you ask?  Well, since you asked, I'll tell you:  I have never come out of 'The Ribeye' and said to myself, \"I just can't wait till I come back here\""}
{"text":"This place is fine.  Despite those negative reports, we tried it.   We both liked the salad bar,  and our steaks were ok.   Definitely not Morton's or Ruths Chris, but it was priced fair and the service was good."}
{"text":"While the service was very good, I can not say the same for the food. An 8 oz ribeye is only about 3/8th inch thick. Asked for medium rare and got mostly medium. Steak was bland and without any flavor. Had mushrooms with it and for the price I would have expected Portabella mushrooms instead of canned button mushrooms. Again not much flavor. Overall, this is not a return to restaurant for me."}
{"text":"was sadly disappointed.

My medium rare steak was overdone, and hard to cut, but maybe its just the rib-eye cut? sadly no other steak cut options.

The pickled beets and freashly baked slight deepfried bread are awesome.  Other than that, I just wasn't really feeling the pasta and buckets of mayo salad bar.

The decor is more than slightly dungeony from the moment you walk in.

Menu options is basically rib eye and some insignificant chicken option and 3 pieces of shrimp for 20 bucks.

However, the place was busy the whole evening, so they must be doing something right for others."}
{"text":"Best place in town!!!! Been eating steak there for 20years. Can't beat the all you can eat salad bar. My steak is always perfect and they actually know how to cook it rare. I don't understand why people are so hung up on the decorations."}
{"text":"Every now and then, you find a restaurant that does one thing and they do it so well that they never need to change. This is not that kind of place, although it thinks it is. The menu offers three options: ribeye, chicken, or shrimp. Seeing as they specialize in ribeyes, I would think they would know how to cook one. I ordered mine medium, expecting a juicy, pink center. I ended up with a very well done steak that was mostly devoid of flavor. Part of the problem is due to the fact that the steaks are served on a hot skillet-plate, which obviously continues to cook the steak as it comes out to you. If you plan on ordering a steak here, I recommend asking for it rare so that by the time it arrives at the table, it's not completely over-cooked.

I understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people. There is a huge selections of different \"salads\" that you might find at a church potluck (i.e., all sorts of salads that involves pasta, mayo, and other things that are not lettuce). If you want a lettuce salad, there is a large bowl of crisp iceberg with tomato slices carefully arranged in a cylinder, stacked like citrusy bricks. 

I imagine the baked potato is fine, because you can't really do a whole lot to mess it up. I ordered the steak fries, which weren't seasoned at all. One of my dinner companions commented that they tasted a lot like the frozen french fries that you bake in your oven at home. 

The decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices. From the look of the place, you'd think you were at a small town seniors restaurant that served plain chicken with a side of canned corn. Then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $16-23. It didn't bother me a lot, but it was amusingly awful in terms of ambience.

I don't mean to trash this place too much though. The service was great, and the staff were very accommodating. I was there for a graduation party, and I called in advance to see if they would allow me to bring in cupcakes. I've seen other Champaign-Urbana restaurants add a plating charge for any outside food, if they allow it at all. The Ribeye said it was no problem. I have to give them props for being cool about everything.

Overall, I can't really recommend this. You can get a mediocre steak for a lot less. If you do end up going, just make sure you either order the steak less done that you want it, or be very clear with the waitress as to what medium or medium rare means to you (and be prepared to send it back). Oh, and don't order the fries!"}
{"text":"It was what I expected, a place that claims to be a ribeye place.  What I didn't expect was a thin cut of ribeye.  I'm  used to a thick narrow cut of beef.  It was prepared exactly as I ordered but there wasn't much flavor.  

On the other hand, the salad bar was very good with a large selection.  Service was good and its walking distance from the hotel."}
{"text":"I love that the menu is limited...  Makes the decision process easier!  Our steak was VERY good, cooked exactly as we ordered it, medium rare.  The salad bar was good too.  Not as great as the one at the Mascoutah Moose's once a month Steak Saturday, but good.  Our server, Ashleigh, was attentive and personable.  All in all, well worth the money."}
{"text":"For all the hype about this place I was seriously disappointed.  The 10 oz ribeye was bland as could be.  I have had better ribeyes from Walmart. The waitress wasn't very attentive  and when she asked how the food was,  seeing 75% of it still on my plate and after I told her I was bland  the waitress said \"um well ok do you like want it to go then\"  I told her no thank you. She comes back a minute later and says well I told my manager and she said it looks like you ate about 6 ounces of it so we can give you a 3 oz piece as a replacement. Who in  the hell would want that.  We didn't ask for a discount so why would I want a small chunk of meat. So if you like plain steak with no flavor this is the place for you. Salad bar was decent and that  is the only reason this place is getting 2 stars. 

Side note when paying your bill make sure you ask for a recipt because they just take your credit card  and give you the wrong receipt back."}
