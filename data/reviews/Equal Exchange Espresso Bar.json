{"text":"This is a really great spot inside of Heinens downtown. I stopped here today and tried the Dirty Chai unsweetened with soy milk and it was great. As it usually does come sweetened, the barista who prepared it has me try it first to see if I liked it, the expectation being that she would adjust the drink if I didn't. Really nice service and, in my opinion, higher quality than mass-produced Starbucks. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Equal Exchange Espresso Bar is still great, still a hidden gem, and still a place with great coffee. Madison S and I stopped in for a coffee today and enjoyed the place to ourselves. It had been a while since I adventured here, but alas, nestled in a nook and cranny in the beautiful Heinen's still lays this coffee shop.

I had a great Dirty Chai and Madison enjoyed her Iced Latte. I adored their new little chalk sign with their spring specials, which someone put a lot of time into (both the handwriting AND the drink ideas). The Dandelion Fluff Tea Latte looked amazing - chamomile tea, vanilla and steamed milk - totally trying that the next time I come.

If you're looking for a traditional coffee shop, just know this isn't it. There's some tables/chairs in the circular lobby-ish area of the first floor, but that area gets suuupppeerrr crowded and noisy. Tip: instead, get your coffee from Equal Exchange than take the elevator to the 2nd floor. Sit at the tables/chairs near the wine section and enjoy the beautiful Rotunda views!"}
{"text":"Adorableness through the roof.

Beyond the friendly baristas, this teeny coffee counter of sorts packs a caffeinated punch. Lauren K and I ambled over here to grab a post-Heinen's London Fog.

Kathy, the barista that day, was so friendly and chatty I wished I could've pulled up a chair. But alas it's counter only and we were on the run and enjoyed our teas on the go.

The menu is pretty deep considering the size of the actual space and there are plenty of drink and snacky options available. The pastries looked pretty on point too.

All that being said, don't overlook this sweet and affordable coffee stop."}
