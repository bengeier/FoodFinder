{"text":"Lots of open tables and won't seat people.  Once seated, Unbelievably slow at getting the food out.  Asked them 3 times to change a tv to another game and they didn't"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago to visit my brother in Champaign, we decided to try out The HUB and had a great experience! Not only did we have an entertaining night with many people while we watched a Cubs game, but their Spicy Sriracha Burger left my mouth watering! The HUB is considered a fairly new restaurant, but I would highly recommend as a great location to enjoy delicious food in an entertaining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely awesome! And great prices too.  The BBQ chicken flat bread was great. The Hub Mac and cheese was very rich but definitely worth the calories. My husband really enjoyed his Siracha Burger. Great chic place in Champaign. B-I-G screen tv is great to watch games. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with coworkers- seated right away, easy enough.  I asked our server to help me decide between a flat bread pizza and something else.  He quickly recommended one of their cheese flatbreads so I ordered it.  It came out last and he gave it to me quickly and hurried away.  I noticed right away it was well done (burnt) and not too appealing.  I took a bite to be sure, but it was gross.  Our server never came back until the end of the meal when everyone I was with was finished.  I told him my food was inedible and kinda gross.  He looked at it, checked the burnt bottom, agreed that it was burnt and was basically like, \"Yeah, that looks pretty bad.\"  I then asked why he would bring out food that looked like that if he agreed with me?!? He kinda laughed and didn't really have an answer.  I asked if that was how it was supposed to look and he admitted no, it wasn't, and finally offered to make me a new one.  Not much help when everyone else at the table is ready for a check.   To add the icing to the cake, he charged me for it!  I held up my bill and asked why, and he just shrugged and said, \"I asked if you wanted a new one, didn't I?\" Yeah....the rest of the group agreed that the food was mediocre and after that, none of us will be back."}
{"text":"If I had to choose between eating here or getting a prostate exam performed by Edward Scissorhands I'd choose the latter. By the time we got our food the dinosaurs came back and then went BACK into extinction!!! When we did finally get our food, we got the wrong burrito order and then had to wait the same amount of time for them to correct the problem without really getting an update on if the issue was being fixed. This is not the place to come if you are truly hungry because they are not quick or have organized service (although our waiter was very kind). Disappointing to say the least"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was fast. Everything was really good and I was super happy. Will go back soon !!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is absolutely delicious and very good portions. They also usually have a $5 deal of the day, which is an unbeatable price for what you get. The environment is great, and they have TV's plastered everywhere. Definitely an underrated place to go in Champaign!"}
{"text":"The Hub recently started brunch and I'm sold! How can u go wrong with bottomless mimosas for 5 bucks!?!?! It's like heaven. My fav is deffinatly the bacon bits inside the breakfast burrito delicious !  It's the perfect place to watch any sporting event on  their humongous TV! This place is AMAZING I highly recommend it to anyone who is in the area, and is looking good food, clean place, and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and dinner the night before.  The Siracha burger last night and the BBQ chicken pizza were both great! Thanks for the great service and great food and even better atmosphere.   There is no other place like it here in Chambana!"}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour for the food to arrive. Ordered eggs benedict and pancakes. Eggs benedict was overpriced, small, and overcooked. Poor quality for the price. Might as well go to better brunch places in downtown champaign."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out The Hub after the Illini basketball exhibition game yesterday.  We decided to share some apps and order a few craft beers.  Jumbo wings were on special for $1 a wing. We tried three of the honey garlic wings. They were pretty tasty though I wouldn't consider the ones we had jumbo.  We really enjoyed the Three Amigos appetizer --- fresh and delicious guacamole, queso, and salsa. Would definitely recommend this! There is a slight upcharge for additional chips.   Decent beer selection --- we had JT Walkers Orange and Blue and Revolution Anti-Hero."}
{"text":"The Hub is not far from my office so my coworkers and I have ordered delivery from here twice. It's a 2-3 minute drive. If we walk it takes 15 minutes. We usually get delivery.  I loved their Spicy Sriracha Burger. It definitely had a great kick to it. Just make sure you eat slow or you will more certainly feel the heat! The fries were okay.  This last time we all got The Uptown which is a popular item according to Grubhub. You get a lot of pasta which would be okay if it were dinner and if you got something to compliment it like bread, but you don't get any sides. Personally it was just too much and very thick.  The short rib that was in The Uptown was very fatty and I had to pick most of it out because I couldn't chew it.  Both times we ordered delivery it took our food an hour an a half to 2 hours to get delivered. Not sure if it is their own delivery or if it's a 3rd party service but either way very disappointing.  We tried to call after an hour and forty minutes and all they said was that the delivery driver was on their way. They kept questioning us if we provided good enough directions if any at all. We of course know people have difficulties finding our office so we did provide very detailed directions.  After we got off the phone with them, the delivery driver called claiming to be lost saying we didn't provide directions with our order (which we saw clearly in our order). He pulled up 30 seconds later. The food was very cool so we knew it was sitting for a while.  The Hub does have some decent food but the delivery isn't worth the wait especially when we make sure it is after 1:30pm so their lunch rush is mostly past. We may give them another chance but I personally won't go back."}
{"text":"I give this place one star, just because our waitress was awesome. Her name is Jamie and she was very good.   We came for the first game of the NLDS, Cubs vs Giants. We expected it to be busy. Walked in the door, there were already about 8 people waiting with no hostess to be found. We figured they were all together, so went to the bar to sit for a minute. There were still TONS of empty tables at this point. We asked the bartender who the hostess was and he was really rude about it, so I went up to a server's station where two employees were. I asked them their advice for finding the hostess since we'd been waiting so long. Jamie offered us a table in her section and got us taken care of right away. They looked understaffed, I only saw 2 people serving tables. We ordered and our food came out pretty quickly, but was only sub-par. We also both ordered the fish and chips because they advertised it on their facebook page as $6. Come to find out the special was over at 3:30 pm. The ad said nothing about this. TVs are nice but I'd rather be at Buffalo Wild Wings or Old Chicago. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"Bathroom is actually horrendous. Vomit everywhere. Shit on walls. Piss on the ceiling. They give out mango mimosas and dont tell you until it is too late.  They never brought me my coffee and gave someone a spicy bloody mary when she specifically said she wanted the mild one. The portions are small. The food tastes decent but their service sucks. Not worth the money. You can get a better meal and service at mary annes."}
{"text":"They don't seat anyone with over 12 open tables and claim they have all these reservations. Hostess is rude. This bar is losing money by not seating people. Clueless waitresses. People just sitting at there tables not spending money. People are lining up to spend money at this place and they won't seat you with so many open tables. This place is a college bar not a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"I think the overall rating should be higher. I've been here a couple of times now. Always ask what the food special of the day is as they always have one.  The burgers are by far the best in the Champaign area. I am not getting burgers anywhere after this. The mac n cheese was good but it's too unhealthy. Not my thing, but certainly good.  It's fun watching sports games here and the staff is very accommodating with seating you facing a game you want to watch. I wanted to watch basketball games during the baseball world series and was able to.  They have an upper area that parties can reserve for events. Seems like a good place to host one.  I had an incident where they were only giving me one hooked deal when we both used. One burger was full price and only one was discounted. I asked if I could split the bill and then they chose to give me both discounts. This is understandable. They just opened at that time.  I don't drink much so I can't talk about that but this is a good place to eat even if you don't drink."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time this past Saturday to grab some lunch. When we arrived, however, it was still their brunch time (10am-2pm) so it was absolutely packed. They offer bottomless mimosas for $6.00 and there were a ton of college students taking advantage of that deal.   We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but we didn't mind. We took the time to take in the atmosphere and really liked the layout of the restaurant. It has that sports bar feel with an abundance of TV's including a giant projector screen.  Once we were seated, we both decided to forgo the mimosas and grab a couple beers (drafts are $3.00 on Saturdays). Our table was near the bar, which was far from ideal as there was a large crowd that just congregated there the entire time. It made us feel a little cramped for space. After looking over the menu I decided to get the chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got a burger. Both were quite good, but nothing special.   I feel like we may have stopped here at a bad time, hence the less than stellar experience, but it's such a cool place that we'll be back to check it out again. We'll certainly be mindful to go when it's a little less crowded."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential; the inside is completely new and has a sports bar ambiance, similar to Buffalo Wild Wings. Unfortunately, this is the third time that I have been disappointed doing business here. Although the menu was not very versatile or exciting, the food was pretty good. However, they discontinued bottomless mimosas, which does not seem like the best business decision especially since it's one of the few sit down breakfast restaurants on a college campus. The music choice was a bit odd for brunch, but shout out to Magic Mike. The service was slow and sub-par at most. If this restaurant continues to maintain the same experience, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is so disappointing. It was empty at 12:30 during lunch hour, that should have been a sign. I got the tacos with salsa because that was their special. I had one bite of the salsa, which was actually pretty good, and then I immediately see an old chip floating in the salsa. Ok...won't be having anymore of that. Start eating my tacos, they were ok, not much flavor. I did like the fried jalapeños though. As I'm finishing up the taco I see a red hair in my food..... they took it off my bill but I won't be back nor do I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is nice and new and well designed. It has a very trendy look. Service was alright considering it is new and it is staffed with students. They could pay a little closer attention. The food was pretty good but the prices are way too high for a campus joint. $9 for 6 very small wings. $12 burger. The drinks were high as well. Even the draft beer. You can buy draft beer downtown Champaign for less. I like the atmosphere and if they want to charge a little more and appeal to an older crowd like the places downtown do, the food, drinks, and service needs to meet the quality level. I'll probably give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Um. Their Supreme Bloody comes with a friggin' slider on it. Obviously, you HAVE to get it. It's a super tasty bloody mary as well, so no ragrets. If you're more of a mimosa gal/guy, their bottomless mimosas are PHENOM. They pre-mix the juice and champagne and usually have 4 or 5 varieties per Sunday. They are boozy af.  Food's just dece, which is why I knocked down a star. But it's carb-y enough you don't stumble out the door.  Make sure to get there before 10:30/11 AM on a weekend day, else you'll be in line for way too long.   Seems they have a live DJ setup which is cool cool. Loud, but cool."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! The Hub is currently under new management and safe to say don't waste your time. We went with a party of 6 for brunch and they nearly removed half of the menu. The decided to take all Mac n cheese off the menu (without any heads up), no salads and no chicken sandwiches. Furthermore, when our food came it was bland and hard to eat. We had to ask for napkins and utensils. Finally after our meal our waiter never cleaned the table and we even got dessert (which they were out of our original choice) and had to eat it among all of our dirty plates. Overall, do not waste your time or money on this establishment."}
{"text":"Ever wonder what Donald Trump's sports room looks like. This is it. You have to come here to watch any and every game! Service was great, food was great (classic burger), and the atmosphere is awesome. This place will become a staple in Champaign for years and years."}
{"text":"We were sadly very disappointed with the Hub. We ordered the Hub sampler and burgers and weren't happy with either item. The burger bun was soggy and the meat was flavorless and had a strange texture. Our waiter was pushy and openly told us his shift was ending and we should hurry up. We had high hopes going into this place, but will not be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"This is a swanky new restaurant & bar near the University of Illinois Campus. It is a huge space with a nice relaxed urban feel. There are many huge TVs and cool lightning all around. The people who work there are super friendly. I come here for lunch or dinner a few times a week. They have really good food specials and pricing. My favorite is the Spicy Siracha Burger. It's soooo good! If you haven't been to this joint, check it out soon. Great place for a date or social gathering!"}
{"text":"First off the food was excellent! Absolutely no complaints in the food department; tasty and affordable! This place would easily get my five star approval if it weren't for the service. I went for brunch and took part in the \"bottomless mimosas\" for an hour, but about halfway through my party was told they were out of champagne. I would either expect my money back or my time extended but neither was done. The waitress was a bit sassy when we asked for refills once they restocked because our \"time was up\" but there was a large gap while we waited. A bit disappointed in how this was handled considering the food was delicious and the restaurant was very clean and affordable."}
{"text":"Since my terrible experience, I've returned to The Hub for mac and cheese and chicken wings and both have been great! The service has really improved and I love the food! Will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. if it was possible to rate a negative zero i would. For the 2 mins what we were there, no one to greet us nor seat us, no one even around in site that worked there, the other customers did not even have their food about 10+ people already seated. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger for me in Champaign Urbana area so far. I think I like it better than farren's.  I got the classic with pepper jack cheese. I thought it was unusual that they didn't offer American cheese. But their pepperjack is actually spicy! So often you taste pepperjack that isn't spicy. I think I've had so many poorly seasoned burgers that I was so happy to finally taste a burger that actually was seasoned nicely, the burger meat had a taste.   My only recommendation to this place is to increase your patty size. In my opinion the patty is not big/thick enough to complement the ratio of the bun and the extras. A larger patty size would elevate the burger to the level of some of the great burgers in Chicago imo.   Normally I would give it 5 stars but I had an unusual experience there for lunch. I came with a friend and we both got burgers. The manager accidentally gave our burgers to the table next to us and we suspected it was ours since we ordered about 15 minutes before they did. We saw them eat the fries and touch the burgers with their hands (they didn't eat the burger). The manager then realized his mistake and then took the burgers back to the kitchen and within a minute came back to us and told us that they switched out the fries and that the other table didn't eat the burger. He said he would comp the burgers for us because of the mistake. We told him we wanted a fresh burger because we literally saw the other table touching the burger. He said that's fine and took the burgers back. Within 5 minutes we got a \"new\" burger. I'm not ashamed to admit that I liked their burgers enough to have eaten there 3 times that day, and 3 times the burger took around 15 minutes to make. How did our \"new\" burgers come out in 5 minutes? Perhaps because they weren't new. I suspect they didn't want to waste it and took it back to the kitchen and waited 5 minutes before bringing it out. I'm not one to give up free food regardless if some random person touched it lol. So I just ate it, but I'm not convinced it was a fresh burger."}
{"text":"In for lunch today...new and clean with modern atmosphere and a cold feel. I ordered the Sriracha burger, it was tasty but I must say the bun overwhelmed the beef patty. The fries are thin cut crispy and done the way I like them. I'm giving them 3 stars due to the place was empty and our order took forever, the kitchen personal need to pick it up!  I'll bet this place kicks when it's packed during football season!"}
{"text":"Decided to hit the new place in town! First thing I noticed when I walked in was the very cool atmosphere. However they joint was close to empty for a Friday night at 7pm... It was very nice lighting and good music as well as having the Hawks game on. They had some good deals like $5 flatbread and $5 cocktails. We started with the Korean BBQ wings which were almost sour, they needed a tad more sweetness. They also labeled the wings as 'jumbo'. They were not jumbo.  I also had the BBQ chicken flatbread which was very good. They seemed to skimp out on the chicken a bit but otherwise it was delicious. My boyfriend had the burger with Mac and cheese on it, he said it was good but a little small. The fries were fantastic, they tasted just like McDonald's fries. YUM. I also had the 'illini' mojito which was pretty good, I think it could have used a touch more mint.  The place was spotless which I very much appreciated. And the service was friendly. And our food came out very quickly. Overall I was impressed with this new place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start with what's important: long wait time, slow service, overpriced food  As a group of 2, we were assured a 15-minute wait time which turned into 30, which I would normally be fine with if not for several parties arriving after us getting seated before us. Remember this pattern.  The restaurant happened to \"run out of eggs\" so they closed the brunch menu, and overall seemed unprepared for one of the biggest weekends on campus (Homecoming). From the time we placed our order we must have waited about an hour to finally get our food. Once again, parties seated after us got their food before us. The waitress remained friendly and sympathetic, but it didn't make up for the slow service.  Finally, the food arrived and I was disappointed with the quantity-to-price. While the taste was great, the small portion sizes left me dissatisfied.  This place has great amenities, but the lack of organization and service leads me to believe the places is poorly managed. I am willing to give this place another try during brunch (despite a patron sitting next to us saying that the service is always poor) and I'll be sure to post and update."}
{"text":"Amazing vibes. Visiting from New York and this place for sure makes me feel at home. Great service, great music and great food. Not to mention the bottomless mimosas for $7 and season flavors kind of help =P"}
{"text":"Awful service and very average food. This place needs to put some new management in place if it plans on staying in business for the long term."}
{"text":"If you like Mac & cheese and sports, you will probably love the Hub. Casual sports joint with a dedicated mac & cheese menu. Nothing really stands out here but it is an enjoyable time.  Edit: I guess they got rid of the Mac & cheese menu. I'm not really sure why since this was really their only niche. I'll have to come back and judge it, although I'm not sure what would bring me back now."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar environment, and does not get too loud. The food is quality and the specials are pretty good deals. Drinks are over-priced compared to other on campus restaurants"}
{"text":"Great food. Our order got messed up and they offered to remake the food. I don't think the food was remade, it was very quick. I ended up getting 2 burgers when I went to eat here. Each time it took about 10-20 minutes for the burger to come out, but the fresh burger came out way too fast. Its very good food and I would come back, I'm just not too happy with the experience I had after the order got messed up. They gave us the burgers for free, but may have not told the truth about remaking it."}
{"text":"The service here is comically bad. I've never been and not have them mess up someone's order in my party. The food is so-so for the price. Only real reason to come here is for the bottomless mimosas on the weekend."}
{"text":"While I personally think that the \"best burger in town\" remains Jurassic Burger in campus town, burgers at the Hub are delicious. I recommend the spicy goodness of the Siracha burger. It has the perfect amount of Siracha mixed with kale slaw, it was perfection.   Fair warning their wings still need a bit of work (over sauced and the Korean BBQ flavor wasn't very Korean). However this is exactly the kind of kink that a new place like this can work out over time. I anticipate that this might become for the west side of campus what Legends is for the center of campus."}
{"text":"Recently went back to the Hub to try out their new brunch on weekends and I've got to say they've stepped up their game. Me and about 7 other friends went and all liked the food we got and the unlimited mimosas were delicious. I see they now have weekly drinks specials too. Great decision on their part. Haven't tried there regular menu again but after having the brunch I would be willing to try it again. Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. A couple of times that I've been in when it wasn't busy the service was great. But the other times the servers seemed confused, forgot certain parts of our orders, and didn't refill our waters. Bloody marys are terrible: flavor off and too watery. Used to get and take to go their mac n cheese but it looks like they've gotten rid of mac n cheese entirely from their menu. Didn't think their menu could be more limited, but the new one is. It seems like they're trying to be a nightclub, but that isn't the vibe us students get. Should have stuck to the good food and focused on advertising more. All the changes lost the parts of the hub I loved so I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would have liked this place more if I wanted the kind of stuff they serve: more on the starchy side of comfort food. Like, they offer multiple types of macaroni and cheese. Most likely, someone who wanted mac and cheese or burgers or flatbread sandwiches would rate it even higher. I liked it, but the menu didn't give me a lot of options in terms of the kind of food I would have chosen.  We came in on a rainy afternoon and it was basically empty, which seemed strange, but service was fast. Hubby had the sriracha burger, which he liked, although it kind of messed his stomach up later in the day. It's not just sriracha; there are also large pieces of jalapenos in there, so keep that in mind if you have a low spice tolerance. The fries were good. I had the wings. I think the sauce was chili mango or something like that. A bit sweeter than I wanted but a nice degree of heat. Kind of sloppy. Juicy and tender inside."}
{"text":"Been to the Hub a few times now, one of the nicer and newer campus options at UIUC. The layout and design is hip and trendy while being appealing to all. Overall the food is tasty, especially the Mac-n-Cheese Burger (would suggest) as well as the nachos as an appetizer. The place has always been fairly busy whenever I pass by on the weekends. The food is tasty, but a bit overpriced for what you receive. They should change the menu up a bit here and there for more diversity, however none the less, they do have some solid menu items. I will be back to The Hub again."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. The first drink I ordered, she asked for a 2nd choice because it had been a busy weekend and she didn't know what was in stock and indeed they did not have the ingredients for my first choice. This was on a Tuesday night with a liquor store on the ground floor of the building. I got two different drinks which were expensive and not very tasty. We were a large group with a long-standing reservation. We all waited a long time for our food with plates coming out widely spaced apart. My nachos (ironically an appetizer)came last at my table and several other people were done eating completely by the time I got my food. Food was only OK. We all agreed not worth the long wait. Would not recommend or go again. Lots of better options in town."}
{"text":"The food is ok and things are fairly clean. The restrooms are anything but private. If you want a spicy meal then anything on the menu will work."}
{"text":"This is probably going to be my favorite hangout place in Champaign! The ambience is very trendy , perfect for a college town. The TV there is HUGE! Awesome to watch ALL the games there! Coming from Chicago I think the prices are rather cheap which is great on a students budget. They always have some real cool specials going too: esp the $5 burger on Wednesdays! I got the Sriracha burger : beware a lit spicy but I loved it! The s'mores dessert was to die for.  Great service too! Excited to have this new hot spot in Champaign"}
{"text":"This is right next to my apartment but it's just not worth going to. There's not a great selection of alcohol and the food is over priced. It also takes forever to figure out where you're going to sit... theres just so much potential but I feel that since they opened they haven't been able to figure out how to work...."}
{"text":"Great vibe in what will certainly be the premier sports bar/restaurant in Champaign. This place opened last week but Chef and the GM are bringing a wealth of experience to fill a void in the area. From the apps to the mac-n-cheese, to the burgers, holy smokes! Best wings (hands down) in Chambana. Nachos rocked and the craft beers were ice cold. The food is the bomb, mainly due to Chef Terrah and her hand picked crew that hit a home run on every dish. Great presentations with the modern table settings and a friendly wait staff. My party of 4 have nothing but the highest compliments. Can't wait to come back! Parking is on the south side but is limited. Park on the meters across First Street which are free after 6. Seriously, you have to visit this place, especially during your favorite sporting event because the tv screens are incredible. Did I mention the bar? Wow."}
{"text":"Ashley was awesome!  Adam had an attitude...  was having a better time till his negative attitude arrived..."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very nice. It has a nice vibe, but the menu does not have a very wide selection. Based on the look of the place, I expected the food to be way better! Place has potential but not there yet."}
{"text":"When bars try to do brunch: not always a happy ending. I think the HUB is trying to make a name for itself, but it's failing to do so. The burgers are mediocre. The tacos are dry. The brunch pancakes pale in comparison to fluffy, buttermilk pancakes. In a city that has so much to offer, the HUB fails to deliver a menu that stands out. The seating and restaurant is a great place to sit. Other than the aesthetics - it doesn't have much else to offer."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my wife. Awesome sports bar atmosphere with a little extra class. Tacos were awesome! They had a good selection of drafts, even a couple local brews. Planning to go back soon."}
