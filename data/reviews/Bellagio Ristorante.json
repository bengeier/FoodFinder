{"text":"We went here on vacation. The hotel concierge said the food would be good, not a party in your mouth (his actual words). It was close to the hotel. The food was ok Italian, not great but ok. The service was very slow on a slow business night. We decided to have dessert, a shot of Frangelico and coffee. First the alcohol was wrong Limoncello. Big difference on all counts. They fixed that. The dessert was good. The coffee was so bad we couldn't drink it. Not the way you want a meal to end.  I wouldn't go back there when there are better choices."}
{"text":"I will give this place 5 stars all daylong. Try the veal chop or anything on the table d'hote and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Along with the complimentary bread, you get a nice bruschetta.  The menu has a nice selection of lamb, poultry, seafood, veal, and pasta dishes  I tried the gamberi provenciale.  The large shrimp were sauteed in a lemon, butter, herb, and garlic sauce.  It came with vegetable and rice side dishes."}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended this as a good restaurant to go to with kids. Wow. We were certainly surprised when we arrived with our kids to dirty looks from most. We asked how long the wait would be and the man said at least 45 minutes but no promises, it could be much longer. Since we didn't know where else to go in the city and had trekked all the way there with our three kids we said we would wait. I guess they realized they were not getting rid of us that easily and miraculously 5 minutes later there was a table for us.   The waiter was much nicer and accommodating to our family. He split a dish on to two plates for our kids and put tomato sauce on the side as requested by them. My steak was mediocre. For the size of the steak, about half of it was fat. I would have been more impressed with a small piece of quality steak rather than a gigantic one that you couldn't eat a lot of.   All in all, I would not recommend this to families unless you have teenagers that will quietly sit and eat dinner. Our small children are very used to eating out and traveling and were well behaved at this meal and we still very much felt out of place in this restaurant. We felt rushed to leave and unsatisfied after the meal. Disappointed in this Montreal dining experience."}
{"text":"They had me at bruschetta.  This is the first Italian restaurant I've been to that gave complimentary bruschetta with the bread and oil and it was a really nice touch.  It was a quite weeknight with only a couple of other customers inside so the service was prompt and friendly.  I started with the Stracciatella which was absolutely delicious.  For an entree I ordered the Fettucini Bel Sol which is relatively simple but was very good.  I normally would have also had some wine but wasn't drinking that night so I can't comment on that.  They did appear to have a very large selection though.  I wasn't able to take advantage of this but they had signs in the entrance that parking would be free.  It looked like only street parking in the area so I'm not sure if they validate it or how that works.  I would happy return here after checking out a few of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Rien de bien extraordinaire, je ne peux pas donner plus qu'un 3 étoiles a ce restaurant italien.  Nous avons tous les deux pris des escalopes de veau, et avons été déçus. (ce n'était pas la même sauce) La bruschetta servie en entrée goûtait celle déjà préparée de l'épicerie et la sauce du veau goûtait la sauce en sachet. Très décevant.  L'ambiance et le service étaient agréables, même si le décor n'a rien d'italien et fait même vieillot."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate a colleague's thesis defense and we were around 10 people. The food was plentiful and delightful. Most of us ordered the table d'hôte (in some of the several different options) and we all ended up being quite full. Pretty good wine as well!  The waiters are very polite and trilingual, and they gave us bread at the beginning and fruit at the end. As it is usual in restaurants of this caliber, they made sure we had Parmesan and pepper at will.  I ordered an Osso Bucco and some of my friends were quite jealous. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture, but I can attach my friends succulent Smoked Salmon Salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our two kids here for dinner. The bread and bruschetta while we were waiting were delicious. There was no kids menu but the staff were very accommodating in serving half portions for them. The staff were very friendly and answered a number of questions about the menu, both in French and English. The pasta was fresh and delicious, and both the stuffed veal and the chicken Marsala were great. The portions were large and we all left full and satisfied. We also loved the house white wine."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. We had the fixed menu which came with your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert plus we had 1/2 liter of wine, sparkling water and an espresso for around $100 plus tip. The cod special was amazing and the veal was very good. Veal was very tender and the tiramisu was the best I've had. Very good service too."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of our hotel. From the outside, it's very unassuming - it's on the ground floor corner of a corporate building. Inside, it looks like a cute Italian restaurant. We went a little late so it wasn't too busy. Went with my wife and 2 teen kids. In short, the service was excellent - the waiters were clearly trilingual and they treated us like we were in their home. We all order an entree.  But first there was the bread.  Expected and good.  Unexpected was the complimentary bruschetta that was clearly recently made. The entrees were good.  A bit heavy on the salt, but all very flavorful.  The linguine was in red clam sauce on the menu, but they were happy to change it to white sauce.  It was huge and very tasty.  I had the penne romanoff which was basically ala vodka. We also had the chicken marsala and the fettucine caprese.  Everything is what you'd expect as textbook Italian food.  Afterwards, since we ate everything we got, we declined dessert. But, they gave us complimentary fruit and nuts in the shell - had fun cracking open a few.  All in all, a solid Italian eatery in Montreal."}
{"text":"Although The food took lilke 30 mins to get to us, it was amazing! I ordered the chicken with some pasta and it was delicious! Love this place ;)"}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful meal, service and food! I would go back tomorrow if I could! Professional and attentive waiters and the food is simply delicious! I've eaten at hundreds of Italian restaurants and this one is very, very enjoyable! Relaxing and a very pleasant place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is rather delightful. While there seemed to be some backlog at the entryway, the general decor and ambiance makes this establishment feel classy. The tables are done well, the waiters (I decline to use the word 'servers' here on purpose) are attentive, and cooperative - this translates to better table side service. The wine menu is pleasant, and they serve free bruschetta. Their bread is also really soft, and served warm - pretty decent table balsamic vinegar. We both ordered pasta, and again, while the service time was a bit long (20 mins for a main dish), we were distracted by the appetizers. The restaurant also delivers on menu ingredients as listed for the dishes (lots of clams, bacon/ham, mushrooms, etc - none of the pretentiousness followed by a paltry portion). The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff. In all, it was a great experience. For as large and well maintained an area, it was largely empty for a late Friday night dinner, but at about $50/person, the service is rather impeccable!"}
{"text":"This was a great Italian restaurant!  My wife, 15 year old daughter and I went there our first night in Montreal as it was close to our flat.  The service was incredibly attentive and nice - spoke English, French, Italian and Spanish.  The food was incredible.  We had beautiful entree and seconde dishes - prosciutto and melon (as tasty as in Italy), gnocci, salade, and fettuccine.  But the service - it was outstanding!  We had a bottle of wine, and never had an empty glass.  They even brought a dish of fruit and a bowl of nuts before our dessert and bread, rolls and bruschetta before our meal.  So well recommended."}
