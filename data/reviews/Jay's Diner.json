{"text":"This is my favourite diner. It's a bit of a drive for a diner for me, but I still go. This is my new favourite french toast, they also use real maple syrup. The chicken club is also amazing. One of my favourite things about this place is the coffee. It's strong and delicious. I live in the Yonge and Eg neighbourhood and it's still worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best diners in the city in my view. The food is so fresh, their omelettes are delicious, and their sandwiches are to die for. I've now been about half a dozen times in the last month and the quality of the food is consistently outstanding. And all the wait staff are so nice! What can I say? Super high quality!!"}
{"text":"Will definitely go back.  Great addition to the Lawrence Ave W to Wilson stretch that really lacks good sit down breakfast options.    BREAKFAST Quality diner breakfast.  The most important thing is that they automatically serve pancakes and French toast with REAL maple syrup!!!  FRESH SQUEEZED Orange Juice was sooooooo good.    French toast has cinnamon in the batter.  Perfectly cooked.  I think it was Challah bread.  Comes with a little garnish of fresh melon and pineapple; it is evident they know what they are doing by how perfectly they were cut.    Pancakes are fluffy and perfectly golden all the way across.  A little dusting of icing sugar.  Even after they cooled off while I tackled the rest of the breakfast combo, they were tasty.  You can get pancakes or French toast with a berry mixture if you prefer.  Breakfast combos are generous, as they should be.  A few types of meat, eggs, toast, pancakes, chunky home fries, fruit garnish.  Home fries were moist and salty in a good way.    I'd prefer pork sausage breakfast links with natural or no casings, but these were browned well yet still yummy and juicy.  I'm not a fan of their drip coffee.  I found it bitter/dark.  I'll admit I prefer a medium roast, though.  That won't stop me from ordering again.  LUNCH I did not eat lunch here, but I saw they have some salads, wraps, clubs, and other sandwiches.  From my initial impression of their offerings, I'd be tempted to try lunch if I was in the area but it wouldn't be a destination lunch whereas I'd go a little out of my way for their breakfast.  VALUE It's been a long time since I felt the prices were perfectly matching for quality and portion size.  Hooray!  DECOR What decor they have is fun and kitschy.  Each table has a different ceramic salt and pepper shaking set, which kids will love:  turkeys, frogs, pigs, chicks, etc.  Baby blue walls (just like the sign out front) with white molding is very fresh and new looking; so, the place looks and smells clean.  Lots of bright light from the front windows and a big mirror on the wall helps brighten it up even more (I could see myself nursing coffee here in the winter to chase away winter blues).  New, dark brown, little bar topped with a shiny espresso machine.  Looks like they grind coffee beans to order for espresso beverages.  Big glass iced water dispenser with spigot is on the bar, which looks refreshing in the summer.  Two TV's: high on the back wall & front area.    SEATING & GROUPS It is a rather narrow space that only has about 30-40 seats. I believe one table was set up to hold 6 people, but I think it might be harder to accommodate groups.  I'd feel comfortable calling ahead to arrange a table of 8.  Mostly tables of 2 and 4.  STAFF They have abundant service staff.  The owner and staff are fairly young, but I overheard their conversations, and they are CLEARLY foodies.  They are attentive and enthusiastic.  We were impressed how the server interacted with two young children (one fussy) that was dining there.  Get this!  They are professional, which is usually impossible to find at a diner where food is traditionally schlepped.  PARKING There is some metered Green P machine parking on Avenue Rd that can be hard to come by.  There is mix of limited Green P machine and 1 hour free street parking on the side streets to the east.  If you are willing to walk a full block east on the side streets past Elm Rd, there is 2 hour free street parking in abundance.  Frankly, the street parking in that area frustrates me enough that I always drive straight back past Elm.  Avoid Roe Ave where too many people park illegally to get their Starbucks and meter enforcers frequent.  HANDICAP The dining area is level.  The aisle is wide enough for a wheelchair.  All of the chairs pull out, so a wheelchair could pull up to the table.  I can't recall the entrance having steps, but I believe there was a slight step up.  I did not see the washrooms to know if they are accessible."}
{"text":"We love breakfast and brunch and were excited another diner was opening in the neighbourhood. Jay's diner keeps it simple but that's okay if it's Done well. My husband had their belt buster which was a complete traditional breakfast with 2 slices of toast and generous sized pancakes. I tried their eggs Benedict which were perfectly runny. Well done! Even the best diners overcook poached eggs. Service was efficient and friendly. My 1 yr old Enjoyed the melon and fruit on the side and bites of Pancakes. We will definitely go back! Welcome To the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Living around the corner I have already been able to visit Jay's twice for breakfast and at this point in time I feel comfortable saying Jay's \"is what it is\".  Oh hey, look at that.. I forgot to finish writing this for the past two weeks.  Well, I lost my train of thought.  Try the pancakes I guess?"}
