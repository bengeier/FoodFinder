{"text":"This was one of the first food truck experiences we have had and it was terrible - enough that we may never consider another food truck.  The fish and spices they use are WRONG - and ruined the dish.  I was born and raised in Massachusetts with fresh fish and plenty of \"fish and chip\" places - and lived in England for four years and ate the \"orginall\" fish and chips - cod and haddock are the only real type of fish for fish and chips.  The fish Oak City uses is \"fishy fishy\" tasting and along with the spices - very bad.  They just have to change the type of fish and use more traditional spices - beer batter and etc."}
{"text":"Then ALL of my money should have been refunded!!! My issue wasn't the fact that they \"threw it away\" my issue was the poor customer service i received after the fact!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was quick, and everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. I visited at the very first Black Food Truck Friday (yay!!), and was not disappointed. 

Although i imagined there being a long wait for my small (yeah, right) order of fish and calamari fried hard, it only took about 5 minutes. I sat in the car and ate and could not wait for my fiance to get his meal from another truck before I devoured my entire piece of fish. It's a shame that it was so good, bc I really wanted him to taste it. The tarter sauce added the perfect amount of salt to the spices on the fish. 

The calamari was cooked perfectly, but I had to bring most of it home to add some fresh lemon and marinara sauce. That's the only real down side that I experienced, bc I really have to have something to dip my calamari in. 

 Condiments were on the side of the truck for customers to help themselves and included packets of tater, hot sauce, ketchep, and a jar of vinegar. I'm not really sure of what one would do with the vinegar, as this fish is solid to stand alone. I wouldn't want to ruin the crunch nor flavor from the spices, but oh well. With that being said, this is NOT your typical fish and chips place. I think the name may be more of a tipoff for what they sale than the infamous beer-battered, airy crunch cod. This is definitely more of a southern fish and seafood deal, but I'm not mad about it! The food is still delish! 

 Oh, my meal also came with fries, which I didn't expect from reading the menu. I ate a good bit of the fries befor touching the fish, and they were hot, crispy, and seasoned with some of the same spices that topped the fish.

 I got a drink from another truck, as Oak City only had water. This wouldn't be a problem if I were healthy, but I really like a good sweet tea to wash down a meal like this. 

My plate was truly a show-stopper, as many people came over to find out where I had purchased it. Even as I crossed the street back to my car, passersby slowed their cars to take a good look...hopefully that brought them more business! I'm sold, and will definitely be on the lookout for this truck again!"}
{"text":"I didnt get to try the food, but I'm annoyed because they were on the calendar to be in my business park and were no where to be found. Plus nobody would answer the phone. Not a good look."}
{"text":"I came to the Novel at NoDa Lightroom extension event  at the 36th St Station.
The portion sizes are more than enough. They give a lot of fries which I absolutely love but you can easily share. The seasoning has some kick and heat to it so keep that in mind. It's not spicy but it's not laughing salt and pepper either. There also some small bones in the fish so watch when buying food for small children."}
