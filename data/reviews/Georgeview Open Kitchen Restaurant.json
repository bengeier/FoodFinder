{"text":"Clasic diner-style brunch in Georgetown.  Good portion sizes, well priced, fast service, good quality food.  One of the best places to eat in Georgetown!"}
{"text":"Great family diner atmosphere. Good food, great prices and amazing staff.   Milkshakes, home fries, burgers- classic diner without it being super crowded.   Definitely a classic hole in the wall  restaurant. Parking is hard"}
{"text":"Had our good Friday fish and chips at the georgeview. I meant to take a pic but it looked so good I just dug in! Light batter. Nice white flaky fish. Crisp fries. This may just end up being our good Friday tradition."}
{"text":"Good Bacon N' Egg place, waffles are great. Service is super fast and very good price. Wish the coffee was better. Coffee 2.5/5 Service 5/5 Food 4/5 Ambiance 4/5"}
{"text":"Sorry Georgetown - I have to disagree. This diner is in a run down strip mall - and the decor was horrible. Needs a TOTAL make over. The staff was friendly and improved our initial impression of this venue. Then we went to the washroom to wash our hands (smh) mmmmGross! My five year old did not want to go in. He said this was an ugly bathroom and didn't want to touch anything (good thing).   I suppose the food could pass (with a push), but it was just mediocre. I don't give out bad reviews so I gave this place three stars because of the friendly staff. I wanted to love this place based on the reviews but it was an epic #FAiL.   **I really want the management to know that its ok to change the 1970s puke-colored vinyl bench seats and baby poo coloured green paint. Please hire a restaurant reno company. xoxo. I think you can do so much better."}
{"text":"A sign inside says 'since 1954', and for just passing 60 she's in great shape (I found out they actually renew the booths with the same old style to keep the original feel). Georgeview has the perfect old school small town diner feel that benefits from the life-long regulars to the high schoolers across the street.  The atmosphere is cozy and the food is comfy.   Not the biggest fan of breakfast sausages, I enjoyed the golden crispy outside and juicy inside. Bacon and eggs were just right, but the pancakes hit me.  They had a slight sweetness to them before even a drop of syrup. Speaking of syrup, it came with whipped butter which is a huge plus for me.   Service was friendly and simple to satisfaction. Price was undebatable.  I come to Georgetown during a few weeks for work each year and somehow haven't tried this local classic.  I think I'll be takin in the Georgeview again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, usually after a night of drinking and it has always helped with the hangovers. The food is high quality and the service is excellent. It is hands down the best breakfast place in Georgetown."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for all-day breakfast!! Great value, great portions and stellar service! Canadian omelette and a waffle for brunch is the real definition of \"breakfast of champions\"!!"}
