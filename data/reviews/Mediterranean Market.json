{"text":"I ordered food from here off Tapingo, and the service was horrendous. The courier called to tell me he was outside, but when I went outside, there was no one there. So I called him back, and he was at the wrong building. I spent about 15 minutes standing outside in the cold talking to him on the phone as he drove around, trying to get him to come to the correct address, but he would not come here, despite my efforts to help him and his claim that he was using a gps. From what he told me, he was waiting on the side of a road and blinked his lights, but I saw no one; at another time, he was at a building 10 minutes away, claiming it was the correct place, and eventually asked me to meet him there. I tried, but the gps on my phone would not connect, and I had no idea where the building was at the time. Eventually, he ended up leaving, so I called the restaurant, begging them to send someone else to deliver my food, but they told me that they only have one delivery person and they would call me back after talking to the original courier. When they called me back, they told me that it was somehow my fault, and I should have met the delivery guy where he was (which I tried to do even though it's expected that the courier meets YOU when you order food to be delivered). They called me back later, telling me that they would redeliver it if they were making any other deliveries in the area that night, otherwise I could ask Tapingo for a refund. When I asked Tapingo about a refund the next day since they did not redeliver the food, they told me that the restaurant refused to give me a refund, claiming that I gave them the wrong address (even though I order food to this address all the time and never have had an issue before, not to mention I think that I would know where I live better than they do). I never got to try the food, but I couldn't possibly imagine it's good enough to make up for the horrible experience I had. You can take a gamble at it if you want, but I personally don't want to support a business like this."}
{"text":"Ordered online through their website. With my entree they had me pick 2 sides and a salad. 2 of the sides I was going to order separately anyway before I realized. Upon arrival they informed me that \"that doesn't come with any sides it's just over rice\".  Nice to know now that they were here and already closed.  They had my number they could have called me at anytime before that and I probably would have just purchased them separately. Food itself was ok. I got the shrimp with rice and someone else got the chicken kebab.  Some of the rice was crunchy, and the chicken kebab was definitely a better value since it actually did come with both sides and rice. Their pita game was also lacking given we ordered 2 entrees as well as an order of hummus.  Also found it odd they didn't have the option to buy falafel or grape leaves on their own and not apart of a platter or sandwich.  Delivery was quick, but I will most likely be sticking to my usuals after this experience."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Been here three times, they remembered my name. Got fresh chicken for me. Price is very reasonable. The lady at the front counter was just so nice to me and my kids."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent service, I went there to buy \"dough\" I ended up spending $50 lots of goodies... The gentlemen at the register and every employee were extremely nice and polite. Their dolma are very good and inexpensive... I will definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in Pittsburgh. Everything is fresh and delicious. Even though the place doesn't look like much, the food more than makes up for it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"\"Mediterranean\" market with a halal butcher counter and a small dine-in area offering up falafel, kabob, and shwarma plates and sandwiches. Store itself isn't much: the other Euro markets have better selection and organization, and the only thing making this \"Mediterranean\" is their selection of baklava, olives, and olive oil. But all of their products can be found elsewhere in town, and their produce is less than fresh.
But the halal butcher is fairly unique: $27 for a giant lamb shank to be turned into a stew? Totally doable here.

Dine-in counter has a few basic tables and chairs but most orders seem to be for takeout. As advertised on a banner on building exterior, they have a chicken shwarma sandwich for $4.99. What the banner doesn't tell you is that it's a giant wrap with an amazing garlic sauce. That garlic sauce makes it, and it's what I miss from my favorite Med place in Texas. I'll come back for that, repeatedly!

Another score on the menu is the beef filet mignon kabobs: priced at a $12 plate for a good portion of tender, flavorful beef on a bed of yellow rice, with sides of marinated veggies and creamy hummus. Hummus was good, and is on the sides menu for about $5/portion along with babaghanoush and tabouli.

Come for the chicken shwarma wrap and the filet, but not much else. Do your grocery shopping elsewhere, grab your dinner to go. Counter service doesn't really speak English, so just know the number of the meal you're ordering."}
{"text":"Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"This place serves really good Chicken Shawarma for a cheap price and they are generous portion. Me and my husband go here solely for the Shawarmas The employees are respectful and nice"}
{"text":"Very slow. Don't care attitude of the person at the meat section is unbelievable. He's only nice to the arabs. Those who look different are treated like craps. No wonder the store is empty."}
{"text":"My family Loved this place! Food is excellent! Family business. Service was top notch! They make you feel like you are at home! Prices are good. Portions are huge! We will our regular spot. My daughter is still talking about her gyro."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Market has such a wonderful selection of great Middle Eastern and Greek food. Not only do they have a full market with many specialty items you cannot find elsewhere, but they also have a full produce section with hard to find produce and a halal meat counter with specialty cuts of beef and lamb.  

The man behind the counter, Assmat, he looks a little gruff but he is very nice and is very helpful. I told him I wanted to make something at home just like they did in the deli and he went department to department showing me what I would need. 

The prices are great - I think the most expensive item I bought was a $10 bottle of Olive Oil."}
{"text":"I come here often for Halal meats from the butcher. The prices seem to have gone up a little bit over the years, but still a great spot to have the produce cut up how you want it. I also come here at times to get their pita bread. I wish they had more in stock. They also have a small dining area designed for quick stops or carry-out."}
{"text":"Seriously great gyros, and the owner is so nice! SOOOOO much better than Mike & Tony's, everything is made FRESH!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some lunch and it was delicious.  I don't remember what we got, but we both enjoyed our meals.  Plus they have a bunch of spices and other stuff that is hard to find in town."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh made.  I had the Tabbouleh, grape leaves, hummous, and pita.  I was absolutely impressed by the authenticity, price and taste.  Good portion size.  Great choice for  Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and extremely personable service. Highly recommend the falafel and gyro sandwiches. Superb!!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot to shop for groceries. They always welcoming. Rose she is very sweet and friendly. People there are great. I just wish they have more fresh hand made sweets."}
{"text":"My first visit to this market in the Southside was after a long night Southside night.  So, standing at the corner of carson and 21st and seeing a place that is still serving Gyro's, there was no greater feeling.  I had one and it was great, so I got another.  Now at this time of night, my judgement could have been a bit jaded, but I tried them again later.  Still great.  Plus during the day they have a small family run mediterranean market that is perfect if you live close to that area so you dont have to walk further down carson."}
{"text":"My favorite Levantine (means foods like hummus, baba ganoush, taboule, gyros) in Pittsburgh! Delicious, reasonably priced, great service. They do everything the right way, with flavor! There aren't enough places like this in the city. Places that are family owned serving great food are a luxury people don't appreciate enough. Please try this place, you won't be disappointed! Support your local mom and pop restaurants"}
{"text":"I began coming here for a few items, about once every two months. Over time many of their items have grown on me. I go there to buy $1 pita bread almost every week. Then if I feel like splurging, I buy schwarma which completely blows me off my socks. If you think the chicken is good, try the beef."}
{"text":"Had the combo platter with beef, chicken,and kefta kebabs for $15. Was made fresh in front of you while you wait. Comes with pita bread, hummus, and salad.  Takes a little while, but worth the wait. Can't really rate the market part of it since I don't understand most of the writing on the items but seems like they had plenty of the ingredients to make the authentic dishes"}
{"text":"I had such a positive experience here that it compelled me to write my first yelp review. 

We were in the Chinatown area headed to my daughters school but we were an hour early so we decided to grab lunch. This was a completely last-minute \"hurry up, turn!\" food decision. Sometimes those last-minute decisions can be completely questionable but this was one of the better food decisions we've made in awhile. 

This place is a Mediterranean Market/Restaurant. Restaurant might be a misleading word because you order at the deli/meat counter and then seat yourself at the small section of tables and chairs. The guy at the counter is EXTREMELY nice and very personable even going as far as recommending not to order a side of gyro meat because our original order came with a lot of food! I got a very family vibe from the place, from the food to the service. They cared very much about your experience here. 

I ordered the 13.99 mixed kabob plate which  is 3 kabobs and is a lot of meat for that price. Most other kabob places give two skewers for that price. Meat quality was great and hummus was smooth and creamy. The highlight for me was a garlic sauce that i dipped my meats into that was super addicting! My fiancé had the beef kabob sandwich for 6.99 that he enjoyed also. 

They also sell a nice selection of baked goods, produce and meats. All in all a very great experience and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Was very impressed. Food was yummy. Good vegetarian selection. Delivered quickly. Would defiantly order from here again!"}
{"text":"This is a grocery store with a fast food section; the market side offers the typical Mediterranean articles such as pita bread, fresh produce and pickled and preserved veggies, etc.
The restaurant side offers delicious falafel; shawarma and kebab; HOWEVER, sanitary practices are very questionable, the cook goes from handling money, to cooking, to eating without ever washing his hands or even wearing gloves. Unsanitary conditions are most visible in the butcher section; old discolored cut meat and ground beef is visibly displayed, and dry blood is dripping all over over the meat display. And through it all the Health Department's A grade is proudly displayed at n the top of the meat display case. This place is overdue for an inspection."}
{"text":"Vegas has quite a few Mediterranean restaurants, but this is a hidden gem.  Although this is a supermarket with a small food court area and not an ideal place to spend an evening dining in, but the food are excellent. If you are looking for a good take out place with excellent tasty and healthy food, THIS IS IT !!!"}
{"text":"There's the market and then there's the restaurant. The restaurant is really a counter in the market. There are several tables to eat at, or you can take it to go

The market is pretty nice. There's an excellent variety of middle eastern products including a halal meat counter where you can get any part of a lamb you want. The place is clean and spacious and the prices are pretty good. 

The food in the restaurant I can only judge by the kefta sandwich that I ordered. My he kefta kebab sandwich was perfect!

I love in LA and found this place only because I was getting my car repaired nearby, but I wish it were closer to my house. I'll try to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What a gem of a find. I pass by this place ton and from work each day so finally today I had time to check it out. The market has a restaurant attached that u can order food from. It's a small menu but all the classics are there. I ordered the Kefta kabob plate and a beef swarma. Both were very good. And the service was quick as well, while waiting for the food in browsed the market and bought som juice, pits chips and baklava also. If definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great find for some international goodies. Deli counter w/ some yummy dishes to go.. I stopped in for 1 or 2 items & left with: hummus, dolma , basmati rice ,tabbouleh, Baba ghanouj, meat  pies in soft dough, pita, teas, fresh mint, peppers, sweet dates & figs. Will try the falafel next time !"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS! The staff are morons or at least the young woman with whom I spoke is. I called and asked if they carried Kefalotyri cheese, she said \"yes\", then I said it's a hard white Greek cheese for grating, again she said \"yes\". So I drove 12 miles from my house to the market. Went to the deli counter and asked the man if they had the cheese I wanted, he said it was in the cooler. I looked in the cooler but did not see it. Then I found the young woman and asked her; she took me back to the deli counter where they do not have it. I told her that the deli man said it was in the cooler but I did not see it. She looked in the cooler and did not find it. \"I'm sorry, I THOUGHT we had it\". I told her that's why I called first because I did not want to waste my time and gas. \"I'm sorry\", I thanked her for wasting my time and lying to me. \"I'm sorry.\" Always a pleasure to deal with someone who has a barely room temperature IQ. \"I'm sorry\"."}
{"text":"I had Lawrence T. stop in here with me because I wanted to pick up some rose water on 9/24/11. 

Thoughts:
-They need to spruce this place up. It looked straight up dirty.
-Put incense in an aisle, not at the exit, past the cash registers. 
-Take credit/debit cards if the purchase is less than $10 without a huge fee attached.

I had a bottle of Cortas rose water and a bottle of orange blossom water and found out that they don't take cards for a $6 transaction. I asked if I could just pay a service charge and she said it would be at least... $2.50 to pay with debit. Eff that. Lawrence pulled out cash and off we went.

I think the waters had been sitting on the shelf too long. The orange blossom water smells like... vomit. I don't know if the lid oxidized or what, but it smells awful. 

This place needs some work, but it could be good."}
{"text":"Really good gyro and the baba ghanouj was good as well.  Reasonable prices and the person working was very friendly.  The place doesn't look like much, but I imagine they do most of their business later in the evening!"}
{"text":"A deli inside of a grocery store.
Great shawarmas.
There are a few tables inside but it's great for pickup. Call ahead and give it 10 minutes."}
