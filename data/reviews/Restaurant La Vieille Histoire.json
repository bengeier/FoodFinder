{"text":"Have been here 3 times, the food is great and yes it's a bring your own wine restaurant! What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Best BYOB restaurant in the area. White linen tablecloth, fireplace, cordial service, and excellent food-both the taste and the presentation. The vegetable plate with the main course was outstanding- five different and colourful vegetables cooked perfectly.  Perfect for special evening."}
{"text":"Had been looking this one for a while, waited for the good opportunity to bring the wife while the kids were away. Picked up some Bourgogne at the SAQ (gotta love BYOW restaurants) and went on a quiet Friday evening.

The place was empty when we arrive (we aren't much for late dinners) so we picked a little table out of the way, near a window. The place is cozy, not too snobbish yet still a bit classy and authentic.

The waiter came fairly quickly to take our order and open the bottle of wine. We both had the \"dégustation\" menu which includes a soup, an appetizer, a \"trou normand\", main dish and a dessert. Within a few minutes our soups were there. I had the onion soup and it was delicious. The portions aren't really big but given that we took the full dinner, they were of an adequate size. We had a complimentary appetizer of crackers and rillette which was very good as well, and along came the bread basket (some other reviews will tell you about the very hard bread - the soft bread is all the way underneath the croutons in the basket).

Then we waited a fair bit to receive our appetizer, a little longer than usual for this type of restaurant. I had the grilled vegetables and cheese while my wife had the lobster raviolis. Both dishes were excellent. The trou normand was served, and I was a little disappointed by the size of it (although to be frank, I had a second helping since my wife didn't want hers).

As a main plate, I had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. For dessert, the coffee cheesecake which was very good as well. Coffee, on the other hand... was pretty weak. In retrospect, I should have ordered an espresso or a variation of it.

Overall, very happy with the experience: we ate well, price was ideal for the quality of food we got and it's a BYOW. The only downside was that service was very slow (and the place was pretty empty until about the time we left where it started to fill) - but to me it's not an issue. Just bring an extra bottle to pass the time."}
{"text":"A hidden gem; food was incredible, and service impeccable. From the soup to the main course and dessert, everything we put in our mouths lit up your taste buds. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A very nice old gourmet restaurant in Old St. Rose with an eclectic smaller menu cooked and presented in a francais style.  The benefit of this restaurant is the fact that it's bring your own wine!  On this evening my wife ordered a salad and soup and I had the soup and then the lamb. Soup was a creme of vegtables with squash and a nice little apple pieces to challenge the pallet!  Food was tasteful but my serving of lamb chops was on the smaller side.  Quality definitely trumped quantity which is not so bad sometimes!  The meal comes with a nice pita bread with a house made hummus and some other crunch bread!  For desert the choice of Creme Brûlée which was done very nicely!"}
