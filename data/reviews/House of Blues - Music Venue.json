{"text":"Ceasar side salad was awesome. Bleu \"Blues Burger\" was very mediocre. Dry and overdone.   All-female string band was tons of fun."}
{"text":"I love coming here to watch a concert. It is so intimate. The staff is ways friendly and fast to get you're drinks to you. I Always have had a great time here. The food is what you should expect but you are here to see a concert."}
{"text":"Zero Stars, do not go! After 1.5 hours wait our food arrived. The breakfast burrito was very under cooked, served on a cold skillet, and was promptly sent back to the \"kitchen\". Other breakfast items were also served cold when they should have been at least warm. English muffins were tough like a hockey puck. The staff from the manager on down is clueless and unapologetic. First time in my life I have had to walk out of restaurant. Didn't even wait for the bill, wasn't about to pay for any of that shit."}
{"text":"I'm not a party person, kinda a homebody actually. But I enjoyed this place a lot. The music was loud and fun, the atmosphere was great and the waiters were prompt. Not a bad experience in my book."}
{"text":"Never ever ever have breakfast here. I was a party of one and had to wait 20 min to be seated. I walked in and half the tables were empty. Epic fail."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give them a chance and they continue to disappoint.    This is geared towards the music/concert goer.  If you're not planning on standing down on the main floor, you might as well forget about any kind of sound quality.  We generally try to stand around up top as it's too crowded down on the main floor.  This time we even purchased VIP seating...you're sitting right next to the sound boards so you'd think the quality would be the best there....wrong!  We could hear the opening bands fine, but when it came to the main event, we couldn't understand a word.  And sadly, we knew most of their songs.  This has happened this year on 3 separate occasions.  Even while the bands talk in between songs, you couldn't understand a word.  And the cost of drinks is ridiculous.  Starting off at $2.50 for a bottle of water. $8.75 for a PBR.....REALLY?    I will say that every staff member we talked with was super friendly and helpful and the place was relatively clean and security was plentiful.    And why don't they open up the upstairs seating.  We saw Yellowcard there a year or so ago and sat upstairs, and it was awesome.  But alas, the upstairs is always closed off.  We spoke with other concert goers at each event, and they had the same comments on the \"lack of clean sound\" when you are off the main floor.  Pretty sad since it would be a great venue with a little care or tweaking.  Come on HOB management....get in the game!"}
{"text":"As a local I've been to the house of blues many times over the years but this particular night had me wondering if I'll ever go back again. About two months ago my friends band was playing in the restaurant area. I go to see the band and meet up with a group of friends. My friends had got there before me and already had dinner and a few rounds of drinks. I get there and meet my friends and say let's sit closer to the stage so we can see the band better and was told you can't sit right in front as that is a designated restaurant area. We were told to either sit where we were (in the back) or watch the band from the bar area (which is even further back from where we were sitting). Now I'm not sure who made up these 'rules' but it wasn't even that busy and there were plenty of tables in the restaurant for people to dine at. We waited for half a set to see if the front got busier and it didn't so we took it upon ourselves to just go ahead and sit up close in front. Well that action must have really upset management because we were not waited on for the rest of the night despite already eating and drinking up to that point. It seemed that the wait staff was told not to help our table and I found that quite petty and unprofessional. Even without getting waited on we still continued to buy drinks but we had to go to the bar instead. Why would you have bands play here if you're going to stick the people that came to see them in the back? Not impressed by any means."}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks and food, but the best place to go for shows.  If it wasn't for the concerts, I would have no desire to come back."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. Went in here at 6:00 pm before a Friday Cavs game and there was no one dining... at all. The bar was full, but even by the time we paid and left only two more groups had sat down to eat. This must be why they need to charge $15 for a simple po' boy.   Our server was very nice and the food was okay. The shrimp po' boy was tasty but the french dip was flavorless. Even the dipping sauce was plain. You can do much better in the area for the same price so I suggest you dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was at Mandalay Bay during the week of the SEMA Auto Trade show,  and stopped in for a quick dinner at HOB LV at Mandalay Bay.    May I say, the jambalaya with shrimp was one of the best dishes I have ever had, just spicy enough and loaded with protein.  You can taste the freshness and quality.    My server, Christy, cute with a tattoo sleeve, was attentive and professional.    There was a band playing during dinner on a Wednesday, and they were perfect, not too fast, not too slow.   Feel good music, feel good vibes, and the manager was cordial and genuine when I told him about my experience.    I will definitely be back every time I come to Mandalay Bay and I would recommend this place to my family and my friends."}
{"text":"Seen aq great rock concert here in late january.  I was here on the boss's coin and was told to take in some show/concerts.  Seen  \"Mr  bad to the bone \"  on a fri night george T was great.  Bar made good drinks GA tickets got up right to the front and swiched people maken runs to the bar.  I will go back when i am there in sept."}
{"text":"I went to this house of blues garbage last night and the dam place is so freaking loud. I did not enjoy it one bit all the bands sucked big time and the restrooms were dirty with piss stains all over the toilets and floors."}
{"text":"We sampled several items on the menu.  The pork sliders were great, the mushroom  burger was great --- and cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.  The fries were also quite good with a perfect crunch.  We did not really like the mashed potatoes because the potatoes tasted old.  The biggest disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken.  Though it was fried to perfection and crispy, it had no flavor--completely devoid of flavor.  If celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez really did create their menu/recipes, he forgot to taste the one he provided for the fried chicken, as no salt was included in this recipe.  Unless the staff forgot it...."}
{"text":"The city of Cleveland is very lucky to have this wonderful world class establishment in the heart of downtown, and as a part of our E. 4th Street \"Food District.\"   This Thanksgiving (in conjunction with Live Nation Cleveland), these great, charitable people sacrificed part of their Holiday--to open up their beautiful doors, and their loving hearts, at 11am to 2pm--to feed anyone and everyone who entered.  A Traditional Thanksgiving All-You-Could-Eat Buffet was served: Roast Turkey, Stuffing, Gravy, Cranberries, Sweet Potatoes, Green Beans, Dinner Rolls and Butter, Pumpkin Pie and Whipped Cream, Coffee, Sodas, and Water.  Additionally, during the feast, various local artists volunteered their time, and showcased their musical talents."}
{"text":"Lindsey was great.  We started with three people and our table grew to nine. She didn't mind and  handled it without issue."}
{"text":"Came here twice because we were staying at the Mandalay Bay... the first time was for breakfast, service was terrible... second time was for dinner a few days later. Service was still terrible, AND myself and another person in my group got food poisoning!!!  I'm guessing it was from their tater tot nacho appetizer because it was the only thing we both ate all weekend"}
{"text":"After being on the strip for the day, I wanted something comfortable and laid back for my last nights stay at the Mandalay Bay. I wanted a few drinks and to listen to some live music. The hostess just glared at us going in. She made no attempt to make eye contact. She was more concerned with texting on her cell phone. The restaurant wasn't that busy but looked fun as it was a full band with karaoke.  I asked for a table for a party of two and she just pointed and said seat yourself anywhere. We sat for about 30 minutes as waiters kept walking by. We yelled trying to get their attention. Finally, after yelling and clapping my hands at the waiter at another table who had walked past me 4 times in the 30 minutes he said he would take our order. He made sure we knew he was working past his scheduled time. I even commented that I would sit another table so I could get someone to wait on me. I watched this poor waiter serve half the restaurant while the rest of the wait staff had their own small areas that they seem to service well. After watching this for about 30 minutes, watching the manager not take care of his employees and redeploy them to take back the floor, I approached him and told him what was going on. It was obvious that he wasn't going to jump in and take his front end back.  He set a very bad example chatting on his cell phone several times while on the floor. Anyway, after two drinks I had enough. I was really disappointed and will probably never return. Hopefully the general manager will look at the development of his team and provide some coaching to his wait staff and host at the door. There is no excuse for this type of service at a 5 star hotel."}
{"text":"This place has the best suace to go with their chicken and waffles.  It's a honey siracha that has some kick to it, but not to bad.  That's the only reason I keep coming back.   My wife likes their pancakes that are huge as well as the pulled pork sandwich"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our family had to wait 45+ minutes after getting seated to get our food."}
{"text":"Ugghh like 5 different lines with no signs saying which one to go in, had to show my ticket to four different people after passing security.  Took them a solid 5 minutes to pay down the girl in front of me.  Just awful experience getting into a concert venue.  Show still isn't ready to play more than half hour after start time."}
{"text":"I hate that I let my friends convince me to eat at this place on the Strip.  Spent approx. $60 for 2 dinners and 2 beers.  The quality was just mediocre too.  Grrr...never again!"}
{"text":"The decor was too dark and too grim, not a fan. However the mac and cheese side tasted alright. I order bbq ribs as an entree. It was well done and tender but the sauce left something to be desired. The sweet potato fries were tasty! For the high price, I would *not* bother."}
{"text":"Having only eaten at the Downtown Disney HOB.  This one was far beyond that one.  The food was great, our seats were great, the band in the dining room was fun.  Had a great time.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I waiting so long for a meal. I don't blame the waitress cause I'm sure she could only do so much but we waited well over an hour for our food while 2 different sets of customers that arrived after us were served before us. After getting frustrated we left $30 on the table for the 4 beers we had during that time and the manager actually had the nerve to get mad at us for not wanting to wait for our food. Needless to say we will not be returning this place."}
{"text":"Best food and not that expensive. Wait staff super friendly and helpful. Make a point to come to this one for breakfast every time in Vegas. Drinks are awesome. And the best part. Wife likes it here so we don't have to argue about where to eat."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of the House of Blues and saw a few shows a month there. I have not been back since last September. My favorite band in the world, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers plays there every Labor Day weekend each year. Each year for the last 5 we have reserved a VIP table for the show. Each year it was an awesome experience. You could get a bottle or bar tab. It was a set price, no fuss no muss and the service was always incredible. That was until last year and their new VIP Host Natalie. It was such a bad experience unfortunately we will not be attending this year. It breaks my heart to miss the show but I will not give them a dime as long as she is in charge. We booked a $750 package which gave us a table for 4 with a few bottles or a cash value bar package and supposedly access to the Foundation Room afterwards. So first of all there was a ton of confusion when we got to the venue. She had no idea what was going on. It was a ridiculous display of ineptitude. Honestly if she was a manager in one of my stores I would not hesitate to fire her. Not only does she not know what's going on but she's arguing with and yelling at security and the staff in front of patrons. By the time we finally got to our table there was a lot of confusion about this so called \"bar tab\". We were assured by her we had a certain amount we could order from the bar. So we went on with our night and our waitress was fantastic and the show was amazing as always. Skip to the end of the night and the chaos and misery ensues. We were careful to make sure we did not exceed our allotted amount of food and drink throughout the night yet we are presented with a bill for over $200! I have been a Vegas local for over a decade and am well versed in how table service is supposed to work. This was not it. She sat there and argued with us and each time she \"did the math\" she came up with a different number. Eventually she decided to discount the bill, but all she took off was the gratuity for our waitress. Not wanting her to get screwed because her boss was an idiot we payed the extra money for her and gave her some extra in cash directly. By far the worst experience I've ever had at HOB or any venue in Vegas for that matter. We have missed lot's of good shows this year and will not get to see Roger Clyne in Vegas until she is gone. This show sees a lot of the same people year over year and I have urged all of my friends locally and out of state to not order any table service at the HOB until she is gone. Please bring back the guy and girl that used to do it because Natalie is an idiot and scamming loyal customers."}
{"text":"I went here last night for some dinner with my family. I ordered the build your own burger and got the 7 ounce angus burger with some French fries. This dinner was the worst dinner I have ever had. They took 40 minutes to get our food out and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The amount of time it took them to get the food out was ridiculous considering of the quality of the food. My burger tasted like the angus burgers you can buy at Sams Club that are microwaveable and my fries were plain, soggy and some parts of them weren't even cooked and tasted like I was just biting into a potato. They actually seemed like the exact same fries that they had at my school lunches in high school... Also their water had that chlorine taste to it. I totally regret eating there, it's not worth your money. I suggest going to any other restaurant in Mandalay Bay other than this one."}
{"text":"I was seriously impressed by my visit here considering it's other chain restaurant competitors- i.e., Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, etc. There was a live band while we dined- they weren't great, but good enough for entertaining background music that wasn't too loud, distracting, or offensive.   Most of us had burgers, quesadillas, or similar fare. We were all happy with the food- it wasn't fantastic, but good enough to make me feel like I got a decent bang for my buck. The downside was the service- our server was very busy and didn't pay a lot of attention to us.   The upside of the place was definitely the atmosphere. The ambiance differs from most Vegas restaurants and even the inside of the place looks just as cool as the outside. For a chain, it seemed like there were a lot of regulars at the bar top, which tends to be a good sign for me at least. Overall, a good experience and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times. We usually sit at the bar as we did on this visit for lunch. The bartender D'Andre was cordial and took our order. Even though the crowd was light. D'Andre was very busy filling server drink orders as well as taking care of guests at the bar. My husband and I shared a BBQ bacon  burger. It was delicious!  D'Andre knew we were splitting the burger and salad so sent out 2 plates. We didn't tell him. He just listened to our order and acted accordingly. To sum up. Food came out fast. Service was excellent. Food was above expectations. Atmosphere fun. Decor creative"}
{"text":"Not a bad joint at all. 4 of us ate dinner for just under $100. It is located in a prime spot, just off the casino floor, between the Delano and Mandalay Hotels, and just outside of the Michael Jackson \"One\" show. Another plus was, you can request a table and leave. The staff will text you when your table is ready. Very smart as it gives you time to gamble; I LOST. LOL.   My wife and daughters ordered flat bread pizza which was comparable to a flat bread pizza at BJs. I order a turkey burger which was full of flavor and surprisingly juicy. I also order a 16oz can of Oscar Blues Pale Ale.  Having the can was perfect because I was able to take it with me when I left.   The highlight of the dinner was the live music. Tony (unknown last) was the artist's name.  He was great. He had a personality that made you laugh, he included the crowd in the music and (most importantly of all) he sounded great. He knew the lyrics, his guitar play was dialed, and he was passionate about his performance.  We may return tonight to see who's playing."}
{"text":"I am never coming to a concert here ever again! I thought I was going through TSA at the airport upon entrance, except worse! First off, security would not let in my boyfriend because they said he was too intoxicated, he was far from and did not believe any of our testimonies when we said he wasn't. The security officers were incredibly rude to all of us after this incident, completely uncalled for. The rest of our party decide to go into the concert and this was when the fun began. If I didn't know any better I thought I was in a police state like 1984. A security officer was to check everyone before entering, and I mean THOROUGHLY. We could not bring in our cigarettes, gum or chapstick! I mean seriously, chapstick? I was forced to throw all of those items away. She searched every hole and crevasse of my purse and jacket like I was about to go kamikaze on the HOB. Finally, in the venue drinks were outrageously priced, bartenders were rude just the cherry on top to make the night a little worse than it was. Never again..."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised! We went for some happy hour drinks/food to tide us over before the main meal later that evening and left content. I don't remember if they even had drink specials but I do remember a Corona... pretty good stuff! I recommend one (or 10).   Took forever to get someone to our table, though. That, and some moron was at the table next to us YELLING at his cell phone for 15 minutes. Seriously? Entertaining for a minute, but straight up annoying when you realize it's not quite loud enough to eavesdrop on!  We got the seared-tuna tostadas and the basil/mozzarella flatbread. Both were pretty good. Don't expect much in the way of those tostadas though, as there are 3 that come per order and their \"tostada\" is actually a tortilla chip. Pretty tasty, but come on... I guess nobody would order it if they said it was \"seared tuna on a tortilla chip\". The flat bread was fairly big though, and better than expected.  Nothing fancy, but it hit the spot. Plus, the guy singing cover tunes was pretty good."}
{"text":"Man came here a couple years back while I was vacationing  in Vegas with some friends and it was BAD ASS! We came to see this 80's band called The Spazmatics and it was off the chain. Drinks weren't to bad and they were strong. I know my friend ordered a round of shots for everyone and the dude hooked us up with huge shots. It was a fun night of dancing drinking and then ya know Vegas is 24/7 so that only makes it better. I definately recommend you to go here especiall if you can catch the Spazmatics there. GO!!! PEACE!"}
{"text":"I love the House of Blues.. My first concert was Fergie. I've been to several concerts there. My son was in a concert there too, The Cleveland Boy Choir. It's always been a pleasant experience.  I forward to coming there again."}
{"text":"Really tasty chicken wings. The corn bread with bits of peppers was not bad. Overall good food and quick service. Recommend."}
{"text":"There should be a way to rate the restaurant and the venue separately, but I don't see one, so I'll combine them.   The concert venue: I thought the acoustics were pretty solid. I've seen a few shows and I was impressed. Drinks are insane and watered down - as expected. For one show I reserved a seat upstairs, but that was really uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend it.   The restaurant: I used to go here often with work friends and I absolutely love the decoration - awesome artwork everywhere - really well done. The service ranges from horrible (as in, did our waitress leave?) to great. The food is pretty consistent, and though I've had some great dishes (the fried chicken is awesome), some are dry or bland. All are overpriced. Desserts are good for sharing."}
{"text":"My family and I came twice during the week we were staying at the Mandalay bay hotel. The first time we sat over 10 minutes without anyone coming over, then my mom had to go up to the bar to get someone over. Finally 5 minutes later someone came Over and took our order then we never saw him again. Two nights later we decided to try it again because the food was good and we waited at our table for a server for over 5 minutes and our table was 1 out of 5 in the whole restaurant. We had terrible service and was charged for a meal we didn't even order/get, then we were told there was nothing they could do about it after charging our card (by another server because ours was too busy). Finally a manager fixed it and dropped off bill. We never saw our server after our food was dropped off. I've been a server for 6 years and am very understanding but this was awful, a manager wasn't even sent over to apologize or anything. Long story, short.. Great food, terrible service."}
{"text":"yup, it's a fiver =)  I enjoy the service and the food is good, too...after a long day bringing tourists to Vegas on vacation, I'm due for some down time my self. I enjoy some live music, a plate of baby back ribs, some sweet potato fries and a Stella...life's good.  The staff is friendly and fast, from the waiters to the bartenders, and my food is always done just like I like it.  It's a fiver...yup!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bite to eat after we found that RM Seafood was closed due to an event . We sat in the bar area and ordered several appetizers and a few beers which were very good. The waiter was great and really took care of business with us and all the tables around us. Good job.  Good Food and ambiance. The next day the breakfast was not nearly as good but I may try again if given the chance."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Free live music tonight. Great cocktails, service & atmosphere.  Really good food especially the Cajun options. See Molly or Colleen at the bar."}
{"text":"Ate there today.  Horrible experience! Service was totally absent. I gave a waiter the empty coffee carafe and he never came back.  The only thing I found good to eat was the cold shrimp and the omelet.  Most of the promised menu was absent.  No  sliders or shrimp & grits.  No chicken wings.  The meat they called prime rib was over cooked, dry and tasteless.  The entertainment was a movie for the first hour and the a few women singing - I expected a choir."}
{"text":"The House of Blues is DEFINITELY a great night time spot! I love that it is in the Heart of Downtown Cleveland, where the nightlife is extremely exciting and happening. I went to see the Who's Bad Michael Jackson Tribute Band. They were excellent! The energy was great, and the diverse compilation of people and songs brought everyone together. I loved The House of Blues.  It was clean, and sophisticated.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Attended the World Famous Gospel Brunch for the second time this year! Amazing job done by Pat with her amazing voice and all the staff. Good was great as always. Look forward to returning and sharing this experience with another group of friends!"}
{"text":"Just saw Bayside at the House of Blues, and I have to say, this place never lets me down! The drinks are a bit pricey, but not over the top. The kids are too \"scenester-ish\" but not enough to handle. The concerts are always amazing. I like this venue because this is the first and last time I will ever say this, but I enjoy the segregation. The young kids have their floor space, while us older folk (I'm only 22, but I feel like a granny when I see twelve year olds with more tattoos than my trucker grandpa) can hang by the three bar areas and enjoy a much better view. I also enjoy the fact that on those rare occasions that I can't see the stage, I can just look up at the various tv screens and watch from there for a while. The sound is always perfect, and there is a pretty cool vibe. The only concert I was bummed about was Ashlee Simpson a while back, but not because of anything wrong with the HOB...because it was Ashlee Simpson."}
{"text":"Should have paid attention to the reviews on Open Table about the lousy service, but wanted to go somewhere that my son could get something to his liking, which he did. My food was pretty good too, until I pulled an undercooked piece of chicken out of my mouth from the Jambalaya. Long story short, they took my entree off the bill. The service was terrible. There are a dozen other restaurants on this fun block of fourth street...opt for one of them for dinner."}
{"text":"Pizza was bland.  Cost of beer inexpensive.  Service was marginal."}
{"text":"The rotund man who claimed to be a manager needs a serious attitude adjustment. Very rude security and bartenders in the venue. If you want to pay to be treated like garbage while having a mediocre music experience in the armpit of Cleveland, then you definitely want to visit the House of Blues."}
{"text":"This place was way too crowded, there's no in and out, performers were okay, a lil disappointed but it was worth what I paid!"}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE with KURT!!! Just flew in and I was tired and hungry but his service made my dinner perfect with my friends. Wow I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant because of Kurt. Everything he recommended was great.  Voodoo shrimp Fish tacos Bread pudding was perfect."}
{"text":"I regularly enjoy going to Mandalay and catching a show at HOB. My recent experience with Adriana for VIP services made the night even better. It was a good deal, she took care of everything and the wait staff and food was on point, even in the midst of the show. Good view of the stage and easy to get around, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"OK. This is a karaoke review. This is just  for the HOB Rock Star  \"karaoke\" night. Monday nights.  If you are a karaoke addict AND you happen to be in Vegas in the *quieter* part of the week (Monday), you gotta try this one! It's \"karaoke\" in the sense that you have a monitor that scrolls the lyrics for you to sing. But your accompaniment is *not* a CD soundtrack, it's a live punk rock band! (a guitar player, bass player, and a drummer-- and they're pretty good too).   You stand on the 4 foot stage or the 8 foot stage (depending on if you're in the upstairs or downstairs room that night) with real spot lights, smoke and fog machines, and guys who really know what they're doing running the giant House of Blues sound panel to make you sound better than you ever thought possible.   There's been a lively crowd despite the late hours each time I've gone.  Down side is a limited song selection and they can't do key changes up or down from the standard version of any song, but you should be able to find one or two songs in your range, then you can go ascend the stage and be a rock star singing on the very same spot where some pampered *millionaire* rock star sang the night before (or even the hour before) in the House of Blues!  It's definitely a different experience doing \"Copacabana\" with a punk rock drummer...but it works just fine! (in fact a little more spirited than usual) The night I did that I got a roomfull of real-estate conventioneers bouncing around the place in a conga line. Stuck around for a while to listen to the others. Everyone was sounding pretty good that night. Despite their intimidating punk appearance the band is really good at vocally backing singers who hit a patch of song that they have trouble carrying."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast combo (eggs & hash browns). If you want toast it's an additional $3.00, kind of a rip off.    Eggs came out over-super easy, I ordered over-medium.   Hash browns were burnt on the outside, and tasted like mash potatoes on the inside! Yuck!  My sons egg and pancakes were great, until we found a 1-1/2\" black hair on his strawberry.  Neither one of us have black hair.    I came here last year, it's gone down hill in quality and up in price.   Pro: The manager and waitress were very nice and apologetic. They comp'd the meal.   It wasn't her fault, and yes I still left here a nice tip lol!"}
{"text":"I spent sunday morning in church, er sort of.  We saw Sunday Gospel and had brunch too.  man I forgot how much I loved this town.  I wanted to something different and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place and pleasant music.  Low standard food and service.  I do not recommend tacos at all."}
{"text":"The hotel/casino needs to mark the directions to H.O.B.s better. I saw one whole sign from west valet to the venue, and my titanium hip was starting to hurt. Once I found the place, the staff was friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to some great tunes without a mosh pit. I am NOT a strip eater, so I can't review the grub. I do feel like I'm in New Orleans walking and looking around. It's just about Showtime, sooooooo see ya Black Magic Women and men."}
{"text":"We stopped into House of Blues for breakfast thinking what could possibly be simpler than steak and eggs or other simple breakfast fare?   Obviously, quite a lot could be simpler, the first red flag heralding the catastrophe to come was the complete lack of anyone at the maître d' kiosk for five minutes. The food was greasy, overcooked, and completely disappointing for the price. The service was amateurish and ghastly at very best. It's probably a better gig if your enjoying a show with a couple of drinks in you."}
{"text":"Meatloaf special was good and so was the Juicy Lucy. Soup and sandwich combo was overpriced. Tiny half of a grilled cheese and cup of soup for 11 bucks. Alexandria was our waitress and was very pleasant.  One small tip for her. NEVER clear dishes until everyone is finished eating. Then don't drop a check until all plates are clear."}
{"text":"We now drive 2+ hours for concerts we want to see because the fees and prices are so outrageous. $140 for social d tickets... $35 for Pittsburgh.... $100 for Rob Zombie.... $40 for Toledo. We pay $140 For a our Riot Fest weekend!!! Yes most is the horrid Ticketmaster but greedy HOB now has VIP sections and price grades. Bring back the HOB before live nation where they cared about fans seeing shows rather than $$$. HOB please care a little more about the fans and go back to an awesome place To see a show! Clevelanders deserve more!"}
{"text":"Really nice/cool ambiance. That's about all I've got for nice things to say.  Made to wait outside for 10 mins despite restaurant being 3/4 empty.  Asked if there's a vegetarian burger and was told there IS a turkey burger (that's not actually a complaint, it's just funny... sorry turkeys, I guess you're no longer an animal.).  Waitress spilled some kind of ranch sauce ALL over the floor, my feet, my purse. Janitor comes and takes care of the floor first (?!) - then waitress tosses me some wet naps and leaves me to clean up this sh*t all over my stuff.  Barely apologizes, and doesn't take anything off the bill or anything (we just paid the whole thing and didn't argue, but you would think that's the LEAST they could do... Frigging mayo/ranch in the fabric of my shoes which are probably going to stink and be ruined now)."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick bite and had the buffalo chicken wings and pulled pork sliders.  The chicken wigs tasted old, dry and chewy. The sliders were dry and didn't taste great.  The waiter was nice but the food is terribly bad, even the coleslaw was awful!  Will not get back!"}
{"text":"We came in for happy hour and sat at the bar. Nikki was our bartender she was amazing!!  She made us great cocktails and really went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our date night. We really appreciated her!! Thanks Nikki. :)"}
{"text":"My Wife and I had lunch here for the first time in September.  The service was friendly and prompt.  I've also been to the HOB in Orlando but, never ate there.  The food was amazing.  I got the Juicy Lucy.  One of the famous Chefs own recipes.  It was the best burger I've ever had.  Simply awesome.  I've told everyone about it.  It's a MUST try.  My Wife really enjoyed her chicken sandwich.  I love the ambiance, and wall art.  Top notch.  When I go back, I will be having a Juicy Lucy and checking out Santana if he's still playing there."}
{"text":"Saw Kid Cudi & Asher Roth and they put on a great performance! The service here was another story. First off, we wanted to get table service, so after being jumped from one employee to another, we finally got into a table that had a really good overview of the stage. You'd think for the price of the table you would get equally good service. Nope. The wait staff was either understaffed, or too into the concert to keep the drinks coming. The worst part was the restroom staff. I literally never ever have been hit up for a tip before, anywhere. Until HOB, that is. After grabbing a mint i was walking over to the next available mirror/sink and the guy literally grabbed my arm (thinking I was leaving) wanting a tip. After having to actually tell him to not grab my arm, i went about washing me hands. Dropped a five in the jar and left. If he was the only one there I would not have tipped anything. After letting the staff know about the pushy attendant, they seemed to brush it off and literally did nothing. I will never go to another concert at HOB in Vegas. Great venue, awful staff."}
{"text":"Just the same as the HOB in your city.  I don't know how I got talked into going there for lunch this past Saturday, though there's absolutely nothing to complain about. The food is what you expect. And what you've had. Very corporate, very precisely portioned. I used to make fun of American tourists eating at McDonald's in Europe. Now I think I've lost that privilege. (For the record, I went to McD's because I like being served beer out of those wax paper cups. With a straw of course)  All in all, Vegas is home to many restaurants you don't have in your hometown. Try one of those instead."}
{"text":"I haven't attended many concerts in the last few years but my experience at House of Blues was fantastic. Parking, restrooms, food - even bowling in case you got there way to early - was nearby and easy so that I could relax and let NeedtoBreathe sweep my soul away. Everything came with a price tag, but at the end of the night it was soooo worth it."}
{"text":"On June 12, 2013,  We totally enjoyed our dinner spent for our last evening in Las Vegas.  The food there was exceptional and tasty.  Our waiter, Anthony Collata provided exceptional. He was terrific in checking with us throughout the meal.  Anthony was personable and knowledgeable in informing us in what was recommend.  He made our last dinner there very special and memorable.  If we return to this restaurant, we would definitely request for him to serve us.    The catfish there was the best we have ever tried.    Henry and Jenny From Hawaii"}
{"text":"I like HOB and visited the one in New Orleans before I knew there was one in Vegas.  I like this place.  It is a nice break from the Vegas sun and noise of the casinos.  This one is in Mandalay Bay, and we make the trek down to this end to eat at HOB, not because of Mandalay Bay.  The catfish nuggets and sweet potato fries are yum yum yum.  Get 'em, you'll like 'em.  We've had just about everything on the menu, even the fried chicken - very good.  You get a discount for the store and your next meal, so save your receipt!"}
{"text":"Overpriced applebees! very slow service took over 45 minutes to receive appetizer. They were out of plates to serve our meal which was burnt chicken over penne pasta for $17"}
{"text":"Love the place....Love the Southern flair  - the food, the decor the vibe. Nice place for a gumbo or a jambalaya or several round of beer before sweating it all out at the nearby Rumjungle."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast on a Friday morning. The super fuel omelet was good. The hash browns I could not eat, they tasted like cheap margarine. They serve Peets tea. They don't include any cream or honey with their tea. The service was ok at best. The waitress forgot to get my toast and do I reminded her, they brought the toast but no jam with it and  charged me for the side of toast.  One of the servers had so much facial hair with a big moustache and long full chunk of a beard that I was worried his hair will fly into my food. The atmosphere is lively with a theatrical tv playing the world cup and some people were cheering. The layout and theme of this place is very unique and charming."}
{"text":"This review is for the Foundation room bar. Views are to die for - best on the strip. Go on a Monday night when it's free. Expect to pay $10 a drink minimum. Two out of 10 of us threw up immediately after drinking rum & cokes. No other explanation other than we were roofied. Buyer beware"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE!! I went here for lunch with my family on a Thursday when the place barely had anyone in the restaurant. We sat down at 1:30 and we only got about half our food 50 min later!!! We also got a broken glass with one of the drinks. After complaining to the manager just before getting our food she didn't seem to care that much and just said \"I'll look into getting your food out\" and later said she would apply a discount. At this point I'm wondering why I should even pay when there were at most 10 tables of people in the place and  most only had 2 people at them. Then when the bill came the manager only took 25% off the bill and then had some comp tickets to a show that was later in the week when my family and I were not even going to be in town and they were also for a band that I don't even like and would never enjoy!! Towards the end I didn't see the manager anywhere in sight even when the bill came. I've never seen such poor service. I own my own business and know many restaurant owners. And we would have ended up firing some people if any business I associate with conducted themselves this way. I warn all people hungry and looking for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Oh man. Don't even know where to start. I used to come here all the time since I work in Mandalay Bay. I waiting 40 min for a quesadilla. They have people running around like chickens without heads. No one knows what the other is doing.  The person must have came back to me at least 4 times to tell me my food will be right out. When I got the food the portion was so much tinier than the last time I got it. When I bit into it, it was absolutely disgusting. Granted I ate it because I just wasted my break waiting for it but I will never be going back to eat there again."}
{"text":"Just saw Billy Idol perform here. Fantastic show. Venue is great and gives an awesome intimate feeling. Hands down my favorite music venue on the strip. The staff are friendly and helpful. Bar stuff are great and security handled situations like pros! Was particularly impressed with how a female security member handled a particular circumstance near me. I think she was English or Australian. Great team and great venue. Wunderbar all round!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, cold beer, good entertainment, but the food was horrible. We ordered a bacon wrapped meatloaf, the meatloaf was the consistency of the pigskin on a football. It just tasted wrong in your mouth. And we had a shrimp and grits. The grits was like a fried cake of cornbread, but without any flavor. Again, the consistency was horrible, & I am from Louisiana. Very very disappointed with the food but to sit and have a beer, its great ambiance!"}
{"text":"I had the bacon cheese burger and it was amazing! So was the jalapeno corn bread (not spicy). It has a fun vibe, good food.  I'm giving it three stars because my girlfriend ordered the flat bread, and it was bland, dry and overall like eating cardboard with vegi toppings.  Why she would order such a dish anyway is beyond me, but it was a poor item to have on a menu.  I reccommend going to this place, the prices are reasonable 10-20 for entrees (plus a few more expensive items)."}
{"text":"I certainly hope I was here on a really off day for our waiter.  We stopped in during happy hour and ordered two appetizers to share and a couple of beers.  Our beer bottles came, a glass was requested, and I ordered a water.  We waited and waited and waited.  Finally, the food came.  However, no small plates to accompany the food or the beer glass.  Another waiter realized, on his own accord,  that we needed plates and water, so he went to get them.  In the meantime, our original waiter came by and asked if we needed another round of beers to which I replied, \"No.  However, I'd still like a water and we need plates.\"  While that waiter said, \"oh yeah!\"  and went to go dilly-dally, the second waiter came by with waters and plates.  By this time, I wanted a second beer.  But, our waiter was nowhere to be found.  Eventually, I saw him and by this time I figured it would be best to get the check.  He came back with the check, I gave him cash and our change was returned.  However, it was the incorrect change.  So, I explained to the waiter that his tip will be off because he returned the incorrect change.  He then explained to me that he doesn't have change on him so he rounds up or down to the nearest dollar and gives bills back.  I then explained to him that he rounded in his favor not his customers' favor and therefore his tip will be off because the change was off.  A light bulb went off in his head and he finally understood.  With that he said, \"You know, I did that the other day. A guy gave me a fifty and I thought he paid me $30, and I ended up shorting him twenty bucks!\"  So, yeah, I can only hope the waiter was having a really off day.  But, after hearing him say that, I wonder.  Two stars because the happy hour specials are decent, the food was tasty, and I enjoyed the decor."}
{"text":"Really disappointed during my last trip to HOB (and I mean it will be my LAST trip).  Went on a Saturday night around 6:30 pm.  I know that that is early for Las Vegas standards, but there was no one else there.  Then they seat us in the back by the restrooms!  The menu was on the placemat.  The food was average.  This place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour. Great time there.  + dollar beers. + half off appitzers + good country singer while we were there, old school + waiters were attentive but not annoying  - kind of hokey - really loud, but what do you expect - the breakfast was good, but not great  definatly worth a happy hour trip for sure!"}
{"text":"The Crossroads at House of Blues is one of the better casual dining experiences on the Mandalay Property.  The overall experience rates as average to slightly better than average when compared to similar options in Vegas, but the good kind of average where you won't find yourself too disappointed by the experience...only wishing that it was a little better.  It's not \"on\" the Strip, but with fair prices and decent sized portions, it's not a bad place to grab a meal/snack and some drinks.  I have eaten at the House of Blues (Crossroads not the Foundation Room) twice, most recently in late 2010.  It's one of those places where the food is ok for the price and you don't have to worry about much going wrong - nothing excellent but nothing bad.  This is just my opinion, but as far as Resort on-property food options go, the House of Blues is a decent casual-affordable destination: not in the top tier but certainly not at the bottom.  I think the place is understaffed or lacks proper management, but if you can avoid going when the crowds are in, you will improve your experience exponentially.    Items I have tried include: quesadilla, jambalaya, ribs, burger, kid's pizza, and assorted appetizers and sides.  Overall, the food is average: not great but not bad.  The burgers had nice toppings (could have been put together better) and good flavor.  The ribs were a bit interesting: I appreciated the Cajun attempt but some in my group didn't like it.  Aside from this minor or major taste distraction, the ribs were also a bit dry.  The jambalaya was bland and the pieces of meat ranged from good to rubbery.  The restaurant appears to suffer from a little lack of effort or quality control.  Despite these less than flattering comments, the basic menu items aren't bad and can easily be improved with a little BBQ sauce or hot sauce.    Most people will visit because of the House of Blues \"thing\" but you'll also see your share of Mandalay guests who've never even heard of the franchise.  If you're coming with kids or seniors, I suggest you come during lunch or have an early dinner because it does get crowded during the weekends and during events.  I think it's too loud and dark for kids and most seniors, but the restaurant isn't exactly aiming for that demographic.  Both of my visits were during non-peak hours (less than 15 diners in the restaurant) and I found the service to be efficient.  Our server came by and got everything we needed, but it wasn't what you would call \"friendly\" service...YMMV.   There are a lot of casual dining options, and despite not being perfect, the House of Blues does offer Mandalay guests a nice alternative to fine dining and fast food.  The experience ranges from \"hip night spot\" to \"dead during the day\" so plan your visit according to your expectations.  There are places with worse service and worse food, so for the category that it's competing in (casual resort property dining) - I think the House of Blues is ok as long as you stick with the basics like burgers and sandwiches.  It's a solid 3 stars when compared to others in the category, but can easily be improved upon with better management and improvements to the recipes/cooking."}
{"text":"Jambalaya tasted like it was reheated from last week...not the same HOB experience I have had around the country."}
{"text":"I guess when you get this big you don't have to care anymore. I was treated like total shit from the entire staff. I was nothing but polite however, the staff went out of their way to treat me like garbage. They assume they will always be busy but they'll end like every other venue, too big for their own good.. It's just a matter of time. House of Blues will get a true lesson of what the blues truly mean. Mark my word."}
{"text":"Staff was great. They went above and beyond. Originally booked the foundation room for my wedding reception but upon review of my needs and guestlist the wedding coordinator closed the House of Blues restaurant for us to meet our needs. Food was great. Setting was awesome. Loved everything about this venue!"}
{"text":"The Voo Doo shrimp are great. My husband had the juicy lucy hamburger. He thought it was pretty good. I had the fish of the day which was red snapper. I had it blackened and it was ok. Price was average for Vegas meal. Although the meal was not a \"WoW\" dinner, I would visit again for the gospel brunch."}
{"text":"Flew in for Mastodon and Gojira and I've gotta say this place is a BEAUT Vaulted ceilings , one spectacular chandelier  centered above the main floor Love this place  Only gripe I had and actually was NOT expecting was the 14 dollar tallboys  A 2 dollar can of Pabst ..14 bucks  C'mon now  As stated previously , in many reviews I'm sure , pregame before you show  Tho I have to say , thee bartender did make an outrageously good AMF , probably the best I've ever had  Quality over quantity ..this rule does not apply to Pabst lol   Oh, by the way  The show was KILLER Soundguy was perfect"}
{"text":"I can't sing enough praises for Denise and the staff at the HOB Company Store! I called from Austin, TX, looking for certain paintings by \"Glitter Girl\" that are difficult to find. The two young women who helped me went out of their way by sending pics of the paintings that were available and answering all my questions. I was able to purchase two large paintings over the phone and have them shipped to Texas. Honestly, it was an exceptional experience, and so nice to know people care about a customer's satisfaction. Will definitely stop by the HOB next time I am in Las Vegas! Kudos again and again to Denise and her fellow HOB members!!! I am happy, Deborah Grimsley"}
{"text":"We ended our Saturday night here after dancing the night away at J-Pop Lounge just down the way. The had a live act which plays every Saturday night called Boogie Nights and it was fun.   Only downside was having to deal with the second hand smoke of the idiots near the entrance seeing as it was nearly impossible avoiding their fumes. Some people have no respect for others."}
{"text":"This review is in reference to the venue and not the restaurant.  My wife and I recently attended the Anthrax show on January 22nd 2012.  The tickets were $29 50 each plus a $10.00 convenience from Ticketmaster for this general admission show.    This was my first HOB show but I do know they have some seating and tables which we were hoping to arrive in time to get one since our old bones just can't withstand the brutality of the pit like we did in the old days.  Anyway, come to find out all of the surrounding tables were reserved only.  $200.00 for the table that included a bottle of Sky Vodka and only (4) metal heads per table.  Really...$200 table at a Anthrax show?  Ok, fine if you think that is worth it.    Now here comes the main reason for my review.  The upper seating deck was available but closed off.  We were told that it would open soon when the floor got packed.  After the first act finished sure enough it opened up but there was a charge.  What???  $10.00 more per person to sit in the upper deck seating.  Come on HOB!  We already paid to be in the venue and hardly anybody went upstairs.  As if you weren't making enough money on the bar you had to stick it to me one more time.  My complaint is if your going to charge extra for seating then do it in the advertisement for the show.  I'll pay for it.  Don't call it general admission then charge extra to sit down in the venue.  In the end I guess I should be grateful I wasn't charged $5.00 for leaning on the wall."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My $30 steak was awesome it was much better than any other fancy and expensive restaurant. I will always have there stake every time I go to mandalay bay"}
{"text":"The entertainment and atmosphere fun, however, if you want to talk to others at the table when the live band is playing...forget it you can't hear each other. I had the steak salad very good! Wait staff was nice and looked happy to be there!! Recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  We stopped after the Michael Jackson One show and had the jalapeno corn bread, a chicken quesadilla and the lobster mac&cheese.  All these dishes were fantastic!  We were pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cheesy artwork. Very corporate feel. Super expensive drinks. Meh customer service. But all the money that House of Blues has allows them to put on nice sounding shows."}
{"text":"I was just there to see Billy Idol on March 23rd, 2016; it was my first visit to the House of Blues. It's a smallish, more intimate venue which means there is not a bad seat in the house. All of the staff were very nice and friendly. The restrooms were clean, which I always appreciate. I will definitely be back, they know how to put on a show! :)"}
{"text":"Big dissappointment!    I went here with a large group of people, and our service was horrible. I really think the waiter didn't try becuase he knew he was already getting his 18% gratuity.  I had to ask for a water refill three times. wtf? (they were not busy either) The entree was horrible, and had so much peppercorn on the plate that's the only thing I could taste.  In fact, no-one in my party finished their plates, nor did they want to take the food home.  They need to step it up, bigtime."}
{"text":"I emailed the Manager Director the next day as LeAnn requested, and he ( Michael Heid) responded and said he would call me the next afternoon.   Have never heard anything more from them.   Apparently, fixing this restaurant and having satisfied customers is not on their list of priorities.. Wish I had read the yelp reviews before we spent the money on the bland, over cooked, overpriced food.   I did notice that most of the positive and very lengthy in-depth reviews are from locals??? hmmm.  I compared them to the other reviews.. Even the out of town 4/5 star reviews are not as indepth and lengthy...Makes me wonder if these locals have been asked to, or if they have been given incentives to leave this high feedback..."}
{"text":"SANTANA gets FIVE STARS!!!! And the inside concert area is like all other House of Blues. We really LOVED the concert with SANTANA.   Reason for 3 star is it is hard to rate here for the concert a five star yet the minimal food menu they offer gets a ONE STAR. One star for offering bland food.  We were not thrilled with the menu and opted to get the lobster sandwich with fries for $20+ each. IT IS BIG BREAD with a dab of their BLAND lobster salad. Literally no flavor and merely all bread. WORST offering of food at a high price I have ever experienced!! Serve the best quality options or don't bother.   It hurt to even show 3 stars on this review because if I am rating the FOOD, IT IS ONE STAR! Concert with SANTANA, 5 stars!!   Someone deeply needs to rework the menu quality. Pathetic and how can you possibly feel proud of it???? Ugh. McDonalds style is what we got at 8x the price."}
{"text":"I just hosted a birthday party at the House of Blues and I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Our server never smiled once and had such an attitude from the moment we got there even though we were a well behaved table of 6 AND a 19% gratuity was included in our bill.  When we ordered our appetizer, it was at first delivered to the table next to us. Then all night, servers walked around with plates of food seemingly guessing as to which table it belonged. We were interrupted several times with question of \"who had the cajun whatever\" and it was never anyone at our table.  The spinach dip was such a small portion it hardly filled the bottom of the bowl and the chips lacked salt and the salsa was seriously out of a jar from Save-a-lot. The corn bread was good - but the only vegetarian option were those listed above and a side of mashed potatoes which again lacked salt. The Fish and Chips were totally greasy and disgusting. My drink, when it finally arrived, was $11 which wasn't listed any where on the drink menu.  This place completely sucked and is overpriced."}
{"text":"sorry I was disappointed. First of all  Kirk Franklin is not there in person. It was 6 singers on stage singing his songs. I did enjoy the singing. I think $50.00 was too pricy. The buffet was more of a catered event, not what you see in most Las Vegas buffets. The alcoholic drinks start at $6.00. We had dishes stacked on our table at least 15 min. No I will not go again."}
{"text":"Service was a disaster, food was average and took forever to come out in a half full restaurant. We had 5 different servers.  Probably won't go back unless for just drinks and music."}
{"text":"RITA!  That is all she wrote!  Just kidding...  I felt compelled to share kudos and love for Rita today.  We spent a great evening at the HOB in Vegas with a large group of folks and Rita was our server.  She took care of us with love, humor, professionalism, and grace!  The food has always been great... in fact I was not all that hungry that night BUT Rita just blew me away with how well she treated each and every person... answering questions, running to get every little thing we needed and even dealing with breaking up the check for each couple.  She rocks!!!!  I just love great customer service and you certainly get that at the HOB in Vegas!  The gal in the gift shop rocked too!"}
{"text":"Thank you Leah for the wonderful service! Very personable and super sweet! Nothing goes better with southern food, the the hospitality! Great food recommendations Leah, your a great waitress."}
{"text":"We were totally surprised by the quality of food; all four of our entrees were (too) big and quite delicious. Our bill was $110 for four entrees and four cocktails; totally reasonable for Vegas.   The service was slow; friendly, but slow... which was weird because the restaurant wasn't very  busy; I'd say 25% capacity when we were there, but it took quite a while to get drinks or water refills."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. Pancakes were fluffy and tasty, hash browns light and perfectly cooked, eggs fresh and just right. Well, the coffee was weak but at least no bad tastes. Staying at Mandalay 3 days and we'll be back"}
{"text":"House of Blues is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  Excellent food and service and watching Rock Star Karaoke during dinner was fun.  The manager stopped by our table a few times to make sure all was good.  In all, very attentive service.  I ordered the sirloin and to my surprise, it came out cooked exactly how I wanted it!  The food was very tasty and served hot (always a plus).  The bar is well run and the bartenders know how to mix a drink correctly.  If you are in Las Vegas and are a bourbon lover like me, House of Blues stocks my favorite spirit...Woodford Reserve (Official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby).  I highly recommend it.  Most establishments do not stock this top shelf bourbon.  Had a great experience here (again) and it is always a regular stop when I am in town."}
{"text":"Chains don't normally do it for me, but this one if kind of fun, if you can forget it is a chain.  Music is always good, and it's a good place to grab a  drink and a snack... as long as you are in the mood for fried carbohydrates!"}
{"text":"I worked with Gina to make a group reservation for 19 for my birthday dinner. We started planning a little over 1 1/2 months prior to our trip. This may be why we were able to get the most fabulous private room. It felt like we were dining in a castle with a long dinner table that accommodated all of us. When we walked into this room....we knew it was going to be an awesome experience. Our servers Jackie and John were phenomenal. They interacted wonderfully with our group and we didn't want for anything. I arranged to have appetizers started when we arrived and people raved about them...especially the Voodoo Shrimp (also had basal pesto flatbread, spinach dip and cornbread). Particularly popular dinner items were jambalaya, bacon wrapped meatloaf, shrimp and grits and salads.  Thank you, Gina, Jackie, John and Chefs for making our time together as a family absolutely perfect!!"}
{"text":"All too often, we talk about Las Vegas eateries as having great food but terrible service.    Katie, at The House of Blues, gave Vegas dining a breath of fresh air.  She was the perfect level of attentive and courteous without being overbearing or obnoxious.  The experience today will make us return patrons again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I just want to say. I recently went to the joint at Hard Rock for a concert and was blown away. I was with my friend a month ago for Santana at House of Blues and was highly disappointed. He paid for a table and our waitress was Lauren, she was blonde, but but very grumpy. It was a small venue and she didn't seem to be busy but we seemed a neusciance to her.  We talked to her but she said her manager Griselda, or something was busy. We just wanted to buy another bottle but wasn't possible. At the Joint we were treated as customers. Very refreshing. I will go back. I hope Santana chooses wise and makes his residency much more professional, clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Was first in line for the Dec 20th show, Lupe Fiasco. My boyfriend and I got there about two hours early. The workers came up to us about an hour before the show with a $30 voucher for the house of blues restaurant and told us that we could go eat and they would see us at the show. We walked over to house of blues, had a great meal. All we had to pay for was the tip! Also if you spend $40 at the restaurant you get to skip the line completely.. so we added a few more things to our meal and skipped the line! Great service! Great show! Great people! Just wish I didn't live 4 hours away!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been at this establishment a number of times.   We usually order the chicken wings as an appetizer, along with the catfish fingers and sweet potato  fries.   The pizza isn't worth the time or the money.  The spinach dip with fries would be better if they ditched the potato chips and instead use pita chips.   Usually the service is fast, but last night we had to wait quite a while.   Burgers are good and the drink prices are reasonable.  All in all a good place to enjoy live music."}
{"text":"I'm not changing my review, but in fairness, after reading my post a manager from the restaurant contacted me to apologize for the food and gave me a full refund, which is pretty great. She offered me a free dinner at The House of Blues here in LA. Haven't had a chance to take her up on it, but if I do I'll report back."}
{"text":"Went to HOB to see Santana last weekend which was a great show in a small but awesome venue.I ordered the French Dip at the restaurant,it was bland but the service was freindly and prompt.My review is largely based on the music venue."}
{"text":"Went to a concert at Cleveland's House of Blues last night.  Few seats and they go fast so be prepared to stand all night. The real problem is the sound engineer. The mix was so incredibly bad that it was impossible to enjoy the music. I could hardly pick out anything in the mid-range mush, and each time the drummer hit the kick, or the keyboard or bass guitar hit some low note, which was very, very often, the whole house would shake, boom and resonate with that one overly boosted bass and sub-bass frequency.  Highs were cutting through, as they always do, but anything in the mid-range was lost in the mush. This over-amplification of the bass betrays a great or complete ignorance of psychoacoustics, and it caused physical discomfort and pain in my ears so that, when the bassist, keyboardist, and kick drum started pounding in unison, the noise was torture.  When this House of Blues fails and closes its doors, I will not be surprised. Purveyors of music who know nothing of acoustics? I think not."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Wednesday food was amazing so was the service! Not only was the food great the presentation was really nice. Had the fish sandwich  would really recommend!"}
{"text":"Shrimp PoBoy sandwich was LARGE in portion size but TINY in TASTE.  Tasteless with DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!  I will not order that again."}
{"text":"Went to go see King Diamond and had a blast. Security was nice, the staff was attentive and it was just big enough for the concert! I wished we could smoke cigarettes downstairs but it's not really a big deal. The only warning I can give is a 24 oz. can of pabst blue ribbon is 12 DOLLARS! Ridiculous and unacceptable for a beer that costs $1.50 anywhere else."}
{"text":"I like thid place.  I have seen it several times and never stopped in. I was excited when I was invited to a Halloween party here. I had a great time. The line at the bar moved farely quickly.  The staff was professional and friendly.  I should have come here sooner. The dj (Bow Wow Wow) was friendly and approachable.  On theother side was a cover band playing ,so it was fun to float between dance floors.   I definitely want to go back again. Great venue."}
{"text":"Went to a show last Wednesday.  I think the sound quality was pretty good.  I could hear well from where I was standing.  I agree that a lot of people will end up staring at someone's back.  I am 5'7\" and had my vision blocked for about half the show.  Luckily I don't really care what I'm looking at, I'm there for the music.  Drinks were expensive, which should be expected, because it's a concert venue.  Not a problem.  However, 4 dollar coat check?  Annoying.  Leave your coat in your car if you can stand the arctic chill for a few minutes, or at a nearby bar and just come back for it.  I would come back here for another show but would sit in the balcony so I know I have a good view."}
{"text":"A totally fun and friendly atmosphere! Our waitress, Tracey made whole the visit! She was so personable and offered the best recommendations."}
{"text":"Perfect greasy place to cure a hangover and that's about it."}
{"text":"Saw Metric here last night and I was really impressed.  The acoustics are fantastic and every seat has a good view.  It's a small and intimate venue--smaller than even the Pearl.   I wish that more bands would play here instead of the crappy Boulevard Pool (I seriously hate that place as a venue).  Also, they have a decent selection of ENORMOUS canned beers.  OMG, I am so hungover...."}
{"text":"Who the FUCK do these people think they are. There is NOTHING less rock and roll than this airport security checkpoint. Not one thing on earth. TSA takes notes from this place. More metal detector wands than a fucking presidential campaign rally.   Why don't you guys just strip search everyone, now THAT would be rock and roll. Embrace your inner fucking J. Edgar Hoover, you've got enough security cameras, at least make porn.  A good friend played there once and wanted to SPARE us from the other RAPING, namely, the beer prices. So he invited me and some friends back stage. SORRY THAT'S TOO ROCK AND ROLL - douchebag minimum wage security fuck standing at the backstage door says nuh uh. You ain't in the band. My friend in the band couldn't believe his ears. He was like, \"dude, I'M in the band.\"   House of Rules. Not blues. Not rock and roll. You should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame down the street next to the guys who blew up Beatles records in Shea Stadium as the Biggest Assholes in the history of popular music.   Fuck. You."}
{"text":"Came in off of a morning hunger but left so satisfied after a decent meal and great service from the bartender August who provided great service not overbearing but attentive, thanks August!!"}
{"text":"Review for Concert area only. Was here to see a great local band Moksha on Saturday. As a concert venue this place is OK. I have been to a few shows here in the past, this was my first since yelping. Ultimately there isn't anything in my book to say that's really great about the place, or that is really bad about it. Hence in the middle with 3 stars.   The venue it a bit intimate with its setup, that you can be up close. Its not really big, so crowd is together for it. Sound and lighting are both good. Drink Prices are usually average strip prices, $13 for a tall boy of Guinness extra stout isn't to bad in my book.   Ultimately if you like a band that is playing here, go see them. The venue is not going to add much to the show, but won't detract from it either."}
{"text":"Cool ambience in this place for being inside a casino. The food was pretty decent as well as the service. We went for some late night grub after a night out on the town which totally hit the spot. The place could be a bit cleaner though."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!! You must come here for the pancakes!   I had banana pancakes with stawberries on top. Everything was fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in vegas and I am pleased. I have eaten here for the past 2 breakfasts and I am so grateful with my full and happy tummy. Yesterday I was not to hungry so I got side of biscuits and gravy. THE BEST EVER I had no butter and just ate them straight, delicious. My family had chicken and waffles, fruit plate and more. The chicken and waffles did not disappoint! The chicken was fried to perfection and not too greasy. They were boneless and easy to eat with the golden brown waffles. It came with bourbon syrup, dark with a touch of booze and also hot maple syrup, yum!  Today we got the chicken waffles again-because they were so good, the steak and eggs, the white chocolate banana French toast, the rock and roll breakfast and the buttermilk pancakes. I got the banana French toast. It was delicious!! A mix of bread pudding, French toast, and banana bread, it's something totally new, innovative and tongue pleasing! However I did not even get a hint of white chocolate. Not sure if it cooked off or what because it wasn't on top nor in. But everyone else was ecstatic about their meals, the service, and the prices!   Our waiters name was Christian and he took great care of us. Constant service, filling waters, fresh coffee, asking us if we needed anything, and the food came out quick. Christian was nice and not grumpy considering it was 8 in the morning on Easter Sunday. Relatively cheap for good quality Vegas food. Great start to the day, thanks."}
{"text":"We LOVED House of Blues but it could have been because we were eating nothing but straight junk up to the point we arrived here.  The Gumbo side soup was delish   I had the Shrimp PoBoy. I felt like it lacked spice but it was tasty. Another thing is I like my pickles pickled and the resteraunt only has pickled cucumbers which is a pickle at its earliest stage.  My boyfriend had the ribs with the macaroni and cheese. Ribs were tender and mac n cheese was to die for with bread crumbs on top that give it a cruch. My cousin ordered a New York steak that was perfectly cooked medium well and the potatoes she got were creamy.   The prices are not too bad either."}
{"text":"AUSTIN WALKING CANE I LOVE YOU. Anyway, just passing through Cleveland, had dinner then came here for drinks and music. We sat in the backroom and it was empty but Austin was playing and his voice kept us around. We didn't get any food but the service was super, very attentive and drinks were generous for their servings. Happy place full of good, good peoples. Don't be deterred by sitting in the less rowdy backroom. I'm sure the front room is ok though."}
{"text":"I had never been to a House of Blues. We drove up to Cleveland from Pittsburgh to see Brandi Carlile. Whenever she tours in Pittsburgh she plays local venues that tend to be great places to see a show. As soon as I walked into the HOB I had my doubts. It was like a Planet Hollywood threw up all over the place.  I had major doubts about the set up of this venue. It is like a shoe box. There is a pit in front of the stage and then more standing room in the back by the bars (yes BARS, 2 of them to be exact, more on that later). The second tier dipped in a weird way so if you were standing in the back you felt like you were in a dungeon or basement. The acoustics were awful. They piped everything through speakers so instead of hearing actual music you hear the speaker recreation of music unless you are \"lucky\" enough to get a spot in the pit.    I hate standing room only venues because there is always some idiot who thinks s/he and their group of 8 giants can squeeze in front of you.  By the mid point of the show (which was awesome, Brandi Carlile is amazing regardless of the crappy venue) most of the audience was totally trashed (2 bars one small venue) there were three women behind me who were so wasted they were having trouble standing up. There was a group of three in front of me that had one girl who started wildly flailing her fists about when she decided to tell her boyfriend random stories and she ended up hitting not just me but also a middle aged woman standing next to me. I have never had so much beer spilled on my person by total strangers with no regard to the fact that they were spilling their drinks everywhere. During the very last song of the set an honest to god brawl broke out up near the front between some of the patrons. Cleveland, you seem like a nice city but your residents are sloppy drunks. Honestly, HOB should set some kind of drink limit because everyone there who had been drinking was sloppy. I hated this venue and will never come back. Acoustics were awful, it was so commercial it was sickening, the crowd was generally awful. I didn't partake in the food or drink so I can't comment on that but as a venue for concerts I recommend NEVER going there unless it is to see someone you absolutely love."}
{"text":"Worst place we visited our whole trip. Except for our waitress Aune.. she was BY FAR one of the BEST waitresses we had the whole trip. The food was almost unedible. We had the corned beef hash.. which tasted like it was a microwave meal. I ate the toast and that was about it. My husband had the 2 egg breakfast, the portion was small and was cold by the time we got it. The bloody mary was awful.. Our over $50 tab for 3 meals and one drink seemed ridiculous. Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this Gospel brunch. Great food but even more wonderful is the music. Huge smile. Sitting by folks from Chi Town and Canada. Feel the love. Good champ too."}
{"text":"Went to see Strange Days, the tribute band for The Doors that have Robby Krieger as the lead guitar. !! Band was awesome. We sat in the balcony and had a great seat. The drinks are very expensive so take that into account before you get there as you can't bring any drinks in from the casino. I did smell mother nature half way thru the show which was appropriate for the mood that night. Had a great time !!"}
{"text":"Caught the Dj Shadow show the sat before halloween, he killed it. Great venue. Cheap eats, not so cheap drinks. Go with the tall can and smuggle in a flask."}
{"text":"House of blues is a very intimate concert space. Your vision will be blocked for for at least a part of the show but you also might get close enough to have the artist sweat on you. Which is really, really close.  I've been to a few concerts here. It's always super crowded but the sound quality is great. The food is overpriced but I expect that if I go downtown. I would say the only con is there is always, always, always someone smoking pot. I've been to metal, alternative rock, country and orchestra events here and someone always lights up. I know it's expected at concerts but the orchestra event threw me. You would think in such a small space they would be able to locate and remove the individuals. I normally don't care but HOB's is very small and I don't want to be coughing on smoke through my shows because someone's smoking cheap weed."}
{"text":"Wow.  Either Arron Sanchez needs to do better, or the house of blues needs to stop associating themselves with a head food network chef.  This was a horrible experience.  The only positive aspect of my time here was....well actually, everything sucked.  We (my fiance and I) ordered the wild mushroom flat bread pizza for an appetizer.  1.  the mushrooms were canned and horrible. 2. The marinara was canned and not home made, and 3. the parm cheese that was on top of it, was definitely from a Craft canned Giant Eagle Purchase.    Awful.  Next.  We ordered a Juicy Lucy burger that was supposed to be a 1/2 lb.  but was nothing more then a 1/4 lb.  Not only was there no cheese in the middle of the burger (the very definition of a juicy lucy) it was over cooked and mediocre.... at best.    We will never go back here, and waste another 55$ on the worst food I have ever eaten.  If I'm going back to 4th street, I would rather go to Saigon and order the House Special Vermicelli.  Please, DO NOT GO HERE! (house of blues)"}
{"text":"The House of Blues is the worst live music venue in Las Vegas. I don't even know where to start. First I guess is the design. A venue should always have a clear line of sight to the stage. In this place, there are HUGE pillars that surround the main floor, so if you're on the other side, you're screwed. They also EXTREMELY oversell the place. When a concert is sold out, it's packed as tight as can be...yeah, you may think every general admission concert is like that right? Wrong. You have to take stairs down to actually get in the venue, and when it's full, there's people standing up the stairs. When the Joint at the Hard Rock has a sold out show, there's still plenty of room to get reasonably close to the stage, and still have room to breathe. I've never sat in the balcony, so I can't comment on that. But bottom line, if it's not sold out, ok, if it is, just stay home and don't bother. The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel usually gets much better acts anyways."}
{"text":"During our stay at Mandalay Bay this past week, my Wife and I went to House of Blues for an early dinner before our flight home. The restaurant wasn't too busy and we were seated right away.  My wife is a Bloody Mary fan and ordered the 'Morning After' which comes with a mini Hamburger and souvenir glass. My wife loved it (and she's quite a Bloody Mary critic). We both ordered the NY strip steak which was perfectly prepared and tasted great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive, The manager even stopped by to apologize for the appetizer taking a while to come out, which I honestly didn't think they took too long at all, but  they took them off the bill nonetheless.   We'll definitely be back when we return."}
{"text":"We went to House of Blues for the Gospel Brunch, which happens on Sunday mornings and we were really happy to find so close to our hotel. After getting our tickets, we went to our table, which was at the end of a long table that was filled with gentle older ladies. When we set our bags at the table, the nice ladies said to us sternly, \"This is our table. We came with a group.\" After showing them our tickets and that the seat numbers indicated that we sat there, the dear old women declared, \"No, our friends are going to sit there.\" I asked to see their tickets, saw that they were not our seats, and explained to the pleasant old folks that their seats were different from ours, and they scowled at us and snapped, \"There's more people in our group and they're our friends and they're sitting there. We have the whole table.\" By this time, a group of people heading to the buffet were gathering around to witness and smirk at the elderly ladies' bitter senility, but my girlfriend and I were getting kind of sick of it. That was when a server, Kristy (sp? she had red and blonde hair), came and tried to help us. Seeing that these rusty old dinosaurs refused to listen to reason, she offered us other seats, actually VIP seats, and gave us free cocktails ($10 each). Kristy the server took what was going to be a big disappointment from the decrepit, walking bags of bones at our table to a really enjoyable show with our own private seats at a much better location. Thanks Kristy for saving us from the crypt!"}
{"text":"Fun tourist destination. Not the best food in the world, but still pretty good. You don't go here for a great dinner you go here for fun.  Service was excellent, very friendly, very accommodating for a gluten-free diet."}
{"text":"Went on a unplanned trip to Vegas, doing some business and decided to have lunch at House of Blues. Our waiter Kitty, was off the charts: made recommendations on food and drinks, knew the menu cover to cover. He was really solid, provided info on Vegas and about House of Blues.  The good was complete five star occasion, we had an appetizer which was the shrimp and chicken for lunch. The food was awesome: well prepared, solid portions, and really good price. The service was five stars, we had a waiter and even the manager dropped over to say hello. If you have time the House of Blues is always a treat and must eat."}
{"text":"About 13 months ago I was excited to go across the country for my second Maryland Deathfest in Baltimore, MD. The line up was already stacked and it seemed like it could not get any better with bands like Impaled Nazarene, Inquisition, Doom, Cathedral, Cianide, Repugnant, and Goatsnake. I have to admit Goatsnake was a huge reason I decide to go again. Due to some issues they were unable to make the fest and I was bummed. Then the fest organizers announced that they would have a replacement band within a couple days. To every ones amazement they added Ghost.   This made perfect sense seeing that the Death/Thrash Metal band Repugnant was preforming as well. A little side note, Ghost is Repugnant. If you doubt this, check out the Swedish Indie Rock band Subvision, also the same vocalist. With Repugnant playing during Sunday afternoon, it was only right for Ghost to close out MDF 9. They took the stage early Monday morning right after midnight absolutely killed it.   Fast forward 13 months they added a Las Vegas date to their second U.S. tour since May last year.   Traffic on the way to Mandalay Bay was crazy. After downing a few beers and some green in the parking garage we literally got their just in time for the show which started at 6:30 PM. The place was already packed and 24oz cans of beer were $12. Ghost's performance was amazing. They definitely put on a show with the whole band dressed in black cloaks and good ole Papa Emeritus in his satanic pope outfit. The set was only about 35 mins but they covered most songs from their debut album. It was pretty clear that everyone come out for the Ghost. The other two bands didn't receive the same reaction from the audience and were quite boring in my opinion.   I hope they return with a headlining tour because 35 mins was just not enough. In Maryland they played everything to their name including a chilling cover of the Beatles's Here Comes the Sun.   Oh yeah, the sound was on point, good job HoB."}
{"text":"Harrison DEFINITELY added to the ambiance. We laughed and traded stories. He DEFINITELY keeps this place clean! Ariel was our bartender and we were not disappointed with our drinks! Great fun on a sunday afternoon. Hit Harrison up and say leanna and tony sent you!"}

{"text":"Just got home not to long ago from hanging out with some friends. We went to the House of Blues to see a concert for the \"wonder Girls\". They were pretty cool. My friend is more into them, but had me watch a couple of videos on youtube. In the videos the costumes were very colorful and different, yet I like it. We were up front right in front of the stage. This was my first time being there. I was about 15 to 20 minutes late since the concert started right at 6pm. The opening act was the \"2AM\" group. They were a bunch of young handsome men performing on stage, but I was too busy looking for my friend and her friend that she brought with her. We had a blast standing right in front of the stage to where we could reach out if the performers reached out. As I finally find my friend, the guy band was just finishing up. She said she was upset because I had my camera and didn't take any pics of the guys.. I was tooooo busy looking for her. Then we waited for a short period for the \"Wonder Girls\" to come out. At that time, I had to ask the security guard if it was ok to go down the stairs in front of him to be with my friend. He was kind enough to let me go. I took his pic later but it was tooo blurry!!! Then the \"Wonder Girls\" finally came out and gave a good performance. Most of the pics that I took, were a little blurry but it was ok. I even took video clips of the girls as well. Thanks to my friend, I had a good time hanging out."}
{"text":"Went to HOB to celebrate a friend's birthday party and I won't be back again. The waitress was friendly and helpful but her service was super slow.  The place wasn't crowded either. There was a 2 man band playing that was terrible. We had a party of 7 so we couldn't hear each other talk. I ordered the cornbread and when it came out it was lukewarm. The server who brought out the cornbread dropped the maple butter on the table then took his time wiping the mess up and bringing a new one.   I ordered the blackened shrimp salad it came out with 5 small shrimp and salad greens that looked like they were tossed together by a child. The dressing that came with the salad was oil. I was so glad I ordered the salad on the side. I asked for the balsamic vinaigrette which was ok. It definitely was not worth the price of $15.   It took forever for the waitress to check us out.  She never came back to check on the table. Terrible service. Not impressed and won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place has HORRIBLENESS customer service. They jam all the food customers into the bar area with one server when they've got a dozen open tables with servers.  Horrible planning for a post concert restaurant.  The live music is great Hire on servers for post concert chow; handle your business!"}
{"text":"This review is for the entertainment only.  Friday night karaoke was outstanding.   You sing on stage with a live band.  There are definitely some regulars here - the mid 50's guy with the semi-Billy Idol haircut who sang an Idol song (quite well) and a few others.  5 stars to the biker looking dude who sang \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and put Axl Rose to shame.  5 stars as well to the guy who got on stage wearing cowboy boots and big black cowboy hat.  I was expecting some straight-up honky tonk country until he invited everyone to give  him the middle finger, announced it was his birthday and then rocked Motley Crue's \"Shout at the Devil\".  There were some people that absolutely had no business being on stage, but that's how it is every night at karaoke night, no matter where you are."}
{"text":"Just came here for an event. Met president Bill Clinton here and had a photo taken with him, so I can't rate this place lower than 5 :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend invited me out last night to House of Blues at MGM.  She had free tickets to try out their new menu. I have never gone and have always wanted to so I told her to count me in!  We were greater by a friendly staff and escorted to our table. It was a little cramped for me but nothing I couldn't manage.   Our server was really fun, his name was Jason. We ordered the house salad, Cobb salad, chicken wings, and two mixed drinks served in a mason jar that we even got to keep.   The food was presented very beautifully with a great appearance. The house salad was sort of bland and boring. The Cobb salad was amazing. I loved how they placed all the items individually on the plate so you could remove the items you didn't want like the bleu cheese. It was really appetizing and delicious. The chicken wings were great! Not to spicy but had just enough of a little kick. The problem with the chicken wings was the size. They served them whole and were not cut up individually into a breast, wing, and thigh. It was totally messy! My hand were covered in sauce and I felt like a carnivore trying to rip the meat off the bones.   The atmosphere was great! A live jazzy band was playing and people were dancing. We had a great time.  I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast this morning and was pretty disappointed with the service and the food. We had to request silverware and napkins, cream for our coffee twice, and syrup even though we ordered waffles and French toast. The food lacked flavor. Although family friendly and convenient to our stay at Mandalay Bay, we would not recommend HOB"}
{"text":"If you want the House of Blues you enjoyed in 2010 or earlier, spare yourself the trip. The restaurant has a new chef who decided the menu should lose the new orleans flare for a more modern American fare (think high dollar Dennys). Totally unimaginative now."}
{"text":"Ashely R. Was the best server! We had such a good time. Soul cluckin good was the best dish, amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The House of Blues, has always been my most favorite place to watch a live concert. I've seen everyone from Incubus, Trapt, Finger 11, Seether, Modest Mouse, Erykah Badu, The Black Crowes, Crossfade, etc..  And has always been more affordable, because it really isn't a huge Venue.  and they have 3 bars attacking you from 3 sides.  Left, Right, And Behind!!  No! They don't have one on the stage. I think 3's enough!!  Other venues just charge too damned much.  Corporate Assholes!!!!  Yes Ticket Master, I mean Ticket Price Hoarders!!!!!  Hehehe!!"}
{"text":"Although small, the House of Blues music venue was nice. The smallness made it more intimate. It also had this rustic feel and I like how it was underground. It reminded me of a place I frequented when I was a lot younger and partied. I don't remember where. The bartender was friendly and the service overall was good. It made for a good atmosphere for a small concert. I hope to go back and check out another concert in the near future."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Took over 45 mins to get our food it wasn't even that busy in this restaurant. Then our food gets to our table the ribs were cold my pulled pork sliders were cold. The others we were with were not impressed with the taste or service or lack there of.   Then asked for check that took another 30 min before we received."}
{"text":"Clarification: This revue is of the House of Blues Restaurant.  Service was very good. James made sure we were always in good condition. Our food took 30 minutes to get to us...It was pretty good. A little on the pricey end for what they serve in my opinion. Highly recommend you give the waffle cut fries with melted gorgonzola cheese. I had the clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl. Nothing to call home about, but still good. Portions are big so make sure you have somewhere to store your leftovers and you wont feel so bad about the tab."}
{"text":"This is evidence that key to happiness most of the time are low expectations.  As much as I was against someone choosing this for lunch, it actually turned out to be the best place we ate the whole 3 days in Vegas.    So, do give it the right chance and enjoy both the food, service and atmosphere!    Highlights - quesadilla's, flatbreads and ahi tuna anything.  Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came for appetizers and drinks during happy hour...took 30 mins to get drinks and our queso dip and another hour to get the rest of our appetizers. ..prices were absurd for a happy hour and service was poor...food was average at best."}
{"text":"Saw a show there on Friday. It was a great performance even after part of the ceiling fell down next to me.   However,  FYI be careful when using a debit card. The bartenders ran my card three times for preauthorization holds. So after the correct amount was paid to House of Blues the holds remain until my bank releases the money. I was told by Alex in customer service that this is a standard procedure at House of Blues Cleveland and that most bars and restaurants do this. Actually,  I go to bars and restaurants often and rarely see duplicate holds of varying amounts. If it were an industry wide procedure I wouldn't have called, right?"}
{"text":"it seems that lately if you want to see a band of the up and coming nature, the house of blues is the venue that they will play at in cleveland.  especially lately.  for example, while flipping through stations aggravated the other day, i caught the \"concert watch\".  every show they mentioned said \"house of blues' as the location.  really?  wtf.  why is everyone getting booked at the house of blues?    it's not a horrible venue.  it's got eclectic decor like the rest of the chain. but i have to say:  any venue, no matter what the place, chain or otherwise, shouldn't get every.single.show.   it's just not right. it's like the mcdonald's of concert venues.  the shows there aren't bad experiences.  the sound is generally well balanced and the space itself is a good venue.  i'm just a bit upset they seem to be monopolizing the scene.  that and their drinks are astronomically priced.    house of blues, i get the vibe you're bullying all the other cleveland venues.  stop it.  play nice.  or we'll have to separate you.  though i'm still going to the shows, so who am i to say.  i can't give half stars, but i'd say this is a solid 3 1/2 stars. only cuz i'm scared they're bullying the other cleveland venues."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located in the Mandalay Bay where I'm staying.  I received a $100 voucher to use anywhere in Las Vegas and this was the perfect place.  I ordered the New York strip steak with mashed potatoes and my boyfriend ordered the Soul Cluckin Good entree that came with 2 pieces of fried chicken, mac n cheese and potatoes.  For starters we ordered garlic fries and the chicken and sausage gumbo.  Ashley Peterson was our server.  The food was just okay.  The potatoes were very bland and the steak lacked seasoning as well.  I was very disappointed.  My boyfriends chicken was good and his mac n cheese was just okay.  The garlic fries were good and the gumbo was awful...don't order that!  For the amount of money spent we were a little disappointed.  Our waitress and the manager were great though.  I would probably come here again but wouldn't be on the top of the list. I give the restaurant 3 stars for the staff and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here on a MyVegas comp. We ordered the chicken quesadilla, wings, and pulled pork sandwich.  The chicken quesadilla was lackluster and lacked any significance in both flavor and originality. It was basically cheddar and white breast chicken sandwiched between two warm tortillas. I did not see or taste any peppers, pablano chiles or onions as it was mentioned in the menu. Even the salsa could not save this app.  We chose Kansas City BBQ sauce for the wings, as it allowed only one choice of sauce for 8 wings. Again, the sauce was completely unremarkable, it was slathered in sauce yet it was neither sweet nor tangy, like a true KC sauce.  But boy was the sauce thick, it was deceiving because the actual wings was quite small and very little meat.  The pulled pork also was suppose to be KC BBQ style but again it was just a whole lot of tomato-based sauce and nothing else. The meat was, you guessed it, unremarkable.   This is definitely a chain to avoid, even at peak lunch time, the place was dead."}

{"text":"Some observations based on a recent Steel Panther Show, which my buddy and I see every year during our annual summer Vegas trip:  At most venues, doors open about an hour before the scheduled start of the show.  I don't know about other acts, but they always do doors for Panther only 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the show, so doors aren't until 11:00 p.m., for Panther.  There is no reason to get there before 11:00 and no reason to line up.  We usually chill and get drinks at the casino bar across from the HOB and stroll right in when the line is gone.  Panther tends to go on a little late anyway.   Panther's set was an the short side (about an hour) this time.  I'm not sure what's up with that."}
{"text":"This is my second concert at a HOB, and judging from the last place, the setup looks almost exactly the same.  Hmmm, maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  In any case, I had a blast because: - concert was only half full. Not crowded. - got reserved seats at the balcony, or upstairs, whatever you want to call it.  If you like standing in the pit, then get General Admission tickets. - I had the first seat, on the first row.  What does that mean? It means I was 4 feet away from 15 feet height speakers!  My ears survived!  And I could dance in the space and hold on to the railings. - my first stay at Delano was a big plus! Highly recommend booking a room at Delano or Mandalay Bay...  you won't need to drive if you happen to get wasted. - smaller, intimate setting.  Place probably holds about 1500, as opposed to 10k or 20k crowd frenzies.  Drinks - a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, good service.  We had both lunch and dinner there, and were served dinner by Jason, a fine young man who provided us with great service and a big smile!"}
{"text":"This is positively the worst venue anyone could ever experience.  The security is ridiculously over the top. They make their presence extremely known--and for no reason whatsoever.  They don't even allow dancing if you have seats in the balcony. In fact, standing up will get you harassed.  As a paying customer being constantly interrupted from the music/performance completely ruins the experience.   To make matters worse,  the sound system is horrible.  The sound cut out at least a dozen times in the less than 2 hours that the performance lasted. What a joke of a venue.  See the performance somewhere else. It's just not worth the annoyance and frustration."}
{"text":"Watched Dita Von Tease at House of Blues. May 17th 2012 : The show started 20 minutes late, since it is standing room only tickets at $45-55 a pop and we had to arrive at least 30 minutes early so it is not very pleasant. A total of 50 minutes standing time and some audiences were sitting on the dirty floor... Once the show started it was disappointing and not worth the wait at all. What a waste of life and time this was! I didn't know a fat woman twirling nipple tassels is entertainment!? The MC told us the more we drank the better the show becomes and prettier the women too. I understand HOB started the show late so they can sell more drinks, but it is not fair to the audiences. Only thing nice about that place is the chandelier, I had the chance to stare at it for 50 minutes."}
{"text":"well tracy is amazing! very personable and gives great advice. she went out of her way to help us. shell be why we come back :]  food is great as well. love the holiday decorations!"}
{"text":"The inside is fun and inviting. The food was equivalent to Applebee's. I got a champagne cocktail and the champagne was flat. Better places to go."}
{"text":"Came Friday night and had a great time at Michael franti concert. The venue, employees and atmosphere were great! Came back Saturday morning for breakfast and was very disappointed. Food service was slow and order eventually came incorrect. Food itself was one star, Denny's quality food...blech! Summary- come for music atmosphere and drinks but don't eat the food."}
{"text":"Lisa D.. not sure why you would say that the company has disgruntled ex-employees. If it were my company I wouldn't want the world knowing how employees aren't getting along. Before you log onto yelp for one time & write your ONE review, just realize you are doing the same thing... so in other words I could say it's quite sad how yelp is now a place for business workers to go on here & write a five star review just to say how another person's REAL review was not correct.  I've have had food here more than enough BUT it's not consistent. However, when it's good, it's good. So for that two starts will suffice."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are good.   Mostly for the honey Sriracha sauce.  The pancakes are huge.  Really one person can only eat one pancake, which is not a bad thing.  Service was decent.  Have had the Cobb salad and pork sandwich on other visits and felt they were of good quality."}
{"text":"It has been 10 years since I attend HOB Gospel Brunch and I took my friend who had never attended and we were both blown away. Now there are some glitches but first the outstanding points:  1. The food - it is yummy Southern home cooking - from the waffles to the made-to-order omelet station to prime rib to huge already peeled shrimp. The coffee is good as well as the mimosas.  The bread pudding was to die for - and there were plenty of salads, sides and I really loved the Mac and Cheese.  2. The music - it is unbelievable - the energy, the love, the power. It inspires me and I didn't want it to end. The show is interactive and you just want to get up and dance.  3. The atmosphere - you can carry on a conversation and still enjoy the music. You do sit family style and meet some very nice people. Com'n it is like going to church - you really don't need your own table.  Now the glitches: 1. Seating - originally I was seated at a table designed for 2 which had 2 additional chairs added to make it seating for 4. Once the drinks were brought, I knew I would be eating off my lap. I did look around and saw some empty seating (this was 1:30 so everyone had been admitted) and they did move me. However, seating for 2 is seating for 2 - at $40 a person, who wants to eat holding their plate or off their lap.  2.Service - now this is not the servers' fault - everyone was moving - more help is needed. I had to have my friend go to the bar to get our refills and the plates stacked up at our table of 8. Again, I am not faulting the staff - HOB - you need to add a few more - even part-time.  3. The Wait - be prepared to wait with long lines. I loved the waffles but it was truly the longest wait I ever had for waffles.   I would still go back - I did give it 4 stars - but be prepared for long lines and see about sitting on the main floor instead of the second level."}
{"text":"This place is amazing..the atmosphere is great, people are fun! My only complaint is they close WAY TOO EARLY! Come on..this is Vegas. I hope they expand their hours. 3AM is good.... Thank goodness Ri Ra was open super late to accomodate us. :)  However, they have the best bread pudding I've ever had.."}
{"text":"Great place to see a concert.  Good views from most anywhere.  The one thing that keeps me from giving them a fourth star...the drinks prices are insane.  Listen, I have seen a lot of concerts at various venues and I understand they want people to drink, but $8 for a little plastic cup of alcohol that    is barely big enough to hold all the excessive ice they cram into the cup, which leaves little room for the actual drink.  Come on guys, we like to have some drinks with our rock n' roll, not go broke."}
{"text":"This is so far from my favorite music venue.  As far as big acts go, it is kind of nice to see them here instead of somewhere like The Q, but it's still pretty impersonal and way too expensive. I always get super disappointed when my favorite artists come to town and end up here, whether they book here initially or the show gets moved from somewhere cool like Beachland and I'm forced to go to HoB since I already bought tickets. Blegh."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Came here a few months ago and tried the Turkey Burger & oh my God 5 stars!! Tried the breakfast today and once again 5 Stars!!! Our waitress Ruth was very helpful and really went out of her way to make our experience wonderful. Will definitely stop here every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to House of Blues for happy hour. They had great  small plate specials.  Popcorn shrimp was amazing,  as were  the street tacos and sliders. Our server, Jenny, was very personable, efficient and had a wonderful sense of humor. She really made our visit a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Great venue for a wedding reception. Food was above average (several stations that included salmon & asparagus, pulled pork, jambalaya), staff was kind & almost too efficient (taking our drinks away too soon), sound system was a tad loud for my taste.   Knocked down a star because of the horrible sewer gas smell upon entering the Euclid Ave lobby. Surely they could fix that?!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up a grilled cheese? I don't know but this place did. It smelled like fish! The fries were mediocre, but at least they smelled like fries. Plan to go elsewhere to eat after you see a show here."}
{"text":"Sunday gospel brunch....skip it.  It's $50 for a buffet brunch (with \"southern food\") and a 45 minute gospel show. The food is just ok - plentiful, but lacking in flavor and, well, soul. Most of what I sampled (including egg dishes, fried chicken, roasted pork and salad) was blah. The two standout dishes were cheese grits and - would you believe it? - a rice krispy treat, and I can make both of those at home! The price includes all-you-can-drink mimosas and bloody marys, but they're watered down.  As for the entertainment, that's the real reason I wanted to go here - I love gospel music. The performers are talented, but the acoustics in House of  Blues are TERRIBLE! We had to move from our table on the lower level to the balcony, just to be able to understand half of what they were singing. The music is way too loud and the singers are shouting, and yet you still can't hear them. The balcony was marginally better, but even then the quality just wasn't there. I hope they can make some adjustments so future guests can actually hear the singers."}
{"text":"We went 2 times!  Great place - Eggs Benny was great! Our waitress was super sweet her name was Aunu. ( I believe- the Blue hair girl).  Super fun!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"We atended the Gospel brunch last Sunday. The food and service was very good, but the entertainment was disappointing.  Instead of a gospel choir, there were five women and one man.  A lot of time was spent on a birthday/anniversary segment that lasted far too long. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Mandalay bay and looking for a grwt place to wat breakfast, someone recommend the hojse of blues. We went with no expectation and i enedes up to be amazing!! Great service, super nice, great atmosphere. The food was great. Tons of food for a little price. Great place for kids too!!!"}
{"text":"Best southern food on the strip. Check their live music schedule so you can plan ahead, and make reservations. It's a total blast, and the hospitality is impeccable. Try the jambalaya and the chicken breast from the gluten free menu! Yum."}
{"text":"Make sure you're not in a hurry! Good sound with very good musicians. Good prices but they lose it with poor, did I say poor, service.  I'd give no stars if I could. Ordered from the bar menu, 20 minutes for a beer, 50 minutes for the food! Really! They've been in operation for how long??? Server blamed it on the kitchen-threw them under the bus..."}
{"text":"Food Review Only  I thought this place was just ok. We did not eat anything the whole day so by 5 o'clock we just wanted to eat something. That and $5 happy hour sounded good.  We shared their happy hour appitizers and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Their appitizers tasted like appitizers you could find at Applebees, good but not spectacular. Their pulled pork sandwich was ok. The meat tasted good, but their sauce was too sweet for me. I like my sauce spicy.  Next time I come here I would rather go to a show.  Zipzap Zubidy Bop!"}
{"text":"FOOD REVIEW ONLY  Breakfast at HOB is good, depending on what you order.  My friend was very disappointed with her biscuits and gravy, which for some reason had ham incorporated into the gravy.  I had a typical bacon, eggs and hash brown meal and it was fine.  Service was good and the coffee was excellent."}
{"text":"Love the HOB.... but Gina & the Eastern Black? Thanks, but NO THANKS Gina. Horrible opener for Steel Panther! NOT WORTHY."}
{"text":"Best venue for concerts. No bad seat in the house. I always love to come here. Even with big name acts, prices are excellent especially with such close proximity. Always a better venue than the big overpriced arenas."}
{"text":"I have to review this place, because they gave us such great service they deserve a good review. We came here for the game on Sunday. It was happy hour and all beers were $1, appetizers half off, and DonQ rum drinks  (which turns out to be really good) were $3. You can't beat that! My girlfriend and I consumed two pounds of wings without any help from our husbands. yikes! Yes, they were good. We initially had ordered 1 plate of wings and a spinach dip appetizer. The spinach dip was so bad. No one even took a second bite. Even though it would have only been $5 gone to waste we had to send it back because we were at a tiny little cocktail table and it was taking up too much space. I have to say, I have never seen a restaurant so cool about a patron sending something back. It was almost embarrassing how apologetic and attentive they were from that moment forward. They asked us what we wanted to replace is with. That's when the 2nd plate of wings came in. : / Three people came to check on us several times throughout the rest of our time there. Everyone was so nice. My drinks had the perfect ratio of rum and diet. Our bill came out to $34. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Really great service. I had the classic bleu salad and it was delicious. Very simple and some what on the small side but that's what I wanted. I'll also note that I didn't finish it so if you're looking for something small but filling in Vegas get it. The bacon was very tasty. I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it coming from Canada ( high standards on bacon LOL I KID ) My friend really loved her buffalo chicken salad but the portion size was a little on the large side for her. The waiter made sure to fill my water up every time it was almost gone leaving me now thirsty. I give this place five stars!"}
{"text":"We came here to watch Santana and my husband I absolutely loved every minute of his show. We were in the standing area and stood for two hours and didn't realize it because he knows how to entertain.   The ambiance and energy in the building is what it should be like at every event.  The folks who worked there were all cool starting from the ticket booth, security, bartenders and servers.  Great all around experience and would go to another concert here anytime."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night before we saw Steel Panther in their venue space.  It's not a place that I would have chose, but this was a group situation.  We had a side room for our group of 12+ and the service was okay, not great.  Being in any side room, it's hard to flag down your waiter or waitress if you need something.  My main complaint is that I ordered the Yummy Chicken and it wasn't yummy.  :-(  It was really spicy and that wasn't in the menu description.  I probably should have ordered a burger or sandwich, but I wanted an entree for dinner.  i would have sent it back if I wasn't with a big group.  I just didn't want to make a big deal of it, so my man shared some of his food with me which was just okay.  I'm sad to see that it's Chef Aaron Sanchez running this restaurant because I like him on TV.  STEEL PANTHER:  Fun overall, but we didn't like the opening band that night at all.  The opener took way too long and I didn't know that Steel Panther's actual show would be so looooong.  Our group of friends at the show (maybe 10 of us?), only 4 of us made it to the end of the show.  I know, we're getting old (in our 30s)... but the show was kind of dragged out.  The venue was good, but the drinks were expensive.  I don't think I would want to see another show here.  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11"}
{"text":"I want to talk about what went well at the house of Blues instead of focusing on the bad.   The host got us a seat at the bar because we where short on time (Micheal Jackson One tickets). Eventually Jason was our bartender. I say eventually because he had to come from the other side of the bar when he noticed us failing epicly to get the attention of Jillian, the bartender working right in front of us avoiding eye contact at all cost. Jason was attentive and friendly. Everything Jillian was not. My wife tried to get her attention 5 times with no response. I assumed it was loud and my wife doesn't have a commanding voice. So I tried twice before she just walked away. My voice is very commanding.  She didn't speak to us until we where almost complete with our meal. I think the reason was because her name was on the ticket and she thought she was getting a tip... Haha not this guy. I tipped Jason in cash.   The dinner ended with Jason talking to the manager to provide me with a 25% military discount on my meal. Overall a great experience. Jillian should probably find a different occupation if being friendly is not something she likes to do.   The show is starting, Jason is awesome, Jillian is not. House of blues is awesome and so is the food."}
{"text":"I've contacted Sasha/business rep per her reply to my review. I've recd no response. At this point there's no point to discuss anything further."}
{"text":"Fun bar, unique 'Dusk til Dawn' decor & different atmosphere.  Twice for HH recently & I've been here a decade ago to see Kayne perform.  One entrance is the restaurant/bar & other is the concert area.  Love that they have KJ Chardonnay on HH & a nice selection. The couple next to us had three menu items & only liked the Popcorn Shrimp.  I'm not really a fan of popcorn shrimp so I ordered the SW Quesadillas... horrible!  They were full of mushy veggies.  It was also tiny so if I EVER order them again, it will be w/ cheese only.  Hopefully, they change a few food items on the HH menu cause nothing really seems appetizing to me on it.  Both bartenders we had were great, both times."}
{"text":"I was in LV for my sisters wedding and decided to check this place out by myself and had a blast to say the least lol. People seem to be so much nicer when youre out of town on vacation. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross food. GROSS FOOD. Awesome venue though. The menu is small and it sucks, and the service is terrible - but the venue is small and a bar wraps all the way around so people have easy access to drinks and there's no long lines. Go for the concert, and eat at the Burger Bar in Mandalay Shops (towards Luxor)."}
{"text":"This is a really cute placeit's something different.   I had the watermelon spritzer, very sweet, but good if you like watermelon. They refill it for you too  voodoo shrimp - i usually never eat shrimp, but our waitress recommend this so i had to try it. It was really good, jumbo size shrimp smothered with tasty seasoning over corn bread that melts in your mouth!  gumbo - its thick and gooey it was decent. Tasted way better with hot sauce :)  baby back ribs -  literally fell off the bone... it was delish! it also came with cold slaw, beans, and corn. mmMMm the corn was good up until i dropped it :( But my sweet server saw the whole entire incident and fired up a new one for me right away!  Lastly, we had the field of greens... the portion was smaller than the ribs, but that's okay. every bite was yum :)"}
{"text":"Wonderfully small, intimate venue, but beware of the loge seats. If you can get a table on the floor or are willing to stand for a show, you will love this space. The sound is great, the vibe and energy are great.  The seats in the 200s, however, are ALL at least slightly obstructed view because of the railing. In particular, if the only seats you can get are in section 200 or 208, then skip the show. I'm not kidding -- just don't waste your money on section 200 or 208."}
{"text":"The food here is decent...maybe a bit mediocre. I like the variety on the menu but the execution was not quite as good. The ambience is nice, but of course you're sitting at the House of Blues!   I tried the lobster mac n' cheese and it was good. The lobster was quite flavorless and could have been crab for all I knew, but the mac n' cheese was darn yummy and I could have eaten it all by myself. Except I also split it with my coworker along with a cajun jambalaya...which was quite disappointing. And a little dry and not spicy.  I would come back for a show, but never for food."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Food was great but a little slow.  A little pricey, but what isn't on the strip?  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went to see Raekwan, ghostface kills and Mob Deep.  The night was pop'n. I had such a great time I'm not even sure if I made it to their performance.    The drinks were not the best tasting but was strong.  If you have a chance to eat before you get in I'd advise to do so.  The pizza was not that great even when I was a little buzzed."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour. The specials were nothing to write home about and the service was slow. We got nachos to share which were very plain jane. I don't even think we finished 1/4 of the plate. Very limited choices behind the bar - even if you're willing to step away from the HH menu. A means to an end but not worth searching out. Great for tourists though."}
{"text":"I have come to this place every time I have come to Vegas and have not yet been disappointed it's always a great turn out."}
{"text":"Oh the memories I have here!  Grateful to have experienced well over 25 concerts at HOB.  Love the decor and ambiance.  Yeah, drink prices suck here and all over the strip.  This place gets packed real quick for a popular band, so get there early to stake your spot.  Security is tight, so leave your electric nipple clamps in your car.  Rock on my babies!  /m\"}
{"text":"The food is very good, and I have been to many shows here. The venue is very nice. Priced fairly although that is sometimes out of the control of HOB. Visit, you will not regret it"}
{"text":"Excellent Jambalaya and the chicken is awesome too. Don't forget to check out the entertainment."}
{"text":"Don't complain about having to pay 9$ for a tall boy they will cut you off.  Worst venue I've ever been to."}
{"text":"One of our first drinking stops the Sunday we got into Vegas . . . I was still under the weather, but damn it, it was my vacation, and it was a rock joint, so a whiskey drink it was - bartender makes a fine Manhattan.  Word to the (un)wise - alcohol consumption doesn't really affect your cold one bit.  Just alternate Airborne and Emergen-C and you'll be fine.  My cold cleared up the next day because I attacked it with electrolytes and booze.  And blues.  My one regret is that we missed the Prince show later that night, but we had many miles to go before we slept . . ."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great. Our food cane out in a timely manor. Our food was great. But it was all a bit too salty. There was 4 of us with appetizers, meals, and drinks. Just a bit too much salt on most everything. Food was very comfort like and heavy. Because we showed our receipt, we got into the show with our tickets easier than waiting in line. :)"}
{"text":"Went to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Could not understand what the actors on stage were saying. Sound was distorted. When the movie was playing. Sound was also distorted. Picture quality was poor too. We sat in the balcony. It was hot, and no air circulation! Outside temperatures were in the 50s. Venue was less than half full. So no excuse for the venue to be hot. Mandalay Bay is to cheap to air condition, or replace the worn out carpets. Many walked out of the show before the half way point. Drink prices were outrages! Soda $5.00 for small cup, $11.00 to $14.00 for a beer, and mixed drinks $18.00! Awful rip-off venue. Last time we go here!"}
{"text":"There is no denying the atmosphere was pretty cool. The food was not so great. We had the breakfast menu, which had a really good selection but the meals left something to be desired. In my expert opinion ( and by expert I mean I eat food), here are the things that could be improved; Hash browns; very generous portion but cold and kinda mushy. Less potato and more crisp would be good. Chicken and waffles; waffles were great, chicken strips were REALLY bad. Under seasoned and horribly tough. My daughter ate them, I thought they were inedible. Breakfast burger; OK. Kinda blah. Could have been seasoned better. Egg white burrito; Pretty tasty, better than expected actually. Creole Bloody Mary; Surprisingly not great, just salty, not much flavor. Easily corrected with more lime. Service was decent."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, was with 3 other people.  On the burgers; buns not fresh, need more flavor.  Fries were blah, although friends said the sweet potato fries were good.  Service was mediocre, and the place was dirty, and this was a regular Thursday night, so it not slammed with people at all."}
{"text":"New menu launched yesterday.  Unimpressive. Don't waste your evening at HOB when there are countless other establishments on this hustling walking street in downtown Cleveland.  Fish tacos - well let's just say that they are a far cry from an authentic mahi mahi taco you would get in Southern California or Baja.  The first thing we heard while being seated at 8:40pm - was a server walking by the hostess saying - \"you know we are closing in 20 minutes\" -- hmmm, not a very good first impression.    The place was empty.  TVs are bolted to almost every wall but they only scroll advertisements - why have TVs if you cannot tune to a sports game or CNN or ??  - who wants to watch the same three or four scrolling ads?"}
{"text":"Just some average food. Let's be honest if you are eating here its because you just want something quick or casual. Nothing bad, just average. The waitress we had though was good. Quick, helpful, and did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"We wandered in for lunch one afternoon and we pleased with the fast service and the tasty sandwiches served with a cute little variety of specialty sauces for your fries and/or your sandwich.  Fries served in a cup a little novel and it does prevent you from the sea of fries so many places serve.  The cool thing was they want to keep you coming back in so if you show your receipt you can get a two for one breakfast the next day.  Listen, this is one of the better deals around as we all know the slots machines don't have it.  At any rate, we did go back for breakfast, which was also tasty and then they told us that we would get 10 percent off in the gift shop with our receipt.  They are the king of deals at this place and it seems to be working for them as the place was packed in the morning with people who had eaten there yesterday.  Nice strategy, House of Blues.  I, of course, would like to come back sometime and see a show here.    I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"The House of Blues has a venue with seating for approximately 2000.  The sound quality was fantastic and the space was still small enough to feel intimate.  Drink service was on point and servers were very friendly. Carlos Santana and his band were all exceptional. Mr. Santana was front and center for the entire concert filling the room with his one of a kind legendary guitar skills. Lady Drummer was simply amazing. The two male vocals added more beauty to the concert with their amazing vocals. There are not enough words to describe how fantastic this concert was.  Thank you for a great night!! The average age of the audience was over forty and Not a single person remained seated.  Entire audience brought to their feet dancing. What an unforgettable night and concert.  Kudos to Carlos Santana and his amazing band!!"}
{"text":"Gospel Brunch  I have been to the Gospel Brunch in Vegas at the House of Blues 5 or 6 times.  The shows are always outstanding but this one on Dec 31st was the best.  The spirit in the room was amazing.  The food was good but could have been hotter. I will still go again.  We even bought one of the CDs at the end."}
{"text":"My, now wife and I, had our wedding at house of blues last night. If anyone is on the fence and ever thinking \"hmmm...maybe we should have our wedding at the house of blues?\"...DO IT! Wow, first of all, from the start you're treated like royalty. We were fortunate enough to have the wonderful, calm and amazing Jen R. help us through the entire planning process. She's so cool and collected, and honestly makes you feel reassured from the first day on through the wedding. Also, she assembles a team of absolute rock stars! Mel, Terri coordinate the wedding operations and manage the wedding craziness - oh - and don't think there won't be, because there will. Let me tell you, these three ladies absolutely nail it like true professionals. Never once do you feel like they don't have a clue what they were doing. Lastly, should you have your wedding here, I can assure you that your guests will all Tell you that this is the best wedding ever. It's unique, fun and high energy. Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the HOB in Las Vegas and is based on the venue only (not food).  The venue is very different from the L.A. location.   I have to share that this was an excellent customer experience.  I say this because every staff member from the gift shop, those directing the crowd to the box office were friendly with the right attitudes and helpful in every way.    Regardless of where you are seated, you get a decent view and concert experience.  I was seated in the balcony on the far right side close to the wall.  Clever and conveniently, both sides of the \"basement\" concert area are flanked by cocktail bars.  I didn't have to walk all the way downstairs to order my drinks. I was just a few feet away.       Husband and I came here to listen to the smooth sounds of Santana (which by the way had phenomenal bass, guitar and drum performances). I had a customer service issue with Ticketmaster while being on hold forever.  It was so easy to call HOB and actually reach a human being rather than being subjected to another annoying automated call with prompts leading you to nowhere.  I was connected right away to Howard at the ticketing office.  I want to give special thanks to him for restoring my faith that there are still professionals who believe in making the customer experience a positive one.  I'm so appreciative of his understanding and quick resolution to the problem without added drama.   I would definitely come back here for future events and recommend checking this venue out if you want to see any concert.   I'm a fan of House of Blues!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there last week for a huge trade show, and our software company threw a big bash there, and took over the entire place.  There were some really great appetizers, many tray passed, and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  Service seemed pretty good considering the crowd."}
{"text":"Went got the Gospel Brunch - worth checking out. All you can eat brunch with emphasis on Southern specialties, i.e. Chicken & Waffles! The food is worth the cost of admission alone. Music & entertainment were good. Only low point as the mimosas, seemed weak & warm. Still worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Yup, The House Of Blues has it going on with all the show varieties. Parking is plentiful, but as you know its at your own expense even if you come to a show. I was truly impressed as to how clean and put together it all looked. To bad they don't validate the parking ticket to at least half the cost that would have sure made all the difference in my experience. The staff from the box-office to the Bartenders where good people and fast. Today I get to watch George Clinton in all his glory.   The opening act for GC was amazing tonight she was fantastic and had incredible vocal cords. The only thing that was a huge disappointment was that it took about 30min for the set up between acts."}
{"text":"Welp....... Came last week and sat at the bar ( was here for work so I came alone)     waited 20+ minutes to be given a menu even tho the two male bartenders acknowledged that I was there.....   They were Not friendly at all... Ordered a salad and a water and my visit was over an hour!!!!!!  Food was amazing but experience was not...    Now,  I'm back again with my fiance,  we waited 15 minutes for the water we ordered.... And now have been waiting 37 for our food... Not happy, again..."}
{"text":"I visited for breakfast and Angel was our server. Atmosphere was easy and relaxing. Angel was spot on with everything - very professional and friendly. I ordered chicken and waffles. Presentation was excellent and enhanced my desire to eat. Waffles were very light and had good taste without syrup. Chicken breading was perfect! Not greasy at all, clung to chicken very well and was moist & tender. Portions run large. The food was excellent, but Angel made it a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable.   Great food and great atmosphere. Every meal we had was cooked perfectly.  Great wait staff...very attentive and accomodating.  Pablo is the man...el hefe.  Had a Bloody  Verde BLT cocktail with a tomatillo garlic base with a pepper vodka.  Great drink with my eggs benedict."}
{"text":"This a review of the Sunday gospel brunch only. Save your $42. The food was atrocious, especially the breakfast dishes. Eggs were cold, bacon was greasy and bagels were stale. But most disappointing was the music. The gospel singers were off key during much of the numbers and were mediocre at best, plus the acoustics were terrible."}
{"text":"Definitely did not disappoint I'm from California thought it was going to be a little different since the original one is in my hometown but come to surprise it was good place good music good entertainment and a lot of beautiful ladies"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at this place. You always get a good value for your money. So far each staff member is professional and welcoming."}
{"text":"Very Vegasy, very loungy place. Food is reasonably good, prices are reasonable for Vegas, entertainment varies :) Cool atmosphere, very relaxing and chill place. Recommend."}
{"text":"Took my mother to Gospel Brunch today. We had chicken & waffles, omelets, biscuits & gravy, salad, bacon, macaroni & cheese, ribs and bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was lukewarm or ice cold, including a brand new tray of chicken for the chicken & waffles. He just put it down and I went straight to my table after grabbing some and it was cold!   Biscuits & gravy, Mac n cheese, bacon & ribs were lukewarm as well. Salad was seasoned well but not fresh.  The bread pudding was warm but the sauce for it was pretty much empty.   The omelet station was the winner (it was hot). You grab the ingredients and place them in a little cup & give it to the omelet guys. They were an awesome team (cleaning the station while the other adds the eggs to the pan) and had my omelet made in no time.  The gospel itself was fantastic! Their voices were beautiful & the lead (Patti) was very energetic and wonderful at keeping the crowds attention.  I give a 1 star for the overall quality of food, it was far too cold. I feel like the health department should stop by, my mother and I  did not feel safe eating the food and were worried we might get sick later (neither of us did). That's just not a feeling one should have after eating. The banquet department at the hotel might be able to give you some tips on how to keep food warm and refreshing the salad as it runs low instead of making a big plate of it and letting it sit & get soggy would help. Things running out (like the bread pudding sauce) is not acceptable. These are all things that should be taken care of, not something for people to put in reviews.  The coffee was lukewarm, we even noticed other tables sending coffee back. Making the coffee at time of show instead of 30 minutes or 1 hour prior to show time would fix this.  I give five stars for the gospel. Wonderful, uplifting and fun.  Stay away from Table Fourteen, there's a fan right above it, which turns already lukewarm food to ice cold in minutes. The tables could be spaced a little more apart. From table 14 & the table to its right it was too close, I had an inner seat and when I went to get more food I disturbed the guest next to me to get out (she had to stop eating and get up so I could pass).  I have no complaints about the bussers, there was always someone clearing the tables and no plates were stacked on our table at any one time.  I would not return until the reviews are better and quality of food is fixed."}
{"text":"Nobody in my crew was impressed by this place, in fact one quote was \"the salad was the best thing I ate\"  I ordered the Jambalaya, and the list of other items included the pork ribs, lobster mac and cheese and french dip.  The 325 pound man who ordered the ribs disliked them so much he passed them around to the table and went to another restaurant for his meal after we were done, he also said the beans were the worst thing he has ever eaten in a restaurant, and he is by no means a complainer.  My jambalaya portion was frankly insulting for the 18.99 I paid for it and not that great.  I have never ordered Jambalaya and not had some to take home, but I literally could have finished the portion in 3 minutes had I been really hungry, and it was no where near as good most other Jambalayas I have eaten.  When the manager came over to ask how everything was, big mistake, the honesty flew, he then tried to say that the menu was created by world renown chef Aaron Sanchez like that was going to magically make my portion bigger and the food taste better, I've met Aaron and if that Jambalaya is really how it should have tasted then I flat out dont think hes that great of a chef, but I doubt thats the case.  in the end our server did take the ribs off the ticket and our server was awesome and so was the band that was on stage.  We should have come in for some drinks and music and gone elsewhere to eat.  I wont be going back for food unless its free."}
{"text":"This review is for the concert venue only. I bought VIP seating at a table for Joe Walsh and it was well worth it. We had an attentive server who took great care of us all evening. We didn't have to show up early, and there was no jockeying for a view of the stage. The tables are elevated enough to see above the General admission crowd. Highly recommend the VIP experience. Worth the price. Picked up the tickets and laminates at will call without a hitch. After party access to The Foundation room was easy although there were WAY too many people in that space to enjoy the venue. The 'security' at that venue was pretty aggressive for no reason and they were less than helpful. View of the strip was nice though. I'll stick to the HOB venue itself and skip the Foundation Room in the future."}
{"text":"An all in one experience.  It's the House of Blues.  The House of Blues is best known for being a concert hall, but you can get a bite to eat or down a few cold ones all the same.  I've seen Boogie Nights (a bitchin' 70's cover band) here and it was a blast.  The floor is spacious and can accomodate hundreds.  Opposite the stage is a bar and a couple of levels for people to hand out and watch if they don't want to be in the middle of the crowd.  However, some of the watching space, especially right in the middle in front of the bar, is for VIP seating.  Drinks are typical Vegas pricing.  You are inside the Mandalay Bay after all.  On a separate occasion I grabbed lunch at the restaurant.  It's in a portion totally apart from the concert hall.  Mix of booth and table seating.  I got a burger and beer.  Quality of food and service is good, but nothing extraordinary.  Set me back around 15 bucks, so you're not breaking the bank by any means.  It's also family friendly place."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite Venus in town. The box office is right at the entrance. There are 3 bars on the main floor and 2 bars on the second floor on opposing sides. The acoustics here are good. I like them more than at The Joint. The sound is always spot on. I've yet to go to a show here with bad sound. I enjoy the view from the top as much as being on the floor and it's not as loud lol.  There's a decent size floor area. I like how intimate it feels.  Their drink prices are why they get the 4. They aren't that affordable especially if you're trying to drink spirits. They'll typically have tall boys that make you ask yourself what you're thinking spending so much for beer in a can but it's that or stand there drink free the entire night and no one wants that.  The workers, like security, are always chill and pretty laid back but straight forward; never a bother unless you deserve it. Kind of sux if you're a smoker b/c u have to go upstairs towards the entrance for the smoke pit; good for non smokers though."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at the House of Blues in Las Vegas. I have to say I was very disappointed with the buffalo wings. They were not hot (spicy) at all, they were very mild at best. I'm also not a fan of huge gigantic wings, and boy were these wings big. When visiting the House of Blues my advice would be to stay away from the buffalo wings."}
{"text":"I loved this spot!  The acoustics are amazing!!!!!  If I come back to Vegas I will have to try to catch a show there again!!   If your at the house of Blues be prepared for a weak drink.  They use jiggers and the cups they had were to big for only 1 oz of booze.   Lesson learned, my second drink was a double and it was perfect.  I'm a bartender so when I  saw the jigger I already knew it wasn't going to be good.  Either get smaller cups or make all your drinks a double."}
{"text":"Went with a friend before cavs game.  Dead on a Wednesday night.  Food was fine, gumbo appetizer so-so.  Flatbread pizza was quite good. Service very fine although it wasn't busy at all.  Most entrees are $20+"}
{"text":"The House of Blues is fantastic!! We have been here several times, the different venues are incredible, the food is outstanding and the staff is exceptional. The events are all across the board, one night might be Blues, another night might be Rock, then another night a \"Rat Pack\" tribute. There is always something to make that dinner or night out exceptional. We have since joined the \"Foundation Room\" and live over an hour from the HOB.  Thank you , House of Blues.....for a great place to share our time.  Check out \"The Corn Bread\" WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Went to see Lindsey Stirling. The ticket wasn't clear enough that the seat was on the 3rd floor and it's almost impossible to have a direct sight toward the stage, instead you give up and watch the screen. Luckily we were able to secure the front row but still, there was a big pillar in between.  The concert was fun, but the venue - not so much."}
{"text":"OMG, avoid this place unless you like being frisked and wanded like at the airport. This is a concert venue not the friggen UN. I wont be back not for the frisk down not for the free tickets, and not! for the $16 dollar beers. Oh lest we forget the obnoxious blue laser lights that hit you in the eyes in this standing room only venue where the headlining cover band has an opening act  which in this case for the Fan Halen band was terrible. So I stood for one hour trying to find a non blinding corner or spot to hang out waiting for very late musicians to take the stage. I cant blame the bands, its probably the club trying to get people to buy super inflated drinks and yes suck more cash out of people before the show ends. Sorry I don't subscribe to the goping broke blind and deaf business model while you greedy club owners get to drive home in Ferraris Maserati's and Bentleys at my or other peoples expense. I call it like I see it."}
{"text":"Oh biscuits and gravy - thou art a comfort food for my belly and soul.  After too many nights up in a row until your nerves are shooting acetacholin randomly and and are as frayed as the bottom of your favorite jeans - thy creamy goodness smoothes over the jagged edges and coates the belly that by now is a cess pool of 3 olive martinis and grand marnier."}
{"text":"Stayed at TheHotel in prep for the Ice Cube concert at HOB LV.  The ticket and markee said the doors open @ 11:59.  So make sure you check out the lobby early.  The line started before 11pm.  If you get there early you may be able to get early entry with there with thier early entry special , but check that out.  The line got very long early, it started to wrap around the casino.  I suggest get a drink or two then stand in line.  Then they heard you past security into this type of holding pen deal, in front of the doors.  They let people enter in groups of 30-50, then would wait 5 minutes and let more in... i guess this was to help crowd control.  But i was just waiting for people to rush the door, which didnt happen luckily.  We had general tix, so we grabbed some watered down drinks from 1 of the 3 bars and headed to a spot on the floor in front of the stage.  WTH is this?! Ok the floor was super sticky.  Like somebody had a honey & beer fest and forgot to clean up.  The floor was so sticky, your shoes stuck as you walked, and dont stand in one place too long, you just might stick.  The lights, and sounds were great.  The show .. pure Ice Cube! I can't comment on the food, or anything else.. but its a good venue that could use some cleaning and better crowd management.  HOB on Sunset is better."}
{"text":"We went to the Sunday Gospel Brunch and it was a lot of fun. The show is very good and the music was fantastic. The singers were top notch and put on an enjoyable show. The food was flavorful and good but not hot enough. The jambalaya and mac and cheese were the best. I do like that they had buffalo sauce for the chicken and waffles which was very tasty. Service was eh. We asked for a coke that we never received and they would bring by small water pitchers that filled 2 glasses and then come back with another 20 minutes later so water was not always refilled. I also thought $10 for a bloody mary with the price of the ticket was a little much. Tables are also very close. Take one table out and then it would have been fantastic. I know they loose money that way but it would have been a lot more comfortable.   Fun event for a Sunday morning. Worth seeing once and for the price, you get a meal and a show so price is good. Just needs a little work with keeping the food hotter and a few more servers."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, the place is really interesting.  I had a miss communication with the server and he didn't understand and gave me the wrong thing. .. but once i told them they were very nice and cater to me.. super nice and good food."}
{"text":"We had tickets for a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert which was cancelled at the last minute and I scrambled to find a viable entertainment option.  When I spied the \"Kings of Chaos\" (billed as the Ultimate Rock Super Group), I was \"all-in.\"   When we arrived to partake in pre-show adult beverages, we ran smack dab into what appeared to be a full TSA screening of guests.  There was plenty of uniformed security with metal detection wands to ensure nobody got shanked at the show.  Cool.  Just make it snappy and don't hold me up too long.                Inside, there's a good sized main bar on the lower level, which does the trick.  Expect to pay a fair amount for your cocktails.  If you want apps, there isn't much to get excited about.  One of the offerings was a Caesar Salad, which I found odd and galactically uninviting.  Just bring a couple of portable snacks with you, providing they pass through the security shake-down.    We had seats in section 206, which is located on the second floor.  Most of the seats had a nice view, and once the band started playing there's was a fair amount of unregulated seat hopping by guests.  The venue itself is large enough to pack some people into, but small enough to feel somewhat intimate, depending upon your seating assignment.    There was cocktail waitress service on the second floor, but they did a poor job (and seemed disinterested).  I ended up making a few runs downstairs to the main bar to pick up my drinks.  I was excited to find they serve several varieties of Tall Boys (which makes for fewer trips to the bar, nest pas?)    The lead in band, which warmed up the crowd was a local Las Vegas band, \"Franky Perez and The Truth.\"  If you're from Las Vegas, you'll probably know Franky.  He's one bad ass entertainer.  He really grabs your attention and puts on a show.  His band was actually better than the main event \"Super Group.\"  I liked the HOB venue, and would easily consider going back for a show there.  My takeaway was seeing Franky Perez play and planning to see him play the next time I roll into town."}
{"text":"AVOID. This venue was not designed for the shows that HOB is presenting. First, you go through a weird security line and scanning in the middle of the casino. Next, you walk down a bunch (two floors) of stairs to get into HOB. After that, you walk into what is basically a bar/restaurant with a dance floor. There are multiple staircases, and I hate to think about what would happen if a fire broke out. I didn't see any mobility impaired options. Important- don't EVER get GA tickets. Go VIP(ay), or not at all. HOB ropes off every single place to sit, many which are in awkward places for this setup (example- directly across from the long bar, which messes up walking traffic by limiting the space). At the front, there is even a dedicated \"upgrade to VIP\" standing desk (in place of a hostess desk). I would think that this setup would affect the \"maximum capacity\" limit, since so many GA people are jammed into less than 1/2 of the venue, but I guess the numbers (people per square foot) end up looking the same. But, it seems unsafe. Last night, the Dan Band show was supposed to start at 7:30, but the opening act didn't even begin until around 8:30. Long wait. The stage was also too small for the Dan Band to do a lot of their act. Basically, there was no room for cool props at HOB, so there weren't any. Sad. In the future, I'll just skip House of Blues, because there are better venues that also offer $14 beers in Vegas and free seats with a ticket."}
{"text":"When I first walked by this place I felt it looked inviting so the next night I went there around 8pm after seeing a show and secured a table with a great view of the live performer. I was thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere and the drinks/food, I had two margaritas and jambalaya. It's not a place for the budget conscious as this meal did cost me $50 for just myself but the atmosphere made up for much of that.   I've never been to a restaurant with a fun live performer like that not to mention such great food. If you are in the area, I highly recommend this place, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the only place I see bigger bands that i like because they don't typical play anywhere else!...but its still an awesome place and i been coming for years. They have $15 beer that i will not be buying,lol but upstairs is a few nice places with great happy hours, so pre-booze. One of these days ill have the pleasure of sitting in the upper deck for a classy show-until then, I'll hang in the front line on the gate for my fav bands!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! Got 4 orders of bread pudding french toast... super thick and delicious! Ordered eggs and chicken sausage which was really good!!"}
{"text":"Solid.   When you come to the House of Blues, you are usually coming here for some name act. I popped in here last last night with some friends for the Steel Panther show.  Although the show itself was a bit cheesy, it was a fun place to hang out with friends. The bartenders didn't treat me like an idiot when I asked for ice water.  Service is good. Enough bartenders for a full crowd.  The stage and venue is quite small, but it's perfect! I can imagine seeing a big-name act (bigger than Steel Panther) and really enjoying the intimate vibe.  Plenty of televisions so if you are talking to your friends or cozying up to a neighbor, you can still see what's going on in the stage area.  Steel Panther was pretty cool, since locals get in free. Holler.  I'll write up another review when I come here for a real show, but for now....A-OK."}
{"text":"Great and excellent food, and awesome service. Tyler was a great waiter, patients with our kids, and he even knows the time of the food. When he says it going to be a minute, its going to be a minute...I timed him. Live show was great, and all and all it was a great early birthday for our Grandfather. Strongly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Been hear a few times over the past couple of years.  Be prepared unless you are receiving some sort of VIP treatment,  to wait in line for a bit before you roll in into joint.  The layers of employees you contact until you make entry are friendly enough.  If you can make it in early and can build a brief rapport with the bartenders you will be better off as things get busier the less they seem to care. Your going to pay for a buzz..help it along prior to making entry.    Some of the bouncers take comfort in their positions only and have no idea about combining their girth with customer service.  On a street corner or in any other setting...a large dude that does not smile after salutations or small talk is a dick. Trust me... I know what being a large and sometimes FAT man is all about. You are not protecting the president..RELAX.  As for the venue, the closer you can get to stage, the better.  And if on the north and south sides of stage, the closer the better.  Looking forward to expounding on my HOB knowledge in the future and looking forward to more good times."}
{"text":"Very Impressed! Gospel music and brunch are my two favorite things already but the service was outstanding and the performance was remarkable! The price was well worth the experience, and I look forward to returning monthly. Also would like to give a special thanks to my friend Angel for inviting me out, and Jason for his above and beyond hospitality."}
{"text":"So I came here with a friend to see Billy Idol. Did not try any of the food, drink, or even relieve myself while there. Did not pass go or collect 200 - went straight to the floor area right near the stage and pretty much had an awesome view of the stage for the whole show. Was told by the box office employee earlier that a line usually starts about an hour before doors open. Sure enough there were already 20 people in line when we showed up. Billy Idol had already done a few weeks of shows in residency so all the bugs were worked out and the show itself was flawless other than a faulty mic. Place can hold a few thousand and after all the added Dickheadmaster (or whoever) fees it's just a little under hundred. Other seating costs more. You do the number crunch. Place was packed and he played all his hits. For souvenir collectors - Steve Stevens just stands there after the encore throwing out hundreds of his personalized guitar picks. Thought that was pretty cool. So for the concert experience I had that night at the House Of Blues - I give this place a five as far as an up close and personal place to see a show. In the Mandalay Bay. Come early. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The Gospel Brunch was excellent. Despite mixed reviews on other sites, we found the food to be excellent, the talent amazing and the energy uplifting. Not sure how it goes down in other city's house of blues gospel brunches but the 15+ Vegas performers were spot on. We'll worth attending."}
{"text":"The food is actually quite terrible.. service isn't bad.. sub par beer menu..completely overpriced. But hey who doesn't like a salty $15 fish Sammy!!! So if your coming for the food... don't!!!"}
{"text":"Wish there was some seating :/. 4\" heals for 3 hours gets a little tough.  Otherwise, fun spot :)"}
{"text":"Love the trendy decor! The best wings combo I have ever had. They serve buffalo wings over a nest of coleslaw. It is so good. After you finish your wings, the slaw has soaked up flavors from the wings and it is out of this world amazing!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. The service was. While our waiter was great and knowledgeable, we had to wait over an hour for our food. Added to that is the fact that we had to wait to be seated. This is reasonable, but they ask for your cell phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. They texted us, and then we stood and waited another 10 minutes before they sat us. All around this experience was a bust. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good. The BBQ pizza appetizer was great, as was the macaroni and cheese. The citrus chicken was good, nothing special. The service was very, very slow."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Tuesday morning. Yummy, quick, great service, reasonable price.  Definitely will go back.  Ham & cheese omelet was great."}
{"text":"***I have been to a few House of Blues locations and this was probably the weakest of the bunch; pretty run-of-the-mill food***  Please note that this review is for the food only.  I've been to three House Of Blues--the original one in Chicago (which had a very nice interior, and the food tasted better too; maybe the atmosphere helped), the one in Anaheim (super busy, okay food), and this one at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.  I felt this Las Vegas location was the weakest of the three.  It was around five-ish, and we had late dinner plans.  We decided to come here to hold us over.  It was pretty dead.  For food, I went with the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which was pretty run-of-the-mill.  It was served with pretty boring and depressing looking french fries.  It was your typical chain experience."}
{"text":"In the land of feed trough restaurants of mass produced mounds of food dieing in a steam table. This place stands out, here you can set down order your food the way you want it. Adds or subtracts.   Great drinks large portions friendly staff. My Favorite place in Vagas for Breakfast."}
{"text":"I came to the House of Blues for the first time to watch AFI/Saosin many years ago. However, since Yelp didn't exist or was big then. Also, I never had experiences in other venues, so I couldn't really judge.  One thing I like about this place that the atmosphere isn't cramped or disgusting looking. Maybe it was also because being emo and scene wasn't that big during my high school years, but the venue wasn't full of high school teens who think the world revolves around them. I also like that there's a big enough back area to chill in unlike some smaller venues where you're just packed in one floor.  All in all, I think House of Blues is one of the better venues out there."}
{"text":"It was my first time enjoying a show at the House of Blues.  It's located in Mandalay Bay Casino and very easy to find.  Attached to the venue is a restaurant which has live music acts as well!   To get to the main level, you take stairs down to where the bar, seating and general admission floor is.   There is also a second level with seating that looked comfy!  It's a smaller venue but I think that's what I love most about it.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house.  The sound acoustics were great to really get a feel for the show.  Fabulous!  I can't wait to come back for another show in this fantastic venue! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, somewhat slow service. The music was pretty good. Went several times and Woody's Rampage from Louisiana was our favorite! Excellent guitar. We had several menu items, mahi-mahi sandwich, fried chicken, bread pudding, vegetable dish with side of Mac n cheese. The cornbread is really good, mushroom soup and bratwurst."}
{"text":"This is for the concert hall only.  We've been here for three concerts and last night for the B-52's was the worst.  The venue itself is nice as are the acoustics.  My concern is how tightly people are packed in the SRO section in front of the stage.  The management needs to do a better job spreading people out as there are other places to stand.  It would be almost impossible to safely and rapidly exit in an emergency."}
{"text":"Lisa was fantastic. Street tacos were amaze-balls. Margherita flatbread was to die for."}
{"text":"Great show last nite with Panama! Great crowd and atmosphere!  Loved the music and performance they put on.  Would love to see them at this venue again."}
{"text":"Wife and I where there on a Friday nite for a concert at 10, we got there about 8 and the food / service was slow."}
{"text":"I went to this location about a month ago on a first date. The girl that I was with wanted to go somewhere with live music, so while we were at Mandalay Bay, I quickly yelped this location.   The music was pretty good, the singer was singing mostly country songs. I am not a fan of country music, every song sounds the same and its always about failed relationships. Anyways, my date loved the music there, and I loved many interesting things about country music from her. So, it was educational, but I still hate country music.   I ordered their pasta with bolognese sauce, and she got their thai shrimp salad. The food was below par for the quality and prices. The pasta was tasteless and had a bitter flavor in the meat sauce and the salad barely had any dressing in it and the shrimp was bit chewy. We were not happy with the food, but the atmosphere and music seemed to be the main attraction. Also, the prices are pretty reasonable, so if you are at their bar for drinks and live music than this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"stopped here by chance for breakfast- kinda wanted to avoid the buffets...  anyway- the breakfast food was actually very delicious ! the menu is a little small and a little questionable at first cause it looks like everything is al a  carte but it all comes with essentials like toast and whatnot.  i ordered the 3 egg omelette - you get a choice of 3 fillings - and it comes with toast of choice and AMAZING hash browns. i also got a coffee - for a total of $15 for my bill. not bad if you ask my cheap ass.  Our waitress Ashley was great and funny and always alert. Id come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This is where the night's DYL activities officially began.  I'm saying officially because you know we all started pickling our livers within an hour of getting off the plane.  Broken up into three seperate sections, you can either catch show in the main concert hall, a smaller more intimate performance in a cafe type setting, or grab a bite and drink in the restaurant bar.  Our only option for this night was the restaurant/bar.  Nothing really to write home about as far as the bar aspect of this place.  They have a medium sized bar at the very back of the restaurant.  With not a whole lot of bar area seating we squeezed ourselves into a couple booths as close to the bar as possible.  I think they were kind of miffed that we weren't there to have dinner, although we did order some bites to eat while drinking.  If they had any clue what they had sitting in their establishment they would have made a killing on drinks that night.  But they didn't so we had a few drinks, waited for the stragglers to join us, then headed to the next DYL stop of the night."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this place mainly cause its UBER fun! Let's start with the concerts. Decently priced entertainment in Vegas is hard to come by. Here I rock out with the wife in a totally cool concert hall and I still got enough for the booze. The last act I caught here was Satriani and dude was I blown away! Ok now the food is the usual fair but not the generic casino food you always see. Wings are hot served with slaw and bleu cheese. Pepperoni Pizza's are crisp. Smokehouse Burger with Bacon is my usual choice cause with the burgers they load the fries. They also put together a pretty good rib platter. Ceaser salad with Salmon was nicely put together. Gumbo was flavorful and filled with sausage and shredded chicken. So if your down for the type of food that goes great with loud live music and I say this cause there is always some band or act playing on the main stage then your in for a treat. The Bread Pudding is what the wife likes. Servers here are simply the most down to earth people you'll ever meet. Amongst the chaos of live music she was able to keep our order totally straight with a smile to die for. Party of six. I don't  mention names in my reviews but if you get the sweetest red hair lady you will agree. Since you read this far here the secret tip, the happy hour is the best time cause its half off all the appetizers. Other times this place can tend to be a bit pricey with the added entertainment taxes that Las Vegas charges when Live music is playing. If you go to  http://restaurant.com your able to get a discount voucher that you can use to counter this extra expense. My last note on the House is Check out the Steel Panther act. I had a good buzz and stumbled in to the concert. It was the funnest time I ever had at a rock concert. It was Hilarious!!! Then after the concert there's an DJ Spinning out After the restaurant closes. This place is way too much fun."}
{"text":"Gospel brunch - 2 for 1 tickets and still not a good value for the money.   Chior was as expected but food and service were terrible.  No spoons in place setting.  Coffee pitchers on tables went cold quick.  Seating too crammed in hard to get thru the fat people.   Seat number written on table not waterproof bled ink onto wife's sleeve.  Wooden folding chairs uncomfortable. Asked for tea and was brought one cup of hot water and no refill.  Shrimp should be peeled for 55$.  Understaffed for table servers. Mainly just mediocre quality and selection for buffet food.  Dessert bar was  cheap danish and cookies.  Pre entertainment time was too loud to talk.  Too dark to see selections at buffet.  Especially bad at omelet bar."}
{"text":"Delicious eats for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Great drinks, excellent service.  I enjoyed the live music as well.  This was my favorite place to eat in the entire Mandalay Bay Resort."}
{"text":"This was one of the best night out we have had in a long time.  Before you go writing off The House of Blues as a \"touristy\" thing or a \"chain\" like Hard Rock Cafes take a look at their offerings and come in and see for yourself that they are far from average.  On Tuesday which happened to be Valentine's Day we did dinner along with a concert at The House of Blues. It was so much fun.  Far starters we made reservations in advance because we knew it would be crowded - we arrived and were seated right away. Frank, our waiter was really personable and he did not rush us into ordering.  In fact, he was great at helping us choose drinks and a great selection of appetizers to enjoy before the concert.  I tried the Strawberry Bubbly a very festive drink for the evening It was made with Stoli Vodka, strawberry, fresh lemon, La Marca Prosecco.  I am so glad I tried it!  It was fresh and delicious... I made myself stop at one because it went down as easy as Koolaid! My sister had a Patron on the rocks and my daughter had a root beer. For snacks we ordered the Mardi Gras Fries to share. These fries are AWESOME!!!  Crawfish and smoked Gouda cheese sauce with red peppers and Cotija cheese over crispy fries - This Louisiana girl was in heaven!  The cream sauce is really nice not too spicy and not too heavy either.  I will go back for these again before the end of the month as they are only available through February,  Other goodies we snaked on included the Calamari, a pretzel, regular fries and coleslaw.  I loved the calamari.  I did not get the spicy sauces it normally comes with instead I opted for plain or a little ketchup on it. The Pretzel Rhyan chose was huge and had a really great flavor all on its own.  It came with two sauces.  One a cheese and the other a honey mustard. The honey mustard was my favorite. Really nice mild flavor and not overpowering. My sister loved the coleslaw.  She said it was one of the best ones she has had in ages,. Very tangy but not not too vinegary. She said she will definitely want that again next time!  We all really loved the meal.  Frank really took great care of us.  We cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service slow, and the prices outrageous.  The atmosphere is rock and blues, and it fits.  But $14 for a tiny hamburger and fries is too much.  The beers were cheaper because it was happy hour.   They had some unknown musicians playing and they were not too bad."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place. Really. And I do appreciate the gorgeous artwork on the ceiling and in the upper eaves. And the cool light shows that the stage is set up for. But when it comes to acoustics, service, and general comfort, this location fails.   What should be a small, intimate concert experience always devolves into a sweaty, shoving free-for-all, with some 6'6'' dude standing right in front of me and a 10 minute wait at the bar for a $13 drink. The no re-entry policy kind of makes me feel an animal being herded into a corral during set breaks.  I saw Umphree's McGee here last night, and have seen Moby, Metric, Ghostland Observatory, Karl Denson, and Wilco in the past. The Karl Denson and Wilco shows worked here, because there was very limited attendance, making them quiet, intimate events.   For a truly intimate venue, I like the E-String. But for a bigger crowd, the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip would be a better choice."}
{"text":"I waited about 9 months to attend the Carlos Santana show last Saturday night at HOB Vegas. I attended the greatest \"show I have ever seen in a bar\". Music was great and the HOB staff that I saw really did an incredible job taking care of all the guests. Our bartender \"Victor\"? I think his name?..great guy, polite, fast, you got a positive vibe when the staff seems to enjoy their work. I look forward to attending other shows there..  I will be back! Thanks HOB Vegas!"}
{"text":"First things first: Jennifer is the supervisor and she is ahhhhh-mazing! While we were waiting in line for the restaurant and gear shop to open, she was more than willing to answer any questions about the Pass the Line process and HOB in general. She's an absolute delight! And Gretchen at the bar is also wonderful. She's very attentive, personal, and witty. I've never been to a HOB before, but if I go to another, it will be hard for them to compare!"}
{"text":"House of blues in Vegas is much like the other ones in the country, They are generally nice venues. This one in Vegas has two major negatives. The first is the horrible view from general admission and the second and Worst one is absolutely insane beer prices, $13- for a can of beer? This is a blatant rip off and really shows where the priorities are. Without customers you cannot sell your over priced drinks. Put the customer first and not your profits. Once that happens then you will have both. You really feel like a sucker when you realized you just spent $40- for three beers. I guess in Vegas, House of blues is looking for a quick buck just like everyone else and not repeat customers."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a weekday afternoon because it didn't look too busy and we wanted a place that had burgers. First off, we either had a brand new waiter or this guy was checked out because he was AWFUL. He would tell us the wrong pricing for the catch of the day, he didn't know any of the beers on tap off the top of his head, and he mixed up everybody's bill at the end! They really need to step up there service here. I understand if you are new, and you can't remember all the different beers on tap, but you have to solve the problem by saying you will find out the answer. This waiter would just keep bringing the hostess to our table so that she could tell us about the  beers on tap or what was on the menu. Or another time when all he could tell us about a cheese on a burger was that it was yellow. Yup, a yellow cheese. Plus I saw this waiter sitting and hanging out with friends at another table while we were ordering food! Simply unacceptable.   But anyways, we started off with a giant pretzel for the appetizer and it was quite good! Huge pretzel that is easy to share with everyone. I ended up getting the Juicy Lucy (~$14) which is a beef burger topped with bacon, provolone, jalapenos, and chipotle mayo. It was very good! The food was actually pretty tasty. Just terrible service, which caused me to rate it a 3/5.   Pros: - large menu that has more than just southern food - tasty burgers  - seasonal menu for Oktoberfest (get the giant pretzel!)  Cons: - terrible service (or at least terrible waiter)   Why I gave it a 3.... Mainly because of how bad our waiter was. Besides that, the food was pretty good. We all enjoyed our meals. I just wish our waiter would have tried to know what was on the menu and I wish he didn't hang out at another table during the middle of the busy lunch service."}
{"text":"Been here about 100 times in the last 5 years.  Service is usually pretty good. The prices are just outrageous, but if you expect that, you'll plan appropriately. The sound system is great and the lay out if cool. NO FIGHTING, and I am okay with that."}
{"text":"So, let me start off by telling y'all that I have had a great experience here, a full year ago.  This trip was the total opposite.  On both occasions that my friends and I came for lunch, the service was horrible.  The first time was sitting in the bar area, which I've learned from working in restaurants that the service is generally much faster and better in the bar.  This was not the case.  Group of four and two meals came out, then twenty minutes later, the other two.  The bartender was cool about it, and told me to come back tomorrow, he would comp a beer when I returned.  Nice right.....  Yeah, don't trust a part time bartender...  Never happened, and I didn't feel the need to argue over a beer, just let it go.   Don't get me wrong the food is really AMAZEBALLS!  Just the service took this place completely off of my list for next years conference, and judging by the reviews I'm guessing that I'm not the only one. I can get amazing food from many places in Las Vegas.    So during the second \"redemption\" visit, the waitress, you could tell was new.  Which was fine, and frankly I felt she did ok, but again the service was very slow, and the food took way too long to hit the table.  We sat for about 45 minutes. P.S. I promise, our group did not complain or act rude.  We were just enjoying the last day together with each other. Also, if you look at most of my other reviews I'm probably a little too kind when it comes to ratings.  By the end of the meal, the \"Supervisor\" came over to ask how things were.  I filled him in on the slow service, and how I understood running a restaurant is hard work.  Also, told him about the promised beer, and the food lag time.  All he did was give a couple of excuses and talk about this Awesome night club that was connected to the House of Blues.  If the Douche really knew about the business he would have seen four empty drinks and tried to salvage the service, instead of talking about a Bombtastic night club.  He also stated that we would be receiving some tickets for the night club from our waitress, which never came.    Two promises that the House of Blues committed too, and two failures.  Sorry that we had this experience.  I'm sure they are probably off our list for next year, which is really sad for me.  The food was really good, and the atmosphere is exactly my thing.   Single tear just ran down my cheek.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"After eating not impressive breakfast at the Luxor's Cafe we went looking for something different. My husband had eggs benedict just as he had at the other restaurant but it was so much better and about $5 cheaper I had the grits and egg breakfast and it was delicious needed a little salt and pepper but that is to taste anyways. The Grits were the heavier hominy grits I chose sausage on the side because I don't eat meat.  They were gigantic! My breakfast yesterday at Luxor was $19 and sub par, the shrimp and eggs were $11.  We will be back later this week for gater bites!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Delicious, not rushed but not slow, affordable, and would totally go back."}
{"text":"Awful, awful food, terrible, terrible service I will never come back here.  They get one star cuz the drink was decent.  I highly recommend you do not dine here"}
{"text":"Delicious food, prompt service, great atmosphere. Our server Jennifer was the highlight of the experience, she's fantastic. She recommended the Voodoo Shrimp as the best thing on the menu, and after trying it we 100% believe her- I'll literally be thinking about that dish weeks from now."}
{"text":"You should know you can do bottle service and get a table for a show, but decide that before you buy your first round. One vodka cran = $13. Bottle of Skyy vodka and a table is $200+tax and they go up from there. In fact, you should PREGAME in the casino or in your room if nothing else. $13 is crazy to me, for a vodka cran. I pay half that in GA (different worlds).. and it's especially wacky since right outside the venue in Mandalay Bay you sit at a machine and start getting your drinks free.  PREGAME.  Despite that, the staff is super nice. Natalie behind the bar is excellent, and the girl who handles the bottle service is also very sweet.  I haven't been to any House of Blues in quite a while, and this was definitely my first time at this one. The venue is pretty awesome.  It feels like a short distance from the stage to the back of the room, and the \"pit\" area is lower than the surrounding bar area, so it feels like most spots give you a pretty good view. Fairly easy access to the bars even when it was as packed as it was gonna get all night, although I'm sure it's not always easy. And if you care, the curtain on stage was suuuper cute. It was a patchwork quilt that I just wanted to curl up in.  There's a second floor/balcony seating, but they didn't seem to be allowing many people up there while we were there.  The stairs were blocked off at the main entrance, and we were not sure why, or who was already up there, but you could see a crowd.   This particular show - The Neighbourhood and Kitten - was All Ages.. which was weird to me. So there were a ton of teens, including the ones standing in front of us whom at first I was hoping would leave to go to the bar (before I realized they were probably underage). There are plusses, though, to sharing a concert with so many under-21s: Less people at the bar, and I can see over the whole crowd!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved the hamburger and fries.  My kids had the mac and cheese and I had to try it and loved it.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is ok, the prices are high, the ambiance is kind of cool. There isnt anything awful about this place but there also isnt anything rad about it. It is a safe bet for a decent meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Also was surprised at the quality of the food and drink.  Enjoyed watching Stephen Marley et al here. Would definitely return to the venue."}
{"text":"Excellent service. My kid fell asleep at the table, even after the server brought a Shirley temple with an abundance of extra cherries to try and keep him awake. By no fault of her own, it didn't work, she even had them turn down the air cause he was whining about it being cold (needy, I know!) and I still missed out on the live music. C'est la vie when you try and stretch a 6 year old pool tuckered out kiddo past 8p. Anyway...food was pretty good. We got the Cajun chicken pasta with the add of shrimp and the shrimp were over cooked (should slide out of the tail, but these needed to be peeled) and omg the amount of oil left in the bottom of the dish had me running up and down the strip in 100 degree heat the next day to try and work it off. It was tasty but way too much oil, pooling in the bottom it should not."}
{"text":"FOOD REVIEW ONLY  I thought I had food poisoning after eating here. My stomach hurt for hours. It's DISGUSTING. As I was eating I remember thinking \"this is friggin GROSS\" but I was so hungry I ate the majority of my meal. We ended up going here because we were staying in the hotel and someone told us they had good food. WRONG."}
{"text":"Ben here multiple  time to eat and have fun . When possible  ask for D'Andre  the server he will take care of you..  As far as the food it pretty  good the meatloaf  is good fried chicken  is good   Did mentioned  they have live music also."}
{"text":"First show I have seen at House of Blues in Vegas, this was back in January for Amon Amarth and Enslaved....first off the place is at Mandalay Bay which is at the end of  the strip which sucks to travel too, the venue is very small which is unacceptable given this is a huge hotel/casino, seriously you will have no room to move, when I did it just caused fights.  It is sort of setup like an EDM club, you have tables right in the middle of the venue and all the rest of us have to stand around either near the two bars on either side of the venue or behind the aforementioned \"tables\" , totally sucks ass...drinks are way too much, service sucks, the only redeeming value for this place is the sound is good, well in a small room the sound should be good !!  Outside where they sell merch and band signings is essentially just an open area right by all the casino shit....The Joint @ Hard Rock is far superior to this venue, do not go to a show at House of Blues it is all style and no substance...!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family on January 25th to see Who's Bad a Michael Jackson tribute band. We ate dinner here first - the food was AMAZING!! But.... The show was set to start at 11pm according to the website which was already very late but we figured it is a Saturday, no big deal. However, the show did not begin until 11:30! Not to mention the weather was horrible that night so we really did not want to be driving home at 2am! The show was great though, so that made up for it but to me a show that is already set to start at 11pm has no reason to start late, especially at almost midnight! The least they could have did was announce that it would not start on time."}
{"text":"I used to love the Hard Rock Venue but they have rebuilt it in a weird way so now this is my favorite place for standing room only tickets.  They have a wrap around bar so its not all the way in the back of the room up a ton of stairs and they serve food which is very good, not greasy bar food.  Cool vibe and no matter where you stand, there is a decent view of the stage and they have video all over the place as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened. We were here a while back for a concert and we raved about how good the food was so when I saw an email for free tickets to that night's show with food purchase, I thought, why not?  The food was nothing like it was the last time we were there. The jerk wings were insanely good the last time and these were not. I'm a wing person and I didn't want to finish them because they were old and drowned in sauce, probably to cover up the old. The burgers we got were just ok so I have nothing good or bad to say about those. Service was a little slow to start but we found out she was new, so I'm not gonna knock any points for service. I just wish the food was just as good as the last time. Maybe this place will get another chance but it'll be some time."}
{"text":"Came here to see \"The Dan Band\". First time here and did not know they had a venue down stairs. I did not see an elevator so if you cant handle stairs this may not be for you. Love the décor. Its got a feel of old time stuff with an upgrade. Its kinda small but, have 3 areas with bars. Before we went in the security wands you and they check the purses and anything that is in pockets. I had a bottle of water in my purse and I had to throw it away.  When we got inside we did just order bottle water (wasn't in the mood to drink) and that cost was $11.00. They do serve food such as street tacos. pizza etc. It smelled good but, did not try anything we ate before coming.  It was very crowded we were on the stage floor waiting for the show to start and it got so packed like we were sardines and yes you did get bumped with people squeezing thru. But the show was really good. Dan was good with his two older back up guys and he kept the audience entertained."}
{"text":"This was a great venue to view a live concert, especially since they still have reserved seating, something that has all but disappeared from smaller music venues.  I like the property, I like the staff, the acoustics were great and it was a pleasant experience.  I do have a caveat for those attending shows there however- particularly people who buy their tickets online at Live Nation or Ticketmaster with the intent of printing their tickets at home.  If you print your tickets online and are offered the \"Pass the Line\" option, don't buy it.  It's not necessary.  At the House of Blues home page, it clearly states that all a person has to do is present a receipt from the restaurant or gift shop in order to automatically receive priority entrance into the music hall.  This is true at all HOB locations in the USA, per their website.  Furthermore if like me you purchase assigned seating tickets, there really is no need for priority entrance.  Those who have General Admission/Standing Room Only tickets will have a priority, as they can get into the music hall faster and secure a better place to watch the show.  Since I did not visit the HOB website to purchase my ticket to a recent show at the Las Vegas HOB, I was not aware of this option until after the fact.  I went to Tickemaster/LiveNation and bought the ticket there. During the check out process, an icon for \"Pass the Line\" popped up with an offer.  Buy a Pass the Line voucher in advance online, and receive not just the priority entrance, but also $20 on the voucher good towards purchase in the restaurant or gift shop.  I took it because I already knew I would be eating dinner at HOB before the show.  The voucher did not provide anything at a discount or for free, and in fact it is restrictive because it has to be used the night of the performance.  It really isn't anything more than HOB finding a way to receive payment for a meal or gift shop purchase well in advance.  Good marketing, but not good value for the consumer.  I bit anyway- that was a mistake.  After the ticket and the $20 voucher were paid for, I received an email link to print my ticket.  Upon printing I discovered that the printout includes a coupon for $10 off a restaurant meal purchase(s) of $25 or more.  The verbiage does not state it is not for the date of the ticketed performance, or excludes that performance, nor does it state that it cannot be combined with any other offer.  It is blatantly an attempt to get concert goers to eat at the restaurant, period.  So I took my receipt for the prepaid voucher to the box office and was issued the voucher.  I also had the $10 off offer on the printout with me.  When I presented the voucher worth $20 in conjunction with the printed meal discount offer, I was told they could not be used together, that the discount was for a future date as in incentive for people to return to dine.   I disagreed and said there was no verbiage to that effect.  I spoke to the manager, and explained that not only was the verbiage not present, but also the $20 voucher I tendered as payment was not a freebie or a comp, I paid the $20 in advance.  In other words, I was not getting anything for free by using it.  The manager attempted to tell me that was the fee to get past the line and onto the VIP line, at which point I pointed out that there was nothing special, as I could have merely dined and obtained a receipt, and presented the receipt with my ticket as proof of dining.  The manager abruptly relented and stated he would honor both because he \"wants me to have a good time at the concert.\"  I don 't necessarily believe that was his true motive, but it works for me.    The moral of the story is that if you are  planning on dining at HOB prior to the show, just pay for your dinner when you get there."}
{"text":"Wow-one of the best breakfast opportunities in Vegas. Great heart healthy options too. Terrific service by Katie. We be back this week!"}
{"text":"St patty's day here was awesome! Live bands all day long, great food and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the breakfast here. When we stay at Mandalay Bay we eat here every morning, Sun, Mon, Tues. Those are the days we are there. Not going to say what month. They have a deal if your staying in Mandalay Bay and you bring your receipt from the first days breakfast you get like half off every day afters breakfast. How can I beat that. Also on those days they are not that busy.   The breakfast has always been good. I love eggs, they have great eggs. I love bacon, they have great bacon. I love sausage, they have great sausage. I especially love biscuits and gravy and well I would have to say their biscuits and gravy are pretty darn good. The waiters are excellent too."}
{"text":"We got a 2-1 Breakfast Coupon for the House of Blues and it was well worth it. The food , coffee and service was excellent. It came to about $25 with a tip for both of us. Not a bad deal for an upscale hotel."}
{"text":"Located inside Mandalay Bay, House of Blues is a beautiful venue with gorgeous architecture, unique artwork and design.   I was there to see Pvris. The sound quality was good and overly experience was decent.   I wasn't impressed with one of the security guards that was hitting on my friend and the lack of seating for those of us with disabilities and chronic illness.   Drinks also cost a lot at the bar."}
{"text":"3 of us have now been sitting on the Patio at HOB for 25 minutes and have yet to be waited on. Happy hour prices are good but if u can't get service it's not worth it. Save ur time and go across the street & enjoy a $2 pint plus better service."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic musicWent in for breakfast enjoyed the meal so much that we returned for dinner and to our surprise we got to listen to a great guitarist while enjoying our dinner of fried chicken."}
{"text":"Can I just say I love themed restaurants, bars, stores etc. basically I love Vegas right hahha. I love the vibe and decor of this place. The fact that they have live music just makes this a must when visiting Las Vegas or even if you're a resident. The food is is great!! Essentially after drinking -_-"}
{"text":"We visit the House of Blues for Homegrown Thursdays when local bands take the stage and you get to eat and have a show.   Our friends, Left Standing, were playing last night (7/7/11) and we decided to eat at the show and show some support.   We arrived, waited for seats even though there were open tables right in front of the stage. When we were being seated, we politely asked if it would be possible to sit closer to the stage, as those tables were open. We were told there was no server for that section. I'm sorry, but a section consisting of 2 tables in a place like the HOB?!?!? I don't think so.  We took the table we were offered, in the back of the room, off to the side and basically on the gaming floor.   Before we even ordered our drinks, there was another couple at the the table where there \"isn't a server\". Oh, and they got their food before we did!  Our server was great, let me get that out there. He was busy, and forgot out water, but he was good. He had good personality and corrected anything we needed. I ordered two sides, the veggies and mashed potatoes. The veggies were good, but in my opinion, not warm enough.   The potatoes came out at the same time as Chris' meal and they were COLD. After a few bites the server came to check on us, when I mentioned the potatoes were cold, he immediately took them and brought me new ones. We didn't have to wait for refills, and he continued to check on us all night.   I am not one to keep quiet, though. I asked to speak to the floor manager and question the policy regarding the seating. I explained the situation, very calmly, and made it very clear that I was in NO WAY complaining about the service.  As a result, we were offered better seating that was open, and they comp'd us some drinks and desserts.    The section we moved to had a different server, and he was on top of it. He had a great personality and checked on us frequently.   The menu, unfortunately, got much smaller than we remembered. When we first started coming to the HOB I remember it had a \"real\" menu - the plastic covered kind with multiple pages. Now they're down to a 1 page oversized piece of paper with food on one side and drinks on the other. If you are with a picky eater, don't bother. Or, if you won't want to pay out the ass for your meal, you're in the wrong place.   The more we go here, the more we are disappointed in the establishment. We've had good service, in fact, past servers even came up to us and checked in.   With this seating fiasco and the limited menu, the only times we will ever return is for Left Standing or another friend-band playing  - and we'll likely skip the food and drinks and just stand for the show."}
{"text":"I've been to the House Of Blues metal venue before. It's very tight and narrow, therefore, for sold out shows you're very elbow to elbow with other fellow metal heads. When you're in this much of tight quarters everyone ends up talking to each other and joining in on random conversations, something that doesn't happen in antisocial Vancouver. It was just nice to do some pre show socializing. They place may be narrow but it's very logically constructed that no matter where you are you'll get a good view."}
{"text":"Love the HOB! We saw a great band here, and it was amazing. Again, the wings will never let you down... so great! The prices weren't too outlandish considering the great atmosphere and live music."}
{"text":"Their gumbo soup is really good. There's lots of flavor.   However, their jambalaya - not so much. The rice was mushy, and it tasted very tomato-y but without much flavor.. The portion was very large though. It's definitely big enough for two.  The cornbread was very good. It came out in a cute little skillet. It's an appetizer that you'd definitely want to share. It does have jalapeños in it. The maple butter that it came with was delish.  The lobster mac & cheese was super creamy. It had lots of big chunks of lobster."}
{"text":"My son dragged me into the House of Blues for lunch inside the Mandalay Bay. In the beginning, I was leary. But from the start, our waitress was right on spot. Very attentive and friendly. I ordered the 1/2 slab of ribs with vegetables and sweet potato fries and added the House of Blues salad on the side for just $4.00 more. When the salad arrived at the table, it was enormous. Could have easily been a meal itself. I shared some with the family, and they loved it so much, they all ordered one for themselves as well. The sweet potato fries were the best I've tasted. Mixed vegetables were green beans, snap peas, and asparagus sauteed. The ribs were St Louis style and just right. Happily surprised and will now make sure I visit the Vegas House of Blues for lunch on my next trip."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast! Minus the eggshell on one day and the champagne aluminum the other day. Those are minor imperfections compared to the bartenders, waiters and gift shop staff. Everyone was super nice, hostesses can use a little pep when greeting but once you are inside, you totally forget they were even a part of seating you."}
{"text":"Good god - it's not that we sat down for brunch with HIGH expectations... But the huge servings of terrible food didn't make up for the fact that it was still terrible food.  Service was terrible to boot."}
{"text":"Food is good here, the place looks good too. I like the live performance here, they play blues all night long! However, the price is kinda expensive :("}
{"text":"Oh god (sorry, I'm athiest), make it stop.   I'm not sure who is going to this, but they must all be religious. That's the only reason I can see for all these great reviews of this place. YIKES.  The food was, like most have said, just okay. It wasn't anywhere near special and the price was over the top to have a sad buffet. The food was just warm. It wasn't hot, the bacon wasn't crispy, the mac 'n cheese lacked any sort of distinct flavor, the drinks were watered down. I'm so disappointed.  BUT, I could have dealt with that, I went really for the music. I was raised in a Southern Baptist household (the forced religion thing led me to stop believing in anything, hence atheist) so the music, while yes, religious, is something that I have deeply fond memories of. The jubilation, the reverence, it all moves me. Or did, until I got here.   What the heck? The songs weren't traditionally gospel. They were made up, I think. The woman singing talked more than she sang, and when she did sing her voice was scratchy and lacked something. The only song I recognized was Amazing Grace and that lasted far longer than it should have. I just wasn't impressed and I think my background in gospel singing is well established. I was hoping for something less showy, more reverent and got this really whacked out stage show that didn't have much to do with any gospel I've ever heard and it was just sad. I went hoping to be moved and instead left early. And, they seemed like they wanted to convert people. I understand that it's a 'gospel' show, but I came to hear singing, not preaching. It was almost offensive, I expected them to start passing the plate at any time. Did I mention I was SO disappointed? I was so disappointed.  There are a lot better places to spend your money on music than here. This seemed like a put on circus act. I was so disappointed. AND, it was expensive! Boo!"}
{"text":"Let's try and act serious for writing a review for the House of Blues. seriously I'm not kidding and stop talking to me like a jerk from Spinal Tap and Columbus Day. Rock and roll in cleveland, now what the )))  I am not fond of the entertainment  area. Area looks similar to the game Plinko from the television gameshow, 'The Price is Right'. I watch kids line down Euclid in October for Marilyn Manson or $katepunk, tee shirts and shorts that security must frisk every last Alice Cooper before the gym class. I have visions of firing squads lighting up into all of these bastards. Do not have interest for what is inside yet I have visited inside. I saw Ghostface Killah from Wu Tang and he autographed my ticket. That was actually amazing. Okay actually I have been to HoB few times, not terrible. I am waiting for karate  continental drift the neon bowling lanes and the lights and pyrotechnkks, and sound of the House of Blues, the Greenhouse Tavern Weezer songs and pig heads for become one barf."}
{"text":"Food and service were really good. I had the bbq bacon burger. Best burger I've had out in a while. I'd give 5 stars but I think it was a bit pricey. $14 for the cheapest burger seems a bit much to me."}
{"text":"The restaurant portion is meh. Can't say I'm fan of much of anything there. Meh drinks and beer list. Meh food. Meh service. Meh ambiance.   What does redeem the restaurant area is the Rockstar Karaoke (currently on Friday nights at 10:00pm). Live band karaoke is the best. The host is so-so, but it moves along quickly and lots of folks get a chance to sing. And the band is pretty good.  So in sum, skip the food, but come for some karaoke."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant and got sat and had a great experience from the moment my boyfriend and I sat down. Marissa saw that we weren't greeted by our server yet and got us waters right away. Later my boyfriend accidentally spilled some water and Marissa was on top of it to wipe it down for us and didn't even make us feel bad about him spilling it. The best part about all this is she wasn't even our server during our meal. Thanks for the awesome food and service, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre this time around.  I had the bacon avocado eggs Benedict with a side of chorizo.  Bacon was a bit tough, avocado over ripe, and the chorizo was bland with some grit.  My wife had twisted up with a side pancake and she liked it all.  Service from Jason the waiter was very good; he had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE WORST service I have ever had. Well, actually none!  I ended up leaving. There were only about 10 customers in the whole restaurant other than the bar for happy hour. All the staff was walking around like they had nothing to do!  Management needs to do an overhaul as I see other posts about crappy service and crappy food!"}
{"text":"Went to house of Blues for my daughters birthday dinner. The waitress forgot to put in our order. No big deal, we waited longer. Then when it came out messed up 3 of the 5 entrees. Mine wasn't a big deal, I asked for a bed of lettuce instead of a bun. I took it off. They put the wrong sauce on my boyfriends chicken wings,  no big deal, he ate them. But my daughter asked for a salad minus the blue cheese as she hates blue cheese. By the time the waitress came back to check on us everyone was done. We had snacked and gave my daughter some of our food and by this time were ready to go. I told her about the mistake and asked for them to give her the correct salad she ordered, but \"to go\" and with dressing on the side, so that she could eat it later. The waitress smiled and said \"no problem\" and I tipped her 35% on a $140.00 bill. When we got home we found that they just threw the salad we returned into a \"to-go\" box as it was, a soggy old salad, with the blue cheese and all.  I am a very cool person, admire and have much respect for people working in the food industry. We were understanding when the waitress made several mistakes, but this crosses the line. All I was asking for was what I ordered and payed for. Such a shame and embarrassment for a restaurant on E 4th area in the city I am proud to call my home."}
{"text":"Came here for a Bastille concert, the venue is what you expect to hold 500 or so ppl. There's a seats upstairs and tables through the place. Place is clean and they had a nice bar to buy some drinks. The concert was great but that's a different story. Overall, a nice concert venue. It can get a little crowded but that's expected."}
{"text":"My mother always insists that we eat here when she is in town. I'm always hesitant to go, and then end up licking my plate as if I hadn't seen fried chicken before. They have these catfish things that they fry and give you little shoestring sweet potato fries with them. So yummy! I order the fried chicken because I'm of the mind that if you eat at a southern inspired place, you eat the native things. It is always surprisingly good. Would I order a Cesar salad here? No, but the things that they specialize in are gooooooood!!"}
{"text":"Food: excellent - had the fried shrimp and catbites (in the bar during happy hour), chicken wings and fries in the restaurant. Service: consistently excellent - Jessica and Grecia were both outstanding Ambiance: very upbeat. Clean. The bathrooms were well kept  even during the busy times."}
{"text":"Worst service i've had in a long time. The service probably would have been better at DIcks.   We never even got served water. i had to go to the bar across the casino to get a glass of water. Why do you have so many people on staff if they cant even serve a restaurant that is half empty ?"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with two friends after teaching a workshop all day.  Ashley R. made the evening marvelously relaxing and fun.  Her service was outstanding, personable, professional, efficient and caring.   The food was great for all three of us and the atmosphere for MNF was great."}
{"text":"Just left The Dan Band show at house of blues.  Unfortunately we didn't get to see the show, we went at ticket time and gave up after 1 and 1/2;hours.  Overcrowded with big vip all u can drink section empty.  They are getting $24 for 2 cans of PBR.  Can you say gouging?"}
{"text":"Pro: Free Blues night Saturday.  Con: $19 for halibut pasta special.  The plate was decent enough but not outstanding, rum and coke for $6 was a better deal.  If it weren't on the Strip, this would be a pretty chill place to hang, grab a drink with a buddy and some decent grub.  I liked the act on stage, had a lot of heart and wicked shreds (8 string bass!).  Somebody mentioned that the speakers are too loud, I did find this to be an issue, but not so much to make it un-enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have been to a fair share of HOB venues in my teen years, and I have to say that the one in Las Vegas really lives up to reputation for the city that never sleeps! The artwork and design of the venue is amazing, they really went all out for this location. It is slightly smaller than the others I've been to, but that makes for a better show experience- plus, they have a second level for those who were lucky enough to get seat tickets! Haha.  You can tell I'm not of a Pit Girl, but it doesn't get over-crowded at this venue. Unlike the other HOB locations I've been to, the LV location is smart about their capacity limits. I was in the pit the whole time and never felt suffocated or violated (without my discression-h ey it was a  Marilyn  Manson concert, OK? I've been into the guy since I was a pre-teen!) Anyway, crowd control was amazing, the show was amazing, and the bar was- eh.   The bar. I paid $14 for a sprite. It was supposed to be a midori sour cocktail, but it just tasted like sprite, and for a person who DOESN'T drink very often didn't even affect me whatsoever. Weak drinks. Pre-game in your hotel room before hand. Your little sister can probably mix better drinks!  I would definitely see another show here, it's so convenient, comfortable and relatively on schedule. The only thing I HATED? This was the only venue I've EVER been to that did not allow a closed bottle of water- and I have a hydration issue!!!"}
{"text":"Saw umphrey's McGee there last weekend. It's your standard house of blues which is a good thing. Not a bad seat in the place. Staff was professional and bar service was efficient. I love these venues and will always support them whenever I can"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like HOB? It can be crowded if you don't go early enough, but for the shows that I want to get up front I end of doing the \"front of the line\" dinner deal at the HOB restaurant."}
{"text":"4 stars based solely on the venue set up.  I really liked the balcony seats - we were in row A and could easily see the stage without having to stand on the floor all night long.  The decor is quite interesting too..when you're looking for something to entertain you because the 2nd opening band is rubbish. What I did not like was how freaking cold it was in there! I was wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and a jacket and I shivered throughout the entire show.  I actually bought a long sleeved t-shirt from the merch table because I couldn't handle being that cold any longer!...Maybe that was their evil plan?? The drinks were super expensive but I think we can all expect that from any venue."}
{"text":"5 Stars??!! For the Vegas HOB??!!  Really?  Yeah.... here's why.....   My wife and I stay in Vegas way too much. We love Mandalay Bay.   Invariably, I check out who's playing the HOB downstairs, plunk down the money (generally a great deal) and go see a band of which I have a passing interest.  I've been blown away by some bands (Porcupine Tree) and pleasantly surprised by others (Joe Satriani, Styx, Flogging Molly) Some have been a drunkin mess. (I'm looking at you, Joe Rogan)  All have been entertaining."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  This venue sucks for live shows. Here is a break down on how a $20 costs about $100 every time 2-$20 tix + fees                                         = $54 Parking                                                      = $10 Double Vodka Cranberry and 1 tall PBR  = $22 Tip                                                             =$   5                                                                 ________                                                                      $91 NOTE: thats just with one round of drinks SIDENOTE: The sound and view suck THE BREAKDOWN: SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC VENUES AND NOT CORPORATE AMERICA.  Go to Brothers Lounge, Beachland, Grog Shop, Etc etc but save yourself from this crap."}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour with half price appetizers and drink specials. There was a guy playing acoustic guitar who was pretty good in my opinion. One of the girls who worked there said it was there pretty much every weekday performing during Happy Hour. It was a nice addition to the experience.   We had:  -margarita pizza (just OK- I've had better)  -spinach dip (good but served with a sort of potato chip like thing that I didn't care for)  -chicken wings on a bed of coleslaw (I guess the wings were small but flavorful and the coleslaw was average is what was reported to me since I do not eat meat)  -Voodoo Shrimp (excellent--served with cornbread and it was yummy!)   For 3 of us and we each got a drink special it was less than $50 so for Vegas it was pretty reasonable and we left full!"}
{"text":"First of all we have had meals here several times. We like the place. Service - always prompt - I particularly enjoyed the convenience of on line reservations. Wait staff always polite and prompt.  Food - GOOD, not great chain fare. I remember the fired chicken as being larger when we had dinner here about two years ago. My wife had some sort of blackened fish - adequate. Drinks - the usual overpriced glass of wine. It's the Strip  Ambiance - eclectic Seventies reflecting Sixties look with stuff on the walls, pictures of musicians and the odd autographed axe. Cute., Sort of a Soft Rcok Cafe. I'm partial to darker lighting - I am not disappointed at HOB  Value - actually, for an on-the-strip place the price is not bad considering we were full when we left and the food was good.  Good place. We'll go there again."}
{"text":"You have to go when there is an artist performing for dinner. But don't expect to have a conversation with your meal. But it's okay because the music that they play here is awesome. :] Even though it's not a well known band, they choose their musicians well. Also, if you have MyVegas, be sure to use your points and get free foooood :] they allow more then one voucher at a time, so it's a great break after a rough night of gambling."}
{"text":"I paid for TPain tickets and I had to endure and hour and 30 minutes of whack a** bands... I definitely would not have purchased the tickets if I woulda known that the opening acts would be almost the whole show. Will not do this again."}
{"text":"Street Tacos. Not exactly from a taco bus, it had cheese on it which I should of had omitted just to keep with authenticity but sometimes I just want to try food they way it's on the menu. I ate all 3 of them and had a bite of the blue cheese burger if there is one. Otherwise I guess I forgot what that was. Thumbs up from this little eatin' machine."}
{"text":"Honestly I can say I have only given one star to anything else on Yelp but I have to give one star to this gospel brunch due to the fact the seating is absolutely horrific.  To pay as much as I did for two people to be seated in a can of sardines is just disturbing.  I understand that this is all about Christian fellowship but I don't want to smell my neighbors arm pits while I'm trying to listen to music.  The food wasn't all that either.  I understand the House of Blues is trying to make as much money as they can and packing them in like cattle is one way of doing it.  Just not classy or professional though.  Just a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The HOB is a great place to eat before the show, service was fast, the food surprised me with the flavor, very well presented great flavor. My first time, would definitely return to try out the menu in the future."}
{"text":"After going to the house of blues in las Vegas a few months prior and enjoying it we figured this would be a safe bet , we requested a table outside and were seated immediately ,our waiter Christopher was absolutely great ,he knew the menu very well and took the extra time to answer our questions and was friendly and went out of his way to give us great service .We ordered a burger and a prime rib sandwich which was very good .After our meal we went inside and had a beer at the bar and had a nice conversation with the 2 female bartenders who were great too .Kudos again to Christopher and the house of blues !!!"}
{"text":"While walking through the Mandalay bay we stumbled across the house of blues so we thought we would give it a try , we ordered a few drinks and appetizers ,the food was very good but we were disappointed that our order took almost 40 minutes to arrive .Our waitress was very apologetic and she even sent the manager over and he too was very apologetic, yet he offered nothing to make up for the extremely long wait .Other than that it was a nice experience in a very nice atmosphere !"}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for Kirk Franklin Sunday Brunch  Check for groupon deal- I used mines during my dine experience ($50 for 2 ppl) and it was great! though I would pay full price for it!   Let me be clear, Kirk Franklin himself is NOT there but he does make appearances here and there to all of his locations... If you are coming to see him, good luck! but, if you want a soulful experience with GREAT food and entertainment, please go here!  Getting in the place: Because we had purchased out tickets in advance (THANK GOD) the line for us was shorter. Once the doors opened we were in there pretty fast. We were given a little tid bit on what was offered, where we could find it and released to do our thang (get our food). lol  The food: AMAZING. Fresh Fruit, carved turkey, ham, baked chicken, friend chicken, made to order omelette, fresh waffles, biscuits etc Any type of eater will find something to their liking.  The performers: AMAZING... interactive with the audience and I really felt that I was at church. The song choice was on point and everyone on stage had a great voice.  I can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok and they charged us an entry fee did eating there. We sat by the bar and they charged that I felt that was too much. We didn't receive great service yet were charged extra."}
{"text":"Other than the decor this restaurant is very average. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads. I had the Rueben with sweet potato fries. I could have gone to any other place and spent half as much and had just as good food. If you come here you many just want to opt for a drink and save your money to get food somewhere better."}
{"text":"Happen to come here for Santana.   The venue seems to be small for the rock concert and has a weird layout.  Friends of ours bought the tickets so I can't complain but the arrangement of the club seems to be too vertical to be useful.  From the top level you can only see the top of the performers heads and though the sounds is good given where we were sitting we might as well put on a CD in the comfort of our own home.  The entrance doesn't seem to be well positioned and the security arrangements start right at the entrance to the restaurant rather then away from it as I would expect so everyone who haven't been here before would go and ask the hostess on whether or not Santana was playing here.  Overall I think that this venue needs a little bit of rearranging but it is pretty functional with bars and everything."}
{"text":"Every time I have been there, the atmosphere is great the service is consistent and friendly, and the food is amazing! I have yet to go there and get bad food or shitty service."}
{"text":"I've been to this venue several times so it kind of shocks me that I have yet to review it... but then I remember that every experience there has been mediocre.  The bands themselves have been fine or better, don't get me wrong.  It's the venue itself that just makes it miserable.  It's pretty cramped and the pillars make it pretty obnoxious to see anything if you are slightly off to one side or another at all.  Drinks are expensive, but that shouldn't shock anyone since it's on the Strip.  The sound is really what makes me disdain this place.  It's just so... awful.  You pay decent money for a ticket to go here because it's House of Blues plus it's Vegas plus it's usually a rather known band.  And for what?  Sub-par, barely-better-than-the-local-bar sound?  Tiny little TVs so you can (barely) see what's happening on-stage?  Pushy bathroom attendants?  All of this combined really makes me hate going here.  Ever.  Even when it's one of my favorite bands that I have seen several times in other venues.  They sound jarbled and muddy.  I don't know if it's your sound system or your sound crew, but seriously - fix it."}
{"text":"Not only great for concerts, but breakfast is the bomb. Fast service great food. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our last day for breakfast.   All House of Blues locations are usually eclectic in decor and that's great. It was just so dark in there!  I knew I wanted french toast. But I saw other things on the menu that I wanted, so without blowing my budget, I had to come up with a plan. I got the 3 egg omelet with andouille sausage, onion and bacon. YUM. It was chock full of ingredients and they weren't just hidden between the folds of the eggs, they were bursting from the seams. It was so delicious and filling AND I had a side of french toast from the kids' menu!   Our server was a bit scattered. He was nice, though. My cousin didn't like his response, though when she asked what they had to drink. Sometimes you just want to know if a restaurant has coke or pepsi products. He asked her what she'd like to drink and her question was \"what do you have?\" He pointed at the bar -- and that was his answer. Obviously there's a bar, but what else is there? Anyway, I had coffee-- and it was good, too."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a beer, but the food is pretty average. Not terrible, but nothing special. I had their shrimp in a gumbo sauce on a jalapeño cornbread. It was ok."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this venue since 2009. It's a great place for concerts. Large enough to have great sound and crow vibes: small enough to feel like you're really part of the show.  I saw Billy Idol's residency show and chose to upgrade to VIP seating. I was not disappointed. The food is amazing. The service is stellar.  I don't frequent concerts, but from now on, when I do, it will be at a HoB!"}
{"text":"sometimes when a certain city comes to mind you automatically know whether or not you think its worth visiting. well, i guess im going to be the first to tell you that cleveland is actually an awesome place to party. maybe it had to do with the fact that i was only stopping through for warped tour, but the fact of the matter is, i met the most amazing  people here... which is why im going to start off by reviewing HOB cleveland. we rolled into town around 2am and parked in front of the caves stadium. later than night we hit up HOB for a couple drinks and dinner. we sat next to this older couple who were cool as fuck because they bought us rounds of jager and didnt mind that we were being total drunks. our waitress started doing shots with us and at that point i knew where to take this party. we moved to the bar and chilled with all of the bartenders. about 40 shots later they were closing up and i asked her ...\"what is there to do in cleveland?\"  ...it was a million dollar question because this girl took us out to every club and every bar in cleveland. id say this was one of the most memorable spots we hit on tour!!! oh..yeah... the food isnt bad... its like a hard rock cafe...  so four stars for the awesome friendly service, the drinks and the vibe"}
{"text":"the only times i have been here were for the shows during punk rock bowling. and every time i had a blast. i think the best show i saw here was me first and the gimme gimmes... the sound is always on point and the crowd seemed really chill... but then again how would i know, i was chillin vip with the bands.. hahaha.. suckers!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family last night & I was very impressed! The food is delicious, our server was amazing.. It was very busy but our server was wonderful! Live music was really nice also. I had the steak salad w balsamic vinegerette for my dressing choice, it came with grilled asparagus, potatoes, and it was to die for! In my salad it had some cornbread croutons, mouthwatering!! They have good drink prices I highly recommend the Watermelon Slammer it was my fav!! You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"This is where i get my ribs in vegas, plus their pulled pork sdwh is very good too if you want to be civil and not tear off rib bones that might mess up the clubbing gear.  The sauce is good, of course i ask for more on the side, they actually warm it up, and boy does it make a difference.  drench it.  don't forget that rosemary, I just wandered in one time, and i've been going back whenever im in town.  However, the ribs seem a lil small, i can prob kill 2 racks. but its vegas, and i didn't expect good ribs here."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict.  The Canadian bacon was rubbery.  The English muffin was difficult to cut through. The eggs were almost cooked all the way through, providing very little yolk.  The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce.  The hash-browns were soggy, watery and bland.  The dish reminded me of sub par cafeteria food.  On a lighter note I did enjoy the cheddar biscuits.  The service was outstanding.  For $25 you are probably better off going to the buffet or the cafe."}
{"text":"Great place, but it is a pretty small venue. The Walk the Moon concert was 16+ but there was no security walking around making sure that kids weren't using drugs (which they were) or that no one was dehydrating, etc... Also, it was HOT in there! I know that it's a concert, but it was musty in there. I'd definitely think twice before seeing a show here again."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:20 maybe (darn, just missed happy hour!) and asked the hostess for her opinion: we had a show to catch at 7:30, would we have enough time to eat here or should we go somewhere else? She said we'd be fine and that it usually takes 45 minutes so we got seated.  We asked our waitress about the Yelp deal that gives you a free appetizer with order of an entree and she said she'd have to check with her manager first because they might only accept printed coupons. C'mon hon, it's a deal that you get from checking in on Yelp with your mobile phone, if you expect people to print this out then I'm going to yell at you. So when she comes back she ends up saying that she thinks it's okay but another waiter is taking over our table so when we pay, we can just bring up the deal to him. I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer and BF got one of the sandwiches (I think chicken) with sweet potato fries upgrade. Then we waited and waited and waited. Our waiter had already refilled our water glasses twice and then as we continued to wait, I think he just started to avoid our table altogether. At maybe 7:10 I finally just stopped him and asked how much longer our food would be and he said he would check. He came back with our food and I asked for the check and had to ask about the Yelp deal all over again.  BF's order did not have sweet potato fries, no way did we have time to exchange it though. As irritated as I was, when we began to eat it was kind of like \"okay, well this is pretty yummy..\" That's pretty much the only thing saving them in this review because I'm still so irritated by the communication between workers and the service overall. Yes they were friendly but geez. The hostess knew we were in a rush but never bothered to let our servers know? And when you switch out servers you should be updating the server replacing you about anything regarding the table, don't tell the customer to re-explain something to the new server. I understand our situation was a little different because we were in a rush to begin with but if we were going to wait that long just to receive the food, I would've appreciated being told at the door that I should consider eating somewhere faster.   Most dishes are overpriced but the Yelp deal did make it worth eating there so thanks Yelp! Rather unpleasant experience but the food was not to blame"}
{"text":"WU-TANG!!!! Hell yes!! The place was smoky and gross and close and sweaty just like a venue should be! Plus you can slip it without tickets if you grease it nice and pretty, or, in my case, have your bodyguard do it. So close to the stage everyone could smell method man's blunt."}
{"text":"At Mandalay Bay, breakfast options are buffet, Seabreeze Cafe, or HOB.  I am not a fan of MB Buffet and service at Seabreeze tends to be incredibly slow even when it is not busy   During my 3 night stay, I ate at HOB each morning.    No fuss standard weekday Breakfast special Two Eggs, Hash, Bacon, Toast is perfectly portioned, fresh, and excellent value for strip standards.  Coffee is good.  Skip the overpriced OJ.      No wait.  Quick Service.    Occasionally you can also find 2 for 1 coupons in Las Vegas Advisor and MyVegas."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, but the gospel portion wasn't what I expected.  I thought we were going to be able to see some major choir action, but it turned out to be a small family singing group who's lead vocal kept looking at his watch to see how much more singing he needed to do. I think they sang a total of 5-6 songs (or, that's what it felt like). As Kayla B. mentions, the set was really short (about 30 minutes). I wish I had seen Kayla's review before I went.  In any case, I wanted to echo her thoughts."}
{"text":"This is my go-to music venue. Best staff, audio, stage, atmosphere and overall set up! Their is a great restaurant attached as well that serves amazing southern creole/cajun food, they may have the best Jambalaya ever.  I have been to the HOB cleveland at least 40 times now and its never disappointing. Cheap Valet off of 4th street and pass the line is a great way to start.  My wife and I love the HOB so much we decided to get married in the Cambridge room (to the left of the box office). The wedding package was amazingly cheaper than I thought, less than 4 grand with food/venue for 50ppl. Rachel Rosen was phenomenal with setting everything up too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Venue Review!  I love, love, LOVED this place! It's inside the Mandalay Bay . My bf and I were staying at NY, NY and walked from there to HOB. But don't be like us, take the tram from Excalibur, it'll save you some walking/exercise. ;)  We were there to see Brandon Flowers. Going in was quick and easy. The staff was helpful in getting us to our seats. As soon as we got seated we went to the bar and the bartender was REALLLLLY nice! I asked her to suggest a drink for me (something fruity and peach-y but still kinda strong. ;) ) She mixed something up for me then told me that if I didn't like it then she would give me something else, no charge. Luckily, I LOVED it. ;)  Brandon Flowers put on a great show (OF COURSE ;) ) my only complaint that from where we were sitting, it was really difficult to see him when he was in the center or on the right of the stage. We could only clearly see him when he was on the left. =/  Leaving the show was also not really pleasant. There was only ONE exit!! o_O It took us a good 10 minutes just to get back out to the casino again. =/   Overall though, I really enjoyed myself. :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been to Vegas so many times and never hit the Gospel brunch.  This is such a fun way to kick off a Sunday in Sin City. The singers know their gospel and they get everyone in the venue on their feet, clapping and singing.  The brunch was the best we've had In Vegas and at $50 head it's a steal considering the show is basically a freebie.  Bloody Mary bar?  Check. Chicken and waffles?  Check.  Best Mac n cheese in the world? Check.  You gotta check this out"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food and service was OK. Martini was excellent. Prices reasonable.  I would return again if in the area."}
{"text":"While here in Vegas at the Mandalay we have come to HOB three times. Just warm, friendly, and reasonably priced. Today for brunch we had a waiter named Adam and he is hands-down one of the best waiters I have ever had. Just a great guy -warm, informative, welcoming. Don't hesitate, just go and ask for this Adam!"}
{"text":"House of blues is house of blues!!! There's no changing that, EVER! Awesome concerts & events here.  Almost exactly the same as the ones in California. It is inside of the casino itself, but it's a pretty large yet intimate showroom, comparing to t-mobile arena (which is cool but an arena) HOB makes any show more intimate which leaves room for audience participation.  The other side of this they have a restaurant which also has a small stage and they host  a lot smaller concerts here."}
{"text":"There are so many things wrong with the House of Blues I'm not sure were to start. First ticket prices are out of control, I understand that it's a smaller venue and bands need to charge more but it still seems like there are a ton of service fees. Drinks are are the same price as Browns games (equally a disappointment) and they REALLY NEED TO GET RID OF THE BATHROOM ATTENDANTS! There is nothing I hate more than having to give/tip someone a buck or two to use soap and a paper towel! C'mon man give me a break! It really sucks that I'll be going back there because this is the only medium size venue in Cleveland for bands to play. If the Agora or the Odeon were still around this joint would have some competition and it might not be so bad. One good thing is the place is clean."}
{"text":"If you ever get a chance to see one of your favorite bands at the House of Blues,  DO IT. The venue is the perfect size to see an intimate show from general admission or the paid seats. The energy in the place is awesome and infectious. The only knock I had was the somewhat small bathrooms and the ridiculously overpriced drinks. These weren't enough to take off a full star, so my true rating would probably be a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The day after partying, 14 dehydrated drunks waited 20 minutes to get water. The cup of gumble was horrible but the burger was good. Probably not going back their for awhile."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Luxor and stumbled upon The House of Blues while browsing around the walk way thats connected to Mandalay Bay.  It's a great lunch spot, its dimly lit with very nice decor.  The staff is laid back but really professional and attentive.  I had a cajun chicken sandwich and fries, it was reallllyyyyyyyyyy yummy.  Be sure to go there for lunch, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I saw Tom Waits perform here.  (I love that sentence.)  THE UP-SIDE:  I saw Tom Waits perform here in a rare concert appearance.  He came on around 1 AM.  It was magic.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  How can there ever be a down-side if Tom Waits performed here.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  I saw Tom Waits perform here, and it was good."}
{"text":"Icona Pop on Sunday!!  Fun Fun Sunday!   .... \"I love it\""}
{"text":"Had dinner at house of blues.  Service was decent and pretty quick.  Food looked good but was very bland. Recommend you carry salt, pepper, and what eve spice you like on your pocket.  But to be fair, I'm from Louisiana and most food outside my state is bland, no flavor.  Of course it's very loud, but not bad overall."}
{"text":"This is a venue revue:  After seeing some shows in the new massive Joint at the Hard Rock - coming back to the cozy House of Blues was a refreshing change.  The venue is a really nice size in which to see bands - not too big.  The sound ranged from horrid - with the bass and kick drum so loud in the mix you literally feel like you're being given sonic CPR  - to great, all in a single evening.  We went for a rock and roll show, and although it took some time to get the guitars up in the mix where they belonged, once they did the sound was awesome - better in the back near the bar than on the floor I have to admit.  I'm docking one point for the OUTRAGEOUSLY high priced drinks!  $26.00 for a bourbon & coke and a Stella?!? EEESH!  Get your drink on somewhere else before the show if you must."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas recently for my birthday and we decided to have a snack to break us away from gambling for a bit. The main draw was the happy hour specials for appetizers at $6 a pop.   Upon walking in, I immediately enjoyed the interior. There was a lot of interesting things to look upon, including a gargantuan fake tree. Also, a musician started playing acoustically, which was unexpected and made the experience more fun.   When the food arrived, we were very pleasantly surprised with the portions because we weren't expecting so much for the money we were paying. We enjoyed the spinach dip with kettle chips and the shrimp with cornbread. The cornbread was SO good and the sauce they put on the plate was a big hit with all three of us. Definitely my favorite. The wings were just average. We ended up not even finishing all of the apps, with the exception of the shrimp dish. Not bad for 18 bucks betwixt 3 people!"}
{"text":"We hit this place right after it opened. Quiet and dark, with a really cool outside vibe while inside, with a giant tree. The service was good, and they give you huge carafes of drinks. The basic burger is just a build it yourself, but it's handmade. And it's a doozy. It's like dad used to make on the grill. It's huge. The chicken strips are hand breaded and delicious. The Mahi tacos came out cold, and the after mentioning it to the manager who came out to apologize, they took it off the bill. Overall pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Great facility! Never had the food here. Only come for concerts. It's located within the Mandalay Bay on the casino floor. Very easy to find once you find the center casino floor. Really cool memorabilia throughout. Anyway, came to see an icon play last night: CARLOS SANTANA. Phenomenal show in a phenomenal, intimate, and cozy venue. There's a restaurant with a stage, a music hall (where concerts are held), and a store. The music hall has food options and a few bars"}
{"text":"I've been here now for more than a few concerts (Matisyahu, Girl Talk, K'naan + Wale) and have no complaints.  I hate large venues and I love that I can sit in the balcony, easily grab a drink and enjoy the concert without having to push and shove my way through a mosh pit or spend three hours straining my neck and my calves to see the performers on  stage (I'm 5' 3\" so this is a big deal!)  Also, I live right on Euclid so it's great to be able to just walk over and grab tickets for shows and avoid evil Ticketmaster and their insane service charges."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but cool as hell. Kinda like the blue bayou at disneyland in atmosphere (trying to create an outdoor, southern atmosphere inside) but with actual solid interpretations of southern classics.   Service is spotty but, hell, you're in a casino and the chef isn't a celebrity.   Biscuits and gravy rock the party, but, predictably, you can only eat about one, since they are so rich. Still, yum yum.   Also, beans, rice and jambalaya kicked my ass. In a good way. Spicy, tons of protein, rice not cooked too much and hot sauce. Buh-bye hangover.   Best part? If you eat here for breakfast your receipt has a 2-1 offer for breakfast the next morning (Read: grub on biscuits and gravy for free. WORD!)  This is a great stop if you're in the Mandalay/Luxa/Ex area. :)"}
{"text":"What A Wonderful place to eat at, Happy Hour Was Awesome Food, Great Prices, And The Best Staff!!!!!!!!!!!! #MyBlueHairedSoleSister #MzC, You Sit In Her Section, She Will Take Great Care Of You, Awesome Personality, Great Recommendations, Knows Her Restaurant, And The Best It Has To Offer!***** And Awesome Staff Is Usally Ran By Awesome Mangers #MeganRocks..... THANK FOR TODAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the HOB for a Volbeat concert that absolutely rocked! The atmosphere, layout and decor was perfect. I really like the placement and size of the bars, the floor and the stage. My only serious complaints are the amount and strictness of security and the $$$. Beers were $13, that just ridiculous. Mixed drinks were tiny and no alcohol for $10. It was a rip off. Two drinks cost more than the tickets to the show. The security guards were everywhere a little too oppressive for a rather tame crowd. We had a great time so I'll give this place a 3 but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"we all felt sick after eating here.  service was friendly but slow.  gross gross gross"}
{"text":"I've seen many performances here... VNV Nation (har har), Spiritualized (heroin, anyone?), Stella (sloppy wet pizza), Peter Murphy (muahaha), Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (they rock out - too bad their c....oops, never mind) ... just to name a few.  Sound is great here. It's not too large of a space and almost feels intimate. Especially if you're lucky enough to snag a bar stool.  I'm giving 3 stars because of the ticket fee raping and because you get a frickin' tall boy PBR for $4 BUT a diet coke in a dixie cup for $3. Can I have some KY with that next time, please?   Also, the bathrooms are really nice but I hate feeling like I have to tip a bathroom attendant. I always do because I'm guilted into it (thank you Catholic school) and because I'm not a cheapskate. But seriously...  the bathroom attendants are the reason that the girl standing next to me last night smelled like Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth. My nose wanted that $1 that I left in the tip basket back for that one."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here all 5 days we were in Vegas. There are 3 reasons why I can't give this establishment 5 stars.  First, more than 2/3 of the restaurant tables were open when our group of 6 tried to get a table and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. 45 minutes?!?! How was that even possible?? The place wasn't even busy. We wound up smooshing together at a bar top table so we didn't have to wait so long. Second, the waitresses were soooooooooo SLOW! We had really great service the first day when we had 2 male bartenders that absolutely killed it in customer service but then the rest of the days we went here, it would take forever to order a drink or food or get our bill. There were 2 days when we just left cash because it would have taken ages to get our bill and run our card. Third, the pricing. Although the portions are larger, the pricing was still a bit steep for the quality of food.  I would absolutely go here again if I was staying at the hotel but wouldn't go out of my way to go eat here."}
{"text":"Ask for Angel for breakfast. Good service and character. Gave us comp entries to a nightclub and coffee in to-go cups when we left."}
{"text":"So far this has been one of the best places to eat at the Mandalay Bay resort.   I went there the first night here to have a drink and appetizer while waiting for my husband who was attending a conference. I sat at the bar and had wonderful service. Got wings with BBQ sauce served on coleslaw which were awesome and a full meal for me. Met up with my husband and returned for him to eat dinner. He got lobster Mac and cheese which was very good and rich. I had triple chocolate cheesecake which was great. There was a fight in the bar - added entertainment ;-) - which was handled by staff and security appropriately well.  I went back for breakfast this morning and had the super fuel omelet and fruit. Excellent. Service was good. Server was busy but friendly and attentive. Great coffee - Peet's !"}
{"text":"Santana was awesome. It's a small venue which makes it feel personal. It was poppin'. The next day we went to the gospel brunch. The food was terrific. The music was soulful & uplifting. My kinda place. It was the most fun I've had in Vegas. I'm looking forward to enjoying more music at this venue this time around in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice:  1) Dinner...don't remember what I got (the food was average, and forgettable, apparently).  I remember thinking, \"how can THIS, cost THAT much?\"  Tasty cocktails, way overpriced (I guess that's because it's in Vegas...).  2) \"Salsa dancing\" night.  The quotations mean they promote it as being salsa dancing, but really it just turned into a ghetto reggaeton dance club.  NOT what I wanted, and we had to pay the cover charge to get in...very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was great and reasonably priced.  The wait staff was great.  I only wish they stayed open a bit later so I could get food after 11pm when I'm staying at Mandalay Bay!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for food from the Happy Hour menu and it was marginal at beat.   Told by a server the kitchen was slammed but the main restaurant opened 15 minutes after we ordered.  2 thumbs down for service."}
{"text":"I've been to the House of Blues for a few concerts now, and there are plenty of other venues that offer a better sound quality, especially in Las Vegas.  If you have the opportunity to see a band at another venue, I highly recommend it. The sound quality is awful, so there will be a very low chance you'll understand anything coming out of the singers mouth. It ends up being just a muffle that fades into the rest of the band."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible for breakfast although we had a good burger there the night before. The hostess sat us in a corner because our waiter had a \"section.\"  I'll cut to the chase... the coffee was warm, my eggs were cold and came without sausage. When they arrived they were cold. My wife ordered a three egg omelet that was delivered cold. If there were three eggs in it they were robin's eggs because the omelette looked tiny. I didn't eat anything after the sausages were delivered the second time because (paranoid me, having worked in kitchens I don't trust them when you send food back. An old Japanese soldier, I admit, but I don't do it) the place skeeved me out.  Don't have breakfast there."}
{"text":"The food is ok, I would compare it to an Applebee's or Chiles ect. However I am sitting here right now being totally ignored by our server. I am not one to write reviews, I just don't ever do it. But I am irritated enough that here I am. This our second time here during our stay and the service has been horrible both times, and no they are not overly packed. (If your wondering \"why would you go back\" its simply because it is the most convenient location to our room, and we have kids) SUPER SUCKY SERVICE. BUMMER."}
{"text":"The main reason to come here is the cornbread, which is simply the best you'll find anywhere. Outside of that, the fare is very average. My baby back ribs were too stringy and didn't have enough meat on them andThe cook tried to compensate by over saucing them with a tangy sticky non spicy sauce.  The beans were good but the gumbo was utter crap! The service was nothing special either. Only come here if you're desperate for cornbread."}
{"text":"Nice location in Mandalay Bay. Good menu selections with high quality food. The happy hour prices are a wonderful value for very good items. We were very happy with the service as well and plan to return when we go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate at the House of Blues Restaurant on 9/12 and we had the NY Strip steak and Lobster Mac and Cheese.  The steak was good and served with carmelized onions, garlic real mashed potatoes and the vegetables were fresh green beans, water chestnuts and tomatoes.  We ate in the restaurant so we could skip the line because we had General Admission seats for the Mr. Speed and The Wanted concert.  At intermission I went outside to have a cigarette and when I came back in I expected to be wanded etc. checked for items not allowed. We have been here numerous times for concerts and I've never experienced a Security Guard who took my cigarettes out of my small purse, inspected my cigs. and he was rude.  This really upset me and my guy.  We may not return."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch  My friend had the burger & loved it  My salmon was ok nothing special.  The cookie was amazing.  Service was good"}
{"text":"Second concert I've seen here.  Both times I had a great time.  Quickly friendly bartenders tend to you quickly.  All seats are really good to see the stage.  I had VIP tickets which allowed me on the top floor with a private bartender so I had an even better time than most I imagine. :)  I'd see another show here for sure!"}
{"text":"Management from HOB did finally reach out. Faith in people restored."}
{"text":"I love this venue, but lately cosmo has more shows. So until they get indie bands to play here, I'll be at cosma. Plus cosmo has free concerts at book and stage."}
{"text":"AWESOME feel to the place. Came for breakfast. Creamer in the coffee was bad but the staff happily fixed it. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the children's portion of pancakes could feed an orphanage. Bloody Mary was decent and the music of course rocked."}
{"text":"House of Blues is part of the chain started by Dan Ackroyd. The big draw is the live music. Ambience at this location is nice - They have a nice tree right in the middle of the restaurant which makes it different. Tables are spaced out so you're not on top of one-another, but a negative is they play the music SO LOUD. At dinner, when you want to speak to people. Acoustics are slightly disadvantaged in here, I'm afraid...and that makes it difficult to hear your dining companions.   Our server showed up right away to take our drink and appetizer orders, but it took ages for her to come back. Someone ordered Tequila and she said the \"bottle was locked up\". Strange. Only one appetizer came out, and the next one came out 30 minutes later. Not acceptable, but the restaurant did comp it. It was the cheese artichoke dip which came out luke-warm. Not worth it, even if it was comped. The person refilling fountain drinks was very prompt however.   The menu. It's all soul food, and seemed very chain restaurant'y. I just had a feeling anything that looked interesting was going to be mediocre, so I had a hard time finding anything I wanted to eat here...so I ordered the fried chicken. It was decent, and not greasy...if unimaginative. Came with mash potatoes and slaw. Potatoes were heavy, slaw was good though. Others in my group ordered burgers or salads. Everyone said it was \"OK\".  Prices are reasonable for the food, but the food ain't that wonderful. Workmanlike is what I would say. Still, if you like live music and are on a budget, you could go worse. Needs a revamp IMO."}
{"text":"Gospel Brunch in Sin City is so edifying! Growing up in the South, the excellent music and vocals from the Desert Angels (http://www.desertangels.com/) brought back soulful and sweet memories of my upbringing. I was impressed that other Las Vegas locals were also in attendance. Glad there are people open to praising the Good Lawd above while feasting on a Southern-style buffet at the House of God... I mean, House of Blues."}
{"text":"Even with the many entertainment & dining options that Vegas has to offer - I always make sure to stop by HOB either for a great meal or a show (sometimes both).  There's a great variety of menu options - and very reasonably priced.  HOB has many nationwide acts - and periodic residency with Carlos Santana.  I felt the acoustics of the venue were great - and I like the layout - including the standing room area, bars on the side, and additional seating upstairs in the balcony area.  Very cool joint with great characteristics - and great food.  Definitely worth checking out when in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. I had the chicken street taco and sweet waffle potatoes. They were both very delicious. It was also reasonably priced.  Live music starts at 8pm. The only reason that I gave a 4 star was because our server had someone she was training and there were a few awkward moments (I felt she was a little bit rude) with the trainee.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Didn't like this place on a Sunday night. Really expensive beers and the music wasn't good blues. Seemed more of rock music. Plus there were a lot of weird paintings."}
{"text":"Best breakfast of our trip, thanks to the honest input of our server. After we ate, she took us on a tour of the performance area and VIP spots."}
{"text":"This is just for the food. I wish I could have seen a band here, but was in town for business and just didn't have time. I flew in from KC late Monday night (for my time zone) and missed dinner with my coworkers, so I decided to head out on my own. I was staying at Mandalay Bay, so I didn't have far to go to House of Blues. It's right in that complex.  I asked to sit at the bar. That's usually what I do if i am eating alone. You get seated right away, your server is never far away and the service is usually superb. I was not disappointed.  I asked the bartender for a light, savory gin drink. I can't remember what he called it, but it hit the spot. Then I asked what was good on the menu. Initially he said, \"Everything\". I said BS to that. Then he asked what I wanted - I said something light, it's late for me. So, he recommended the shrimp tacos.  The food came out pretty quickly. The shrimp tacos were really good. Lots of shrimp, nicely seasoned with a little kick. I asked for hot sauce, but all they had was Tabasco. That surprised me. Didn't this chain start in New Orleans? However, they had some sauce that really highlighted the flavor, so kudos.  I was out in less than an hour. Nice dinner. I'd go back - next time for a concert, hopefully."}
{"text":"More like House of SNOOZE! Get it?! (you get it).   I think Neko Case said it best when she was on stage here: \"I like the Beachland about 8000 times fucking more.\" (Yes, this is an actual quote, and yes Neko Case is this amazing (no duh)).   The HoB is the Applebee's of music venues (they even have kitschy garbage on the walls!) . So if you're into chain restaurants, you'll probably be into the HoB (a chain music venue); which, in all fairness, is FINE - we're all different people who like different things (though, I'm secretly worried about you).    During concerts, the HoB prices its drinks as if it were a sporting event, so get ready to pony up big time.   Also, for those of you who are not aware, House of Blues is owned by Live Nation, which itself has recently merged with TicketMaster (barf). With that in mind, it should come to no surprise that it engages in the deceptive practice of tacking \"Service Fees\" onto all of its ticket sales. Think you can avoid these fees by purchasing the tickets directly at the venue, instead of online or over the phone? Nope! They apply regardless of the method of purchase.   Under these circumstances, you would think that HoB could simply and honestly include their \"fee\" amount into the face-value of the ticket; but that would require HoB to not be the absolute worst, which it most definitely is."}
{"text":"I have never been treated like some livestock at the stockyards. The place was over packed, people standing on stairways and blocking emergency exits. God forbid one of the people smoking pot start a fire there would be multiple casualties. Not what time the concert was supposed to start but I'm sure it was late. I will no be back, and only hope other people are concerned about safety and think before you put your loved ones in danger."}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork sliders. They were very tasty and hit the spot. The margarita was ok. Nothing memorable, just a margarita. We ate in the bar to skip the wait. Service was good with some interesting (aka annoying) people watching. We would've gone back after our concert that night but food was shut down already."}
{"text":"I had dinner here Friday May 19th.  I ordered mahi mahi tacos that were either overcooked or past their prime as they were really tough.  To make things worse, the fish was covered with pepper which I think clashes with the natural flavor of the meat.  Beers were Vegas priced but cold.  The beer selection could be broader but, that's why you bring an ice chest to Vegas.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Yeah, so I saw the Scorpions here. So what? You judgin' me? HERE I AM...ROCK YOU LIKE A HURRICANE!!!  Speaking of hurricanes, I'm not exactly sure what the blue frozen thing I got from the bar was, but it was pretty good. I had about two or three or seven of them. Great venue for a show, but by the time I was done with the blue drinks, you could have put me outside by the dumpster and I would have had a blast.   Dinner, though fuzzy in my memory, was a sweet little rack of baby back ribs, mashed potatoes, greens, and a piece of cornbread the size of my face.  The dining room is, like, really big and confusing; make note of where you're sitting before you head off to the can.  Ok, so the Scorpions were having an off night, but I didn't care. Long as the HoB bartenders keep the liquids flowing, you'll have fun. Make sure your credit rating is solid before you tuck in for a long night."}
{"text":"Prices are high at this location but I guess what can you expect for Vegas. My family and I came on a Monday evening right before the 7;00 Cirque Du Soleil show. There was hardly wait, they just needed time to get our table together.   The food was ok. I went to the Orlando location and I felt the food was slightly better. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was ok. It was a little bland and I had a crunch of lobster shell, eww...and no it wasn't the panko topping. My brother ordered the ribs. The meat was tender but he complained of the lack of meat but other than that he enjoyed his dish. My dad ordered their 25 minute to cook buttermilk chicken (and they really do give you warning about how long it takes to cook). I had some and it was also just ok, not sure what all the wait was about. My sister got the pull pork sandwich and I was feeling greedy that night so I tried some of her dish as well. It was really tasty and I will definitely be trying this next time. Overall the food was ok and would be interested in trying out other dishes in the future. Sidenote...the sweet tea was so addictive, watch out!"}
{"text":"After a not so happy hour at La Strada, we went here instead because my friend said they got great food and a happy hour menu to look at. The hostess was attentive and listened. The wait staff was much better and Boy was it the best decision made. We had about ten minutes before it was over. They had $2 Blue Moons and 1/2 off appetizers. We ordered the catfish, chicken quesadillas, artichoke dip, and BBQ pizza. It was ten minutes before 7 so we ordered 4 beers altogether. That is what I call happy hour. Great food and drinks! The food was kinda like Southern Cajun food, the catfish and sauce was kinda spicy and the quesadillas had a kick to them. The pizza and dip was okay, I wasn't too much of a fan.   We sat out in the patio so we were able to enjoy the scene and people watched. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"3 reasons to go:  Happy hour till 7pm, $1 beers, $3 'cocktails' (as long as they're made of rum and rum only, bizarrely). Half price appetizers.   The food is excellent. Maybe we got lucky but the burger was excellent, as were the buffalo wings and the spinach dip. I didn't find it that overpriced for the quality (and quantity).   Hot waiters."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere and great staff! Sweet Potato fries were excellent as was the french dip."}
{"text":"As a music venue, the House of Blues makes up for the spectacular crapfest that the Joint at the Hard Rock is and I'm so glad it's made its way to Vegas.  I've seen countless acts here over the years.  The HOB is always quite good at booking more popular bands and then, every once in a while, they'll book someone I never thought would play Vegas and I just flip my wig.  Most of the time, the ticket prices are very reasonable ($20 - $30, including all fees) and they allow artists to sell their own tickets which is a lot more pleasant than dealing with big ticket sellers.  Drinks are pricey, but not as much so as other venues.  The sound is consistently good.  The levels in the general admission area make it possible to have a good view from just about anywhere.    I'm always checking the HOB site to see what shows are coming up.  It's a delight to see artists in this space."}
{"text":"My review is for the restaurant only.  Seeing all the fancy high priced restaurant in the Mandalay Bay, the House of Blues is a nice option.  Having said that, I've only been once.  The service was slow and the food was just ok.  I was hoping for more but with newer restaurants popping up in the casino or the shopping mall, I really don't find myself coming back here."}
{"text":"So, we went here before a show.  Got seated fairly quickly, and then were ignored for almost half an hour.  Then we finally ordered, and sat there for another forty five minutes.  During which time the server only spoke to us once.  She blamed the kitchen for the delay, but she still only talked to us twice in the hour and fifteen minutes we were sitting there.  Then she finally came back after we told her we were going to have to leave, and she informed us our ticket had been lost.   I wondered why she hadn't checked on it in the forty five minutes since we'd ordered, but whatever.   She said she'd get a manager over to us.  The manager said she'd get our food out in fifteen minutes or just give us our check.  Our check for two sodas and some cornbread.  I was fully expecting them to comp us the sodas or something, but nope.  Easily, from top to bottom, the absolute worst service I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"The House of Blues is an excellent venue for live music and performances. I recently visited it for Pole Show LA by Leigh Ann Reilly, talented pole dancer and owner of Bespun in Hollywood, CA. The show was fun, sexy, and hilarious. The show itself was a combination of Cirque de Soleil and burlesque shows. Professional pole dancers from all over the world including Russia, France, and U.K. joined American dancers to perform at House of Blues.   The venue has three sections: general admission, bar, and balcony seating. General admission (cheapest seats) was an open area where you stand and can get up close and personal with the performers. Bar seating was on the ground floor level with the bar with parties of 4 around individual tables. Balcony seating is the most comfortable and comparable to regular show seats at a vegas show and thus the most expensive. The seating selections are all very different so depending on what kind of mood you are in for the night, choose accordingly.  House of Blues is located in Mandalay Bay and super easy to find once you enter the casino. You won't miss the big House of Blues signs. I highly recommend this venue for a show or just some drinks to start your night. You can hop right over to the Shoppes to do some shopping, LIGHT to dance the night away or The Foundation Room for a breathtaking view of the Las Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Man, their drinks are thee best! We had a few rounds. Our waitress hooked us up! Our salads were delicious but the wings were just alright. Still had a good time and the bonus was our photo bomber smiled in our selfie. Didn't notice him in the background until later! Lol"}
{"text":"Great wait staff! Food was delicious and was served promptly. We had the fried chicken And loved it. Full stage set in the restaurant creates fun live music. Started at the bar for drinks and a big \"mahalo\" for the Hawaii bar staff! Nice to have Hawaii friends in different places. Will be back. Take the family!"}
{"text":"Great venue for concerts. If you ever get the chance to see a band you like at this venue, I suggest going!  Been here 3-4 times and never left upset!"}
{"text":"We just saw Carlos Santana . Tracy was our waitress and was the nicest , most responsive and coolest ever . She even talked with us after the show , after her she was done . Ridiculously enthusiastic about music and super sweet ."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised while staying at Mandalay Bay. Tucked in the back of the Casino floor, this location was clean, well lit (during the day) and featured friendly and very attentive staff. Definite recommend"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and cheese and cluck in good chicken - one of the best meals at Mandalay!!!"}
{"text":"House of Blues is the worst venue. We lined up for a concert at 10:30am the day of the show and got completely screwed over. The House of Blues resteraunt let people that ate there in before of us and they waited an hour!!!! To add to that, they promised us that they weren't doing that for this show. It was 35 degrees outside and we waited the entire day. Highly disappointed with this venue."}
{"text":"We wanted something quick and easy so we stopped in. The atmosphere is cool. Food was ok. We got the artichoke/spinach dip which was pretty good. Served with chips. I ordered a half caesar salad, i ordered regular grilled chicken and think they did blackened so i didnt loved it but it was ok. The regualr order is HUGE. My date ordered a chicken wrap and said it was pretty tasty. So it was good but nothing that blew us away."}
{"text":"Probably one of  my favorite and most frequented venues in vegas. I've seen some great bands and had some awesome times here. Tickets are about average , usually depends on what band you are seeing. The GA level is pretty large with lots of room for fellow concert goers. The bar staff is a friendly bunch. The Sound system is amazing here, always makes for a great show. The lighting is always on point and makes a great display. Security is pretty cool , however they get distracted when the pit goes off and some folks lose their cool. All in all though it's a great venue to see your favorite artist."}
{"text":"What can I say? The House of Blues Gospel Brunch is a great family oriented wonderful experience to be had by all!!  If you are a fan of HOB's famous Mac N' Cheese get it here! If you are craving a home cooked made to order omelet with fresh ingredients get it here!!! Plump juicy link sausages, savory bacon, southern biscuits with sausage gravy!! YUMMM!!   If you are interested in having lunch...juicy tender prime rib, spicy flavorful Chicken Jambalaya and one of the BEST Caesar's salads I have had in Vegas! The salad was crisp and the cheese was plentiful! Not like some of the limp soggy salads I have had in the past.   Now on to the show... energetic, uplifting and entertaining! The female singer could sing her way onto any singing competition and blow them all away! The band The Gastons (I believe that is correct) had some smooth dance moves! Very fun and leaves you feeling with a light heart.  The only reason they did not rate five stars is because on Mother's Day the wait staff seemed a little overwhelmed and we did not get a coffee pitcher refill and the mimosa's were very slow in coming. Other than that a great overall experience!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the House of Blues on 3 occasions, and I have never been dissapointed. Last weekend I went to the nightclub to see the 80's cover band \"Spazmatics\" for a friend's bachelorette party...The bands schtick is that they dress like nerds from the 80's, and they put on an amazing show, it was awesome! The band was great, I was dancing the whole time, the place has a really good atmosphere. We called and were put on the VIP list (the only way to go) so we had to buy a bottle of alcohol and we got a place to chill if we got tired. I liked the crowd, they weren't pretentious, and not too trendy. I would highly recommend this place if you want a cool place to dance, drink, hangout. It's a good mix of people, young, older, I danced with all kinds of people. Love it!"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant and was posted before they split HOB into music venue and restaurant on Yelp.    Happy Hour Daily 2-5pm  I came in for Happy Hour before going to see Billy Idol.  I love that they have happy hour every day, even on nights they have concerts.  Happy hour is 2-5 but on the night I was there they extended it until 7.  I am not sure how often that happens.  Maybe because it was show night?  I started with a Mango Mai Tai and then had a Pineapple Mojito.  Both drinks were very similar.  I am not sure they weren't the same drink.  They were good though and did the trick so no complaints from me.  I ordered the Cajun Popcorn Shrimp and Pretzel off the HH menu.  Both were OK.  Typical bar food that did the trick.  This wouldn't be my first choice for HH in Mandalay Bay but its great if you are on a budget or pregaming before a show.    In addition to their regular HH menu they have day specific HH specials.  Monday 1/2 off specialty margaritas, Tuesday $6 craft beer, Wednesday $5 bourbon and Thursday $5 Stoli."}
{"text":"Seriously good food! Can't wait to go back! We had TWO orders of their Jerk Chicken Wings and one of the Voodoo Shrimp. So good! Can't wait to go back! Great place to watch a football game too! Big Screen! Loved the decor also. Great place to hang out and/or take a date. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night before heading back home and was sorely disappointed. I had the babyback ribs which were somewhat tasty but fell below standards that even Applebees upholds. The fries were bland and the iced tea was at a point where not even a cup of sugar could salvage it. The service was so so and I found it obnoxious that they come and take your picture and then try to sell it to you while you're eating. I ate on the side without the music so it was very empty. It seemed like people were having a good time on the other side..but I'm sure it has everything to do with the music and nothing to do with the food."}
{"text":"I ambled over to Mandalay Bay yesterday and tried the House of Blues. I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was excellent and the food was very tasty. I had breakfast and found it filling, hot, and quick.  My only problem with the experience, and I have to say, it's just me, but it was dark and hard to see. All in all, a good choice."}
{"text":"It was nicely air conditioned.  The only downfall is lack of seating.  Most of the venues are standing only.  Not too great when you are standing for hours.  I probably would have stayed through the whole concert if I wasn't already standing during the opening act."}
{"text":"So I took a birthday trip to Vegas this week.   On the last night, we had dinner at here. And in all, it was ok.   Service: our server almost got all of the orders wrong, I ordered a New York strip steak, she almost brought me buffalo strips. That's not even on the menu, I said medium rare, she almost brought well done. I don't get how hard it is to hear me when there's no music playing at that moment and I'm looking right at you. She was wondering around on a not busy night, I had to get up and find her for the check.   Food: steak was great, mashed potatoes were creamy and tasted amazing, steamed veggies needed a lil salt but good either way.   Music: during dinner we caught a show called loop, one guy, playing all instruments, drums, guitar, using a keyboard with record and play back. The show was great, he played some great songs. From journey, to Bon Jovi, Stevie Ray Vaughan. It was really cool.  Other than the server, I liked it."}
{"text":"The place is amazing, location amazing, service is amazing....Jen kicked butt, but the food was pathetic!   Save your money on quality...I had ribs, Hulk Hogan couldn't  break them apart, my wife had a Shrimp Po Boy...dry as the desert around us in Vegas...no sauce and bread is bad....nothing like N'orleans.    Daughter had had a buffalo chicken salad and it was good.   Don't expect much for the price, hit the McDonalds drive through."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, the art is cool, and well... I'll be honest, there were lots of cute servers.  :)  The air was chilly, though, everyone in my group was uncomfortable.  We came in for lunch around noon on a Thursday.  Our drinks came quickly and our orders were taken in good time, the appetizer came in good time but then the entrees took almost an hour to come out.  They said it was the ribs that held everything else up but that didn't make a lot of sense to us; aren't ribs pre-cooked?  The ribs themselves were not a bad deal for a full rack at $24 but were very disappointing.  They were very fatty, they were like half fat and half meat.  I like ribs a lot but I don't like eating mouthfuls of fat.  The meat wasn't very tender, either.  We did really like the jalapeno cornbread which everyone agreed was \"weird... but good\".  So anyway, after all that wait for the entrees, by the time we ate and paid our checks, suffice it to say we were all very late getting back to work.  I definitely cannot recommend this restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"We were originally seated in Sec. 200 Row E, which is a side view of the stage and the sight lines were very poor. My girlfriend is 5'1 and could not see 80% of the stage. I could see maybe 50%.   When we asked an usher if we could possible move he simply suggested sitting elsewhere once the show started but we'd have to move if anyone owns those seat tickets.   I also spoke with the box office manager but was informed the show was sold out and all he could do was get us to general admission standing room only section.   We ended up staying in our assigned seats for the first 15 minutes and then moved to some empty seats in Sec. 204 handicap row. These were great seats and showed me that as long as your in the middle sections (204, 300, 400) you'll have a good view of the stage.   I would only go back if my seats were Center sections."}
{"text":"I've been here for concerts and shows but never ate at the restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out after watching The Lion King. We were pretty disappointed with the small menu and prices. Like many restaurants in Las Vegas, they charge you an additional tax for live entertainment. It's really difficult to carry on any kind of conversation with music blaring.  The service was great but the food was definitely not worth the price.  With entrees being approximately $20, I expected fairly good to large sized proportions. Not great food selections and the taste was alright. I feel like I would have been more satisfied from McDonald's.  I won't ever come back for the food."}
{"text":"House of Blues gets some of the best punk rock and indy bands out there. They seemed to pick up where the Huntridge left off.  Nothing in Vegas touches the Huntridge but HOB makes a good effort. The General admission  floor is the way a  a music venue should be.  The figging monster pillars are a pain in the ass for a music venue. The sound is amazing.  They need to get rid of the no studded belts, camera or chain wallets. You have a ton of punk rock bands playing there yet you ban the items they wear?? wake up! Joint, Pearl all allow cameras! How about no flash photography? No photos is just stupid.  You have  a great concept, you would get 5 stars if you would change some policies and chain saw those pillars out and put new hidden supports in! keep up the great music and tweek the policies. Otherwise and great venue.  Ticket prices are perfect! The restraunt I have eaten a few times and its solid but not amazing. Worth it to get something before or after the show but nothing amazing to go eat in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is the coolest!!  I LOVED the décor, the food, the vibe and every single thing in the adjoining gift shop, too...I could have spent hours up in there....  Came here for breakfast with my husband during our recent anniversary trip in Vegas.  What actually prompted us to eat in the restaurant was my stop in to buy one of their kick-ass t-shirts in the gift shop the day before.  When the girl gave me my receipt she said that if we brought it back the next day we could get 2-for-1 breakfast.  AWESOME!!  : )  So we came back the next morning and sat in their little bar seating area to have breakfast.  I ordered the Traditional French Toast and the hubby ordered a Breakfast Burrito that had eggs, chorizo, chiles, onions and cheese in it.  Both were SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD!!   Nothing particularly special in the preparation....just simply some tasty ass food!    The whole time we were there we kept checking out the cool paintings on the walls and all the Day of the Dead style skull décor...love that stuff.  We took a bunch of pictures, too.    I would love to come back again and try the Southern/Cajun style food they have for lunch and dinner....YUM....maybe check out a show there too!  ; )"}
{"text":"Wrong advertisement of concert start time. 1 hour late. Please be considerate of others esp if you are in standing section."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, it was southern comfort! Full with Mac and Cheese, Pull Pork Sandwich, Fried Butter Milk Battered Chicken and Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast. None had any complaints, just full stomachs!"}
{"text":"I was here on 1/15/17 to see and meet three bands -- Falling in Reverse, Issues, and Motionless in White. I got a picture with all three of them and they are very friendly people. :) They blew the roof off this venue. I was at the very front row, REALLY close to the stage and this lady comes up to us and hands us a free water bottle. I have to say, this was a smart idea as I was in the same spot for about four hours. I'm definitely coming back for more concerts in the future."}
{"text":"Entertainmently, this place is the bomb in Cleveland. You get to see your favorite bands up close and it's not very expensive. Food and drinks are a little expensive...expect to pay $4.00 for bottled water.  Corporately House of Blues is very strict when it comes to professional videotaping concerts. Only certain things can be taped for a certain time, if you are lucky. Professional photography seems to be the easiest way to get in with House of Blues if you're in broadcasting. Back stage passes aren't too hard as long as you can contact band managers. I've been offered upper floor seats with free food and drinks before for having press passes.  If you're looking to have a fun day in Cleveland, eat at the House of Blues restaurant, get front stage passes, then see Flogging Molly this February."}
{"text":"I was contacted by management a few times, a lot of small talk and placation, no real substantive effort to address my concerns in any way.  Worthless place, do not go here.  And if you do, take your chances"}
{"text":"Love this venue so much I take a road trip from Pennsylvania to attend concerts. They are one stop entertainment you can have dinner, drinks and see a show at the House of Blues Cleveland. They have good food and drinks in addition to a versatile line up. Love that they cover all genres of music with affordable tickets and some of the tickets are on Groupon for additional savings. I've had dinner and the jalapeno cornbread is outstanding. The Hurricane is good and you can buy shot glasses in the souvenir shop. They have an entrance from the restaurant to the concert venue. So it makes it very convenient to go enjoy the music. I have been to standing room and sat in the balcony for concerts. They are all great experiences so you can't go wrong. You can buy tickets online and use your smartphone or print them for concert entry. This is a great time so check it out then hit E 4th Street for additional drinks and good times."}
{"text":"The food at House of Blues is good, but nothing to write home about. I especially like the cajun dishes though. We went during happy hour so the drinks were by far the cheapest of our weekend in Vegas. After the meal we went to the venue to see Megadeth. THIS is where HOB really shines. So much better than the Joint in Hard Rock where we saw Muse the night before. Cheaper too. If you buy balcony seats there's a cocktail waitress that comes buy to take drink orders. Emphasis on seats! You can stand if you like but it is awfully nice to sit during a long show, especially during the lull of a set change. Plus, (and I know I'm a wimp for saying so) balcony seating keeps you out of involuntarily being dragged into the pit, which is really helpful when seeing a band like Megadeth. Best priced tickets you'll find in this area."}
{"text":"**VENUE REVIEW ONLY***  As a concert venue, HOB in Mandalay is pretty decent.  It's set up exactly the same as other HOB's, with the pit on the bottom floor surrounded by bar space, and seating upstairs.  I personally like the upstairs seating, because there is nothing worse than being a short person in a pit setting.  I've been here for a Nas show and to see Common and N.E.R.D. and both were outstanding - the artists really had the crowd dancing in the aisles and on the chairs.  Price wise, both concerts were reasonable too.  My only complaints for HOB : 1. It is a non-smoking venue (WHAT??!?!?!  This is freakin Vegas, everywhere should be smoking allowed) and there is no where to duck off too in between sets to get in a drag (unless you go all the way out to the casino floor or are brazen enough to ignore or subvert security and risk getting the boot) 2. the drinks!  friggin ridonculous!  i paid 18 dollars for a 'rita, including tip.  and it was nasty! (how do you %$*& up a margarita is beyond me).  trust me, drink before you go or strap something to your leg (no i don't remember if i went through a metal detector to get in, so do the latter at your own risk) :)"}
{"text":"5 starts for both food and as a concert venue.  We saw Santana here and then came back another day to have breakfast. (Just plain breakfast, not Sunday Gospel Brunch.)   As a concert venue, it feels intimate. There really isn't a bad seat, of course, they aren't many actually seats. You stand here or you paid a lot of money for one of the few tables. But by being mostly standing room only, it makes you more involved. You are moving. You are dancing. This is good.   The food is great. Eggs benedict here. And the chicken caesar salad I had right before the concert at the bar was much better than I expect from the bar food section."}
{"text":"I've seen three shows here and one gospel brunch. It's a great venue. Seems like there isn't a bad seat in the house. I like the balcony, short drink lines and restroom lines every time I've been there.  Gospel brunch was awful. Very loud, very Jesusy, and the food was terrible compared to the food in the restaurant. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I only went because we had free tickets, but I think we still overpaid."}
{"text":"would not do again. Was sooooo disappointed in the food!!! I also expected a complementary mimosa or bloody Mary..but alas it was serve yourself at the bar OJ and tepid coffee. There was no table service..but they wanted you to tip...I don't get it."}
{"text":"After 10pm there are not many dining choices, so we went for a late dinner after a show.  There was a band playing, so it was extremely noisy (of course).  The food and service are just ok - typical bar food.  But, the people watching was quite entertaining!"}
{"text":"Very cool venue for concerts.  We saw Billy Idol here and enjoyed every bit of the concert.  Billy can still rock, even at 60.  First time at the House of Blues and I honestly could say one of the coolest small venues for concerts."}
{"text":"My experience at the house of blues was less than great to say the least. It was a Saturday night so the hour wait wasn't a problem, what was a problem was that the host wanted either a drivers license or credit card for the table pager. I wasn't comfortable giving either of those items to host at a restaurant for a pager; when I declined both hosts working got rude stating I could wait if I like but if I wasn't there when they called I would lose my table which is understandable. After about 45 minutes we checked in to see if there was an update about our table again the host was rude telling me they had 15 minutes and the exact time that they had to get us a table. When our table was ready they sat us right in front of the live band, which was so loud we couldn't even order or communicate with our server. We asked our server if we could move back slightly which she accommodated with no problem. Our server was amazing and I would enjoy her serving me anytime.   Now lets talk about the food.... Lets start with the chicken I was served... First I'm not sure it was even chicken because the size of the leg and breast I got were so tiny.... When I cut into it and got passed the skin I'm pretty sure the chicken wasn't cooked... It may have been the poor lighting but the chicken just didn't look right.... My moms chicken wasn't much better than mine, but she was able to eat hers... The server offered to remake my chicken but I was already too turned off to try another attempt at it, so instead I ate a side of mashed potatoes. Everything else that came from the kitchen was ok and just ok.... Nothing stood out as amazing or spectacular...  Oh and if there is a band playing they also charge an entertainment fee... Which is a bit unreasonable since the band made it so you had to scream across the table.   So if your looking to be treated rudely,pay for overpriced cafeteria food, and not be able to communicate with your group then this is your place...."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese is GREAT. If you like M & C at all... just trust me and try it."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this House of Blues location. Reservations on a Saturday night for a party of 6 were hassle free, and the live band was phenomenal. The atmosphere is lively, service is friendly, albeit very slow, and the menu is diverse enough to satisfy any palate.   The restaurant is loud and lively with the band, the random people dancing in between tables, and the merry diners getting sustenance to get them through a night in the casinos or clubs.   I like that the have an extensive selection of entrees on the menu. Everything from salad to pasta to tacos, burgers, sandwiches and even meat and potato dishes. We shared a spinach dip appetizer for the table and it was on point. The entrees were very typical of the quality of chain restaurants, and everything was edible. Not exceedingly delicious or memorable, but edible.  It's certainly one of the most fun, fairly priced and easy restaurants to eat at in Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"FIVE STAR REVIEW ALL AROUND FOR CROSSROADS AT HOUSE OF BLUES!  We were at the Mandalay Bay - in Las Vegas for VIP treatment!  Hats off to Brian Kline, Director of Vendor Operations Manager for House of Blues, which Crossroads is part of! Brian made our weekend spectacular for a weekend of good food - and Santana!  WOW!  Went with my husband David, and son Brian ...and from Brian Kline to  the Supervisor, Melody Patron who made us feel we were royalty, and to our servers, Blade at Crossroads who was courteous, gave us great insight on the menu.  From the scrumptious Voodoo Shrimp and corn bread to the mouth-watering bourbon pudding....our taste buds were soaring!  And our wonderful and kind Chris Jones who was our server liaison at the House of Blues...terrific!  The music, the ambience, the food and the great Santana LIVE show...HEAVEN!!! We never want to leave! Thanks you Brian, Melody, Blade and Chris for giving us a weekend that WE SHALL NEVER FORGET! We will be back! Jeri, David and Brian! If we could have given this a 10 STAR ....we would have!"}
{"text":"Great Louisiana style atmosphere! Breakfast was excellent! Would go back again to try their lunch/dinner menu! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to HOB Vegas.  What a great venue for watching a concert.  Viewing options included standing directly in front of the stage, lower floor seating around the outer rim of the venue and upper level seating.  I opted for the standing section.  WOW, two feet from the stage and thumping sound all night long.  I was surprised by so many people lighting trees in the house.  Would I see another concert at a HOB, HELL YEAH!!!"}
{"text":"From 10/23/15  We came to The House of Blues for Korn and Suicide Silence. The House of Blues is located at Mandalay Bay, and not hard to find once you are in the casino. We got our tickets the day of the show which resulted in us having to be in the nose-bleed section, totally our bad- haha!  Once we were upstairs, it wasn't too bad, as a matter of fact the view from the 3rd floor was pretty decent. Drinks are reasonably priced, and there is a server walking around taking food plus drink orders.  I had a good experience, and will be coming back for more concerts in the future"}
{"text":"There is a lot to this place with music and brunches. This review is for a normal dining experience. I've been here three times over the past couple of years.  Breakfast: I liked breakfast here, but the service was slow. Take-out lunch: Walk up to the bar and ordered. The food took forever, but the bartenders were cool.  Dine-in Lunch: This knocks the place down from 3-4 stars to 2 stars. I had cajun shrimp salad that was almost unedible. Whatever they used for the dressing, they put it on too heavy. For some reason it was really spicy. I like spicy, but this dressing was basically medium spicy followed with a taste of nasty. I'm sure it would have been much better if it was only lightly coated. The service was again, very slow.  Overall, the food is nothing special. It would be a much better option to walk over to Border Grille, Citizens, Fleur or even Lupo."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here on our way out of town. Chose it out of convenience at we were staying at THE Hotel. Was told wait was 15 minutes or immediate seating at the \"high bar tables only\". We opted for the bar, but at least half the restaurant was empty and the regular tables in the same section were completely empty (the high tables are very uncomfortable for me to sit at because of back problems and also for the husband who is very tall).  The server was very prompt and friendly and brought coffee right away. However, we did wait about 25 minutes for our food.  The food was tasty, but my omelet had a wrong ingredient in it and I was brought toast with no jelly or butter. My husband said the corned beef hash was better at Red, White and Blue (also in MB hotel), and his poached eggs were not really poached at all (not runny but solid).  We were on a time crunch so we didn't have my order corrected and I borrowed jelly from the table next to me.  For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. I will probably try another place next time."}
{"text":"Saw a $5 off coupon for $25 spending. We  come for breakfast.  The breakfast sampler is a good portion. It has everything. Sausage, bacon, eggs, hash browns and two big pieces of pancake. All dbelicious.  The breakfast omelet is done great also. You can choose three items. We had smoke salmon, Italian sausage. Very good combination.  Services are prompt and nice.   Ps. The coupon can be easily found on some tourist information pamphlet"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a pair of tickets to a show that was playing in this venue. I've never been to a House of Blues before so this venue was pretty exciting, it was a restaurant on the front but around the venue there was a back door leading to some stairs and as you walk below you approach a hall. It was really nice, the stage was large and there was a second floor to go up and sit. This place had three bars and they served food as well, we had burger sliders and crocodile bites ( it does taste like chicken). To drink I had few beers and a \"Adios\"... will you believe me that everything else was all smiles, kisses and plenty of good times. :-D  The band was intense we had loads of fun and the people here were wild.. funny wild if you ask me I had such a great time looking forward to another show."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 shows here since moving to Las Vegas in August.  Falling in Reverse in January, Social Distortion in March, and Billy Currington in April.  This venue was perfect for each of them because it's big enough that a lot of people can fit and really enjoy the music but small enough that there's not a bad view anywhere and you can really vibe with the artist.  General admission standing room tickets are usually cheapest and for us they're usually just fine.  You don't really have to arrive that early (no more than an hour) to get a great spot.  For Falling in Reverse, we arrived at the same time the doors opened and stood in about the third row.  For Social Distortion, we arrived about an hour and a half early and stood in the very front. Security here is usually awesome and is able to stop any fights before the get out of hand.  The only problem that I have is that when the doors are supposed to open, people start going through the security line (pretty basic metal detector wave and quick purse check) only to stand in what appears to be another line for the actual doors to open.  This wouldn't at all be a problem except there's a large area but everyone stands in a single, respectful line.  Every time, security comes through and asks everyone to fill in the rest of the space.  This causes people from the back of the line to be able to move up in front of the people already waiting and someone always gets mad and picks a fight.  It doesn't make much sense considering everyone has to file through a relatively small entry way.  Just be prepared for this and move up as much as you can! On most occasions, we grab dinner at the restaurant after and it's always a fun, upbeat experience.  I'm not sure the exact schedule but I believe they have live music Friday and Saturday nights at least."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only.  Easily the worst dining experience I've had in Vegas.  Came for lunch with four other friends.  Waited 30 minutes (yes we should have left), kept being told our table was being set up and then waited longer.  And they asked for a drivers license for some reason? (yes we should have left!)  Our waiter seemed frazzled and rushed the whole time, and it didn't really seem that busy.  We waited over 10 minuted for our drinks (four waters and a Diet Coke).  My cobb salad was actually good sized and tasty but the rest of my party wasn't so lucky.  The street tacos are a joke, a tiny tortilla with one piece of bland chicken.  The mac and cheese was actually tasty, but the sandwiches my friends' got were all meh.  Oh, and the water was gross for some reason?  We had to get lemons to be able to drink it.  The waiter was maybe the worst I've had; never checked on us, no refills and was even openly annoyed when I gave him a hundred dollar bill for my twenty-something dollar check.  Come for a show, but go ANYWHERE else for lunch."}
{"text":"This review is for the buffett at the Sunday Gospel Brunch.  It was awful!  Almost all of the dishes that were supposed to be hot were cold by the time I got back down to my seat.  The brisket was completely charred black on the outside and very dry on the inside.  Salad tasted wilted as did the fruit.  At a cost of over $60 each, I expected it to be a lot better!  Good thing the gospel singers were entertaining!"}
{"text":"Great place to see ashow. I saw Santana here and both the concert and venue were amazing. I was in the standing room only section and it made me feel like i was part of the band. Amazing experience."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CONCERT VENUE ONLY.  So far I have been to HOB twice this year. One was for Hoobastank and the other was for RZA, Wu Tang Clan founder.  First, let me get the negatives out of the way. That way you can end reading this on a more positve note.  NEGATIVES:  Security says you cant smoke and that you have to go back outside to do so. This is FALSE. The two times I was there people were smoking weed and regular cigarettes. Not once did I see ANY security or usher walking around telling people to put out their smokes. I for one don't smoke but I am not about to be a killjoy by ratting them out. I assumed even if I did, they probably wouldnt do a damn thing about it.   The main floor that's right in front of the stage can get a little messy. What I mean by that is you got people drinking and spilling their beer not just on the floor, but also on other people as well. You will also see pretty much the same people that drink just throw their garbage on to the floor. Talk about litter bugs! Again I for one dont drink but if I did, I would hang out by the bar area to enjoy my suds until I was done. Then I would make my way to the main floor. There should be a rule that you cant drink on the main floor.   The climate to this place fluctuates. Sometimes its rather warm and sometimes it can get pretty cold. Dont know how HOB has their system set up, but its definitely not consistent.  POSITIVES:  The stage has just the right amount of room and is elevated so you can see the performers pretty clear. Since its an intimate setting, you are pretty close to all those that are on stage. Most of my pictures I have taken looks like im pretty much right in front of them so when my friends see the pics, they get kinda jealous because it looks like im so very close to the stage.  The sound and lighting is awesome! When there are some deep bass lines in some songs, you can literally feel the bass pounding right through your body!    So overall, I would say I had an ok experience both times here. Its just that those negatives were still there and it didnt matter who was performing."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks. I ordered a Bloody Mary and my friend ordered Grey Goose and tonic. Drinks were STRONG. I really liked the interior and our bar tender was super friendly. Drinks were not expensive. I would come back and check out the food."}
{"text":"The music was nice, but the cost was ridiculous. Two pastas and a CUP of soup was $81!! We had a $20 entertainment fee attached to our bill on top of the 2 other taxes. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our group accidentally went to the House of Blues during their 2 to 6 happy hour and it was a great, great deal with a couple hits and misses.  The carribean jerk chicken wings are a big hit! The wings themselves are huge since they are both wing and drumsticks. The seasoning on them is delicious and hits that great balance of spicy, savory, and sweet. I got the beef street tacos and those were a major miss. They were tiny, dry and lacking any flavor. The pulled pork sliders were somewhere between the other dishes as they were a bit dry and not as flavorful but were still satisfying.  The best thing about the whole thing was that the total came out to $25 for 4 dishes. A great value in my opinion that filled us up and was good.  It is also good to note that the menu at the Las Vegas location is an abbreviated version of their other locations."}
{"text":"Had the best time here before a show. Food was delicious and came out crazy fast. Club and burger were both great, hot tasty food. Drinks were quick and our waitress was friendly and accommodating by moving us to be closer to the show. Having dinner here is worth pass the line to get easier access to shows as well! Easy to make a reservation, and they consider dietary restrictions when reserving and confirming!"}
{"text":"I give the bar/happy hour a 4. The bartenders are super friendly, dranks are cheap ($3 beers) and the food menu is good. The margherita pizza is delicious. Next door, they have a little club. It wasn't very busy that night (I highly doubt it's a happening place), but it's a great place to go if all you want to do is get your dance on.  The restaurant on the other hand is a hot ass mess. 1 star. Me and the fam went for lunch and we were pretty excited because the menu was created by Aaron Sanchez (foodnetwork chef). My mom ordered the fish of the day, my dad got the rib eye, cousin got te lobster Mac and cheese, bf got the Jamaican burger and I got the juicy lucy burger. First off, we waited forever for the food.. But I'll let that slide because there were 5 of us. Second, the food finally came out and my cousins lobster Mac and cheese was sans lobster. And lastly, my mom found a piece of plastic wrapper in her veggies. We called the manager over and told him about the lobster and the plastic. All he said was that  the kitchen was learning a new menu and that he'd send some new veggies and take care of it. Then the waiter gave us the wrong check and my mom never got her side of veggies. But at the end of the day, we got 50% off our bill.   The rib eye was super tender and yummy. The juicy Lucy burger was tasty and a fattie and the bf love his burger. The fish of the day was swordfish, but it was a tiny ass serving, the size of a toddler's palm. The lobster Mac and cheese is also yummy, but make sure they don't forget the lobster.   All in all, I definitely won't be returning to the crossroads restaurant. The food is ok/good but the service is THE WORST. The part that bothers me the most is that no one was apologetic about anything. But I'll probably go to the bar for a cheap beer."}
{"text":"Food was good. Kudos to the kitchen. Service on the other hand- absolutely terrible. We had a large group of 20, and all we got was a rude lady who said she was just helping out, messed up orders, and empty drinks. You would think with the reservation, they would have their stuff together. Will not be coming back. Too bad cause I like HOB."}
{"text":"Great venue for a show. Can get somewhat claustrophobic if it's a sold out. Toward the end of the show, I headed to the 2nd level to get some space. The video monitors could definitely be updated and larger."}
{"text":"We came to the world famous Gospel lunch for Mother's Day. It was very ok. The table seating was a bit squished. The food deserves a 2. It was tasteless and there was no attention to detail. They forgot to put our cream cheese for the lox and cream cheese bagels, for example. They had no gravy by the carvery station and the meat was dry. The fruit/ pastry station was very under-catered.  The mac and cheese, which was next to the scrambled eggs and no where near the omelette station, were cold.   The show itself was ok too. You couldn't really hear the singers all that well. I thought it would be more fun."}
{"text":"Like the size of this place. Been to a ton of shows here. Always good time. Used to go for service night on Sundays. All around a cool place for locals"}
{"text":"Well... came for a late lunch here after a trade show... probably not the best time to experience the place. While the food was not bad, it was far from memorable."}
{"text":"I booked a last minute trip to Vegas when I found a cheap plane ticket and realized my (second) favorite band, Steel Panther, was playing that weekend. As much as I love Steel Panther and not much can ruin one of their kick ass shows...I kinda hated this venue.   The night started off rough when I was forced to remove my belt and check it for $3 (or I had the option to \"bring it back to my car\"...because...yeah right. Everyone cabs in Vegas, and my hotel was a mile and a half away). My belt was studded but the studs were flat and definitely weren't going to hurt anywhere. And yet security didn't confiscate my bracelet with huge spikes, which, according to the sign I saw upon arriving, was prohibited. Dumb.   The actual space inside has a lot of character, but if you like to be in the front row like me, the stage is awkwardly high, (a foot or so above eye level, and I'm 6'0\"), which makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience. Drinks are also outrageously expensive -- even for Vegas. If you want to be tipsy for a show, don't bother trying to do it here. $11 for a shot of their cheapest rail whiskey (and it was an extra small shot glass, too) was just ridiculous. I get that it's a concert venue in Vegas so it's gonna be pricey...but I was shocked.   Of course, Steel Panther always kicks ass. They have so much energy and are so freaking funny. It was my fifth time seeing them (I'd seen them in 3 other states and 4 other venues previously), and I was really sad to see their set cut short. They changed up their set and played all the songs I'd never heard live before, which was super cool, but then they cut their set short! I don't know if that was a House of Blues policy or something, but the show ended pretty early (around 12:30)...and there was no encore! First time I've seen them that they didn't return to do an encore and play Community Property and Party All Day. I was pretty bummed. I could've watched them play for hours more. Also Steel Panther shows always get wild and inappropriate and a little nude, but the House of Blues apparently has stricter limits on what they'll allow compared to other venues.   If a band I love is playing in Vegas and they're only playing here, I suppose I'd return. But it's definitely not my first choice for a venue."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience had a waiter named Anthony was right on top of things great server.. And great food will be back"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Food was great. Service was great. Price was great. I've heard this place is very lively at night as well. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this venue.  The Standing Room Only concept, and when there is empty tables, doesn't make a lot of sense.  Also, in between the bands, the guests had to wait toooooo long. One of the bands took 40 minutes to setup."}
{"text":"We saw Santana on November 4, 2017 at the House of Blues in Las Vegas. It was hands-down the best concert we've ever been to in our lives! He was amazing, the crowd was excited and well behaved. We were probably 40 feet from him at our VIP seating, well worth the price. The food was great and our service was excellent. His special guest, Quinn Sullivan, is an extraordinarily talented young man. I don't generally like seeing the same person frequently, but I would definitely go back very soon to the House of Blues in Las Vegas to see Santana live in concert."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I had a male server that gave us the poorest service I had ever got in my life! By far the worst server I've seen! I'm a server my self and the things he was doing was absolutely ridiculous! Took him longer than 10 mins to greet us ! Starving and having a short time frame to eat and get to a game we decided what we wanted to order before he had stopped to greet us.. Taking the drink order we had told him that we were actually ready to order food as well. Shortly after taking 3 out of 6 of our orders he tells my aunt \" Hold on one second\" , than walks away and grabs utensils for another one of his tables and drops it off a couple tables down. After doing that he returns and continues on taking our order. Who does that? Right in the middle of taking our order? Something that should NOT ever be done. My girlfriend and I weren't too hungry so we ordered a salad and asked for it to come out with everyone else's food. Around 7 mins later he comes and drops off the salad to us without everyone else's food of course. Knowing we were sharing he did not give us another plate or any silverware at all! Just simply dropped off the salad and walked away without saying a word. He wouldn't stop by to check on us at all still we had to stop him to ask for silverware..  The rest of the food took a long time to come out after the salad as well. After the food came out he drops it off and never seen again. With empty cups wanting refills again we had to stop him. Not remembering that I had a mango ice tea he poured regular tea in my cup and I told him it was mango. He leaves and returns with a little cup of syrup in his hand and just pours it into my iced tea. Yes I do know that the flavored iced teas are regular tea mixed with flavored syrup but is it professional for your server to just fill your flavored iced tea with a pitcher of regular than just pour syrup on top in front of you? I would never do that and I don't think any server would ever think of doing so. This is the worst service ever.     My gf loves the buffalo crispy chicken salud they got here so we have it another shot and damn... Service is just not that great at all... Let alone being rude, and not friendly in anyway. The first time was a busy but now I really don't want to spend a dollar here with people that are flat out rude. How can you be a server and be rude?"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the entertainment, Santana.  We were really looking forward to seeing and hearing this legend of music.  He was the reason we came Vegas for a long weekend.  Here's a warning if you are thinking of doing the same... Bring your earplugs!  Although it will change the music a little bit, at least you will save your hearing.  The music was much too loud for this smaller venue.  The House of Blues holds under 2,000 people.  This is something the sound engineers need to keep in mind.  This is not a large arena of 20,000+ like where Santana used to perform.  When the first song started, we looked at each other and said it will be fine.  By the fourth song we were holding our ears and had to run out of there because it hurt.  We didn't even say anything to the older gentleman on the elevator about why we were leaving and he said if you think that's loud, you should hear the band downstairs.  So we have to wonder, why so loud?  It's not enjoyable for anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and our friends wanted to eat someplace where we could sit down and relax after a long day, and long walks, so we decided to check out the blues. It was nice. I was expecting a performance, but there wasn't anything going on when we came in, but oh well, their food was still good. The service was great. This is a nice place to come for dinner to relax, chat and sober up. We wouldn't mind coming back here again. I gave it a 4 because it was a little dark in there... I get it, its the theme, but still... I'd like a little more light."}
{"text":"Went to House Blues twice in 2 days. The service is pretty bad.  Dinner on 6/7 we were a party of 12. They acted like they were doing us a favor! Service was terrible! We waited 1 hour for dinner. When I inquired about our food, I was rudely told about the number of people was difficult to accommodate. Give me a break. Any professional restaurant and staff will easily handle double the size of our small party. They had the nerve to add the tip, however referred to it as a service charge. music was unbearably loud.   We returned next morning with bounce back coupons. Manager was a jackass. The servers and hostesses told us he was a control freak, and would not accept more than one coupon per table, never mind we spent $370.00 the night before. We split up our party so we can buy one get one free. Our server took both coupons at our table. He got a big tip!  I spend a lot of time in Vegas, at Mandalay Bay where this Restaurant is located . I won't be going back.   I do not recommend this Restaraunt"}
{"text":"I've been here before, but never for their happy hour.  Came here prior to a night of clubbing at Vanity.  The happy hour wasn't huge or anything , but what I did order was super tasty!  Ordered:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip-  Man this was a huge order of chips and dip.  Red chips and white chips ...oh my !!   I love this stuff... one of the best I have tasted.  Buffalo Wings-  $5.00 for a pound of wings... Score !!!  Don't forget the ranch, napkins, extra napkins, and a wedge of lemon to help cleanse your hands of the buffalo scent.  The power of citrus ...amazing !!  Blue Skittles Shot-  This was not on the happy hour, but it was recommended by my server.  It really did taste like a Skittle!  I wonder if there are other shots that taste like the rest of the rainbow?   He let me keep the shot glass too!  Heck yeah !!  I recommend this place for cheap Happy Hour on the strip.  Great value!  Free shot glass, good recommendation from the server, cheap happy hour, awesome Spinaach Dip and Wings... how can I not give them a 5?"}
{"text":"Every HOB is the same, right?  Not true.  Instead of the standing room everywhere downstairs deal that I'm used to, these guys have added a few \"VIP\" areas where one could sit down and/or get bottle service.  Man, this VIP/bottle game has gotten toooo ubiquitous here in the City of Sin.    So we were here to see Steel Panther on a Fri night.  Not too bad a line and I coughed up for the first round of drinks while the others found us a place from which to watch the show.  Just below us are totally unoccupied comfy couches guarded by a helpful gentleman who said that for $300 we could sit and get a bottle of hooch and mixers.  Nay say I, besides, we're drinking beer.  Roll up the sleeves, here come the negotiations...  Long story short (too late) we got down to $150 and it comes with a $100 bar tab.  Still we walked on the deal--two of our members were not drinking by that point.  Anyhow, decent show (though long on the banter and mucho sampled backgrounds) and a decent sound in the venue, but I have one more complaint.  While I was...um...making room for another beer I noticed that Fridays were $6 24oz Bud Lights.  Since I had been paying $11 for 24oz Coors Lt I decided to switch.  Ordered up 3 and was told that it would be $33.  I reminded the tarbender of the ad in the bathroom and he said that was the 12oz cans.  Aw, fuggetaboutit."}
{"text":"I've always walked by and finally decided to try it out. First things first, the drink selection is not that great. I ordered the strawberry smash and my friend got a vodka soda with grapefruit and lemon. They brought us out two identical looking drinks, both with strawberries and one with lemons. I am 99% sure they put the lemons in the wrong one and have her my drink. We had to switch. The food selection was average, not too many \"lunch\" meals if you weren't looking to spend over $20.  We all got the street tacos with house salad. The salad was amazing, but the tacos were bland. Not in any rush to go eat here again.  But hey they gave us free show tickets and the presentation was nice."}
{"text":"What can I say about the HOB. It's alright. It's across from a parking garage, which is convenient, if you can't find street parking. It's got a lot of cool art work scattered about. Dark lighting that sets the mood. Drinks are crazy expensive. I usually pregame or make bae buy my drinks. I don't like that they have ladies in the bathroom handing you paper towels when you are done washing your hands (if you wash your hands) I always tip, but it gets expensive because I am always peeing. If you don't tip they get sassy with you. When it comes to bands playing, the sound usually sounds good. Light show isn't gonna  put you in a seizure.  When they over sell a show it sucks to move around. I just saw Against Me there for the hundred time and it had the perfect crowd. Not too over crowded. Usually when I see Flogging Molly here you can barley move, and it ruins the show.  If you're reading this and going to the house of blue, one word of advice PREGAME! Booze is expensive as hell."}
{"text":"Saw Hanson on October 25, 2017. Definitely go with a VIP table! The table cost $75 a person. Goes and a group of two or a group of four. So it will range from $150-$300 depending on how many people are in your party. That is not bad to have a spot at a very packed concert. Not only do you get a table but the best part is if you are a couple of two you paid $150 but you get a food and drink credit of $150 and if you are a group of four he paid $300 and you get a food and drink credit of $300. Definitely would recommend it because the price of the drinks and if you want to eat would equal that. Go VIP all the way!"}
{"text":"Good food and good music is a winner any night. They bring in some great bands and keep the resturant on top par with most strip favs"}
{"text":"Aaron and Kenny are great at the bar and our server Leah was fantastic. Would recommend anyone that comes to Cleveland to visit."}
{"text":"Hit up House of Blues for Lunch, while in Vegas...Ambeince  great, service was good, restaurant was actually fairly busy for a Monday afternoon.  Food was just ok, not great.  We got the Shrimp Po Boy, Gumbo, Blue Burger, Blackened chicken Sandwich and Kids Mac. Decent portions, just not a lot of flavor... but lets face it theres better eats in vegas and your not stoping here for the culinary excellence, its the music, drinks and location!  Have fun play hard its vegas baby!!"}
{"text":"So Apparently, we never got the memo about the kick ass Harry Potter theme that we underdressed for, as we casually rolled in for what we thought was going to be a typical Vegas strip lunch experience... But my girlfriend and I were blown away by the energy and vibe that HOB was putting out that day!! As a previous service industry major, with a minor in crazy OCD anal retentiveness employee myself, I usually am often let down by the servers and bartenders I encounter in this transient town.... but, on this day, the clouds parted, the universe aligned,  and my friend and I were introduced to Daaaaavid!!! He was fantastic from the time we sat down until we finally had to leave! Charismatic, witty, helpful, funny and most importantly HAPPY to be there!!! He was all decked out in Harry Potter attire, but didn't over do it by trying to BE Harry Potter... our food was perfect, the atmosphere was fun and inviting, we had great conversation with meaning, depth, laughter and positivity! I'd just like to say to the management, that this guy needs a promotion! Definitely recognition for being a model server- he's an asset to any place he goes... my friends totally in love with him I think LOL! I'm glad we decided to have lunch there, although, we had much more than something to eat... we had a kick ass experience!! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here to see Norm MacDonald - funny bastard, degenerate gambler extraordinaire and hopeless alcoholic - not to mention a FUNNY BASTARD.  Drinks were overpriced, but what do you expect.  Best part of the night was when the ghetto fabulous mafia appeared late for the show with their cheap dial-a-dates...even the housewife next to me in the balcony started laughing when they appeared in their plastic Payless pumps and non-flame retardant ensembles.  I guess the old saying, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, doesn't apply to chlamydia - and that's not the name of a stripper at the Spearmint Rhino."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there wasn't any tequila in it. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving only one star because I am extremely disappointed with the service. I arrived with a party of nine and waited an hour and ten minutes JUST for the appetizers. In fact, our appetizers arrived with our dinner orders. Also I ordered a salad and added a meat but my salad arrived without the meat. By the time my grilled salmon arrived, my salad was gone. And the Salmon was salty. The food choices looked delicious but if you're hungry and in a group, you'd be better off going to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with some friends.  I was not impressed at all.  The shrimp appetizer was OK.  The jambalaya was spicy hot (good) but mostly because it was swamped with black pepper (bad).  All I tasted was black pepper.  Service was slow and I never got a refill on my drink or even my water."}
{"text":"Be sure to ask how big the portions are! My wife and I could have split one order and still left food on the plate. Great value for breakfast."}
{"text":"All of my worst concert experiences lie here, except the most recent being manageably okay at the Tyler, The Creator concert. However, after slithering out of the pit and resigning to the side, my group and I settled for the view despite having done pass the line. The reason for the two stars is that nearly ALL my photos were ruined by the huge head of the guard. So disappointing. I understand the reason for him - for safety and whatnot, but you'd think they wouldn't put the biggest guard in the way of at least 20 people's view. Don't bother paying for pass the line unless it's the most mellow show ever, because the GA in this place is like a pit of doom. Don't expect to SEE a good show past the extreme moshing and huge guard heads. Despite the signs they don't pull people out for pushing or smoking weed. If the artist is going somewhere different, AVOID the House of Blues. I know I will make an effort to."}
{"text":"Ate at the restaurant at this hob location for the first time. I work at the house of blues San Diego so it was interesting to get out of my zone and visit another venue. Jessica was our waiter and she was great! She was very sweet and attentive. She gave us everything we needed and more. Drinks were always filled and she was always around if we needed anything. She also let us know that they had pretty good breakfast which we are going to take advantage of tomorrow morning. Thanks Again Jessica!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Ahna. Came in for breakfast last Saturday. Breakfast was fast and I was happy for affordable breakfast"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. Susie Q was the best!  I had the rosemary chicken and potatoes.  Top notch"}
{"text":"I love seeing concerts at the house of blues.  The acoustics are less than perfect but the small venue size and close proximity to the stage makes up for that.  This last visit was for the Pennywise concert on March 16.  Checking in thru security was swift and they were all quite pleasant.  Once inside it was packed which is to be expected with a band like this with such a huge following for the past 25 years.  It was a great time!  The bartenders were efficient despite being slammed.  The one I dealt with took the time to greet me AND thank me after serving me and taking payment.  I know that's trivial but in atmospheres like this those types of qualities general get forgotten about.  One other thing I enjoy about HOB is the security (while ever present especially at this type of concert) are not over-bearing.  They realize that at this type of show it's going to get rowdy, there's going to be a mosh pit, there will be crowd surfing and people will be getting knocked down.  Goes with the territory and that's what I enjoy for this type of show.  Don't worry all of you more timid concert goers...there's plenty of seating upstairs or standing areas around the floor that are out of the mix.  This past experience receives 5 stars from me given the fact that I know going into it that the following will occur:  I will have beer spilled/sprayed on me, my shoes will get trashed, I will be sweaty and I will encounter a few dicks with attitudes...All goes with the territory.  If you want a peaceful experience, go see Celine Dion or something.  Otherwise come to HOB and get rowdy and support bands like this!  Danzig, April 17...see you then!"}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits I've ever had and I had a ginger mint mango drink that blew my mind!!!"}
{"text":"While in the Mandalay Hotel, my associate and I were in the mood for a burger. The House of Blues was our choice; a chain restaurant which has live music halls and are in major markets throughout the United States. The burger was great and so were the fries."}
{"text":"I saw Coheed and Cambria here.  This place lost a star for a miscommunication about their front of the line pass.  They have a $20 pass you can buy to enter the music venue first.  You buy one per person and you go. This pass is good for the store or the back bar.  This seemed like a great idea to my mom and I, as we were planning on drinking first anyway.  We went to the bar and got each of our $20 worth of drinks... and then they say that you can only use one $20 front of line credit per party.  So... what is the point of getting them?  Our bartender went to the ticket booth to make sure that we even needed to buy two of them... turns out we did need to buy one each, but we can't use them?  It all worked out in the end but ugh it was a fiasco.  Absolute fiasco.  The reason that I still gave them the 4 stars is because we did have an amazing bartender, and the venue wasn't overcrowded.  I go to shows and concerts in Los Angeles.  I've seen Coheed and Cambria many times in LA and lets face it, I'm not a spring chicken.  So its getting harder and harder to enjoy the music with all the violence.  In Vegas it wasn't overcrowded and security was on it.  The music was amazing, the show was long, and it was air conditioned!  As for our bartender, after the show we went back for more drinks.  She asked what I wanted and I told her I wanted something fruity but refreshing.  She asked one more question, and that was \"do you like ginger?\" I say yes, and she makes me the most delicious peach/ginger drink i've ever had.  AND she wrote down the recipe so I can have it made again in the future.  Overall, we left happy."}
{"text":"Went for. Real fast. It was cheaper than most spots but it was not very good. The service was really good and the only reason this place got any stars."}
{"text":"House of Blues gave us our dream wedding!   Jen, Mel, Terri, and the rest of the team were total rock stars from start to finish. All along, we knew we wanted to have our wedding in a unique venue downtown. The House of Blues is just that. The Cambridge room is ornately decorated and has a super cool vibe. Jen was so easy to work with. She guided us through the whole process and made sure everything was perfect for our vision. Mel & Terri were invaluable on the day of the wedding. They made sure everyone/everything was taken care of and the bridal party was where they needed to be. They anticipated any and all of our needs and kept this anxiety prone bride completely stress-free.   We loved being able to use the Foundation room before and after the ceremony. It was great to have some time to breathe and celebrate with our bridal party. The food and drinks were just divine! We went with the adobo fried chicken and bbq pulled pork. Our signature drink was a \"Married\" Moscow Mule.   On top of all this, we felt that House of Blues was a great value for our money. It was one of the more reasonably priced venues downtown but absolutely no detail was spared. Overall, I'd recommend the House of Blues to any couple looking for an impeccably unique and totally \"Cleveland\" wedding experience."}
{"text":"I went to the House of Blues for the Sunday Gospel Brunch \"Kirk Franklin Presents\" The food was absolutely outstanding with the unlimited mimosas and bloody mary's. The music was phenomenal. I only gave it 4 stars bc I believe the show was rather short. The choir only did a few songs. But other than that it was an awesome show. I would definitely consider going back next time im in Vegas"}
{"text":"We actually went to because my niece wanted to get a t-shirt from a band that was playing there that night. I want to say Sting?  Anyway, we decided to stay for a few drinks before walking back the to the other end of the strip.  Turns out it was Karaoke night with a live band.  The House Band was great!  Most of the singers were pretty good.  It was just the drunk older women that didn't sound as good but they still had pretty high entertainment value.  LOL!  Would I return yes I would and I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I didn't order any food from the bar, this review is for the stage/lights. I like this place because its a small enough venue you can see everything on stage. We had GA tickets and were standing fairly close to the stage, to be honest even standing in the very back right in front of the bar is good enough. The bathrooms were clean and had an attendant handing out paper towels. I recommend the House of Blues for any concert- inexpensive tickets, will call made it easy to pick up tickets, small venue, and good sound system."}
{"text":"This review is for Carlos Santana Performance only.  House of Blues music venue is pretty small setup and  when you get seated  it appears you have a pretty good view of the stage.  We were in row 208 section C seats 4-9.  I was in seat 4 and could easily see the front of the stage.  The name of the concert is Santana for the world famous highly skilled musician Carlos Santana.  What we could see was his entire band and a salt and pepper male singing duo.  What we did not see was Carlos Santana, the person EVERYBODY came to see.  Yes he was there, yes he was playing, but he practically hid in the far left corner of the stage 99.9% of the show.  Hmmm, so maybe House of Blues should instruct Mr Santana that the crowd paying $125 per ticket and more(price of our seats) are there to SEE him, not just hear him.  If I just wanted to listen to him I would have watched Youtube.  There was a camera man shooting live for the television screens but even that didn't focus on Carlos.  What I am typing might sound like bitter grapes, but trust me nobody on the left side of the stage was happy, most people were just as bored as me, yawning and not even looking at the stage or televisions.  Well maybe if we had purchased different seats the concert would be better-wrong! We left early and I checked the view from the center and right viewing areas and Mr Santana was very difficult to see from those vantages as well.  Mr Santana was virtually hiding from his fans way in the back left corner of the stage.  Santana's sets were also way too long.  Interesting upbeat music quickly devolved into boring noise as single songs turned into ten minute long ordeals.  Dude mix it up and keep your audience attentive not imprisoned.  I have seen almost every show in Vegas and the only show worse than this was the Legends of Music Tribute show at the Stratosphere which cost $20 and came with a free buffet !  I would highly recommend NOT seeing Santana unless you are a die hard fan willing to pay a lot of money to only hear him play."}
{"text":"This place was horrible... I ordered the meat loaf and have never tasted anything like it. Could not get past the horrible texture of the meat. Our waitress looked and acted like she was spun out. My wife ordered the fried chicken and it tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in weeks. Will never return."}
{"text":"Rockstar Karaoke is A FRICKIN JOKE!! The D.J. ONLY let's you sing if YOU PAY HIM!! We went with a group of 14 people. All of us ate and drank A LOT! All of us put in for songs. We were there for HOURS and NEVER GOT TO SING A SONG! We spoke to the D.J. and he said if we \"took care of him\" we could sing. We told him we spent a lot of money on food and drinks and shouldn't have to pay him. He  LITERALLY said \"Too Fucking Bad!!\"  He is a COMPLETE ASS who should be FIRED!!  We will NEVER, EVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN....EVER! DO NOT GO THERE!! There are so many other LEGIT places to go in Vegas, where you don't have to \"take care of the ass\" to sing a song after sitting there for hours and hours!!  SHAME ON YOU HOB for hiring such a SLEEZE!!"}
{"text":"The food well spiced and tasty. The menu is diverse and the portions are generous...too generous! I must say Aune is the best server we have ever experienced in Vegas. Bright, happy, on her game and glad to be working with her clients...make sure you ask for her when you visit.   The biscuits and gravy rock!"}
{"text":"Went to the House of Blues Kirk Franklin Sunday Brunch in celebration of my God-Sister Birthday. **Great Seating, Great Food and of course the Performers(singers) were awesome and a Blessing. We got so involved with participating in singing along and praising God. But only a little disappointed 1. We actually thought Kirk Franklin was going o be there to perform(he was only there video wise) 2. The Food was Great but after the performance it was time to leave, we were like \"What\" that's it!!!Performance is over & Brunch too, WOW!!! but We stood up, sang, & Praise we didn't really eat our food just nibble here and there. Suggestion: A. It should state on your ticket that Kirk Franklin will not be there personally just by pre-recorded Video. B. If Brunch starts @ 10:00 they should give people to enjoy the brunch till 11:00 from 11:00-12:30 performance, 12:30 continue your Brunch till 1:00= change the time frame of the Brunch,. so those that are thinking about going please be on time to enjoyed your Brunch, Unlike us we were enjoying the Praising and singing . It was all Good we left there not full of good food but Full of the Spirit God is Good.... When I visit Las Vegas I will re-visit the House of Blues Sunday Brunch :-)"}
{"text":"Server was engaging and friendly but overall, we won't be back. It was somewhat busy when we arrived around 10:30 on a Saturday morning. 35 minutes to be seated. Ordered beverages and food within 10 minutes.  Almost an hour later, literally 50 minutes, we finally received our pancakes, watery eggs, overlooked bacon and undercooked hashbrowns. Not worth the price and definitely NOT worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here and was surprised because food and service was great.  There Bloody Mary's are the best! I had to order 2.     Mia"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner before leaving for the airport.  I ordered the fish sandwich, which I thought was very tasty...i got sweet potato fries with my meal and I really enjoyed them. However, I do need to complain about the service.  It took so long for our food to come and also for us to get our bill...not sure why because it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I gave this place 1 star because it's the lowest I could rate.  I wish I could give it a negative number.  The house of blues for music and entertainment is great.  No issues there, but the food and staff is another thing.  Single worst dining experience in my life.  Horrible food and just plain rude wait staff.  If you come for a show enjoy your night but look elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to the House of Blues. Everything from the food to the ambience was perfect! We ordered a variety of menu items so we could dine family-style between 6 people. I'm not an expert in cajun-style cuisine but everything I tried, I really loved.   We had: voodoo shrimp, gumbo, jambalaya, blackened jumbo shrimp with fettucini alfredo, and baby back ribs! OH EM GEE, the ribs were spectacular! Tender, moist, and oh so delicious! I was completely addicted to the shrimp fettucini dish. It was served over a bed of alfredo and spicy tomato sauce. YUM! I also got to sample some desserts as well. My faves were the bread pudding and the apple tart. And by the way, the portions are HUGE so be sure to be hungry!  Service is great here...the servers are friendly, efficient, and very good at what they do. The atmosphere was upbeat and fun, with a live band 30 feet away from our table. Can't wait to return to the House of Blues!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice yet comfortable. The beer, local IPA, was delicious and the  Jambalaya was delicious. But what made all the difference, was our server Joseph. He was friendly, knowledgeable and came back around at the right time and in the right amount of time. Music was fun."}
{"text":"Great location, great music.  Watched blackberry smoke perform on 3.19.15 and the sound and venue was great. Security was good at checking for weapons coming in which I liked and they were good at not messing with people who were recording the show with cell phones or just having a good time. Crowd was respectful,  staff was nice and enjoyed the vibe, will come back to watch more music here"}
{"text":"Our server Michael was very helpful on helping us make our selection.. Myself and my hubby shared the appetizer voodoo shrimp so good! Also for entree we shared Cajun blackened chicken pasta to die for delicious and side Caesar salad.. everything here was really good been here many times and have never ate here absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. The French Dip was cold & they forgot the onions, which was probably for the best. Fries were luke warm & by the time I got to eat them, they were also cold. The house of blues salad was good & the horseradish sauce.  Service was tolerable, no personality & a bit pushy.  This was on a game night, so the place being packed & noisy, loud is understandable, but the terrible food & bland service is not. The food is not worth the price at all.  We also tried to use 10% off thru yelp check in & the server had no clue what to do...training session.  I will definitely not be back. I'd rather pack a brown bag lunch then eat this tripe.  The name sells this place, nothing else."}
{"text":"Awesome venue..clean bathrooms..but I do hate feeling obligated to tip every time I need to use the restroom. The bar was very accessible and had quick service. There was plenty of space even though there was a large crowd. In between sets we were able to head over to a connecting Bar/Restaurant \" Crossroads\" which had a local singer performing who was really good. Wish we had a House of Blues here in Rochester."}
{"text":"I just love going to the House of Blues. I'm from California and used to go to all sorts of concerts in different locations but this one is by far my new favorite location. This was my first time getting to see Walk off The Earth, and wasn't expecting to be blown away by their showmanship. having seen some / if not all or their videos on YouTube . I knew they were good but wasn't expecting the show to be amazing. Seriously I had so much fun it was the best show I seen in a long while.  Picking my tickets up at will call around 6:15 pm it was super quick and easy, there was literally no line  and  security was just as fast.  When I actually got into the venue I was shocked to see that the house was practically full.  Doors opened at 6 pm and the opening act ( the Darenots)   started at 7 pm.  They Played several songs including a reggae song. Being from Toronto Canada they expressed how excited they were to be on tour and in Las Vegas. In between their performance and Walk Off The Earth I decided to buy a drink at the bar. Sitting almost in front of the bar it wasn't that hard to make my way there and considering it was between sets the bar wasn't completely slammed. So getting my drink was quick. I got a Pabst beer on tap with a few orange slices for $10 the price was fair and the beer was cold just the way I like it.   At 8 pm When Walk Off The Earth took the stage I was genuinely excited & taken back by how the crowd erupted with cheers. Having found a place to sit I was sitting off to the right of the stage i had an amazing birds eye view. In short this concert was the best one I been to in a long time. Walk Off The Earth has a way of getting the crowd hyped and keep the energy going. They have a unique way of using unorthodox objects to create beats. I found their take on major hits such as Ed Sheeran Shape of You  to be amazing, and almost laughable on how they pulled off the beats. I can't express how much fun this concert was and the best part this band decided to donate 10% of the proceeds they make on their souvenir table would go to opportunity village. Simply amazing I didn't buy anything but I dropped twenty in box for charity."}
{"text":"It was bitter cold out - -1 with a windchill and I forgot my mittens, so we were just glad to be inside.    Once in, we came to a realization that we must've been the only non-Pittsburgh fan that were dining at the House of Blues (HoB) tonight.  The place was quite lively - more than what I expected of downtown Cleveland on a weeknight.    The service was decent and prices reasonable.  The food was a typical chain-restaurant type food (think breaded fish and chips, baby back ribs, burgers, nachos, and the likes).  The overall feel? Just another chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here to eat, but I ate here anyway to get the Front of the Line Pass you can get to enter the music venue earlier than everybody else. At other House of Blues locations, you can buy merchandise to get the pass, but here you have to order at least one entree. My meal was so forgettable, but the service was great all around.  The venue seems bigger to me than other HOBs because they've got a balcony with at least four or five rows of theater style chairs. The floor area is about as big as other HOBs. What made my experience at this HOB better than any of the other HOB locations was the staff there. They were so helpful with asking any questions and the security staff was the nicest I've ever encountered. Really cool security dude helped me get the lead singer's guitar pick. :) I'd give this five stars if they dropped the no-cameras policy."}
{"text":"Made me sick...Literally.  So my husband and I were in Vegas for his birthday and just wanted to catch lunch. So we headed into HOB inside Mandalay Bay because we saw they had Happy Hour from like 2-6.   About 30 minutes after I ate (I had the fried chicken and only ate 2 small pieces because of how drenched in oil it was) my stomach was in knots. I was sick for 2 days!!! Which basically ruined our trip. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the menu or food - pricey for what you get ... starting out artist playing music was ok - will not return here"}
{"text":"Oh, the House of Blues. This is one of those places you want to love really bad but it just doesn't hit the mark. I'm not going to lie, it has a lot going for it initially - the decor is fantastic, it's a more intimate setting so you can get up nice and close to the band, and it's relatively easy to get to. Plus, who can deny that you feel something special when you tell people that you are going to see a concert at the House of Blues. It's a false nostalgia that, while completely unfounded for most of us, resonates of the great music scenes of days past.  I recently went to see Tenacious D here and despite my overwhelming excitement for the show, the venue had some major flaws (although the band was fabulous!).   The biggest flaw is the layout of the venue. It seems to be set up as a bar first and a concert venue second - which may be ideal for people who go here only to drink (no one) and not quite as ideal for everyone else. The general admission area is surprisingly small, and not in a good way. I usually love the small, up-close venues, but this feels more cramped than intimate. In fact, unless you arrive at least an hour early (which I was), expect to be all the way at the back, where the bar stools, balcony pillars, and everything else is in the way. And if you are lucky enough to be at the front like I was, expect to be violently shoved and dry-humped the entire show (even in acoustic jam sessions like Tenacious D was). I was tossed around less at Slipknot and GWAR concerts in other small venues than I was here.   The most unsuccessful part of the layout is that the floor doesn't slope at all (as better general admission venues often do) so if you are under 6 feet tall you will possibly be staring at a big dude's back-rolls the entire show regardless of how early you got there. If I were a short female, I wouldn't ever attempt to attend a show here unless you snagged balcony seats right against the rail because you won't see anything. I'm not a girl and I'm not short, yet I was able to get a clear shot of about 15% of the show and had to stand in sumo wrestling pose the entire time to avoid being pushed onto my face by dill-weeds who were trying to get a better view by shoving.  I'd say it's pretty obvious that the House of Blues didn't give much thought to finding a location that served a concert-goer's needs. There are a ton of great shows that play here and I guess it still beats a stadium concert but I sure wish they had thought about setting this place up better for actually watching a concert."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits was DELICIOUS. It was amazing. I will definitely order this dish whenever I get to HOB again. I ordered take-out so I can't evaluate the service."}
{"text":"after about an hour of arguing what to eat, my friend and i reluctantly decided on h.o.b.  much to our surprise it was pretty good. got the blackened chicken sangwich with sweet potato fries.   hit the spot big time. now where is my straw......."}
{"text":"Hey!!  I'm waving my at you!  Yes, I'm up on the stage at the House of Blues Gospel Brunch, and I've got my big blue hat in my hand, and my Sunday print dress on, and I'm waving at my pals to come on up and join me!!! Which they eventually do, after slurping down the last of their Bloody Mary's.  The music just enters your brain and gets your spirit hopping, and before you know it you're up on your feet on stage, even if it isn't your birthday or anniversary, it can be one of the best times of your life. The buffet is a generous and overwhelming helping of Southern food, so there are a lot of Southern favorites like ham, peel and eat shrimp, corn bread, and even grits, as well as coconut cake and all the regular breakfast staples.  The meal is served at long tables, like a dining hall, then the band comes on and renders their soulful ballads in the best of gospel style.  There is an invitation for interaction with the band, the servers constantly bring drinks around, and if you are able to recover from tehenight before, go on up stage and sing halleluliah like you mean it!"}
{"text":"It was meh. Over priced and very small portions. Said live music and we went on s Friday night and it was very quiet. The food was ok in flavor nothing spectacular. I think this is one of the tourist trap places."}
{"text":"Pretty Impressive Dining Experience!  Besides a gorgeous ambiance; aslo the food quality was GREAT.  When I was walking in Mandalay Bay, \"House of Blues\" caught my attention with a unique design and decoration. I wanted to try this restaurant but the reviews made me doubt; after a little bit hesitation, we walked-in and I am glad that we did it.  As we seated, we ordered some refreshing drinks, I ordered white sangria which was sweet and yummy. From the main course, I ordered a veggie dish \"Grilled Vegetable Bouquet\" and requested to add shrimps. All the vegetables grilled perfectly and spiced just right, and shrimps grilled really good. The combination of all was great. My friends also liked their foods a lot. Unexpectedly foods and drinks were impressive.  Our server had a little attitude in the beginning; but when we started complimenting about our foods, she became friendly and nice.  Overall, we had a nice dining experience in this unique design restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I think it really depends on what you order, but I enjoyed my shrimp and grits a lot, and so did my coworker who ordered the exactly same thing! Most of the menu was a bit on the meaty side, and if you feel like seafood or vegetarian, it might not be the right place for your meal. However, their shrimp and grits were pretty flavorful with plump, big shrimps that would certainly satisfy your hunger, just a bit on the salty side though but we got water.  I heard their meatloaf and burgers were delicious too, but I haven't tried it so far.  Service was friendly and prompt. The atmosphere was pretty nice with all the wall decor. It's also very easy to find, almost in the center of the casino, which can hardly be missed.  Overall, a great place to have dinner, especially for big groups, because there should be something for everyone's taste."}
{"text":"The food was great, but this review is about excellent service. It started with our server, Ashley R.  She had us laughing the entire time, while providing perfect service. Her recommendations were on point. She invited us back for breakfast and gave us some coupons to sweeten the deal. That's where the second part of my story begins. I put the coupons in my wallet but forgot my credit card. Didn't realize it was gone until after midnight when we were leaving the casino. The restaurant was closed but Melody, the manager, checked everywhere, texted Ashley, and together they figured out where it was. Above and beyond!"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of attending a concert here last week (K Michelle) and it was amazing! I have been to plenty concerts here before but never did the whole VIP experience kind of thing. As I've gotten older I'm really no longer a fan of \"standing only\" concerts at these kind of venues! Now that I have the kinda coins to splurge and sit up top at a table I opt for that! Nothing like great bottle service while you are watching your favorite artist right? The sound is great throughout the venue, and I have no complaints on anything else. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this earlier on! The food options of course are priced higher than usual but that's a given! Once you get a few drinks in you and rock out to whatever you're listening to that price tag no longer becomes of any importance!"}
{"text":"The dessert was delicious - the bourbon bread pudding and the coconut cream pie - but Phil's music changed our life."}
{"text":"Jessica is Awesome!!!! Best service I've ever had at any restaurant IN MY LIFE! She gave us honest opinions on which dishes to try, perfect descriptions and checked on us frequently. Definitely made me want to visit every House of Blues around the world to see what they're like."}
{"text":"Came here for food and drink. the drinks were potent (especially the sangria) and tasty. I had a shrimp spinach salad and it was VERY good. My sis had the quesadilla and wedge salad, and gave her thumbs up. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Just left the Gospel Brunch. Wonderful! My wife and I loved it. Great fun show and all the food on the large buffet was delicious. That was a surprise. Chicken and Waffles, biscuits and gravy, catfish, bread pudding. All of it. A nice meal and show for the money."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this venue. The staff was wonderful and the drinks downstairs in the concert venue were amazing. The only negative I found was that the sound isn't that great unless you're in the audience in front of the stage. If you want to stand by the bar, behind the sound board, or along the fenced/railing area, the show will not sound it's best. If you can - get down into the crowd and prepare to have a fabulous evening!"}
{"text":"Girls loved the fish tacos and club.  I had the po boy and it was super greasy and tasted more like oil than shrimp.  Really disappointed in the service as well, waitress came by once to get our order.  I've always loved the food and service here so I will be back.  Just disappointed w this visit!"}
{"text":"We have been to this venue three times for concerts and it continues to be a great venue.  This time we treated ourselves to a VIP table and it was AWESOME!  Service was great, the fact we didn't have to stand for the entire concert and had a dedicated view was wonderful. And the office staff that worked with us to make sure our nite was a success and we're so happy with this experience! Would definitely recommend the concerts at the House of Blues!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and sits off to the side in the Manadalay Bay casino.  It has that fake rustic look and lots of tables everywhere with a stage for their acts.   HOB is about the merchandise and not the food.    I have never seen a show here. I ate breakfast here once.  I ordered a $11 ity bity breakfast burrito that was the blandest thing ever!  Plus service was so-so for being so dead.    Their lunch/dinner menu looks good, but after the bad breakfast I probably wouldn't head back."}
{"text":"The venue is very nice. The decor is cute but the drinks were very expensive. I ordered a pbr and a gin and soda and it was about $18. This venue is fine but nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"Saw Billy Idol on the last night of his 2016 residency and he ROCKED! Billy gets 5 stars. This venue only gets 3. My opinion might be different if I had a seat. Unfortunately all reserved seats were sold out before I thought to look for tickets. So, it was standing GA for us. Friend was happy about that as he'd done that before & said it was great. This time around he said it seemed like they added more tables in the typically GA section, drastically reducing the available room. We arrived just before 8 and everything was packed. Sardine packed. We found a place on the side where I could breathe, but really couldn't move/dance much because it was a walkway to the bar. The show was a truly fun blast from the past. Billy still has it. But, HOB would not be a go-to venue for me unless the artist is one I'm dying to see."}
{"text":"Try the flat bread! Basil tomato! Yum"}
{"text":"Really good and easy. Also reasonable continental breakfast.  Great bloody Mary too. Service great and courteous"}
{"text":"This is just a concert venue review. The place is small and very quaint for a place that houses shows and it definitely let's you capture that personal feeling with the artist no matter where you wind up. I don't understand the two big pillars that block a ton of viewing (especially from the bar area). The whole stage center section around the sound boards is blocked off as well for a \"VIP section\" eliminating some pretty good viewing areas but yet no one was in it the whole night.   The balcony area seemed very cool but it was closed for our show even though the bottom floor was jam packed with people which stumped me about the place as well. Acoustics were pretty good and you get a good energy level from the small and close size of the place when the crowd gets into it. The attitude of the personal I dealt with was piss poor and to put a \"camera\" in coat check cost $3.00!? All and all I had a blast but wish the artists selected a better Vegas venue."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience here! The service was incredible... Very attentive and we were well taken care of. We ordered the cornbread, the voodoo shrimp, jumbalaya and lobster mac and cheese. Everything was delicious and extremely rich, which is good for the cold weather. I also ordered a hurricane, but was only able to finish half of it. It was delicious and not too sweet, but very strong (in a good way :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times before, usually for breakfast.  The menu has recently changed, however, I prefer the previous menu.  It was easier to order from.  The service is always good I feel.  They have a nice gift shop.  Eat one breakfast one morning, get 2 for 1 next day with your receipt!"}
{"text":"A fun spot to visit for drinks or a happy hour, but there are much better options for a meal within Mandalay Bay. For a drink, I tried the blood orange, basil and lime margarita and it was fantastic. So good in fact, that I thought about it the next day. For lunch, I ordered the lobster mac and cheese, and left most of it in the little skillet it came in. It was very bland, not very cheesy, and covered in about a pound of breadcrumbs. My lobster pieces actually had gristle attached to them, and I had to spit two of them out. For $22, I wasn't impressed. So, if you are planning a trip to House of Blues, stick with the drinks and enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Yea, yea.. I know it's a chain, but I've always loved our House of Blues in Cleveland.  I can't tell you how much I hate being a number in a huge arena full of people. It just disconnects you from the music. At the HOB in Cleveland, it's a big enough venue for great bands to play at, but small enough to feel uber intimate. Talk about the best of both worlds.   I've never been one to push my way through a sweaty, stinky crowd just to get close to the stage. I'm all about the sound, the connection, not the \"star\" factor of being close to the performer. What I love about HOB is that you can sit up on the balcony and still be super close to the show. It's a better view up there with better sound and I can sit down when I want. I mean, that's insanely better than being pressed up against some hot, sticky stranger who's probably going to start a mosh like a total jack-ass.   The balcony level also has bathrooms, two bars and a cocktail waitress for your excessive drinking pleasure. I mean, it's pretty much guaranteed that if you're boozing during a show you're going to have to get up to pee at least a few times. Lucky for you there's easy access to beers and the potty.  Speaking of the bathrooms, like other yelpers have mentioned I too have an issue with the attendants. I appreciate that it's always super clean in there. But,  if I'm not making eye-contact with you and reaching for my own paper towel, please don't come at me saying, \"Here you go, ma'am... no, look here, I have a towel for you.\" It makes me feel uncomfortable that I have no cash on me to tip you with. I don't want you working for free and I'm more than capable of grabbing my own towel, thank you.   Also, be prepared for the on-slot of teenagers who fill the seats for shows. You cannot escape them or the parents they've dragged with them. Sometimes I just want to buy these folks a shot for having to suffer through a concert with 10 teens.   Other than that, go enjoy a show and grab some dinner before hand if you're running behind. There are lots of great restaurants up and down E4th to suit any palette."}
{"text":"Service here is always exceptional! Love the food and decor. I make sure to come here everything I stay at Mandalay Bay. A must try appetizer is the Jalapeño Pepper Cornbread with maple butter. I ordered the Island Turkey a Burger, which was amazing!"}
{"text":"House of Blues is one of my favorites, I have gone to many awesome shows but never been to the one in Vegas. The Flatbread is amazing and Tracy, our waitress is fantastic! My wife and I sat here hot over two hours and had the most amazing time, Tracy kept us hydrated and was a pleasure all the way. Tracy rocks!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3 stars and only because of the good music and food. The server I had when I went there for a work party was horrible. My whole table asked for a round of waters. We each ordered our own drinks as well.  Got the alcoholic beverages but never received the waters until after the meal was done upon asking the whole time for them. My meal was made perfect however I can't speak for the rest of my coworkers meals. Everyone's food was made wrong and when asked to fix it took twice as long for the server to come back at all with anything at all. When asked for things our server seemed aggravated, Mind u we had to go up to the bartender to ask about our server n what was going on. We were his only table in this section and it wasn't that busy. I mean I would go there again for sure but request a different server. Don't know what his name was. But yea."}
{"text":"The Sunday morning Gospel Brunch is amazing!  All the workers are very friendly and helpful.  The food and beverages were fantastic.  And the singing group made it so much fun!  They are really good.  It was a very fun experience."}
{"text":"About 3 weeks ago my wife and I went to see a rock concert ,the band was Badflowe the singer is our friend son,I have a bad knee and we asked for a place to seat.One of the manager come to talk to us and told to what she can ,10 minutes later she come and took us in and gave us a place to seat, I'm sorry I forgot her name, Great manger great venue, thank you HOB."}
{"text":"So, apparently being ecstatic about Steel Panther isn't enough of a review for this place - so I have to actually rewrite it.   Steel Panther. That's all i have to say. What a great show. I've been here twice to see them, and both times the House of Blues was a great experience. The lines were quick to enter (this last time I went) and the first time during the VIP host, both the front host and our cocktail waitress were pleasant to work with. Great setup and started on time both times. It was a blast and enjoyed my visit here both times.  Thank you Steel Panther. We will see each other again soon! THank you HOB for a great setup!"}
{"text":"The Shrimp and Grits were amazing!!  The mac & cheese was terrific!!  I loved everything except the lemonade.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't show up to a Santana concert thirsty! My one complaint is the outrageous prices for water. As if my $350.00 wasn't enough for the two Santana tickets you feel the need to steal from concert goers  by charging 5.00 for one run of the mill bottle of water. This water did not taste like fresh gear drops from the cherubs in heaven but I feel that's what I paid for. I totally understand drought desert conditions but this is stepping over the line. You drain the canals in the Venetian and drain the water features in front of Treasure Island and the Mirage--that's when I will be willing to see water shortage sucks and we must pay more.   I will not stand for this aggression, house of blues administration.   I can understand the risks involved with serving booze to a crowd that's known for über-indulging in the intoxicating substances, which is why I could assume you charge $11.00 for a small whiskey & 7. Everyone needs a drink of water, I don't fear the liability involved with this necessary business approach.   Oh yeah, the venue itself is awesome. Folky, quirky, bluesy--great seats are to be found just about anywhere. I would warn you that section 208 is quite steep and high above the actual stage in case you need a different perspective.  As for the quality and showmanship of Carlos Santana--his guitar delaying ability remains top notch. His ability to whoo a crowd is suspect. He doesn't move a whole lot around the stage and dont expect much singing from him. Did I feel like I was on the bargain end of seeing one of my guitar heros in person? Not really. Over $300.00 for a couple is a lot of dinero for this part time college student."}
{"text":"This is sad for me to be giving this place 2 stars but here we are. This is a place of memories as I recall coming to shows here in high school and the place being awesome.  However now, I'm simply annoyed at how outrageously cramped this place gets. I get it that it's a concert and should be packed but the venue should allow for some type of elbow room. This shouldn't be a place you pay money to feel like you're in a cattle car or a chicken coop.   Sidenote I experienced an very shitty bartender here. I had to have been standing at the bar top (at the counter) for about 10 minutes while the dude took orders to my left, right, like wtf man? So I finally say to the guy hey can I order a drink or what I've been standing here staring at you, waiting to take my order for quite a while. He has the audacity to tell me it's my job to tell HIM I'd like to order something. Like I'm standing at the bar staring at you for my health? Anybody who's BEEN to a bar before knows it's the other way around. Incredible moron, incredible!  So sadly, unless House of Blues expands their venue a little bit, or limits ticket sales to  a reasonable number, AND rids themselves of self righteous d-bag bartenders I think I'm good on coming back for a while."}
{"text":"I saw Thievery Corporation here during the Vegoose festival over Halloween weekend.  It's a pretty small venue which is nice because you have a close view of the stage from almost anywhere in the place (I always like to see what they're doing), but it also gets really crowded and is almost impossible to move around.  Overall, just okay.  Not bad acoustics.  I like the multi-level set-up.  I would recommend making it to the upper-level on the far side opposite the entrance.  From there you'll have a good view of the stage and crowd, be close to the bar, and have a little bit more breathing room."}
{"text":"we came here for a banquet. it was free. the cornbread was absolutely amazing. too bad there were 10 people sitting at each table and it was cut into 8 pieces. so by the tme the bread went around to the last 3 people, well, you know the rest. note that 10 people do not really fit around those tables, so the whole thing was uncomfortable, to say the least.  food was easily underwhelming. mostly due to a lack of logistical skills, which, like the bread, made the whole evening seem rather awkward. example: pasta was supposed to have some sort of topping. not sure what it was, since they served most of it to the first few tables and the rest of us got some wet noodles. hmmm..."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with the sweet potatoe fries -YUM! The sandwich was off the hook. The pork was tasty and not over sauced on a soft bun. The sweet potatoe fries were sweet and crispy -just the way I like them.   Service was just OK..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. Like any other HOB. The food was pretty good. I had the grilled Mahi sandwich. It was tasty and lightly buttery. It had a nice creole dusting of spices and a traditional tartar sauce. The sauce was not overbearing on flavor and was a delightful dish. The fries were cooked to perfection and lightly salted. I added salt of course because I needed my blood pressure to go up...lol. My friend had the calamari appetizer. It was fried nicely and had a good crunchy texture to it. Came with a nice dipping sauce that had non traditional flavors. All in all it was a great experience. Come on by to eat, chill and listen to some good music and you might even be lucky enough to catch a celebrity or two here. : )"}
{"text":"I can't believe I am saying this....Especially since I am NOT a fan of national chains... But DANG!!!!  Party of 12 for a close friends birthday all met at HOB and smh...BEST NIGHT EVER!!!! From the service to the food to the entertainment, all was executed flawlessly!!! One hiccup that I will ding them on is billing...I got 3 receipts, one said 34 dollars and two said 51 dollars, so me being slightly buzzed was just gonna write the 51dollar and tip but the haze cleared and DID ask the waitress what the two different amounts meant. She said one was a mistake and retallied... Me being an old server from the day thinks a fast one was almost pulled... therefore a 1 star subtraction for the tomfoolery......"}
{"text":"Went here before a concert for dinner the decor was super fun they had a live band playing that was good it was a little loud and hard to hear our conversation and the food was good"}
{"text":"Bro, John the bartender is the motha fucking OG of east 4th. That ginger prince is nothing but a warrior. Asked for 4 shots of bacardi in a drink and that dude made me a hurricane. So blessed. Bless up for John at house of blues. Cute ass. Btdubs, A Aron also can bartend the fuck out of my drinks. He's an OG out here in the streets."}
{"text":"Went here last night  after  along drive from California and a few hours on the casino floor. The server and service was fabulous and fast. Our young girl server was super nice and kept up with everything. The atmosphere was also well designed and comfortable, not loud and quite pleasant. My GF and I shared the Grilled Sword Fish, The fish was cooked improperly. It was so Salt water fishy tasting and rubbery we couldn't  finish. The appetizers saved the night and were outstanding. \"Or server recommended Shrimp over Corn Bread with a reduced sauce, this was to die for and would recommend. Then we ordered the Buffalo wings, these also were nothing to rave about. The sauce was not to tasty, I've had better wings from Costco out of a bag and cooked in an oven. My son had the Fish Taco's, he ate them so I'm assuming they were ok, he's not much for opinions. His GF had a Bacon wrapped meatloaf. She had all of us try her selection as she was cracking up on the taste. We all came to the same conclusion that the Meatloaf tasted like a \"Slim Jim\" Jerky. I'm guessing we are not going back soon and will try another restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"We came to watch the live music and decided to eat while we were here. Not real impressed with the menu choices. I felt it was quite pricey but I guess it was worth it to sit down and listen to the music. I had the side order of mac and cheese for about 6 bucks. It came in a skillet and could have been a meal. Hubby had the jambayaya. He said it was quite tasty but not worth the almost $20 he paid for it, for sure. I was pretty shocked when our waiter, an asian guy who called himself 'kitti', brought three lemons on a toothpick and deposited them into the palm of my hand. What the hell am I supposed to do with a hand full of lemons??? Glad we went for the music experience but I wont rush back."}
{"text":"The service was painfully slow. Drinks were watered down and over priced. The food was OK at best. I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"When I went to see Brandon Flowers here (my one and only, hopefully last visit to this HOB) the staff was horrible.  I know this will sound silly and like I'm exaggerating, but I truly felt like none of them had ever organized/worked a concert before.  It was absolute chaos.  I go to concerts all the time and this was by far the worst experience I've had with a venue and their ability to fairly and effectively manage the crowd.  Lots of people were waiting all day long before the show started and hours later, closer to showtime, the whole line was moved around about 8 or 9 times.  One guy would tell us we were all in the wrong place and needed to line up by the escalators, then someone else would lead us to a different spot in the casino, then back in front of the venue again, and it went on and on and on.  This whole time the line was getting messed up and people were running around like crazy trying to make sure they didn't get screwed out of their spot.  Once they finally decided where to put us, half the people were facing in one direction and half in the other direction.  The staff couldn't even decide where the front of the line was!  It was so ridiculous none of us could believe it.    They continued to be completely unorganized and when we were finally let into the venue, they destroyed the line again by holding back the right side & letting tons of people from the left go in...and then did the same to the other side.  Do these people not understand the point of lining up??  It's not just for fun, it's because we all spent many hours trying to ensure a great spot.  Telling us \"every spot is a good spot\" is irrelevant and makes it clear that you don't understand at ALL.    Oh I forgot to mention the best part.  To even get into this line that would be let in first, they force you to spend $20 in their store or restaurant to get a pass in.  So if you're a huge fan of whoever is playing, just know that the 'Pass The Line' people will be let in before you unless you shell out an additional $20.  Way to pray on the fans, make a quick buck, and then treat us like crap, HOB.  Not amused at all.  I hope Brandon never plays here again, because he's the only musician I'd go through this for again.  I almost gave them 2 stars because the bartender was nice when I asked for water, but they really don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Now that I have been to both the music venue as well as their restaurant and other conference/\"back party room\" (for the \"May The 4th Be With You CMYE), I feel as if I have a pretty good grasp on this place... As least enough to write a solid review.  I have to commend this place. Most people associate more gimmicky restaurants like this with poor food and service. NOT HERE! You will be amazed with how on point both are. My guest and I were seated promptly, even though they were semi-busy. Our waitress was there with two glasses of water as she greeted us. I thought that was very smart, because as a former server, 99% of people are gonna want water anyway... Saves you an extra trip.  So she gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and decide what we wanted, and made sure the food came out quickly. She checked on us regularly and chatted for a little bit too. Pretty much the perfect server experience!  The night I was there (a Friday), they have karaoke with a live band. Oh. My. Lawd. It was so fun! I didn't sing, but I wanted to! It looked like a blast. Just watching the people get up and sing was fun. You know how most bars that host karaoke, you kinda zone out, it's not really that cool...... This was the complete opposite! Good times.  I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was very, very good. Super creamy,not too cheesy, light, crispy bread crumbs, with sizable chunks of lobster, all served piping hot. I have a slight lactose/heartburn thing. It is fairly mild, but if I have too much dairy (specifically frozen yogurt. It's the worst) or too much oil, I can get all bubbly in the gullet area. I ate half of the meal then, and the rest later on. No problems at all! That's proof there was a good balance of ingredients. It was pretty expensive ($20), but with all the lobster they loaded it with, I wasn't too surprised.  Moving on to the music venue. I came here to see the band Meshuggah, with Animals As Leaders for the opening band. I have been to many a music venue in my heyday, and let me tell you... House of Blues' venue is one of the really good ones. It's pretty much close to perfection. The way that they built it is that no matter where you are located, you can see the band. It's intimate enough that you feel connected to the performance, but large enough to hold plenty of people. They have two smaller bars and one large one. The large bar is in the back, and had about 3 or 4 bartenders working it at the time, so you never had to wait for a drink. If you did, it was MAYBE two minutes, max. They even had cocktail waitresses, for those hardcore fans who don't want to miss anything by going to the bar!  The drinks are pricey, the they almost always are at these places. The cheapest place I have ever been to for venue drinks was Station 4 in Minneapolis, where you could get a PBR tall boy for around $4. That's as good as it gets. I think my beer at HOB was a full cup o' beer for $7 or $8. I firmly advocate a little pre-game action prior, then anticipate to buy a couple at the show. Everyone wins!! The few times I have ordered a mixed drink here, it has been a little weak, especially for the price you pay for it. I guess that would have to be my only \"whine\" moment about HOB.  This place has it all: good food, great venue, awesome service, and cool decor. It's pretty much a \"must do\" in Vegas if you are gonna be at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Great venue once Inside.   Lines are absurd (hour or so at doors open time) Tonight's show was an hour. ... disappointing for the money spent"}
{"text":"I was excited to try H.O.B. while on vacation, but my breakfast never came so I left and not to mention I waited 15 mins to sit (party of 1) and an hour plus before the waiter walked by and said \"oh gosh idk what's going on\" Booooo!!"}
{"text":"The bf wanted to see Bad Brains in the worst way and much to his surprise they were playing at House of Blues last night. Hooray! According to him this was a rare treat (I guess they were only playing 3 dates in the US).   The tickets were cheap and because we were locals (with local ID) we got the service charge waived and some sort of VIP drink pass which gave us discounted well drinks, house wine and domestic beers. The box office staff were friendly and quite helpful.   On the day of the show there was no line to get in, the bouncers were pleasant (that's kinda rare in Vegas...maybe because I am a girl). There were a bunch of people standing to the side smoking (since I last came here they made everyone go out into the casino to smoke...kinda weird).  We roll up to the bar and they had big boy cans of beer. We wanted PBR but they were out so we opted for Miller Lite. With our cool discount band we got 2 for $12. That isn't horrible by Vegas standards Sam, the bartender, was awesome and sweet. Totally made us feel at home (well as best as he could considering the music was loud and the crowd was rowdy).  Overall we had a blast at the show and I didn't even feel old (I was probably the average). Plus...there were not too many skeezy guys trying to scam on girls...hooray! Will be back if there is another band that we want to see."}
{"text":"I got free tickets through Fillaseat to see the cover band called Saved by the 90s. Although the music this band plays is really not my thing, I had worked some very long hours over the holidays that I just wanted to get out for a little bit.  Husband and I went to the HOB on a Saturday night. My tickets says that the doors will open at 8 pm and that I must pick up my tickets between 7 and 7:30 pm.  Lucky, my husband works for MGM International, so parking at the Mandalay is free for us. Because of the tragedy that occurred in October, the Mandalay parking lot was empty. And because of this, there was a little sadness in my heart. At this point, I need a little something to cheer me up a bit.  My husband and I made our way to HOB. Now, I've been to this HOB for dining, but never to their concert venue. I thought the events team did a really good job with the outdoor setup.  We clearly understood where we needed to go to pick up our tickets. The lady helping us, it was clear that this is just a job for her :|    After picking up our tickets, my husband decided that we should go in right away since they were letting people in.  The \"bouncer\" asked for my ID, which shocked me, because I don't go to \"clubs\" and I'm old so I'm not used to being carded where as my husband wasn't carded and he looks way younger than I do.  We got to the event person that scanned our tickets and then made our way to security. We followed all the rules, take everything out of your pockets, we were quickly scanned, and my purse was checked.  Because we got there early enough, we got through the preliminary stuff rather quickly. And once again, the event people were professional.  Because this was our first time to the concert venue, when we got into the small lobby area, we didn't know where to go. Once we quickly observed our surroundings, we headed downstairs.   As one would expect, when we got into the club, it was dark with bright lights coming from the stage and dim lights around the bar. Because it's been such a long time that I've been to a venue like this, I thought it was small.  And more importantly, where's the seats!? :D And with the few pub tables available, why is it barricaded off!? I see, standing room \"only\" show unless you pay the upgrade. Upgrade was $50 person or $100 bar tab for a table. $100 bar tab for a table isn't bad when you have a bunch of people, but it was just my husband and I. Thanks, but no thanks, we'll stand.  I did go to the bathroom and found it clean. They even have a lady in there with a line of lipsticks, hair sprays, perfumes and paper towels. Classy.  It is a nightclub, so I did expect areas of sticky floors and a bit of sticky counters.  My husband ordered a Stella Artois. I believe the big bottle was $12. My husband also ordered fries, which was actually really good and not too bad at $5.  While waiting for our fries, a DJ and his hype man were on stage. Shortly thereafter, they moved their equipment so that the first band could play. The first band, Garage Band, was alright. In the middle of their set, we finished our fries and made our way down towards the front of the stage and found our place against the stairs.  Once the band was done, the DJ came back out along with his \"MC\" and we partied like it was 1990. And this DJ was a real DJ; he mixed, cut and scratched and played music from the late 80s and early 90s. My husband actually live streamed it on FB and his friends were getting a kick out of it. And to think, it was only 8:30 pm!   The cover band came out, we enjoyed the first 5 songs, the club was getting packed, just a sea of people dancing and having a good time.  My husband wanted to meet the DJ. Turns out the MC is from HI and his wife is the events manager at HOB, also from HI. So, of course, super cool people.  Good venue with big name acts like Santana and Marilyn Manson performing here. Great people. A little pricey, but all-in-all, a really good time.  Wait, you got people from HI working for you and a drink called \"the 9th island\"!? Bumping this up to 4-stars."}
{"text":"The food was great....the venue is AWFUL. Let me preface this by saying I love concerts. I love going to intimate shows but the House of Blues makes me crazy as a concert goer. I cringe when I see one of my favorite bands play there. Sometimes I wont even go because I hate this place so much  1) Sound: Awful. We were at Grace Potter last night. Stood on the left side of stage. The crowd noise was so loud it literally made her sound like background music. Switched to the right side and much better.   2) View: If you are short, you better pay for a seat. Fortunately I am not and I still couldnt see most of the time. Awful sight lines for a concert. The layout is completely terrible. So much wasted space in the middle. The place needs to bulldozed and rebuilt...or move it elsewhere where you can SEE the show  3) Prices: $5 for a Diet Coke!??????????????? Are you kidding me? What. A. Joke.  Go to Beachland Ballroom. Sound is great and you can actually see the show."}
{"text":"We had our customer appreciation party here for SEMA. It was a great venue for it. well  laid out with a dance floor and stage. We had the blues brothers tribute band played for the group they we off the hook! When they finished we gave all our dealers blues brother sun glasses and took pictures with them too. HOB put out some good food too from fresh sliced meats and mac n cheese to cold cuts, chips and salsa and pizza and we had an open bar!! it was a great time. They had to chase us out. we must have done something right"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was like a concert with food. I'm not sure if the music varies from one week to another. But the gospel band that played, did a lot of preaching. More than I've experienced in Glide Church (my favorite gospel venue in San Francisco.)   The band was fine, but the set was very short!! One of the singers seemed to spend an awful lot of time introducing his family, his friends, any married people in the audience, any birthday people in the audience, and basically jabbering instead of cranking out the good gospel music.  The food was plentiful, as any buffet is, but nothing stood out, and a few things just didn't taste good. The carving station had ham...or ham. The salad bar didn't have anything beyond standard salad stuff. The deserts were ok. The shrimp were fine. The biscuits and gravy were fine. The chicken was yummy. And everything else was utterly forgettable.  Also, maybe drink prices went up, but I got a diet Coke, a bloody mary and a club soda, and it was $12.50.   I love gospel music, but prefer mine without the preaching -- esp in a secular venue.  I wanted to go. I went. I wouldn't go back again.  It wasn't awful. But there wasn't anything great about it either."}
{"text":"House of Blues is like the Hot Topic of venues for catching a punk show. I've been to one in Orlando for a Bad Brains reunion W/ HR singing. I've caught a couple of shows here in the Vegas location. The last one was Rancid. They make you check in spike belts and kick you out for dancing too hard (hence the nickname \"house of rules\") but I sit up in the balcony and act like I'm VIP those days of effin' up the dance floor are over for me. It doesn't faze me but I think it sucks for the kids coming up. Either way I guess you can go to any house of blues and know exactly what to expect and in some weird way I like that. It trips me out that they have the Sai Baba portrait above the stage."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 2-6 every day! Hello! They don't have anything on Draft, but the drink selection is not all that bad. I mean $3 bottles and $5 drinks. Not to shabby. Plus the food ranges from $3-6 during happy hour ( I believe) so it is not all bad. The jalapeno cornbread is yummy and served to you in a small cast iron skillet. The steak quesadillas were filled to capacity with yummy steak and cheese. I do think my favorite was the bbq pork sliders. Yummy and nicely priced. ( Plus cannot believe I had not written a review about them until now SMH!)"}
{"text":"Inside Mandalay Bay; good food, nicely decorated venue, and great live music!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hidden spot. Love music is so good. Ashley R. is awesome ask for her and she will make sure your time is well spent."}
{"text":"Decent food. Had a salad and my friend got the burger. Salad could have had more tomatoes since it was the only veggie in there but still ok. Considering its the strip, for $8 it was good. My friend seemed to enjoy her burger. It was ok but I think id go back to strip steak before I came here next time Im in Mandalay bay looking for some food."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. Reservation process (via yelp) and the staff were ultra friendly. Great menu, great bar. The issue was the kitchen and more so the food.   First - took us an hour and a half to get our food. Not just us - but no one in the place was getting served.  No explanation - just \"it's coming\".  No apology.   Then - when the food did come - our apps were served at the same time as our meals. We weren't the only ones - I noticed quite a few tables complaining about the same issues.   A couple of our apps were forgotten completely (but of course were on the bill) and only half the dinners were served at once. The others came out sporadically - including mine that was a half hour after the first person was served.   Three of us ordered ribs. They are not fall off the bone. Don't get them or if you do - ask for a steak knife.   Worse - there was a \"red fish special\" for $29.00. It comes out on a huge plate with two pieces of fish the size of your thumb. I wish I was kidding. And it was the only thing on the plate (except the lemon slice which just added insult to injury).   I had the waiter come over and he actually laughed at it when he looked at it knowing that our concern was legit. He showed it to another waiter who too shook his head in disbelief that this came out of the kitchen.   They wanted to take it to the manager so he could see it himself. His response was \"that's the way it is\".  They did offer to replace the dish however we were already 2 hours in at this point.   This place is brutal. With so many awesome options within walking distance of this one - save yourself (and your stomach) the grief and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not a big concert person, but lately I've found myself attracted to shows at HOB.  The tickets are never too expensive, and I feel like it's a good purchase because of the venue size.  I'm not watching a screen, i'm watching the actual concert which makes me happy.   Just a tip for everyone.. If you buy your tickets at the box office instead of Ticketmaster you usually get half off the convenience fees (or at least all the shows I've seen have worked out that way.)"}
{"text":"We visited this place last night for our date.   It did not live up to our expectations.  The band was terrible.  I expected the local acts to be multiple not just one group.   I ordered the shrimp and grits.  It was okay, it had too much liquid for it to be considered cusine.  My date asked for his steak to be medium rare, the order was all wrong.  We both agreed we will not return.  I will take my chances with the one in Chicago."}
{"text":"Santana at HOB.  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.  I would recommend the floor \"seats\" they are much more fun that the theater level.  Didn't eat the food, but had cocktails in the souvenir glasses.  Expensive, but they don't short you on the alcohol - probably at least a double shot.  If you are even a casual Santana fan, this is a MUST SEE."}
{"text":"My friend and I saw Billy Idol at the House of Blues Theater on Saturday night and we wanted to grab some grub before the show. We had no problem getting into the bar area with no waiting. The beer was cold and the food was delicious! The only reason for not a fifth star was our server was slow and took awhile before she even came over. We were not in a hurry so not a big deal!"}
{"text":"Great place! it was real live. i went to see Santogold... and she was great! After that I went to the restaurant and the food was excellent and the servers was nice. A great atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"The ribs are delicious and the gumbo soup! Also if you hold on to your receipt you can come back the next day for a buy one and get the second half off breakfast!"}
{"text":"Oh House of Blues! This is one of my favorite concert venues in Cleveland. It is small and intimate, which I appreciate with live music. They also bring in a wide variety of acts which is nice. The restaurant is good, but pretty pricy. I have been there on quite a few different occasions. I kind of feel the same about it each time. Good but nothing spectacular. We have a bachelorette party there, it was nice but it ended up being an expensive night. We have also been there for karaoke on Friday nights, which is fun but I expected more.    Overall the experience is always consistent here, which I appreciate.   And the corn bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"2 visits in the last few days as we are staying next door at the Delano. First visit was a late bite of a fabulous burger and sausage soup which was great. Service was fun and a bluegrass guitarist on the stage was fun.   If I could give 4 stars for one visit and 1 star for the second, I would.   Second visit was for the breakfast special that was NOT special. 3 eggs small in size dumped on a plate with 2 slices of tomatoes. (didn't want the hash browns). Cold coffee too. What a sorry looking bf. Ordered sausage which came out cold. The super fuel omelette was of micro sized again with some fruit which we paid extra for in lieu of potatoes.., no toast or bread of any kind. I'm not a lover of super-sized portions but this was truly not special in size, taste or presentation.   Our waiter Blade was great and had the cold breakfast taken off the tab. We tipped him well didn't whine and left for Starbucks.   Note to self; House of Blues is great for Blues but not for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went in a large group, 30+, We had a party room and pre ordered buffet. Great pulled pork, staff was very accommodating for some allergies in our party."}

We had an awesome time that really made my night and my mothers night the band gave a shoutout too my mom sweet our server was great as well Chris thank you my friend NAMASTE"}
{"text":"Our first time here ,it's been forever since I've been to Vegas  ,I hear the food's good ,our room is beautiful  and very Romantic  ,can't wait for a candle light dinner with my Man  ,no kids yah. ..We are grabbing a show after  ...soooo much to do..."}
{"text":"I had an ok meal here when some friends of mine were playing.a gig here.  The food was ok.  The venue, the staff here are all first rate.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"The place is a dump. Recently we saw GNR at HRH. Awesome sound, excellent venue, everything the HOB is not. For one thing the HOB makes no effort to restrict the number of people trying to force their way into GA. I'll never buy those tickets again. It is not safe. I'm not sure what the regulators are waiting for, but somebody is going to die in there because of their asinine policies. In the event of an emergency there would not be enough body bags. At HRH the tickets for the GA area in front of the stage are tightly controlled. No one gets in front of the stage unless they have a ticket. At HOB it was anything goes. The sound system needs a rework. Also it would be much more pleasant for the patrons if on occasion the cleaning staff actually cleaned the floor. Wherever we walked we stuck. Ick!"}
{"text":"Nice place to see a concert.  There are different areas for the general admission tickets to watch. The main floor, left or right side of the stage and in the rear of the venue. Three large bars wiTh specials on beers and well drinks is always a plus. Sound quality is excellent and the staff here is very friendly."}
{"text":"We came here recently for Social Media Day with a show put on by Steel Panther, and having attended other concerts before, I think its a cool place to go for a concert, but I prefer grabbing a table and enjoy a show while seated.  Being on the floor is cool, but standing room only? No thanks....plus the claustrophobic situation that follows?...Pass...Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for your own spacious seating area...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(315/365) \"Sit Or Stand???\""}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! $12 for a Fireball Shot? Where are the Strippers? This place has gone downhill since it opened and is a joke amongst Vegas Locals. Drinks are 25% more than even the most expensive Strip Clubs. It would be different if the shows were free.  Security Wanding & Pat Down before entering? Really TSA?  Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I would have given three stars but they charge you an \"entertainment\" tax of 18% when dining here.  They had two guys playing on stage and after we came in they sang TWO songs and were done for the night.  They were O.K. and actually I was glad when they were finished as they were a little too loud and I just wanted dinner.  And the service wasn't too great either.  For dinner we shared the Gator Pizza which was really quite good with just enough kick to it.  And we also shared the Paneed Chicken  which wasn't as good.  It had a strange flavor to it that I can't really describe.  We got a watermelon spritzer drink which was like a watermelon soda and that was really good.  Not sure if I will be back as I feel they should have informed me about the entertainment tax beforehand and the food is just O.K. nothing that I would want to pay an additional tax for!"}
{"text":"I've gone to House of Blues twice - both times because it was a Sunday in the winter and my family and I were in Vegas, and my brothers (huge niner fans) wanted to go to a restaurant where we can watch the game.   House of blues has huge tv screens that play football games on Sundays.   Onwards to the food. Their food is Cajun styled and really tasty. Apparently there's a new chef at this location and he created a new menu 6 months ago.   MUST: get the voodoo shrimp. Omgosh. Jumbo shrimp on fried styled cornbread, soo good.   Another must: get the cornbread. It comes with maple butter. Believe me it's yummy!   Was too full for dessert this time but I remember it being good. Prices are also reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Good venue size.  Saw Blues Traveller a couple weeks ago.  Great sound and not a bad seat.  Paid $26 for a Miller Lite tall boy and a Coots light tall boy (PBR tall boy is $11).  I'd definitely go back for the right band and will definitely pregame before going."}
{"text":"I came here on a work trip dinner after a long day of conferences. There were about 18 people so I completely understand of mistakes happen. The reason why they received a 3 stars instead of 4 or even 5 is because the same mistake kept happening. My co worker ordered her first round of drinks with no delay. When we all finished our first round and ordered seconds, her drink never came. Understanding that it was a big group, we just asked for it again. When everyone is done with their second drink to order the third she asked for her drink again twice. My third drink, which I asked for later than her third request, came out faster than hers. Yikes.  Plus note, their jambalaya was yummy but definitely order it with the shrimp. I thought the WHOLE scallion stalk on top was a bit extra since no one will eat that with the jambalaya......  Tip: New Yorkers: don't expect the buffalo wings to drip in buffalo sauce. Is more a dry rub type of wings."}
{"text":"decent venue. big. places like this are different shows every night, so it is a constantly changing thing. friendly staff. decent cocktails. beer selection wasnt super exciting, but was ok for the most."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast the morning we left Mandalay Bay and Las Vegas. If only we'd known about it sooner. Great food (we got a custom-made omelet and the crab cake eggs benedict) for a decent price (in Las Vegas), fast service, fun atmosphere. Portions are good but not terribly excessive, and the coffee was kind of the best I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"House of Blues is a really great mid-sized venue. I've seen around a dozen shows here and have always had an enjoyable experience. Ticket prices are usually reasonable and if you're a designate driver, non-alcoholic drinks are free (at least the AFI show!) I've normally purchased alcoholic beverages (which are priced as one would expect for a chain venue) when visiting House of Blues, so I'm not sure I got an awesome bartender or if this is their normal generous policy.  I would have given HoB a five, but I just don't get bathroom attendants. I've been dispensing my own paper towels for myself since I was a kid. I just don't need a dude to try to be helpful by placing the paper towels he's offering to dry my clean hands on a wet, dirty countertop with his potentially dirty hands. And if I need cologne, I'll use mine at home. I typically attend metal and punk shows at HoB so a bathroom attendant is a little more \"class\" than I imagine the attendees at these shows expect. I know, I know - it's Vegas and this is fairly standard practice. I still feel it's obnoxious and superfluous.   Bathroom attendants aside, you should feel you're making a good choice if you choose to check out a show at Las Vegas' House of Blues!"}
{"text":"Meh. Long time to get the food. No wait to be seated though. Jambalaya was so so. Mojito was weak. Overall meh !"}
{"text":"The last experience there pushed me to 'Yelp' about it.    I've been to HoB many times since it opened.  At first i wasnt really a fan of their corporate feel, as I like the low-key Agora / Grog shop charm more.  However, now that im in my late 20s i REALLY appreciate the option to have nice, comfortable seating on the upper balcony area.  You get a great view, the acoustics are great, and there's 2 bars up there, very nice!    Ive only eaten there once before, and was unimpressed.  THIS time however our waitress Gina made my day.  I wanted the strawberry lemonade, but knowing it would be half ice i asked if the refills were free - NO \"but for you they are  :)'  Win.  We also had a BOGO coupon - which she let us keep so 'we;d come back again' - very smart, because now I feel like i have to because she was so nice.    We got the fried artichokes and they were phenomenal.  Came with two delicious sauces, cooked perfectly with lemon wedges.  I got the pulled pork sammich for $10 which was a B, good size, good sauce, and the hot sauce tray they had on the table came in handy.    My GF got a burger which was average, nothing special but not bad for a chain.  I didnt like their shoe string style fries but she did, and the cole slaw wasnt bad either.    You get to sneak into the HoB concert when you leave from the restaurateur part which is a plus as well.    For the super thrifty  - she didnt ask to see our Entertainment card  /wink"}
{"text":"Dinner at the restaurant was great. Service was on top of it, maybe too on top of it. The venue doesn't have the greatest sight-lines, can make you feel closterphobic if you're not into dark overly decorated walls and a full crowd, but the sound system isn't too bad. Chances are this is one of the 2 or 3 spots to see a good rock show in Las Vegas, so you take what you can get, eh?"}
{"text":"I attended my first concert here at The House of Blues. Billy Idol was in the House tonight  and rocked this crowd. For a good 2 hours. He played hit after hit, classics  and some new material. He still has the voice  and commands the stage. He put in a powerful show and the band is fantastic. I would definitely attend another concert here. The concert hall is an intimate setting and the acoustics are great."}
{"text":"We enjoyed happy hour with Dave the bartender. He was very friendly and we had a great experience with him."}
{"text":"Saw WuTang last month and Lauryn Hill last night.  My fave part of HOB is that it's small.  Sucks to be downstairs like I was for Lauryn but, thankfully, it wasn't that crowded. Made it easier to walk in/thru. Watching WuTang from the top was great. We had seats, there was no one taller than me, and it wasn't crowded."}
{"text":"First I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak it was gross!  I should have taken a picture. I didn't want to make a scene, and start taking pictures of my food. The cheese was lumpy and disgusting.  So I sent  it back and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. I received a burnt scrawny piece of chicken. So I took my phone out and took a picture. I took a few bites and that was it.  Everybody was finished eating,and waiting for me.  I ended up leaving Hungary paying for food I did not eat. I wanted to complain and lay in to the manager! At the very least get all that crap taken off my bill! I was with company. So I held back. I'm not the sort to hold back though! Especially, when it's costing me money.  In short ... SLOW SERVICE, BAD FOOD,  I felt bad, spending my money in this place! The waitress was extremely unprofessional! She made things awkward from the start with her horrible customer service skills. The place was empty yet could not manage her three tables. They can't cook  a chicken breast! \"What a joke\"   Good concert venue,  horrible restaurant!"}
{"text":"Group of 12+ obnoxious drunk men here for drinks.. KC was the real MVP, even after closing."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but great experiences at this House of Blues. Good food, consistent service, and a friendly staff. I was there a few weeks ago for breakfast and Aune + the rest of the staff were really helpful and pleasant on a Sunday morning. Good way to start the day."}
{"text":"The food we did get was good and the manager has since contacted us personally to apologize and send us something to make up for it.  I'll recommend this place now because I'm pretty sure it was a bad one-off situation and they do care about their customer's experience."}
{"text":"Dude, it's the house of blues... what's not to like... well, like everything. great loud noises (LOL) and they have excellent prices on draft beer. oh, did I mention the killer bass that rattles your clothes - awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ashley R. Is the bomb!!  She truly rocks the restaurant and is one of the most personable waitress' in the biz!  The music is perfect. A MUST if you're in Vegas for a night. You're welcome."}
{"text":"As stated by other reviewers this place was just okay. The food was bar food, nothing to brag about. We weren't there for a show just grabbing some food and drinks.   The real win here was the service. This is the best service we have received while in Vegas. The waiter was attentive, polite, funny. He really made the experience."}
{"text":"We decided to get a little 'touristy' this past Christmas.  We came to Mandalay Bay to see the Shark reef and decided to eat here for Christmas lunch.  SO much better then what I was expecting, which was typical hotel on the strip food. I had the Christmas special which was Prime Rib, Sweet potatoes and mixed veggies and for dessert, chocolate cheesecake.  everything was delicious. not one item I ate was bad and I was so impressed.  on top of that, we had excellent service from both our waiter and at the busy times, the funny bartender, who at one point started pouring our drinks while wearing normal street clothes So at first we weren't sure if he was an employee or just a crazy customer who picked up a pitcher and started doing his good deed Christmas day.   will definitely be back again.  could not have asked for better customer service or food!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR!  Great spot for happy hour food and drinks. Try and the other bartenders are very professional and laid back."}
{"text":"I went with 8 friends. we were sat up front near the band. we could not enjoy a conversation because the rock music was so loud. When they weren't playing, they were talking. By the way, why was there a rock band at the House of Blues?? Our gumbo came out luke warm, we sent it back. it came out hot the next time, but our entire party was sick by the end of the night."}
{"text":"It's good place for breakfast or brunch after a late night out or even after a hangover. I like their coffee and their waffles are great with strawberries! So were their french toast. Will come back if we decide to stay at M/B again."}
{"text":"This is a great little music venue! Okay so don't come here and try to order food and expect great service...it's a music venue and if it's a good night it will be packed...eat after. The sound and light system in this place is great and the venue is small enough where you get a good view from almost any spot. I went on a night Santana was playing and it was amazing...fantastic experience. Sounded great, seats were great and I would come back for any touring artist if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Gospel brunch is a lot of fun, food pretty good and the choir is WAY more entertaining than Britney Spears!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, we based our breakfast decision on the menu that we found online. I love eggs benedict. And one thing that will always capture my attention, is the claim of homemade hollandaise sauce.  Well, it wasn't. The eggs were over cooked and the chocolate milk was warm.....yuck! Outside of that, it was ok.    The waiter was good, service was quick, and the atmosphere was 2 thumbs up. I got a side of their sausage, very good!  Coffee was awesome too.   The waiter did suggest a way to consolidate my dad's order to get him a better deal.  That is knowing your job.  My dad is a fan of the pancake sandwich. A couple of eggs  between 2 cakes.  He was very happy with his.  I would eat here again, I would just order something different."}
{"text":"I going to squeeze 2 experience into 1 review for the House of Blues. I was on a business trip and staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and the very first night I was there, the head of my region decided to treat everyone to a meal at the House of Blues. The waitresses and waiters successfully and quickly handled our entire group in a coordinated effort and made sure our glasses were always full and that all of the food was hot when it arrived at our table. No small feat considering we were a group of over 30.  I wasn't feeling too adventurous so i just ordered a burger, but the burger was cooked very well and the options of what you could add to the burgers were very extensive. My entire group was happy with the food, but if the waitresses says the dish is on the small side, please take her on her word. The Cobb salad was humungous and I will give a second-hand review of \"delicious\".  I had such a good experience the first night that when another, smaller group of co-workers asked me if I wanted to go, I immediately said yes. I went with a group of 4 and got their House of Blue salad and a side order of Sweet potatoes fries (because I just couldn't say no). I was just as pleased the second time around with the food and the service. The best part of the second night was the fact that they had several TV's and it was easy to see game 4 of the NBA Finals. Unfortunately the Miami Heat still won."}
{"text":"Gabriella was incredible and informative.  My drink never went empty!  She brought me cucumbers for my hendricks and tonic which i love.  We came in for a light lunch and she recommended the juicy Lucy because she said it was a must and it was featured on the food network.  Oh my Cheese!  Although not light It is a must because I must be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Best concert venue in Cleveland. Great food, excellent service, wide variety of shows, beautiful surroundings (especially the Foundation Room). Our city is very lucky to have a HOB. I've never had a bad time there!"}
{"text":"Lindsey rocked it as our waitress. Food and drinks as always are the best.  Love the House of Blues."}
{"text":"I got a pretty darn good fillet mignon here - tender, perfectly cooked, lightly but well seasoned - with a pretty good bottle of wine for a surprisingly good price considering it's in the Mandalay Bay in Vegas. The service was alright but the fake roadhouse ambiance didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"We had one of the best Las Vegas News Years Eve's ever! We started out at the restaurant and had a great dinner. Next we went to the show downstairs featuring the Roxy Gunn Project and the Graceland Ninjaz.  We came in with an affordable VIP package for four which covered the show and going up to the Foundation Room to watch the fireworks from the balcony on top of the Mandelay Bay.  I had a couple of guests with special needs and the management team was very accommodating and made this an awesome experience.  As for the non-rockers that have been here, suck it up! It's a music venue and not a library. Crank it up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I always make it a point to come to House of Blues when we are in Vegas. We usually order the lobster mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The atmosphere is fun and the live music is awesome (although it can get a bit loud) every time that we have gone we had received excellent service. Definitely one of our favorites."}
{"text":"We came here twice on our last stay at the Mandalay Bay this past week.  Once for dinner and once for breakfast the following morning to take advantage of their buy one get one free breakfast promo.  Both times were great.  Food and service was prompt an efficient, with the breakfast service especially good.  Our server was very friendly and pleasant to talk to.  I like the coffee, which in part may have been recovery from the previous night, but others in our party agreed too, so it couldn't have been all due to the late night!  We stopped by for bit after dinner for the music which was great, but it was pretty packed so we didn't stay long.  All in all, highly recommend for the food, service, atmosphere and music!    I also visited the Foundation Room on an different visit (business) and that was NICE!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere! Brianna the hostess was amazing. So bubbly and her makeup was on point! Lol. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Saw a show at the house of blues tonight. Awesome venue... Sound was great. Staff was friendly . I would go back anytime."}
{"text":"The douchebags stage managers tried to stop the Matt & Kim set 30mins after they opened at 8pm this past Friday.  So they were going to go 5mins over their half hour time slot.  Big deal.  I paid a considerable amount of money to see this Cut Copy show, and if the opening band (who has a big following) is going to go 5mins over, I don't expect the House of Blues staff to go onstage and start motioning for the band to cut it off.  I expect that kind of bush league behavior at some pay-to-play shithole on the Sunset Strip, not at the house of blues.  If a band is going to go five minutes over, keep your douchebag crew off the stage and let the fans see the show."}
{"text":"The music venue is clean, and well staffed. The sound system is quite good. We ate at the House Of Blues restaurant before the show. The food was pretty good. Not up to the hype expected from other people With whom I had spoken. The service was polite, but on the slow slide. For the food prices, we expected better. On the up side, if you spend more than $20 per person, you are admitted before the other ticket holders. Kind of a nice gesture for eating there."}
{"text":"The HoB is a fantastic place to see a show. An avid concert-goer, I've seen my fair share of shows here and have developed theories and strategies to maximize the fun.  Other than a sub-par performances or equipment malfunctions, a great concert can actually be within your own control. Here are some tips:  Timing - Opening bands generally go on about 45 minutes after 'doors open'.  They play for about 45 minutes as well. Then there's about 15-20 minutes between the opening act and the headliner. You may or may not have any desire to see the opening band, but getting there in time will give you an opportunity to get a great spot, either on the floor or along the peripheral rail surrounding the floor.   Position - position depends on how close you want to be to the band, versus how close you want to be to the bar and restrooms. For all the shows I've seen there, and the frequency with which I have to return to restock imbibing supplies, my favorite spot is along the rail to the right of the stage. You can tuck yourself into a spot along the rail and have relatively easy access to restrooms and the bar, while having a great, unobstructed view of the stage. The acoustics there are not as good as they are on the floor, or on the balcony though. If you wish to be closer to the band, it doesn't get much better than the floor, but it's a hassle to get to and from the floor.   Drink selection - the greater the volume, the better the value.  As I am a person with a larger frame and sausage fingers, I enjoy the PBR tallboys or the my-size 24oz Budweiser. Plus you'll want volume to save on trips to and from the bar, so you can enjoy more of the show."}
{"text":"Service was great, bartenders were awesome recommendations were spot on-food was fantastic steak tacos were the best I have had in a very long time the spicy tomatillo sauce was awesome.  They even gave us to go drinks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the awkward situation of going to Vegas with my husband, my recently-divorced dad, and his new girlfriend.  His girlfriend likes to dance, with is fine with me, so we went here because this is the \"discotheque\" she liked last time they came to Vegas.    It's House of Blues.  You know... it's more of a concert venue than really a club, but whatever.  I was exhausted, but we still stood in line about 30 minutes to get in.  Right before we got in, the girls in front of us handed free passes to my dad and his girlfriend.  So they got to get in for free, dang it, and we had to pay $25.  I was kind of pissed about this, because I could have just easily danced to Montell Jordan outside the club as in, but after a few minutes, a band started to pay called the Spazmatics (spelling?)  The Spazmatics really made the night a lot better.  They were four guys pretending to be super nerdy.  Boris, the Czech-exchange student on the bass, wore exceedingly embarrassing tight little shorts with his white oxford/sweater vest/bowtie.  Others had slightly larger shorts, but had weird glasses or sweatbands instead.  So funny.  The were an 80s cover band, and the singer was surprisingly versatile, and the band had some really hilarious banter between songs stemming from the nerdy costumes and personas.  They never broke character, insisting we say \"HECK YEAH\" when we liked a song so we didn't \"have to put a dollar in the swear jar.\"  I'm glad HOB booked these guys, because they saved my quickly-starting-to-suck-night!"}
{"text":"Pros and cons. The event we attended was an all ages concert, so we expected it to have more kids and more concessions to kids. Fortunately, we decided to get seats because the floor was jammed with adults (standing only) and it would have been hard for kids to see at all. We were told all seats were \"partially obstructed.\" That was an understatement. We could only see half of the stage and much of that was obstructed (not occasionally as we had been told) by people standing along the sides. I did not know the second floor standing area existed until the show began.   The Michael Jackson fan we brought was overwhelmed by the volume of the sound and ended up asking to go home at the first song. Then his parents moved him to an area above and behind us where more people were standing.  This cut the volume,  allowed him to dance, but limited his viewing to blurry, small TV screens. We took him home at intermission.  He was happy, so that's what mattered.  The staff was warm, friendly, and accommodating. One person led my husband to a place somewhere in the building to buy earplugs for our grandchild. All went well after that, but the four adults have no intention of ever returning. Too hard to see the stage and the tv screen for our area was over my head requiring leaning way back to see a blurry picture. I can watch a better TV at home."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast, food was good price-wise good as well. A waitress that served the tables on a balcony was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Decent food. Great artists.  Total bs for GA entry. Waited over 2 hours the line moves forward and they bunch everyone up opening line not from the front. So if you were first you might end up being 20th. Get some queues people."}
{"text":"Steel panther was a good show last night  However the 2 opening acts was an 1  1/2 hours of misery I will never get back  We almost walked out and did not come back"}
{"text":"Went to the house of Blues for the 1:00 gospel brunch & it was amazing! The chicken & waffles with strawberries were so good. The bacon, scrabbled eggs with cheese, home fries & fruit salads were so yummy. The music was phenomenal! What a fantastic way to spend a Sunday afternoon praising the lord & enjoying all the dishes!"}
{"text":"Went to the house of blues for dinner.  I had the juicy Lucy burger which was pretty tasty but was on the small side of a burger.  Additionally it didn't blow my mind and i also thought that for $13.99 for a burger and a medium sized cup of fries was not good value.   Bottom line is I feel this place is a bit overpriced especially for what's supposed to be a bar."}
{"text":"I have always gone to the House of Blues for music events but never for the food.  Just recently I was there attending the Press Club Awards Ceremony and had a blast.    There was open bar where they served some great drinks.  Also, the layout of how they had the tables truly fit with the atmosphere of the place.  I was truly impressed.  For dinner the wait service was great!  I forgot to let them know ahead of time that I would need a vegan plate.  So during the event, they went backed and made a speciality dish for me.  Which I was so grateful for!  The vegan option that I had, was so delicious!  I know the next time I attend a concert or another event, I will make sure I have time to grab some food from here!"}
{"text":"House of Blues located in Mandalay Bay is the one place in Vegas I have to stop at any time I am in Las Vegas. They always have a nice beer selection at the bar, their customer service is always exceptional, plus they offer really good food at a decent price. When I stopped there tonight I got to meet Paul the bartender and Melody the manager, both great people who exude hospitality! Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite venue for a concert.  Its seats a decent amount of people but it also feels intimate.  I was able to catch Teena Marie here a number of years back and was impressed by the show and her talent.  Everytime I go to LV I'm sure to check and see who's performing there because I like the place so much.  One day I will try the Gospel Brunch other's rave about."}
{"text":"What a gem this was to find in the Mandalay Bay. Live music. Great Cajun food. And the ambience is unlike anything we found in Vegas all week. If in the area and looking for some great live entertainment while eating some fantastic creole food, you've found the spot."}
{"text":"I came to watch jimmy eats world since I wanted a show while in Vegas but nothing overly expensive. We had gone to the red square before the concert ad drank alot of vodka and then  purchased a drink wristband  at HOB which my husband ended up taking full advantage of. This venue was small & intimate like others and no view was bad to enjoy the show. Unfortunately we were next to an obnoxious old drunk guy who kept bumping into me and causing me to spill my drink. Didn't realize how smashed my Hubby was either until I noticed he kept singing the same song over and over again lol. I followed him outside for a smoke break and when we tried to return inside he ran straight into the wall and security said he was done and kicked us out. I just couldn't believe after all the heavy metal and rap concerts we get kicked out of \"jimmy eat world\"! Hahaha I was pissed leaving before their set was over and it was only 9pm."}
{"text":"We went here for early evening drinks, so we are unable to see a show.  We opted to sit at the small bar in the back which fortunately had two bar stools just open up.  The feel of the restaurant is pretty cool.  They were able to make good use of beer bottle caps recreating stained glass mirrors and other religious themed constructions, in effect, creating a church dedicated to the blues.  That I enjoyed very much.  What I did not enjoy very much was some of the clientele.  For example, to the left of me there was a long engaging discussion about the \"right\" and \"wrong\" ways to hit a woman.  I think the consensus was that open handed strikes were okay -- ladies, you have been warned.  The female bartenders were tatty and gritty, but amazingly attentive.  With each round the drinks got stronger.  Wine pours pushed the brim of the glass and Cuba Libres became transparent from the very high rum to Coke ratio.  Making the arrangement even more generous, it was happy hour when we went.  So our several drinks came out to very little money when all was said and done.  Our bartender received a nice tip in accordance.    Overall, I am going to say this is a great place for drinks -- just be wary of the customers that may be hanging around when you go.  I think what I experienced was just a fluke."}
{"text":"I am not usually a chain restaurant fan but we wanted a simple dinner and a good place to watch the Steelers game.  This place fit the bill perfectly.  Our server showed up right away to take drink orders and was great about making suggestions.  Being a person that eats small plates, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of choices I had to select from. I went with the pulled pork sliders and they were cooked perfectly!   The interior was pretty cool with a bayou tree filled with lanterns took up most of the first floor.  A HUGE screen television set up at the stage was the perfect place to watch the game (which my guys lost).  I will definitely be going back when we are in Vegas,"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at the HOB. I think it will be my last.  The first drink I got the was watermelon smash and it was delicious. However, I ordered a second one and when I took a drink, there was ibviou9something missing. So, I spoke to our server. The bartender then told her they ran out of mint. Well, the mint is what balanced everything. I find it a bit annoying that, I had to ask in the first place. So, we tried a few other drinks and none of them were up to par with the first smash I had. So, I settled on water and that was that.   I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was pretty good. A bit on the spicy side, but the dipping sauce calmed that down quickly.   For my meal, I ordered the shrimp and grits. I'm a huge shrimp and grits fan. These were not good at all. They made a patty out of the grits, grits were made with water. Then they put it on the grill and grilled it until crispy. The shrimp were big and plain. The sauce wasn't bad. There was just too much of it. Making the entire meal extremely watery. Too much sauce, not enough actual food for what I paid.   Prices were a bit steep. $108 for 2 people. I don't think we'll be returning. I wasn't impressed with the meal enough to give it a second try."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. We have never been dissapointed ! Ok, and the Corn Bread is the best anywhere ! Great atmosphere also."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and beer snack. Fried pickles are very good and the service is always friendly and efficient. Not a mind blowing experience, but you always know what you are going to get and it's decent food."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with my experience here. The delicious food at this establishment was hampered by the HORRIBLE customer service. It took an hour and a half for them to bring out our food(party of 8) and they never came to check on us the entire time or full our drinks. Then when we asked for refills the waiter rolled his eyes. When the food finally did come my parents rigatoni was crazy hot! My dad loves spicy food but even he had a hard time with it, despite it saying nothing about it on the menu. My mom couldn't eat it. My burger(Juicy Lucy) was very very good but overall not worth the experience."}
{"text":"I have never seen a concert at HOB, so my rating is only for the restaurant.  I have eaten here twice for lunch both times I was not picking up the check, and both times I have been disappointed.  The lunch menu is large, but not really inspired and overpriced in my mind.  Our service was decent the first time and horrible this last time.  It took so long for our food to come out (over 45 minutes) that one of my co-workers had to get his boxed up to go.   I appreciate that we had a large group, but a 30-45 minute gap from beverages to the lunch being served is ridiculous.  Also one of the members of our team is a vegetarian, and she wanted a salad (she really had no other option), however the salad she wanted came with steak on it, so she asked for it to be removed and to not be charged for it.  The server said that just couldn't be possible, served her the steak and suggested that she share it with the group.  Weird, and rude in my opinion.    All in all after two bad showings, the House of Blues is off of my list of possible downtown destinations."}
{"text":"My 21st birthday was spent in Vegas, and in the duration of my trip I visited House the House of Blues twice! I couldn't ask for a better place to have gone for my birthday! I love the House of Blues.  This one isn't the first one I've been to, although, I do think that this is probably my favorite one so far. The food is really great here. I love their caesar dressing, and the chocolate cake is to die for.  The drinks are moderately priced, just like the food. HOB is just a great place to come and relax on a lazy Vegas night or to come and jam out with some of music's biggest names to date.  It is usually packed, so it is a good idea to have someone arrive about 30 minutes early to get your name on the list. I love the decor, the giant tree in the middle of the restaurant, especially. The Dia De Los Muertos theme is really great, too.  I shall return to you, House of Blues."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast before heading to the airport. Never thought house of blues served food, but this location does. To eat, I had the bacon avocado benedict, which was good. I also had their cajun bloody mary that came with a little shrimp. That was really good too. Overall, decent place for brunch."}
{"text":"Good venue for shows. Would be better if it didn't smell like stale popcorn, Jäger, and body odor."}
{"text":"Place is joke. Dark, dirty and shitty customer service.   Not customer friendly by any means. Tried to walk around and check the venue out during the middle of the day and was told that it couldn't be viewed when I walked in. Was told to ask my server and was told no again.   Drink service was average and out door patio was average as well. Ordered drinks at 350pm and was told happy hour pricing didn't take effect until 4pm. If your on East 4th, pick it another place"}
{"text":"We came to this location before going to a concert at the convention center in Mandalay Bay. They were fairly busy being as it was close to dinner time but we were seated quickly. The waitress we had was training somebody else. However she was attentive and paid close attention to what we needed. She overheard that I have a dairy allergy and she made sure that all of my food was dairy free without being asked. The restaurant and self is well-kept but noisy which is expected. The staff as a whole is very polite. I wouldn't think being in Vegas that the house of blues would be one of my spots that I would want to return to being as I live in California and we have one here. But I definitely want to return to this location. I am however upset but I don't remember my servers name because I would like to give her a shout out for doing her job and going above and beyond."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  No seating in the dining area so we got sat a a small bar table.  There was a mediocre cover band playing way too loud and they gave us five painful bursts of audio feed as a bonus.      Our food was okay not great.  The butternut squash soup was great.   Pouting was so so.  Both of us got the eggplant sandwich which was decent but gave us horrible stomach pains within two hours...or maybe it was the poutin which we both ate.  Waitress was friendly but slow and not frequent to check on us even though we were seated right next to the kitchen.  She even put the wrong appetizer in for us at first.  The manager apologized for the band issues and gave us 15% off but it didn't make up for it.   $50 for a truly disappointing lunch experience."}
{"text":"So this is the thing...most dining in Vegas has gotten pricey over the years. I might have cringed at paying $16.99 for a chicken sandwich at the beginning of the trip but after a couple of days here you realize that's probably not that bad of a price. Although that's why the buffets are popular because at the Mandalay Bay Hotel The Buffet is $17.99 and includes a beverage. So it wasn't the greatest chicken sandwich in the world but the service was good. Also I really like that they allow substitutions for the fries and I got a huge quantity of quality veggies. They weren't your standard carrots and peas, but rather red peppers, asparagus and crisp green beans.   I got my sandwich to go as I was on my way to the airport and just discovered that I had $24 on my MLife card that would expire within the year. Knowing I would unlikely be back to Vegas that soon, I tried to find a place I could use the credits. Turns out you can't use them in the convenience stores, but you can for any restaurants. So basically my lunch was free and you can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"I was here for a corporate event with eBay/Paypal, and they had rented the whole place out. There was a Journey tribute band call \"DSB\" (Don't Stop Believing) who were very good.   The foods they served (buffet style) was awesome. It was somewhat standard... chicken fingers, pasta, shrimp. There was an open bar, and the drinks were all top shelf.   I had been here before a few times for dinner, and it was very good. The dishes are always large, and the prices (for a resort hotel) are pretty reasonable for what your get. And there is almost always a band... so live entertainment is always a good thing."}
{"text":"I hit up happy hour here one afternoon. It starts at like 2:00pm. Yes, you read correctly, 2pm. Get your half price chicken tenders and cold wine starting at 2pm. It was a deal I returned for twice, I think. I started taking those babies out to the pool with me. The lighting is moody and low. The decor is all house of blues. I mean sort of if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all. But I think there are subtle nuances from place to place. They're not exactly all the same. As it was happy hour (ahem, did I already say 2pm?) and I had to sneak my chicken tenders out to the pool, I did not stay for a show. But one of these ol' days, I will. I certainly will. 5/9/12"}
{"text":"I have seen tons of shows here, they have some cool deals for locals like half off drinks and waived ticket fees. It is in Mandalay Bay and they always have great bands coming through here. I have seen Rancid, Motorhead, Bad Religion, Bad Brains, and a few other shows there this year.   Good times!"}
{"text":"While I've been all over the country, and every House of Blues is pretty much the same, at least they're the same in that they're a great place to see a concert.  Good view of the stage from the entire venue and small enough to make it feel intimate (The Joint or The Pearl).  I especially like the great camera crew that shows the band on closed circuit TV's all over the club.  Three bars ensure you can always get a drink pretty quick, though at a major dent to your wallet.  It's a long walk from the parking garage, too, so be prepared for that!"}
{"text":"This review is for the concert venue (I have never had any experience with the gift shop/restaurant*).   I have been to over ONE HUNDRED shows here, the first being Blue October in 2006 (hey, there was nothing else on a weekday night) and the last being one of the thirty Steel Panther sets I have seen here. Seems masochistic if I really believe this venue is two stars right? Well, one does not have a choice if a show is booked here or at another better venue.    This venue seems to be a magnet for douches. I cannot put it any other way. It's probably the location, because it is not particularly the shows; sets of Steel Panther at Ovation @ Green Valley Ranch go on without a hitch. A Joe Rogan/Deathsquad set goes on without a hitch at the now defunct Playboy Comedy Club at Palms, but here at House of Blues .... ahem ... crowd is comprised of 40% deebags. It could be argued that it is not the venue's fault, but perhaps it is.   I have never been hit with a cup full of beer at The Pearl; seems to be something that would only happen at HOB because of several factors: - security is not respected;  - security -- generally speaking, is not competent, hence why they are not respected; and - bartenders, some of them at least, are inherently rude pricks therefore agitating the poor cheap beer consumer and filling them with unpleasantness (and cheap nasty libation) which later would inspire them to throw a half-filled cup of the shit towards an innocent group of concert-goers due to the clear lowering of standards of decent etiquette.   Ten or more times I have walked up to the bar and asked for a cup of ice water. Ten or more times I have scored the HOB employee lottery and gotten a cool bartender that realizes it is exactly fifteen or so seconds of their time. They give me the cup and I give them a couple of Washingtons as compensation.   Why is it that the one time there is a EDM festival outside (at the beach or the arena or who knows [I did not attend], and the aftershow is in the HOB, a deebag bartender, who years earlier as a regular concert-goer probably was the perpetrator of a thrown beer or two at the same venue, announces to my girlfriend that he would not give her water that was from the Las Vegas Valley Water District. Uh, okay.   Truly nonsensical, especially considering they use that SAME water for drinks, but perhaps they were mandated with selling more over*priced bottles of water by supervisors/management because they were expecting a bunch of thirsty, candykids to be in there that night. Cool; eight dollars or whatever the hell it is for a bottle of Dasani water, which is just tap water from another city, and no tip for the dude behind the bar.  Those other reviews pointing to the gross oversell of the GENERAL ADMISSION/FLOOR areas of HOB-Vegas have it pretty dead on. I have been to, I don't know, ten-twelve different HOB venues and none oversells the GA sections of their concert halls like this HOB does. None have such an impressively poor climate control system either where it seems like it is 120 degrees F during some sets (Common during NBA All-Star Weekend comes to mind).      This venue will never be a Pearl, or a Book & Stage, but it could be as decently solid as HOBs in other states (Dallas, TX comes to mind, or even Chicago, IL [which is by no means perfect]). There are significant problems that are organic to this particular HOB venue and it is quite sad because a lot of decent shows are booked here. You've been warned. - E  *except one time when they were supposed to be the distributor for the LV Weekly advanced screening passes, and they were giving out passes at 11AM, we walked in at 11:01AM, and were informed they were \"sold out\" of passes. Bullshit, and indicative of how this place sometimes operates as a whole. They have some really cool employees, and yet at the same time unfortunately some of the most soured, rude, and outright criminaloids working there as well."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Diana the hostess for being one of the most pleasant people I ever encountered in Vegas. She was so sweet and helpful....you have a great employee!  This review is for the restaurant only.  The menu is New Orleans, with lots of traditional southern flavors.  I had the french toast, which I usually don't care for, but this one was outstanding.  Crispy outside and a fluffy interior made with cinnamon raisin bread.  my friends all enjoyed their meals as well. The bacon wrapped meatloaf had several people moaning and rolling their eyes back in their heads...maybe they were being poked by a voodoo doctor, or maybe it really was that good.  Service was a little slow, but it was authentically New Orleans slow, so maybe it was intentional.  They had Abita in the bottle and the cocktails were delicious.  Stop by!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends. It was pretty dead for a Saturday but then again, Carlos Santana was performing next door so there's that... My friend's enjoyed their dinner and mine was just eh. I ordered the Fried Chicken and mashed potatoes and the chicken was crazy bland. The crispy skin was super oily ( yes, I know it's fried...) but it was a bit much. Will I be back? Maybe for a Santana show...but not for their fried chicken."}
{"text":"We went to the VH1 Rock Honor Awards  after party  which I believe was in the VIP area - so not sure about the typical crowd or main area but it was a fun venue.  The bartenders and servers were incredibly friendly, the music was great, the food decent and unusual, fun, new drinks were served.   I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our server Katie T. is the best server for Vegas!! Great personality and service. Also gives honest opinion to our questions. Made our trip memorable with her advice :)"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for the Sons of Apollo show. It was my second time there. I had tickets waiting at will call and the lady helping me couldn't have been nicer!! In fact all of the staff was very good. The decor, atmosphere and sound was awesome! I got up front and was feet away from the artists both times. Plus, I didn't go home with my ears ringing which usually happens at smaller venues. Awesome venue!!!"}
{"text":"I drove from Buffalo to see The Airborne Toxic Event play on a Tuesday night in the C-Town, and the venue did not disappoint.  I got there early, grabbed a couple beers and met some lovely denizens of the fair CLE.    I could go on and on about how much I loved the show, but that would be a TATE review, not a HOB review.  I thought the sound was excellent (tho standing right at the stage Didn't SUCK) and the venue size and location were perfect.  Also, pretty damn easy to slip from the sides to grab beers from the bar."}
{"text":"We stopped in because we were starving and there was no wait. We should have gone for a better restaurant with a wait! The service was horrible and the food was even worse. The lobster mac-n-cheese made me sick and my 19yo said that the fried chicken made KFC seem gourmet. So gross. Our server acted like he hated his job and was very rude. Absolutely horrible experience and we won't be going back next time we stay at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Like all House of booze's, I usually only come when a good band or artist is perfoming.    Sound is decently well, and you can for the most part have a good view of the stage anywhere you stand, unless it's packed like the night I went to see Social Distortion play.  This place gets negative points for having limited bartenders to a sold out Social D show, having to wait in a line to get a drink is no fun!!!!!  I would come here again though!"}
{"text":"Went to the Yelp star wars event. I have to say Misti and Molly rock! These ladies always put together fun events. I hope one day to become an Elite so I can see what the privileged few get to attend but I have to say the regular events are way fun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the brunch experience I had here. We came here on Easter Sunday, and I am not religious type at all. There was a Gospel group that came in as the performance that afternoon. The total cost was about $40, which sounded expensive at first, but in the end it wasn't a bad deal at all for what I got.  The line itself was a bit of a long wait. Once we got in, the smell of pancakes and syrup filled the room. There was a nice waitress handing out mimosas to the guests, and then we basically just seated ourselves on the bottom level.  The room itself is wide, dark and has a traditional layout. It's a boxed style layout that is traditional with a balcony up stairs that surrounds the whole room. Then you have the main floor and then it drops below floor level. It's about medium sized that you'll get a good view anywhere.  Once we found our seats, we went hunting and gathering for food. There was a omelet line, which only produced 3 omelets at a time. It's about a 15-20 minute wait, but well worth it. The chef was very talkative and engaged with the patrons.  After that I picked up some HUGE perfectly cooked apple wood bacon. By the end of the performance, it was all gone. Also picked up freshly made mini waffles, and sausage.  I am fairly picky about my OJ that it can't be from concentrate. My friends made sure the waitress brought back fresh orange juice. I was very satisfied with it.  Service wise.. well they never came back to refill my drink. I'm assuming they stop service when the performance is on. There was a lady out there giving people new glasses of mimosas.  Performance of the gospel group? Absolutely amazing. High energy that got everyone off their feet, and participating with the audience was fun. Everyone was twirling around their cloth napkins in the air."}
{"text":"Great Ribs & Jambalaya! Nice atmosphere with great entertainment. Excellent friendly service located right outside the casino at Madalay Bay so you can gamble once you finish eating & drinking. Overall the place is really cool the food is awesome & the drinks are great no skimping on liquor at all!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS VENUE!  This is a review for the venue not the restaurant.  This is one of my favorite concert venues in Las Vegas. I have seen too many shows to count starting from when I was in high school over 10 years ago. The thing I love about it here is you are able to see the stage from pretty much anywhere and most shows are general admission. It's a small venue which makes it easier to see bands up close. I used to get up in the crowd when I was younger. Ok, I'm not that old now but I enjoy hanging out near one of the side bars drinking a tall boy and watching my favorite bands at the same level.   The beers are overpriced but really not that bad. They have a wide selection of tall boys and even offer a $5 dollar shot of anything when you purchase one of the tall boys. Mich Ult with shot of Jameson. Yes please! Recently they started serving snack like food in the venue which is nice if you plan on staying a while and drinking. I actually haven't tried any of it since I love going to the Burger Bar before or after shows.   Whenever I hear that one of the many bands I enjoy is playing at HOB, I get really super excited. The only gripe is that the tickets are managed by Ticketmaster which charges ridiculous fees but that's just something we all have to deal with."}
{"text":"For the type of food, it's expensive. I get that these places have to pay rent. However, you can go many places down the e4 alley to eat. We just had a burger. For the price and quality, there are better places. Also their beer is stupidly expensive and worse in the concert. 9.50 for a 24 ounce Miller light it's sports venue prices. Definitely get liquored up elsewhere and get premium drinks. Why get crap beer at craft beer price? Won't be back for a while. Our last concert was on 2015. Next show we'll drink at some other spot and eat at our fave joint in the alley"}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a work conference. Hanging with five of my co-workers. Two of us wanted to sit outside and people watch, but the majority one.  The atmosphere on the inside is very fun. They have a variety of art all over the walls. Jessica was our server and she did a super job!   I have never been here before, so I thought I would experiment with a drink that I had never had before. I ordered a Mango Ginger Press which has fresh mint, ginger, mango, and a splash of lemon-lime soda. This drink is so tasty I might try to make replicate it at home.   I ordered a cheeseburger because I had a craving for one. It's been a while. I did the \"build your own\" with provolone cheese, crispy onion strings, extra pickles and a little mustard. The burger did not disappoint! It was cooked to perfection! They make homemade pickles, and they tasted a little interesting, but other than that, the meal was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The breakfast specials are really good and reasonably priced for Las Vegas. The waitstaff was friendly and fast. Latte was better than Starbucks. We walked over several times from the Luxor to eat."}
{"text":"Much smaller than the L.A. one, but they still have that amazing cornbread, and it appears on the Happy Hour menu...which makes me so happy, I could almost air guitar about it.   Oh, and the bartender was all Rosie-the-Riveter and dealt very kindly with drunk and unreasonable people. Happy to report, I was not one of them."}
{"text":"The menu is very pricy, and since Aaron Sanchez created the new menu, many of my favorites have been removed. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and I am pleased to say it was really good. The pork is extremely tender. My main complaints are with my server. I asked for a kids water, and he asked me if I wanted the cup that lit up. I said yes, but had no idea, I was going to be charged $5 for that cup. Also, he took a really long time to bring the check, and an even longer time to bring me the change. With a great server, I would have given a higher rating."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food & drinks! Purchased a VIP table for DSB Concert 6/2 through Ryan, he was a great host! Gianna served us, she was prompt and attentive. Very happy with the service. Definitely be back on our next trip"}
{"text":"Way down at the bottom of the barrel of House of Blues venues you will find this mistake. This venue made me want to avoid attending any concert ever again, anywhere. Getting in and out of the place is an absolute nightmare. I couldn't imagine there being many survivors in the case of an emergency. The human giving wrist bands needed an attitude adjustment, as did the ticket scanner, \"hand stamper\", and both bartenders that I interacted with. I approached an empty bar only to be ignored by 3 bartenders for several minutes. 2 of them then disappeared into the back while the other proceeded to clean. No thanks."}
{"text":"We came during the day when there were no performances, so this review is strictly about the food, which wasn't good. The section we were seated in was pretty empty. I ordered the jalapeño cornbread as an appetizer and the blackened salmon with a cucumber salad as my entree. The cornbread was dry and overcooked, but luckily there was butter on the side. It did have a nice flavor that wasn't at all spicy like the name would suggest. The blackened salmon was overcooked and tasted bland. Bland bland bland. The saving grace of that lunch was the strawberry mango lemonade. I could have filled up on that alone. Also, our server was very nice and attentive; however I see no reason to return to House of Blues."}
{"text":"Came here feb 13 to hear the pj Barth trio (who was awesome) and also decided to eat here.  We ordered whisky and cokes which came out very quickly and decided to order the full rack of st Louis ribs. Let me say-best ribs I've had in Vegas. The meat fell off the bone, and had some tasty brands and excellent coleslaw to go with it. We also had the banana bread with a whisky glaze that was to die for.   Besides all the great food our waitress, Nicole, was top notch. She was nice and chatty and very attentive. She suggested the banana bread dessert to us. Even if the food was horrible (which it wasn't) I would come back here for drinks just because of her good service. We probably will come back tonight!"}
{"text":"Place is great. We came in for a quick dinner and Jessica recommended the popcorn shrimp (A), fried chicken skewers with sticky maple sauce (solid B) and carnitas sliders(B) - a little dry.  The watermelon margarita was killer. Great atmosphere.  Good came out quickly and hot!"}
{"text":"Here to see a concert. Great atmosphere and vibe. Ordered drinks in the concert venue. A double shot of Jack was $24! I ordered a bud light thinking i would get a bottle like everywhere else and the bartender puts down a 25 ounce can of beer. I ask if they have bottles and she says no and before I can say I will take something else she opens it. No way can I drink all this! Oh and did I mention the beer and two bottles of water cost $34!!!! No prices listed at the bar either. If you go to a concert here DO NOT ORDER DRINKS IN THE BAR!!!!!! Plus the bartender was kinda rude."}
{"text":"I'm a lazy person of habit.  So it should not be surprising that during my last stay at Mandalay Bay, I ate breakfast at the House of Blues every morning.  However, its convenient location and familiarity are not the only things that kept me comeing back.  Quite simply, their breakfast food is AWESOME.  They serve the best bacon I have ever tasted.  And that's not hyperbole....... it was so good that just thinking about it makes me salivate.  They also make a damn good waffle.  And my boyfriend was impressed that they serve 4-egg, rather than 3-egg, omelets.    Their prices are reasonable for Vegas standards (our tab was usually around $26, except for the morning when I ordered four servings of bacon).  And the service is good.  I don't know if I'd make a trip down here if I were staying further down the strip, but if you're in the area, it's a good bet."}
{"text":"The worst food ever that I  had in my 83 years of life. Smoked chicken. Was served cold both chicken and bean \"mush\". Chicken was dry, little chunks was sawdust  taste. Colslaw drenched in white liquid no flavor, no taste no character. Pricy and worthless."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I think 3 starts is about accurate for this place. I've been to several House of Blues restaurants at different locations and loved it every time, except for this place. I ordered my burger medium and got it almost rare and my sweet potato fries, which tasted great, came out cold, maybe room temp. To be fair, I did not tell the staff so they did not have a chance to make it right. I tasted my mom's Cajun pasta and it was average at best. The chicken in it tasted freezer burnt. Wasn't terrible but definitely wasn't great. Service was really good, though- so I tacked on an extra star for that!"}
{"text":"Tonight forever locked in Hotel California with no possible escape. I believe we are referencing Vegas here. After making it through security here which moved fairly rapidly. Time to go into the venue. The warm up band was the Forgotten Door, believe it or not they are actually good. Usually the opening band is audience practice, but the rhythm of the band and the lead singer were awesome.  This band kept the band engaged and dancing. The lead singer of this band was a female and she had a perfect voice that carried a tune too.  Time for the main event the Eagles cover band. This is close enough to the real thing for me. I was not old enough or alive when they started. The Eagles were a main music staple in my household growing up, so to hear this cover band I'll say does the band justice. They played a lot of the Eagles hits and a few that were not so popular. The Eagles frontman Glen Fry would be very impressed with the wonderful tribute to such an iconic band."}
{"text":"The venue had a large open space for standing room, and had 2 bars.  You weren't allowed to leave once you were admitted entrance, but you could go in to a roped area for a cigarette if you needed.  The only way in to the venue was through the Mandalay Bay hotel/casino so you couldn't go out and get \"fresh air.\"  But the sound system was great, the lighting was great, and like I said before, they had 2 bars.  Oh and the bathrooms were well maintained."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here. The food was pretty good but our server was not. However we saw the other server being very attentive and refilling coffee and mimosas. Initially we thought we might go for the unlimited mimosas but in the end we were glad we didn't because we never would have gotten a refill and wouldn't have felt like we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"The wife and I purchased tickets to see R.Kelly and Lil Kim.  The doors were opening at 8PM.  We arrived about 7:45 to find a line forming near one end of the Mandalay Casino by the restrooms.  There was one person checking ID's and giving out wrist bands and moving the line to a second person.  This person was advancing the line as security was checking bags and persons before packing everyone against the wall of the casino.  By this point folks were annoyed as everyone could see how unorganized this process was.  Finally at 8:30 we were moved into the venue like cattle and people didnt know where to go at this point.  There was an elevator that went up, or you could walk downstairs only to take some back stairs back up.  It was confusing because I asked an employee and she gave major attitude as if we should have known the layout of this place.  Also, the elevator only could take about 10 ppl at a time.  Anyway, found my seat and thought this may get better.  The DJ (J-Nice) playing was great, but his set was way to long for a concert to begin.  Lil Kim finally came out and she was good.  Then it was another wait probably a hours or more before R. Kelly came out.  R. Kelly performance was good also.  One of the major problems with this venue is the view of the stage.  The stage is positioned to far back and if you dont get center seats you're screwed.  Overall the chances of me returning to this HOB location are slim to none..."}
{"text":"My taste for music is as moody as I can be sometimes and last week I was feeling hard rock. Luckily, I found out that one of my favorite bands, Volbeat, was performing that night along side Hellyea, at the House of Blues. My husband bought the tickets and we headed over on a Thursday evening.  The venue is not huge but I didn't feel like it was too crowded, just what you can expect from a rock concert. We had seats on the balcony and it was actually very nice to watch the band and the crazy pit from up there - made me be thankful for my upstairs seats. There was one bar upstairs, which also wasn't overly crowded and very easy to access. Security staff was very friendly and helped us find our seats."}
{"text":"Second time eating here without planning it this time was dinner everything was delicious 3 people at our table had the strip steak with the smashed potatoes cooked to Perfection and tasted perfect also enjoyed the app calamari the shrimp and the garlic fries all exceptional as well a couple other people at the table had the fried chicken no one complained about anything plates were left clean for dessert key lime pie while but my all-time favorite was the coconut cream pie Tower High not too sweet tasted perfect still dreaming about it"}
{"text":"When I lived in Las Vegas, I would walk by this location often and always wanted to try their food. Finally got the chance to when I was asked to go on a date dinner here.   When we got here, there was a wait as the place was packed, but was told it would only be 10-15 minutes. We were seated promptly within our wait time, but was too far away from the stage to see who was playing that night. I'm not familiar with the type of music they play here, so I didn't recognize any of the songs, but did enjoy listening to it while we ate.  Our waiter came shortly after we were seated to take our drink order before heading to other tables to check up on them. Since it was a busy night, it took quite awhile for our drinks to come out and for our waiter to come back and take our dinner order. I ordered the House of Blues salad with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The salad was made of fresh greens, red and yellow tomatoes, spicy pecans and feta cheese and topped with a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad tasted fresh and had a good flavor to it. They did add way too much vinaigrette for my liking to my salad. Next time I'll ask for it to be put on the side. The pecans and feta was a pleasant addition to the salad which I normally wouldn't have added. This cost $10. The mashed potatoes were delicious!! Potatoes were of a perfect consistency and had just the right amount of butter, garlic and salt and pepper. Cost $5.  My date got the Pulled Pork sandwich, which came with house made coleslaw and he added a side of fries as well. The Sandwich was full of flavor. There was just the perfect amount of BBQ sauce on the pulled pork. The meat was also done well without it being dry. Cost $14. My date isn't a fan of coleslaw, so he didn't end up eating it. The fries were crispy, but plain. They needed to add more salt and possibly some pepper as well. He ate them, but said he has had better at a fast food place. Cost $5.  Our waiter came by only once while we were eating our dinner. Did try and catch his attention on several occasions, but he was on a constant go between all the tables he was attending to. Finally got our check and it was another 10-15 before he came back with our card.   Would suggest maybe hiring more help during weekends, holidays and busy times of the year. The food and music was great, but service was slow."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and loved the live music! The ambiance was pretty fun too being there was a huge fake tree on the inside with lanterns and a fun, cool decor.  Unfortunately the food wasn't the best. We got the spinach dip which was good! Then our burgers came and well.. Not the best. My husband had the heat seeker, cooked medium. It came out well done and a few of the jalapeños were unbearably hot, and he loves spicy food. The sweet potato fries were cold and some actually tasted raw so I'm sure they were frozen fries that didn't cook all the way.  I got the BBQ burger and again, came out well done and dry. We were looking for good juicy burgers but it just didn't happen.  Our server was nice! I think we will pass on house of blues next time for food. I would go back for a drink and entertainment!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst venue in Cleveland.  They have very strict rules. People get kicked out all the time, so be careful not to have any fun. Also the drink prices are outrageous.  A tall beer there is $10 plus tip... Unreal. Then you go in the bathroom and they have people in there bothering you for money, just because they handed you a paper towel.  Walking around the venue, you can just hear person after person complaining.  It sucks that some excellent bands play here because I want to support the musicians but not HOB. Any other venue in Cleveland, I will guarantee a better time."}
{"text":"Great happy hour beer prices!  I have not seen a show here, but I have eaten here three times.  I came here twice for dinner and once for breakfast.  QUICK TIP:  Eat here for dinner and you get a buy 1 get one free coupon for breakfast the next day!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Visiting for RCPM concert. We have been here several times for that band, as well as Santana. This is a great venue for small concerts. Beer is ice ice cold, but extremely expensive. During this visit we dropped $300 on alcohol and bottled water, not sure how much our friends spent but probably close to the same. We're not even big drinkers. We were here 3 1/2 hours.  Sound & lights good, service quick. Will continue to attend events here as we always have a great time."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a place called \"The House of Blues\" especially since it was located inside such a lavish casino, but I was pretty let down.  The acoustics were terrible. I could barely hear what the opening artists were saying. Gary Allan was a meh concert, but would have been great at a better venue. Plus they had people packed in this tiny bar like sardines. No spot was guaranteed. We nearly got into a huge fight with some very rude people so we left.  Conclusion: I highly doubt I would come back! Oh also I tried to get a drink at the bar I showed my ID to the bartender. He wouldn't serve me because I didn't have a wrist band. I didn't catch the memo, but the people next to me said they didn't even have to show their ID and they got a wristband. HMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is awesome and The food is very good!!! Love eating at house of blues.  But concerts are not handled very good! Mostly the security is all Over the place with rules the lines are a mess after standing a long line for how ever long. (Don't bring back packs u can bring in a really big purse) after u are check u go into another cluster and lose your spot in line and not told what or where to go. if u don't mind that then the rest of the night u can handle. If u are handicapped u are in troubled for Concerts no real room For u and if u do find something u are no where close to anything with no real views also if it's up in the seating area bring a coat b/c it really cold up there b/c you are by the a/c blowers.  Other then that the music Sounds great! bartenders are great!  Cocktail waitress are wonderful!!!  the coast of Drink are out of this world $12 for a 6oz. Cup! With half of a shot of liquor in it Please!!!  And vip seating cost is Dumb!!! For the size of the stage and venue.  I'll Think again before seeing a show here again!"}
{"text":"Recently a friend and I were visiting Cleveland and stopped in to check the place out.    George and Kate were great! Gorge was kind enough to take us on a personal tour of the place, it's absolutely amazing!  Kate was very friendly and happy to not only pour us some delicious cocktails, but also told us of some other beautiful places we should check out before we left town.  The food and service were on point! I couldn't have asked for a better experience!   Can hardly wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First off, let me qualify that I've never eaten here, just gone to the shows.  If I have any real issue with this concert venue it is that I am a little bored of it.  Seems that about half or more of the bands I want to see in Vegas are playing here.  The VIP areas are a little annoying, but this is Vegas.  Maybe I've just lived here too long to be outraged by this, but they really aren't in the way of anyone of average height.  The VIP boxes are lower than the bar area so those of us in the back still get a nice view from any of the three bars.  The floor area is of decent size but can be a bit too crowded for some of the more popular shows.  All in all unless you plan yourself behind a pillar the view is good from just about anywhere.  Sound is no better or worse that most places I've been, though I can remember a show some years back where a band blew at least one of the venue speakers mid-set which was obnoxious."}
{"text":"Always enjoy House of Blues and the shrimp po boy was excellent. Service was a little on the slow side but still friendly. Window seat was great to people watch."}
{"text":"Came here twice for our recent Vegas trip: once for a quick snack/drinks and second time for brunch.    Love the decor of this place, very detailed to create that gothic rock vibe.  Service here is EXCELLENT.  The staff is extremely friendly, relaxed and very attentive.  For the snack, we ordered fried catfish bites with sweet potato fries.  It was delicious!  The catfish didn't have any muddy taste and the aioli tarter sauce they served complemented the catfish well.  Presentation was creative too.  Also, my midori margarita wasn't mixed with enough liquor, but our server offered to mix us another drink or gladly remixed it for us.  For the brunch, it was alright.  I ordered a corned beef hash skillet, but I guess to show they used quality corned beef and potatoes, they didn't chop them up to little pieces but served big chunks of beef and potatoes.  I guess it's just different preferences.  My bf and friend ordered make your own omelette, but I didn't see them rave about it.  However, presentation was good and food was a lot and the our server was friendly and attentive (kept making sure my cup of coffee was filled).  We also ordered some garlic fries which were pretty good.  Overall I would be back for either lunch or dinner, maybe even try to catch a performance here too."}
{"text":"This review is for the Restaurant not the Venue. CAN YOU SAY RIP OFF!  No where on the menu or stated by our server that they automatically ding you for Gratuity and Entertainment tax.  Our bill was $156 and by the time they added on there extras our bill was $209.  Now wait a minute we had a table of 3 not 8 and the band playing was a local blues band not a big production name.  When I asked our waiter why we had to pay an extra $53 dollars he said I don't know but we have to give tip money to the bar and cook.  THE BAR DID A CRAPPY JOB OF MAKING ANY DRINK!  Charged me $11 for a vodka fruit punch that was water down and taste like grapfruit...which I did not ask for.  The one star was for the waiter who was on our table like an ant to food.  He was attentive and friendly.  Needless to say we gave our waiter a little extra but not much since we were forced to pay gratuity in our bill.  My hubby and I are so angry that we will never return to the HOB for food or drinks; next time we eat and drink up before we go and order waters."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered shrimp for an appetizer. It came promptly and there were 5 nice size shrimp. It was delish. I had the taco for dinner and they were very good. Cabbage inside was a nice touch in place of lettuce. Hubby had a ceasar salad. But the best part was we were there to see a show and if you spend 20$ a piece you get early admission to the show. So worth it. We saw Chevelle and the place was sold out. We got a great spot on the rail. I felt bad for some who didn't have such great places as it was packed right. The band was awesome."}
{"text":"Gospel Brunch was a great time with good food and great service. Choir was amazing.  Whole family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Lobster Mac and Cheese they have the best!! They have a large menu and some great appetizers as well as some great cocktails.  I really love the atmosphere there and the service has always been great!! We saw a concert there a few months ago and it was great! The sound system, lighting and venue all were great, but the next time I will opt for a table or assigned seating since I am short it was kind of hard to see, otherwise it was a fun night!!"}
{"text":"Why on EARTH would Chef Aaron Sanchez put his name on any of the food at this restaurant?! Horrible! Tasteless! Don't waste your time on dinner. Perhaps as a music venue it is OK, but the food was disgusting. I ordered an appetizer of chicken wings. Sure the crunch was spot on but it was under salted and spiced. The chicken itself tasted like worn out shoe leather. I followed this by one of Chef Sanchez's signature dishes - a half rack of ribs. One bite into it and I was sorely disappointed. The ribs must have been steamed or boiled. It too was flavorless. To cover this up, it was slathered with a sauce that tasted like ketchup with hints of cayenne. This is not at all what I expected from an Adobo sauce. It was just straight up YUCK! I had it all packaged up to take back to my hotel and was SO angry I tossed it in the garbage as I walked back to my room. Shame on you Aaron Sanchez. Either take your good name off such horse-menure food or fire your executive chef and get someone who knows how to make it the way you intended it."}
{"text":"Since we were staying at Mandalay Bay, HoB was a convienient place to have breakfast.   The options for breakfast were good, and go with the atmosphere of the restaurant and music venue. As a group we ordered blueberry pancakes, omelettes and hash browns. Overall, everything was OK, but lacked any real flavor. The chorizo was more like ground hamburger, and lacked any kind of spice. The blueberry pancake was good, but the maple butter it came with didn't taste like maple at all.  I know its cheesy, but I really did expect a menu from Aaron Sanchez to be more flavorful.   The service and atmosphere were great, and made up for just so-so food.   I also liked the gift shop at the entrance. The cashier was really friendly and helpful, and let us know what kind of live music was scheduled for the next few days."}
{"text":"This is a review of the concert venue.  Not of the restaurant.  I have seen some amazing concerts here.  I have won tickets to the shows.  I have purchased tickets.  Most times the ticket prices are good.  It is crowded.  They pack a lot of people into this small space.  So it gets kind of stuffy.  It is too loud sometimes too.  I know I am making myself older than I really am.  But a venue inside that is so small does not really need to have to sound turned up to 11.  It gets to a point where you can't really even hear the music clearly.  And though it is supposed to be a non-smoking venue, there is a lot of smoking that goes on.  At least at some of the shows I've been to.  I am not speaking of tobacco smoke either.  The pot smoke has been so heavy that I had to leave a couple of shows early.  I don't like to feel trapped with that kind of smoke.  It is a comfort thing.  So while I like this venue for the most part, it is not my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here a few times over the years to see the Reverend Horton Heat. Entrance is easy, VIP balcony is unnecessary, standing-room only venue with good sound and ambience. Always a good time."}
{"text":"I went here for a private party and had a good time.  Really dug the ambiance and enjoyed checking out all the cool stuff on the walls and ceilings.  The music level was just right with a great variety.  We were being served appetizers by staff that kept the rotating.  The bacon wrapped cheese wiener thing was *awesome* but it didn't come around as much.  The rolls were pretty good but a little too prevalent.  The chicken satay skewer though must have been invented to sell more beer.  Overall I did enjoy my time here and I'd definitely return to dine there."}
{"text":"One to two stars, got the Jambalaya:  Marinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce  Wasn't: Spicy Evenly Heated  Had: Delicious sauce A lot of Rice  *Even BJs has a better Jambalaya with more stuff.  Waiter was nice, split all the checks for us, she asked. (A party of 12)"}
{"text":"David was AMAZING! He recommended the best appetizer on the menu, best wine to pair it with & made sure we would enjoy our evening by recommending a club near by!"}
{"text":"The house salad is yummy. I had the veggie flatbread option. Well grilled and the basil arugula topping was good. Hope to get Brittney again when I am here next"}
{"text":"The bacon Chipotle Mac and cheese is amazing.  Correna provided great service, and the HOB atmosphere from the venue lends itself to a great dining experience."}
{"text":"HoB Vegas has some pretty awesome ambiance with a high-ceiling dining room that feels like a court yard, complete with a huge tree.  Service was great throughout our lunch visit but their beer menu could have used some updating. Two bottles brews listed were missing.  The food, starting with the veggie-cheese dip, was good - my Cast Iron Cluck chicken sandwich was as filling as it was delicious! Most definitely upgrade to the sweet potato fries - it's too bad the portion for these was so small; they were incredible!  I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand some of the poor reviews on this one. I've been attending concerts here since high school, and I've always had a great experience. One of my favorite things about this venue is the fact that it can accommodate a lot of people but still feel intimate if you are sitting in the right place.   My days of standing in GA are behind me, but I often purchase reserved seats. Grabbing a seat in Row A of the balcony can be quite spacious and low stress. You can stretch your legs out and still feel close enough to the stage to enjoy the band and see everything clearly.  No music venue is perfect, but I like when my favorite bands play House of Blues. To me, HOB is way more personal than a sprawling arena but still buzzing enough. This location goes through ebbs and flows with programming, but so goes the competitive nature of Cleveland's venues. This House of Blues also has a great Foundation room and rooftop patio, but I'll save that review for another day!"}
{"text":"Dined here for Brunch Saturday morning 3/18/17. The wait to be seated took a while, but the photo booth to the right of the restaurant distracted us. Otherwise, once we were seated our server Pablo was very attentive and provided great service. We were seated at 11:14am and I decided to do the unlimited mimosa's for $20, but it ended at 12pm. So he made sure my glass was never empty! I can't believe it but I was able to fit in 7 mimosa's in a 45 minute period. I am that girl in Vegas, yolo! Otherwise, the egg benedict was delicious, but a bit too spicy for me to order again. However, I think I will make this a go to spot every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"We're local, and this was the worst $50 meal we've ever had - by far!! Tough inedible steak, charred black burger (asked for medium), tasteless frozen french fries, watered down ranch dressing. And how do you fuck up a salad??!!??"}
{"text":"We had a great night eating at this restaurant prior to seeing mastodon. The server was a very nice gal. Even though my order came out wrong he immediately fixed it. The food was delicious!!! We had the jambalaya, house of blues salad & veggie flat bread. Again, service was great & food was excellent! The only thing I was displeased with was that I feel that they should offer more vegetarian options. They have maybe 2 & 1 of them is a salad. Other than that the atmosphere is nice & food quality was as expected for the price."}
{"text":"While my heart is with the more indie-centric Grog Shop and Beachland Ballroom, this is actually a great place to see a show. Fantastic sound, great sight lines, and (for me, at least) consistently nice and attentive servers/bartenders/bartendresses. The bathrooms are also the bar-none finest you will ever have the pleasure to pee in during a rock show."}
{"text":"Favorite place!!!! Edgar and Auggie are the best. Raspberry sours are the best and the gator bites !!!!!! Really the best place for a casual drink and quick bite to eat!!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials, although I think it ends too early... 5pm Great service, friendly bar tenders."}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit. They have live band playing while you eat and drink. The songs they sang are awesome, a lot of classic rock. They also sing very well. The restaurant is very well decorated. The restaurant has a lot of style. Children are also welcomed.   What I did not like was when I explained to my waitress that it was my mom's birthday and that I wanted to suprise her with a birthday sundae. She didn't deliver. My guest has left already. I am bit disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a below average experience here - our waiter although friendly was simply overwhelmed and couldn't serve us in a timely manner.  Drinks took a long time to come out.  We asked for a dipping sauce for the wings and we couldn't wait any longer and ate them without it.  Our main course was brought out while our dishes from the appetizers were still on the table and we didn't even get silverware having to take them from other tables because we wanted to eat.  We were also put at a table right in front of the band and when I asked to for another table I was told that they didn't come on for another hour so we should be OK.  Well, they started playing  20 minutes later and we couldn't even have a conversation.    They need more staff and no one should be put at a table right in front of the stage if they're there for dinner - it was just uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Observations of my first visit to Cleveland House of Blues, Mar 13, 2018 for the Eric Johnson show. I was with a fellow musician friend from my rock group.   We arrived at 630 PM and decided to have a drink in the lower bar. The drinks tasted good and came to 12 dollars, no big deal. I handed the server 22 dollars for the two drinks. He casually said \"keep the two fives ?\" I thought that is a quite excessive tip request, for a two drink order. I took my change back but did tip accordingly.  The show did start at 8 PM, which I felt was professional. Before I proceed, I want to be clear that the talent all evening was very good but the sound system needed adjustment. I noticed during a brief pre-show announcement - portions of the mid-range really needed tamed. It had a noticeable effect on intelligibility of vocals. In the area of 315 to 1K or so...  The FOH rig is an 8 box line array each side. We were seated in the center, near the front, of the balcony. The top two array enclosures were certainly sufficient coverage for that seating area. The mid-range 'honk' was observable in all areas, balcony and floor.   Considering what I was able to hear, there is enough horsepower driving the arrays and subs. And I imagine the drive(s) are quality pieces, and was likely dialed in with the proper testing equipment, but does need the (qualified) human ear touch on the FOH overall EQ. I imagine the drive(s) are password lockout. Separate main EQs, for \"touch up\" may be in place at the console position ?   Dismissing the EQ situation, what I heard is:  Drums - decent channel(s) EQ settings. Rack and floor toms a bit low in level. There were two overheads, which is good, but the audience missed a lot of the excellent technique on the ride and high hats. The drummer was top notch.  Bassist - the tone in FOH was very dull. I grasp the featured instrument was Eric's guitars, but the sound was like the bass guitar tone was turned completely down on the instrument. Perhaps that is what was desired (?) I wish I could have heard more differentiation between the notes. Bassist was an excellent performer.  Guitar - it sounded pretty good in FOH, and the mids issue is not as noticeable on a guitar, as it was on vocals. Eric is an amazing musician as we all expected to see.  The interior of the facility is quite interesting overall. I have read other comments on the sound system, and I think it would be of benefit to tweak the FOH EQ settings. If people could hear an A/B comparison of the before and after adjustments - they would appreciate the improvement. The installed equipment is undoubtedly able to sound awesome after adjustment."}
{"text":"Saw Social D here last year and it was the best show I've seen!! Great venue. Got crazy packed in there and the drinks are a little pricey but it's Vegas!! What do you expect? Standing towards the front was awesome!! Then, I realized I had to use the bathroom. Bad idea to drink that redbull and vodka so fast. So, my hubby and I pushed our way through the crowd only for me to wait in a line..boo! Bathroom was decent. Would love to come back to see a different show!!"}
{"text":"My five star experience was seeing Jurassic 5 here!  I can't speak for the food, the bar, or anything else.  Just the fact that this is a fantastic place to see live music.  Small, intimate venue with great acoustics.  Keep in mind that shows start right on time when it's all ages, which is why we missed a large part of the show (which was a huge bummer, but my own fault).   The sadness of missing most of the show was quickly washed away when my two friends and I were invited backstage and got to chat up Akil, Soup, and Chali 2Na of J5!  I swear, they must be the most grounded, friendly hip hop artists on the planet!  What an amazing night!  Thanks, House of Blues, for hosting J5 this week!  They are some of the best performers I have ever seen....totally exceeded my already high expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing it's small compares to the other buffet places. The Gospel Brunch is expensive $60 bucks for one but it's worth it. Live Gospel band is amazing also. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I had been here once or twice before.  On those trips I didn't have a negative experience, but it wasn't a good one either.  The first thing you should know about my most recent trip (and what will be my last) is that someone got stabbed in the crowd.  This is the fault of the venue.  Security is a joke.  When entering I watched multiple go inside after the metal detector wand had beeped.  The overcrowding in the General Admission area certainly didn't help the matter.  Due to the stabbing, security (and later police) roped off an area of about 15 square feet due to it being a crime scene.  This of course didn't help any of the crowding concerns.  The blood puddle was left untouched which is important for the crime scene, and we should be able to continue the show right?  Nope, after 2 or 3 more songs the concert was ended early.  The ticket prices are ridiculous at this venue ($60 after fees for general admission).  It's even worse knowing that the concert still had at least 30 more minutes.  Not only did I feel unsafe because of this venue, but they also essentially stole $20-$30 from me.  EDIT: One employee has contacted me through yelp regarding this review and apologized for my bad experience.  I appreciate it.  I have also sent some letters to some managers and directors as well.  I will try to update further if anything happens.  All that said, the review will remain at 1 star as that was my experience of the venue.  It would take a lot to get me to return and re-evaluate my rating.  I would not re-evaluate without actually returning.  EDIT2: House of Blues has responded to my letter and has sent me a gift card to compensate for my bad experience.  I'm very happy that they responded to my complaints.  Hopefully soon I'll have an updated review and a much better experience to share."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for a late night snack during our recent trip to Vegas and we were not impressed. Basically, both the food and drinks were pretty awful. My mom ordered a Mai Tai and I ordered the BBQ Pineapple Mojito. First off, I love mojitos and I especially love pineapple. Unfortunately, my drink was so bad that I couldn't drink it and had to send it back. It was watered down, didn't taste like pineapple, didn't taste like any sort of mojito I've ever had (mint floating in it but didn't taste like mint), and had a funky flavor that was unappealing. The waitress was very nice, apologized, and offered to get me a different drink. I politely declined, since I had tasted the Mai Tai and it was just okay. I had a feeling the rest of the cocktails weren't going to hit the spot. The only good thing was that my mom liked her drink because it was very strong.   Additionally, my mom was hungry, so she decided to order the Grilled Vegetable flatbread - this had basil pesto, goat cheese, mozzarella cheese, roasted artichoke hearts, broccolini, roasted red onion and micro basil leaves. There was something wrong with this. I took a bite and could not take another. It had an off flavor and I couldn't tell what it was. Maybe the bread? Maybe the pesto? One of the veggies? It was bitter and sour and ... possibly fermented? Not sure. However, since we already sent my drink back, my mom didn't want to send the food back and she continued to eat it but without any gusto or enthusiasm.   Overall, the place was extremely crowded, the waitstaff was understaffed, the food/drinks were awful, and I don't think I'll be back. If you are in the area, try another place."}
{"text":"Great venue to see big name and not so big name acts from around the world.   The staff is great and always ready to help any way they can. Coming in for a concert we were running a bit late, missing dinner, and it showed. The doorman told us not to worry as we could grab a bite in the hall. Traditional pub fare it none the less. It was all we needed."}
{"text":"This venue may have been so awesome to me because I flew in from NYC and I'm used to douchebag security. I went here recently for a Green Day show and I can honestly say the venue is set up perfectly. The size is perfect and you have options of how you want to view the show. The whole venue is GA -- There's the \"moshing\" area which is right in front of the stage, and then there's a small gate behind the moshing area and on the right side for those who don't want to deal with that nonsense. Both of those sections are elevated so you can see overhead and also include stools and tables to drink, eat, whatever. You can pretty much see wherever you stand in this place. Upstairs seemed to be mainly reserved/VIP seating. There's a girl that comes around taking drink orders. When I was leaving, one of the security guys offered to walk my girlfriend and I back to our hotel (not in a creepy way at all, just being a gentleman for no reason). Overall great experience."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick breakfast before a flight and the service was outstanding. Aune swooped in took our order, got it perfectly, and was on top of coffee refills all in time to catch our flight.   We ate at some expensive restaurants and this was by far the best service we had - next time in Vegas we will be heading there for their breakfast."}
{"text":"This review is only for the restaurant itself and not the music venue.   I've been to this restaurant twice now for our usual holiday meeting. We take up the bigger conference room in the back of the restaurant since there are quite a few of us. And both times, my coworkers and I have had an amazing experience.   Their service is on point here. Our waiters have been super patient with serving a big group like ours. Some of my coworkers are a bit demanding, but the staff was always there to get whatever they asked for. The food always came out within a reasonable time. The portions of food are ridiculous, a bit pricey, but worth it.   The food here is good. I don't remember what I ordered the first time we were here, but this time I ordered the meatball sliders. The meatball was rich in flavor and the marinara sauce wasn't too tart. The bread still had some crunch from toasting it, which I like. I also ordered the House of Blues salad which I thought was just blah. The lettuce was a little wilted and could have used more dressing. I know my coworkers enjoyed their food since everyone was raving about how good everything was. I did eat a few sweet potato fries from someone's plate. It could have been cooked a little, as they were soft when I but into them.   I enjoyed coming here for our meeting. It definitely beats having our meetings in one of our stock rooms. We will definitely be back for our next one."}
{"text":"Came from Pittsburgh for a concert. Great venue for a metal show! Staff was friendly and helpful. Great setup for a concert, we found a good spot and didn't move but it seemed like there was lots of good places to stand to get a good view of the stage. Acoustics were great, even after a loud metal show my ears weren't ringing at all like happens in some venues. Beer prices actually weren't horrific for a concert venue and we always got quick service, friendly service at the bar.  Restrooms were clean and I was pleasantly surprised by the shelf in the ladies room stalls, a place to sit my beer and phone! Genius! It's little things that make me happy.  Would 100% make the drive again for a band not stopping in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great venue to see Billy Idol last night. Only reason why not five stars are a couple of issues; the ticket price was a bit high at about 200 bucks each in the 200 section. Sat directly under an air conditioner vent that was freezing. The bar was the slowest I've seen in years. I gave up after 10 min but luckily a server came by and I ordered from her. The location is impossible to see the entire stage. Especially when people in front stood up. I would suggest to get the seats directly facing the stage but it will cost you! They are going for 300 bucks!! The severs were great but do not wait in line for the bars! Amateur bar tenders and really slow!!!"}
{"text":"After watching the concert of breaking benjamins we decided to give this place a shot,  we ordered the pulled pork sliders as an app, the shrimp jambalaya and the lobster mac and cheese .  I have to say the food wa excellent and our server was good too"}
{"text":"Only sat in the bar area for happy hour however we were very pleased with our service. Hosts were all friendly, bartenders were extremely quick to serve and made excellent recommendations and had no wait at all between apps and drinks. We most definitely Wil come here again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple of weeks back for the Blue October show. I'm a big fan!   First off - this House of Blues is a little different. It's built into the Mandalay Bay casino, so it can be a little disconcerting. Even more odd - the House of Blues preserves the House of Blues theme - in the middle of the gaudy casino floor. So it looks a little off.  All that changes when you get inside. Inside it's your typical House of Blues. Restaurant out front and concert theater in the back.   We were fortunate enough to be in the \"secret\" James Brown private room that overlooks the stage at the back. We had our own cocktail waitress who brought us drinks all night and we also sampled the menu.   Of the food that we had I remember the Chipotle Chicken w/ Hominy - Delicious! I recommend ordering this highly. It was so good that you'll want to lick the plate - seriously!   After the show we rode the elevator all the way to the very top of the casino to go to the afterparty in the Foundation Room. Bottle service was had - very prompt and attentive service indeed. The Foundation room is split into two parts - public and private. The public area has an outdoors area where you can actually go out and look at the strip.  My only complaint is that the middle aged white dudes in there couldn't dance worth a crap and made some very questionable decisions. Additionally, one of them thought it would be a good idea to \"dance up\" on a gogo dancer and got removed from the premises.  The show was fantastic, the service was fantastic, and the food was delicious. I recommend catching a show here!"}
{"text":"Came in from L.A. for Billy Idol show..... Dined here with my wife ....... Food was on point....... My steak was perfect! Exactly how I ordered it ! Staff was very attentive! I felt very taken care of ! Chris was our server......"}
{"text":"First off - this review is only for the concert going experience. I don't think I've every actually eaten here, and don't really plan to.  I've been here quite a few times since I've lived here for concerts. I've actually been to this venue more than any other in town for concerts.  The last concert I was here for was just this past Friday (Keane with Ingrid Michealson and FRAN HEALY from TRAVIS). The most recent time before this weekend was in October, so I can't really rate on that experience. I've never actually gone to a concert for the almost sole purpose of seeing an opening act (if you couldn't tell, I was there for Fran from Travis). The tickets for this venue usually cheaper than other places on the strip (these were $28 for GA...however, I paid over $15.00 in taxes and fees for each ticket). I've never encountered a completely sold out show, and the will call window is super easy and doesn't typically require an additional fee. The box office staff at HOB are great. Very friendly and very helpful, this was no exception. The ticket and front security are also efficient and pleasant. They don't seem to get too upset when you are waiting to get into a show.  The only staff that aren't always good is the inside security. Often times they get a bit assertive about phones and cameras when their really is no need. However, I can see this as a good thing when people really are out of control...which I've seen a couple of times. As for a concert venue, I really think its odd that they have bathroom attendants. I am at a  standing room only concert where I paid $30 for a ticket...I don't really need a bathroom attendant...I guess its charm. The drinks are priced pretty typically for the strip. I had a 24oz Miller Light for around $8.  Usually the sound and lights are good. This past concert was not good. The first two acts everything seemed to go okay. But when Keane finally started (after what seemed an eternity) the sound was off, and it never really got clear into  the show. My biggest problems where that a) the staff didn't let us know there was technical issues, despite us being able to see they where having problems. b) they didn't get their stuff figured out  to make the sound better, leaving me (maybe I was the only one) with an incomplete feeling from the show. They finished their set, but I couldn't say I 100% enjoyed the show, despite being a fan.  If I could I'd give a 3.5 because I've seen some amazing shows here. However, its going to be a 3.0 until I can get back to see they still have their act together."}
{"text":"Went in for a drink before a show. I asked the bartender for an old-fashioned. I got some sort of red colored, sugary drink. I asked him why it was red, and he told me that it was supposed to look like that and it was probably just the lights. It tasted terrible and he didn't offer to remake it. I order old-fashions frequently and I have never got anything so weird, I thought it was a standard drink that bartenders knew."}
{"text":"For great food and some of the biggest names in Rock this is the place. Watch for performances with Rock N Roll Fantasy Camp. Some of the biggest names in Rock will be only feet away!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  The bartender didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  We ordered food and I asked her how many sliders were in an order and she said 3..it was only 2.  She did not apologize or try to fix it, I had to ask two other waiters about the amount.  Once we got a table our waiter was great but his shift ended and it just went downhill even more.  Our new waitress only came to the table once and when we were ready to leave she overcharged us and didn't seemed to concerned with trying to figure out the bill.  We are locals and not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"Everything 80's has meetups there - big fan of the music so I attend the venue.   No deals on drinks or food, much less standing room only, so be sure to discern which show is worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading poor reviews of neighboring restaurants and was pleasantly pleased with the choice!  Husband ordered the catch of the day - blacked tilapia with garlic mashed potatoes and snow peas, cooked to perfection!  I ordered the ahi tuna toastada appetizer as my entree and loved every bite of it!  We drank a few cocktails and ended up sharing the key lime pie which was not a disappointment!  Definitely an A+ for us and a recommended spot on 4th Street."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! The waitress was really really attentive. The only downside was the band playing. We went there to see the band and eat dinner, but ended up leaving because the band was terrible."}
{"text":"I loved the intimate venue however the food was not very good. I had pancakes which how can you mess up and my husband had eggs benedict which were horrible. Go only for the entertainment."}
{"text":"Live music venue located on the casino floor in Mandalay Bay.  Tickets can be purchased online or at the box office.  Tip: it is worth it to get VIP. It is $150 and you will be seated at a table in the VIP section with your own waitstaff. The $150 is actually a tab so you order drinks up to $150 and anything over you pay out of pocket. Drinks are still expensive but not as bad as other strip venues.  We had a great time seeing Steel Panther and had a great view from the VIP area."}
{"text":"GREAT live music. But the wait for our food was ridiculous!! We ordered the lobster mac an cheese and it took 30 min to come. So irritating! It wasn't that great a lot of pasta with no cheese. Had to add Tons of hot sauce"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and they rape you on drink prices.  No specials.  There handicap accommodations put you in fire hazard areas and complain about putting you there or having to escort you to the restroom.  No restroom access.  Only reason I ever go to a show here is because I get free tickets, drink before and order 1 beer.  $20 tall cans WTF!?"}
{"text":"Will I \"out\" myself as an old lady by saying this venue reminds me of the Odeon? (a long lost concert hall in the Flats - RIP)  Despite the fact that HOB has been in CLE for like forever now, I saw my first show there last night. Crowd surfing ain't my thang anymore so I stood upstairs behind the assigned seating to watch the show. The sound was good and there were video monitors in case someone 7 feet tall decided to stand up in front of you and block your view. (I'm talking about you, dude, in the ugly pullover)  Yes, drink prices are astronomical. But there are at least 10 other places within walking distance to get a cheaper drink. Pre-game before the show or sneak out during one of the opening bands' sets. That's what my friends did. (HOB gets bonus points for letting you leave the venue and come back!) I do think the pricey drinks keeps the jerkery to a minimum. Kudos to the attentive security staff who had no problem literally dragging out anyone who got out of line. Ain't nobody got time for that.  I'd definitely go back to see another show at the HOB. It's a nice, relatively intimate venue to see your favorite band or an up and coming one. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The stage is too high to make this a truly intimate venue. If you happen to be up front you will constantly be having to back up because that is the route that the servers take to deliver food and drink. Would love to talk to the jackass who thought that was good idea. Also, they need a new sound guy or system, either way the sound is terrible. Other than that, how was the play Mrs Lincoln. There are better venues around town, Brooklyn Bowl (Plus the food is better) Hard Rock Live (Again the food is better) So unless it's a band that you must see go somewhere else. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"There for a concert medley of local Vegas bands.  The first thing we hear when we enter the room is a man screaming into the microphone,  \"sit on my d#@k\".  Not what we were expecting. The techno music between bands was popular music and well mixed. We stayed through most of the next band, but decided to leave because the music wasn't really what we had thought the evening was about. To be honest, we thought it was a comedy show.  I'll be there in the future, no doubt, for some other show not involving sitting on d#@ks."}
{"text":"Was there last night... upon entering and going down the stairs that were wet I fell. I was ok at first but then my knee started to hurt so I went to the bartender who saw me fall and and asked if there was somewhere I could sit. She and the guy working vip referred me to the ticket window to ask for ADA seating, explained to the girl at the window what happened and she didn't wanna help so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was quite unempathetic about it. Basically did not want to help accommodate at first until I raised a stink about it. She stated she didn't know if she could accommodate myself and the three people I was with. Once she finally decided to it was ok to accommodate someone who fell in their establishment due to wet stairs, we get upstairs that was closed to everyone else, and there was only maybe 30 people there. Empty seats everywhere but only I was allowed to sit on a stool and my husband and friends had to stand behind me. Worst experience ever! First and last time I go. I should've just laid in the floor after I fell and had them call an ambulance and sued the crap out of them! The manager never once asked if I was ok or apologize for negligence of the wet stairs. The staff upstairs was also very rude and quite mean about it. This place deserves no stars! My knee is hurting pretty badly today, so if I end up at the doctor they will be hearing from my attorney!! Terrible customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a shame.  It's a great place to see a show but I have two huge gripes with this venue.  The first being they still charge you service fees at the box office for shows.  I'm okay with a dollar but I've been charged upwards of ten bucks per concert ticket.  My other gripe is they don't let you tape the shows.  There have been shows I chose to go to that I wasn't as stoked about over shows at the HOB simply because I didn't want to have to pay the exorbitant fees and have to pay for parking on top of that.  Oh yeah, the parking situation?  You are going to shell out at least five bucks and if there is a event downtown that night?  Expect at least 10.  Bands need to stop playing here and go back to playing the Agora."}
{"text":"One of my favorite music venues anywhere @hoblasvegas is small and lively with CHEAP ticket prices and BIG name talent.  The cafe is another story-OVERPRICED and just ok food.   The menu is pretty limited and mostly cajun/creole dishes and sandwiches.  I got a burger an order of sliders and 2 iced teas=$35!!! WTF!  NOTE: Burger Bar is upstairs"}
{"text":"Well here with some coworkers to just chill really nice relaxing had a drink or two just real kick back servers are nice and on it"}
{"text":"I went to the HOB for an event and they have two many venders set up! It was hard walking though trying to see everyone. They had 3 tiny bars, I can't imagine how busy the bar is when a sold out concert is going on. The wait line must be for a drink. The location is great near E. 4th and plenty of restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner last night after checking in. We were seated quickly but for whatever reason the hostess tried seating us in a far off corner where we could not see the stage and we had to ask for another table. The waitress arrives and takes our drink orders but looked and acted as if she was above doing her job . She had an obvious attitude as if we had made her life choices. I received a glass of water before my drink arrived and it tasted fine , like water but after my drink the waitress returned and refilled my water glass with SOMETHING from a pitcher that tasted totally funky. I was livid but it was loud as karaoke was going and I really didn't feel like going through it , I simply asked for my check and intended to have my drinks on the casino floor. After about 10 minutes the waitress returns with the check which I quickly review and hand her my card . After a few minutes she returns with my card and hands it to my husband. What! I had had it with this nut at this point and left her a tip that reflected her level of professionalism. The whole experience was very bizarre and I will never return. I spent most of my evening wondering what this psycho had put in my water and why. I will never return."}
{"text":"Just one of many identical, cookie cutter HOBs in the U.S. The sound is really horrible and the drinks are pretty expensive, which is par for the course. They carry tall boys though, and that makes me happy. Also, if you are just a wee bit surly to the surly door guys (not all of them are, by the way) they might just smile & be nice to you. At least the club is conveniently located in Public Square."}
{"text":"We went for the Blues night (Mon & Wed nights) - awesome music, great vibe. Had the sweet potato fries ($4) with a side of the Jim Beam BBQ sauce - GET IT! That was one tasteee snackalicious snack. Friend got the chick tenders w/fries - spiced in a way that made her sneeze, cough, lick her lips and go back for more. Be aware -you can't have just one of those fries. Think we're going back for acoustic night tonight!! BooYa! Its fun to live in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a drink and an appetizer. The margaritas were reasonably priced for the strip (only $6!), but they were REALLY inconsistent. Our first round was pretty good, but our second round tasted TOTALLY different. It was almost like completely different drinks.   I had the blackened chicken taco appetizer. I'm not convinced they actually gave me chicken -- I couldn't tell what kind of meat it was! That's a problem. Seeing as I was hungry, I ate it anyways. The flavor was okay, but I've had better tacos.   I would have given this place two stars, but I gave an extra one because the live music is always fun."}
{"text":"The service is so very slow.  It took far too long just to get our drink orders in.  Then another millenium went by waiting for them.  Then the food came out so much later.  Our server was friendly, but it could not make up for the tremendously slow service.  No, it was not that busy either.  The food is just ok at best.  I ordered an omlette and it was edible, but not much better than that.  Just no flavor.  I knew better, but I let friends make the choice.  Never again."}
{"text":"VENUE REVIEW - not the restaurant   Here's the dealio with HOB: For a long time they genuinely were a venue that did absolutely nothing to cater to locals. They jacked up prices and made concert goers pay outrageous random fees. Which, by the way, you will STILL have to pay if you purchase any tickets for this venue on Ticketmaster. A ticket that starts at a base of $25 will end up costing you $37 by the time you finally purchase (no joke here).  So, as a local, I do have the ability to purchase tickets directly at the box office and if YOU are a local, I suggest you do the same. I recently went to see Jimmy Eat World here and purchased my ticket on site. SHOW THEM YOUR LOCAL ID before they punch in the purchase! They will waive the fees AND you will receive a pass that gets you a percentage off of drinks in the venue on the night of the show. YAY!   The night I went to see JEW, it was an all ages crowd, which is always a little annoying, but I digress. I do think HOB is a nice venue and it is versatile. I have seen many shows here: Ghostland Observatory, Less Thank Jake, Reel Big Fish, and also, Adam Carolla doing stand up.   The JEW show I think was over-sold. There was just WAY too many people crammed in the venue. HOB has a special vibe, it has a good bar staff and an intimate feel - and you should not have to be crammed up against someone like you're at freaking Warped Tour when you go there.  I really think they should streamline their process of getting in as well. Do I REALLY need to be asked 3 times to show my ticket? Especially when I already get in the venue and have two paper bracelets on my arm? Digging my ticket out of my purse once I've walked down the stairs is just a hassle, and is unnecessary.  Anyway, every concert venue in Vegas over-prices their tickets in my opinion. They know they can get away with it because so many people from out of town come to see shows here, but at least HOB is now offering the locals discount."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a causal Friday night! Their patio/outside section is the perfect spot to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy some people watching (especially the parade of Indian fans chanting through East 4th St after a big win);  while inside features high energy karaoke and live bands. The menu has a good spread of food options and drink selection- though the price tag on their cocktails being $12-16 a piece is too steep for my taste- leading to my selection of a Mango Ginger Press \"refresher\" which was fannnntastic- the blend of Ginger Beer with Mango was reminiscent of the SBx Peach Green Tea Lemonade that I love so much. The BBQ flatbread was solid, but nothing amazing.  The staff was friendly and kept thing moving- though they did have to have a manger come out to verify the Yelp 10% discount.  The atmosphere/location is what really saves this place. The food is pretty good- just a little pricier than the quality."}
{"text":"House of Blues Gospel Brunch @Mandalay Bay: thank you for ruining both my appetite and my Mothers Day.  My husband purchased tickets for us to attend the first seating of the Gospel Brunch on May 11. We arrived on time at 9:00 only to stand in line for 20 minutes just to get in the door. We were not seated until 9:30, at which point the venue was clearly overcrowded and overbooked with lines of people, tables that were too close together and wait staff that were nowhere to be found.  I decided to sit down to try and wait for the food lines to die down with no avail.  I was one of the last people in line in the traditional food area. Imagine my disgust as  I and a number of people in line discovered that the plates stacked on the table to self serve ourselves buffet-style were actually a stack of used filthy disgusting dishes with old food on them. Every other plate had stuck on food, wet slime and garbage on it. Not sure how such a gross error can be made with a huge catering event...I have been on many cruise ships with 20 times the amount of people served and have never experienced anything like this in a dining establishment in my life.   I proceeded to take some pictures of the filthy dishes and went to find a manager.  As they looked for the person in charge a couple of bartenders were actually laughing when I told them what happened. I'm not sure what part of a potential outbreak of foodbourne illness is funny. I'm sure the Nevada Department of Health will agree  with me when I call them first thing Monday morning.  One of the busboys was very kind and actually came up stairs to the ticket office and appeared to be genuinely sorry about the whole thing. The on site manager was nice enough but didn't seem too concerned that many other people eating from that buffet line were eating off of dirty plates. What was supposed to be a lovely Mothers Day turned into a nauseating experience. Our money is slated to be refunded  to our credit card but honestly I was so sick to my stomach that I couldn't eat till much later in the day and didn't care about the money at that point.  Please people, be aware of where you eat. Scroll down to another Yelper who posted a similar review of the exact same brunch only 3 weeks ago."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times to see my favorite band of all time HIM. The first time was back in 2005 I believe. My friends & had GA tickets. We wanted to be up close on the rail so we ate @ the place to get early admission. I remember the food being good & that's about it. We were just amped to get into the venue & get a good spot.  2nd time we had balcony seats. This is when we started to wise up, felt old, & no longer wished to be crushed against the railing. Seats were great up in the balcony. Sound was awesome, bar & bathroom upstairs, what more can you ask for.   3rd time involved GA tickets again. This time we just chilled by the bar for the entire show. Bartenders are super attentive & friendly. Even spilled 1 drink on the bar cuz I got distracted & the dude just poured another without giving me any attitude.    I will gladly travel to HOB Vegas to see a show anytime. On the plus side, Vegas crowds aren't pretentious like LA crowds. They actually get into the bands playing & aren't on their cell phones the entire show."}
{"text":"I usually go to HOB in LA and Anaheim but I like the Vegas location best.  Saw Phil Vasser because the pharmaceutical company sponsored the evening and rented the whole place out for our convention group.  The seating is great and the service is good. Small venue with good sound!"}
{"text":"Please don't come to this place! We did not get to try our meal and we walked out of it! Rude hostesses, very bad attitude. Said we had to wait for a table when the place was empty.  Then one of them walked us to our table which was a very small two-top.  We asked to ne moved to one of many empty (and some of them dirty) four-tops next to ours and she rudely declined saying that there was a waiting list for those tables when clearly there was none!! Really?? Bottom line terrible hostesses!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour in Vegas on a weekend...Say what?? My friend & I ventured in to good music playing, cheap stiff drinks and food specials. Great way to unwind after walking the strip!  Plus service was great & entertaining."}
{"text":"Good food. Good Service. Great live music--gratuity paid for live music."}
{"text":"Great place for concerts. Acoustics and sight lines are great except for the two big pillars. Have yet to have a disappointing time there due to the venue but the band thats another story. Its slow going when you try to get out like the Pearl going up those stairs.  Edit: Whats up with the stupid VIP section? it takes up the entire middle level between the bars behind the sound board? So the rest of us who don't want to be in the mosh pit have a bad view on the side lines!!!"}
{"text":"Service was poor, ribs were dry. Kept having to ask them to refill my water. Table was cleaned and we waited forever for check. Waitress just kept walking past saying I'll be right with you."}
{"text":"I recently held my bachlorette party at House of Blues and had a good time!!!   This House of Blues is located inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and has live entertainment at night (which keep in mind... they charge a 10% entertainment fee to your bill if you happen to be eating dinner while the music starts.)   We got a great table in one of their back rooms that sat my 20 girl bachlorette party. The service was fast and attentive. The atmosphere was relaxed and decor was cool. The only thing that disappointed me was the food... it was overpriced and was not really tasty.   All in all it was a good experience, mainly because of the company at my table.   I probably won't be back because nothing really struck me as awesome."}
{"text":"Went here to see Billy Idol this weekend, while Billy Idol himself was great, the acoustics in this venue are terrible! I've seen Billy Idol before and he his voice has only gotten better with age, but at House of Blues most of what we heard was the background music. Perhaps his mic was turned too low? Even when he addressed the crowd and spoke directly into the mic (with no music on), the sound was muffled and I couldn't understand what he was saying. Very disappointed in the poor sound in this venue.   We had standing tickets and that was great and we had a great view of the stage, but I don't think I'd return to this venue unless I really wanted to see the artist, as was the case with Billy Idol."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with music rocking round the clock. Took the kids and my sitter there for lunch. I enjoyed a shrimp ceaser salad and their signature corn bread with maple butter, yum yum! My kids both had Chef salads and their portions were very large and great for little fingers. The service was great, no complaints there. They got us a quite corner with view of the restaurant the casino so lots to look at while enjoying some good food."}
{"text":"This is a review of HOB Vegas as a concert venue. The food, I've had before and no offense but I'd seriously pass on it...  We saw AFI here this last January. AFI is one of my favorite bands, but more like a 90's version of them and not like the current circa 2000's December underground version.   As for the venue, this place kinda rocks. It is stadium seating so no problem getting a good view. I feel like it was general admission (pretty sure) but we had no problem getting really good seats. No problem getting in and out of the venue. Even with a long line it moved pretty fast. Good sound overall for the one show we experienced here. Their bar service was really fast with no waits upstairs.  I prefer this HOB over Anaheim any day. Plus the \"disneyland\" you deal with in Vegas is a lot cooler than the real one. And you don't have to deal with soccer mom's trying to run you over with their strollers..."}
{"text":"Good casual place with great ambience. Located at The Mandalay Bay and nice casual place for dinner before catching a show at Blue Man Group at the Luxor. Grilled Mahi Mahi tacos are good; however, corn tortillas tasted a bit dry and stale. Not worth the calories do ate the filling and the beans. Oh yum! The beans were soooo good!"}
{"text":"You know you're in Vegas when you shell out $25 for a hamburger and coke.   I tried this place a couple of times as we were staying in the Mandalay Bay and there are limited options. Food was OK, nothing really write home about. Service was good, no complaints. Pricing is pretty high, but then again, you are in a Las Vegas casino..  Not bad but far from great."}
{"text":"This by far was the worst restaurant we visited while in Vegas. Would recommend it to no one and will never return again. There were 4 adults and 1 teenager. After being seated we Had to wait for a glass of water. Once our order was finally taken we waited over 35 minutes for our dinner. Never once did our server come to our table to see if we needed anything or to tell us how much longer it would be before we receive our food. Instead, she stood in back of restaurant chit-chatting with other servers. Very poor service and food was not that great either."}
{"text":"This review is for customer service, or in this case lack there of. I went on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 with family visiting from out of town. Our waitress Britney was not rude but she also was not very attentive either. This place keep in mind at this time was NOT busy. After she took our orders she disappeared for what seemed forever, and that is how long we waited for our food. When she finally did appear she not once told us how much longer our wait for our good was, she just asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, which at this point after waiting for over half an hour for our food, of course we did. I then saw her standing over to the side after about another 15 minutes of waiting for our food, talking to three other workers, again, no apology for slow service, no mention of when our hood was coming. Finally, some guy who had the personality of a dish mop brought our food out. He was less then enthused to serve us. Food was decent, nothing to write home about. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to go to the Sunday Gospel Brunch on July 23 2017 with some family members....the singers were amazing and very entertaining. The host was very engaging with the audience which made it even more enjoyable.  The food was just ok nothing to rave about. The staff was very accommodating to some disability issues that we had and really attentive to out needs. I would strongly encourage everyone to not past up the chance to see it"}
{"text":"Great food if you can survive the wait to receive it after you order. Over 50 minutes from the time of ordering to the time of receiving our food."}
{"text":"I'd come back again. Happy hour was legit and the bartender was sincere. To be honest everything tasted standard. Chips and dip tastes like chips and dip. Street tacos tasted like street tacos. Well seasoned and good spices. Would I eat here again? Yes. I'd have to order 2 meals though... one for me and one for the guy with the gun pointed to my head.  Jk"}
{"text":"Attended with my partner last night, who had a stroke 3 weeks ago. Our first outing as he was learning to speak again. Spoke with concierge prior to show and informed her that we had 4 tickets. I invited the only people I trusted to be patient with him on his first social outing. Obviously he can't stand for 3 hours, so I inquired about seating and explained we will not be partying that night (obviously) and asked if we could bypass the VIP upgrade ($200) to get chairs since he can't stand.  Informed her that we are not jerks trying to \"get something for nothing\",  that whenever their house needs the floor filled that I, as Community School Ambassador to Clark County School District, distribute tickets to teachers. Rudeness of the \"manager\" was beyond anything I've experienced before. This was already a stressful situation as he was embarrassed not being able to advocate for himself and I was embarrassed in front of my friends who I assured would have a seat based on the info I was given. Finally, when the show was almost at intermission, I spoke with a girl by the VIP stand and asked, \"How much do I have to pay for a chair? $20? $200?\" There were EMPTY chairs all around. Finally we received a chair so my partner could practice communication and social norms again, instead of all of us standing behind him like bodyguards.You were insensitive, callous, and made a reasonable request seem like I was asking for a free round of drinks. All I asked for was a chair. Yea, your \"rule\" may be that you only sit the ADA customer and one companion, but do you have humanity and compassion? Do you only live in the world of black and white? There were empty chairs all around! I will never fill one of those chairs again. I will never distribute info regarding \"free tickets to CCSD teachers\" again. You embarrassed me, our guests who were to help with my partner's recovery, but most importantly my partner...who is a music lover and legendary blogger/distributor/fan."}
{"text":"Great venue - great staff - great acts - watch their concert listings - got see Deep Purple, Tesla, Shinedown, Slash and of course Steel Panther."}
{"text":"There's a lot not to hate here, but not enough for more than two stars. As a concert venue, it's decent and intimate (my old ass likes it up in the balcony). The booze and beer prices are pretty fair for a captive audience. Only real complaint: WTF with the bathroom attendants??  I've been to private events here, and the spaces I've experienced are not that great. As for food, it's maybe a notch above the McCasual level of a sit-down chain. Mediocre is about the highest praise I can muster."}
{"text":"We had just checked into the Mandalay Bay and decided to get some breakfast. We stopped by the House of Blues. It wasn't very crowded. We were sat right away. It took forever to get a drink order started. Our waiter was running around every which way but loose from table to table, but again it wasn't that crowded.   We finally ordered, I got the steak and eggs. I ordered the steak medium but received it a very much well done. It was super thin anyway and nothing special. We also got chicken and waffles which were ok, the pancakes and bacon were probably the best thing on the table. I had told the waiter we were celebrating my daughters birthday. When the meal was over he brought the check and said they didn't have any ice cream or anything else to bring out, but if we came back in a half an hour he'd take care of us. Seriously??   I wasn't impressed for the $100 plus we spent on this breakfast. Nothing really special here with average food. Go to the cafe at Mandalay Bay for breakfast, it's much better."}
{"text":"Solid offering for lunch and easy to find in the Mandalay where we had a convention. I had a  Naw'leans meal by starting with gumbo and then jambalaya for the entre. It was good though I expected it to be spicier. I have never been to any other H of Bs but I may try others."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never dined at the House of Blues. Since there was one located at the Mandalay Bay & we were guests we decided to have something to eat.  I ordered an omelet & mimosa & hubby had a burger. Both items were good, nothing special & our waitress was nice but a little slow service for the restaurant not being that busy.  Would like to come back for their gospel brunch or live show since it does have a good vibe."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and get out of the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  I think I am over the casinos and welcomed something a bit different."}
{"text":"I love House of Blues, I've been to many concerts here and I always have a great time and the music sounds great. I also wound up here on St Patrick's Day in Cleveland, don't really know how but it was really crowded and pretty fun then too. I don't really know why anyone would come here besides to go to a concert, but that's your own choice. I really like that the venue is relatively small but it's not so small that there's no room for anyone. Of course everyone tries to push their way up to the front but I like standing up a little farther aganist the railing.. no one is in your way and no one is really pushing you. Trust me, stand there if you go to a concert here.  Not much else to say, this is a good concert venue, that's about it."}
{"text":"best place in las vegas to see a concert. small venue, you can see everything on that stage. its especially really nice when the cute singers take their pants off and sing. its like you brought binoculars its so cozy."}
{"text":"Family of 4 and we all ordered different item and ending up with testing others breakfasts.  Breakfast special, pancakes, waffle were very nice.  Server was efficient and friendly.  Thank you Blade."}
{"text":"Bought tickets to see Santana and as a venue it was amazing. The show was fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed watching shows here. It's nice and small, so you're pretty close to the performers even if you're in the back. Of course, I'm talking about the general admission floor area. I'm not really sure why anyone would pay extra to sit up top.  Ticket prices don't seem to be as cheap as they used to be. I remember paying $20 to see Foo Fighters a decade ago. I also saw Redman and Method Man for about $20 and I bought Killers tickets for my brother for $20 a pop. Last week, I paid $45 to see Wu-Tang Clan. Still, I like the venue. It may be on the strip, but Mandalay's parking is easily accessible from the freeway.  On the restaurant side of things, I've eaten here a couple of times, but quite a long time ago. I remember having the Jambalaya and I still think that was one of the best I've ever had. I'm not an expert by any stretch. For some reason, whenever I see Jambalaya or Paella or Risotto on a menu, I have to try it. In fact, I saw a restaurant.com coupon for this place yesterday. I may need to return to try that Jambalaya again."}
{"text":"It's the H.O.B. and it's Vegas. Pretty meh for food, but that's what you get for going to a chain. Was staying in Mandalay so it was an easy open option during a conference that was full of people. Not sure I'd make a special trip to come back, but it was a decent dinner."}
{"text":"alright, so I came here for dinner 'cause it was fast (but not fast food), didn't require a reservation, and didn't require the spending of an arm and a leg for some famous chef's Vegas outpost that has never actually been visited by said chef.  (Besides, most of them are from SF, anyway, so it's not like I can't get it at home!)  Dinner was passable -- it's chain food, and it served its purpose.  The rosemary cornbread is yummy.  The ribs are pretty good (but I'm not a connoisseur), and the fried chicken was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.  Beers are only available by the bottle, oddly enough.  Dinner for the two of us cost about the same that it would have to go to a buffet, and at least the food was freshly made for us, so you can't beat that."}
{"text":"So we went for Fat Tuesday all you can eat crawfish, shrimp and beignets.  I was so disappointed.  It took long for everything to come out as if they weren't prepared for the crowd and the turn out wasn't that bad maybe 50 ppl.  The crawfish was dry and not well seasoned.  Idk if it's the first time that they did this but I've never had any issues eating at HOB and it won't stop me from coming back.  I actually enjoy their menu.  So even though i want to give 2 stars for this particular event I can't give it for my overall experience at HOB!   Paul was my bartender he was pretty good.  We didn't have mixed drinks just some beers but he made sure we never went dry.    The bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"We visited here a couple of times on our trip, once for breakfast and once for lunch.  My husband seemed to like it here on his last trip.  The food was good.  I would say that breakfast was better than the lunch, but then I'm a breakfast person.  There was plenty of food for each meal also.  The staff was helpful, and when we had a mistake on our bill, they fixed it right up.  Typical décor for a House of Blues, and it may be fun to try one of their evening concerts sometime."}
{"text":"We always have the BEST breakfast at House of Blues!!! Our server today \"ANGEL\" was amazing and a absolute delight!!! Thanks for the great attitude and service Angel :)  keep Rockin!"}
{"text":"Life and yelping it can be amusing. For example, take my experience with House of Blues (abbreviated HOB). Up to August 2016, I never set foot in one. That changed a couple of weeks past when I saw the Go-Gos in the Boston HOB. So, naturally I reviewed it. Then Yelper Debbie. N has free tix for anybody that wants to see Bee Gees Gold. Because I am a Bee Gees fan, I was like, \"Oh hell yeah!\" Thanks to Debbie. N, a few days later I would be in the Las Vegas HOB. The most amusing thing is that for the first time ever, I would be writing back to back reviews on a chain.     HOB is a chain of music venues. It was established at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1992. Two years later, this one opened in February, 1994. This was the Las Vegas version of the music venue in Boston. Both HOBs have the similar setup with the general admission standing only floor, three bars along the U-shaped perimeter, and two balconies. Regardless there were also differences between the two that they weren't cookie cutter.     Although life can be amusing, waiting in line at a HOB doesn't fall into this category. There is a need for a sign pointing to the line. We had to ask the restaurant hostess where it is. Then there is another line that seems to be for hotel guests. It seemed that they were nearer the door to get in first. Our line got through the security checkpoint first. Then there is another delay by the door. Then the security dude says that there is no line and everyone goes downstairs. Fortunately aggression was nonexistent.      The tix stated the doors open at 7. What time does the show start? Apparently 2 hours later. There was a warm up band that played for around a half hour and the rest was time anticipating the show.      The 2 hours wait, in my opinion is a money maker for the HOB to maximize $. The same for using standing room only that gives the perception of overselling tickets.      HOB was alive! Music fans of all ages from the Millennial couple to the silver haired grandma's were dancing & clapping away. HOB is upbeat and as far as mood goes it is the anti-blues.     On the general admission level, we hung out in the back corner. With the exception of a bench and small restaurant it was standing only. Normally every viewpoint would be intimate if it weren't for the 4 columns. One of them created a blind spot. The venue was packed creating my spot to be the prime real estate with elbow room. My HOB attitude is to enjoy the scene instead of fighting for the ultimate viewpoint.      The sound and lighting effects were spot on. The noise level was perfect. The sound was crisp giving the fans a detailed soundscape of the Bee Gees Gold harmonies. The strobe lights complimented the moods that the band tried to convey.      The HOB experience ends after the show with the sight of the pit littered with beer cups. Speaking of beer, there is the concern of people throwing beer off the balconies.      I never say never about returning to HOB. If that happens I will look into the means to get a table in the small restaurant overlooking the stage. The extra money on dinner and maybe a few cocktails would be worth it to sit down and enjoy live music in an intimate venue."}
{"text":"Was in the Foundation Room for a private party. An interesting, cozy space--not to say that it's small, but it has a nearly like-home feel with its fireplace and intimate seating. Balcony boasts a lovely view, though it was rather crowded and not quite so enjoyable when I was there. Looked like they had several smaller rooms as well, perhaps for intimate dinners and such. Drinks were fine, hors d'oeuvres and sweets were tasty, and service was absolutely excellent, generous and friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the last week. Breakfast is fine, but overpriced. If you get a 2 for 1 coupon from Mandalay Bay, it's worth eating there.  I also ate here during happy hour and it was better than expected. They had some special kind of rum on special so I had two mojitos and my boyfriend had 2 rum and cokes. With that we had an order of hot wings and a spicy shrimp dish w/ cornbread. Wings were SPICY and our drinks were perfect- our bill came to $21!! No complaints there!"}
{"text":"What can I say it's The House of Blues, if you've seen one you've seen them all. mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open. Good sound I have no complaints."}
{"text":"We just went to see Santana live at the HoB and it was fantastic! The venue is excellent for music and it's small enough to to make the concert intimate! We had a reserve table with a perfect view! The service was friendly and prompt! I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys great music in wonderful setting! Thanks for an fun evening!"}
{"text":"It's about as good as you would expect for a touristy chain but not even close o the caliber and quality of restaurants in the hotel. This is a bargain hunters spot and perfect if you're looking for a less than swanky spot to grab some grub.  The prices are actually normal here and the service is pretty good. I had the wing appetizer with a side of fries and they weren't bad."}
{"text":"Don't go to the House of Blues expecting a culinary experience to write home about.  Go there to have fun!  They are really are better at the whole rock and roll, get down, get funky thing.  I've had dinner here with hubby, we've seen Third Eye Blind play here (and we remember some of that experience) and we've gone to the Gospel Sunday Brunch.  One thing is for sure, we've had fun every time!  The Gospel Sunday Brunch was even more fun than we expected.  Stop by and let loose with whatever musical experience you choose to have while you're there.   Check out House of Blues at: http://www.hob.com/venues/clubvenues/lasvegas/"}
{"text":"So I really like coming here and have been here at least a hand-full of times.  I enjoy the live music nightly, the food, and the service has always been great; however every time I go it seems like the food takes forever to get out but that's not a major issue for a place like this though. House of Blues is a place to relax and not be in a rush so it doesn't bother me.  I am IN LOVE with their Portobello mushroom burger and I highly recommend it because it is delicious.  House of Blues is a good spot, especially on the strip for some tasty food and music vibes."}
{"text":"I went here to give it another shot, since my last experience was very lack-luster, and I must they this place reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly redeemed themselves!! So much so, that if I get the spot I had last night, I'd for sure drive the 3-4 hours to see more bands!! The staff were helpful and polite. I reallly had a great and amazing second time!! Thank you guys so much!!"}
{"text":"I visited the house of blues for a quick bite to eat and a drink with some friends. I ordered pig skin fries and pulled pork sliders. The food was awful. I thought I would get sick if I finished the food. The bartender was extremely rude. To top it off they charged my card 4 times. Horrible way to start my Las Vegas weekend. Never again. I would rate negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Harrison at the bar is the #1 House Of Blues employee... Yes!!! While dinning we just watched him work Non Stop!!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend really likes this place. I was rather so-so on it. Side note: we were just hanging out, not there to see a show.  It was a super nice weekend weather-wise and when it's like that, I'd honestly rather be outside. HOB was a little dark inside for my taste, considering the super bright day outside, but I digress. We did hit this place before a show (we were in town for MGMT) and got some food. My boyfriend ordered the steak salad, which was PHENOMENAL, and I had shrimp street tacos, which were SPICY AS F*CK - but rather delicious.  The bartenders were really the ones who made/saved the whole experience. We ended up back at HOB after the MGMT show and it was the same two ladies. They shared some really funny stories about things that have happened at HOB and, for one of them, stories of days as a roadie."}
{"text":"Came here for some special event for UNLV. It was some kind of contest setup for bartending. I guess it was sponsored by Sailor Jerry rum. There were a whole bunch of cutie rockabilly girls there showing off all their ink. The hubby was sad to have missed that! So I was to drink the 4 types of drinks they were pouring and pick my favorite. We could go up and get as many as we wanted which was nice. Its always fun to have an excuse to drink..it was a contest after all. They even had a nice foodie table set up with fruits/meats/cheese. So people had something in the ol' tummy before drinking themselves silly. For a free event it sure was fun!"}
{"text":"House of Blues:  (This review is for the restaurant only).   Where else do you go in a party of 14, on a Saturday night dinner with no reservations in the East 4th Area ?! House of Blues restaurant.  I admit, I had low expectations for this place, but the food was surprisingly ok . Overall, our server Kristie was really great and accomodating since some of our party arrived after we sat down and some of us changed seats at our table. The food was all right, in fact. The menu was generic, American Southern-Themed, but it was reasonably priced [$10-20 for entrees].  The Cornbread comes with Maple Butter (yum!) and was large enough to share it as a side for 2-3 people. The BBQ pork sandwich and sweet potato fries were all right. Cornbread + BBQ Pork sandwich + 20% tip for $18, not a bad way at all to start the night downtown.  Of course, if you haven't been to a House of Blues, don't expect it to have the 'blues' - the music was 90s [oasis and radiohead] and the only Blues things I saw/heard was a ceiling of 9*12inch busts with a brief bio.   The HOB restaurant was a pleasant surprise and a more casual place than the rest of East 4th, come on down."}
{"text":"We went here to see the Dan Band. As Vegas locals, we scored free tickets so that was awesome.  The place was really hot at first, almost as if the air condition wasn't on. Eventually it got a little cooler. We were in the standing room section so it was a little uncomfortable & crowded, but I guess that's expected. We ordered our drinks directly from the bar. They were well made drinks but very expensive!"}
{"text":"I do love the three sections of this place.  The restaurant (has the usual HOB food), the bar area/stage and the main concert hall.    A while back, they had \"Rock and Roll Karoeke\" where a house band would play live, while singers got up and sang their selected tunes.  It was excellent!    Have gone to a couple of concerts in the main concert hall and had a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Table of three ordered 3 crafts. Wanting to have a drink or two before ordering food. Was kicked out of our table for \"reservations\" on a Tuesday night due to the fact of not ordering food right away. Used to come here weekly. Will never be back. Go to greenhouse tavern, sawyer is awesome and will treat you great!"}
{"text":"The best experience!! Great food, thx u Chef Aaron Sanchez for a new menu!! Great service Suzie Q!!! Excellent personality! She'd be a great manager! We will try House of Blues in Anaheim next!! Super excited!!"}
{"text":"I just can't do enough shows here. Soon I'll be throwing bows at a Sunday Gospel Brunch, I swear. Saturday 08.01.08 was CAVALERA CONSPIRACY, basically Sepultura's core (Max and Igor) with a virtuoso lead guitarist and prog-mad bassist. Early on, security was a lot more active than I've ever seen them here, getting people in lock and dragging them out of the venue or giving them stern talking downs. Friends THROWDOWN, INCITE, DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, and BURY YOUR DEAD filled the rest of the evening with soothing discordance and calming carnage.   I came down with two friends (who, incidentally, were both hxc chixxx) and was proudly grinning like a Cheshire Cat when I saw how feral and aggro they were with the fools in the pit; kicking, shoving, head-butting and elbowing right up there with the best of em. The set was very Sepultura-heavy, and literally left me shell-shocked at the end. Stage lights already were up. Inventory: cheekbone, jaw and neck already knotting from The Hits. Pockets beat up from the overpriced (albeit strong) drinks. Gotta be careful and stealthy when popping idiots. As previous reviewers have mentioned, security is on point here and you will get kicked. Dazed and contused. Fun!"}
{"text":"I've seen multiple concerts here and I do have to say this is not a bad small venue to see a show. My only complaint is that quite a few shows have not had the greatest sound. It seems hard to hear the vocals clearly at times. They do have some killer drinks at the bar, definitely try the Mardi Gras punch."}
{"text":"Waiting in line then employee yells there is no line....free for all ensues and people behind rush to front! Then have thumb 3 sets of stairs and then go down a flight! With a bad knee this is NOT GOOD!!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS VENUE!!!!"}
{"text":"My family came here to see Carlos Santana the other night and what a show it was!  After security, don't try to bring your mase or anything with you, you head past the souvenirs and on to snap a pic in front of the billboard, then head inside. You have to go down stairs, to go back up if you're sitting in section 200 or 300. General admission and VIP were both downstairs, but let me tell you, the venue is so intimate, there is not a bad seat in the house. We were in section 204, last row and we could see everything perfectly. I didn't have to squint or guess who was where. The acoustics in there are awesome! I literally felt like I was on stage with them. There were bars on each side of the sections, as well as downstairs if you gotta get your cocktail on.   The decor of the place is pretty awesome as well. With many older artists pictures hanging on the wall, you definitely get a blues feel.   If you have not seen Santana, I encourage you to go. The venue is the right spot for his show. Like I said, there is not a bad seat in the house!"}
{"text":"I saw Joe Satriani here and the sound was decent but the venue needs to be updated badly. It's just too beaten up compared to The Joint. They seem to have an identity crisis, hosting a lot of crappy hip hop shows and trying to appeal to the wrong crowds. Steel Panther is a fucking joke yet they have a residency here on a regular basis. There are too many good local bands for this venue to support the garbage it's promoting as \"good music\" That being said, when a real band is actually booked here, the production values i.e. lights and sound are usually top notch."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday night dinner. It wasn't packed which was great.  There was a live band playing good music.  I ad the catch of the day which happened to be swordfish.  It was very good- well seasoned & moist.  It came with bacon mashed potatoes & sauted veggies.  The place was clean & sercice was good."}
{"text":"The short: Started with a concert and ended with dinner  The long: Went and watched a concert in the venue. One thing that was great and I would advise anyone to do is see if there is the option to pay extra and skip the line especially if you want to get up close. Not only do you get that bonus, but you can then take that money and have it applied to your tab in the restaurant. The venue was almost perfect for the show. The only thing I wish they would have done was have an option for seating in every show. I had a knee surgery and had to stand on the floor in the crowd on that stitched up post surgical knee. I even showed them my giant full leg knee brace and asked if there was a way I could pay extra for a seat and was told no. So needless to say I was in a lot of pain through the show. Once out of the concert we jumped into the restaurant which was pretty full but luckily I thought to make reservations ahead of time. We were seated and waited a good amount of time before I finally flagged down a server for ordering. Apparently the server who was working my area had gone home for the night and they had mistakenly put me in a \"closed\" section. There was a live cover band finishing up in stage who had their volume WAY too loud. Even ordering required screaming at the top of my lungs. Food took a long time to get out and when it finally did it was lukewarm at best. The flavors were all there it just look bad and the temp issue. All in all I wouldn't go back for food (maybe use my skip the line on booze) but would for a concert.  What works: Awesome venue for concerts and not a single bad seat in the house  What to improve: Service and improving food standards"}
{"text":"http://www.hob.com/venues/clubvenues/lasvegas/dining.asp Not only has blues concerts at night but the cajun creole food is  great.  Ribs , steak, chicken, jambalaya, gumbo and fried catfish.  I loved the sides like mashed sweet potatoes and rosemary cornbread.  Pricey.  The inside is dark with voodoo and bayou vibe to it."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to a few concerts here....One thing I don't like. Grey Goose Rocks....12 dollars. Yea....plastic ware and Vodka...eh....Just put me in the backyard of Jorge Lugo's house - have his mom make tamales, and kool aid in the plastic container. Yea that is just not classy. One thing that sucks...it's downstairs. So if you don't take the elevator. People are bottlenecked and herded in. 2nd sucky thing. Kids are smelly....Boys especially. So going to a rock concert. gross...smelly....sweaty...boys...who think they're hard core and they like to mosh. One thing about me....I'm a tank. Myke Smash. Yea I rock out. But I would rather you not smash your face onto my fist. It's just weird. Overall - it's ok - I've been here when it was great. But I've been to some hot smelly crappy concerts here too. I gotta knock it for drink prices and presentation. I also knock it for having cheap concerts that attract hooligans and hoodrats with their shenanigans....Whoa...that's the whitest I've sounded all day...."}
{"text":"Come here ONLY FOR THE HAPPY HOUR!!   The food is reminiscent of high school cafeteria food but the HAPPY HOUR IS SUCH A good deal, it's worth it.... but only for happy hour!!  I think like 4 of us had drinks and food for like 35 dolla!!  Remember, this isn't mortons, and only order appetizers and beers and mixed drinks during happy hour and let the vegas dream live on beootches!"}
{"text":"Came by the lounge late night for a private party only to see that most of the party already left... There was no cover and the view from the top is amazing!  ...other than that, the place was dead...super dead."}
{"text":"Great concert venue. Was there to see otherwise last night and the sound and lighting and special effects are wonderful. The drinks are just so fucking expensive! UGH and the women's restroom is always a line! Annoying. Also the bathroom people freak me out."}
{"text":"I'm docking a star only because my group of 18 had to use a limited group menu with our dining reservation and couldn't order off of the full menu. Not all restaurants in Mandalay Bay & Luxor had that restriction, but in a time crunch on our group's first night, and looking for convenience as well as a fun experience, we decided to try HOB anyway. The available options were good, but several of my people complained that they had wanted something from the full menu. I also fielded complaints that our table was too close to the stage & therefore chatting while dining was impossible. I guess you can't please everyone.  Apparently we were able to order anything from the bar, although I chose the Hound Dog Mule from the drink menu. At $17, I expected a larger than typical beverage; however, after I received my small cocktail & re-read the menu, I realized that my drink came in copper HOB cup that I could keep. As a graphic designer, I felt misled by the asterisk & it's 8pt italicized disclaimer; it seemed like HOB was trying to hide that the cocktail alone was $12. This is truly a shame, because how many Vegas souvenirs can you get for $5?! Why isn't House of Blues making a bigger deal about this fun extra? I think they're missing out on big upsells, while I still feel misled by the cocktail menu. And, yeah, this also contributed to my less-than-5-star rating.  Our server was outstanding, and the kitchen was on the ball this night. My steak was perfect, and I heard of zero food  complaints from any of my team. Our appetizers were amazing as well. House of Blues served a great dinner to our group, and I will most likely include them in my meal considerations for our 2020 convention."}
{"text":"HOB located right smack dab in the middle of Mandalay Bay had a great atmosphere and the food was pretty good. We ate breakfast there and we left pretty full and happy. Our server was very sweet.  My friends and I had a really good time shopping in the little gift shop-really cool items!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced but I love everything else about this place. The bartender Molly remembers my drink and is fast and very friendly. Great place to catch happy hour."}
{"text":"I really like the venue. Drinks are super expensive, which is probably consistent with everywhere else I suppose. I've been here for a few special events (like year end parties for work). The food is great and service/security is top notch."}
{"text":"This venue is horrible. They cram way too many people in. We were finally approached since we were standing in the stairs and asked if we would like to go upstairs and sit. For what is supposed to be a bar setup the drink process are extremely high."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by \"Happy  hour\". I ordered the chicken strips for $6 and it consisted of 3 small, bland strips and a small portion of fries. I then ordered the quesadillas which were very shabby and flat..."}
{"text":"This review is for the Steel Panther concert. They were amazing and deserve 7 stars! The venue was nice but after a long day of travel being able to take a seat would have been nice. There were supposed to be two bands before Steel Panther but one must have bailed or canceled because there was an hour long gap of nothing between the opener band and Steel Panther. Since we weren't drinking and were standing next to a couple guys with boundary issues (get out of my bubble dude!) it was a long two hours before Steel Panther came on. They were awesome, great entertainers and there was even an awesome chick fight between a couple of the girls they brought on stage, they literally pulled each others clothes off and threw slugs, pure entertainment! I would have given this place 5 stars if there had been access to any chairs that weren't VIP."}
{"text":"So disappointed in House of Blues!  Traveled to Vegas from Houston on 23 May for the express purpose of seeing Carlos Santana.  This was a \"bucket list\" experience for us so we went all out, spending $222 each for seats advertised as \"VIP,\" with the \"...second best view\" in the entire venue.  We were not given specific seats at the time of purchase; rather, the seats were to be assigned to us by the box office.  Unfortunately, when we were taken to our seats, we found that the view was obstructed and we could not see Santana and three of his band members for much of the concert. I feel that if a venue is going to provide obstructed view seats, they should be advertised as such so consumers can make an informed decision. We sent House of Blues a letter and also provided feedback on their website, but have received no response. Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"(I'm reviewing the Sunday gospel brunch at the House of Blues, not the performance venue.) When my sister in law first suggested having brunch here I was skeptical. I didn't think a performance venue would have particularly good food, but I was wrong. The Sunday brunch serves all southern style food-- biscuits and gravy, jambalaya, corn bread-- everything yummy and deliciously fattening. I love how you eat at long picnic style tables. By the time the gospel show started I was too stuff to sit there and enjoy, but the crowd really got going and participated in all of the \"Amen!\" and \"Feel the Lord!\" It was fun and a different way to enjoy brunch in Vegas."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but on this trip to Vegas and two meals at THOB I must say I was very disappointed in the food. It was one notch above terrible for me. The BBQ wings were small, hard and the sauce tasted like ketchup. I needed tabasco sauce to give them flavor.  I came back the next day for Gospel Brunch with Kirk Franklin. It was a buffet style breakfast with live music. I thought having brunch and getting to see Kirk Franklin would be worth the 107.00 we paid for tickets. Well I was wrong. The food for the most part was again terrible. Maybe it was ok for a food cart vendor but for THOB it was extremely underwhelming.  I had the blackened catfish that was so salty you could not eat it. It was so bad that the food that contacted it became inedible. Well at least we were going to get to see Kirk Franklin. Wrong again. We got to see a movie clip of him and he didn't even sing!! WTF?! 107.00 dollars for bad food and a movie. I felt robbed. Huge disappointment.    The little gospel quire that I thought was opening was good."}
{"text":"Went here for the Drake concert and it was packed. I wished they opened the doors earlier for the concert but the concert started on time. The prices for the Drake concert was overpriced though but I guess the venue sets the price based on popularity of the the performer as well as the costs for security and all of that. Overall, great concert experience (also Lebron James was on stage but if I factored that in, I would give this place a five star as well as the concert)."}
{"text":"I had the Juicy Lucy and my wife and kid had the \"build your own\" (don't remember what they got on it) but did rave about it.  The ambiance was a little Pink Taco'ish but none the less very cool.  Maybe half the tables were full so they weren't that busy but our service sucked and we actually had to go to the bar to get refills on our waters and soda.  I sarcastically, on the second trip mentioned to the bar tender that it was nice of them to let the customers fend for themselves.  Will be back but sit at the bar since that's where you get the best service apparently."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! They overbooked a show and did not open the upstairs balcony and herded everyone downstairs my wife slipped down the wet stairs and hurt her knee they didn't want to accommodate her until we made a fuss. Just the worst. Too bad because the venue itself is great their staff just sucks. Herd people in like cattle. Will NEVER go to another show here again. Pissed I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the sound system the first night of Billy Idol on his May residency.. MAY 4th.  It cut out at least a dozen times during the performance,  and made for a disconcerting concert.  If I were Billy Idol I'd be hopping mad!   I can't believe no one from the venue tried to fix it"}
{"text":"Not much to say just stopped in for some drinks. A little disappointed in the selection of Scotch and Bourbons.   Surprised that there was no \"Blues\" music being played over the in house stereo. What is the name of this place? I know were were not here during a show, but really to listed to \"pop\" music at the hose of Blues."}
{"text":"We tried out the new menu at House of Blues on Friday night. We had the street tacos. They were good but nothing special for $11.   Also tried the jalapeño turkey burger and the mushroom manchego burger. The best part of the burger was actually the bun!!  Fococcia I do believe.   Be warned that there is a live entertainment tax added to your bill automatically!!  We talked to our server and got it removed because we never heard a live note played :)  All in all, pretty good. We just eat there because it's close to where we are going for the evening!"}
{"text":"The concert venue is an amazing place to see any type of performance, but the restaurant is the opposite. The food is totally sub par and very over priced, as are the drinks at the bar. Oh and if you happen to be there on happy hour, you can only get those prices of you are seated at the bar. They used to allow a pass the line for shows if you eat or drink and spend $20 total, not so anymore. It's $20 a person to not stand outside in the Cleveland weather. For that price I'd rather go down the street and pay for better food, drinks, and service. I feel that this place knows its floundering so they jack the prices to its restaurant but do not give the customers what they pay for."}
{"text":"So so fun! There was a stage in the middle of the restaurant with a live band! It was so awesome!  The service was super great too - food came out so quickly, I didn't have time to change my mind.  Change my mind, you say? Yes. I'm on this health kick and being in Vegas has been tough, but I'm doing it. So I decided to splurge a bit and get the shrimp with grits - thank god I checked the recipe online! I entered it in myfitnesspal and found out 1 serving was over 1,500 calories!!! Absolute freak out! So I ended up tasting the grids and only eating the shrimp - still got the taste of the delicious sauce, but left 90% of the cream and grits on my plate.  Let me tell you it was absolutely amazingly delicious!  My hubby got the buffalo chicken salad which was very good as well.  This was such a fun night!! Absolutely loved it. Gave me a little taste of New Orleans, which I miss greatly."}
{"text":"The ambiance is pretty chill. I went for a Yo Gotti show and was a little disappointed in the size of the venue. There were at least three people I did not know touching me at all times. The good thing about that was, I got passed a blunt by a stranger. The venue was extremely crowded, the tickets don't cost that much, and I had a really good time."}
{"text":"We had Jennifer as our server (4/11/17) Mandalay location, she was top-notch. We ate dinner and are coming back for breakfast tomorrow. She made the experience for my family."}
{"text":"I have only been to house of blues for concerts, not to eat here (no vegan options!).    The venue is OK, I think it's decent for concerts, it's small, has a General admission and seating section.  Full Bar down stairs and decent bathrooms.  The staff has always been decent when I have been there.    The drink prices are about as good as you would expect, especially for vegas.  Not sure what else people expect to find.  My suggestion is to hit up the bar across from HOB and get a huge freezy drink for $9 with an extra shot.  It will save you money (unless you want water).  I would come back here again, and I love Mandalay Bay too!"}
{"text":"We decided that since we were hitting a concert at HOB, we might as well eat there. We were pleasantly surprised. Our food was quite good and the service was stellar. (Our server, Tyler, was exceptional.) We highly recommend HOB's meatloaf..."}
{"text":"The House of Blues is my favorite music venue in Cleveland! The entire venue is filled with all kinds of African influenced art that gives it such a cool vibe. The staff is extremely professional and very helpful. I've seen some of the best shows of my life here, and can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by the presentation especially with it resting in the Mandalay Bay. To me it looked just like Friday's and I've never been to a house of Blues before but I'm sure it's not supposed to make you feel like you're eating at TGI Friday's. They have the strangest decor I've ever seen; painted crosses covered with bottle caps and paintings of disfigured people on the walls.  They had s decent happy hour going, $5 well drinks and $3 beers. We ordered 3 appetizers that came with the happy hour deal, nachos and cheese, hot wings and chicken tenders while we sat ate the bar drinking our beers. I grabbed me a Blue Moon to go and stuffed it in my purse."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food - so this review is really of the bar and happy hour specials.    Came by about 30 minutes before the end of happy hour after a couple of hours gambling in the casino - happy I did as it's much cheaper to spend $3 on beers than lose $100 for a \"free\" one out in the casino ;)   There is a great selection of beers in bottles and the bartender is VERY generous with the pours of liquor.    The bar was filled with \"cougars\" who kept hitting on my friend - very funny.  Clientele seemed to be a bit older than I usually see in bars I frequent, around 40-60 years old was the average age."}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN REVIEW:   Happy to find a somewhat affordable place in Mandalay Bay.  We really didn't want to spend $30+pp on a gut busting meal after a long day of travel and being a little before 10pm and wanting a decent veggie option it was tough to find something that fit the bill.  The breakdown: *Ambiance: cool decor, good music: 4 stars *Staff: pleasant, helpful: 4 stars *Food:    ---Fiancé got Fried Chicken with potatoes and veggies, said it was flavorful/tender but greasy $17.99: 3 stars,       ---I'm a vegetarian so I got the child's mac and cheese plus a side of veggies, that mac was yummy! $6.99+$3.99 (not bad for a Mandalay restaurant and just the right amount): 4 stars  All in all, we were happy to have found it and if we find ourselves in a similar predicament again we may go- otherwise we'll hop across the strip to the In-n-Out."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere staff, and food were excellent!!! I would definitely have friends and family come at and enjoy!!! awesome sound and talent!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on memorial weekend. I knew it would be busy but the service was so slow in the bar. We snagged a dirty table and sat there for 10 mins before someone came to clean it. Another 5 before our waitress came over and asked us what we'd like to drink.They have a good beer selection. I really like Abita Purple Haze. We ordered BBQ wings to start. They were really good. For entrees we ordered fried chicken which was delicious! I should of swapped the cole slaw for Mac and cheese. We also ordered ribs. Don't order the ribs. They aren't soft they were rough. We only ate one rib. Wasted money. We asked for our check and the waitress was in a rush cleared our plates I guess didn't even notice the ribs weren't touched. You would think she'd ask about it and offer something else but we had been sitting there so long we paid and left."}
{"text":"First time at HOB and really liked this place. I came with my boyfriend for a concert and really like the venue. I would definitely come back for other events as it is a great spot from anywhere you are. Prices for tall boys were reasonable."}
{"text":"Waaaaay overpriced, pay a few more bucks and go to a top notch restaurant in MB. Or go cheap elsewhere.  The salmon special was incredible but the pasta were bland noodles in catsup. The service was amazing however (thanks Lisa) and saved the day. She had them make the sauce into a rose for me.   Overall a fun place like all HOB's but really steep for the budget traveler."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to see a concert, so long as I get orchestra level seats.  I'm not much of a fan of standing around in the packed general admission area getting shoved around and stepped on.  HOB is pretty small though, so even if you get a GA ticket, its not that bad.  Their drink prices are reasonable too considering it is a concert venue on the strip.  There is a private bar on the orchestra level and the stage can be scene from any position so it's not a huge hassle to get a refill while the show is going on.  I really like the fact that the security are so strict about people sneaking up to the second level if they don't have tickets for seat up there.  That way it never gets that crowded, even for a sold out show.   Another thing worth noting is the volume level never seems to be too loud or too soft, but just right.  Unlike shows I've scene elsewhere, I have never left a show here feeling like I'd lost 90% of my hearing for a week or so after.  Some of the shows I have attended at HOB include; Citizen Cope, Charlie Murphy, Everclear, Third Eye Blind, Dierks Bentley, She Wants Revenge, The Bravery.  They have all been great!"}
{"text":"whoa! i saw a \"people like me on yelp\" sticker on the door and i had to write a review!  i've gone to HOB just twice because i intentionally avoid it. the first show was one my favorite bands. the second show we got free tickets or else i wouldn't have gone.  ticket price is never just a ticket price. learned that the hard way when i went to the box office to avoid fees. NOPE. even a fee at the box office. so, it is literally *impossible* to not pay fees unless you have some type of buddy at the venue i guess.  ridiculous policies - like, someone had offered my boyfriend and i their reserved seat tickets. the attendant wouldn't allow me to go get the tickets (while he watched) from the people. they had to bring them to me. unfortunately, i didn't have their cell #s and they didn't magically know they had to bring them up. so, that was a pain and something you don't see at non-corporate venues.  HOB is a corporate chump and there are only a handful of bands i'd see if they played there. larger indie bands should play at the masonic temple. everyone else, there is the grog, beachland, etc! please no HOB!"}
{"text":"The hostess Claudia was awesome she explained everything to us on how it works how to use our coupons and where the different seating arrangements were we decided to sit in the happy hour section where they have the Booths we had an awesome bartender and the manager on duty was very thorough and informative on how to use are my Vegas comps. the food was great"}
{"text":"We have seen so many shows here. Steel Panther and The Dan Band just last week. We love the venue. We have mostly had standing seats (which are first come first serve). We have sat upstairs several times. We recently bought a table. Any spot in here is great. The staff at Will Call is awesome and hostess and waitresses rock. Always a clean venue. Restrooms always have an attendant. Drink prices are a bit pricey but not to bad for the strip. I always feel very safe inside. The security is top notch! The décor throughout is crazy cool. I love it. Highly recommend and will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"1 star only because the host and waitress were nice. Other than that do not eat here. We ordered buffalo wings that had a burnt bacon taste to it. My boyfriend got a philly cheese steak that was nothing great. Same with my turkey burger that had me throwing up all night and sick to my stomach for 2 days. Never again!"}
{"text":"Medium food, high prices, staff keeps the change."}
{"text":"Now, I have been to many a show at House of Blues. This venue is amazing for intimate shows and always good for a dance party. Recently, they have been advertising local specials on drinks. I am guessing this is to attract more local traffic as I am sure it has decreased with the opening of the Cosmo and they're great line-up of shows. We went to see Panic! at the Disco, whom we are all fans of. The show was great, but when we asked about the local drink specials, we were told by the bartender that he had no idea what we were talking about. Meanwhile on a television screen behind him, the advertisements were playing, We pointed this out to him and were told, \"Everyone pays the same price\". Hey House of Blues, if you want us to pay $10 for a tall boy of PBR, we will. Just don't tell us it'll be cheaper. BOOOOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Just very much fun.  There was _loads_ of great food throughout a southern-style buffet, carving station, salad and dessert bars, and a couple other areas I can't put a specific description on but that were just as stuffed with edible goodness.  There's free orange juice and water, and bloody mary's and mimosas as $4.25 [and the latter are excellent].  From the time the doors open, you get 30-45 minutes to eat and talk before the band and singers come on.  You can still eat during the performance, but it is hard to pull away -- the musicians are energized, full of life, and really get the crowd going.  I think I'd give this a 4.5 if I could.  But pretty much only because I like gospel _choirs_ even better than small gospel groups -- I just wanted to hear the place rock without the speakers blaring.  (Not that the sound was bad at all -- I'm just greedy!)  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was slow and I was shocked that they didn't serve any fish. The fish of the day was shirmp and spinich. Now how can they claim to be cajun and not serve any fried fish or have any crystals hot sauce?"}
{"text":"One of the best venues to see a rock show! Drinks are expensive, but there's not a bad seat in the house."}
{"text":"We love the House of Blues whether in NOLA, Orlando or LV. Just got back from out four day Super Bowl stay at Mandalay Bay and we ate at HOB three times. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious and the burgers are the best. The atmosphere is fantastic and cannot wait until out next trip."}
{"text":"I am biased; I witnessed one of the funniest scenes of my life here.  HOB was pleasantly surprising. I would never have thought they'd have such attentive servers and really delicious food. My dad's friends made the reservation, so I didn't have a say in any of the matter. The atmosphere is a bit chain-y, but it's pretty, and the bathroom is really big! Anyway, everybody liked their entree, and our server was so nice, dealing with our rowdy group. The band was a 90s rock group specializing in girl power songs like No Doubt and Alanis, and I loved it. The sound is great, too. After too many drinks, some poor girl decided to dance-attack my dad on the dance floor. She seemed lost from her friends. She wasn't wearing underwear....and I can't quite explain the scene when she tried doing back bends in her mini skirt, on my DAD. My mom watched in pure shock as the whole group completely lost it. Not sure if I've ever laughed that hard in my life. What happens in Vegas, goes on Yelp. The staff handled it very well. They were nice to the girl, but needless to say, she had to go auf wiedersehen. They escorted her out and we got a story to tell for years."}
{"text":"FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING! We purchased tickets for the Eli Young Band and were really looking forward to it. The ticket and website said \"Doors open at 8:00. Show starts at 9:00\"  This was a mid week show.  (we had to be at work as usual 7am the next morning).  We arrived about quarter to 9, purchased a small plastic cup of wine and can of beer overpriced at $22.00, and waited for the show. The opener was finishing. 9:00 came and went. At almost 20 minutes after 9:00 a band came out. NOT the Eli Young Band. When we asked they told us they wouldn't be starting until 11:00 or after!  This is completely misleading. After some argument, the Box Office refunded us. We would never have purchased tickets had they been truthful about the showtime. We have lost faith in the integrity of the House Of Blues and will never purchase tickets there again."}
{"text":"I came here as a guest of my program director. It wasn't bad. The jambalaya was tasty, but rather salty -- though that is sort of to be expected. The lobster mac and cheese was quite good! I enjoyed the ginger mango drink, but it was a little too sweet. I let the ice melt to water it down a little. The ambiance is very dark, so if you like that sort of thing, there's that. The service was excellent. We came for lunch, so there was no concert."}
{"text":"Went there to see a band, the staff was rude, told us we would have to buy 2 drinks per hour each, we don't drink, we saw no soda on the menu. We left without seeing the band.  It's just a very overpriced hole in the wall. Will never go there again for any reason"}
{"text":"I've been to HoB dozens of times, but nothing recently until a concert the other night.  The venue is small enough to make you feel close to all the action, but big enough to where it isn't overly crowded.  It is probably my most favorite place to listen to live music in town truthfully.  Most other places are much much larger, and you don't have the same effect being there.  The security here are actually decent people, not too harsh and stern like they were a few years ago.  Seems like they lessened up a bit.  Prices are usually reasonable too, but that obviously depends on who's playing."}
{"text":"I love coming to see shows at the House of Blues.  The security guards do their jobs without being jerks, and I never have a problem obtaining my photo passes when I'm working for bands."}
{"text":"This is for the Foundation Room which is on top of the Mandalay Bay.   The views are incredible, but not much to be seen if you're seated indoors.   The food is top notch! They seem to have a full kitchen on the same floor in order to produce this quality.   The service was a perfect mix of fun and approachable while still very professional.  The only complaint I have is the general air of exclusivity it has. I guess maybe in Vegas you need to be 'selective' in who you allow in, but they asked my friend to leave his camera behind. Meanwhile, the table next to us took video with their smart phones (loudly)."}
{"text":"Food is really quite bad, and drinks too--got a margarita with little more than sour mix... Disappointing, luckily didn't break the bank"}
{"text":"Not too long ago I had my first experience at this particular House of Blues, and it was definitely a great one! I went on a Tuesday night which happens to be when their  \"Swingin Tuesdays\" occurs. If you are a fan of swing, you should check it out! There are many talented swing dancers that turn up, and the live band is pretty good too!  On to the food! I decided to order their Lobster Mac & Cheese. If you are looking for pure ooey-gooey cheesy lobster BLISS, order this! The mac and cheese comes served hot and topped with crunchy panko breadcrumbs. If you have never tried panko breadcrumbs before, you are missing out. The light, crunchy texture provides a perfect coating for any dish. The cheese was very creamy and tasted great with the large, plentiful pieces of lobster they provided in the meal. If you can't tell by now, I was very satisfied.   For dessert, I ordered the triple chocolate cheesecake. In case you didn't read it right the first time, let me say it again.. TRIPLE. CHOCOLATE. CHEESECAKE. Anything with triple the amount of chocolate is amazing in my book. The cheesecake is served with raspberries and other seasonal berries to compliment the chocolatey goodness. The whipped cream was the added cherry on top to this perfect dessert. Definitely 10/10, would eat again."}
{"text":"Great venue, but usher has almost ruined our night.  I was not going to write a review but after thinking about it and seeing how another venue went above and beyond to a help my handicapped mother I decided I had to write this.  This past Saturday night my and I attended the Santana concert.  My mom had been using an electric scooter all of our trip be decided not to bring it as we had to take a can in the venue.  She walls with a cane and it is very clear that she has mobility issues. We are on the second level and took the elevator up.   We were greeted by an usher, he looked at our tickets and pointed the section out to is and said you are 2nd row.  We started the down the stairs and once we get to the to the 2nd row I see there are no empty seats.  I get my mom to stand on the stairs and hold on the railing while I go up to get assistance from the user.     The user has dancing when I asked for his help he said I told you 2nd row from the top, not the bottom.  In other words he saw that me and my handicapped mom were having problems and he decided just to dance.  We got to our seats, with out any assistance I shall add.  At the end of the concert we stand in lane to what we thought was the elevator, it was I fact the stairs.  Same usher standing right there says nothing.  One if the other guest tells is that's the line to stairs if we go straight and turn right we can get to the elevator. Your ushers may need a refresher in guest relations.  The next night we went to the Mirage to see Boys to Men.  Their ushers went above and beyond to help out my mother and we never asked for a thing from them."}
{"text":"*This review is for the will call ticket area and not for the restaurant*. On Saturday 5/6/17, my fiancé and I headed to the HOB for the Billy Idol concert (which was amazing).  I purchased the tickets from home 2 days prior to the concert and the only option I was given was will call. That's when I encountered the representative at the ticket window named Jason. I told him that I was there to retrieve my Billy Idol tickets. He asked for ID and then walked over with my tickets. I then went on to ask about the packages for the concerts. He looked at me with a bewildered look and said \"what do you mean?  What packages\". That really was aggravating. He works at the HOB and I'm pretty sure he hears the term packages quite often. He seemed to be playing dumb but knew exactly what I was talking about. I went on to tell him \"the Billy Idol packages. When I bought the tickets, I wasn't given the option of adding a meet and greet or dinner package when I was checking out. I read the HOB website that states packages could be added on the day of the event\". Then Jason says \"oh those packages.\"  He went on to say that people attending the Billy Idol concerts usually don't buy the packages so they aren't usually offered. He stated \"now for Santana, the packages are offered because people want them\". I said, well I'm only asking because the website said I could add it at checkout and I wasn't given the option. I get it.  If packages aren't offered or no longer available, not a problem. It's the way the message was delivered. His customer service skills were sub par and condescending. Customer service means everything in this day and age. If I'm going to dish out money, which I have no problem doing, I expect to be treated with courteous and friendly service. So overall, I don't really care to return to this venue. The concert was a 5 star show, but as I mentioned, this review was for the overall experience at the will call window."}
{"text":"We've been here many many many times and have always enjoyed it.  We came here last night with a group of friends to see the Dirty Hooks (local Vegas band) open for the Stone Temple Pilots.  The venue is awesome and we had a great time.    They off a lot of bars and plenty of area to watch the shows.  Great sound system and great bartenders."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with a group of 5. We were seated very quickly, however I could tell by the faces of the other guests they were not pleased with the service. Many of them looked as if they were waiting quite a while. The table next to us actually waived their bill in the air to be picked up by the waiter.   Once seated I decided to head to the bar for a drink based on the looks around us I wanted to get my drink quickly. The waiter was at the table when I came back and looked flustered that I ordered from the bar rather than him. We quickly ordered our food, we ordered the following.   Heat Seeker Burger- my friend said this was a pretty good burger. No complaints. Came with sweet potato fries and I tried those, pretty yummy!   Chicken sandwich- my other friend has this, yet another with no complaint. Came with sweet potato fries as well.   Buffalo Chicken sandwich- I had a few bites...the chicken was cold. I found this strange. Nothing to rave about just a regular salad with buffalo chicken on top.   Chicken tacos- pretty flavorful, small but I think they were street tacos so not bad.   Everything was just ok. Little bit of a wait to order and get drinks and the cold buffalo chicken was a bust. Definitely would go somewhere else when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Where do I start? My wife and I saw Billy Idol on the 18th of March. First off, don't waste your money on the loge seating unless you have seats directly facing the stage. The sound system sucks for lack of a better description. If you have seats near the stage In the loge seating the speakers are so loud to try and cover the damaged sound that you can't hear anything.  All you hear is the crackling speaker.  We had seats in loge 8 and our view was covered by a safety bar. Also anyone seated in the rows behind you will walk up to take video with their phone and security does nothing to stop them.  We ended up walking out before the show was over. I wouldn't even give the experience 1 star, but I was unable to leave a review."}
{"text":"We went to see Boogie nights as a guest of as close friend. Doors open at 8 but band did not start till 930. No seating available unless you want to pay 200 for a table with a 1 bottle minimum. Boogie nights is not exactly a chart topping band here. So my complaints with my not so young back. I enjoyed about 30 minutes of the show because my back hurt so bad I had to go to casino to sit down. While I was waiting for band to start I paid 13 dollars for a lukewarm 40oz Bud Light. Will not go here again. Maybe I am too old. However the lack of seating and drink prices were the only complaint I heard this night."}
{"text":"This place is such a treat. With so many pretentious places in Las Vegas, this place was such a breath of fresh air. I absolutely loved the comfort food and the comfortable vibes there. The music was dope also! I just can't say enough about how good of a whole experience this was. Good music, great food, good vibes."}
{"text":"Great experience. I was invited to listen to my very  talented friend perform that night. This is a very special place! It has an ambiance second to none. The food is outstanding and very unique, later that night a friend of my friend that has already preformed invited us to a private room in the back area to see Aretha Franklin standing room only! It was a magical night....very unforgetable."}
{"text":"I would like Thank Taylor and her Manager for the comp ticket last Friday the Biz Markie show"}
{"text":"Took my 90 year old mother this year for Mother's Day because last year when husband took me it was fairly decent. This most recent visit to the gospel brunch was not as enjoyable. The chicken fingers were dry.  They ran out of turkey at the carving station.  A lady dropped a serving spoon on the floor and than put it back on the saucer they had to put during serving. Food was lukewarm. The seating is horrible. When booking do not get a table to the right or left of the sound booth.  The tables and chairs sit low and you can't see over/around the booth. There is a railing that if you're sitting in seats 1 and 2 you can't see.   Railing is right at eye level.  You would have to stand and than the folks behind you wouldn't be able to see the show.  The seating chart looks like everything is the same level and of course they don't tell you when you buy the tickets.  I bought mine in person and both times I ended up by the damn sound booth. My bad. All the seating is close. Not much elbow room. Banquet table seating and you're not facing the stage. Need to turn your chair around to see stage.  Get there early to eat so you can turn your chair around to see show or eat with plate in your lap. After all this place is meant for standup concerts. The saving grace was that both times there was a two person high top table that our server allowed us to sit in.  That puts you up high enough to see over the sound booth. Fortunately my mom is a nimble 90 year old so I was able to get her up in the barstool.   Our server was very attentive removing plates and getting drink orders. Also this is \"new gospel\" so don't expect the \"old school\" back in the day or choir type show.  It also depends on the group. This recent trip was a more modern group.  Lead female singer was more traditional and very animated.  2015 visit was a different group with a lead male singer and a bit more traditional.   There is a lot of \"fluff\" during the show.  Meet and greet.  Birthday, anniversary, wedding and special occasion interaction.  They really only sing tops 8 songs."}
{"text":"From someone who grew up going to concerts, at a variety of venues, Cleveland us lucky to have a place like the House of Blues. Hosting eclectic artists, you can step outside of your comfort zone and go listen to someone new or the artist you have plastered all over your wall and look at each day. Just kidding, maybe you are not that intense, but either way, the House of Blues probably has an artist right up your alley.  From Galactic to the hometown boy, MGK, this venue hosts both an upper and lower deck area. You can typically see from every point, unless you are hanging out by one of the back bars, then you might be in for some bobbing and weaving to see the stage.  The sound system is pretty great for a smaller indoor venue. I highly suggest grabbing a bite to eat on East 4th or keep it close to home and go to the House of Blue's own restaurant. Typically, if you spend more than $20, you do not have to wait outside in line for your concert and will let you enter from the inside. Not to be a baby, but knowing Cleveland's weather, eating at the restaurant is your best bet during 9 of the 12 months.  Take a look at their artist lineup on the outside board of the venue or online. Typically you can find relatively decently prices tickets through Groupon or other accounts such as those."}
{"text":"First off I should really review this place as a concert venue first. Loved the show I went too and the sound was incredible. The bar service was good and speedy. But it is definitely a Vegas place. I really don't like to spend $14 dollars on a PBR tall boy? But that is what I had to do. In the end I would definitely come back here. But plan on not drinking while there."}
{"text":"This place just didn't do it for me. We ate at the restaurant...forgettable and went to a music venue. The venue was just small...most clubs are bigger than this."}
{"text":"This place is packed from the bottom to the top! The air conditioner should be turned to high for every concert.  I thought I was gonna pass out from all the body heat.  The drinks were good.  The 3 floor hike to the upstairs seating was just awful.   I heard every person complaining with each step..going up or down!"}
{"text":"***food review only***  i don't understand this place, i don't understand the menu, i don't understand the service, i don't understand why there isn't a daily special on sundays.  i always had the idea before i ever frequented it that the house of blues would be on par with hard rock cafe.  so naive.  it's not that the hard rock cafe is awful, it's that hob is a culinary trainwreck.  gordon ramsey would have a fit.  i think hob food can best be described as \"down home southern cookin'\" or something to that effect.  mac 'n cheese, jambalaya, rice and beans are all on the menu.  the menu is really extensive, and hob dabbles in a bit of everything apparently, but nothing on the menu looked good to me while i was here, and believe me that is saying something because i was STARVING and everything looks good to me when i'm starving.  i finally settled on the mixed field greens and a side of fries.  \"unremarkable\" is my verdict!  i had a few bites of my friend's mac 'n cheese...FAIL.  but that was to be expected, since emmy's spaghetti shack in san francisco has spoiled me for good in the mac 'n cheese department."}
{"text":"Paul Charles band was AWESOME!!  We didn't want to leave!  The food was good- service better than ok (had a trainee)."}
{"text":"I do not like this business entity. Holy cow, they rape you on the prices! A 12 oz can of beer is $5.75. 16 oz, $6.75. Tallboy, $9.50. I checked in and received a check in offer for 10% off my bill - which isn't valid on anything other than food. Who the hell eats at a venue? Shady if you ask me. We have Dan Aykroyd to blame for this, right?"}
{"text":"***THIS IS STRICTLY FOR THE LATIN NIGHT VENUE OF HOB***  House of Blues Latin nights, Thursdays @Mandalay Bay, no goood :( ENOUGH SAID. lol.  All I can really say is that me and my girlfriend were really hyped to check out this night since there are not a whole lot of Latin nights in Las Vegas, and it sounded even better that it was at Mandalay Bay. I thought it was funny that on this particular night, as me and my girl were on our way over to HOB, we listened to the Dj say on the radio say \"This place is poppin tonight!! Whoop whoop!\" YET when we arrived around at 12:30am,10 minutes before we heard the Dj's announcement, there was a total of 8 people on the dance floor :/ I would say the DJ over exaggerated a bit.   This was a very disappointing Latin night and what sucks is that this place has SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT. Great location, plenty of room to sit, a decent sized dance floor, music is perfect, BUT for some reason- NO CROWD!! I dont get it."}
{"text":"went there for breakfast with a group of 6.  i ordered the joe's scramble and really liked it.  had a side of hashbrowns.  would come back!"}
{"text":"Came for the Social Distortion concert. Place was jam packed so had a good vibe going until the band started playing. The sound was awful. There was a short and the sound engineer couldn't figure it out. If it wasn't for everyone in attendance singing along with the band, you wouldn't have known what was being sung. The instrumental sounded good but the vocal was the bad. Bad mic or bad sound check. Disappointed.  Now the after-party with Punk Rock Karaoke was freaking awesome. Good good time. It was enough for the HOB to redeem themselves and salvage the night. Still though, had the sound system issue been resolved, I would have left a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Went yesterday 1 pm. Venue was nice. Foof excellent including beef brisket and bresd pudding with caramel sauce over the top. Music was outstanding with hreat harmonies. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Came to see Santana. Great venue. I had some special circumstances and they took care of me with no problem. Jason was a great help."}
{"text":"Great ambience and decor. The layout is perfect. I even got hooked into buying some of their merchandise. I love the designs on their t-shirts. I wore one of their shirts for years until my wife threw it away. The food is great here. Your typical high end appetizers and drinks. Their live music acts rock! The acoustics are great. Not once do you ever hear muffled versions of your favorite songs. I am a fan of this franchise."}
{"text":"What's one of the best things about living in Las Vegas, you ask? Living in a city where top notch bands regularly make pit-stops to perform, of course! I probably go to House of Blues to see a concert at least once every other month. Just this month I've seen headliners In Flames and Cannibal Corpse at HoB.   PRICE: One benefit of being a metalhead is that shows are relatively cheap compared to mainstream performers. The average concert ticket ranges from $20 - $60. In Flames, for instance, was $33 per person.  PRO TIP: If you buy your tickets at the HoB Box Office at least one day before the concert (and you're a local), you get a discount! The discounted prices are ALWAYS cheaper than buying online through sites like Ticketmaster.com  THE VENUE: Overall visibility isn't the greatest. Four stupid beams/support structures get in the way of your view of the stage. Finding a good spot to watch the concert can be difficult, especially for people like me who tend to hangout towards the back of the crowds. Besides the impaired view, HoB has the BEST lighting/stage effects for a concert venue. Acoustics are awesome too. Room wise, I think HoB is the perfect size. I'm always on the General or Standing floor, and that's fine by me. There's 3 (maybe 4) floors. Alls I know is you can't see squat from the highest/top floor. I was forced to watch a Marilyn Manson concert from the top floor once. I could've used some binoculars!    RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: Mosh pits are tolerated, crowd surfing less so. Vaping is allowed indoors, smoking is not (it depends on if you get caught, though). The standing area immediately in front of the stage gets packed and messy. When pits break out, drinks go flying everywhere. Some a** holes in the VIP area or 2nd floor may throw their drinks out in the crowd.   PROS: Clean bathrooms, cool stage effects, good acoustics, locals discount. CONS: Limited visibility and sky high drink prices  RETURN VISIT? As long as the metal concerts keep coming, I'll pay to see them!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #28"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for various types of concerts. Park nearby in one of the garages for $10 or if you get lucky, snag a street spot. Make sure to double check the times on the signs! None of them are the same. If you have a band here you want to see, don't hesitate, because many of them sell out quickly. It isn't a very large venue, but that just makes for a more intimate concert experience. Concerts I've seen here:  Chevelle Excision Madeon  The sound has always been well done. I wear eareplugs with filters to the concerts because I'm usually in a bit of pain after a long night. The speakers certainly won't disappoint. Excision had absurdly crazy bass and there didn't seem to be any problem meeting those demands. I think that the bathroom attendants are unnecessary but mostly because it's just awkward that I didn't tip you for handing me a paper towel... There is a medium sized area right in front of the stage for standing, and various areas around the main floor for staying out of the big crowd. The balcony can be nice if you want a good view.   I've never bought the food, so I can't comment on that.   Drinks are expensive, as in $10 for a pounder/tallboy. It's probably for the best; it keeps the crowd from getting too drunk. I'll be coming back here for many reasons, but mostly because the House of Blues is one of the few concert venues in Northeast Ohio that actually brings bigger name bands in."}
{"text":"Seen quite a number of performers here. I'm fond of the layout of the music venue. Slash played here NYE and that was horrible (insert sarcasm font please) Slash is always phenomenal!  Then went and saw Billy Idol, seen him numerous times over the decades. Billy Idol is doing a residency at HoB, better catch his show when he returns in August! Now, he's 60 and still has that voice and note he still looks great! If only I had that jacket with the studded skull :( will post a video..."}
{"text":"Tracy was fantastic! She deserves a raise  if you get her as your server you are in for a treat! She walked my friend to the place where her Uber was picking her up. Great vibe overall and the live music was fantastic, lots of 90s throwbacks. Food is classic House of Blues fare, but atmosphere is above average which makes sense in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Things I liked:  -Reasonable priced casual lunch food at Mandalay Bay. Which says a lot for Vegas.  -Less than 10 minute wait time to seat our party of 10 ppl.  -Available seating soon after the Rock and Roll 1/2 marathon, which says a LOT, considering the race wrapped up just outside MB. We assumed this place could be jammed up.  -Burgers were good, but after 13 miles, anything would have tasted good!   Things I did not like:  -They were out of sweet potato fries. We were so excited to have some. Huge bummer.  -For not being jam packed with patrons, the service was rather slow. We had to ask a few ppl to find a server to bring water and take our orders.  -Many of our orders were not prepared as requested. Onions were included when they should not have been. Salad was delivered after the entree. Some entrees were served 5-8 minutes before the rest of the party. Stuff like that.   So, it was just OK. Not in a huge hurry to return."}
{"text":"Yasssssss. Love this place. Service was nice and food was bomb.com the atmosphere is cool and they even have us our drinks to go without us asking. How thoughtful! Coming from someone who is in the service industry I can honestly say this place is stellar."}
{"text":"Took about 30mnts to get our food. I ordered a juicy Lucy burger. It was missing the juicy! No cheese in the middle or whatever cheese it had just evaporated. Our waitress Sierra was nice and polite. She did a great job. But all our food was just way below average for the price. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"We came here to eat prior to a show at the House of Blues. Our waitress, Gentille, was very friendly and helpful. She has a great personality! She recommended the voodoo shrimp as an appetizer and the jumbalaya as an entree. We got the voodoo shrimp and they were cooked perfectly and the sauce, which had a little kick, was very tasty. I highly recommend the voodoo shrimp. My boyfriend had the jumbalaya and said it was packed full of meat and very tasty. I had a burger with cheese and bacon. It was cooked to my liking, rare, but I just wish it was seasoned a little more. This is a very cool place to eat and relax pre show. I am drinking the Bluesmobile, and it's so good that I will continue with this drink throughout the night. If you are seeing a show, stop in and ask for Gentille. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Box office was awesome! I had a problem and they took the time to solve it so thank you for that! Saw The Cult and they killed it!"}
{"text":"The main band started almost an hour late but put on a full 90 minute show plus one encore. Several technical issues with the microphones but the band played through it and put on a really energized show.  Amazing guitar work well worth seeing if you ever have the opportunity. This was my second time and they really mix it up. Nothing the same in either show except closing with Stairway to Heaven.   House of Blues, it would be nice if you got a little air moving in there to cool things off a bit and that you soup open the upstairs a little sooner."}
{"text":"We had the Sunday Gospel Brunch.  It really felt like you were in church.  Wonderful live stage performance.  Not a bad seat in the house.  Take the stairs down to the basement where the buffet and the show was held.  All you can eat buffet.  My faves were the waffles and the jambalaya.  Skip the fried chicken.  It was chicken tenders and very dry. I saw the shrimp but bypassed it.  Went back later and it was an empty platter.  It was not replenished.  There's a mimosa and bloody mary station.  Pay extra for that.  Dessert was a cobbler and a bread pudding.  Average.  4.0 stars for the performance. 3.0 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Very cool venue!  I saw a show here a few weeks ago.  My only complaint is that for \"standing room only\", there really isn't much room.  You have to be tall or really persistent to be able to see anything.  But, that being said, I look forward to coming back and trying the restaurant part of this place sometime..."}
{"text":"We went to see Billy Idol here. Billy was amazing and so much fun. I give him 5 stars! I like how small the venue is so you can see from anywhere. However we spent extra money to get a table and it wasn't good. First of all we had to sit on tiny round stools with no back. So it was very uncomfortable. Then the table was tiny. They crammed four of us in a small 2 person round table. Eventually we moved the stools and just stood. That was way more comfortable. Then the tables in front of us had taller stools ( with backs). Why do you put people in shorter stools behind people in taller stools? I don't get that. The waitress was awesome and nice. The place is great just don't buy the cheapest table seats. Worth is to upgrade to the better tables, the more expensive package. Only 3 stars for them due to the table and stool issue. And we had dinner there before hand and it was OK. Nothing special."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate breakfast here yesterday while staying in Vegas. 2 of my friends used their cards. One for merchandise and the tip and the other for the bill. The friend who bought the merchandise realized today that her card was billed for both her purchase as well as the entire bill. When we called the restaurant to resolve the issue the manager on duty,Marissa, was very nonchalant and told us that they charged both cards to see which one would go through (the other transaction had already gone through though). She said she would call back but was too busy at the moment. We went to the restaurant to discus in person as over and hour went by with no call back. When we got there she again told us she was busy and didn't have time to look into it. She never once told us she was sorry for the inconvenience or the error. After a while of arguing back and forth she finally went to the back to check and came back with a card of someone else we could call. She handed us the card said see if the charge falls off in 2-5 days and turned around and walked away with a flip of her pony tail. She was unprofessional  and rude. She acted as if we were an inconvenience to her. Because of this customer service none of us will ever return to this or any other House of Blues."}
{"text":"Here with a party of 20.  Christmas party with good friends.  Our server did a great job! Sadly I didn't ask his name. Young man in his thirties."}
{"text":"Swing dancing on Tuesday nights at the House of Blues is soooo much fun. Tons of awesome dancers who are friendly and  amazing to watch.  The bands change weekly so there are all types of good music to dance to.  Everyone should check it out. Come in your fancy duds and dance shoes! This week was a band from L.A.  The California Feet Warmers.  So much fun."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. We wanted to do the gospel brunch, but didn't realize it was only at certain times; so we just came here since it was next door.  The food was good. I had a well made omelet. The hash browns are Denny's style (grated - hard on top, soft on bottom) but tasty. No complaints about that at all.  I will complain about the service. Our server must have had a long night before or is just dumb. She brought us our drinks and I asked for a straw. We were seated next to the bar where I could see straws. She continued to check on all her other tables and go in the back. A few minutes passed and I was thirsty, so I went to the bar and got my straw. (Sorry but I will not drink from the glass at restaurants. None clean their glasses by hand and there's usually left over lip balm on the sides. Gross.) I realized I didn't have a knife and asked her for one before my food came out since I knew it would take her a while. She looked at the empty tables around us for one. None of the tables had silverware on them, our hostess put them down when we were seated. It was strange. We asked for boxes and she returned with them. Usually when guests ask for boxes, that means they are done so that's the server's cue to leave the check. Nope, we had to wait for her to make her rounds and go in the back again for her to come back and ask us if we had any coupons. Then she left again and brought us the check. It was truly annoying and because of her, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Skip this restaurant.   It will give you the blues!   Went to HOB for dinner as I was craving their new Citrus Steak Salad - which I've had twice before.  It usually on point, delicious and unforgettable.  However I was very very disappointed tonight.  The salad did not have the same flavor as it used to - it was missing the hint of ginger and heat of jalapenos.  It tasted like a plain old forgettable chopped salad with a tasteless vinegarette dressing.  I mentioned it to the waiter - who didn't really seem to care - but offered to have them redo it and add some seasoning to it - I told him what flavors were missing....He brought it out after they remade it - it tasted the same....bland.....A manager came over and I told him that  I came specifically for this salad as I've had it twice before....and he explained that they took out the ginger and jalapenos because customers were complaining.....totally did not make sense to me as it is on the menu (which was created by chef Aaron Sanchez) He offered to bring me some chopped ginger ...and he thought they may still have some jalapenos in the back - and expected me to fix it myself......I said no thank you....He said they probably had a different chef this time.   Well...my thoughts were that that chef should follow the damn recipe that was created!!!!  Service was disappointing  - they just didn't really seem to care.  Once I complained....they stopped bringing refills.  They had a live band on stage - music was way too loud in the restaurant - not the place to go if you want to have any sort of conversation.  There is also a 10% entertainment tax that is now charged in many Las Vegas venues - so be aware!!  I will NOT be going back  - Thank you to the 2 employees of HOB for ruining my previous high praises."}
{"text":"Throughout the years my friends and I have been coming to the House of Blues for concerts. A few of us recently came here last Friday for the Scissor Sisters show. We came in late and the only spots left were near the side bar. With the large pillar cutting off our direct view, I was bummed. If the artist is energetic and works the stage well, it is no problem. Luckily, SS did just that. Jake Shears and Anna Matronic moved strutted their stuff all over the place. As the show continued, people moved off and we got a better view. HoB does have TV screens to alleviate the obstructed view, but it doesn't help because they recorded it from a far distance.   A major complaint I have about most concert venues is the parking situation. While other places tend to be a free for all after a show and locks down the ramps, it was not difficult to get out of the Mandalay Bay. I was amazed since there were two concerts going on that night."}
{"text":"After a long drive, we stop by at this great restaurant Bruno was incredible ..great service and the food was delicious,a perfect dinner to start our trip in Vegas"}
{"text":"One of the best reasons to attend  a concert at the HOB is for the intimate, up close and personal feel of the venue. The prices for shows are usually pretty reasonable. But once you get inside, plan on paying good money for drinks. The place can get jam packed during popular shows. We've noticed the sound quality of some shows can be sub par. And don't expect to get a seat to a show, unless your willing to pay for a table with bottle service. I really don't know why they don't open up the seats upstairs like the good old days for us lazy folk."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Everytime we come to Vegas I have to get something from here. Hint hint bloody Mary's are awesome."}
{"text":"Our first time here, watching Led Zepagain for the first time since hearing them on Spotify. The band was EXCELLENT!  Understandably the greatest collection of LZ emulators in the world.  But I looked online and found that they let the venue run the sound and lights, and that explains how badly the sound was mixed.  The lighting was fine, but the sound mixer clearly had not been trained on this kind of music... Zep is known for screaming vocals, awesome guitar, dynamic drums, and a serious baseline.  The mixer seemed to think this was a blues band, needing to boost the vocals massively while muting the base.  Or they had the channels swapped, which is what it felt like - the bass should have been amped up and the vocals should have been relaxed a bit...  When he screamed, which he had to do all the time (duh), it actually hurt my ears!  No, not like the normal live band thing, it really hurt!  In the awesome encore Stairway to Heaven, I watched the bass playing the critical parts which I literally could not hear!  Not quite what I think the songwriters had in mind... All in all, a great concert by a seriously talented band, heavily tainted by a very badly mixed sound.  I don't think I want to try another House of Blues concert, but I would see Led Zepagain anywhere."}
{"text":"Wait was long for food and service was suuuuper slow. My brothers ordered the baby back ribs and although I didn't try them myself they said it was horrible and you couldn't but into the rib as it was full of cartilage everywhere. (I think that's what it's called) won't be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food and the service was even worst. Had too flagged down the waitress 5 times just to get a refill drink. The waitress got mad because I didn't want the salad that was given to me. Gave me a straight attitude. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I think this makes me old because I like this place cause my feet don't hurt from standing during the entire concert.  Even if you're not the first people in the standing room or have a seat reserved upstairs, you still have an okay view.  I tend to stand in the back, closest to the bars and bathrooms and not be involved in any crowd surfing or mosh pits.    Unless you're planning on needing someone to get your paper towel for you or borrowing a tampon, don't bring your purse into the bathroom.  You'll feel less like an asshole that way.    Have always had good service at the bars here, which is important.    Even though its a 'big box' concert venue, I think I prefer it over most other ones that remain in CLE.  Plus, you couldn't ask for a better location.    Somehow ended up in the Foundation Room one night where everything is gold leafed and covered in velvet with long drapes of sexy fabric separating areas.  I feel like if the show \"Blind Date\" came to CLE, this would be a good place to film in.  Cozy and awkward, but fun.    3 Stars because of the restaurant.  They keep advertising their crazy ridiculous happy hour which $1 domestics from 4-7.  I got 2 miller lights here at 6:45 (after waiting a solid 8-10 minutes at the bar) and it was $9.  UM WTF.  Bartender never even came back for me to argue this.  I mean, maybe it was already 7 bar time, but that's just ridiculous.  I'm going to go back at 3:45 and get me a dollar domestic."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here for breakfast while in Vegas. We were drawn here because they have an $8.99 breakfast deal during the week (eggs, bacon, and hash browns). The food was pretty good. We made the mistake of getting a side of biscuits and gravy to share; they were too pricey ($8) and weren't very good. The gravy tasted like it was made with pepperoni.  We also ordered mimosas which, again, were probably over priced (but it's Vegas, so whatever). Overall, the breakfast hit the spot and the service was good. Fine place to come for cheap breakfast during the week if you're looking for something simple!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite venues to see a concert! Small, intimate and easy access to both bathrooms and the bar. There really isn't a bad spot in the house especially with the bar located elevated from the floor. It makes it super easy to have a prime lookout spot over the fans watching on the floor.  Will call is right in front of the venue which makes it super convenient as well.   The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the exorbitant price of drinks when you are there. I know this is how they make their money and I fully expect Strip casinos to be charging more anyway. It just seems that it's even higher than the norm. With that being said, I will not be deterred from coming back. Just consider pregaming a bit if you don't want to break the piggy bank!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this concert venue.  Its intimate enough that there is no bad seat.  In all depends on what you are looking for when you go to a concert, but if you like to mosh, then head to the floor in front of the stage.  If you like dining and drinking while you watch the concert, then the first floor at the bar or the reserved tables surrounding the sound system is best.  If you prefer to sit like in a theater, then head to the balcony.  You can also upgrade and get private seating, for a price!  The sound is incredible, the stage is large, the lighting is superb, and its probably the best venue when seeing a concert!  I've seen many concerts here.   Bar drinks are a bit pricey, and its sometimes hard to get the bartender's attention.  You could go thirsty.  Overall, great venue.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a beautiful Cobb salad at a lively dinner with friends. Service was very good. Once music started it was hard to talk but that may be ok. Music was great!"}
{"text":"Okay, service was fine, courteous, and fast...95 dollars for greasy chicken wings, small cob salad, and a tasteless jambalaya...Come on people just say no. This was about as bad a meal I've had in LV...for 20 dollars (return) with Uber get out of the casinos."}
{"text":"I like this place.   Here's why: *their attentive *it's moderately priced *they have a lot of options on the menu--salads, meals, fish, pizza, etc *from time to time they have live entertainment *they have a Gospel Brunch on Sundays *Shrimp 'n grits are really good [sauce on the side] *it's good for groups *it's super casual *Steak salad is on the spicy side so I'd advise you to get the jalapenos on the side *it's quick"}
{"text":"We recently got married here inside Mandalay Bay at the House of Blues (at the Crossroads Restaurant). It was a unique venue that allowed us to personalize our wedding and add extra details that made it unique and special to us and our guests. There is a stage on one end of the space and a bar on the other. We performed a few songs on the stage and our guests enjoyed the open bar, southern-style food and groovy atmosphere. The wedding coordinator for the HOB, Amber, was a dream to work with. She and she staff were very professional and they helped make our Big Day stress-free. Our guests said it was one of the most unforgettable weddings that they have ever been to and we have Amber and the HOB staff to thank for that."}
{"text":"My first time going to the HOB Gospel Brunch, and I actually thought this experience was really great.  My advice: get there when the doors open, rush to your table, and go straight for the buffet.  Dump your plate of food on the table and get your dessert from the dessert station.  I say that because (1) the buffet line gets looooong, and (2) I noticed the dessert table right away and thought I would get something later after I ate... but they never refilled the Key Lime Pie and some of the other goodies that were there.  The food:  Lots of cajun classics, from jambalaya to biscuits and grits. There was also a carving station with a mound of chilled peel-and-eat shrimp.  As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see they had a vegetarian pasta... and it was delicious.  It had a bunch of veggies in it (like brocolli, califlower, tomatoes), and pesto, with melted cheese on top.  That's pretty much all I ate from the main buffet line, besides some breakfast potatoes. The french toast sticks were horrendous...obviously some food service garbage that was freezer-burned.  They also had beautiful fresh fruit, pastries, and mini bundt cakes.  The bundt cakes were chocolate, vanilla, or blueberry  (and I might have seen a lemon or pineapple one on the bottom) and I loved them.  The music:  I am not a particularly religious person and I knew absolutely nothing about gospel music. Going into it  I thought it was going to be more neutral... more inspirational than religous.  However, it was quite religious. There were tons Amens and Hallelujahs, and Jesus was thanked many times, which is fine - they were doing their thing and I respect that. They even did the classic hymn, \"Amazing Grace,\" and it was beautiful.  The singers and band overall were outstanding, and they sang for at least an hour.    It was about $40/person which I think is an excellent deal for quality food and entertainment. I would definitely go to the Gospel Brunch again, perhaps at another House of Blues to see how they do it in another city.  F.Y.I. - the noise level was about a 9/10, you couldn't hear the person next to you over the music while you were eating."}
{"text":"Other reviewers are right-- the service wasn't great. It was borderline bad. But I did order some mixed drink thinking I would like it-- big surprise, I didn't-- and our server swapped it out for a bottle of Bass for me. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it.  Although I'm from Orange County, I'd never eaten at HOB before, and since I was feeling like some cajun/Southern food, it sounded pretty good.  I had a big plate of jambalaya and it was great, but it was HUGE-- there was way too much to possibly eat in one sitting. One full sausage, two chicken legs, a half dozen shrimp, with more chunks of all of the above mixed in. I loved it, but my goodness!  For an appetizer, we also shared the catfish fritters which would have been nothing without the spicy dipping sauce that came with it! The sweet potato fries were the best I'd ever had-- finally a place that doesn't slather them with maple syrup and/or brown sugar. They were crispy and crunchy and delicious.  My boyfriend cleared his pulled pork sandwich off his plate.  We were there for his birthday but didn't really ask whether they did anything for that, so I'm not sure. Overall though, we enjoyed the meal and look forward to trying the HOB in Anaheim. Maybe their service is a little better."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is average.   Open for breakfast & way cheaper than the other sit down breakfast places in Luxor or Mandalay Bay. Has a bounce back coupon, eat breakfast here one morning, get a coupon for the following day 2-4-1 breakfast entree.   Also has a rocking Happy Hour from 2 - 6 pm Monday - Friday $2.00 domestic pints, $3.00 import pints."}
{"text":"Mandalay Bay is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that.  I have to say that the House Of Blues is a great place to hang out and see bands.   I went to see Motorhead a couple years back and was blown away!   The venue was just the right size.  Not to big, not to small.   Never dined here, just had drinks, but the experience was great!"}
{"text":"This review is for the food.  AMAZING.  We woke up rather late and were starving.  One of my friends said \"I'm feeling a big fat juicy burger with mushrooms and avocado and sweet potato fries\" and the next minute four drooling women were on a major mission.  We walked into The Café in The Hotel and saw maybe two burgers on the menu, with overly fancy fixings for $18.  FAIL!    On our way to get a quick Starbucks, me and another gal checked the menu for House of Blues as we passed by and low and behold- burgers and sweet potato fries for about $12!!!    Our waiter, Angel, was super sweet and did an awesome job of taking care of us!    I'm adding this place to the short list for best sweet potato fries, ever!  Sweet, slightly salted, crispy, and delicious and Angel recommended the spicy tarter sauce to go with (SO GOOD).  I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and it was heaven in my mouth; grilled onions and shrooms falling out all over the place, juice all over my hands.  Lawd.  I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Sin City!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Went to see Joe Walsh, who put on a great show. Liked the venue. Small enough for a more intimate show but didn't feel crowded. We only decided to go at the last minute, so all we were able to get were general admission seats. That meant standing for a good hour and a half before the show started, which was not fun, but the bar was nice enough and the drinks were good. We had dinner before the show in the restaurant, and had a pretty decent jambalaya. It was a little on the mild side for my taste, but otherwise OK. Our server was fantastic. She was attentive and made sure that everything went smoothly with our meal. I would definitely go back again to see a show."}
{"text":"Came here for a concert and it was packed on the first floor. They finally opened the upstairs after a little while and it was open seating, so we were able to sit while enjoying the show.  There was only one bar opened upstairs and the line was super long with only one bartender working. We got a total of five beers and it came out to $80.00 which in my opinion is way too expensive but we had waited in line for so long already that a beer was much needed.  Btw, the bathroom was clean with no line."}
{"text":"Have you ever had that moment when you were so excited to go somewhere and you have heard nothing but excellent things about it and then you get to experience it for yourself and you want to go back and backhand everyone that told you such amazing things about it? If so, welcome to the world of House of Blues.   Santana was back at the house of Blues and I have wanted to see him forever so as a Christmas gift I received 2 VIP ticket packages somewhere around $250 a piece tickets that had been advertised to include, Early access to the music hall with advanced seating, a bottle of champagne or wine, chocolate covered strawberries, and a few other things outside of the venue that dont matter here.   With doors opening at 7:30 we figured we would go to the venue around 7:15 and with the VIP badge we would walk right in. That was in fact the complete opposite. The General admission line to the left of us was simply pooring right into the music hall while we waited in a rope made coral. The hostess told us that they are short handed tonight so there will be a little wait to be seated.. I Can understand a place being short handed so guess that is no big deal right? If this was a 5 minute wait that would be no big deal but we then stood outside while all the others people walked right in for over 15 minutes, Once the lady opened up the rope she got on the radio and let them know table 26 was coming down and she let us know the usher would meet us at the bottom of the stairs and escort us to our table. At the bottom of the stairs we were greeted by a woman that said... Oh you are VIP? go ahead and wait right here and points into the middle of a group of people so we then waited there getting in and out of peoples way for the next 10 minutes. Until an usher finally came to get us to take us to the table.   Once we got to our table or maybe we should call it our position in the sardine box we waited forerver for the server to come take our order. We ordered the bottle of wine which she did end up bringing to the table pretty quick but said, \" I need to go drop off this other bottle and then Ill be right back to open it up for you\" 25 minutes later she returned to ask how we are doing and that is when I think she realized I was not happy and discovered we had just sat there with an unopened bottle of wine.  The show itself was amazing and Santana is a musical Monster but this establishment is not as Intimate as people say it is, unless you are talking about the fact that you sit so close to the guy next to you that you can smell his breath. My one recomendation would be not to pay for the crazy priced VIP packages, instead, choose to site in the balcony seating, it was comfy movie theater like seats and the view would have been amazing. I may give this place another try for a general admission rock concert or something but definitely not for a seated show like this one."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much reviewing this just based on the atmosphere....which is really REALLY cool in my opinion. The downstairs is really open, with a bar, a large dance floor, and stage for concerts. The band playing that night was pretty good, and it was fun to kick back on the balcony above it and bop around to the music. I was there for an event, so we had free wine and beer for a bit (although I was only able to take advantage of one free glass of wine, BOOO) and although I didn't personally try any of the food, the guys I was there with scarfed a bunch of spicy-smelling chicken wings and fries.  The crowd is pretty good, too. Even though it's in Mandalay Bay, right on the strip, it didn't seem to attract your typical bro-man Vegas crowd, at least not the night I was there (which was Saturday). I'd actually like to have a conversation with the any of the patrons at House of Blues. Four stars for that alone."}
{"text":"House of Blues has tons of shows.  Some of the bands that play here have been on the radio, some of them just have a large underground following.  There are 21+, and all ages shows.  From metal to gospel, there's almost always something worth seeing.   It can get very crowded here, and mosh pits are not unusual.  Avoid the HOB if you're claustrophobic.  Smoking has been banned inside the show room.  This is great for non-smokers, and not-so-great for smokers.  If you go upstairs for a cigarette during intermission, you're sure to lose your spot for the next band. Unfortunately the shows here aren't the cheapest.  Tickets can range from $15 to $100+ depending on who's playing, and you can count on paying about 25% more in ticketmaster, and \"house\" fees.   Security has been an issue in the past.  I've seen people get kicked out for things they absolutely weren't doing (and people NOT getting kicked out for being complete pigs).  I've had shows cancelled after I bought tickets, and have not had my money returned.  Also, I have no idea what determines if a show should be all-ages, or not, but whatever the formula is, it has appeared to be wrong on several occasions (imagine trying to enjoy LMFAO with about 200 \"provocatively\" dressed 13 year olds). I've seen dozens of my favorite bands here, so I can't complain TOO much.   House of Blues is a bit expensive, pretentious, and unpredictable, but it's still not a bad venue by Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Caught a lot of concerts here while Steel Panther was doing their Saturday-Midnight residency, and enjoyed them. We'd usually get there early and camp out on the rocks next to the gift shop entrance so as to have place to sit and wait instead of standing in the line (which would sometimes go all the way to the tattoo shop), because we'd have to stand once we got inside, as well. The concert venue is nice, though the beer is expensive... though beer is always expensive in Vegas, and at concert venues, so I suppose that comes with the territory. The bands we saw play always sounded great, and the security personnel were professional and friendly. They weren't there to hassle you, just there to make sure everyone started out and remained okay during their time there. I wore a kilt to several of the concerts and did get a few odd looks from the people running the metal-detector lines, but I'm used to it so that's not a big detractor. Overall, I'd gladly see more concerts here, though Santana has a capacity to run long from time to time so if he's nearing the end of a stint or going on tour in the near future (and thus abdicating his spot for a few weeks), be ready to wait longer in line as they get everyone out and the place cleaned up for the next act. Or, if you're there to see Santana, be prepared to order an extra drink when he runs long. It's all good."}
{"text":"Everything went as planned when I went to go see Mac Miller's concert! The service was impeccable & The staff is also friendly & helpful. I can't forget James, everytime I had a question or concern he was the first to jump up & help can't beat him!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating breakfast and dinner here during my birthday vacation.  Breakfast was good nothing really special but filling. Now, dinner was another experience. It was a toss up between Jambalaya or Baby back ribs, I chose the Jambalaya.  Wished they had a combo plate, both would've been delicious. Jambalaya was tasty not overly spicy the portions could've been a bit larger or maybe I was hungry which is why the food disappeared so fast! The live music got started when dinner arrived.  The Blues goes well with Jambalaya and for dessert Bourbon Bread pudding topped with toffee sauce and bourbon butter was made to be savored with a cup of coffee.  Service was friendly & paced well.  I didn't feel rushed or neglected. I would've stayed all night but ... when in Vegas... the machines were calling my name.  Atmosphere =A. Food =B+"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices on food and drink. We had a group of 9 and were taken care of by an awesome waiter. There is Rock Star karaoke with a live band. People signed up immediately and we spent the evening listening to some real talent. Very enjoyable night."}
{"text":"What a freakin rip off! Friends wanted to see Fortunate Son, a CCR tribute band. 16 bucks a ticket for a tribute, ok. Then you get there and they tell you, would you like to sit? MF'ers then charge 25 bucks to sit at a table. Dishonest thieves!"}
{"text":"If your a foodie this may not be the place for you!!! Nothing spectacular or over the top. No lasting.memory of the food or experience here."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the House of Blues as a concert venue.  We've been here twice (both times to see Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers perform) and I will say that the venue itself is awesome!  Very cool vibe - open and spacious, although it still gives you the feeling of being small.  The decor and lighting makes you feel as though you are transported to a different city.  For us - we prefer standing room for concerts - so you can move in closer and the setting is more intimate. It almost seems as you are at a private concert with just you and the band.  The crowd really gets into it - and the bands feel the energy!  Although our friends have told us that HOB Las Vegas can get shoulder to shoulder crowded for events, both times we've been there it has been perfect.    The bar area is elevated, with stairs or a ramp leading you down to the floor area.  Even being 5 ft 2 I never felt like I had to struggle to see over the person in front of me.  The sound quality is also awesome!  The only complaint I have, with that of any concert venue, is the bar and beer selection.  Although it was super easy to get a beer (no lines) the prices were pretty ridiculous.  $26 for two Coronas (okay - so they WERE king cans of Corona) but still - a little insane.  But again that's expected when you're out to see a concert.  A definite plus is that being a Vegas venue - the band was able to play past midnight (almost 3 and a half hours), unlike a lot of places where they are cut off early!  House of Blues in Vegas is one of our favorite concert venues!"}
{"text":"I have the biggest girl crush on the House of Blues.  Like, if it were a person, I would ask it on a date.  Maybe I'm totally sheltered? Because I think this is the best venue EVER to see a concert.  There isn't a bad seat in the house. If you aren't into getting punched in the face by random strangers, you can chill out upstairs and still have a good view.  If you aren't a marathon stander, you can (usually) get seats and have a great view.  Really, I think it's a perfect venue.  The sound is always great.    My favorites shows have been at the House of Blues - maybe I'm biased.  But I think given the prices of tickets and the quality of the sound and the size - you can't go wrong with the HOB."}
{"text":"We went to the Santana concert Sept 22.... and bought VIP seats on the lower level.  The information we received was a little sketchy...was told that the concert started at 7, it really started at 8pm.  Of course this completely interfered with our dinner reservations and we had to leave the concert early.   The seats were amazing...about 30-40 feet from the stage. I would highly recommend springing for the more expensive seats!!"}
{"text":"I like corn bread. The HOB corn bread is the best I've had....ever. And the honey maple butter thing with it....sheeee get out man! Now why don't they have this by where I live? Think I'll search for it now.  On this particularly insomnified night, I'm thinking of all the places I've eaten & Yelpin' 'em all from memory....testing, testing....."}
{"text":"Most people either love HOB or hate it--- personally, I will only go there if somebody totally awesome is playing, and that is not frequent any more. Like some others have mentioned, things have changed in the past few years-- and yes, the ticket fees are ridiculous and annoying.   Aside from that, I really hate the whole \"standing room only\" thing, especially since there is always some huge goon that thinks his Daddy was a glassmaker up front.   I really want to like this place, as it reminds me in some ways of the old Cleveland Agora, but just does not measure it. Maybe it is just the \"franchise\" feel of it that turns me off...but I'd prefer almost any other venue in town to this one."}
{"text":"Great breakfast decent prices would recommend. Nice atmosphere polite staff.  Clean environment"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it was a very positive experience!   Kenny and Kate were the bartenders, and were both excellent.  I got the Herb Crusted Salmon Salad.  It was the best salad I have had in a long time, and I eat a lot of salads.  The place has a great atmosphere, as well.  I would love to come here when they have live music in the main dining room, as it seems like the perfect layout for it.  I highly recommend you visit here!"}
{"text":"It is called House of Blues because you get the blues after spending so much God damned money at this pit. The staff is grumpy too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, all of them for metal concerts (Dimmu Borgir and Mastadon) and I can say full heartedly that I'm a fan of this place. The venue is easy to find from Mandalay Bay's parking garage. Just go into the casino, proceed past the Light Nightclub and enter the casino floor. Turn your head left and TA-DA! Huge lights saying \"House of Blues.\" So let's get to the main part of the review.  Venue: The venue is actually quite small in terms of stages. It has an upper floor with seating for other shows besides for concerts, but I'm rating it strictly as a concert venue. The floor is surrounded by a bar area, so drinks are easily accessible at any time. As far as concerts go, I prefer smaller venues to bigger ones because they seem more intimate. Being able to feel \"close\" to the band as they perform no matter where you are is pretty neat. That means you won't miss a beat! (Haha, music joke) They put up guards at the front of the stage during concerts, as do most places and they actually make a really good place to lean on between sets if you are lucky enough to be in the front and don't plan on moving anytime soon. It is also nicely decorated. I love the chandelier that they have, in the middle of the place, the tinted glass windows and the whole vibe the place gives off. It makes a great rock band venue.   Service: The people that work here, from the times I've been there are nice and personable. I mean, come on, it's hard not to be when you get to see free shows, right? Right. In any case, booze is always easily accessible. The cool part is that during concerts, if you are one of those lucky people against the guard rail right in front of the stage, a waitress comes around between the guard rail and stage to take drink orders so you don't have to move. BONUS! I didn't get anything to drink though, because drink prices in venues scare me. To rich for my blood. The actual people in charge of watching the event let you have a little fun, but do the appropriate thing when bad stuff goes down. They also help crowd surfers.   This is a great place to go see a concert, especially if you are a rock fan. The mood, atmosphere and small venue make it easy to mosh, drink, and/or enjoy yourself. If you know somebody coming to Vegas and feel like going to the show, hopefully you get lucky and get the House of Blues. :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite one evening. The food was ok. The prices seem a bit high, but that is to be expected for Vegas I guess. But the highlight of our visit was our server! Our waiter was Kurt and he was so friendly and helpful. Ask to be seated in his section and you will have a great experience."}

{"text":"The review is for the bar area. The food was just ok. Service was also just ok. I Liked the decorations at the bar. We walked around and the whole place is really nice and has cool features. There is also a small retail store inside."}
{"text":"SOOO impressed!!!! After I posted my review I was immediately contacted by the house of blues staff(Sahsha,Brian Klein,and Tim J.)  I was so  impressed on how fast they responded to the situation at hand.  They were very apologetic,professional,accommodating and they went above and beyond to turn a bad situation into and AMAZING memory.  I have told numerous friends,family and clients about my incredible  experience and how the House of Blues rocks.  What could have been disaster, has now made me a bigger fan and I can't wait to go back. The Venue is AWESOME , very intimate,and the service was outstanding. I HIGHLY recommend House of Blues for an up close and personal music experience with service unmatched by any other.  THANKS HOUSE OF BLUES  MAUREES"}
{"text":"The drinks here are good, pricey, but really? You threw out the coupons and discount store deals once you stepped on the Vegas strip. They didn't have a band when I went, just check to see when they do have bands playing on their site. The artichoke dip and the bread pudding were so good, I can't enjoy those things as much as pre-house of blues Jessica did. My standards were raised. I want to try the one here, closer to where I live, but this place was great (food-wise), the waiter I had was distracted by something and seated us (me and my dad) in the leper section apparently, everyone else in the entire restaurant were all seated about half a football field distance away from where we were told to sit. The bread pudding though, try it! I don't care about your diet, you eat that bread!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop of the night. We had some drinks and the vibe was casual and relaxing. The noise level wasn't too loud so we were able to converse normally. I certainly enjoyed my time here!"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite house of blues to go to. The staff here is incredible and the venue itself is nice. I've been here multiple times to see Steel Panther and have spent many birthdays on stage with them! This HOB has a lot of seating upstairs too!!! Love it and I'm sure you will too!"}
{"text":"Steel Panther!!!  Steel Panther does a show here every Friday.  I highly reccomend that.  The drinks are overpriced, but the show is free so it's worth it.  No seats unless you pay VIP, which is REALLY expensive.  But there is plenty of room to stand around and rock out."}
{"text":"We were a bit worried that the food here would be mediocre or below because of the similarities to Hard Rock Cafe. We were happily surprised!! My wife had the meatloaf and loved every bite of it. I had the Cajun pasta and while not truly spicy the sauce on the table made up for that. -1 star for the constant self promotional commercials running on every TV. Including the big screen on the stage. Why couldn't they play videos or concert footage?"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for a conference and we had a private event here one evening.  The food was pretty good.  Sliders were tasty (pulled pork and meatball were the best...angus was just \"meh\"), the shrimp and grits were delicious, as was the jambalaya.   Bartenders were great, drinks were good and the music selection had everyone dancing.  The place has a cool look and vibe.  So why only two stars?  This HOB suffers from the same issue as the one in Chicago.  The music is deafening!  I was standing beside someone trying to have a conversation (after all, this was a social event in connection with a conference) and as we were shouting at each other to be heard, they actually turned the music up!  We just looked at each other and laughed because even though we were three inches from each other, there's no way we could continue the conversation.  Thankfully, one of the big cheeses from the conference was able to get them to turn it down a notch about 10 minutes later but by the time I left, my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse from shouting.    If there's a live band, I guess that's one thing but just cranking it up so loud that everyone has to stand there with no interaction because it's physically too loud to converse, that's not terribly fun in my book.  I guess this must be a corporate decision since the loud music seems to be consistent but I don't think I'd choose to go to another HOB in the future because I actually like to interact with the people I go out with.  Except maybe in Houston, because that location was okay.  Side note: If you search for the word \"loud\" in the reviews, you get 26 hits.  Most of them complain about it being too loud."}
{"text":"Drinks took 20 minutes. Food was decent, very generic. The service was horrible. They kids menu is photo copied. The crayons are clearly from the 99cent store. The spinach artichoke dip was only spinach dip. The sangria was HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"The House of Blue's is a great place to see a concert. The atmosphere is fun and the sound is spectacular. They have a good bar and a nice area to eat. I've seen a few concerts here and hope to see many more!"}
{"text":"HOB as a concert venue:   Went for a concert. In the general admission standing room \"only\" area you can get great pics of the band and get pretty close to the stage. Good sound and cool venue. Expensive drinks ($14 for 2 cocktails or $9.50 for a tall beer)! No specialty drinks in the concert venue. In the standing room only area there are a few first come first serve stools along one side of the place with a little railing in front of them - side view. Some shows also sell tickets to the upstairs balcony. And for the 1st time I noticed there were \"club seats (stools)\" behind the standing area but right in front of the stage.   The walls are actually really full of cool art if you have the chance to look around."}
{"text":"Really awesome staff and very welcoming atmosphere. Would recommend to come in for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"We did the sunday brunch and the music was good and the food was good, but not great. It was enjoyable and would not mind going back again. Something spiritual for a Sunday morning. :-)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner but to my dismay as every other dining option in Mandalay Bay had ridiculous waits. The menu is a hodge podge of heart attack-inducing foods with random influences that you would expect for all their calories would taste good but instead are completely bland and gross. The service was poor and the food took forever to come out even on a night when the place was only half full. The noise level was obscene. For half of our meal they had a horrible crooner screaching into the mic that made it impossible to hear the person sitting next to you. The second band was half decent at least and made the end of our meal a bit more enjoyable and fun."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The venue seemed nice, and we thought we had decent seats since we were in the 3rd row back (section 200 row C) however upon sitting down found that the incline and the safety bars obstructed our view to a degree that we almost never could see anything on stage without the bars in the way. Not sure why they dont have clear glass railings? Ticketmaster didnt mention obstructed view so you may want to see if there is a seat map showing if there are obstructions, definitely would have paid more $$$ for a seat that I could see!  Disappointing sound quality, speakers were not always clear.  Tall cans of beer were a whooping $14/each.  They had Heineken, Corona, Bud light and paps.  Billy Idol was great though!!! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Thursday night dinner at House of Blues for many years, as we enjoy seeing some of our favorite local bands play during dinner. Last night was the first time we have been there in a couple months, and were severely disappointed.  To start the night off poorly, the hostess placed us, essentially, on the casino floor in the farthest table from the stage. We asked if we could have one of the empty tables closer to the stage, being told \"no, there is no server for that section.\" Before our drink order was taken, there were people seated at those empty tables.  Then, looking at the menu, we were even more disappointed and aggravated. We expect to pay more than normal restaurant prices to eat at House of Blues. However, $3.99 for an ice cream scoop of luke warm/cold mashed potatoes and the same price for an equal amount of snap peas is asinine.   Their entire menu has drastically gone up in price and down in selection. None of the good items are available anymore.  The only reason two stars got marked, after talking to one of the floor managers, she apologized at the illogical reason we were not permitted to sit at quality tables, moved us to a better section and comp'd us some drinks and dessert. Our servers were also pretty on top of things.   After having that first, bad experience as we got to the restaurant, it tilted the night's mood."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! No trip would be complete without a stop here. Ask for Aune she is the best. Two days in a row and she remembered our preferences. Sweet!"}
{"text":"I really have a love/hate relationship with the HOB.  This used to be THE spot for shows.  It is small, intimate and has a great vibe.  Since The Joint expanded, I am no longer a fan of HOB.  The Joint is still small enough and is never quite as crowded as this place gets.  I mean, they really JAM the people in.  Maybe because I am getting old, but I am just not down with fighting for space with a bazillion other people.  The last show I saw here was Social Distortion, and we ended up leaving early - crazy!  It was way too packed, it took forever to get in, and I didn't want to pay $10 for a PBR tall boy.  I HATE PBR.  I drank about 1/2 my beer and it made my tummy hurt (yes, I am a beer snob), and I just couldn't stand there with the guy next to me elbowing me all night.  Overall, shows are a decent price.  The location is cool - inside Mandalay Bay and near most of the bars/restaurants of Mandalay Place."}
{"text":"Great venue, food is standard, but overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Service is very slow.  There were probably a total of 10 people in the restaurant and it was a very long wait for food.  The first time I came here I ordered the all twisted up skillet which is just a bunch of veggies mixed in with eggs and topped with cheese.  It was very good and flavorful--the first time.  The second time I was like meh.  It was just totally bland but edible the second time.  Husband got the biscuits and gravy the first time and some sort of chorizo and egg dish the second time with a pancake.  The pancake was as large as the plate but arrived at least 10-15 mins before the main dish came out.  Really?  Anyways...if you are looking for a quick breakfast look elsewhere.  That's my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was not that great! We had lunch here so not much going on. I'm sure the night life is much better!"}
{"text":"I go to a LOT of shows. That means I go to a LOT of venues. I have never been all that blown away by House of Blues, except that they bring in great acts. I was here for a phenomenal Ingrid Michaelson show. It's the perfect-sized venue for a show like that. The pro is varied seating - high tops, floor standing, seats up in the balcony. The negatives are the huge amount of obstructed seats and the prices for mediocre food and beverages. The bathrooms are also GROSS. While I get that it's a concert venue, it's also a bar and restaurant so let's maybe clean it up a little bit?  Definitely a good spot to go for a show but be sure to get in early if you want an unobstructed view. Also, stay away from the bar area if you are a fan who wants to hear the act --- gets LOUD in there.  Definitely worth it to see an act you like in a fairly small venue but I wouldn't go just to go experience a House Of Blues. And I definitely wouldn't go just for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I liked my breakfast again.  They should relax their serving times.  10:45, hubby wanted a salad.  'you have to wait until 11.' OK.  Whatever."}
{"text":"Kayla who works in ticket sales at the House of Blues Box Office is a Rock Star! Super friendly and very helpful. Thank you Kayla!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great food and excellent service by our very friendly and accommodating server: Bretani. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal here.  I love the waffles, but had the eggs and corned beef hash.  In spite of the fast food nature of the kitchen this place has great food.  I do really like this restaurant, but advise that breakfast has the most consistently good food here.  Lunch, and dinner can sometimes be an adventure."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of House of Blues, more so because of the live music.  The food isn't anything special, satisfying nonetheless.  The service was also satisfactory.  Fun ambiance though!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for work, had dinner at House of Blues.  Reasonable prices for a casino and the food was tasty. Service was top notch... our server Jennifer was great!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice while I was staying at Mandalay Bay.  In the evening I had a Juicy Lucy, I found two hairs on my plate.  The fries were soggy.  The food was bland.  Despite my bad experience I came here again the next morning and got an Eggs Florentine because we had free gift cards to eat here.  The English Muffins were stale and our waiter forgot to bring us silverware.  We also ordered two drinks that our waiter forgot to bring us even though they showed up on the bill.  If you are staying at Mandalay Bay, I recommend eating someplace else."}
{"text":"Tried to come in here for an early lunch at about 10:40 on the morning we checked out of Mandalay. They weren't serving lunch until 11 and didn't offer us the opportunity to just hang around so we ended up ordering breakfast. I got the gravy and biscuits (which the waitress immediately corrected to \"biscuits and gravy\" - strange) and the wife got a breakfast burrito that seemed pretty standard.  Overall we were in and out in less than 30 minutes. Service was ok, food was ok, kind of annoyed by the whole thing, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Ohio, I was in Cleveland for the Frozen Diamond Faceoff.  We decided to find a place to eat and grab some drinks before the game. We ended up at the House of Blues.  Upon entering, there was a small crowd; however, there were empty tables. We got taken through the main dining area into a small overflow type room on the side. When we went into the room, we were seated near a group of 30 people. They took up several tables and seemed to be having a good time.  It took a few minutes for the waitress to take our order. After that, this is where the trouble began.  After an hour of waiting for our food, we finally asked the manager what was going on. He said they were extremely busy and there was a back-up in the kitchen. I thought this might be related to the large crowd; however, they were finishing their food when we came in. He did end up buying us a round of drinks.  When our food did come out, my order came out wrong. I ordered sweet potato fries and ended up with regular fries. No big deal, they just brought me the correct fries.  My cousin and his brother-in-law ordered the same burger. The waitress told them the only way this burger was made was well done which was great for them. When their burgers came out and they cut into the burgers, blood started pouring out. My cousin dealt with his; however, his brother-in-laws was nearly raw inside. They clearly tried to rush the burgers on a hot grill and only managed to cook the outside.  We didn't have time to wait for a re-fire, so my cousin's brother-in-law just didn't get to eat. It took us nearly 2 hours to have lunch here and one person left without getting to eat anything.  We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Ahhh the good ol' HOB. Man..I remember when this was THE concert spot ..the ultimate place to see your favorite performer and also the ultime spot for a performer to play.  I can start my review off memories , some blurry because of the alcohol , contact high or simply because I was in a musical orgasm; However it would not be fair for the readers  The place is small. Lets face it. You will end up tasting the sweat of the person right next to you .I can tell you the night before going to a HOB concert I pray to the Gods that the people around me decided to take a shower before the event.  On the flip side..small means close..close means better vibe..better vibe means awesome show! So if you are ok with all that.. it is still a very cool venue specially if you choose to sit on the balcony where there are movie theater kinda seats .  Sound is outdated. Sadly to report they seem to not want to upgrade the speakers nor their (speakers)location. Usually they have to retune , or the sound is simply not that good. The place have a lot of wood which is great for sound..but when you have the same speakers that \"the wonders\" from \"that thing you do\" had..then you are pretty much done.  They are selling food now.Hot dogs pizza , etc. And the price is actually pretty damn good for being inside the venue that is inside a casino. It amazingly tastes pretty good as well(for concert food of course). Food tends to go fast and wait time might be a little long but I think its pretty awesome to have the availability .  Drinks are just ok. Sometimes you get that water downed vodka and cran, but they will NEVER forget to charge you more than 12 dollars for it. Seriously HOB? I mean you are selling 5 dollars pizza but a 12 dollars Barbie sized cocktail? On the flip side..they sell tall boys and that's what I stick with  This place is where its at right now due lack of investment and love from its owners . Music artists don't want to play where they know their concert is not gonna be up to par. People don't want to go to weak concerts and then the whole chain reaction starts.Trust me ;the concept is awesome and I love the feel of a private venue, without the crazy expensive ticket price and with a cool ambiance. Im sure if HOB decides to take care of their spot , all this could change.  Rock out with your YELP out !"}
{"text":"First time here was looking to try something new decided on the Cajun chicken pasta. Very dry and plain. I don't recommend it. Also If they have performers  on stage they charge a 10% entertainment fee, which was not explained prior to sitting. We didn't even dine there for entertainment."}
{"text":"Megan, the manager, is a Superstar. We all know that servers can sometimes have a bad day. Megan did a great job fixing the mistakes and making it overall, a great experience. It's not really what goes wrong but how it's handled."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would. Terrible, terrible, terrible brunch. Possibly the worst food in Vegas (at least of the food I have tried in Vegas). The brunch is especially terrible if you are vegetarian or health conscious. Nothing healthy and no true vegetarian options. Everything that I tried was disgusting (e.g. omelet station, salads, country potatoes, mac and cheese). You will only enjoy the food if you also enjoy Denny's.  As for the entertainment, it was decent. Some might call it a fun experience. If you are willing to pay $50 to hear gospel church music, then this is your spot. The vocalists were decent singers and the experience was somewhat entertaining. Overall, I think it's a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks.  We told the staff that we were seeing the Cirque show in an hour. At the hotel. He said no worries. We had the bacon wrapped poppers.  Ick. Cheese burger and salad. The food came out 5 minutes before we had to leave.  It had been sitting on a warmer. Kinda pricey, food is ok, but the service is atrocious. Better choices in town."}
{"text":"I decided to check out House of blues for brunch. The food was okay. Probably the best place for brunch in Mandalay Bay. There aren't many great places to eat at Mandalay, especially for brunch. I had an egg sandwich, eggs over easy on a buttermilk biscuit along with a side of fresh fruit. My eggs were not over easy. In fact they were overcooked. How do you mess up eggs? I just don't understand how restaurants do this. The biscuit was rich and yummy..they did not mess that up. Overall the breakfast was just okay, but 10 times better than the Mandalay buffet and room service. Therefore if I stay at Mandalay again, I may eat here again out of pure convenience."}
{"text":"This review goes for the concert hall  For me, this place is as good as it gets for a show.  Its not too big, not too small.  I have seen In Flames, Shadows Fall, Trivium and just recently Steel Panther here.  I love this place!  Steel Panther apparently play most Saturdays here and I would highly recommend the show as they are very entertaining."}
{"text":"Server is James. He carries this place. Even without the solid meal, the service from James blew me away. This is a genuine, friendly, helpful, quick, knowledgeable guy who got me excited about my meal and feel inspired by the menu. He mentioned Aaron Sanchez (chef from Chopped!!) when describing the menu and the intended vibe of the restaurant. Chef Sanchez has several items that he personally crafted for the venue, like the beer burrito meal (beer in a brown paper bag and a breakfast burrito to cure a hangover), and the bacon avocado eggs Benedict.  Coffee came quickly. Freshly brewed. Really hit the spot.   The bacon avocado eggs Benedict came with the delicious Hollandaise sauce"}
{"text":"Worst service ever !!!! Waited an hour for a table for three !!!' After traveling 10 hours wanting food and alcohol they told us the wait was only 30mins ... they were seating people that came after us before us .... also people were coming up saying they had reservations they were telling people to come closer to their time a guy came literally one minute before ... and had to wait longer because they weren't ready ... hostesses suck at their job so disappointed this Military family went over to a slice of vegas and had way better service !!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out and really liked it the food was great and you get a lot the price wasn't too bad and they have live music, I would recommend to have a reservation, because if not you will be waiting for awhile to get in. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice and comfortable. I would check out who is playing the night you go so you know who is going to performing. sometimes they have big bands, try them out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  I was really expecting this to be like a hard rock cafe (and their food is horrible at best), but the food was great!  Price was good.  I had a Cesar salad and BBQ Chicken Flatbread.  Chicken on the flatbread was amazing.  It was real BBQ chicken...not diced frozen bits.  Hubs had an Island Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries and it was DELISH!  I made me wish I had ordered it as well!  Nicely seasoned.  My sister-in-law had the mac and cheese, also very very good! Nice and creamy, smooth, but lots of cheese taste without being too sharp.   I loved the decor.  I could have looked at the walls, floors, and ceiling all day.  Of course the music inside was good.  Service was great and our waiter even recommended a few things to do and see besides the obvious.  If you are in the area you should stop by, don't pass it up thinking it is going to be like those other franchise rock places."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Chicken and waffles had no flavor and the waffles were very thick and dry. My latte was the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"Will make this short and sweet ~ Went here One time, one time too many.  I think because of their name and where they are located they think they can get top dollar for everything on the menu. This place is very expensive. Don't get me wrong the food is good. It is just crazy to pay the prices here because your hungry. There are far more places to eat at in Vegas and close by you don't need to come here Service is slow and it takes forever to get your food. The place does get pretty busy.  So not worth going here and we will not go back."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here. We had a little wait to get in so our table could be set up. There was no live music but still the environment is fun. The food is average for breakfast, nothing out of my group made us want to come back. Had to constantly ask for refills on drinks. Waitress was sweet but seemed to be still waking up for her shift."}
{"text":"Good food and the service was great too. From the moment we got there the host were welcoming and friendly, and our server was awesome as well. It was nice to have the manager show up to our table and check on us. I will be back and I will be happy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner while in Vegas, and actually had a decent time. I'm generally hesitant when headed to a corporate chain restaurant, in fear of an over-priced and mediocre meal.  I guess Aaron Sanchez is the chef here? Honestly, the food was pretty decent. Our meals ranged from mac n' cheese, to the chicken sandwich, ribs, and jumbalaya. All was thoroughly enjoyed and savored.   They didn't have live music playing when we were there, but they did have music playing in the background. The vibe is pretty modern, upbeat, and fun.   Not bad! I was pretty impressed."}
{"text":"I came her with my gf and we enjoyed their 8.99 egg meat and hash brown breakfast. Food was great with appropriate portion. Service was the highlight of our dinning experience. Zero pressure to order, no rush to leave. Walked away with a 20$ tab which is cheap for a meal on the strip in vegas."}
{"text":"Food: Delicious! Had the fried chicken here with mash potatoes and fries, just what I was in the mood for.   Price: Not bad, portions were pretty big and the food was good.  Service: Friendly. Our server was cool and very attentive.   Atmosphere: Pretty chill in here, different music videos were playing on the tvs around the restaurant. Dark setting.  Location: Located at Mandalay Bay near the tattoo place."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast. I ordered the sampler and everything was luke warm. The yolks of my over easy eggs were solid. The portions were huge and the pancakes were tasty but everything was overpriced. With the price I paid please bring my food to me warm and cook my eggs right. Even my mimosa couldn't redeem my experience."}
{"text":"Went to see Steel   Got to the show just in time.  Large forum, easy to see where ever you stand.  We were able to walk right up to the stage during the show, even though the floor was a bit crowded.  Everyone was friendly and service was good.  We weren't here to eat so I didn't experience the food just the alcohol and show."}
{"text":"The selena kareoky by who..... Any ways what a JOKE... tottaly a fake venue even worst than lip singing is a fake band lol OMG .. But a good time with frinds and $18 dollars beers and $10 parking fees for locals"}
{"text":"Decent food option in the Mandalay.  Southern style eats were OK, not fantastic, but OK.  Good coffee at breakfast!  And a pretty decent happy hour too."}
{"text":"Went here with a restaurant.com gift card and received $50 off the bill so that factors into my perception of value.  There were no hassles redeeming the certificate which isn't always the case. I took my young teenage daughter and her friends out for her birthday celebration and we enjoyed ourselves.  Outsider art covering the walls and downtown location made for cool experience. It was loud, which was odd because restaurant wasn't really crowded.  Server was great: professional, kind and she even sang a special birthday song Ronny daughter. Tater tot appetizer was good for sharing. Burgers and tacos looked good. I got shrimp and grits and it was just ok.  This place is well equipped to accommodate large groups: a girls hockey team came in and all 25+ were easily seated."}
{"text":"Twitter? Waste of time, right? Not always. I saw a chance to win tickets to see Brit Alternative ( well alternative in 1979 ) band Squeeze.   Did the RT and got a message from HOB, \" you've won' . Cool. So Friday night and I'm freeloading at HOB in Mandalay Bay. What a cool venue, it's all standing, aside from a handful of VIP seats, and a great place to watch a real band.  There are a couple of bars and steps down to the floor, sound is great and you cannot fail to get a good view from anywhere. I ordered  a Heineken and a Chardonnay for wifee. The Heineken came in a can which was enormous , almost a keg and the wine came in a tiny plastic 'glass'. I was happy, wifee not so much!   Anyway the band were awesome, Glenn Tilbrook is now sporting a beard that would not be out of place in ZZ Top and Chris and the other players were tight.   Great place I will make more effort to see some shows there, the only downside was $21 for a beer and a splash of Chardonnay."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, felt bluesy ;) But for real, I liked the simple menu- good food and something for everyone. Our waitress, Lisa, was on top of it and patient when we took awhile to look at the menu and decide what we wanted. The margherita flatbread, Mac and cheese and tacos were my favorite. All in all- Coming back again is in my future."}
{"text":"I would give this venue negative stars if I could.  This is just for the main concert venue, not the restaurant, by the way.  First off, the sight lines are absolutely awful.  If you're not on the (very small) main floor or in the balcony it's almost impossible to see the stage due to the very low ceilings.  I didn't spend $30+ on tickets to watch a show on the television, thank you very much, and I don't really want to be packed in like a sardine on the tiny floor.  And since the ceiling is so low, the sound gets extremely compressed.  It's terrible.  This is supposed to be one of the trademark music venues for Cleveland, and to have such basic flaws in the design of the venue is inexcusable.  It's simply a terrible setup for a music venue.  After that add on the worst security I've ever had to deal with at a venue.  I am a writer and often have press and photo passes.  At one particular show I was taking pictures in an area reserved for photographers with my photo pass.  A security guard grabbed me and yelled \"Either you get out or I'm throwing you out.\"  He was extremely aggressive.  This is not uncommon.  I've been to over a hundred concert venues around the country and this House of Blues is probably consistently the worst with security being heavy handed for absolutely no reason.  After all of that, the drink prices are crazy, the attendants in the bathroom get mad if you don't tip them for handing you a paper towel (which I never asked you to get for me), there's no dedicated area for smokers (I'm not a smoker but I have friends that are, you have to leave the venue to smoke), and on and on and on.  I can't think of a single redeeming factor for this venue.  I wish that artists that cared about their fans would stop performing there and go to one of the other great venues in Cleveland.  Unless there's a show you're absolutely dying to see, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Saw the M*F* Darkness here last month. INCREDIBLE SHOW.  The security was great, effective but not overbearing. I wish they would have opened up the second floor. Beers were priced well ($6 for a tall coors).   I also noticed the house of blues attracts the local crowd. It was nice to get away from the plastic surgery creatures and drunken bachelorette parties."}
{"text":"[pic added]  i've been to HOB a lot of times in LA but this is my first time in LV. we went here for the gospel brunch, which is an all-you-can eat buffet accompanied by live gospel music. lemme tell you: i love gospel music. i don't know why, exactly, but i love the energy and soulfulness!  their waffle and pancake station was great. the mini-waffles are my all-time favorite of the meal. mmm, pair it up with fried chicken and it's a match made in heaven. especially if the chicken is all you can eat AND positioned strategically between the cheesy grits and old bay boiled shrimp! those were the real stars of the brunch in regards to savory food. they also have meat carving stations (this time it was smoked turkey and marinated flank steak), a dessert station, build-your-own bloody marys, unlimited bellinis and mimosas/beer (sorry, didn't partake).  entertainment was fun and touching. st. paul's children choir performed and their voices carried strong. coupled with the energy and audience participation, this event turned out very well."}
{"text":"Dinner at the House of Blues nearly inspired me to sing the blues.   If I had a mic and harmonica I'd sing you a woeful tune about the ahi tuna appetizer. Tiny, bland and overpriced.  The St. Louis ribs that featured more inedible gristle than meat.  The redeeming factors that push the review from 1 to 3 stars would be the great service and music we enjoyed during our visit.  Next time I'll go back for drinks and a show, but I'll eat my food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The live music is awesome! We got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. Very very good. A lot of restaurants fail at this dip but not the case here. I ordered the linguine primavera which was honestly a little bland but not horrible. My husband enjoyed his grilled chicken but his carrots were slightly undercooked. All in all great service, great atmosphere and we will return next time we visit Vegas.  As a bonus you receive 10% off in the gift shop area if you spent $30 or more in the restaurant. I don't know if this is always the case but that's a nice little perk. The shop has some pretty fun stuff!"}
{"text":"This review is mostly for the restaurant.  We came here for dinner because we scored free tix to a Brazilian Party at the concert venue, and we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate for the restaurant.  I'd love to be able to give the restaurant 3 1/2 stars, but the service and management was so exceptional that I'm bumping it up to 4.    We were two couples, and it turned out that we all decided to order the same thing, the Turkey Burger.  One of our friends is allergic to tomatoes, and told the waitress that they absolutely had to be left off.  We waited quite a while for our food to be delivered, and even though we'd gotten to the restaurant with time to spare before the concert, we were getting nervous.  When the food was delivered, you guessed it, the tomatoes were sitting on his burger, and it needed to be sent back.  The waitress was completely apologetic and stated that she absolutely told that to the kitchen.  We believed her, and it didn't take too much time for his food to come back, this time prepared correctly.  We all agreed that it was the best turkey burger any of us had ever eaten; no gamy taste whatsoever, and it had stuff mixed into the meat.  It was a little bit spicy - a good thing!  It kicked up the blandness of the usual turkey burger, without the kitchen having to oversalt it to give it some taste.  The fries that came with it were crisp and delicious, and there was a little dish of sweet and spicy pickles, something I'd never tasted before, and really loved.  What happened next was totally unexpected:  the manager came over, unbidden, and apologized for the mix-up.  He invited us to come back after the performance and enjoy dessert on the house.  And then the charge for the Mistake Burger was removed from the bill!  And that's in addition to the discount from the certificate we had.  The performance was a whole 'nother matter.  After being searched and branded, er, banded, we went upstairs where we were ushered to comfortable seats.  No standing room for us, with our free tickets!  A DJ on the stage was playing some Trance-type music.  I normally like this stuff, but I was waiting for \"Brazilian\" to start.  8:30, 9:00, 9:30, nothing except that DJ and a lot of heavy bass.  Nobody downstairs seemed to be moving to it, and I, who normally can't sit still when rhythm is happening, was getting completely bored.  The girl next to me said the show was going to start at 10, even though our tickets said 8:30.  When 10 pm came and went, and nothing changed on the stage, we all decided that dessert would be much more interesting.  We returned to the restaurant, where our same waitress cheerfully served us delicious Key Lime pie, coffee and tea, and no bill save for the tip we left her, and we left sated and happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the St. Louis Rib and the Southern Fried Chicken and they were both okay.   The chicken was 'semi boneless' which meant only a small bone in one of the two pieces. Crispy crust and moist on the inside.   The crushed potatoes were good. Not quite mashed, kind of a baked potato texture.   The wait wasn't that long and the food came out right away. The atmosphere was lively and buzzing with people for a Wednesday night. The live band was a surprise bonus.   Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Suzie Q is amazing,  u have a valuable asset.  What an amazing bartender....  I will be back for sure....."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was decent - too much onion in the gravy over biscuits, and a pancake that was a bit mealy inside. Service was admirable and the place is iconic. I would venture here again for lunch or dinner because I love their cornbread, but breakfast may find me somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Our Server Jasmine was great! Our latest trip here was a little dicey but this trip was amazing. Thank you for a great meal and great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with my in-laws. House of Blues is conveniently located inside of the Mandalay Bay Casino floor, the exterior or HOB is very beautiful, decorated with a musical theme since they do have a concert area, aside from a restaurant and some designs made out of bottle caps. Very nicely done.  You need to be seated by their hostesses, when you walk into HOB you will enter their gift shop section first before being introduced to they restaurant area. Which had a nice dark and interesting atmosphere,  with a huge false tree structure covered with lamps. There were glass colored windows and a bar inside. Their bathroom was also filled with art paintings, the women's stall made out of an old classic truck bed metal (reminds me of my childhood in Hawaii) it was very creative.  For appetizers we started off with steak tacos, it was very tasty and at the same time healthy. For our main course I ordered Shrimp and Grit which was perfect, the grit melted in my mouth, it came with jumbo shrimp and the sauce that came with it was very delicious and went along with the grit perfectly. My husband had Mac and cheese with lobster which was good also, we were expecting a whole lobster, but this dish came with the lobster pieces that came inside the macaroni in cheese, it was still delicious. The kids had chicken tenders with fries, the grandparents said the \"this is really good chicken!\" So, I'll believe that. Our server was cute and informative, and so were every employee there, everyone looked young and good looking, must be, a must to work here. I have brothers and a step dad that bartend/ed and served here. Hehe  We didn't have room for desert as to we were all surprisingly full, the portions looked little but don't let it fool you. I'm 8 months pregnant and was very full, my husband told me I waddle, well after this dinner, I waddled more.  This place is great for dates, family dinners and date with friends; Especially if you're a local, if you want to hit the town, if you kind of want to go into the strip, but not really? Mandalay Bay is the first Hotel/Casino you hit, when entering the strip, South of Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"On another solo work trip the House of Blues affords something to listen and look at while eating slightly above average Southern food. Lineup never fails to entertain and space at the bar is almost always available though sightlines to stage can be a challenge."}
{"text":"We loved the place, the food and the service.  Great ambiance.  We Will recommend and we will come back!"}
{"text":"Went on 1/18/18 for Stick Figure show. For being a corporate place it wasn't too bad, somewhat cheesy. There was a lot of room and plenty of bar space to get drinks fairly easily. Prices on drinks were basically what you would expect for a place like this, I think I paid 8 bucks for jack. Maybe that price is a bit high but I guess  for corporate greed it could be worse. Security was quick to get through and the ones I saw and dealt with were professional and didn't go out of their way to make getting in miserable. The only reason for the two stars is that the sound was absolutely terrible and the sight lines pretty much suck too. There was this constant rattle and crackle coming from the right side of what I'm pretty sure were the house speakers. It was so noticeable that it completely ruined the show for me and many of the people around me who were talking about the same thing. I was standing in the balcony and also had friends who were standing downstairs and another group of friends who were stage front and they all said the same thing. I've seen this particular band at the beachland a few years ago and the sound was absolutely perfect. You would think they could use some of that drink money on some new sound equipment or a new sound tech, not really sure what the problem was but it was bad. I drove over 2 hours to this venue but next time a band that I really want to see comes through this venue I'm going to skip it. Hopefully I can see whoever it is in my hometown but if not I'd road trip somewhere else besides the HOB."}
{"text":"First time at House of Blues, Vegas edition.  Was brought here for a Steel Panther show by a Steel Panther lover.  I'll focus on the venue and not get distracted by the major girl fight that occurred... which was quickly ushered off the stage (go bouncers, go!).  PS - the bouncer right in front is huge.  Don't you dare think of climbing on stage.    The main floor appeared mostly packed, so we chose a spot right behind the railing by the upper bar.  View was good - a bit confused by the VIP (maybe?) area behind the sound booth where a few people were hanging out.  Sound quality was a bit muffled, but maybe I just had a hard time understanding the lyrics and the banter onstage.  Still, it wasn't the most superb.  I spotted two bars, one close behind where I stood... there was plenty of room for purchasers at the bar and the crowd watching the show from the higher level; the second bar was on the left side of the room.  Both bars were extremely overpriced considering the liquor prices in Vegas, so I opted out.    *Shows:  The upcoming band lineup looked great.  I'd definitely consider  a late night concert in Vegas easily.    *Location :  Easy to find in Mandalay Bay  *Parking:  A cinch.  Vegas is good for parking.  Free self-parking all over the place!    *Price:  Seemed reasonable (~$20).  If you were local to LV, you could get into the Steel Panther show I saw at HOB for free.  And who said there's no such thing as a free show?  It exists here."}
{"text":"Took an hour to get our food and did not even have silverware until after we got our food. It was not busy.   Two stars because the manager compensated us greatly for the inconvenience. Food was good one we got it and the manager hooked us up afterwards."}
{"text":"I come to the House of Blues for concerts all the time! This time, I tried out the restaurant and it was awesome. I can't believe I've yet to eat there. I actually just had the tacos, and they were actually one of the best tacos I've ever had for an American bar. I got the fish tacos and the steak tacos. I highly recommend it! The service was great too! The food came out in good timing too! Make sure you stop by for some food before the concert!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was reminded why I like this place so much. Angel was my server today and he was always smiling and kept my coffee tipped off.  I am only rarely in Las Vegas, but when I am, here is where I will eat breakfast.  Wink"}
{"text":"HOB is one of my favorite concert venues in Cleveland.  They host some great cover bands as well as some shockingly bigger name bands.  It's great because you can get right up to the stage and rock out with your favorite music.  Their beer is a bit over priced, but better than your average concert venue.  And tallboy PBR??  What could be better??"}
{"text":"We went here with a group of friends. The food was decent, nothing special. The service was very slow and it took over 30 minutes just to get our bill. Then the waitress disappeared again. We also got charged the entertainment tax. There was a singer there but we were seated in a different room where we couldn't even see the entertainment. I think it's unfair to charge for the tax when we couldn't even enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"First of all, if there were halves, I'd give this place 4 1/2 stars. Staff was friendly (maybe it was because I was by myself and they felt sorry for me). I started off with a Coors light and a half (haha) when they brought out my steak salad. Steak pieces were perfect. I ordered it medium well, but they had it medium. Delicious. Salad was great! Except the avocados that came on it. It tasted like it was a day old avocado. A little too ripe with some browning (but then again, it was very dim in there- so who knows). Staff was nice and salad was good. Try it out."}
{"text":"Been here many times for concerts and also because friends throw fundraisers here. There a few distinct rooms which separate themselves by theme and décor depending on what your business is there. Most of my HOB time is in the main hall for parties and concerts. Make sure you pre game the beers are a whopping $10 each. Bar lines are not horrendous, the place is small enough to good bands to play with a standing room below and seating above. Upstairs in the foundation room is a smaller bar/DJ place with a few meditarranean royalty style VIP rooms. There's also a restaurant downstairs but have never indulged. If you plan to buy tickets for a show here, recommend coming here to purchase tickets, you end up saving like 10-15 bucks on service fees when pay online or on phone."}
{"text":"I've been to several events here and never been treated so rude as i was yesterday.  My daughter and I arrived about 2:45 for the 12 Days of Giving event.  She was to perform 4:30- 5:30 but we wanted to see other friends perform.    When we arrived the lady asked if we would be dining and I said yes.  We also need a table for 4 as friends would be joining.  When we sat down the waitress came over and gave us menus.  I said we would be waiting for our friends to arrive before ordering.  About 15 minutes later our friends arrived.    The waitress asked if we were ready to order.  No not yet they literally just sat down.  A little bit later a woman who I presume was the manager came over and told us if we didn't order we had to move.  Ok first of all the rest of our table had just arrived a few minutes before.  I explained to her we were going to order but just not yet.  She was extremely rude and said again if you don't eat you have to move.  I explained AGAIN we are going to eat quit rushing us!  Wow!  We were mortified!  She said they needed it for reservations.  There was- at any given time 3-5 available tables.  At no time were they all full.  Busy but never full.    Any how we ordered food and it was subpar.  My friends gumbo looked more like dog food and was not even edible.  During that time our daughters were performing on stage.  They KNEW we had 2 other people at the table but moved together 2 tables for a party of 8 that was so close to ours my daughter could not even sit down after coming off stage.    Then a different waiter came over and said it was shift change and he had our check.  Well a) we specifically asked for separate checks and b) I still planned on ordering for my kid so was not ready to close out my bill!  He was very nice and I definitely do not blame him for the mixup.    Anyhow we were leaving soon and someone put a \"reserved\" tag on the table.  Again with the rushing!  Sad to say that unless my daughter has another event there I will not be back.  It's sad because I actually liked this venue but this was the rudest thing I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"* We used restaurant.com gift certificate for lunch.  * I had the steak salad and it was just ok.  * I wished we went to the Gospel brunch instead of just the regular restaurant area.  * I think this place is better for dinner than lunch fare. I think it will be more lively :)."}
