{"text":"Awful customer service. Just this week, I was hung up on by a \"manager\". I live 3.1 miles from the store (according to their website). My house is located on an old road that apparently doesn't come up in their computer system, literally an 8 minute drive away. I work in the service industry, I'm an easy customer. I'm generous to their drivers, polite and simple on the phone; I was actually a regular customer of theirs. Complaining about local restaurants is not my thing, that being said, I've never been hung up on for trying to order a pizza. The young kid I talked to on the phone delivered pizza to my house multiple times, and understood my frustration, but was unable to assist because his brilliant manager, Michelle, forbade him. I tried being civil about the situation. I even contacted Marco's corporate to try to get this stupid computer error fixed. Who wants to order a pizza and feel like their doing something wrong, or like I'm some criminal? It's absurd. After zero response from Marco's Corp., I guess it's a lost cause. Marco's got their wish, and they don't have me as a customer anymore. My advice to you, if you should be so bold as to request a delivery, don't bother if you live 3.2 miles away...or 9 minutes from their store. If you are lucky enough to live within that distance, just hope you don't have to deal with the \"manager\", Michelle. There's a good chance she will make you feel just about as unwanted as you can make a customer feel...and then hang up on you. Don't waste your time with this place. I'm sorry I spent this much time on trying to fix a problem that wasn't mine to begin with."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Nothing to rave over yet not bad either. Very friendly however, their website wont allow you to use the Entertainment Book coupons even if youre ordering at menu prices."}
{"text":"We order here and got two subs and one bacon pizza. Pizza was ok sauce was a little sweet but over all average but I  ordered a sub with out mayo because of allergies and it came with mayo I called they offered to send out another on I said no they were very apologetic and refunded my card the money for the sub so I say great customer service average food"}
{"text":"This Marco's Pizza has been great with special requests on orders and always being fresh. I normally do not care to leave reviews but I felt compelled to do so because of their consistently on point service."}
{"text":"So, I hadn't had Marco's in a very long time. When we moved to a new home we got a coupon for a free pizza- no strings attached. Well, it must work because it was awesome and made us go back again even though we have to pick it up. I wish I would've gotten the name of the guy working Saturday night because my interaction on the phone with him was awesome! He wasn't \"overboard\" like someone trying to bs through a sale, he was just so friendly and listened to all of my requests and questions. I felt like I was actually talking to a friend! Low and behold- it all came out PERFECT and I'm used to a fast food place managing to ruin a standard taco.... The coupon worked, the customer service was above and beyond and now Marco's will be the first on my list of a place to get a pizza!"}
