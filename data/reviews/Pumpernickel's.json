{"text":"You want cheese EXTRA, you want thing else EXTRA - Pretty much over priced for what you get. It is 5-6$ but you always pay way more because eevrything is EXTRA. I am waiting until they start charging for salt and pepper!!! Brick Lane is 10$ however nothing is extra it is twice the size and just as fresh if nto fresher. I only go to Brick Lane now."}
{"text":"I joined yelp just to review this place.

Service: Worst customer service I have ever seen. Extremely rude staff that clearly hate their job.
Food: looks good but tastes horrible. Not fresh, lacks flavor, extremely overpriced 

Stay away!"}
{"text":"This is fairly close to work, and I thought \"Hey! I havent been in there yet\" (or any other pumpernickel's for that matter, so i can't compare locations). They had a wide variety of lunch options. I got a wrap with roasted chicken with grilled vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, red peppers.. mmm all my favourites). The flavours went together super well and the chicken wasnt dry, which is my pet peeve at most deli/sandwich places.
 It would be even better if they were able to grill my pita-wrap. Its self serve and the line moves quick. Can't complain for $6."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this Pumpernickel's location. They have a nice selection of hot food, which usually changes daily. 

Some examples are chicken pot pie, fish, and meatloaf. You can get a side of salad or veggies, and rice or mashed potatoes. It's a little pricey but usually worth it. It's healthier than many other places in the food court. 

They have a number of staff who have been there for years and are very nice. Service is usually very good, including the older woman who works the cash. 

The one exception is a woman who recently started working there in the last month or two  She's usually in the hot food section. She's not rude, but she's not pleasant. She never smiles and looks bored to be there. Poor customer service upsets me. 

Due to her, I've starting going here less frequently (instead of 5 days per week, I go 3 to 4 days per week). However, I won't abandon it altogether because, overall, I've had a great experience at this place."}
{"text":"Pumpernickel's is definitely one of the better places in this particular food court. The sandwiches are delicious, particularly the BBQ chicken avocado, but a bit too small and expensive for what they are.

They handle the volume of customers very well and the wait times are very short even around noon. Also free WiFi at MaRS."}
{"text":"The place is okay. I went when there was a special for ~$6 for one of their big breakfasts. Two toast, two eggs, sausage, potatoes, bacon. Not a bad deal. 

For what it is, it's fine. If you work nearby and missed breakfast at home, it's a good option. The service could be a little friendlier though. One woman in particular I'll remember, since she practically barked at me asking me how I liked my eggs and toast."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the staff are really demoralised. Anytime I go here the staff seem to be really rude to customers and after 12 they have no interest in really serving customers."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh food, seasoned very lightly yet has just enough of flavours. I come here for breakfast 3 days a week. Their homemade soup is also very amazing, generally I don't drink soup outside as most are full of sodium / frozen / powdered made... This is one of the few places that I'd actually get a soup from"}
{"text":"I've used them to cater to our meetings a few times and I will say they have a good variety of decent tasting food.

I deal with them mainly by email and I appreciate how quick and convenient they've been with me when placing orders.

Unfortunately the delivery instructions with my most recent order were ignored despite being the same as always and confirmed the day before.  As a result, the meeting was not catered to as planned.  

I spoke with the manager who I felt was quick to make excuses and completely unwilling to accept any kind of responsibility for the error of his staff.  This was disappointing especially given the fact that I've ordered from them a number of times and would have continued to do so had this been handled differently."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and got two tiny pieces of avocado, very thinly sliced (about the size of two quarters side by side) and the avocado was hard as rock.  Definitely not worth the money and will not go back again as I feel it is misleading to tell customers there is avocado in their sandwich when there is so little and it is inedible anyway.  Very disappointing - you can get much better quality sandwiches anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the salads as that's all I get there. The value is okay, although on a pricier side. The food is too salty for my liking in general."}
{"text":"This review is only for the salad bar as I have not tried anything else. The salad selections are fresh, tasty and there is a wide variety of healthy options. 
However, their service and policies are terrible. 

They are very reluctant to fill your box, even though you pay per box. On several occasions, I ask for an extra scoop of a certain item because I like it, and they claim that it is one scoop per customer and if I want an extra scoop, it is $1.75. What if I only wanted one item in the entire box, are you saying I get one measly scoop in a large box? That makes no sense. I'm not asking that they push down my items to pack it in. But when I pay for a box, I would like it to be full, not just 3/4 full. I don't understand why they are so cheap, the regular size already comes to $9 and this is a salad, why so much attitude for an extra scoop? They should charge by weight if this business model doesn't work for them."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this food court location today. The location is a good one - it has it's own tables so you can avoid the hunt for a table at the TD Centre food court (it can be a challenge).

Today I ordered a \"made to order\" tuna sandwich. Pretty simple. I order them \"made to order\" so that it will actually be made in front of me fresh and I can have some say as to what goes in it. The woman who took my order proceeded to make the sandwich at the back counter without bothering to ask what I wanted on it. I had to yell across to her to add cuccumbers - she wasn't all that impressed with my request, but proceeded to unwrap the sandwich to add them.

When I got to my seat all ready to dig in, I discovered that she had COATED the bread in some terrible mayo-like thousand island-ish dressing. Really? Is this a standard addition to tuna sandwiches? Maybe in the pre-made sandwich, but at least ask me since I'm standing 5 feet away...Disappointing."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place for lunch if I \"wanted to get full\" and full I was, for the rest of the afternoon and evening until dinner! Generous amount of food for a very reasonable price.  Excellent choice for lunch in the downtown area.

The line can get long, but it moves pretty fast. 

I got the plentiful salad.  Essentially, you can get a small or a regular - I got the regular.  They have so, soooo many options of different salads, beans, starches, etc for you to choose from and you can pack as much in your bowl as they will let you.  If you want more of something, I'd suggest you pick it first and tell them to give you extra so you know you'll have room for it.  My favorite was the tabouli - delicious tabouli!  I mostly got the veggie items and didn't opt to add any protein and it was so much food and I was stuffed.  The one small thing I didn't like were the sriracha or spicy sauce chickpeas - had a weird tangy flavor to it that was a bit strange.

I would come back for lunch for sure."}
{"text":"The soups are really good and the breakfast omelettes are fresh. I love going to pumpernickel for a quick bite in the food court and price is fair."}
{"text":"After merely two visits to the salad bar at Pumpernickel's college, I've decided it as my new go-to place for work lunch. The richness of fresh flavours in their salads had me impressed. I probably haven't tasted enough salads in my life to say this - but how can a salad be so good?
Despite previous comments addressing the portion issue, I personally find that they fill up the box quite well! I guess it could depend on the employee. I was lucky enough to have positive experience both times. On my first visit, the employee even suggested to add more into my box, since \"it's still got some space\". As for the second time, I asked for one scoop of each veggie and ended up getting a heavy salad box with enough portion for two meals. They literally pushed the food down to close the lid - that's how much food i got.
Their low rating on yelp surprised me. The only thing I didn't like was how early they're closing the store - on the website it says \"open until 5pm\", but today at 4:30pm, I cheerfully went downstairs just for their salad, only to find out that the store was already closed.
Salad 5/5
Service 5/5
Early store closure 4/5"}
{"text":"For downtown, the pricing is great.
The food didn't look appealing.  It is more like home cook meal by mom on her bad day.  They do have vegan options.
Service is pretty fast even if there were a long line.  I don't like their salad.  Their soup taste better than it looks.  Go for their entree if you get the chance.  Ambience is OK for team lunch.
I would not back for their food.  I don't miss it.
I might go back for good price.

Overall a good place for lunch in downtown if you are on the budget, but nothing else."}
{"text":"Avoid this place unless you like to eat nothing but meat, cheese and eggs. My company orders all the time for work functions, and I consistently go hungry due to these people sending \"vegan options\" such as a yogurt granola bowl, a sandwich with mayonnaise or simply nothing at all! In this day and age, all I have to say is NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"This place is alright.  I really like their breakfast options and it's good value for money.  The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of a what I believed to be trickery when it came to ordering a grilled roast beef sandwich at lunch.  The display sandwich looked tantalizing and appeared to be filled with a good portion of meat.  The pre-made sandwich that I was given, however, was not the same.  When I went back to my office I noticed that there was only a measly two thin slices of roast beef in the sandwich.  I immediately took it and back and they were nice enough to unquestioningly gave me a another sandwich with more meat but it was annoying having to take it back.  Not sure if Pumpernickel's has a policy of weighing meat to ensure a fair distribution.  If not, they sure need to develop a policy around this!"}
{"text":"I've had sandwiches catered at work events from here and thought it was delicious. High quality, fresh, gourmet ingredients. 

Today was the first time I came for a salad (saw my friend's which looked amazing). They have FANTASTIC SALAD! I got a large with turkey kebab add on, total was $10.25 which is normal for salads and healthy meals downtown. 

Best part is that you can pick whatever the heck you want to fill up the container. I had kale mix, tabbouleh, potato salad, curried chick peas, roasted beets. It's legit gourmet and every component was delicious. 

Service was fast and super friendly. Why does this place have such poor reviews? 

Next time will try my salad with crab cake add on instead. It looks drool worthy, but the last 3 were ordered by the patrons in front of me *sigh*"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Not cheap, you are not getting out of here for under $12 for a complete meal at lunch.  But the quality is good. The salads are fresh and varied. The sandwich (prepared) or custom have a nice selection of toppings with fresh bread. And the hot food is well done with lots of daily changes.  You get what you pay for here.  Still worth it though."}
{"text":"Really odd that the \"Head Office\" location of the Pumpernickel's brand located inside the office towers at the corner of Bloor and Islington doesn't have a Yelp page with reviews. Maybe this is due to the fact that it's buried deep inside the lobby of this maze of buildings, either way, coming upon it was like a mirage in the midst of a concrete desert.

I haven't been to a Pumpernickel's since the days when venturing into the PATH was the only way to get food when working downtown. Since those previous visits, I've noticed that the brand appears to have had a refresh and the menu appears to be even more healthy conscious (and increasingly easy to read). 

It's a simple process, walk up, choose between a salad, sandwich or a freshly carved meat sandwich (or soups). I wanted to salad with some protein, of which there are two options 1) a small which comes with 2 salad bar options or 2) a regular size with unlimited options (basically until the bowl is full). It's not even a question that a large is the way to go, even if you're not going to eat it all now the cost to volume ratio is far more in your best interest to go big.

I went with the large, added kale salad, lentil salad, couscous, beat salad and topped it off with a terriyaki salmon filet for an extra cost. Wow, what a power punch of vitamins and flavour! I actually felt myself get energised as I ate it and the although each salad had it's own flavour profile, the medly of them all in the bowl worked together fantastically.

I was really tempted by the freshly carved roast beef option, I think I'll save that for my next visit

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"On several occasions I have found their quinoa salad to be gritty (indicating the ingredients were not cleaned properly), and just recently I found shards of plastic in my salad..."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. It has a great salad bar with lots of options for a quick and healthy lunch. The large salad (no meat) comes to $8.97 with tax and I found it very filling even without any meat. They let you choose as many salads as you want and I thought the bowl was filled fairly (some other reviews said it wasn't filled all the way). I've come here twice now and each time found that the salads had lot of flavour and the service was quick, efficient, and friendly. The sandwiches and other meal options look good but a bit on the expensive side so I haven't tried anything else there and will probably stick to the salad bar. This will probably be my go-to take out lunch now."}
{"text":"food is actually pretty good, but overpriced though.  Staff sometimes are rude, they often appear to be tired and just wanna finish their work earlier. Hardly see smile on their face."}
{"text":"A good spot for lunch in the Financial district. They use fresh ingredients and you can get healthy selections.

Salads are excellent and offer great value. You can choose S, M and L and pick from multiple salad selections - Bean, pasta, couscous, lentil, Beat, etc. They stuff the container with your choices so you get your moneys worth. You can also add fresh chicken breast (I love the BBQ one), smoked salmon or various kebabs. 

I really enjoy their sandwiches. You can get real Chicken or Turkey breast - not the processed kind. Choose from about 6-7 kinds of bread as well. Although I never tried it, lot's of people get the Schnitzel sandwich which is massive.  It's not a healthy choice but it looks really good.

They also serve comfort food which changes daily. Beef, potatoes, veggies and gravy, Sheppard's Pie etc. Never tried these options but they all looks good, and appear to be freshly made.

Pumpernickels is pricier relative to other food court options but I find the food is generally fresher and much healthier - so I don't mind paying a little more.

Service can be hit or miss though. The salads section moves quickly but the sandwich counter is always slow and in chaos. I have stood there waiting many times (and over the period of 2-3 years) while the staff pretends not to see me (including the manager). After a detailed staff discussion, someone eventually comes over. I'm taking away a star for this (and maybe I should take away two).

{"text":"I have used Pumpernickels to cater office events for almost 2 years now.  I love love love this place because they make me look good when I put on an event!  I am not one to use the words \"always\" or \"never\" but their food is ALWAYS fresh and on time - most times early, and they have a great selection.  I can completely rely on Sadbry or Minty to take my order and there will never be anyting wrong with the food or the invoicing.  

When callihg to place an order, Sadbry always has a big welcoming hello that makes me feel like one of his kids who hasn't called home for awhile.  

I highly recommend their baby burgers, any of their salads and their amazing gourmet sandwiches.  Actually, almost everything they have is great but those are my personal faves."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I got to try Pumpernickel's catered sandwiches from a company lunch. I usually don't get sandwiches for lunch because most sandwiches I've tried from other delis tend to be very dry and flavourless. But that's not the case here with Pumpernickel's sandwiches, they are so tasty! I tried both of the Genoa Salami and Roasted Turkey Brie. I love the spices and sauces that were added to them. They make impeccable flavours! And the spicy chick peas salad was delicious! It had a good kick with no awful aftertaste. I enjoyed it a lot. Now I'm tempted to check the restaurant out in person."}
{"text":"I come here religiously at least once a week for lunch. I've been in love with their salad boxes since I discovered them. They've increased the prices so it used to be a steal, but it's still not a bad deal for lunch in the financial district. You get to pick whatever you want from all the salads they have. It ranges from kale to spinach to potatoes to pasta to beets and many other grains. They'll pile on whatever you want until the box is full so no worries about weight here. You can add protein like chicken or salmon, but those are extra costs. The BBQ chicken and teriyaki salmon are THE best choices i"}
{"text":"My office uses Pumpernickels to cater meetings.  Their food is just ok.  I will give them points for having a wide selection of salad offerings.  Were I have issue with them is with their prices and customer service.  $7.00 for a tiny scoop of tuna over a cup of salad??!! Staff seem to barely tolerate serving you that is made clear in their body language and the constant scowl on their faces--they must really hate their job.  Cashier/Manager is loud and abrasive--never smiles, never says thank you."}
{"text":"Great food, if a little pricey (it's downtown so that's to be expected).  I've been eating here for decades. However, there is a woman who works there who is incredibly rude, and if I see her, I won't eat there. She works far too fast. Slaps sandwiches together. Throws food into the salad bowls. She does not listen to customers and therefore frequently makes mistakes, however, if you ask her to correct something, she gets angry and argues. I don't know why she still has a job. I just want lunch - hold the side order of attitude and condescension."}
{"text":"Awful service. The front line workers were very rude, esp. an Asian female who seemed to not want to be at work. I will never eat here again. Money not well spent. The food was good but the service left a bitter taste."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great staff! My personal favourite is the couscous salad with the cajun chicken. Everything is always so fresh."}
{"text":"The people that work here are rude, or just have a bad attitude. They will, very obviously, roll their eyes at you, if they mess up and you tell them. (They mess up orders a lot)  The food is meh and overpriced. Last time i was there i saw a cockroach by the registar. Just overall not a great  place.  There is way better in the area."}
{"text":"It's alright... I mean nothing too special and it's overpriced. If I didn't bring my lunch and have to grab something quick and \"healthy\", pumpernickel would be my choice. 

The small salad itself is not too expensive, you can get two choices of salad. However, if you add a protein (salmon, chicken, etc), I think the total was over $10. I just don't think it's worth it with the price that I paid."}
{"text":"2.5 stars ** 

Nothing really wow'd me about this place. They didn't have much of a selection for sandwiches by the time I ordered (around 2:30 p.m. on a monday) which confused me. Why have a huge menu when you are only going to sell pre-made stuff and not make it fresh on the spot (or at least be able to upon customer request)? The menu sounds really good but I guess there isnt much of a point to it when you could only order the already prepared food in front of you. For this reason, I opted for a salad or rather, mixture of 3 with a piece of salmon on top. It was honestly hard to come up with 3 I wanted because none looked extra appealing. Half way through packing my little brown bowl, the lady behind the counter decides to ask me if it's for here or to go. When I said for here she said I should have told her because she would have given me a plate. Confused again. Why wouldn't you have asked me that before showing me the sizes of the to go boxes and have me choose one? This is my first time here, how do i know these salads aren't always served in a cardboard bowl?

Anywho, it came out to $16, the taste was actually much better than it looked which was an added bonus I could be happy about, I left full and not bloated and I like the touch of being able to pour yourself a glass of water. I may be back if I just so happen to stumble upon one of these places again like I did today but let's just say I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This pumpernickel is one of the worse ones I have been to. I usually go to the pumpernickel in First Canadian Place, for the same price they really pack it in and fill up your box. However this location is very stingy on the fillings, my box was only 3/4 full by the end. I will not be coming back, I hope the owner will correct this because this is ruining the pumpernickel brand!"}
{"text":"Decent food let down by totally rubbish service. Went for lunch and BEWARE if you ask for anything that deviates from the exact menu. Actually, even on menu stuff the staff seem to be confused by. I wanted a greek chicken wrap minus feta and despite asking multiple times the staff put a lot of feta on the wrap. The person I was with wanted the Mediterranean sandwich minus the egg and what she got was a bog standard lettuce sand which with mayo...the staff just couldn't understand us. The one turned round to see if there was such a thing as a \"Mediterranean\" sandwich on the menu, which there obviously was since we saw it and ordered it! The staff at the checkout looked and sounded utterly fed up and served us with about as much enthusiasm as someone going to have their wisdom teeth extracted. Oh and they had also run out of bagels by noon. There are plenty of decent spots to eat around here, my advice is to go to them and steer well clear of this place."}
{"text":"I usually have good experiences here but today I was pretty disgusted at finding old dried up roast beef in a chocolate banana bread loaf that I was eating.

I told the manager and she seemed pretty unphased and unapologetic. I was given a refund but would have liked a bit more reassurance as to how they would do better next time.

It seemed I was just a huge inconvenience for mentioning it.

Won't be returning."}

all the employees looked freakin miserable...would never go back"}
{"text":"The Pumpernickel's in the MaRS food court embodies the phrase \"service with a smile.\" Every time I grab lunch here (which is rather often), the people that work there are super friendly and welcoming. The salad \"bar\" (not self-service, you just point at the items you want and they spoon it into your bowl of desired size) is great, as are their daily soups. You can eat your food amongst the hoi polloi at one of the adjoining food court tables, or if it's sunny, take the escalator upstairs to the outdoor atrium. Or, if you're a loser like me, you grab your stuff to go and eat in front of your work computer while catching up on Reddit. Either way, you're going to have a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Major con = inconvenient hours. This location (and most I believe) is closed all weekend and open only from 7AM-4PM on weekdays. By 2PM they start wrapping up lunch selections, i.e. goodbye salad bar. But if you come right around 10:30-11AM, which is when lunch starts, hardly anything is ready yet. The soup today wasn't ready until after 11 and neither of the options are vegan (potato and leek is vegetarian, but contains dairy). Likewise, the salad bar around 11 today was populated only with carbs - lentils, chickpeas, pasta, couscous, but no greens or beets. Or animal proteins.

Nonetheless, the service is decent, it's fast, and the food is yummy and consistent with other sites across the city.

P.S. $7 = small soup + small salad deal

No wifi :("}
{"text":"Been coming here almost daily for the past week since been too lazy to pack a lunch and snacks during the work week and Pumpernickel's lighter lunch options are starting to grow on me! Pretty affordable if you have a small and plant-based appetite. My favorites have been the yogurt parfait (vanilla non-Greek yogurt, sugar-y granola, topped with wonderfully fresh berries) for $2.50, small soup for around $4 (they have daily vegetarian options, but be warned that since the staff fills your container the soup will consist mostly of liquid rather than solid ingredients), and the small salad (2 choices - quinoa, tabbouleh salad, couscous, lentils, etc) for around $5. Animal proteins are more expensive, e.g. salmon + sides is around $15. Whole fruits here are $1 per apple or banana. 

Tip- consider walking 1 block east to Sobeys or Metro for their pre-made lunch options (e.g. $8 salmon with sides at Sobeys vs. $15 at Pumpernickel's) and cheaper fruit by the pound."}
{"text":"Go to the Simcoe Place location instead. This location gives smaller portions and not as friendly staff"}
{"text":"Working downtown its hard to find good fresh and fast food.
This is the place people.  The schnitzel sandwich is mouth watering orgasmic.  On Fridays they do a fish and chips, its always fresh, perfectly battered, light and crispy.  Other dishes are decent as well.  Some of their salads are stupid.  Kale to me is the dumbest veggie on earth.  Its like eating flavourless weeds.  Why not just eat your napkin instead, it has more flavour."}
{"text":"When I saw that Pumpernickel's had a BBQ chicken avocado sandwich, I was SO excited to try it. As I told my friend who was in line with me: Avocado and BBQ are two of my favourite things - I can never say no to avocado toast or barbeque pork buns. This must be a match made in heaven... right? 

I couldn't have been more wrong. The combination of BBQ chicken and avocado was just absurd. The flavours meshed into something indistinguishable; I couldn't enjoy either one. Perhaps I should have just taken the sandwich apart so I could have had the BBQ chicken and avocado separately. After my last bite, I headed back to work, sad and slightly queasy.

However, I've heard great things about Pumpernickel salads and I might change my review after trying that."}

{"text":"Average at best. The staff really rushed me to order and was not listening to what I asked.

Definitely better places to get your breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok -- I have not been here for years -- but was back this week to meet with friends.

You can get all kinds of sandwiches, plus some hot entrees and a good selection of salads, most made to order.

I have to say that my fav thing here continues to be the Schnitzel sandwich (your choice of white or whole wheat hoagie) - comes with roasted peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato etc.  Always a very generous piece of schnitzel and made fresh to order.  Still one of the best sandwiches in the tower.

There are only a few tables in this spot as it borders the food court, so is best for take out or eating in the main part of the food court"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and a large and tasty variety in their salad bar selection! Ditch the soup though; had salmon \"bisque\" that was more like shreds of canned fish in tomato broth."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch, Pumpernickel's is another winner. While the sandwiches and soups here are really good, the salad bar option here is solid. Alternating with Est West (see other review), these two places form the foundation for some solid lunches.

There are three sizes available for the salad bar: small, medium and large. Since these are primarily grain salads, a medium is more than enough for lunch.

Options include: couscous, a couple rices, grains I can't identify (maybe quinoa, maybe lentils), black beans/corn, chickpeas, coleslaw, cold pastas, and if you're lucky, some awesome tabouli. This alone is a heavy meal, but if you want you can add chicken to it.

The medium salad without chicken is $6.50 including tax.

Note: the MaRS building has some great lunch spots, but don't neglect the outdoor atrium, located up the stairs and west of the food court."}
{"text":"In desperate situations, I would go to Pumpernickels but quite frankly, it is a bit of a hit and miss at times.  Here are a review of the things I've had so far: 

 Breakfast sandwiches: The vegetarian version is gross.  The tomato is watery and it ruins the whole breakfast sandwich.  The meat version is decent although their egg is quite dry and there are bits of pesto sometimes (why.....!!!).  

 Salads: Their small salads run you about $10 and if you add protein in a large salad, it can cost you up to $15-20.  They are big salads, granted but not superbly delicious.  

Soups & sandwiches: Again, it's quite expensive for the amount of soup they are offering.  It's $7 for a soup (large) that isn't actually that large.  I could go across to swiss chalet or even Flock and get a better soup. 

Overall, their service is good for the most part.  There is a skinny South East Asian girl with dark red lipstick in the mornings who give you lots of sass.  I asked for a BLT with a fried egg white (and said it in exactly those terms) and she gave lots of attitude about it.  The other time, when I was paying, she asked me if it was credit and I said \"yes\" and she then said, \"Well which one is it...debit or credit?\".  In my head, I was like..uhh pretty sure you just said credit but whatever.  This one needs to work on waking up on the right side of bed or she shouldn't be doing the morning service."}
{"text":"I recently experienced Pumpernickel's catering services for a business lunch and overall, it was 'average' but nothing special. Each individual received a paper bag containing either a vegetarian wrap (grilled vegetables, egg salad or falafel) or a non-vegetarian selection (corned beef sandwich, or grilled chicken wrap), with a side salad selection of mixed greens with balsamic dressing, or a veggie bean salad. Additionally, it included a giant cookie (either chocolate chip or all chocolate) and a bottle of water. There were additional soda beverages as well (although I'm not sure if this was a part of the catering package). 

My individual selection was the grilled veggie wrap, and although the grilled vegetables were great, the wrap was slightly soggy. I had a mixed green salad which was pretty generic and a giant chocolate chip cookie (which was way too big).

The catering staff members were pleasant and on-time.

Overall, for a large group it's a pretty convenient choice; however, for $14/person, it may be a better deal to find a buffet option."}
{"text":"We have ordered from pumpernickels now on several occasions and food is always excellent !  Lots of various salads, roasted chicken, fresh breads and dips. Our team raved about it yesterday. Delivery service also always on time."}
{"text":"Great tuna sandwich and side salad(s). Service was quick. Ingredients seemed fresh. Good flavours. Soft drink selection was limited."}
{"text":"Located in upper food court of First Canadian Place. A very lively, hussle-bussle place to eat, and extremely well designed and definitely higher-class. This place usually has large lineups, and the wait isn't bad. The place is very sanitary, and the food looks pretty attractive too.

I tried their make-a-salad thing twice. Basically theres a large selection of fresh lettuce, corn, pasta, etc. and you just ask them what you want. Don't get a small size though, you only get to pick 2 items for it. 

They are kinda pricey for what you're getting, though. The service is decent for the amount of people they get during lunch.

In terms of eating experience at FCP: it can be hard to find a seat, it is a very loud food court, but the tables are spread out enough so that you can hear people speaking to you. Great place to eat with co-workers : )"}
{"text":"I normally don't review places. But if your going their for lunch and getting the salad, ask for the small. If you ask for the regular, they only fill a quarter of the container. Salad was okay, staff couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I needed to get something for lunch and that fast. I ended up at Pumpernickel and ordered their warm schnitzel sandwich with sauteed onions. The schnitzel was crispy and tender and tasted pretty good. Unfortunately the sauteed onions were bland. It lacked seasoning and was just sweet. All the ingredients combined added up to an OK sandwich, but that's all.  
Considering this is a sandwich off their menu and not a \"build-your-own\" they should have put more thought into how to combine ingredients to make the sandwich a tasty experience. I feel that they failed with that. It is not the worst sandwich but it just didn't wow me either. After trying this sandwich I wished I had gone across the street to TLP which I know always have amazing sandwiches. My tip: go to TLP (Three Little Pigs)!"}

Why does anyone order, and expect, from a catering service?

Convenience
Good food
Saving time
Customer service

They have set up their system so it suits them and not their customer. They sat down and figured what THEY need and how THEY would be happy and how THEY incompetently would profit. That is the entirety of their process.

First, we would have saved time if I had made sandwiches and cold pasta at home the night before or morning of and brought it with me for our function.
Second, the el...something person had a bad phone, which she blamed on my colleague. According to this employee of theirs who answers their corporate number, the line she used which constantly cut out as though she had second calls coming in, was our company's fault. She also sounded like dealing with my coworker was a hassle she didn't need. Then they charged us twice. Once from corporate and once from the local business near our offices. When my coworker called them and asked they told us that 'this is how we do it' (I told you their process is what works for them). Should they have warned us in advance (never mind that they should stop this practice!)? Well, not according to them, they don't care. 
Explanation? Nah, why give that to customers? 
Why did you charge us twice? It is a hold. 
Why do you put x 2 holds on a credit card?? Are you not one company? It will get removed!
Why do we have to call you several times and why could you not tell a customer this before (not to mention a second hold - never mind a hold - is not required in the first place)? Oh well.. Yeah... that is how we do it! 
Could you reverse it? Your bank will do it! 
When? Call your bank, I don't know!!

You see how much a waste of time these people are?

Food? Average.
Quantity? Average?

There are a million catering businesses out there and many of them are grateful, polite and save you time too! Pumpernickle is not into those concepts."}
{"text":"My go to place if I'm looking for a quick lunch in one of the Financial District food courts. 

I'm sure their salads are tasty and healthy (they LOOK good) but I've never eaten one. The only thing I've ever eaten there, going back to the late 1980's is their Schnitzel sandwich. Other than offering a whole wheat bread option now, I don't think the recipe has changed in 30 years, and that's a good thing. 

If you want to blow off the diet for a day and sink your teeth into a deep fried and salty slice of heaven on a bun, try the Schnitzel, you won't regret it. It's stacked with meat like a sandwich is supposed to be. Get it loaded with the onions and if you like spice add some hot peppers. Simple, yummy, salty, and a bit of oil to get you through another tough day in the market."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, I pop in to buy salad. Their selection varies day to day but usually the deli maintains their coleslaw, couscous/lentils and kale, which are by far the most delicious. You get four choices with the option of paying extra for additional selections. Expect to pay between $8 and $12 for the large bowl. Lasts for 2 days."}
{"text":"When I need to detox from eating too much meat, this is where you will find me. 

I go straight to their salad bar where you get to choose from 18 different types of salads ranging from healthy greens like kale and Spinach, to powerful veggies like broccoli and beets to carb fillers like penne, quinoa, couscous...you get the drift. If you need protein, they offer a variety of meat for a minimum price.  I'm not gonna lie, the chicken and white fish fillet are always calling my name but that defeats the purpose of detoxing so I opt for the chickpea salad instead.

Every salad is so fresh and unique in taste. My favourite is the quinoa with watermelon and feta.  So delicious. 

I'm always full after a bowl of large salad. They charge by size and pile it in until it fills the bowl so you can get any salad your heart desires without having to worry about the weight! Scorrrrre!"}
{"text":"One of the best healthy options for lunch in the core.  They ram pack your package with salads ranging from lentil salad to beet salad, 8, 9 kinds of your choice into one.  And then they top it off with chicken, fish or salmon.  Everything is fresh and good, priced fair with generous portions.  If only they were street level and open all the time, wifey would never cook"}
{"text":"This place is clean and well lit, with lots of seating.  There is a large selection of what appeared to be delicious food and self serve coffee.  I opted for the self serve coffee, which tasted ok, and went into a massive lineup that moved surprisingly well.  It is kind of like a cafeteria with much sturdier and newer furniture."}
{"text":"Good stuff. They have a decent breakfast and the wraps with a small salad is a good deal. I like places that let me build my own... It always turns out the way I like it."}
{"text":"It is my go to lunch place at work.Luckily,I have 2 of them around my office.Once at First Canadian Place and other at the TD Food Court.
Both of them have almost the same selection of salads.
I always get a medium salad.
There is a huge selection of salads to choose from.
You can ask them to add anything from that and as much as you want(of course it should fit your medium sized salad bowl).
I usually get the barley,quinoa,lentils,pasta,chickpea,broccoli,couscous and beets.All these salads are made fresh everyday.
While all the salad selections are vegetarian,you can also get protein or other items added for extra cost.
By paying extra,you can get chicken,crab,falafel,basa,boiled eggs or salmon.
I usually just get the veggie salads but if I do get protein,I ask them to add chicken or basa.
The quantity in a medium salad is a lot and I usually don't feel hungry the entire day after I eat this and sometimes I save it and eat it for dinner.

Veggie salad costs around 8 bucks and if you get protein added the cost will vary depending on the item you add,salmon being the most expensive at 5 bucks.
Overall,a very cost effective and healthy option for lunch and I am a big fan of it."}
{"text":"I tried the Power Up breakfast. It comes with eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon and sausage for $5.99. It's a ton of food for the price which is great. What isn't great is that the food itself is pretty brutal. Other than the eggs, everything else seemed like it had been sitting for a few hours before it made it to my take-out container. The potatoes were cold, the bacon was cold, the sausage looked like a shriveled prune.  Overall just really bad. 

I would suggest getting something else on the breakast menu as the rest seems to be made in front of you when you order it.

{"text":"Not sure what I should say about food in here. I'm not happy with food I ordered. I had rice and fish. No taste and cold plus pricey."}
{"text":"Had the Schnitzel... drools! Lots of fried meat."}
{"text":"Just found out they feature fried chicken every Friday during lunch. It's Pumpernickel's so I expected a good version of fried chicken. Well, it's more like very good. (And the chicken pieces were larger than average.) I was pleasantly surprised. And they serve it with two sides - one choice being mashed potatoes.

My only gripe is that it's a tad pricey - $13 before tax for 2 pieces of chicken and the sides. I kinda like when my lunch is less than 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2
Service ****
Ambience *** (For a food court)

Had a breakfast sandwich here and it was great.  Fresh ingredients and a hot made from scratch omlette (they have eggs too.)

I find the salad bar and sandwiches hit or miss sometimes and noticed at other pumpernickels in the path (underground network in Toronto's business district) to be better.  

Regardless I've found a delicious breakfast spot!"}
