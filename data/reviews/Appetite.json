{"text":"This place is the worst.  The food looks good and tastes like garbage.  There is zero flavour.  Everything is extremely over priced.  The soups are bland.  The sandwiches are awful-- bread is hard as a rock, chicken looks and tastes disgusting... Im not kidding when I say that it is horrible here.  Dont go- its a huge waste of money and you will still be hungry when you leave!"}
{"text":"The food here really is great.  Especially their sandwiches and soup.   It's so nice to pop in and grab something to go.  The service is still a little stiff but I'm willing to overlook it for a warm bowl of steaming soup"}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious salads and comfortable \"designer\" high chairs by the entrance."}
{"text":"I reluctantly give it 3 stars, the food I had was good, but something is lacking here. I felt like I didn't matter to them and the selection of food was weird (hard to put a meal together) and the service just wasn't. Micro-wave seems to be the standard here for re-heat and serve.  I liked what I had, but not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Another iteration of what is sadly becoming a common option in this neighborhood: basic service, desperately mediocre food, bloated prices.  This place basically is a crappier version of what used to be at this address (Loic.) Greatly diminished variety and portions for the same price, and the quality isn't there. Two half-cup servings of deli-case veggie-only slaw salads and a bottle of water ran me $10+  The salads were really the same thing you get out of the deli section at Loblaws. There were two protein options which were naturally more expensive than the meal I had. The \"special,\" which was two chicken fingers (quantity specified) and salmon. The salmon was not indicated on any menu, but I knew it was available because a pile of each option, pre-cooked, sat under the counter. Waiting to be, what, nuked I guess? For your fresh eating pleasure.  It honestly looked sadder than airplane food, an while I have no clue how it tasted, seeing it wrecked any \"Appetite\" for it. Har har.   With several other options on that stretch of street, offering delicious cooked to order options, better portions, table service, better variety - the model here may need to change. Considering that the food at Loic was priced the same - but truly delish - and they didn't survive? Things here will be over pretty quick."}
{"text":"I gave this place five stars before and really enjoyed eating here but since the staff changed over in September it's gone down hill.  My parents noticed the same thing.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"this place is great. Good variety of sandwiches and salads. Nice healthy options. They also have great daily specials and soups. I've been going here at least 3 times a month for quite a while and I have never had a problem with the service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's in my hood and I love to support local businesses.  I have given it three tries which I feel is more than fair; it has completely struck out.  The first time I tried the kale and pomegranate salad.  It had grit in it; maybe the kale hadn't been washed thoroughly enough?  And at $7.50, it was a pricey undertaking for an unappealing small salad.  The second time I tried to get a rotisserie chicken, but was rather rudely informed that they wouldn't be ready for an hour so I had to come back.  It was just before five pm which doesn't strike me as an unreasonable time to want to pick up dinner on route home from work.  Whatever.  The final visit was the kicker.  My girlfriend and I stopped in to grab a salad as a side dish.  The woman behind the counter took her time serving us and stopped midway while getting our salad to discuss some delivery with a fellow employee.  We waited patiently for our Greek salad.  Another $7.50 for a small salad, but the kicker was when we got back to my place, she hadn't even filled the container half way!!!  Weak sauce, Appetite!  I won't be back; in fact, I would advise anyone go to Ruby Eats instead."}
