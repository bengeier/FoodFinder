{"text":"I have been ordering from Bee'z for many years and have always been very happy with the food.  Probably one of the best fish sandwiches in the area.  Great Shrimp and Avocado Wrap and really good salads!  When our office ordered take out last month and I ordered a Salmon Burger.  It was definitely better than expected.  Very flavorful and nice portion.  I actually did away with the bun and ate the salmon.  Then last week my husband and I went and I ordered the Greek Salmon, recommended by the waitress, she doesn't eat fish, but said it is a popular choice among regulars.  It did not disappoint.  It was so good.  It really does rival any of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.  My husband ordered French onion soup a bacon burger.  His soup was good but he said the burger tasted like a frozen burger and didn't care for two patties on a hoagie bun, he would have preferred a fresh made burger on a hamburger bun. Funny that they make a better piece of Salmon then a Burger!  Service is standard.  They seemed overworked and short staffed.  They don't smile a lot.  But since this is a food review - definitely try the Salmon!  That's why I gave it 4 stars!"}

{"text":"One of the places I miss since moving from town. What's not to like here? Really good pizza, awesome salads, and I was a huge fan of the bread sticks.  Not a huge place, but a fair amount of seating.  Definitely would like to stop back when I visit home, and of course, the prices are not bad.  Nice little family restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing was wrong with my meal or experience. I just wasn't \"WOW'd\" by it. Margaritas were delicious though, but the food overall just wasn't anything special. Ordered the buffalo chicken as an app, very basic chicken tenders in buffalo hot sauce... Again, could've made frozen ones that were identical. Wings were okay too, the waitress didn't do the best way of explaining the sauce to us so that might've been to blame. And the pizza was just okay that I got, again nothing special or wow'd just almost a let down. Would possibly go again and order something else, but overall just wasn't impressed but nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I really enjoy all parts of my dining experience while I was there."}
{"text":"Bee'z has good food and a very nice bar. But every time I go there it's packed and never really can decide on what I want to eat. Nothing blows me away. They do have a great fish sandwich that I get during Lent."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite for our family. Cook had to have changed. Always get the pasta with portabella cream sauce but it now has no taste. My family said the food isn't as good. They're right..."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!!! Famil owned and it shows in the pride they take of making sure your vist is nothing lrss than fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Tony Special (Calzone--provolone, mozzarella, and pepperoni).  Service was great.  $6.00, not bad"}
{"text":"I probably go to Beez at least once a week so the least you could say is that I'm a big fan. It's a very popular spot for the locals. They have the restaurant one side and the pub on the other separated by a door. All the servers and hosts are very kind and friendly.

Now for the food: Their chicken wings are amazing - always fresh, warm and juicy. Their salads are huge and always have fresh ingredients. Pizzas are very popular and I can see why the few times I've tried a pizza. The sandwiches and chef's choices are also very good. Never have I walked out of Beez disappointed. I am always stuffed and smiling. If you are in the South Hills area and in the mood for some home cooked style American food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Customer service absolutely horrible.  A handful of us at work placed a large lunch order.  We explained that it was all one order, coming to the same place, but we needed to pay separately.  Not a problem... Until they charged each one of us a $1.50 delivery charge on our credit cards.  One order, being delivered to one location.  It's not even like the driver had to find all of us, he just had to bring food to one person and our building  is less than a mile from Bee'z.  When the \"manager\" was questioned, she said that was how they do things there.  Even though I feel it is completely wrong, it should have been explained to us when we initially called in the first place.  Will never order again nor will anyone in our place of business."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic here and the beer selection is also. They run nice beer specials that are written on a board above the bar.

The servers (not all) have a tendency to get lost at times which is interesting considering it's a smaller establishment."}
{"text":"Okay, read my reviews and you know that I'm a pretty fair and generous reviewer.

That being said...

I would give it ZERO stars if I could.  Waited 15 minutes for someone to stop by our table to take our drink order.  No one arrived.  When we walked out we spoke with the greeter and told her why we were leaving.  A waitress came over IN FRONT of us and asked the server why we were upset.  Greeter said, \"yeah we never went over to their table\" and the LAUGHED at us TO OUR FACE.  The waitress said,\"Oh, again!\" Which brought the other three employees who wandered over to tears of laughter.

I'm so angry I'm still sitting in the parking lot wasting even more of my time writing this so that YOU never waste your time going here."}
{"text":"The place was very busy on a Saturday evening and we had a pleasant experience. The portions were larger than we expected & quite good. Good lasagna, good burger, and the reviews here almost felt like some were fabricated for food wars. Try for yourself, had the most reasonable prices amongst the local eats."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate at Bee'Z Bistro tonight.  We got there at about 5:30 and had an hour wait. This place does a big Friday evening business.  

I ordered the prime rib, broccoli and garden salad and the wife the 5 cheese pizza.  We shared a crab dip.

The prime rib was better then average, the salad average and the broccoli way better then average.  The pizza was very good.  The crab dip just average.  

How do I rate my experience?  I rate the food a 4.  The service a 5.  The facility a 3.  The value of our meal a 4.  So I rated our overall experience a 4.  Will we go back?  Darn right we will to try a few of the items on their big menu that look interesting!"}
{"text":"A nice, low key meal spot in Bridgeville. Servings are pretty generous - I definitely always have leftovers to take home for a second meal. Last time we visited, we got the Jalape√±o Poppers, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, And Spicy Cajun Steak Hoagie. Steak hoagie wasn't spicy, but the sandwich was good - just needed to add a big of sauce to give it some extra flavor! I was a big fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich as well - they gave you four big pieces of nicely prepared buffalo chicken tenders on the sandwich, the usual fixins, and onion rings!

 Prices are super reasonable too, and they have some pretty fun looking drinks! Service is pleasant and although we haven't been here on a super crowded night (we have only come ok Tuesday or Wednesday evenings), there were still a decent number of people around to create a pleasant atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food is always very tasty and portions are huge. A must, try their hamburger or cheeseburgers. We love it, and it's convenient to where we live with free parking."}
{"text":"Before moving to Pittsburgh 5 years ago, I've lived in Chicago, grew up in St. Louis and spend a lot of time in NYC.  All capitals, if different philosophies, of pizza.  The stains on my shirts and dough around my mid-section are physical proof that I'm pizza passionate.  Frankly, I've found the pizza in Pittsburgh plentiful in quantity but rather spotty on quality.

Last night we went to Bee'z for the first time.  It's a little outside our neighborhood.  Wow.  My wife and I, 12-year old daughter, 15-year old son and two of his pals shared a large veggie white pizza and large Rajun Cajun chicken.  Fantastic.  The crust was flavorful and fresh, the toppings were plentiful and consistent.  Service was great (an rarity in the 'burgh IMHO).  We got the pizzas quickly, shortly after we polished off a zuchinni plank starter (also quite good).  The total bill (with a couple Yinglings) and water for everyone was slightly over $40.

I'm looking forward to going back, trying some of their other pies, and see if this was a fluke or I've found my new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"They have consistently been one of the best  Italian bistro's in this area. The pizza and hoagies are my favorite. You can dine in or take  out.  They even deliver they have an extensive  menu so check out their webpage.

{"text":"We went here with another couple and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised!!! 

My first thought was pizza place that has some beers. Nope, I was wrong...The beer selection was outstanding and the food was good. Everything from the homemade potato chips to the fish sandwich. I got the large fish and it was 1 pound of meat on a nice size bun. I was so full that I never got a chance to taste the pizza, however next time that will be my plan. 

I would go here again no doubt! The prices were very inexpensive too....but expected at this place."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience of my life. Received burnt food through delivery then they had attitudes when we called to complain and accused us of just wanting \"free food\". Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving this place 1 star is not so much food quality (although I would say 3 at best for what I had) but is more pertaining to the absence of them to rectify and satisfy a customer complaint.  This restaurant has lost a potential customer.  I eat out a lot and try not to complain but on the rare occasion when I do, I expect that there will at least be an attempt at trying to \"make it right\" by the restaurant.

I had ordered Pasta Marinara and some fried mushrooms for delivery late one night.  The mushroom breading is not great and it came with no sauce.  It wasn't listed on the menu when i checked so I gave this a pass (although I've never run across a restaurant that didn't offer sauce with their fried mushrooms before).  The side salad that came with the pasta actually was the only real bright spot.

The menu online listed the Pasta Marina as \"angel hair pasta topped with homemade marinara sauce and cheese\".  The pasta was definitely not angel hair pasta but regular spaghetti noodles.  The taste was just ok.  It was late and I didn't call about it that night because I was hungry and their delivery was closed by then so I ate a bit of it and decided that I would take to show them the next day, thinking that they should know what is being sent out.

When I took it there the next day, a woman behind the counter said \"it is a misprint in our menu.  I have told the owner several times\"  I told her that I saw it on the online menu (which she admitted might be easier to correct but then just said \"they are working on it\".)  She did apologize but offered nothing to compensate for the fact that I ordered something and didn't get what I was expecting.  

So it is apparently a known issue, was brought up to management \"several times\" and nothing has been done about it or process put in place to let customers who order know that it is not angel hair pasta as stated on the menu.  I wonder how long it has been on the menu this way.

Bad form, bad for business the way this was handled (are the employees not authorized to offer compensation when you don't deliver quality or actually the product that they ordered?).  Since it was a known misprint, someone should have informed me when I ordered and ask if I still wanted it.  

Does the owner care?"}
{"text":"Working in Bridgeville, we go here quite a bit for lunch.  The pizza is excellent, as is the tuna melt and meatball sub (if you're cutting out the breads, have them do the \"bunless\" meatball sub - meatballs baked in a little crock with melted cheese....yummy!). If you like bread, get the homemade breadsticks.  Delish!  I wish there was a little more in the way of variety for lunch specials, but I never leave hungry, and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Came in with my family for dinner and ordered a chicken wrap for myself which was served cold with frozen chicken that tasted worse than a wrap from getgo. Told the server I didn't know it was served cold and her reply was \"yeah\". I heard her tell some lady named Marcy that I didn't want it cold and Marcy yelled it's supposed to be cold. Wow. Rude! And then she brought it back microwaved with my same bite marks in it. Not to mention they charged me for a lemonade for my daughter in addition to a $7 kids meal served with rotten grapes. You'd think it was included. Went to leave and nobody even said goodbye! I'd have had way better food and hospitality at Panera."}
{"text":"My wife, kiddo, and I went here tonight for dinner.  It was fairly packed.  No problem, we can wait...  But once we walked in the hostess said, and I quote, \"it's snowing people... go home!\"  We turned around and walked out, and we will not be back.  I wish I could give them zero stars.  That is NOT how you treat a paying customer... ever."}
{"text":"Such an adorable little place to eat! I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and it wasn't real heavy, but a pretty big portion! It came with a side of chips but of course I ordered a side of fries too!

Our waitress was friendly but I felt like we were rushed out. We were halfway done eating and she brought us boxes while we had absolutely no room on our table and she took our plates without asking if we were finished lol.

Overall, I would come back, hopefully with a different waitress."}
{"text":"Yuk! Nothing fresh. Homemade potato chips...stale. Pizza is frozen dough. A favorite in my area for years. Why?? Not clean. Waitress friendly. Only good thing. Learned my lesson. Ate there 13 yrs ago. Still same poor food."}
{"text":"My uncle and I visited for lunch. We decided to try a plethora of things. We ordered crab dip and pepper jack cheese bites. Both were phenomenal. The pepper jack cheese bites were so creamy and delicious. My uncle tried the crab cakes and holy smokes they were wonderful! I tried a pizza and it was pretty good. I don't remember what it was exactly, but I took a risk and the pizza ended up being too spicy for my liking, but for those who like spice, i'm sure it wouldn't disappoint! Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with some coworkers for lunch.  The menu was what attracted us to this place.  Unfortunately, the food could have been much better.  Onion rings and pepper cheese cubes seemed like they were served from frozen.  Menu indicated that they should have been fried to a crispy golden brown, but when they arrived at our table, they were barely lukewarm.  They were not fried at all, and were more than likely microwaved.  I was excited to try the Turkey & Bacon Hoagie, as the menu touted juicy turkey and crispy bacon.  But the turkey was average-at-best and the bacon was limp.

Service left more to be desired as well.  The waitress only came by to take our drink and food orders and deliver our orders.  I do not recall being asked how our food was.

Unfortunately, Bee'z left a subpar first impression with their lack of decent service and by taking shortcuts in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Everything from Bee'z is awesome, especially the pizza! Definitely the go-to place for dinner/pizza dates."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is VERY slow. I was able to order 1 beer, literally it took about 20 minutes to come.  Also, when you order an Imperial Stout don't just leave the bottle without offering a glass.  We probably would have ordered up to 3 or 4 more beers if our waitress would have ever come back.  :(."}
{"text":"Although I have lived in the area for more than twelve years, this was my first visit to Bee'z Bistro.

This is an attractive, modern, comfortable, casual restaurant situated in a small strip of shops and medical providers.  Although it was reasonably busy on the night that we were there, my wife and I were able to chat without having to yell or fear that our conversation would be overheard by someone that was inches away.

Our server was generally excellent.: friendly, capable, and gracious  The only flaw was that my empty water glass was removed from the table well before I left and not replaced with a refill. She obviously became sidetracked.

The fried zucchini was satisfactory, but it is the standard \"plank\" version, not the delicious, thinly-sliced, long strips offered by a few choice restaurants like Scoglio Greentree.  Bee'z version was fairly-priced at $5.00, the portion being plenty for an appetizer for two.

My mushroom pizza and my wife's vegetable calzone were generally good, but much of the crust of the calzone was raw, not something one expects with a pricey $17 item.

We ordered a lot of food and had some to take home, but our tab came to in excess of $53 with gratuity, a lot for a weekday meal for two.

During our meal, a young man who appears to be the owner, went through the dining room, greeting and chatting with individuals who are obviously regulars.  He stopped at the booths on both sides of ours, ignoring us.  If one is going through the dining room to greet people, might they not have a kind word for those that he does not know as well, hoping that through extending hospitality, they might become regulars? If this were my restaurant, I would be so grateful to those who dined there that I would let them know in some way that their patronage is appreciated and that I would like to see them again.  We have experienced the same type of disdain at DeBlasio's in Mount Lebanon, where it is obvious that only regulars are acknowledged by management.

If Bee'z offered specials that are not exclusive to the bar area, I might dine there with some regularity. The outstanding Primanti Brothers offers happy hour prices in the restaurant, which enables one to enjoy a glass of wine at the dinner hour for the low, low price of $2.38.  Its pizza is better than Bee'z and it offers 20% bonuses on gift cards at holiday time, enabling the diner to enjoy great prices throughout the year if they stock up as I did.

The restaurant offers the means to provide comments through e-mail.  I took the time and effort to provide detailed thoughts six days ago, providing compliments and constructive criticism, and have received no response yet."}
{"text":"Bee'z has great food. Nice atmosphere too.

My recommendation is to order something off of the \"specials\" menu. They always have some good daily options on there. One of my personal favorites is the banana pepper ravioli - it's unique, and delicious!

The servers/bartenders have always been great when I was there."}
{"text":"Used to go to Beez frequently but the service has recently become far too painful. We have waited 45 minutes on several occasions for our food on nights where the place was not full. The food is great and that is what brings us back but at what point does bad service outweigh good food? Best fish sandwich in the area and great salads. Until we see improvements in service we will be eating take out from Beez."}
{"text":"Never going back. Went on a Friday, there was about 6 open tables in the bar all of which had stuff on them (plates, bills, tips, food etc). I asked the waitress that was running around if we could have a table and she rudely told us to seat ourselves as she passed by. We found the table with the least amount of stuff on it and waited and waited for her to serve us. Finally my boyfriend went to the bar to order our drinks and the bartender told us she couldn't serve us only the waitress could. We sat waiting for her to finally come over and take our drinks. Tried ordering 3 different beers off their wall menu none of which were available. Ended up getting the most simple drinks and waited 10 more minutes for her to bring them as they sat on the bar. Terrible service, rude waitress and bartender, won't be giving them anymore of my business when there are plenty of other bars in Bridgeville."}
{"text":"Never again. I always hear that the restaurants in Bridgeville have good food, but the service really lacks. This is all too evident at Beez. I went for a dinner on Friday night with a couple friends and we waited which was fine and expected. While being seated at our table in the bar a waitress rudely told me to get out of her way. Ok...then she meanders over to wait on our table.  The service was painfully slow, rude, and the food was not worth the hassle. My Caesar salad was pretty good, but I would not go through the trouble to ever visit this place again, especially when there are so many other good places to eat.

Food 3/5
Atmosphere 2/5 (cramped and loud)
Service 1/5"}
{"text":"This place is a great local bar and food establishment.  Wonderful, easy, secure parking.  4-5 TV's in the bar area.  Separate restrauant so you can dine without the bar overlap.  Good beer selection.  Servers and hosts were cordial and efficient last night.  Appetizer was competent but nothing special (but then again, aren't most of them?).  

Band in the bar area -- Bee'z is looking to expand their space into another adjacent room which would help immensely on giving both the audience and band some maneuver room.
  
Restroom was very tidy and clean.  Tables bused quickly.  Service was quick without being tackled at the door.  Self-seating when I came yesterday afternoon which is fine by me.

It takes only a few minutes past 79 376 to Bridgeville... would make a great local \"team\" viewing place.  

So many places to go to in the region and many are not well maintained.  Bee'z was so maintained.

{"text":"Staff wasn't friendly, service was extremely slow. Waited way too long for subpar food."}
{"text":"Very poor meal and very inattentive service.  Had the seafood salad, probably a mistake at a pizza place.  Huge mound of bitter iceberg lettuce, a few rings of shriveled green pepper, pile of vile canned black olives.  Some of the shrimp tasted spoiled as if they had been stored improperly.
The waitress seemed overly busy and didn't check up on us very often despite the restaurant being half empty.
Not recommended."}
{"text":"Beez is one of my local favorites to go to any day of the week. The service is absolutely fantastic and the food is delicious. Seating is almost always available in the evenings too. 

We start out with an order of 12 wings, all of their sauces are delicious, but my favorites are hot, hot bbq, and honey jalapeno. Their fries are thick, crispy, and tried to perfection, just wait a minute before eating them since they come out piping hot straight from the fryer. 

I've never been disappointed with their sandwiches and hoagies. I can't comment on the salads, pastas, other entrees since I love the sandwiches too much to try anything else. Their spicy chicken hoagie is massive, so order a full hoagie if you want lunch and dinner for the next day. The chicken sandwich does not disappoint as well since it comes loaded with huge chicken tenders, bacon, and cheese. What's not to love in that? 

Beez will continue to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Cannonsburg area. Even one of my family friends moved away from Pittsburgh over 7 years ago, and the one thing he says he misses the most is going to Beez"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. My boyfriend and I go here when the craving hits. The portions are very nice size and the staff has been great every time we have gone. Food was so good :) this is one place on our list for sure."}
