{"text":"Whaaaaaaat a disappointment. Maybe it's my fault. I dont know why I expected a good taco from a place that calls itself \"Silly Taco.\" Silly me.

The meat in the steak taco felt like it had been cooking for four days. DRYYYYY! It tasted like nothing. No, that's a lie. It tasted like salad. There was a pound of lettuce and tomatoes on top of my steak taco. Who the eff puts salad on a taco?

The beans on my bean and rice taco were DRYYYYY and tasted like windex or something. The rice was nothing more than Uncle Ben boil in a bag white rice.....no cilantro/lime no cumin/tomato. No salt even? Geez. 

I asked for soft corn tortillas, because what self-respecting taco-eater eats anything else? I picked up my taco and the shell split down the center and my pound 'o salad fell out into my dish. Duh. I guess I had to ask for WARM corn tortillas. Who makes tacos, calls themselves \"tacos\" and does not know how to properly assemble a taco? Taco Tontos. That's who.

Salsa verde and some other sauce I got were alright (must have been pretty great if I can't remember what it was!), and the waitress was very nice. 

Bottom line: this place SUUUUUUUUUCKS."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to express my love for this place. I go here once or twice a week, and one of my friends's parents own it. I certainly feel special as the awesome and helpful waiters and waitresses almost fight over who gets to serve us. If I could give service 300,000 stars, I certainly would. The food is extraordinary and is a million times better than that of taco bell, or and other taco place. Their chipotle mayo is the bomb, drinks are made with expertise. Everything is fresh, and when you taste the food, you'll want an El Biggo. The wait time is small for both food and seating, and filling that time is easy with the entertainment of the talented and awesome staff. Have fun, and enjoy Taco Tontos!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when I was at Kent state and I love it nearby in Lakewood more than ever!!! Drinks are awesome, staff are super nice and food is fresh and tasty ! I truly enjoy the vegan options and the deserts are soooo good! This place is such a gem. A healthier fresh take on Mexican cuisine. PLEASE GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Not awful, but don't have soft shell corn tacos. The Mexican grocery store down the street is the place to go for authentic food. Cheaper too."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. However, the ambience is horrible and the service is terrible. We have picked up there three times within the past two weeks, and every time we did not feel welcome. The waiters and the servers do not speak to you and the the girl behind the register seemed like she was annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted and was rushing us. They look at you cross-eyed and are rude.  I did not feel welcome there."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place ! I'm usually a Barrio girl but decided to switch it up! The food tasted pretty good until we found a green bug in my daughters taco ! Didn't think to much of it until I found one in mine as well! They took them off my bill which I would have insisted on but didn't seem to care much about it!! Never again!"}
{"text":"Probably more of a 3.5 star review. Nothing too special but it is good. The queso and citrus cilantro corn salsa were delicious. A lot of reviews say its loud and crowded but I have never experienced this. Both times I've gone have been Friday nights too. I mean it wasn't necessarily \"quiet\" but its a bar/taco joint that originated on a college campus, what do you expect? It definitely has a college campus type vibe so when you're in the mood for that kind of food it hits the spot. Despite that campus vibe, the food tastes/looks very fresh. Really liked  the two-layer taco and one was enough after indulging in chip and dip sampler."}
{"text":"Bland and overpriced. Good service however. Everything is extra, chips and salsa, sauce etc."}
{"text":"I definitely have to decrease my rating from 4 down to 2 stars. On our last visit the place wasn't very clean. They also left the door open and we were harassed by flies the entire time. Also the food has also gotten very bland and could use some refining (e.g. the steak chunks in a burrito are too big).

My girlfriend had a coupon for a \"baby burrito\" (because they screwed up an order on another date), but when they brought that out it was way burnt! She had to send it back, and by the time she got yet another, I had finished all of my food. We were sick of the flies and left after that.

Tontos just isn't keeping up when there are plenty of great Mexican options in Lakewood with better food and a better beer selection. Go to Barrio, Barroco, or Cozumel instead."}
{"text":"The services was quick and the food was out pretty fast. The reason the place got only three stars? Because I could've literally made a better version of both taco and burrito at home. The food was not bad, but Chipotle offers much more flavor at a lesser cost."}
{"text":"Today (2/18/14) was the very first time I stepped foot into a Taco Tanto's and I was Truly amazed! The environment is very original and unique, the decorations are fantastic! This was my first impression!

Now, I was going into Taco Tanto's as a salesman and was meeting with the owner Jill. Which turned out to be a win/ win situation because she sent me on my way with a chicken burrito that honestly can say was the best burrito I've ever had! 

My first couple bites were amazing, then I tapped into the hot salsa she gave me and it turned it into phenomenal! I am sold Taco Tantos! Chipotle who?! Seriously, you've made me a customer for life!!

{"text":"Best tacos and burritos. All fresh ingredients. Best of all, no pretense. People of all ages enjoy great food at amazing prices. Great table service, too."}
{"text":"Huge portions, good prices, friendly people!!! Awesome! The guacamole is fantastic!!! This place is a 'must try'!!!"}
{"text":"The beef tacos were extremely dry and very salty. It was a terrible lunch experience. My husband and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I got a chicken soft taco. It was okay I guess, the decorations are really neat and the place has a very cool vibe. I probably won't come here again but it's not a bad restaurant"}
{"text":"food was fantastic.  Highly recommend.  Service was first rate."}
{"text":"Mexican food is an art, and the tortillas and nacho chips are the canvases on which they create their masterpieces. Taco Tontos works a Strong sauce game. And why is life worth living if not for working a strong sauce game?

There is no limit to the selection of hot sauces to embellish your burrito goodness. The citrus cilantro is a nectar of the gods, and in fact the great Aztec deity Xochipilli may have slathered on this illustrious condiment in his dining experiences. 

For those that were dissatisfied with this sauce virtuoso of a place, I heard they are building another Taco Bell in Avon."}
{"text":"it's all about consistency & accuracy when you have a small & simple menu which basically consists of the same ingredients made in different ways.  we've haven't experienced either in eating there over time.  their staff is great - helpful, good service & always friendly.  the cheesy dip is delicious!  they always have a carefully curated & really good beer selection.  BUT they're so inconsistent.  i went there last night...ordered to-go.  we got two of the same thing - steak burritos.  they're supposed to have cheese & sour cream & lettuce according to the menu description.  we added cilantro to both & fresh jalapenos to one.  they barely had any cheese in either.  barely any sour cream in just one. neither had cilantro but one had spinach?  i usually check to -go orders but it's hard when your food is wrapped up in a tortilla shell.  which is why it's so important that your cooks are on-point guys!  i really want to like this place but this is my second time giving them a try.  We're gonna take a long break & go back for the classic third time's a charm deal.  I hope it works...i'm pulling for you guys.  please tighten up your kitchen & accuracy taco tantos!  p.s. your beer selection is quite good.  please spread the tasteful choices to the sodas selection - current options are soda's are too sugary and lack flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's great living right up the street from a restaurant like this. It's a really unusual spot and the atmosphere is definitely not normal. I've been here several times and they recently converted to having table service as well as take out. Before then, you ordered at the counter and then self-seated. Either way worked for me. The table service has kind of made it a little easier, though. Yesterday, I finally utilized their takeout service and it was speedy and the food was fresh.

The food is kind of an acquired taste. It is rather dry, kind of a charred, smoky Mexican cooking. Whether or not it's supposed to be authentic or a fusion style I wouldn't be able to tell you. However, I actually really like it. I usually get a combo burrito, which has beans and beef as well as lettuce, rice, cheese, and onions. Maybe more stuff. However, with all those ingredients comes a giant piece of food. Even when you order a burrito regular-sized (they have \"regulata\" and \"el biggo\") they're enormous. 

I really like the atmosphere. The service has been nothing but friendly to me and my friends/family. It is a very small place, but there always seems to be space for us. It's not the fastest restaurant, but it can be pretty quick and you can get out of there fast, if you must. I've never had to wait for a table and I've never heard of anyone wait for a table. I imagine I'm probably there on relatively slow nights because THIS IS A SMALL SPACE. However, it's uniquely decorated and the music playing is always top-notch. Notable selections include the original Strokes tracks and the like. Overall, my experience there always has been good. I've heard a lot of people complain about it, but it really works well for me. I have a soft spot for mexican food."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time. Liked their beer selection, but we didn't drink because the hubby's on antibiotics this week. Their cherry soda is surprisingly yummy without being teeth-chatteringly sweet - rather refreshing. 

Staff here are super nice. Small setup, pretty loud inside, really upbeat, so I wouldn't recommend for crabby-I-don't-like-people-needs-a-lot-of-personal-space types. 

We ordered the 2 layer tacos: mine with steak & sour cream was very tasty. Meat was well-seasoned, nicely cooked with a long, low & slow-cooked consistency. Although there was something in the seasoning reminiscent of Ortega or Old El Paso taco seasoning, I liked the way it tasted and it seemed like there was plenty of garlic, onion, and other spices, too. 

Hubby's chicken & bean taco was just ok. I think the chicken meat was rather mild, could have used more seasoning. 

We also ordered a combo burrito (ground beef & pinto bean). While it had taste, the pintos were way undercooked (crunchy). We didn't eat much of that. 

We really liked their sauces, salsas, and guac. The corn salsa is very mild, but nice texture. I especially liked their cilantro citrus sauce - bright and zingy. 

It's nice to have a neighborhoody taco joint that offers good beers, generous portion sizes, and friendly staff. I think they'll refine some of their recipes to remedy some of the hiccups. We'll definitely be back and we wish them the best of luck!"}
{"text":"What's not to love!.. just can be a little over crowded; wish they had to store fronts."}
{"text":"First time was a charm! Smaller neighborhood feel and great service. The best margaritas I have found in CLE in a long time. All Fresh, no crappy sour mix and all fresh fruit flavors. Kiwi Margaritas were creative, well executed and extremely dangerous. The food was excellent (and Hot!) and the limitless burrito/taco combinations will have us coming back for sure. Also were pouring some good craft beers. I cant wait to go back and sit at the bar (only like 8 seats) This place blows the competitors up the street away!"}
{"text":"Basically this place is a better version of chipotle that also happens to have a nice bar.  Taco tantos has a very hipster atmosphere and serves multiple craft beers.  The burritos are awesome and you can tell they use fresh, natural ingredients. Beware that the el biggo size is ridiculously big. I can never finish an el biggo so I go with the regulata.  My favorite burrito is the black bean with guacamole."}
{"text":"Other people seem to love Taco Tantos, but the best I can do is describe it as uneven. I had a chicken burrito bowl, which was a plate of ice burg lettuce with dry chicken, cheese and sour cream. Incredibly bland. The other people I was with liked their food I think, but everything seemed pretty forgettable. I had two margaritas- one was perfect but the other wasn't made correctly and had so much tequila, I couldn't drink it (and I'm no stranger to tequila). The atmosphere and service were great, so I'd go back if invited, but I wouldn't initiate another visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food but takes an irrational amount of time to make, with no real wait room. I would order TO GO. And then enjoy."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tanto. Great flavor, very good margaritas. The place is very small. I wish they were open a little later. I've never had a problem with service."}
{"text":"I love Taco Tontos because they use high quality ingredients... There are very few places you can get brown rice on a burrito.  They have house made vegan cashew sour cream, tempeh 'bacon', sweet potatoes, kale... Their daily specials such as 'tasty tempeh', 'kick-ass kale', and 'Summer or Winter vegetable' are really good too.  The people who work here are all really friendly.  It's a comfortable place to eat.  The drinks are great- especially the blackberry margarita.  I have heard people say that their food is too bland, but I think those people just don't want to think about what to put in their burritos/tacos.  I like that you can choose what you want from a large list of ingredients.  Aside from the specials, the combinations on the menu are somewhat bland and are meant to be added to.  The only problem with this formula and this restaurant in general is that when I first started going here their accuracy rate of giving me exactly what I asked for was about 30%.  Now, it is closer to 75%.  If you don't add a lot of stuff like I do, you won't have this problem.  I guess it doesn't bother me much... I still keep going and they have improved."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican anywhere in Cleveland. Their food is excellent. They use fresh ingredients and the large customizable menu should allow anyone to find exactly what they want. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So good, better than I remember from Kent!!! Service was a bit slow but they were busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Took the wife here 4 happy hour. For ou appetize we had a quasilldia. Very filling. I had the chicken bowl she had a Steak burrito. Good food and drinks were great. Will return."}
{"text":"So at 8 pm the daily special is sold out. My friend had his order come out wrong so they remade it and to top it off my quesadilla looked like it was dropped.  But I would have been willing to eat it except for it being 1/2 burned. I ate 1 piece that was not burned but tasted burnt and sent it back."}
{"text":"Having been loyal customers there since they opened, my wife and I biked there after a stressful day on 10-25-16. We noted that a new server who took our order did not seem to be paying attention. I told my wife, \"I bet it's going to be wrong.\" Sure enough, it was. Requested ingredients were missing. (There was also massive confusion as to who was waiting on us. We had never experienced a service problem there before. It's usually excellent.) After several requests to fix the problem, she brought back one of the cups of missing condiments, tossing it onto the table with an attitude. (Another server brought us the other missing items- after a long wait, with our food getting cold) We became irritated with this treatment. We discussed it openly, expressing our displeasure. Note: We're ALWAYS very polite with servers. I work with many in the food service industry and I know better. I know it's usually not their fault and respect their jobs. Sadly, this situation was spinning out of control.
 Finally, she grabbed my wife's half-finished drink and walked away with it, causing me to have to shout out to her. To make a long story short, other CUSTOMERS- total strangers-  mouthed off to us, being extremely abusive, objecting to the way WE were treating said server. I told them- both females at different tables- to mind their own business. They continued shouting at us over percieved \"unfair\" treatment of our server. (One of them who had been reading a book: \"Did you call me a dyke??!!\" Which I certainly did NOT. I said, \"Mind your own business and go back to reading your book.\") The kitchen manager, Todd, approached us and we tried to explain while two female customers continued to shout insults at us. The server in question then came over and interjected over her boss while he was talking, and took an attitude with us. \"Who are the customers here? Who's paying to eat here and for you to do your job? And why aren't those people being told to mind their own business??\" I asked. Todd then told us that he would pick up the check and asked us to LEAVE. This was utterly shocking, because we were NOT the problem. I asked Todd to step out side to talk. After explaining our history there and other things, he then admitted that he had already had several problems with that server, and understood our situation and why we were upset. He apologized for the abusive customers. He gave us two taco cards, which we appreciate, BUT he had already humiliated us by ejecting us. Bad managerial descision, in our opinion. This is all a damn shame, because the food and service is usually great. Such is the sad state of eating out today- one has to be not only wary of the service, but arrogant, self-righteous individuals who seem to feel totally justified in intervening in your personal dealings and getting in your face. We're not sure we'll ever return. We might talk to the owner, because, ironically, we literally no longer feel, \"safe\" there. Nor at the very least, respected."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the afternoon of the so-called \"Blizzard of 2012\" to try the BLT burrito.   Nothing authentic about it, but found it very tasty.  The hot salsa on the side had a nice kick.  I'd go again but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I love Tantos. But I'm never going back.

I never write yelp reviews and hardly have bad attitudes about places. I've been a waitress and bartender myself and can understand an off night. I'm done with Tantos though.

I have food allergies and Taco Tantos is one of the places around town that is able to be accommodating with their menu. My problem is, the last few times I've ordered take-out from there, the person on the other end taking my order has been short with me and has messed up my order (which for me means I simply can't eat the food). Also, I don't ask for anything crazy there. I pretty much always get the steak taco in a corn shell with no tomatoes. It really shouldn't be that hard. 

Today I thought I check everything before I left but got back to my apartment with my food and again, I had the wrong order (a flour tortilla with one of my tacos) and couldn't eat it. This stuff happens, it's fine. At this point I'm just annoyed with myself for not checking my order thoroughly before I left.

I called them back up to replace the order for the taco they messed up and the girl on the other end blamed me for not saying what I wanted correctly but said she would have them remake the one taco.

So I gave it about 15 minutes and went back. My order wasn't there and the waitress gal said it would be ready in a moment. As I was standing there, one of the cooks was very nice and apologetic to me and asked what I had gotten. I asked him if an order was placed for me, and he said no.

I then asked for my money back because I wasn't going to wait another fifteen minutes for the order they messed up and waitress gal made a whole fuss about it. She also said she didn't know how to refund my money.

I kind of got pissed off then. Considering she yelled at me for messing up my order. Then she lied and never put in a new order. Then she was acting like it was a huge to-do to refund my money. As I was leaving she said to me again \"I took your order, you never said you wanted a corn tortilla.\" 

As a past waitress, I would never treat a customer like that. It's so unacceptable. And as a consumer, I'm not going to get sick from the wrong order or berated for trying to fix it. (P.s. thanks nice cook guy for being on my side.)"}
{"text":"Wow! I love Taco Tonto's! Wasn't sure what to expect but the freshness of the guacamole and burritos was awesome! The bartender made me a perfect mojito and my friends got Christmas Ale on tap.  Fun crowd and good food.  Great place for kids too!"}
{"text":"Second time at the Lakewood Taco Tonto's today for lunch with my son.  We had \"el biggo\" burritos (each as big as your head) -- his fish, mine shrimp.  Each had rice, a bit of guac (I think) and this spicy slaw that was really good.  Mine was very generous with the shrimp, and my son said the same about the fish.  Perfectly concocted in that the flavor was unique & pleasing, but not overpowering to the subtlety of the seafood.  We also had fresh tortilla chips with homemade guac.  Too much food really, but it was great.  Five great beers on tap, including one of my favs, Negra Modelo, but sadly I gave up alcohol for Lent.  (Yes, I am an idiot.)

Some people don't seem to dig TTs, and perhaps that's because they may be expecting something else.  It's not gourmet food, but it is very good, well-prepared and a good value on wholesome fare.  They have tacos and quesadillas too.  To me, the lightly-browned (baked) burrito shell (soft with crispy edges) is definitely an improvement over the Chipotle approach.  And the place has a pleasant, bright, somewhat bohemian vibe to it (notice I didn't say hipster).  A fun place to eat your great burrito.

A Lakewood-owned business.  You should try it!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  My fiancee and I have visited several times and it is always packed in here.  It is a small little place, but that's their thing.  They're not a big chain or a Cozumel or an El Jalapeno's, just a small neighborhood place.  

Their margaritas are delicious!  The blackberry one is my favorite.  They do have a happy hour and drink specials and a large selection of bottle and some drafts on tap as well.  Their food is nothing fancy, but the price is right, has great flavor and there is plenty of it.  The staff is friendly and accommodating to special requests.  They have just started wait service in their dining room and they also plan to put in a summertime patio.

This is a great little spot to get some moderate Mexican food and alcohol."}
{"text":"Had a big steak burrito and some guacamole.  Guacamole was great, thou chips were clearly something poured out of the bottom of a Costco bag.  Not a big problem, as the chips were serviceable even though I was given a half a bowl of chip crumbs from the bottom of e bag.  The real disappointment here was the \"steak\".  Apparently this is yet another Mexican restaurant that thinks meat prep means throwing meat into a bowl of hot water and letting it sit there all day, getting dry, flavorless and defatted.  It was frankly gross, tasteless and clearly zero effort went into the meat prep.  It's a real shame because everything else in the burrito was fresh and delicious.  They are really ruining their own product with the bland, flavorless boiled meat they dump in it.  Atmosphere is nice, service is great."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't see what all the hype is about, the burrito was bland, chicken was okay had it delivered though uber eats, restaurant didn't wrap the burrito properly. Corn salsa had no sweetness or no bite to it, pineapple salsa was okay. The pico was really good, also got a beef taco with pinto beans, the beans were like a brick and beef was meh, too much for one taco, split it into 3 and you'll have a better product. Overall not gonna lie, I'd rather have chipotle it taste better and better salsas. 

Only plus side is that burrito was HUGE, and the quesadilla was good!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up a few days ago.. it was ok.. order was a little off. Felt more Tex mex than authentic"}
{"text":"I only went to Kent to party for 2 nights and never knew about Taco Tontos until my wife took me to the Lakewood location. It was totally awesome. The fish taco was insane and made me feel like i was getting a hug from God. The beer was awesome too. Music was cool. Staff was awesome. I think the owners are a hubby and wife team running the place and they really went out of their way for us. In fact, the lady who looks like a better version of Juliet Lewis was really helpful. The husband owner looks like a cross between Tom Selleck and Denzel Washington, was super cool and knows his beers. Anyways, we had an amazing time there and we were shocked at how inexpensive it was. We are going back ASAP."}
{"text":"Wow! First time tonight and was so awesomely surprised! Great food and even better service. Small, cozy, cute as can be... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in the world! Love the vibe of this place, the chill and friendly staff, and best of all the tacos! Great price and great value!"}
{"text":"Casual lunch day with the family.  Service was very good!  Loved the vegetable burrito options.  Daily specials are innovative.  Fresh..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be a downer but although the staff was Great! My burrito was nothing to write home about.  IJS..."}
{"text":"Eh, it's fine. I've been 3 or 4 times now, which I feel is enough times to make a fairly informed review. It's also enough times to know that I don't really need to go back. There was nothing exactly wrong with it, but there's certainly nothing right enough to make me jump for joy at the prospect of eating there. The food could generously be described as bland and generic and lacking in almost every element of flavor that I would have expected. There are plenty of other restaurants that do a MUCH better job with tacos/burritos/etc, and that's where I'll be taking my business."}
{"text":"If you don't do very well in tiny, cramped dining rooms with a ridiculous amount of people and asshole screaming children all around you, then this is NOT the place to be. Tuesday night at 8pm and there is a party of 10 for a birthday party?! Oh, and only one server on the floor. I'm really not sure why servers in general put more focus on larger groups as opposed to smaller groups who have been waiting a while to even see a menu. That happened. In the middle of looking at a menu and figuring out what to do the server all of a sudden decides that the table needs to be wiped off? Great.

As stated before, it's a pretty small dining room and gets pretty fucking loud. Especially when one table has 10 people having a dumb birthday party. I really get irrational and aggressive being in small spaces with loud noises and people bumping into you, so I had to move to the bar for some reprieve. No offense to the server. 

We got the chips and queso. It wasn't anything special. The more I ate it the more it reminded me of the Velveeta cheese queso with the peppers in it. Pretty sure that's what it really is. The bartender was more attentive than our former server, who in the whole time of unbearably sitting at a tiny table only managed to get our drink orders. 

We got the chicken burrito and the beef burrito. The lady didn't like the need burrito at all and only ate half of it. The chicken burrito on the other hand...I don't think I would even like it if I was black-out drunk. The tortilla was crispy and good, but the inside was just a bland cheesy mess. I really don't think cold lettuce of any kind should be fried and then baked enclosed in a burrito. That's cooking 101. Gross. 

Unimpressed with the quality of the food. Originated in Kent, its obviously geared for wasted drunk college kids who could eat dog shit off a tire with no problem. It was ridiculously busy that night as outlined, and other than the feeling of the server focusing on the bigger party who probably didn't tip well anyway I can't really hold her at fault for anything. She was really nice and obviously doing the best she could despite being the only one on the floor. The food is just bland and nothing special. Will definitely not be returning. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"So I came here looking for a meal to satisfy my hunger with my hubby after a nice date night...we had heard of Taco Tantos from friends as being an awesome place. While it had nice decor and friendly service, the food was really....really....bland.  Drinks were fine...my hubby ordered your standard margarita and got something completely different. We are not ones to complain either but the food was really lacking....portions on the other hand were surprisingly huge, and for that reason alone I would give it 2 stars. If they can dial in the seasoning (Chef....taste everything!!!) this place would kill it!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first and last time. I got a beef burrito el biggo which was big but EXTREMELY dry. While it did have rice, onion and lettuce it did not have any cheese, which it was supposed to have. The ONLY reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because of how large the burrito was. Oh, and the \"mild sauce\" tasted like funky...ie... spoiled tomato sauce."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places. I have gone by the one in Kent for years and never thought to stop in. Then my boyfriend took me to the one in Lakewood, and my life has been changed. It is way too much food, but that's always a good problem to have. I also highly recommend the queso ... you can't go wrong with it. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. 

PLUS, they just added on to the back of the Lakewood one. I used to always be worried the wait would be too long or it would be too crowded at get a good seat. But with the recent addition, I am never worried about the wait anymore. It's so great!"}
{"text":"Went back last night.  Last time I didn't notice all the extras you can add to your tacos to give them more flavor for just $0.30 each, so that definitely improved my opinion of the food.  My  husband had a chicken taco and a combo taco with beef and pinto beans.  He loved the chicken, but said he probably wouldn't order the beef again.  He was very impressed with the quantity."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of the food, as I've only had a drink (with a girlfriend, NO KIDS!) at Taco Tontos. But the drink (blackberry margarita) was delicious and HUGE. It would have been even better frozen, but they didn't do that. No matter.

It is very small inside, and had we not come at an off time (Saturday at around 6ish) it probably would have been really crowded and we wouldn't have been able to get a seat at the bar.

But something just feels a little unfinished about the place. I shall return to eat and then update my review."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice recently. Great Service both times - Once at lunch and once for a Friday night dinner with friends. We bought the $5 take home bottle of sauce. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was cold, no idea what their salsa is. It's loaded with garlic and looks like tomato puree. THATS NOT SALSA ANYWHERE... Burritos we're good but the \"Tacos\" are supposed to be 2-3 times the size of a regular taco. Yea they aren't, might be 50% bigger than Taco Bell and one taco is $6. Everything is a large cart which is also bogus for a taco joint."}
{"text":"The tacos here are absolutely amazing but really small so you have to wait if they're busy. The wait staff is pleasant & helpful, especially if you are with a group & need to make room. As I did say though it is small and usually pretty crowded so you're almost sitting on top of one another. They did mess up the order a little but it was quickly fixed. I do have apprehensions on going back. The steak tacos were incredible though & definitely made up for the blunders. The drinks didn't really have any flavor though & basically just tasted like straight up tequila which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Did a take out order from here last week and already thinking about when I will be back... If they keep you coming back for more, you know it was good (he-he). And cheap (bahahaha). Enough with the cheesy jokes, let's talk food! The hubby did a steak burrito and I the chicken. I chose the same add ons I do at my favorite chain burrito place. We ordered on their website and food was ready within a half hour on a busy weekend evening, not bad at all. I certainly found the chicken a bit bland, really seemed under seasoned to me. I used a ton (literally) of hot sauce. Next time I will add more sauce and more add ons to make it taste better. But there was no chewy meat like found in other said burritos. Huge plus for me personally, not the dog. All in all, close to home so they will definitely get my business over the other guys for the time being. They season that chicken a bit more with garlic, salt and pepper and I would certainly give five stars."}
{"text":"One of our mainstays. Got hooked on those burritos in late night Kent days (though they are the best in Lakewood - especially when the owner is manning the kitchen). My boys love the guac and the tacos when we bring them along. Great food, tasty cocktails, and good people."}
{"text":"What a bust!  Just because a local news station features them on the morning news does not mean the food is good, people!  This place is officially tied with El Guero for Worst Fast Mex in Cleveland in my opinion.  Dry, greenish brown \"steak\" and dry pinto beans just aren't my thing.  And whoever equated the steak to looking like Alpo was spot on.  They should use a shredded seasoned beef or even Barbacoa.  instead they use weird cubes of beef that look like dog food.  The upside is they offer a baby sized burrito which is 4\" and a perfect size for me.  And they have a nice selection of sauces.  Yes, the tortilla on the burrito is toasted and slightly crispy but who cares about that if you don't use quality ingredients?  This place is very similar to Ohio City burrito and I never thought they put out good food either.  The setup is cool and they have a good beer selection.  But dammit I will go up the street to Tango Taqueria for high quality Mex / Latin American food and homemade chips.  Or for authentic Mex you cannot beat Villa y Zapata.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Meh.  I found their beef tacos to be very bland, almost flavorless.  There are a lot of options for Mexican around Lakewood these days.  I miss the place that used to be here, Bela Dubby, which was a coffee/tea/beer dive that attracted hipsters, artists, and live performances."}
{"text":"In this review I am going to do a lot of comparison to another taco joint also on Madison, Barrio.  Both are excellent places to eat; they are just different- and depending on your mood, one will be a better fit than the other....  

Taco Tanto is a much smaller restaurant, so may need to wait longer to grab a seat, but is brighter and perhaps a bit cheerier in atmosphere than Barrio.  Their tacos are larger in proportion, but also a little bit pricier than Barrio. Taco Tanto has a small bar, but the selection is well thought out.  

Taco Tanto has a more extensive but set menu than Barrio, but allow people to customize whats on the menu so its almost as versitle.  I have had the beef tacos, chicken tacos, black bean tacos, and chips & guac.... and I ca't wait to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I often frequent this place as I live close by. I always have good service there. They have a bartender who wears a bow tie who is my favorite. He is personable and makes a great cocktail. I think I have to admit I like to drink here better than eat here. They have innovative cocktails and a decent craft beer menu.

The atmosphere can be crowded as this is a very small place but is still nice. It has a really awesome mural and ambient lighting.

The food leaves something to be desired. Many previous yelp posts claimed lack of flavor. Sadly, this is the truth. The meat lacks seasoning. Everything is kind of bland. However, they have a really nice selection of sauces. The cilantro lime and habanero are my favorite. Without it the food is sort of lack luster. I would not recommend getting anything with steak as it tends to be over cooked and tough.

I would suggest giving this place a try regardless. The chicken tostada was a winner. Thier Zombie drink is killer. Fruity yet packs a boozy punch. Just be sure to get a sauce on the side."}
{"text":"This place is not very good. I would rather go to Barrio, Cozumel, or even Taco Bell over this place! The food just doesn't taste right. But I have found that the workers are very pleasant people!"}
{"text":"I like that everything I've had here feels homemade. The tostadas are especially great! I also would like to add that they are very generous with their portions if you order on UberEats."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about Taco Tontos and finally made it there this weekend. I was with my brother and a friend. We all ordered margs, the waitress brought both of there's without mine and didn't even address where my marg was. I assumed that meant sure was going back to get it from the bar immediately but she just never did. I still didn't have my drink by the time we got our chips and queso (also not a fan that you have to pay for chips and salsa and the chips weren't very good). It took a while to get our servers attention to ask her where my drink was and she wasn't even apologetic. By the time I got it, my brother and friend were almost done with their first.
Silver lining: I got a chicken taco and it was good. Definitely way bigger than the average taco, it was more like a burrito. I might go back for the food again but terrible service."}
{"text":"We just went for the first time! Loved our food and our service! I had both a soft and hard taco! I really liked them both but LOVED the soft with chicken. Their citrus pesto sauce is amazing! And I like that you can do a trio of dips to try a lot of different things! If you haven't been go! Also, so many flavors of margaritas - strawberry was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, perfect drinks, and fantastic service! :-) - We will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Let's just say, after eating at Taco Tontos, we had to get tacos the next day because I felt cheated. The tacos tasted like cafeteria tacos that were over powered by cheese. The guac tasted like something we could have made at home, but the chips were good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a meal with the band before playing down at the Spitfire.  Fantastic!!  Got a delicious burrito and PBR for $7.  They have a nice beer selection, cool atmosphere, and friendly staff.  For a Fri night it seemed like a very mixed crowd and even through it was busy the staff had everything under control.  The rest of the guys loved their burrito as well and we will be back next time we're in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Love Taco Tontos! Specials are always interesting and tacos are huge. Their spicy margarita is amazing"}
{"text":"First visit to this great little restaurant yesterday, had a late lunch with my wife. Guacamole and salsa with chips for appetizer, tasty start! Burritos for entree, tempeh for the lady (along with a Negro Modelo) and a large cheeseburgerito for me, both very good and quickly prepared. It wasn't real busy at 4pm on a Tuesday, but there are plenty of tables and a bar area where a small group was gathered.
Great value for good food, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! I don't know what there is to complain about. I have been here twice and loved it both times, as did the people I was with. 

Okay, this place it tiny. So of course, there will be a bit of a wait. But honestly, it's very reasonable for the size of the kitchen. They work fast. 

Seating can be tricky so we are usually prepared to get it to go if it's packed. Just plan ahead and be able to work around that if you need or don't go if that would drive you crazy. I really think it's worth that possible annoyance, though. 

The regular sized burriots are HUGE. The guacamole is delicious. Any of the potato or sweet potato dishes are awesome. The hot sauces aren't that hot but the flavors are GREAT. Staff is really nice, decor is super awesome, prices are very reasonable! The beer selection isn't huge but it's good for the size of the bar! I really have no complaints about this place. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"In the very restaurant competitive area this little gem could be over looked but that would be a mistake. The stylish art and generous portions make this place a must try. We loved the delicious food and attentive/friendly staff. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Well for starters we've never chose to dine in and drink their heavily advertised $5 beers... Is that supposed to be a deal on the east side of Lakewood? What we have done was get carry out 3 times. 1st time was very meh. Pretty flavorless, pretty big, with a smorgasbord of underwhelming sauces. 2nd time was a drunken decision, so you almost have to cancel that experience. But the 3rd was a \"hey, remember that taco place? did we like it or not? I forget, let's try again. I arrive to pick it up only to arrive to a girl that looks like she hates anyone who isnt one of their 15 regulars. the bill came out to $24 and I had $30 and just told her to keep it. No thank you, no smile, no anything.... I didn't know $6 wasn't enough to be a bitch. So yet another good reason to not waste your time by sitting with these pleasant people. 
All I have to say is DON'T GET THE STEAK TACO! The meat was like dog food. No joke, it looked like rubber and tasted like Grandfather's foot. 
Just dont go here. Get it out of Lakewood. It's just another pot hole on Madison Ave."}
{"text":"Not very consistent in quality. Sometimes it's good, other times it's bland. Generally stick with the potato and sour cream tacos (i've been disappointed too many times with their meat tacos), but they were cold and bland this evening."}
{"text":"Love their burritos here! I've eaten in for lunch and also ordered takeout online. It leaves me full but not feeling sick as other burritos sometimes do. I also love both their hot and mild sauces."}
{"text":"Loving the casual vibe of the restaurant and the quality of the food. They did a great job of fusing the two together. Massive tacos and burritos at super affordable, even, dare I say, bargain prices. 
Had a chicken burrito on the first visit and it was awesome, maybe a bit heavy on the cheese, but what am I going to do, deduct a star for too much cheese!? Ha, yeah right! 
This visit was during beer week, you get the taco of the day, double-shell, with a beer in a collector glass for $12. It was pulled pork day and it did not disappoint. Paired perfectly with a #ElevatorBrewing Mogawbi, perfect indeed. Only question I have now is, when can I go back?"}
{"text":"Margaritas and daily specials are where it's at. Love the sweet potato and black bean burritos. Some items can be band at times, but I am generally satisfied. Service is also sometimes a little slow."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the place is too small.  The burritos are HUGE and delicious. The Guacamole is fantastic.  Service is usually good.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Damn! So freaking good and affordable! Literally an entire bag of nachos with the delicious guac. The burrito made me see god. Go eat here!"}
{"text":"I love my tacos & my wife loves burritos, so we were really excited to try thi place!
But to our agreed disiponintment we won't return.
Loved the ambiance and staff was gracious and helpfull,good beer selection.
We ordered a few different things tacos beef,steak. And fish.
burritos steak & beef.
All were made with fresh ingreediance, tacos were overloaded with lettuce 
Burritos were grilled and nice size but like the tacos lacked in flavor! 
The fish in the taco was over cooked & lacked flavor. The cheese & sour cream were the only thing you could really taste !
Most bars in Lakewood make a better $1 tacos but this is just our opinion."}
{"text":"Nice place and a very friendly atmosphere. Taco selections were amazing and very reasonably priced . Good place for a quick bite . There was no wait time.  Staff was very nice. Would definately recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"On par with chipotle. No thank you. Way too small for a restaurant and service is slow. Stay far away from this one."}
{"text":"Too much lettuce. Don't ask for sprouts, you'll end up getting a sprout burrito. They used maybe a tablespoon of rice in the entire burrito. Not impressed. But maybe that's just my high standards for Mexican food, being from California."}
{"text":"Fav spot for Mexican food in Lakewood.  Great drinks, amazing food, and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"More of a bar than tt kent, which I see as an upgrade, food was almost exactly the same.  Hot sauce was a little hotter and a bit more liquified, I prefer the kent puréed version.  Can't wait to eat more burritos."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite of mine. Despite their name, these tacos aren't dumb, they are genius! Their menu is very creative. They include things that you wouldn't normally find in authentic Mexican food. But that's okay. Everything is very cheap. You get a lot for what you order. Although it was a lot I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't stuffed. I was just full. That's what I like in food, good portions. I ordered the cheeseburgerito. It tasted like a cheeseburger with a little spice due to the chipotle mayo. I was very pleased. The staff  were very friendly. The service was excellent and quick. I'll definitely come here again if I'm craving some \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"I had a dining experience here that would not take me back a second time. Service was very slow ( appeared to be a three-person operation- bartender, server and cook). I ordered a taco bowl without potatoes and it was served with potatoes. The menu is good and the restaurant overall has a funky, eclectic vibe but the service and order mess-up is not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"We were craving taco's and on our way to Barrio when we made a last minute decision to try Taco Tontos - big mistake...  We had the guac which was fairly good and tried 3 different tacos and a burrito.  Not sure if it wasy the topping we choose... but nothing was particularly tasty.  There was a bad flavor in the chicken burrito not exactly sure how to describe but it was something on the meat.  Nothing here would make me want to come back... and it was very pricey as well."}
{"text":"Huge tacos and great cheese used in them, seemed like it was Chihuahua cheese which is my favorite. I placed my order via uber eats since I had worked 11 hours and didn't want to go eat alone. I ordered 2 tacos in the hard shells - vegetarian for both. One black bean with the usual lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Second was a cheese taco with the same toppings but I added on mild sauce, onions, Pico and corn salsa. The only thing I regret is getting the hard shells because once my ordered was confirmed it was on its way by uber eats, it noted another stop was being made before so they were soggy. Next time will be the flour tortilla or a burrito. I also ordered the trio dips with chips. I loved the queso, but it came in a smaller container and only half filled so that was depressing. The salsa was okay but nothing beats traditional salsa. The guacamole was horrendous - it was basically partially mashed avocados with a squeeze of lime and salt. It was more whole avocado that someone took a lime slice squeezed over and sprinkled some salt. No bueno. The salsa and guac were in larger containers than the queso and completely filled to the brim. I will give this place another chance and hopefully the burrito is a better experience."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Mexican place around. The burritos are amazing, huge portions, and very inexpensive. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. I got the Tandoori Chicken special in a burrito and it was excellent. It arrived nice and warm like a delicious food sleeping bag full of joy and chicken. I like that you can get the special in a Taco or a burrito or however you want. The guacamole was decent and the hot sauces on the table were good. The habanero margarita was good at first, but turned out to be way too salty near middle, even when ignoring the rim and using the straw. Would happily go back!"}
{"text":"I want to go with a 3.5, but the food was too yummy to go with the 3...so I will round up. I love tacos of all kinds and there was nothing bad about this place, but taco-style-wise I just have some other  preferences. The staff here is so friendly and pretty well attentive, awesome. The margaritas were super good. I had the habanero and loooooved the heat this cool, refreshing drink puts off. The tacos were so good. It's fun to pick your own toppings. I just prefer 3 smaller tacos to 1 giant taco because they are easier to eat.  My husband got the burrito and it was sealed up all nice from the grill, so I will probably get that next time. We also got the chip dip sampler. The queso was delicious, very creamy with a tiny bit of spice. The red salsa had a nice roasted flavor, but I like chunkier salsa. Everyone in my group liked the guacamole, but they do mix it with sour cream and I am more of a purist. The prices were very affordable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent.  The burritos can be dry and the meat isn't as flavorful/marinated as it should be.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Two of us went in on a Tuesday for lunch. The atmosphere was very nice. Our waitress brought us waters right away. A couple disclaimers that are not reflected on the establishment. Chips and salsa are an add on and their food is larger than expected which they do tell you. We ordered a normal size chicken burrito with pineapple salsa and a double taco. 

The reason for four stars is because of the way they do business. Now I understand you have to keep up with the times and a lot of places are doing this but it is a huge pet peeve of mine. You do NOT serve online orders before seated guests. 

The online orders have already been received and they can wait when they come to pick it up. The people who are sitting there waiting are the ones that took the time, want to be there, and will give you a tip. They are first and foremost. 

Overall, the service was very good and the food was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. 

They did well on the campus of KSU because, well, poor college students have no choice. And no taste. 

Their guacamole is perhaps the worst I've ever had. It should really be called something else. Guaca... pukey?

I feel a bit bad being so smug-uppity but there are several more options for tacos y burritos in Lakewood that blow this place away. 

Service is super friendly and stuff but still, not good unless you're accustomed to T Bell."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.75 for me!  The tacos were super delicious and our server was great. The only downside is that this is a small place but that does not interfere with the flavor of the food or the nice drink list. It is cozy to say the least. I would recommend that everyone try this food. I had the special for Cleveland Beer Week with a pineapple salsa that was to die for. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Best burrito in town every time I go.  In fact my picky eating kids ask for it consistently.  Chill atmosphere and easy to find.  I can only hope an eastside expansion is in the works.  Keep up the great food offerings MUAH!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke Mexican restaurant yeah right the worst place I have ever eaten sour food is not good anyone who knows about cooking would tell you that if foods sour is because it's not fresh or it out too long they need better cooks not happy"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with Taco Tonto's. Everything tastes like it came from the neighborhood warehouse club, right down to the broken and broiler-darkened stale chips."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends. Iced tea was great. Steak burrito was excellent. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on an early Saturday afternoon. This is my ideal place to eat these days. The service staff is minimal. you place an order at the bar and they call your name when your food it up. I don't rate restaurants typically on ambiance or service. My main review is about food. Food is why we go out to eat and it is the reason we come back. First we stated with chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and warmed slightly. The salsa was all fresh cut vegetables and exceptionally fresh cilantro. There were a lot of chips and an equal amount of salsa. This is important because most places pile on the chips and add a scarce amount of dip. 

I ordered a steak burrito with added guacamole. All of the ingredients were fresh and the burrito was grilled so there an added crunch. For some extra flavor there were  home made mild and hot sauces available on the tables. The mild sauce was fantastic and added just the right amount of spice and flavor to my burrito. There are two sizes you can order. I ordered the regular. The next size was larger. I saw someone eating a large and it was huge. The regular was plenty for me.

In the end, the food was fresh and delicious. I enjoyed everything from start to finish and I will be back again. Next time I will be getting the tacos."}
{"text":"Taco Tantos in Lakewood is a cute little taco spot with a full bar. Food was great. Great portions and cheap price."}
{"text":"--3.5 stars--
Went here for lunch with work colleagues. Big fan of the colorful interior of this place, and have to give it a few extra points for quick and friendly service. Overall, I thought the food was about average compared to other restaurants on Madison St. I had the fish burrito special, as well as the corn salsa. The corn salsa would have benefited from being more than just garnished and seasoned corn; I was definitely expecting a more traditional pureed salsa texture and more of a kick. On the plus side, this place is a good value, the burritos here are huge, and some of them come with guacamole."}
{"text":"I came to Taco Tonto not expecting much, but I was in for a BIG surprise. Tonto's is a creative, fun, inexpensive, vegetarian and vegan friendly \"contemporary Mexican\" restaurant with quick, friendly service and a spectacular menu.

I enjoyed the seasonal squash burrito. For $5.50 I was served a chubby tortilla full of steamy and delicious food which was completely satisfying as a meal. (You can super size for $1 extra if you so desire.) They stick the burrito in the oven before serving so the tortilla becomes stiff and crunchy, making for an easy, utensils-free meal. This food would work well for take out or eating on the go for that reason. I love their homemade hot sauce which is available at all tables in both mild and hot varieties.

My server Natalie was alert, friendly, and fast.

I hope to come back to sample their many interesting burrito and breakfast options as well as their housemade sodas. Taco Tonto's brings a wonderful dining option to the Madison / Birdtown area of Lakewood. I live in Florida but I'll be sure to come back whenever I'm visiting my in-laws here in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Taco Tontos is so great. Everything is super delicious, the staff is wonderful, and they do a very good job getting you squared with a drink at the bar during what is usually a pretty quick wait for a table. 

I very much recommend the queso and chips; both are individually on point and perfect together. The guacamole is not my favorite in the world (it's a little too smooth), but all the drinks are excellent. Definitely try a house margarita or the habanero margarita if you are into spicy drinks (I absolutely love it), and the hot toddy is incredible. 

Oh man I really love this place, and I didn't even go to Kent!"}
{"text":"I think I really really really want to give this place a 5 star rating but I might in the future when I go back here again.

To start, this is a really cool hipster bar/restaurant. The environment inside is really cool and similar to the Barroco Grill just down Madison. Great selection of beers and liquor, friendly friendly servers and bartenders and just overall a friendly place.

The food is rather really good, I got the beef tacos there in a gluten free shell and it was MASSIVE, for 1 dollar you can get a tiny hard taco at T-Bell but here for 4 dollars you get this MASSIVE taco that could fill you up if you aren't starving. The beef could use some more seasoning but I got this really good hot sauce with it and it was great. I also had chicken quesadillas, delicious but I wish they offered whole-wheat options instead of the white flour.

Overall for anybody else this would be a 5 star place but lack of whole wheat options and sometimes lack of seasonings on some of the food would only make me give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh.   Standard fare tacos,  burritos,  tostadas, and  salads.   But where it gets interesting is the add ons!  My standard beef taco was really good but adding smoked chipolte made huge difference.  Really bold flavor mixed with fresh ingredients equals yum!

The salsa and chips tasted pretty fresh too.   Both probably homemade.   Nice sized menu with lots of options.   But only about seven tables and a small bat.   If you are here with a crowd, you may wait awhile. Service was decent,  but closer to slow than deliberate.  Not a quick lunch stop, but with visit!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Combo burrito bowls and tantos soda is a fav! Support local business !!"}
{"text":"Big, Big tacos

Above average guac

Good beer specials

Open early

Will likely try again, maybe via uber eats"}
{"text":"We were excited to try the neighborhood taco bar.  After moving here from Texas last year, where tacos are just a staple/way of life in everyday food, I have been searching for a good go to taco joint to fulfill those cravings.

Taco Tontos is not that place for me.  

I have to admit that I liked the location, and the fact that they had good beer on tap.  But, the food was wicked bland.  Seasoning people....season the food."}
{"text":"Very fresh with lots of healthy options.  Do yourself a favor and throw some salsa and sauce add ons with your taco or burrito.  A single taco is HUGE and makes a meal."}
{"text":"I can't really understand why some are bitching about Taco Tantos. Poor Cory's life must be unbearable since his halved burrito incident, and what the hell does Blue expect black beans to taste like?

My partner and I have been in here a half dozen times and NEVER has the quality of the food been anything worse than delicious, and the wait staff is always pleasant and courteous. 

I like this place because the food, salsa, hot sauces, etc are freshly made, not scooped out of a bin of guacamole from Sam's. They also have great vegan and vegetarian options. 

I think some people just like to bitch. If you want an authentic taco go to freakin Mehico."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst customer service I've had in a long time. The waitress dropped two waters in front of us and walked away without even saying hello. Five minutes later she comes back up and says \"do you want something besides water\" and leaves the table again. Then she comes back again after another five minutes and says \"do you know what you want\" and repeats this until we had finally decided without her ever asking if we had questions about the menu or needed suggestions. She brought out our food which was a poor excuse for Mexican food. It tasted more like an American traditional restaurant trying to have a themed Mexican night. It was mediocre and some things were just too gross to finish. The waitress then brings our check back to us and without even looking at us throws it on our table because she was too preoccupied with going to greet her friends who were at the door. Everyone who worked at the restaurant seemed too distracted with talking and hanging out with each other that they were barely paying attention to the customers at all."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for lunch. We were disappointed with our food. I ordered the chicken tostada and it was underwhelming. It seemed like something I could make at home. No spice or pizzazz- just a tortilla, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and plain chicken.

Maybe I've been spoiled by Barrio's endless flavor combinations, but I don't think I'll return to Taco Tontos."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly bland. I was expecting gourmet and fresh ingredients, instead I found myself eating food that could have been served from a concession stand at a little league baseball game.

The ground beef was unseasoned, the tomatoes dry, the lettuce bagged, and chips old and stale. 

Unless you're drunk and need some sustenance, I'd refrain from eating here. This place no doubt makes Lakewood's worst restaurants list."}
{"text":"It's transit mall the other is about this restaurant correct. Zero personality rude staff. I tried to find one polite one but never happened."}
{"text":"A rare five stars. The atmosphere is obscure art on the walls, friendly and homey. Dee the server/bat tender is amazing and very informative. The food is very flavorful, is had a two layer burrito with beef flavored out of this world, with black beans and guacamole for the \"glue\" to make the soft shell stick. Also had chips and salsa(pineapple and original). Wife had a burrito, come with an appetite or prepare to take it home. Chips were wheat or some grain flavor. We also had Margaritas(mango and blackberry), all very amazing."}
{"text":"went in at 530pm and it was starting to fill up.  within an hour every seat/table was filled and people were eagerly waiting.  i ordered 2 soft shell tacos- i usually prefer soft corn shells and not flour- but these worked.  the order came out missing some stuff but it was easily remedied. i want to try the nachos next time."}
{"text":"Okay so I went on Cinco de Mayo, because America that's why. I was looking at the menu and noticed a quesadilla in the appetizer section. Let me tell you. That was no appetizer.. It wasn't folded in half, or small. It was two full tortillas on top of each other. Making sweet love in the form of a Mexican delicacy. And oh was it sweet. You can taste the passion. Truly the best quesadilla I have ever had. I originally planned on sharing it with family. Hahahahaha!! I laughed at my stupid self after I tried it... No way I'm sharing that... It's like how someone promises to share the money they win at the lottery but then disappear with it till it's all gone. Basically that's exactly what I did with that quesadilla. 

On the other hand, the taco was okay. I liked how the meat was seasoned but I wasn't a fan of how they folded it or the shell itself. It was just okay. 

Back to the quesadilla... It was bomb! 
Yes, I would eat it again. 
Yes, I would buy it even if they raised the price. (Please don't though)
No, I still wouldn't share it."}
{"text":"Really good chicken burrito. El biggo chx with hot sauce, no sour with vegan guacamole. I have ordered this several times and I'm always pleased. The steak burrito on the other hand isn't good at all. It's not steak, more of a beef roast. Hence a reduction in a star. I'll be back again to try some specials for sure."}
{"text":"The new dining room is really nice and it seems like they are way more consistent eating in that take-out. Their steak taco is quite a bit of food for $5.75. Too bad it's table service only or I'd eat-in more often but adding tax+tip increases the cost of eating there makes that $5.75 taco $7."}
{"text":"Smallish hole in the wall taco joint, hipster vibe.

The server was nice, just the right amount of attention.

The taco was huge, added on beans, onions, double wrapped with guacamole. They have a house made hot sauce I couldn't stop putting on my chips, real good. The corn salsa was ok. Lastly, the price was rockin. 

This could easily be a usual hangout for me, absolutely."}
{"text":"I started off with a strawberry margarita ? can you blame a girl? ...lol anyways. I ordered queso dip and guacamole  it was bomb asf! Definitely try that shit. 


I ordered a steak taco with my rice on the side with sweet potatoes on a crunchy taco. 

It was delicious . They have so many extra add ons for your taco to choose from!  

I love sweet potatoes"}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh! Great small business with excellent service. Dining room is a little small but it goes with the overall cozy feel. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ate the cheeseburger burrito $7.50 here a week ago and I have thought about it every day since. Maybe I was tired, maybe I was just really hungry, I don't know, but this burrito tasted super good. At first thought you think a cheeseburger burrito is bizarre, like who the eff wanna eat pickles in their burrito? Listen man, do it. There will be no regrets. 

I stopped in late one Friday night, a group of five, and luckily some patrons were leaving so we only had a couple minute wait while the table was cleaned and set up. The front part of this restaurant houses a small bar and some seating but there is a room in the back as well. I enjoyed the lively color on the walls. 

We split the dip sampler $9.50 which was vegan guac, corn/pin apple salsa, and queso. It was devoured quickly. I ordered the special drink some kind of apple pie mixed drink $8. It was not good. I ate the whip cream off the top and the glass was still full when we left. My friend ordered the mango habanero drink (I think) and it was pretty tasty, sweet with a kick. Disappointment was reversed when we ordered our burritos though, my burrito was accidentally labeled wrong and given to another. My friend was like \"I think I just ate a pickle, this tastes like mustard...\". She was a bit sad to discover that the wonderful tastes happening in her mouth did not come from her burrito, but mine that she had to give back. 

I can definitely see myself coming back for a chill easy-going night with a tasty boozy drink and a tasty burrito. (Our server was pleasant as well.)"}
{"text":"Just placed a pick-up order for the Lunch Special today, explicitly telling the person who took the order, that I had a $5 off coupon that would be applied to my order, he confirmed order. I went to pick up my order, and upon arriving I handed the same guy the $5 off coupon and he pointed to a sign on the kitchen counter saying that the coupon was a misprint and that the store wouldn't accept the coupon and that my order would in fact be the full retail price. I asked him what he could do to make it right and he proceeded to say \"nothing\", \"sorry man\". Wow, I don't see the coupon clarification anywhere on your FB page or website. I hope that this is just an oversight, and not how you would treat a customer through a clear bait and switch, it's not my fault they marketed a coupon and failed to honor it. I will NEVER patronize Taco Tonto's again!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to checking this place out.  It was good and bad.  We ordered using their online ordering.  After reading other Yelp reviews we ordered add-ons to our beef taco and Saturday pork soft taco.  First, we were charged an extra $3 for the additional toppings and they forgot to add the toppings to both tacos!  And, we ordered a side of queso for $2 and they forgot to include that in our order.  As other reviewers say the guacamole is \"ok\"  Needs onions and seasoning.  The one good thing is the beef taco was very good (just wish they would have included the extra toppings we ordered!)  The corn shell stayed crispy with carryout which was great and the meat portions are twice the amount for the price.  Tacos run around $4 but equate to two tacos at other restaurants.  The beef was really good.  The Saturday pork special tasted gross.  When we picked up our order we could see the pork sitting in a vat with the lid hanging off and it looked dry, like it had been cooked hours before.  The cheese that they use is excellent.  Their hot/mild salsas are terrible - no texture very runny and \"blah\".  The corn/cilantro salsa excellent.  Pineapple salsa has too much pineapple and very sweet.  If you want chips/salsa that's an extra charge and the chips...we couldn't figure out if they were home made or from a bag.  We love chips and salsa from Mexican restaurants and with most ,it's complimentary.  I wouldn't pay for the chips/salsa here.  Not sure if we will go back, but we will definitely call them Monday to try and get a refund for the items they did not include in our order, but we were charged for."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a group of friends over the weekend. I was very excited to try this place since I've heard great reviews from my friends. It was really nice that we were able to call ahead and reserve the large table in the back since we had 8 people in our group. I was surprised the restaurant was not more crowded when we got there since it was a Saturday night, but I didn't mind. I ordered a blackberry margarita, which I highly recommend. I really enjoyed the selection of margaritas and the drink menu that they had. Not just your typical house/ strawberry margarita selection. I then ordered the pico de gallo salsa for the table and some friends ordered the guac and queso, all were very good. I was disappointed they they did not just bring you chips and salsa and you had to order them adding $8 to the bill. I ordered the sweet potato soft taco which was so good. I was warned the tacos were huge so I knew to only get one, which I could not even finish. Overall a great experiencing and I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is just the kind of place we've been looking for in Lakewood.  Funky décor, great selection of beer, and reasonably priced food.  You can't go wrong with salsa, guac, and tacos.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the ingredients are fresh, and the portions are satisfying."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tacos here.  Service was A+. A bit less adventurous than Barrio, but there are lots of add on's if you're willing to pay the minimal upcharges.  Good, quality food, but what really stood out for me was the Two Layer Taco Sheet.  It's a hard shell wrapped in a soft shell and glued together with your choice of queso, magic melt, sour cream, guac, pinto, or sweet potato.  I went with the magic melt and it truly was magic, and heavenly.  I will definitely be back for that.  They have a lot of fun starters and other menu items I'd love to try.  Not that Lakewood is lacking for tacos, but I'm glad this place is an option and I hope it sticks around!"}
{"text":"After a Cleveland State visit with my son we tried to get into Angelo's pizza with no luck.  Once again, we go to the handy-dandy Yelp app and find Taco Tontos just around the corner.  Not being able to get into the restaurant we actually want to get into and choosing another based on the Yelp app seems to be the story of our dining experiences - doesn't always work out great, but thank God for Yelp.  

Anyways... the inside is cute, service was average, and food was average.  All three in my party had a burrito of some type with two of us thinking it was pretty ok and one thought it stunk.  I didn't realize the burritos are baked.  If you've ever taken Chipotle leftovers home and heated them up in the oven the next day, this is what Taco Tontos burritos taste like (not that exciting).  It was very busy, but it took REALLY long time to get our food. 

I would rather not go back for a second try - I just wasn't blown away by the food.  I'm glad some on Yelp love this place, I just can't see me ever being one of those people."}
{"text":"This place. 

I love it. Whenever I have a day to myself, I like to come and get some tacos and a cocktail or two. The staff is super friendly, and I always end up in random conversations with them. 
The hot sauce is to die for, spicy, but super flavorful. I generally go for beef tacos- hearty and simple, but exactly what I'm craving. The burritos are also excellent- very good pre-night out food to give you a good base for cocktailing. 
The house margaritas are lovely and amazing- though today I was swayed by their new Blueberry Vanilla Lemonade. This is the perfect \"It's my day off and I'll do what I want to\" meal! 
Always good music playing, the decor is super fun (I want my living room painted like this) and it's just a good, fun, funky yet comfortable environment. I'll be back many, many times."}
{"text":"Decided to try taco tontos for the first time today. I thought it was wonderful. Today's special was spicy chicken tandoori and unfortunately they were out of it. I will definitely come back again to try that one. 

I ended up ordering the chicken burrito, added black beans and bacon and it was massive and delicious. More than I could eat. The service was friendly, I can't believe so many reviews said negative things about the service. 

The beer list is huge. My final deciding factor was the Bloody Mary that I ordered. It was potent and it had a nice kick. I would definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Flat out.....This place is AAHHHHHHMAZING!!!!!!! The prices are good, the food is outstanding and the service is MUY EXCELLENTE!!!! Try this places ASAP for great tacos, burritos, and other great dishes!!!!  New FAVORITE SPOT for this Yelper!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Tontos. The food is always very, very fresh. I have been going there for two years and have not had a problem. I eat there several times a week. To the people that are saying that the food is bland obviously you didn't try any of there salsas which are all excellent. .The food is meant to be a medium for there salsas. For example the spicy cilantro is really excellent with the shrimp special on Friday. 

They also have the best margaritas I have had anywhere and I go to Mexico a lot. Within three months of the opening I had to join a twelve step program. For a small place they also have a remarkable selection of craft beers. Unless they are extremely busy the waitresses and bartenders are very, very friendly. But there are times where you just have to press for efficiency so they won't be chatting you up. This is small mom and pop operation and when it gets crowded it might take 15 minutes or so to get your food. But usually it is just 5 or ten minutes. 

Please note that everyone I have talked to about it loves Taco Tontos.."}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's in Lakewood?!  I can't even...I mean...please excuse any typos in this post; it's hard to see the screen with tears of joy in my eyes.  Some background: I used to eat here several times a week when I went to Kent.  I'd call my order in after class or when I got off work and then laugh at all the people standing in line at Chipotle while I went to pick up the best damn burrito on the planet.  When I was finally looking to move out of Akron a few years ago, it was actually a legitimate concern that I wouldn't be able to get my TT fill as often.  Well, problem solved.  

For those that aren't familiar with the Taco Tonto's formula, they bake the burritos after they roll them.  This gives them a crispier shell and (at least in my opinion) seems to bake in the flavors.  They also do tacos, bowls, and other options if you aren't in the mood for a burrito.  The prices are totally reasonable, with my steak burrito running around $7 for the big one (and that's after I add some stuff to it).  

I like that this new location has more of a bar and a pretty good beer selection to go with it.  They've only been open for two weeks up here, so I'd encourage you to give them the benefit of the doubt while the new location finds some traction.  The burrito I had last night was just as good as the ones I used to get, but it sounds like some other people had a different experience.  Regardless, I'm super excited that I get to introduce my Cleveland friends to what they've been missing out on up here!  

Get in on it now before the word gets out and the wait times get crazy."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed, the ingredients were very fresh but the flavors fell flat.  Rice and beans were very bland, they were missing the cilantro chili and lime flavors native to Mexican cuisine. The chicken also fell flat no charr or seasoning to speak of. There habanero hot salsa was missing the natural sweetness from the chili's. Everything seemed a little average. I would prefer to stay home and make my own tacos."}
{"text":"Wow! This was unexpected. To be honest, I was on my way to Barrio, and recently moving back to Cleveland, forgot they don't open until 4pm. But the taco craving was real. 

Stopped in, super divy, fast service. What I couldn't believe was how fresh everything was, from the salsa, to the taco toppings, everything was so extremely fresh!! (Even for my really picky friend lol) 

Big portions for how cheap the food was. Good drinks too!"}
{"text":"Love everything thing about the restaurant itself. Decor and staff make it a cool place. Unfortunately the marg was subpar and my two layer taco with guac had no flavor. Decent sized let down after the first impression."}
{"text":"I have to update my review after going back to taco tontos after a long hiatus. I first went back and got a blackberry margarita at the bar-delicious and strong :) I also go the pork burrito to go and it was delicious, would certainly order it again. Glad my faith has been restored in this nearby establishment."}
{"text":"The interior is cool. Bar is cool. Owner is a nice guy. Food is just OK. Tostadas should not be a soft flour toritilla on a pizza pan. It should be a crispy corn tortilla. One would expect they would know that.  He could do so much better if he hired someone that knew how to really cook."}
{"text":"Taco Tantos has some really great food at an even better price. I never question the quality of the ingredients like I might at some other typical Mexican restaurants. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I highly suggest the sweet potato tacos/burrito. Also, they've got a lot of vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"I truly do want to give this place more but I can't seem to and it's only getting a second star due to the great drinks menu which is very reasonably priced and that their mild and hot sauces where delicious. The mild went perfect with the tacos and burritos. Perfect zest, kick and flavor in the sauce, unfortunately that's about it on the flavor front as the tacos where less than plain with nothing seasoned or really anything interesting. Just heated up lettuce, tomato, rice an fish which was the special on Friday. Sad to say it but even a person that's not versed in the kitchen can season up a better set of shrimp and be a tad more inventive with a burrito. I get it, it's an easy, simple and not trying to be fancy type of place but even the simple can be flavorful, this wasn't. I will give it another shot and if it seasons up I'll readjust but as of right now I don't see that happening."}
{"text":"Meh. Food is so so. Drinks are great depending on whose making em. And nice rotating beer list. The Juan Collins is the tops. (Thanks Penny!) Also kale should be outlawed and delisted from the edible food roster. It has no place on a taco or burrito."}
{"text":"These are not tacos.  They are flavorless burritos that weren't bothered to be wrapped.  Three blocks away on Lakewood Blvd is a Mexican supermarket serving real tacos.  Those tacos blow these away and at 1/4 the price."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious. I've been going to Taco T's since college (Kent location) and it never disappoints.
Their baked burritos are delish (the beef with rice is my go to) and the vegetarian options with sweet potato are a great, light alternative. They can also do a 2 later taco like a cheesy Gordita crunch- you can choose magic melt (cheese) or guacamole between the tacos. 

The restaurant is on the smaller side, but they have expanded and have a full bar so getting a seat is never much of an issue.
Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I was living in Lakewood this was my once a week at least hangout spot. I loved eating burritos and drinking the craft brews on draft while talking to their very cool staff. Don't expect a traditional Mexican burrito because it's not a traditional place!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place are the burritos. Too bad the services there is not good. Very rude girls I don't know how they make tips. No smiles acted like they were too cool to be nice. Saw our server maybe twice drink and food order. Never asked how our food was or your order will be out soon. Have been there a few times and the girls always act like that. Will only be going back for takeout there for now on. The cocktails are not that great can make better ones myself at home."}
{"text":"Place is OK.  The food is stuff I can make at home with stuff from La Plaza.  Good, but nothin' that stands out too much.  Drinks were good but expensive.  The servers are the biggest turn off.  They are indifferent...like they could care less if they make money or not.  One was doing her makeup behind the bar and the other dropped our money off without even and \"thank you\" or \"you suck\"...anything.  Then she sat down next to us (5 minutes after her shift started) and chowed a burrito.  In a place so small, with so few people in it, one would have to actually TRY to make customers ignored.  Can't say there are other options for Mexican in Flakewood.....there are, but the servers are just as bad.  Maybe if I put on one of them Nacho Libre masks and do a flying elbow drop off a table it will liven up the place a little...."}
{"text":"So much food at a reasonable price! We stopped in for lunch and this place was great. It was pretty small and not a ton of tables, so we were glad to have gotten a seat. I loved that the burrito was pressed like a quesadilla. I also loved how quick the service was. I have no complaints and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, but the food  really sucks. On the surface, this is exactly what I want to see -- more  fast casual restaurants in Lakewood, especially along Madison Ave.

Taco Tonto's has \"the look\". The atmosphere and drink selection are fitting  a cool new restaurant in a lively metro area or college campus. The food is another story.

The person who said the food could have come from a concession stand at a little league baseball game wasn't kidding. There's nothing fresh here, nothing is being made in house, etc. A quick glance at the kitchen isn't needed to confirm this, but when you do look, between the absence of any significant cooking being done and the boxes from Old El Paso it's painfully clear. The quality is Aldi's at best. The jarred salsa sucks, even for jarred salsa.


Anyone acting smug comparing this place to Chipotle (i.e. the guy who laughed at the people in the line at Chipotle) should be embarrassed for themselves."}
{"text":"For 2 margs, 2 tacos, and a burrito this place cost me $40. I'm not sure if it's really worth that, unfortunately. 

Pros: the ingredients seem super fresh and there's a lot of options. They have tacos burritos nachos tostadas and I'm sure more I'm forgetting, but also everything comes with an impressive topping list. 

Cons: the food was pretty bland. It's definitely worth the 75 cents to get an array of sauces. I loved the smoked chipotle I got but my friend said the mild sauce on the table was pretty bad. The toppings are mostly 50 cents each which doesn't sound bad unless you're getting three toppings on each thing (I think that's a reasonable number) then you're adding an extra $5 onto your bill. 

The margs are nice and boozy but they're also $7-$8. I've been here twice and once my server was flat out rude and extremely slow. My second server was quite sweet and timely so I can't really speak on service one way or another since I had polar opposites. 

If I came during happy hour and wasn't hungry enough to eat more than one taco I'd probably be more inclined to love this place. Again, I like the portions and freshness but it can be bland so stock up on sauces and toppings!!"}
{"text":"A local institution since what feels like the beginning of recorded time, Taco Tonto's is a winning burrito bar with an impressive tequila selection stymied by some under-seasoned foodstuffs and marked difficulty in ordering to-go. Pick-up orders are available at the kitchen window. There is, however, no sign to indicate this, so those not in the know are left milling helplessly around the very cramped bar area, trying to flag down an addled bartender (they don't have the kindest manner, in general) or simply watching other patrons eat. The restaurant in general is strikingly small, so plan on a wait, or arrive at non-peak hours. With regard to food, TT offers an impressive range of burrito add-ons, everything from vegan guac and dill pickle chips to pickled jalapenos, black olives, and sweet potatoes. The ingredients taste fresh and wholesome, but they lack a certain salt and spice, chopping a star from the overall rating instantly. Not to say the burritos are bland per say, they just taste rather 'healthy' in an undesirable way. Would-be diners are encouraged to load up on the salsa. The queso, on the other hand, is outrageously good, perhaps the best in the city--gooey and rich and the perfect texture for endless dipping and scooping. Overall, TT is a swell local antidote to Chipotle, but they would do well to season up their veggies, and make their pick-up process a little easier to navigate."}
{"text":"Best guacamole in town!  Good drinks and great art. Small, so plan ahead if you go during dinner rush hours, but it's an intimate little place and very cozy"}
{"text":"For what it is, this is an amazing burrito joint! I love chipotle but this above and beyond better! They have daily specials with many vegan/vegetarian options! This is a great place for lunch or cheap dinner! Also a decent selection of drinks! Bean and rice burrito with guacamole is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"I try to support local restaurants over local chains when I can.  I had been to Taco Tontos only a few times before and the food had always been good, but I hadn't had anything that really stood out in my mind.  That was until a friend recommended I try the sweet potato chicken burrito.  Coming from someone who doesn't even enjoy sweet potatos that much, this burrito is AMAZING and will keep me coming back.  Something about the mix of the smokey chicken with the sweet potatoes is the perfect flavor combination.  I would highly recommend it!!

This place is also has a lot of vegetarian/vegan friendly options and a great beer selection. :)"}
{"text":"A favorite place!  The best burritos you will ever have!  Very fresh and made just how you want them.  We have been customers for several years and we love it!  We get our food to go most times.  As very small place.  Waitresses are super nice!"}
{"text":"Taco Tantos serves up feel good dishes, with ingredients that pop! We love the ambiance, the burritos are killer and the margaritas on point. The owners know their tequila and how to treat the customer. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Lots of good beer but food was SUPER bland I smothered my burrito in their decent mild sauce. Like smothered."}
{"text":"I'm not understanding some of these reviews because the food here is terrible. Totally bland, no flavor with absolutely nothing to brag about. Even the sauces can't help this food which is pretty sad. The service also matches the food. Oh well, I'll find a real Mexican place."}
{"text":"MMMMMM

Yummy guac. HUGE TOSTADAS. Very good margaritas. 

It's a little place with authentic food and the servers are tatted up, friendly, and readily available. 

I like the atmosphere, the prices, and the food. 

Definitely a go to spot for some cheap, but delicious tacos."}
{"text":"No flavor to the burrito.  Bland, not good.  The two girls behind the bar had personality like a rock.  Very un-friendly.  Bad service.  Cook was nice.  They just get a 1 from me.  Rizzo, you suck!"}
{"text":"The Lakewood Taco Tontos has really good food and drinks - lots of variety and good value. And quick and friendly service. Love it here!"}
{"text":"With so many options for great tacos in Lakewood, it takes a lot for one to stand out. My boyfriend and I came here after seeing an anniversary special of a crunchy (beef or bean) taco and a pint of beer for $5.

This was a great deal and the tacos were delicious. I noticed that the ingredients seemed especially fresh, which I loved. However, if we would have stopped in on a normal day, this would have cost us nearly $35 instead of 10. In my opinion, no tacos are worth that. When I can go to barrio and get free chips and salsa and be full on a $4 taco, it makes my decision easy. 

The food is definitely delicious and the place is worth a try, I just can't justify paying the $8 for any of the daily specials or a burrito when there are so many cheaper options."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a quick beer and burrito. Their specials are amazing...The 'kick-ass kale' is the best burrito I've ever had! Great vibe, awesome bartenders and great beer. This is my weekly stop!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The burritos and two layer tacos have always been delicious, including the specials. The food is really filling and well priced for what it is . The drinks also seem to be well made, just from watching the bar tender make drinks for a while. On that note.... 

Their customer service needs to be improved. A lot of people order take out from here and I think they do a pretty bad job of handling it. That is why I stopped coming here. One time I sat waiting for my take out at the bar very politely only to find out they had apparently called my name and I didn't hear them. (In the loud bar nonetheless). I'm pretty sure I had already paid too. Why wouldn't you just bring over my food to me? How do you not remember that I am sitting right in front of you waiting for my food???

After waiting for maybe 20 minutes I asked if my food was ready yet.(Yes i was very patient that day!!) What happened next was unbelievable.  They said my food had been ready for a long time. They gave me attitude because I said I didn't hear them call my name.  They literally scolded me for not paying attention. Whaaaat? It's my fault?  Honestly that is ridiculous.  I couldn't believe it. Rude! 

Seems like other yelpers have noticed the rude service too. Such a shame. Management should pay attention to this...."}
{"text":"I've tried the sweet potato taco at both this and the Kent location now. I wanted to love it, because the sweet potato taco could be amazing, but the ingredients just tasted so randomly thrown together. These guys gave me mashed sweet potato, but at the Kent location, it was cubed. I preferred the cubes, because they didn't just squish out the sides as much."}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, the customer service is sub par. I don't know how a bartender can make someone feel so unwelcomed(just for a pick up order). I work in the service industry, and from my past few experiences, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's super simple. Great ambiance. Amazing fresh food, huge portions, great prices. I love this place. I prefer to return for fish taco Fridays. My wife said that it is her favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Cleveland. Enough said. just eat here already!!"}
{"text":"I've had better Mexican. First of all the meat was over cooked. I got the steak burrito and it was bland and boring. Chips and salsa were bland and had no spice at all. On the bright side the service was good"}
{"text":"Love Taco Tanto's in Kent. Lakewood, you're doing just ok but I shouldn't have to wait 20 mins for a burrito. I'll still come visit you because:
1) You just opened a few weeks ago and I'm sure you're still working out some kinks
2) Your food is delicious
The sweet potato burrito with the hot salsa is awesome. I also tried the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies once... if they're offered, GET THEM. So good!

Please bring in the daily specials like the Kent location offers!"}
{"text":"The tacos were dank! The pineapple salsa is bomb diggity! If you want some good food check this place out! The service was on point! I will be going back great experience!"}
{"text":"Had the crunchy chicken and beef tacos, also the guac. Very mediocre , tacos are good size , Guac was average nothing great"}
{"text":"Taco Tontos is, in my humble opinion, the best burrito stop in the Cleveland Metro area. 
Every menu offering is fresh, made to order, and delicious! (Today's delight is the Fajitarito: a burrito featuring black or pinto beans, rice, cheese,  sour cream, steak, AND chicken, AND shrimp!) 
Burritos come in two sizes-regulata and el biggo!  The regulata is more than ample; while el biggo is not for the faint of heart, or appetite. 
The servers are friendly, attentive, and efficient, without being annoying.  I like them  as much as I do the food!
I live 30 minutes away, by freeway. En route to Taco Tontos, I pass at least three other sit down restaurants, serving similar fare that I've patronized in the past. I don't miss them."}
{"text":"In short: the service was so atrocious I left. We received waters right away, but then we waited over 10 minutes (I checked my watch) for our server. So I just went to the bar and ordered our drinks and received service immediately. I was more than half way done with my drinks before I asked the hostess who our server was. A woman with her nose pierced was pleasant and said she would take our order even though the man serving was supposed to take our order. I told the hostess how no one had come to our table in over 15 minutes she shrugged her shoulders and said \"Whoops well I'm sorry,\" and walked away. Didn't offer to get the manager or anything. Her attitude what was really disgusted me, and we left right then and there and went down the street to Yuzu. I'm giving this place two stars because the blonde bartender knew how to treat a patron and her blackberry margarita was amazing. They also were out of their apple pie drink, but I get that happens, so that didn't have an affect on my rating.

Also a 4 top ahead of this got their waters after I got our drinks from the bar. They're the real MVPs for staying."}
{"text":"Authentic? No. Delicious? Yes. Lemonade (get it spiked with vodka!), one huge taco ($4.50) and shared order of chips & vegan guac (really just regular guac...the standard version has sour cream) did it for me. Friday fish tacos are really good, great for the price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Kent location many times. I was pleased to find this one in Lakewood. The overall vibe is the same: hip, funky painting and decorations and very cool music playing (they were jamming some nice reggae today). 

This location is much bigger than the Kent store, and didn't seem to be as busy. The food was as awesome as the other location, but I have to admit that I think it tastes better in Kent .

I always thought Taco Tontos to be better than Chipotle in every way, and that still holds true. Plus i would much rather patronize a local establishment over a chain.

One big difference is the Lakewood store has a full bar. Not just beer.

The food was good, we got a table immediately even during lunch, the prices are worth it and reasonable, the wait staff were good, and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Well for starters, we ordered chips.  They were from a bag!  Then came the beef tacos. The meat was horrible! The server looked  pretty annoyed. The meat was so bad I just filled up on a bunch of chips! I would never go back there again!"}
{"text":"I have been a \"regular\" here since this location opened, I've visited at least once a week. 

The food is consistent, made with good quality ingredients, and the specials keep it interesting. Lots of vegan options and the menu is easily customizable for picky eaters. 

However the service sucks. It's been on a decline and any diner can tell the staff is inexperienced. I've seen bartenders pet dogs outside and smoke, come back - not wash their hands and immediately start serving drinks and food. They don't refill your drinks or offer to grab more beers/cocktails. It's like they don't want to make money, I've heard people order slightly more complicated drinks like a Manhattan and the waitress will just say \"we can't make those\" even though they have all the ingredients.  

In short, great food but GET IT TO GO! My friends tell me just to go to Barrio but the food here is better."}
{"text":"Taco Tontos offers a good atmosphere, good food, with reasonable prices. However the service and wait time make the previously mentioned almost not worth it. The bartender was extremely rude and a simple burrito and taco took over 1 hour to receive during a normal business time. There are a lot better places to go in Lakewood for tacos and burritos. Will not return."}
{"text":"I live in Bay and drive specifically every week to Lakewood get my fix. By far the best menu item is the burrito. Grilling it changes the whole flavor profile. My typical order: queso and chips, black and stormy, combo burrito- add pico. Go that route anyone will have a blast."}
{"text":"Sandi rocks the.bar! Best Margaritas!! The Tacos are amazing!! Great ambiance fun place delicious food!!! Love love love!! The staff is undeniably the best!!  Most importantly the food!! So so delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is typically busy. There are exactly four tables, so it is difficult to find seats at times. The food was great! I would recommend the tacos especially. There is a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Whoa, these are huge tacos!!

We went on a Friday night- craving something fast and Chipotle like- but more of a restaurant, taco tontos is a great place for that.

Our waitress must have thought we were crazy, but we ordered the chips and dip sampler (getting the pineapple salsa, guacamole, and pico de gallo) on top of our taco order. I mean, we thought they were just little tacos (we ignored the signs that said \"home of the original baked taco\" as well as the sign that said \"1 taco tonto= 2-3 normal sized tacos\". Oops.

We liked the fact that our chips came out warm for our sampler- I thought the dips were just okay. Had I not just gotten Tex Mex, I probably would have liked it better...but yeah, I thought the dips were just okay.

And then the tacos! They were HUGE!!
He got the sweet potato taco- it was like... all sweet potato with toppings, which he liked, but it was massive. I got the special taco (with the baked shell wrapped in a soft shell) of fish- it was okay, not the most flavorful, but it was filling and HUGE.

The waitress then commented to us about how we ordered a lot of food and how she was impressed in what we ate. Thanks. haha.

If you're looking for some tacos and want a huge size, and don't care about it being the best quality (aka just being hungry), it's a good place to stop. You definitely get your moneys worth with these tacos!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in you will immediately like this place. It's comfortable, colorful, smells god and is off the beaten path of other restaurants in the area. Feels like a friendly place where the locals come to gather.
However, the food is not that great to write home about. It is satisfactory and that is
about it. Prices are very affordable for what you get and the food is fresh. What's missing is a \"wow\" factor in taste.  A signature taste. I will say that the sweet potato taco is mighty good , if just a little bit too sweet. (are they adding sugar?) The green/verde sauce is good. But the chips taste like store bought. 
This place need just a little something extra to kick it over the top. 
Service was ok.
Also, beers on tap are expensive. Go for the el cheapoes. They could
use a beer special."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Taco Tontos during my years in Kent. This place is in such close proximity to La Plaza that I cannot justify ever getting a taco from them. I grew a fondness for potato burritos during travels out west and Taco Tontos makes a decent one. It is a nice stop along the Madison Crawl if you are hungry. The inside is cute."}
{"text":"I sampled a taco and a burrito, the food was OK, the embellishment has character, diverse, trendy location, good place to enjoy a beer, a bit too loud and crowded so you will need to wait for a table. Definitely better than any of the other Mexican restaurants in Ohio (sampled mostly in the Cleveland and Akron areas).

Taco Bell has a more extensive menu and may be better unless you want to enjoy a beer and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Taco Tantos was one of my favorite places to eat when I went to school in Kent and the new location didn't disappoint! Great friendly staff and fast service. 

I love the Sweet Potato/Black Bean burrito and the homemade Hot Sauce is the best around. (Sauce isn't too hot and has quite a bit of flavor)"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for more. It's a nice small environment with very little seating. The tacos were good but not\"ohhh my god!\"  It was good I MIGHT come back."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious! Portions are huge, ingredients fresh, and drinks good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Viva la Sweet Potato Tostada! Gotta say I don't enjoy many of the things on the menu without a ton of the add-ons and sauces, but I add nothing to the sweet potato tostada. 

If you can stand the heartburn, the habanero margarita is outstanding. The rest of the margs are mediocre. 

Their verde salsa and chipotle sauce make everything taste great. 

And the beer/tap selection is one of the best in Lakewood as far as I'm concerned. Certainly not the largest, but the best picks. 

For me, this is the type of place you go for a few specific, stand-out dishes when you have a taste for them. Otherwise, the offerings are unimpressive. 

Finally, I have to admit, 90% of the time that we visit is because we've gone to el Carnicero, Barrio, and Barroco a few too many times and need to change it up. Plus it's close and we really like sitting at their bar. If we didn't live in Lakewood and have so many great Latino food choices, the rating might be higher."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm kind of shocked about all the bad reviews here on Yelp! Like many others, used to got to the Kent TT semi-often, and loved it. Sure, the burritos aren't necessarily authentic, but I've given up on authentic Mexican in NE Ohio anyway. 

Initially I was put off by the \"meh\" reviews here, and kind of dragged my heels about going. But then a friend posted a picture of the daily specials board yesterday and I knew I had to stop in before work. What drew me in? The \"Kick-Ass Kale\" special. I'm glad I went, because it was one of those rare moments when I got exactly what I wanted and was perfectly happy with my lunch. My crispy, baked burrito was full of a whole mess o' kale as promised, no skimpy greens portion here! Along with that, it contained roasted potatoes, corn, poblano peppers, onions, sour cream, tomatoes, and a butt-load of cheese. Effin delicious! If you are not the biggest fan of cheese, I'd recommend asking the kitchen to go light, because there was A LOT of it. No complaints here though. My boyfriend got the steak burrito and it was also delicious.

The wait time was not bad. 15 minutes to eat in two burritos assembled from scratch and baked? Not sweating a 15 minute wait. I think people have just become used to going down the line at Chipotle. You'd wait that long or longer at any other restaurant. 

My only minute complaint is that the mild and hot salsa had exactly the same heat level and tasted very similar. That said, I preferred the flavor of the mild. 

Oh, and the bill? $14. 

Thank goodness for Taco Tonto's. You're there for me when I crave something better than the big C and have a little more time to spare. Before you, I had to suffer the abuses and erratic opening/closing times of El Tango, but no more! I'll be back, and hopefully not before work so I can try some of the signature margaritas!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite taco in Cleveland. My opinion may be influenced because I went to Kent and was indoctrinated there. When I moved to Lakewood and they followed me, it seemed like a sign.

If you like good, fresh, no-frills tacos, this is the place for you. No weird gimmicks, just fresh food. The double layer taco is delightful. Both the guac and cheese \"glues\" rock. Tostadas = A+. Margaritas = A+ Really, you can't go wrong. They have two types of house made hot sauce on the table which are equally delicious. I think you can buy it too. Word to the wise, the tacos are bigger than you'd expect so order accordingly.

The only drawbacks are that it's small so if they're busy you might have a decent wait. There's also only street parking, but there's enough around the place so unless it's freezing out, it's no biggie. Plus, meter parking in Lakewood is free after 6pm and on weekends. These reasons may be why they have such a good take out business.

The staff is great and very nice even when busy. I've never had bad service. The prices are also reasonable which doesn't hurt!"}
{"text":"From the food and drink to the amazing staff this place is my all time favorite taco spot!!! 
Plus they do an amazing catering!!"}
{"text":"This place is a local eatery. Very small and love the style of the inside. We came on a Thursday evening and got seated pretty quickly. 
We started with the chips, queso, and salsa. This was by far the best part of the meal. The chips are thicker and have a nice crunch to them. The queso was warm and just enough spice. The salsa was pretty decent as well. For our meals we ordered the burrito bowls. I had the sweet potato and black bean. To be honest it was a bit bland. However, luckily we also ordered the sauce sampler. I really liked some of the sauces! My favorite was the chipotle... Really smoky and a good amount of heat. That made my entree much better. My hubs ordered the chicken burrito bowl. He felt that there was too much rice, but I didn't taste it. 
Overall this place wasn't bad. I'd like to come back at a later date to try some of the tacos on the menu (rather than the burrito)."}
