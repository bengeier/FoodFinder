{"text":"I love Italian and have eaten at many Italian restaurants and this is the best pasta I have ever had! My husband and I went there for AZ Restaurant Week.  The place has a very cozy atmosphere and very warm and friendly people.  Our waitress Daniella was excellent.  We started off with the bread, which was amazing!! Then we had our incredible appetizers - it was so hard to choose one because the descriptions made them all sound wonderful!  We both ended up choosing the same entrée, which was the lobster stuffed shells.  OMG!  (this is what we both said after the first bite) Each bite totally melted in our mouths and the sauce was rich creamy and unbelievably delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try another entrée.  And the pizza looked really good too.  Our desserts were also awesome.  There were absolutely no negatives whatsoever with our experience there.  We are DEFINITELY coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Great bread and the food tastes fantastic. Friendly wait staff. Did mess my initial order up but were very apologetic and correct food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"by far one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at. Greeted by a pleasant lady she immediately sat at a table. no reservations me and my girlfriend order two dishes the pescatore which was a seafood mixture (clams, scallops, shrimp) and the classic shrimp scampi. the pescatore dish was complimented by a light but flavorful tomato sauce over linguine. the scampi was more on the light zesty side with a white wine base (defiantly how scampi is suppose to be made). Although the pescatore was good I just wish my pasta was al dente.   finishing our entrees I was curious about dessert. Very Impressed with our waiter recalled and described every dessert on the menu. I ended up getting the cheesecake; imported from Italy it was light with a cake-like texture, very different than what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service.  I loved the home made ravioli stuffed pumpkin!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight based on reviews. Very good! Juan was the best waiter ever and the food was very tasty. Nice family business."}
{"text":"Great food! Dinner was kinda of pricey. Lunch was much more affordable. Have tried and loved the fettuccini, lasagna, grilled chicken sandwich, pizza and calamari. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the price. The restaurants decor and vibe doesn't make it worth the higher prices."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp, went to another Italian restaurant but it was mobbed So did a quick search and I am so glad the other place was packed. No reservation but got seated within 5 min, very friendly service and the food was excellent. My wife got the penne primavera and loved it and my eggplant parm was just as good. Topped it off with a slice of delicious  cheesecake. We will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"Hard to find place, but we found it by a friend referral  hidden off of Thunderbird road and Scottsdale Road (NE corner behind a storage facility)  This place reminds me of being in little Italy in New York. OUTSTANDING. service is slow and a bit disorganized, but it is perfect - we have not had a bad thing on the menu. My only problem has become the fact I can only order one entrée at a time!!  to avoid some of the issues with the slow service, we had started to order 'to-go' and always pick up the food to eat at home. We have a running joke about the food from NY BEST!! - 'if this spills and hits the floor - we would still eat it and enjoy it!\" Food is perfect and good Italian at a VERY FAIR VALUE price is hard to find!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for years, and yes, there have been some very significant changes recently. New chef, new, and smaller menu...but...there is a difference for the better. I had the caprese recently, which is fresher, tastier, and of higher quality than their old version. An old standard at many Italian restaurants, cacciatore, had the creamiest polenta base outside of Italy, with perfectly done chicken thigh. The house made Italian cheesecake, is inspiring ! If you haven't been, go...If you've been before, keep an open mind and try it again..it's new and improved, and you will be welcomed !"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Having found this restaurant from great reviews on Yelp - decided to give it a go. My husband has been on the hunt for the best spaghetti Bolognese in the valley! and he found it!!!! The grilled peaches - amazing The Chicken masala - best ever   Creme Brulle - have only amazing things to say about it  and of course the Spaghetti Bolognese - this is by far the best I have ever tried!  Best Italian food around!!"}
{"text":"I ate there last night, I had the basil crusted Ono with orzo. It was awesome! The food seems to be going in a great direction and I enjoyed it! I'm definitely going back there soon."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food I've ever had. Everything here is just incredible. I love that everything is imported from Italy, if not made from scratch. The waiters are very welcoming, personable and make it obvious that they care deeply about the quality of food, service, and the customer experience."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend.  Does NOT disappoint.  Excellent food and very friendly service.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Our server was very nice, and the owner stopped by to say hello. Our water glasses were always full, and our table was kept nice and clean.  The food is very good, and it is definitely reasonable for the price. The only complaint is that some of the food is VERY heavy. It felt a bit like a brick was in my stomach after we were done eating. Also, I heated up my leftover pasta the next day, and it was very easy to see all the oil that my pasta was drenched in.  All in all, great service and good food."}
{"text":"what a find!!!!  now this is not your typical Scottsdale joint, this is simply awesome food without all the pretense; prepared and served by good people.  How this joint has not been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (triple D) escapes me... the quintessential triple D place. As he says on the show, 'i would eat this food off my flip-flop!'  I have been here for lunch (great lunch specials), dinner and take-out (my personal favorite)  good food, good people without the Scottsdale pretense - if you need white linen table clothes, or expect someone to dote on you, forget it here - this is like being in your mother's kitchen - and by the way - Mama's Gravy is available only on Saturday nights (and they sell out of it often)"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Found this place using a Yelp search. Hidden gem. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"OMG!  Fantastic! Come early on a Saturday night and order the mama's gravy special.  You will not be disappointed.  They sell out by 7:00 and i understand why. The only thing I am disappointed about is that I did not find this place sooner. On weekends you will need a reservation. Try the eggplant rollitini appetizer. Delish! The cannoli is the best I have ever had.  It rivals Mike's Pastry in Boston.  This place is full of regulars and the owner knows everyone's name."}
{"text":"Valentines Day Date Night!   At first I was a little skeptical, a little restaurant next to a airport! Aye Aye AYe. We got there before the 'dinner' rush since we live in Peoria,AZ so the place was empty beside the kitchen staff having their pre-rush supper.  Little did I know that this place would KnOcK my TasteBuds socks OFF! Once our watier, who I think had to have been an owner, starting telling us the specials with great detail my mouth was watering.  Appetizer: Carppaccio en salade (artichokes, fresh mozzaelle, balsamic, olives) 5/5 My Dinner: Fresh Lobster Ravioli with marinara sauce (instead of the special sauce which had mushrooms which I am highly allergic) 5/5 --I could have licked my plate! My Husbands Dinner:  Linguine Pescatore amazing!! 5/5 Dessert: Cheescake. good. 4/5 However the way our waiter explained the cannoli is peaked my interest. I am not typically a cannoli type of girl, I decided to give it a go. I AM SOOO GLAD I DID. That little piece of heaven was fantastic.. crunchy, cinnamony, creamy. I almost didn't share it with my husband.. haha. 5/5  Highly recommend and can't wait to go again!!   Awesome Food!"}
{"text":"Great little casual, NY Italian spot that we keep coming back too."}
{"text":"I have been there several times over the last few month and have to say it's one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley. It is very comfortable,the service extremely attentive and the food is always good & fresh. The best part is the pizza,living in New York most of my life and tasting the best around this is number 1. It is thin,chrispy and the cheese and sauce are outstanding. If you have room for desert this is not to missed as well. A little tricky to find as it's not in a strip center or a busy area but worth the drive & find. The best part is the owners are from the big apple (NYC )"}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the last.    Ambience - 1 Service - 1 Food - 2  Reminded us of a place headed for Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!!! We were here for a 4 day backpacking trip at the Grand Canyon, states nearby and stumbled upon this cute little Italian bistro.  The foods were delicious, but the staff truly makes it an unforgettable experience. We loved it so much that upon our return from backpacking returned to have an wonderful meal with excellent service and delicious tasting foods."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Chicken Calabrese was incredible. The Bolognese was very tasty.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch since it is walking distance from the office. I had been craving a Italian Sub. It was pretty good. It had fresh bread and was enough of a meal for a big guy, I will be going back to taste the pasta. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"There is no doubt in my mind that the New York Italian Bistro is one of the best Italian places in the city. Everything we've had is perfect and they have some of the best desserts at fair prices. Its in an out of the way spot in the Scottsdale Air Park. Friendly service completes this overall experience to make this the place to go in Scottsdale AZ. This is now on our permanent rotation."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!!!  I had dinner there last night with some friends and I was blown away with the quality and freshness of the food!  I had the baked ziti and it came out just like my grandma used to make.  Juan was our server and he was johnny on the spot when it came to questions about the menu.  Its definitely a hidden gem near the airpark, but if you want authentic Italian food you need to try this place!!  5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Excellent service and delicious food. I highly recommend the linguine and white clam sauce. All of the other dishes were fantastic as well. We will definitely be back when we visit Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've had in AZ. Closest to little Italy in NY.  Appetizer was grilled pizza dough topped with fig jam, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and drizzled with white truffle oil and balsamic glaze. Awesome!  We had Malbec  wine, the best eggplant parmesan with delicious tomato sauce. My husband had shrimp scampi--also very good. For dessert a comp cannoli (b-day) and imported peach sorbet served in a fresh peach. A go back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a little far away from everything, but it has great, authentic Italian food.  The best manicotti I've ever had."}
{"text":"Walked in with my wife and 5 year old daughter. the guy at the counter stared at us for over 30 seconds before i asked where we could sit. You can also see the kitchen and the cook [he definitely is no chef] looked like he was just working on his car. He immediately sneezed in someone's food he was cooking, then pulled a snot rag out of his pocket, started digging for gold, put it back in his pocket, snorted several times, wiped his hands all over his face, then continued to grab raw meat with his hands and toss it in a pan. We immediately left."}
{"text":"Sam N stay in Peoria!  That will probably fit with your taste buds better than Scottsdale!  I think the Italian Bistro is superb, the new owners, the staff and especially the FOOD!  Pam P. Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Best Italian food we've had in AZ! Attentive, efficient, and friendly service and an open-kitchen concept, plus an outside patio. It's at the tip of the Scottsdale Airport runway, not easy to find, but so worth it!!  They start you with a fresh-baked, piping-hot pillow of Foccacia bread with seasoned olive oil to dip it in. The Eggplant Rolletini appetizer was a special tonight, and thanks to another Yelp recommendation, we ordered it and it was out of this world.   We also had Lasagna (terrific) and the Filet Mignon Saltimbocca special with prosciutto, melted fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, and a marsala sauce with roasted potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce. Yummy tiramisu and slam-dunk Canollis. Everything tastes so fresh and delicious, head and shoulders above the Italian chains.   You need to try this place! : )"}
{"text":"I swear we've tried about every Italian rest in Scotts & Phx and been disappointed, but not this one!  Even better that its family owned. Tucked away by Scotts airport, tbird/Scotts rd.  go for dinner. homemade bread that is still warm that is delicious and order one of the specials. Chef made a special order meal for my picky son and I never saw him eat so much! Hubbie & split a bottle of wine. This place truly cares about its customers and service is outstanding! My only critique would be to sit in the area on the right when you first walk in- the ambiance is a little nicer, better decor & less white hairs.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. My family has lived close to this area for 12 years and I cannot believe it that I haven't been here until now!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night.  Made reservations through open table because I didn't know how busy it would be. There we're very few people there and were seated right away so reservations were not needed. Had a delicious glass of wine and ordered the bruschetta appetizer. It wasn't as warm as I thought it would be but was still good. A little heavy on the tomatoes. Now for the bread. The bread here is absolutely the best I have ever had in a long time. It was warm and the oil to dip it in made it even better. We ate two servings of it before our meals arrived. I had the cheese ravioli with a side of meatballs. I'm not a big fan of pasta but this was delicious. I would highly recommend this place for great Italian dining.  Our bill with tip was around 70. Pretty good for two meals, appetizer and 2 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Hard to find non-chain Italian restaurants near this area that are actually good! The bread is amazing and all of the sauces were actually delicious. Can really taste the quality and well worth the value. Treated like family here. Pasta was cooked perfect too. Will be going back many times."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write. It's feels as if we have just broken up with our with our best friend.  We have frequented this establishment for years. This has always been our go to Neighborhood restaurant. We have raved about it to friends, family and colleagues. The food has been stellar. Everything had been made with love and passion Every dish was special and unique. Something you wouldn't find anywhere else in the Valley.  We are so disappointed about the most recent changes. The kitchen staff has turned over, all the unique Specials that set New York's Best Italian above any other restaurant in town are gone, The prices are higher and portions smaller. The food is tasteless and worst of all not hot.   We find it insulting  that the new owners don't have any regard for their customers that have patronized this restaurant for years. They don't support the staff they have that have worked hard to make this restaurants a success.  It's insulting. You cannot serve an inferior product and expect people to keep coming back. There are so many wonderful restaurants in town that care about their food and their customer.  I hope the problems can be corrected.  For now we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a horrible dining experience. Six people at dinner and half of the entrees were completely messed up. Our server was one of the worst I've ever had. A couple of us were offered a complimentary glass of wine but when the bill arrived we were charged for them. The owner/manager thought that offering us some cannoli's would resolve the terrible food and service but even they weren't that great. Then he decided to stick around the table and talk about baseball for 15 minutes while we were still trying to finish our meal. After the cannoli's the server tried to sell us more dessert.  I'm honestly confused by the number of great reviews for this place, our dinner was the total opposite."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food experience I have had in Arizona.  The food was 10/10 The service was 10/10 The prices are more than fair.  The owner is very involved, checks on tables and even helps bring food out, fill waters etc.  I will be going back here plenty of times and I am looking forward to trying it.  Their bread is to die for and the service is the icing on the cake. Thanks Juan for the 5 star service!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say other then amazing.  Let me preface this with a quick statement, I own a business about a mile from here and had often come in for lunch.  The pizza slices and salad are awesome, by far one of the best pizza's I have had out here.  My wife and often said we should come for dinner and let me tell you, we are SOOOO glad we did.  The service was fantastic, Patrick was so helpful and very professional.  He help make everything better.  The food, well I can't say enough good things about it.  I had the Gnocchi and it was by far and away the best I have ever had.  My wife had the fettuccine Alfredo and you could taste the fresh cream in it.  Everything was super fresh and rustic.  Will be telling everyone we know about it."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere, affordable pricing, and delicious food. The service was tremendous. The location is a little out of the way and the venue is nothing to marvel at but it gets the job done. This has become one of my favorite italian restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Thinking about moving to Scottsdale, New York's Best Italian Bistro is one reason to move here tomorrow.       I'm a New Yorker visiting for one week, and my son found the restaurant online.     For that I will be forever thankful.  The food was great, so was the conversation with John, also from the Bronx.  No need to review what we ate, no need to review the desserts or the wine. Believe me, visit New York's Best Italian Bistro and you won't be disappointed.  If you are, write to me, and I will refund the cost of your meal.  The true meaning of a five star restaurant.  Lewis"}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had.  My 60th birthday and I made my reservation over a week ago through Open Table  only to be told, upon arrival that we did not have a reservation.  We were seated at a thrown together combination of two mis- sized tables right next to the kitchen.  My dinner and my mother's arrived cold. My carbonara was served with raw pancetta, no peas (because they didn't have any) and the wrong pasta.  The provided spaghetti instead of rigatoni.  The portion sizes were so small that my daughter and her husband left hungry.  Who serves bread a with an overly acidic vinegar dressing prior to the meal? We waited 1 hour and 35 minutes for this less than memorable meal. My mothers remade meal took so long she asked for a doggy bag.  At that point we gave up and asked for a check.  Thanks for my milestone birthday dinner - not!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best tasty clean Italian restaurant in town! I'm in love with their dishes and always coming for more! The service is fabulous too, the owner is the best!"}
{"text":"When they say \"Best\" I'm not sure if they mean the food or the service, but either way they are RIGHT!  My drink was never empty, the staff was super informed, very friendIy, and welcoming!  I had the gnocchi and it was, tender, not too dry and clearly expertly hand made!  And the sauce?  To die for!  I don't know what they put in it, but it has this distinctly different flavor, in the best way possible!   Then!  THEN there are the canollies!  Canollies so delicious, so authentic, I'm relatively certain they have angles making them in the back! I don't care where in the valley you live, this place is worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for a weekend trip to Phoenix and found this gem. I had the eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the chicken Parmesan and a slice of pizza. Everything was delicious. Super friendly staff and excellent food. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I will not be returning.  The food was terrible, I got a salad and it was like they went to the supermarket and got the worst cold cuts you can buy out of a package and stick them in my $12.00 salad.  We also ordered pasta and a pizza, there is no way that this is New York's Best Italian Bistro.  I am from NY and this does not even come close.   The staff did not even know the Happy Hour specials or anything,  I am sorry to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.  I have been a customer of Giuseppe's for the past 3 years and wanted to try something new, I am sorry that I did.  Hopefully they get there food and service together because I would hate to see this place go out of business."}
{"text":"Very good food and pleasant atmosphere. My husband and I celebrated an anniversary there while on vacation. We were very happy with the entire experience, that we had found this gem. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good egg plant parmigiana  Lasagna was perfect Friendly staff Nice environment  Recommend you come here for Italian food Linda"}
{"text":"My office used to be just down the street, so I decided to try it as I am always looking for a hidden gem.  I found it here.  I have only eaten lunch, but have never once been disappointed.  I usually get the hot italian sandwich, which is out of this world.  I also enjoy their hippie rolls and calzones, which are unreal as well.  I now take clients to this spot whenever it is convenient.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner last night, good service very friendly staff. We had the Marsala and pasta special and would recommend both"}
{"text":"The food was great!  Service outstanding!  We had a great time.  I ordered the cheese ravoli with pear and it was so delicious!  Everyone raved about their food.  It was our last night in Scottsdale and we felt we ended with a wonderful restaurant!  I would go back often if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Family owned and operated. Service was very good and staff was sooo friendly. Had pasta for lunch...manicotti was delicious.  Server recommended spemonni for dessert... Holy crap it good!    The open kitchen allowed us to see staff cooking and spinning pizzas. (You could hear them singing as well).   I would have liked to have seen the runway of the airport but overall it was a great place with great food and staff."}
{"text":"Awful service as we entered , we were told the only availability was at the bar in a rude manner ignored and shunned away. Very rude and will not return.."}
{"text":"Me and my friend stopped by here today for some lunch. The table we sat at was dirty with crumbs and food. Rather than moving us to a different table the waitress just brushed them off. We ordered the vegetarian pizza. Living in NY for many years I feel I am a little harsh on \"authentic NY pizza.\" But this was AWFUL. It was so thick...reminded me of frozen pizza. Our waitress also left halfway through. For the rest of the time we had no service. I went inside to ask for the bill and everyone that worked there was sitting down and eating. Which is fine but it would have been nice to have been checked in on ONCE. He brought the bill and we waited for what seemed like forever until I finally got fed up and brought it over to the employees table. I felt like I was interrupting their meal. Rather than running my card he stayed their and finished his conversation (and food)- then got up to run it. Needless to say I will never be back to NY Best Italian Bistro. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Solid, traditional Italian fare here.  Everything is good, but nothing is transcendent.  Was hoping for more based on all the rave reviews- this place delivers, but not to the level I was expecting.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Just perfect. Hidden away next to the airport like a gem for the Med, this clearly family owned establishment hit all the right marks.   Handmade ravioli with veal? Spectacular. My 9 year old got this as the daily special and I had to fight him for the last one so I could try it.   I had the catch of the day, a tilapia filet that had to be 8-10oz with pasta and Roma tomato sauce with mussels and clams. Perfectly seasoned and cooked.   Didn't try anything from the dessert menu but we will definitely be back for another try. I do recommend calling ahead or reservations as our party of six was a scramble to find seating on a Friday evening at 6pm.   Really loved this place!!"}
{"text":"A real hidden gem in the Scottsdale area.  Been to New York's Best Itailan Bistro multiple times over the last year and have never been disappointed.  Great Italian food, and there are always multiple specials each day.  I almost always get the chicken parmesean, which is the best I've ever had.  The employees are always very nice and happy to serve you as well.  All in all it is my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoneix."}
{"text":"My first visit was for lunch yesterday and I'm very impressed. Great food, prices and atmosphere. All of the staff,especially John, were very professional and courteous. I had the lasagna and was very pleased with it, my wife had spaghetti with sausage and that was awesome also. Looking forward to going back soon but this time for dinner, as the dinner menu has a lot more offerings......can't wait to try the veal parm!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when Italian food is craved. All of the menu items I've had have been excellent but the speacials are always to die for!"}
{"text":"How has this place been around for twenty years without me in it? This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant and I'm pretty obsessed with Italian food!   Everything I've tried here is delicious and seasoned to perfection. The staff is amazing and always friendly. The owner is there frequently and welcomes everyone with a smile.   Try the ravs, the ziti, something with pesto or really, anything. I'm always looking for excuses to go here. Don't miss out like I did for the last couple decades!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!! Great service,  the food is delicious, and they're from New York. Real Italian food you can trust!!"}
{"text":"I was raised in New York City and lived in the North End section of Boston and spent tons of time in Italy so I have EXTREMELY high standards when it comes to food--especially Italian food and this place not only meets my standards but exceed my expectations. It wasn't \"good enough for Scottsdale\" but good enough like I was in New York or the North End or Venice. It was f*ckin good.  Decor wise it's nothing fancy but you go to a restaurant to eat and not to stare at a wall, right?  I had the eggplant parm and it was cooked to perfection. Husband and I shared an appetizer of calamari and it was delicious. Sadly, we didn't save room for dessert :( next time for sure we will!  Service was excellent. Felt I was like back at home.  Why are you still reading this? Go here, NOW!"}
{"text":"Went here over the Thanksgiving holiday with all the family, 12 of us. The service was great and the food was very good for Arizona standards. I would definitely come back here. The kids loved the pizza, NY style of course. I am happy to gave found this place and will go back regularly."}
{"text":"Came here for my husbands birthday based on Yelp reviews and I'm so happy that we did! John was our server and he was fabulous. He was so friendly and offered some wonderful options. We each had one of the specials for the evening and they did not disappoint. My husband had the mushroom ravioli and I swear it was gone in seconds! I had a seafood dish(sorry I don't recall the name) and that was also exceptional. Seafood was fresh and flavourful. John also recommended a wine and it paired beautifully with our meal. Coming from outside Chicago we have missed quality and authentic Italian food. We now know where to go for delicious Italian food and its New York's Best Italian Bistro! Don't hesitate come here for wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is malto bene! The owner is honest and sincere and has a love for his business. The waiter was great and was really good with the kids. Linen tablecloths and napkins, I felt underdressed in khakis and a polo! But everyone was dressed casual....  The antipasto salad served 2 adults and 3 boys.... Fantastic with fresh meats and cheeses, crisp lettuce and artichoke hearts.  The saltimbocca was wonderful and the gnocchi's were cooked perfect.  Enjoy this little, tucked away bistro....ask for a grappa.... Really generous and good tasting!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Easily in the top three best Italian restaurants I've ever been to, and that's coming from an Italian. Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit to this place was a disappointment compared to our first visit. We shared a small sausage pizza and a small salad. The sausage was scant, as was the cheese. The salad was very small, but it tasted good with the Italian dressing.   Our first visit was far more satisfying when we shared the generous stromboli sandwich. We would get that again if we return.   In general this is not a very friendly place. The owner seems preoccupied and few employees smile and greet guests in a welcoming manner. They could make the place more fun than it is."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars because the food is delicious and the atmosphere makes you feel great to be out for a nice dinner. I dine here regularly with family, friends and clients. John the manager, Susan the owner and the friendly wait staff are always warm and welcoming.  That is why this past weekend, New York's Best was our choice to hold  a special private party for 42 people. John's menu gave our guests the choice among 5 delicious and diverse entrees, 5 appetizers and 2 deserts all made to order. They set up a side of the restaurant that gave us the semi privacy we needed while creating a casual sophisticated fun atmosphere. The food was delicious, the party fantastic and we have received very high compliments from all our guests which I am passing on here.  I enthusiastically recommend New York's Best for dinner or lunch. You will love the food, be greeted like family and the staff will let you know through their excellent service and sincere smiles how much they appreciated your business.   New York's Best Italian Bistro is always a 5 star experience on every level and the reason people go out to eat!  Larry Crown Scottsdale  This is an update of my review posted on 9/19/16 because Yelp removed it for no reason.  On 9/17/16, I celebrated my 60th birthday with friends and family. I wrote a bonafide review praising New York's Best because it deserved the high compliments. I am disappointed that Yelp removed this review. I request my review and this update be posted. It is independent, well deserved and honest.  Larry Crown  Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Definitely not a bad place. Good selection, good food, nice staff, and excellent bread with a dipping sauce that is awesome! They have a full bar too including beer and wine. However, none of the food was truly amazing. Nothing made me say, \"that was the best that I ever had\". You would not make a mistake dining here and I definitely would come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here the other night. We had not been here in many years. It is located at the end of one of the Scottsdale Airpark runways. Walking into the restaurant resembles being transported back to the old Italian restaurants from the 50's and 60's in New York or Philadelphia. The restaurant is long and narrow with old Italian paintings and large marble statues -nothing modern about it. The menu consists of old Italian comfort foods from southern Italy. The food was very good. I had the chicken picatta and it was delicious. There was plenty of chicken and a small amount of spaghetti. My husband had the Lasagna, which was very authentic and he said it was one of the best he has had. The owner was a throwback of the old Italian restauranteur barking orders at this staff on a continual basis. The highlight of the meal was the focaccia bread - outstanding. Service was pretty good but very slow. Prices were high but comparable to neighboring Italian restaurants and everything was a la carte. We will probably return when we have a yen for Italian food."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Arizona! The staff was very impressive and the God was like being back in NYC. It's a nice quiet location that if you don't know it's there you will miss it. I had the baked ziti and it was impressive. I gave it 6 meatballs because this place is going to be hard to beat...."}
{"text":"New York's best is a great place to stop in for lunch.  The staff is friendly and the food is quality.  A menu change seems to have caused issues with some old timers that hate change.  Don't let that sway you because trying new things can be very refreshing.  This is a great place to eat give it a shot and you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"This is your go-to-spot if you are in the mood for authentic Italian food. Without a doubt, it is the best in the area. Every time I have been here, I have been sincerely WOW-ed by the quality of the food, service, and overall experience.   The owners are talkative, informative, down to Earth, approachable, genuine, and overall great people. Not only that, but also, the service is extremely knowledgeable, experienced, attentive, helpful, and have great senses of humor. I have found that there is always a friendly staff member around to help you out or to answer any of your questions. Although, the interior is simple with no frills, there is a certain, classic charm to it. The lighting is dim and romantic. Customers also have an option to sit outside on the patio. I haven't sat outside here yet but it looks nice!   As for the beverages and cuisine, you will unquestionably be impressed. There is a vast wine and food selection--there is something for everyone here. My biggest problem is deciding what to order! Once I do decide, our table is always served warm, moist bread baked to perfection with flavorful oil. In terms of entrees, so far I have tried:   -Seafood Spaghetti Carbonara (creamy perfection and creative originality)  -Scallops Alla Verdi (the only sounds I consistently made while devouring this masterpiece were grunts and groans of foodie heaven) -Sacchetti Con 4 Formaggio e Pere (this dish was literally divine. I will tell you that it is very rich and a lot of butter was used. The touch of sweet flavoring was well received by me. The portion size is just right) -Linguine with clams with white clam sauce (a classic, light, and nonetheless tasty as hell dish)   Make sure to save some room in your tummies because you will not want to miss dessert! I have tried the canoli and chocolate cake--both were delicious!   It is safe to say that I will be back here many more times due to the impeccable quality of our food and experiences. They know exactly what is up in the foodie world and continue to rock their dishes to the maximum. The Italian food here is SO GOOD...I couldn't recommend NY's Best Italian Bistro enough!"}
{"text":"Wow...great  food  wine and service.  Family  owned and original made to order entrees.  Just in from out of state and so glad we picked this place."}
{"text":"We came in 20 mins before closing time on a Saturday night. The owner met us at the door and was very welcoming.  The food was fantastic and Juan our server was kind and friendly. Service food were all great  The restaurant was off the beaten track but it was worth finding it. I will be back"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Nice, casual atmosphere.  Had eggplant parmigiana, husband had lasagna, shared a small antipasto salad (plenty for 2) and spumoni for dessert.  Everything was delicious, the prices were reasonable and the service was wonderful too.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really great.  Fresh Pappardelle with Pesto for me, Chicken Parm for my husband.  Both wonderful!"}
{"text":"Big portions, fast and friendly service.  Feels like I was back in The Bronx"}
{"text":"Just like the best of New York/New Jersey"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants around. Tommy Morano has been cooking in Scottsdale for over 30 years. He has a huge following of fans and the best thing is that the quality of the food is always consistent. John , the manager - aside from being a Yankee fan - is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. I have neer een there without a visit to the table from Jon and - if he is there - Tommy to make sure that everything is perfect. Five stars aren't enough!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Excellent Italian food. Wonderful flavors. Party of five and we are all anxious to come back."}
{"text":"Very family friendly! I ate there tonight with my wife and 4 kids ages 8, 6, 4 and 7 mos. the food was incredible and the service was outstanding. We are from NY and this place certainly is the Best of NY! I had the Veal Parm which was outstanding! The sauce was so delicious. My wife had the Penne al la vodka and she loved eat. We also had buscuitto to start and it too was very good. My kids had a plain cheese pizza, baked pasta and penne with sauce on the side. All were excellent. We finished the meal with italian ice, mango and lemon. Needless to say we are very satisfied, full and happy we found such a delicious place to eat  italian food in the valley. Absolutely the best in the Valley. go try it you wont be disappointed.   PS - the service is second to none, not once did I need to ask for something or have to wait for the table to be cleared. They are very attentive but not in an overbearing way."}
{"text":"We have now made three visits to New York's Best Italian Bistro, and each visit has convinced us that this \"sleeper\" restaurant is one of the best Southern Italian restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Tucked away in an industrial area next to the runway at Scottsdale Airport, it is not a place you would just stumble upon.  However, I suggest you whip out your GPS device and get to this little gem of a restaurant ASAP.  Dinner starts with a nice, hot loaf of bread with olive oil.  We shared a dinner salad to start, a simple salad with Italian dressing.  They have wines by the glass and bottle as well as various beers, plus various cocktails.  Besides the indoor dining there is an outside dining area, with a view of a darkened runway.  I presume noise is not an issue, as there are no commercial flights at Scottsdale Airport.    Every day there are various specials, and I opted for one of these, chicken breast with mushrooms, peppers on a bed of pasta with red sauce.  They included it with a side of vegetables (broccoli and carrots).  Could I substitute sautéed spinach?  No problem.  Because the food here is always made from scratch, it does not always come out in 5 or 10 minutes, but it DOES come out hot and delicious.  My lovely bride opted for calamari parmigiana.  She thought it could have been crispier, but still she felt it was properly cooked (not rubbery) and very tasty.  We both felt, based on multiple visits, this will be one of our go-to spots.  The service is quick and the restaurant is quiet, which makes it ideal for romantic conversation (or even unromantic conversation)!  We both gobbled down too much bread, so we did not explore the dessert menu, so that will wait for a future visit."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path by the airport with bar and outdoor seating in addition to main area. Authentic Mew York Italian staff.   Lunch me menu is limited compared to dinner menu.   Good food. Reasonable prices.   Spimoni was excellent, good house Chianti."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. Unfortunately the food was barely mediocre. I had the clams in white wine and garlic sauce and although the sauce was palatable, the clams were chewy and tasteless. We also had the spaghetti with meat sauce, which was very typical and hamburger-y. Definitely feel like we could have had much better Italian food in the area for the same price. Shame."}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch here after reading the reviews. It is pretty good though not perfect.  At lunch, you order at the counter and food and beverages will be brought to you. As we were driving to this place, we had a discussion in which we agreed that we don't patronize restaurants that have counter service. As we were trying to decide whether or not to stay, we were told that we could have table service.  There is table service at dinner. I had an antipasti salad which was great. My wife had a burger which she declared great. Friends had pasta and a beef and pepper sandwich. Everyone was happy with their meal. I had two glasses of red wine which I enjoyed. I liked them even more when I realized I was paying a reverse happy hour price.  We decided we couldn't find room for dessert.  Service was good.  We looked at the dinner menu and decided we should return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend !!!  The whole dinner from start to end was great.  Service and food authentic.  Best bruschetta I have ever had, this includes little Italy in NY."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the chicken picatta is to die for! We've been here 5 times and I order it every time (hubby usually gets one of the specials and is always impressed). As of tonight, New York's Best has earned the coveted title of \"our spot\". :)"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place.  My kids love it too.  Goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in prosciutto are yummy"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Service was great!  I usually go 2-3 times a year and will need to go more often.  Their seafood plates are the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  We were in Scottsdale just 3 nights and ate here twice!! Service was so friendly yet they were wonderful at keeping a distance (ie they never interrupted nor were in a hurry to clear plates - my pet peeves!), food was so fresh and authentic, bread and oil so great, salads tasty, all 4 entrees we had over the 2 nights were delicious, just a fantastic place. We love hole in the wall Italian and this was perfect. Do save room for dessert - spumoni and Canolli were so delicious. We didn't encounter a wait either night but it was busy.  Definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"***** REVISED***** BACK TO 5 STAR!  Due to the kindness of the owner and possibly a manager of the darling establishment, that both took the time to send me a message about my review..explaining they have gone back to the \"old\" incredibly delicious menu, WE RETURNED!!! I was back to its \"old self\".... MENU IS BACK, FOOD QUALITY IS BACK,!!!  This is definitely back on our \"favs\" list!! KUDOS TO OWNER AND MANAGER,!  We have been to this gem at the end of the runway numerous times on the past several years... Sadly, tonight will be our last visit. There has been a change in ownership, management and kitchen staff. The once wonderfully diverse menu, is now nothing but generic offerings. No more warm homemade bread loaf.... now you get store bought 1/2 slice thin dry ordinary bread.  No more gnocchi. No more marsala. No more veal ( which I don't eat, anyway). No more bolgonase.  No more unique items... When we questioned the missing menu items, we were told there is a new chef and there were too many options to be managed. Granted, the menu was extensive, but cutting the wonderful menus by 2/3rds, and leaving just the run of the mill menu is a huge mistake! The clientele remained faithful to this \"mom&pop\" place because it was like eating an mama's house on Sunday night. Now it's a bad night at Olive Garden.. The arrogance of this new chef/management, to think they can make subpar substitutions, changes and deletions and expect the customer to remain, is ludicrous.  I am sorry to see this establishment go down in flames, but it well on its way...  If the previous owners are out there... PLEASE, PLEASE come back and save what you worked so hard  to build... unfortunatly, your hard work and reputation is not going out with a bang...its going out with a painful wimper.  The days of recommending this place are over. Never again.  Sad."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Patio dining was very relaxing.  Beer cup was completely frozen both times. Pizza was fantastic as well as the pasta dishes. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"To New Yorkers, Arthur Avenue in the Bronx is a special place. There, you can find some of the best Italian delis in the entirer city.  And if you like Italian food, and we love Italian food -- it's like a little bit of heaven.  We came to New York's Best Italian Bistro (NYBIB) recently and were  warmly welcomed by owners Donna (photo) and her husband.  After a chance encounter nearly twenty years ago (which led to their engagement and marriage), they started this restaurant.  True story.    Today they have the entirer family working here, serving mostly northern Italian cuisine.  A simple way of looking at it -- think more butter and less olive oil and garlic.  How many restaurants go out of their way to warmly greet their patrons as they come in. Really? No handing of a pager here. LOL  EVERYTHING, is good on the menu. Yes, we've tried most of it. The pastas, the chicken, pizza, desserts; nothing is bad. I've posted a bunch of photos to help get your salivary glands working.  Expect to pay $25 each, plus tip and gratuities."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  My husband had chicken parm., I had chicken marsala and our son had ravioli.  All of us enjoyed our meal and being from Long Island, NY appreciated the NY family that runs the place.  It was very quiet since we went early on a Thursday evening but that was ok."}
{"text":"First time I go to an Italian place, I usually go with spaghetti or lasagna. In my opinion, if you're doing those right, there's a good chance the rest of the menu is well done. The lasagna is crazy good.  My wife got the pear ravioli. It has a brown butter sauce and is drizzled with amazing balsamic. Two for two, people. The bread? Good. Wine? Great selection. Service? Great. Ambiance? A little Goodfellas-ish without trying to be. To me, it feels like an Italian restaurant, not some high-end nuevo-fusion bistro, which i loved. I was wondering if there was a pull chain toilet in the bathroom with a snub nosed pistol taped to the back (guys will get this, ladies). The desserts are classic Italian and fantastic. If you're in the Kierland Commons area, skip Brio one time and try this place out. It'll be the one place that, when you say, \"I just want good Italian food\", you'll get it."}
{"text":"Ate there about two months ago , Mussels over Linguini, Very good Need to go back soon ."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and the food was incredible! It is tucked back off the \"beaten path\" but don't let that fool or deter you from checking it out. If you are from Chicago or NY you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! It rivals food I've had in both of those locations (and then some)! I ordered the fettucini pesto and my wife got the baked pasta - both were fantastic. We also started with their calamari which was above average and finished off the dinner with tiramisu and cappuccino's. Sad to say, but the tiramisu here is so much better than my italian mother-in-laws (which is seriously good!). In the valley you will be hard pressed to find a better joint.  In addition to the food the wait staff, the owner(s), and the family atmosphere are amazing.  The Staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and let us know they appreciated our business.  We'll definitely be back.  There aren't many places like this left, so If you live/are in the area, be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"I returned here a few evenings ago with a party of 6.  The service and food was excellent as always.  I had the eggplant parm which was great and so was the Caesar salad.  We also ordered a large margarita pizza.  I didn't really like it that much because there wasn't enough cheese but I was told that is how it should be.  The crust however was phenomenal.  It was kinda on the thicker side, a bit crispy and a bit chewey.  It kinda sorta had the flavor and texture of a croissant.  I didn't confirm it, but it didn't matter because it was excellent."}
{"text":"Well, I couldn't stay away! It's just too close to home and I have had so many nice meals there. This time, we tried a chicken parm and a linguine with clams, which my husband says is fantastic! Every bit was delicious. Great service this time, too, with a new server who was helpful. Made us feel happy to be there, along with a nice young man, who is always there, and I think is the  hardest worker there, too. Keeps the place running, if you ask me. They also have a nice wine list.  I've tried many of the red wines by the glass and am always happy. Still a nice time of year to try the patio before it gets too hot! Service 5 stars Dinner 5 stars"}
{"text":"I love this place! Family-owned, amazing food. It's off the beaten path and not overly crowded. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a little gem this is! We had an amazing meal topped off with just as amazing service from Juan! The other server and busser couldn't have been any nicer or more attentive as well. My boyfriend had the chicken Marsala and loved it and I had eggplant stuffed with cheese that was also delicious! The bread to begin was delicious with yummy oil and vin dip, and we tried the bruschetta which was great! Must try tiramisu! We were too full to finish our meals but after finding out it was the owners recipe we had to and I am so glad I did! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"As an italian from New York, I was immediately directed to this restaurant by friends.  It did not disappoint.  In fact, it was a delightful surprise.  We were met at the door by the owner, who is originally from the Bronx little Italy.  The food was the best italian I've had in years (basically since nonna passed away).    I had the cavatelli in oil with broccoli and sausage - it was excellent.  My boys had lasagna (which as an italian, i rarely even allow them to order in a restaurant because it never is as good as homemade) and it was incredible.  One bite and you knew it was authentic italian homemade with real, fresh, creamy ricotta.  My daughter ate gnocchi in a wonderfully fresh and tasty homemade marinara, basil sauce."}
{"text":"Great Italian bistro ! i love family owned businesses that have great pride in their customers experiences.  My baseball team ate here and we all loved it.  The food was fresh and excellent and the wine was very reasonably priced and delicious.  i will be back ! i had the chicken spinach eggplant special on a bed of spaghetti. It was very fresh and delicious.  We had the California Pinot Noir which was very smooth, and delicious."}
{"text":"Important stuff first...1/2 off all bottles of wine Monday and Tuesday! Came in during off times and service was great. John even knew our favorite restaurant we eat at in little italy in New York! Had lasagna and shrimp risotto.  Lasagna was tasty but has a bit to go before it becomes my favorite. Lots of ricotta in it, if that's your thing. I ordered an extra side of marinara sauce because I love sauce...which was delicious. Risotto was more like a creamy Primavera with some risotto. Shrimp was just a tad overcooked but was still tasty. I think we might try them again.... we will see."}
{"text":"We went back twice while visiting!! This is truly a find.  I had the clam fettuccini and this was, hands down, the best I've ever had. Lots of choices in Scottsdale, but you won't be disappointed with this little gem."}
{"text":"Great food and great service for our party of eight including two kids.  Especially liked the spaghetti with sausage, onion, and peppers and, of course, the house Chianti."}
{"text":"We tried this place out and were glad we did. Excellent Italian food--with nice, soft bread--and good portion sizes. The wine wasn't bad, either."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo! Food was so good that I went back the next day and tried the pizza which was fantastic! I highly recommend this Bistro!"}
{"text":"Recent Management changes have brought a renewed zest and quality to this Gem of a Restaurant.  I dined there a few nights ago, and having been a \"regular\" for some time now,  can honestly say it was my best experience ever.  The Caesar Salad was fantastic and fresh, but the Risotto Con Gamberi was completely off the charts!  Tender grilled shrimp with artichoke hearts and asparagus mixed in with tasty risotto made for an incredible culinary treat.  My mouth is even watering writing this review, and I will be returning soon!  Go!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!   My wife and I started with the special of  Mussels with white wine--delicious.  The bread and dipping oil was great. We started also with inferno calamari.  Wow so good. The heat was moderate for  inferno which is really great because you could taste the wonderful marinara sauce. For the mains I had mama's gravy!  So amazing. Slow cooked sauce with lots of meats over rigatoni. Only available on Saturday and get there early, like before 6 otherwise it might be sold out. My wife had the Carbonara and said it was delicious.  We LOVE the place.  Our new favorite resturant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here 2 days ago.  First of all, the food was very good.  Our server was a little over-attentive with constant drink refills and asking how our meals were (after we already answered her).  The decor was a bit tacky...it seemed more like a cafe than a restaurant.  I became uncomfortable in the restaurant when the owner and servers would stand behind the dessert counter and look at us, then talk to each other, then look at us again and again...it was a little creepy.  I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Spaghetti Bolognese was really good.  This place is not on Scottsdale Rd.  Only a block off but it has no visability.  If it weren't for Yelp, I would have never found it.  May explain why I was their only customer at 6:30 pm.  Definately will be returning."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Calamari appetizer was great and our meals were fantastic. Had the eggplant parmigiana - will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We are here for the Arizona Bike Week from California.   Looking for an Italian restaurant.  Our first choice was closed but boy were we glad! The food was amazing! The staff & owners were wonderful. The portions were huge. We were so full we had to take some desert to go.  We will definitely come here again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Five  We found this great restaurant on YELP. John graciously welcomed us and he's really Italian from the  Bronx. Austin, our waiter, was super, taking good care of us throughout our delicious meal. We enjoyed the special flatbread arugula bruschetta appetizer with goat cheese. It was a bit spicy and quite tasty. My husband ordered gnocchi which was so tasty with great olive oil sauce and sausage. My choice was the dover sole in a lemon sauce with linguini. It's so nice to taste fresh lemon juice with the perfectly cooked sole. Enjoyed visiting with John who made our experience very personal. To complete our evening, we shared a conoli, made on location. If you're looking for an authentic Italian Restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Read some great reviews right here on Yelp and decided to have dinner here for my birthday. Dinner was excellent, the service was even better. Very personable and really cares. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I gave your restaurant a second try  thinking maybe you  were having  a bad day.    I am sorry to say  your changes that you have initiated   are a mistake.    Portions are very small.  Food quality is poor and cold .  No value for your money anymore  since you raised your prices.    You have lost the secret  formula   that made New York bistro a success for the past couple of year.  This restaurant is headed on a track to going out of business.  I hate to see a place close due to poor management but when you read the reviews over the past couple of months you  can see  why."}
{"text":"TRUE Italian straight from New York.  The ONLY Italian Restaurant in town that will customize your dish the way you like it. The entire staff, including the Owner, treat you like family.  Their name says it all and the food is second to none, even their pizza!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Perfect burgers, meatball sub, and salad.  Their Italian dressing is amazing. Their bread!!! Their bread!!! Oh my.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The best! I promise you will like the feel of this place. You will like the service and be amazed at the food. It is not what you would expect form its location. If you like Italian, this place is legit."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The food and the servers are fantastic! The location couldn't be more convenient! The gnocchi are to die for!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best Italian meal I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Superb service, flavors are traditional and spot on. The bread and dipping sauce create your first flavor explosion for the palate. Then the meal, oh so delicious! We had the chicken piccata and the bolognese. True flavors. Impeccable staff and atmosphere for fine dining experience. Must come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food with nice ambiance and outstanding service.  Off the beaten path, just a couple of blocks from Scottsdale Quarter.  Don't let the location or outside of the restaurant stop you from going in and enjoying this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Despite Grub Hub being VERY late to pick up my order (which made my food become soggy and cold), New York's Best Italian Bistro was fantastic!   My coworker and I enjoyed our sub and burger. We will for sure be ordering from here again; just not through Grub Hub.  Thank you so much for the yummy food!  Courtney @ Raintree Auto Body :)"}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian food in Arizona. Don't go here expecting to be impressed by the ambiance, but be ready for some delicious food. The owner is from Italy, and it shows in the food he serves."}
{"text":"Perfect in every way yet again."}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food was good but pricey for a neighborhood joint. $16 for mediocre calamari app...I have to say though, they have the best tiramisu i've ever had."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona wanting Italian food, yelped it and found New York bistro. Food was unbelievable, service was A++++, and prices were cheap. Could not be happier! Recommend any Italian food lover to this great establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent! In from ABQ read the reviews - stopped in. Great food, super friendly staff - loved it. Be sure to try the Chicken Parm."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've ever had (and I lived in North Beach in San Francisco). The second I walked in, the owner Tommy greeted me with a warm Italian welcome. Our Waiter John was amazing. The food was out of this world! From appetizers to desert I was impressed. 1. Sacchetti Con 4 Formaggio E Pere: Homemade pasta pouches. Filled with 4 cheeses and fresh pears in a brown butter sauce with romano cheese shavings. 2.Penne Alla Vodka: Penne with Tomato Vodka Cream Sauce  3.Fettuccine Alfredo"}
{"text":"This is more of a sandwich review than  a restaurant review. I can't honestly say I've experienced the best of what New York's Best Italian Bistro has to offer but I did like the italian sub. It had a good amount of quality ingredients, lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, but the bread was a bit heavy for my liking. I was also hoping the \"Italian\" would pop out in this sandwich; it seemed a bit masked by the quantity of plain ham. Swap out some of the ham for more salami, pep, or cap, lighten up the bread and boom, winner!"}
{"text":"Found this place from a recommendation in Sports Car Market. Excellent choice. Coming to Scottsdale for the car auctions for 10 years.  As a resident from South Jersey, I am an Italian food snob. This is the best Italian restaurant I have found in the Phoenix area. If you want good authentic Italian food- give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was scouring the Scottsdale area for a good Italian place to try with my mom. She picked this restaurant and I was a bit skeptical based on their name. Anything with \"best\" or a location in the name usually makes me wary. I was dead wrong this time.  FOOD: Delicious and fresh. I've had the best Italian food when I went to New York City. When I tasted the Chicken Parmesan here, I was in disbelief because it tasted exactly like what I had back in NYC. The best.  SERVER: Friendly and polite. Pretty above average.  HOSTING: I've made reservations thinking it would be packed, but it never has been. Always been able to get a seat even on a Saturday night.  AMBIANCE: Pretty standard romantic lighting. Feels a little like an Italian-deli inside. The patio is nice with a view of the Scottsdale airport.  You must try the Ricotta Cheesecake. Not only is it healthier than regular NYC style cheesecake, but it's imported and the perfect dessert in my opinion. I've been here multiple times and never been disappointed by anything. A must go if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Overall, an A-OK experience.  It's located oddly, in a commercial area right at the end of one of Scottsdale Airport's runway.  Interior: like a Mom-and-Pop restaurant that hasn't been updated in quite a few years, but I didn't notice it being particularly unclean, and I am pretty fussy about that.  (Too much Kitchen Nightmares and such!)  Our server was a super-nice girl, personable without being too much so, informed on the dishes, took care of us very efficiently.    I had the Branzino special and it was wonderful!  Our server told me that the chef makes each portion of the brandy cream sauce on order---no mass production.  So delicious, and a really nice portion!  My husband had the Chicken Caccitore,  He used to live in NJ, visited NYC often, and he LOVES Italian food.  He said this was some of the best Chicken Caccitore he'd ever had, and that's saying a lot.  We each had a house salad with the House Italian.  Nothing imaginative, but the greens were fresh and it was nicely presented.  The dressing was pretty good, not at all sweet, as happens occasionally when made in-house.  The bread was dreadful.  It was heavy and doughy and tasted a little raw.  We ordered the bruschetta, and they brought us a round of the bread that had been baked in the oven with the bruschetta on it.  It was more like a little pizza.  The bread was still awful and I now know I do NOT like baked bruschetta.  That was the big disappointment of the meal.    Would we go back?  You betcha!  I assume we just got a bad batch of bread because other Yelpers have raved about it.  And I just wouldn't order the bruschetta, since I don't like that style.  But the quality of the entrees certainly calls for a repeat visit.  With those caveats, I can recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner yesterday being a return customer, I will not be returning again. The calamari was tough, over cooked and freezer burned, and cold. I ordered chicken parmesan which was tough, dry and had no flavor, also came out not hot. These are not hard dishes to make, being Italian I look for quality Italian food. (This place is lacking in quality.) It will not be found here. Lastly instead of ordering a dessert and being disappointed again, I ordered an espresso. First of all the cup was not full the coffee was not made correctly, it was like mud and it wasn't hot at all.Very disgusted with the our whole dinning experience. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but today marks the day I review it.  The reason is because I took a girl out to lunch here, she had their slice of pizza, and there was a long hair under/in the cheese half way through eating it.  Gross!.  She lost her appetite, I felt like crap for telling her it was a good place.  The food is good as long as they hold the hair.  Didn't ask for a refund, but did get another slice for her, so she can attempt to overlook the previous one."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bread & oil I've ever had. Excellent, personable & friendly service. They treat you like family. Our food was excallent and the tiramisu was incredible light and tasty. Quite possibly the best Italian I've ever had."}
{"text":"Old school NY Italian cuisine and service.  My sausage and peppers pasta was super tasty.  Very good food and service in the Scottsdale Airpark."}
{"text":"YELP makes my out of town trips so much FUN.  This place Rocks!  Hidden in an industrial complex, there is no way you would find it without the help of YELP.  I was with my clients on a business trip and I was the designated \"find us a place to eat\" each day of our trip.  Someone suggested Italian food so I went to Yelp and found this gem of a place.  The service was terrific. Our server was so attentive.  First they bring some really tasty and tender bred with a delicious oil to dip it in. I am not sure how many our group ate, but they kept it coming.  I had the Gnocchi which was delicious.  One of my friends had Mamas Gravy and they said it was to die for.  Dinner was so great I figured dessert was going to be spectacular.  Without a doubt I had the best Tiramisu of all time.  It was so good you could not help but make groans of happiness as you ate it.   My friend had the New York Style Cheesecake and loved every bite.  Another had the Spumoni Ice cream and another the Triple Chocolate Cake.  All delicious.    If you are in the area and want terrific Italian Food you MUST go here."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 20 years.  The owners change.  The staff changes.  The menu remains pretty much the same.  What else does NOT change is the food -- consistently delicious!  Served quickly.  Friendly doesn't change either."}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrific! We finally found our \"Go To\" Italian spot. The first thing we noticed was the cozy atmosphere with great customer service. The owner greeted us as we came in and the both waitress's that helped us were great and very friendly. The food was great. The meatballs, lasagna, and bread were very good. They cook the bread fresh so you have to be a little patient, but it's well worth the wait. The meat in the meatballs and in the lasagna is probably some of the best I've ever had.   What I liked about it, is it wasn't a \"heavy\" feeling meal. It was really good and we got plenty full but I didn't feel terrible afterwards. I'm guessing it has something to do with how they cook it the real way. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the best Italian places I have ever had the pleasure of dining at.  I found out about it via Yelp, before going out to Scottsdale for Spring Training. My family and some friends were looking for a good restaurant, and based on the good reivews, I suggested this place.  Needless to say, we were not disappointed!  So, first of all, this place is off the beaten path (which I like)... not hard to find, but you have to look for it.  It's tucked in this neighborhood where you would not expect a restaurant, but the place is great!!!  Get reservations.... it's busy. We went on a Saturday night.  But the owner was there and was so friendly, accommodating, and helpful... he is the one who took our order, and took the time to answer all the questions we had.  It was a beautiful experience. They were so warm and hospitable, and the food was simply off the hook!! I mean, melt in your mouth good! We were there about 3 hours and closed the place down but never did they make us feel like we needed to get out of there... we were considerate of their time but they were also considerate of ours, never tried to rush us out or anything. I believe the owner's name is John... I'm so bad with names... but he was just an absolute doll and it was truly one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Delicioso!  Grazie Mille!!"}
{"text":"Follow Google Maps to this 'Hidden Gem' off of Thunderbird & 73rd and you will NOT be disappointed! First recommendation..CALL to make reservations before you go! Went there on a Saturday night without and they only had outdoor seating available..which was FINE because it was a gorgeous evening. The Owner/Host was warm and welcoming and we had a delightful/attentive waitress, Suzanna. Started with a glass of Pinot Grigio and it was smooth and delicious. Typically, I am NOT a 'fan' of Italian but I found an entree on the menu that knocked my socks off..the Sacchatti con 4 Formaggio! It was little pasta pouches filled with a creamy & sweet blend of cheeses in a Brown Butter Sauce and topped with fresh Parmesan. Ate EVERY delicious morsel and can't wait to return for more next time the 'urge' for Italian strikes!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, nice and calm environment. Best Italian restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Fantastic bruschetta ! So many great dishes to choose from and the staff is super friendly . Great to come with friends and family . I am from NJ so I am very picky about Italian and this passes the test."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food.  Fresh vegetables, perfectly al dente pasta, high quality cuts of meat, and very flavorful sauces.  We had the pappardelle, penne al vodka, and veal piccata.  Service was very attentive and also kid friendly.  Affordable and large portions.  Wine list is decent as well."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing food plus superb service- win win.  We ordered 2 things off the specials for the night. The calamari special was fantastic- so many flavors which complimented each other so well. I ordered a tenderloin stuffed with spinach and prosciutto and fontina cheese- so delicious. My husband ordered mamas gravy which is only on the Saturday menu- he enjoyed every bite.  Oh and the bread that comes out prior to the meal was soft, warm and pretty much melts in your mouth. Nice that they provide a dipping sauce too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional! We stopped here for lunch after reading some reviews and we were not disappointed. This place is off the beaten path, but worth the trip. Being from NY, finding good Italian food is not easy, but this place rises to the task. It makes sense since the owners are actual Italians from New York. We had the eggplant parmigiana sub which was superb. We also shared the chicken focaccia sandwich which was outstanding. We plan on trying the pizza next time which we were assured was legit. You must try this place if you are looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and ordered the baked ziti. The food was all freshly made and delicious. The bread and dip was good too! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just changing ownership and we had the opportunity to meet Susan, the new owner. You can tell there are a number of regulars that eat there often. Service is very attentive and personable. I felt that the price are reasonable too, and good portions. There bread is as good as the reviews say it is!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for posting \"Lotsa Pasta\" on local Yelp. I wasn't craving pasta until I saw this on my activity feed. Ohhh, pasta.... I saw that this restaurant was close to my hubby's work so perfect, he can pick us up an order on his way home.   I ordered the gnocchi and he ordered some type of pizza. When he got home, his pizza was a little cold so we had to put the pizza in the toaster oven for a little bit. The gnocchi alla senese had sausage and ham with a brandy cream sauce. It had tons of flavor. I wished they added more gnocchi though, less ham and sausage because it was a little salty. The gnocchi also came with garlic bread which I thought was ok.   Our bill was a little over $30. I think I would have had a better experience if I dined at the restaurant instead of ordering to go."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great homemade food. Enjoyed the authentic Italian ambiance and wine list. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been hidden away here for years  It is at th end of the scottsdale airport runway. It's a down to earth new york family run restaurant serving basic italian fare such as macRoni  and gravy ,  lasagna and pizzas . The food is very good there is indoor and patio dining. Beer and wine is served  and there is a good wine selection. Come here for plane jane italian food. There is plenty of  parking available."}
{"text":"Amazing food we had a great time here. I have eaten plenty authentic Italian in NYC I am from there so I am a good judge. This is truly delicious and authentic. We loved everything we ordered. I had the Cesar salad & manicotti my hubby had house salad & baked ziti... customer service was excellent. Down falls : no military discount, my soup not so yummy, and forks weren't clean had to send it back but they took care of it ASAP. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona for 20 years and I was born and raised in New York so when it comes to pizza, I have a pretty good idea what to look for in a good pie.  Ok first let's look at the crust, New Yorkers fold pizza and when you fold a slice of pizza the crust should crack similar to a taco shell and that is what you get here in this place. The second thing is the sauce, this sauce has a sweet flavorful taste that goes so perfectly with the crust and of course the cheese. The cheese is excellent. It is the absolute best pizza I ever had in Arizona and don't gimme that gormet stuff. Gimme a slice on a paper plate and we're done!"}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Scottsdale--Portions, taste, atmosphere, Vince, Vi and Michael, are great--what a pleasurable evening ----we took 20 people there and thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  Thanks for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Kind of hidden away so it can be really quiet. Filled up when we were there tho and had great food. The specials were creative and delicious...bacon wrapped dates with balsamic reduction? I think yes! Perfect for a date or the family, you definitely gotta try it. The owner and his employees are kind and chatty"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Lady taking orders ignored us completely, talking to her friend about her kids. Had to actually interrupt them and ask to put in my order. Calamari was soggy and chewy.... disgusting. It took 40 minutes to get my pizza, had to go ask about its status and it was just sitting there ready to go but no one had delivered it to our table. Good pizza, nasty calamari, horrific service. Don't go during lunch time."}
{"text":"we are from Ny so seeing this place we had to go. I love trying penne alla vodka out of state. I wasn't a fan though. I was expecting mind blowing! there is always that chance of being disappointed on alla vodka out of state just wish it hadn't been here. my husband loved his lasagna though and said it was just perfect. if I wasn't getting over being sick I would have loved to try the fresh mozzarella or something else on the menu. I was sticking to basics, those four cheese pouches on the menu seemed like they would have been a great idea if I hadn't been sick! maybe next trip....this was our last meal and it was a good one though.   plus it was great being seated without a reservation especially after going to the grand canyon and driving all day, plus we were all flying out that night..."}
{"text":"I like this place. Authentic Italian cuisine with a family owned attitude. The freshly baked bread is wonderful and the marinara sauce tastes homemade. Get away from the tourist restaurants and dine with the locals. You can even dine outside and watch the Lear jets land at Scottsdale airport."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden, sitting at the south end of the runway at Scottsdale Airport.  The first time I stopped in they had just started a happy hour and the weather was beautiful so I sat out on the patio to have a glass of wine and some apps. The calamari was perfect, very light and tender.  The arancini rice balls with marinara sauce and the lobster ravioli were wonderful too.    I recently stopped in again and had their crab ravioli, pesto shrimp angel hair pasta and the tiramisu along with of course some wine.  Yummy!!! It was all fantastic once again...and Megan was great too!   I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful find! This little gem of a restaurant is nestled in behind the Scottsdale airport.   The bread they serve is homemade and fresh. Each table gets a round loaf of their own to dip in the olive oil/vinegar and herb mixture. Great way to start the meal.  The Caesar salad was fresh and delicious, and even the croutons are made in house.   Our main meal was mama's gravy and I believe it is only served on Saturday night. We got the last serving, and it was terrific. The sauce was hearty and flavorful  and the main ingredient was love! (Along with the meatball, sausage and pork and pasta).  The prices are very reasonable, as are the portions. This will definitely become one of our \"go to\" restaurants."}
{"text":"The light at the end of the tunnel has been turned back on and the old menu is back!  So glad to be able to enjoy all of our favorites again!  John is the best, and along with the food, one of the main reasons we come back so often."}
{"text":"Huge portions....don't let the industrial park vibe outside scare you. The staff is very friendly and food is totally solid, if not super inventive.  If you are looking for a good mix between fast-ish food and homemade cooking and don't mind looking like you are pulling up to a storage locker for a body dump, this is the place for you!  Chicken parm sandwich for the win."}
{"text":"Damn! This place totally rocked.   I was in AZ on business and needed a little Italian food to comfort me after 10 days on the road. NY's Best Italian Bistro was just the thing I needed.   The people working there were all smiles and took great care to make sure everything was perfect. The waitress described each special in a way that made me want to eat the air around her to capture the flavor of the words that she just bespoke.  The eggplant appetizer with a stuffing of ricotta cheese, spinach and basil was topped with a chunky, tart and mouth-exploding marinara sauce that made me utter \"oh my God\" in disbelief. It was amazing. And so simple.   Next up was the gluten-free penne with meatballs in a vodka sauce. Huge portion of taste that no mortal could finish. But it was a great snack the next day in my hotel room.   Wine list was good and I will definitely be back here next time I roll through Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We love NY Best Italian Bistro.  Family feel - not a chain - always good food.  We've never been disappointed with any of the food, service or drinks."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Italian food. It reminded me of my trip to Italy, plus exceptional service.  Went to this place for a friend's birthday, and they allowed us to stay an hour after closing.  Try it!"}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant are awesome! They're like your sweet aunt and uncle that make you amazing food. Lunch is delicious, and dinner is even better! The wait staff is passionate, and courteous! I recommend them to my customers all the time!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. I had a patient rave about the food here.  He lived part-time in Chicago and we were trading some of our local / Chicago favorite restaurants.  He mentioned New York's Best Italian Bistro and I thought it sounded like a deli.  He recommended I go check it out.  So I arranged date night with the SO (who turns down an opportunity for date night after all?) and went last Friday.  By far the BEST Italian food I hve ever had.  My boyfriend and I shared the Bruschetta as a starter.  Wonderful flavors (be prepared for garlic!) and was the perfect size for two. For dinner I chose the Gnocchi with Bolognese Sauce and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna. The Bolognese Sauce was OMG perfect and the Gnocchi tender and plentiful.  The lasagna came out bubbling hot, with just the perfect amount of sauce, and it almost had a sweet side to it, and both dishes were delicious.  The Tiramisu ........wow.....the fluffiness, the creaminess, the subtle hint of liquer....  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time, but wasn't disappointed with this visit.  John was super nice to us and, per my request, moved us to a table by a window.  Our waitress, Brecken, was great .. a little over worked which slowed down service, but she did a good job.  Our busser, Austin, was did a great job and was very pleasant. He seemed to be doing a lot of different jobs as well.  The food was out-standing. My chicken piccata was great  My girlfriend ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara which she enjoyed, however, there was a tad bit too much oil in the bottom of the bowl.  We ended with the chocolate layer cake which was baked to perfection .. nothing frozen here.  Oh, and of course, the bread and the oil it comes with .... very good.    The only knocks would be the service was a little slow due to possible understaffing issues and the restaurant itself was a tad bit warm inside.    We will be making this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We were attracted to this restaurant because of good reviews posted elsewhere.  So my wife and I went for lunch.  My wife really liked the Pizza Bianco, and we even had enough left over for dinner that night too!  I had a sandwich and got a side of fries.  Unfortunately, the fries looked like they'd been done in oil that hadn't been hot enough as they were a little soft/soggy.  Nonetheless, I ate them and they tasted just right.  We said we'd go back and try them for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"On a family vacation in Scottsdale, AZ, we stumbled across this quaint little Italian restaurant that was tucked away by the airport about a block off Scottsdale Road. The reviews were good, we were hungry and with a family full of ex-New Yorkers living in Southern California, we're always up for some good New York atmosphere.  As we pulled up and walked in, someone held the door open for us... turned out to be one of the owners (I believe)... I was immediately greeted (as the last one of the bunch walking in.. and hobbling on a banged up knee from a day of tubing through rapids).. with sarcasm on how I should \"take my time, they'll be open another 5 hours\"..  Ahh... New York sarcasm.  I was already feeling \"at home\".  We sat down fairly quickly.  The restaurant had a good amount of people in it, but still had room for us with barely a wait.  We never said anything about being \"from New York\" but were treated quite well from the wait staff (and owners/managers) who kept checking in to be sure everything was going well.   THE FOOD: The menu was typical Italian.  Amongst the 7 of us we had Linguini in White Clam sauce, Eggplant Parmagiana, Shrimp Parmagiana, Gnocchi, a small pizza, Cavatelli w/ sausage & broccoli and Calamari Fra Diavolo (ordered by my 8 year old son).  The one thing I wanted to get but passed on was the Braciole (in mama's gravy).  That was a special, but I opted for the Linguini instead.  EVERYTHING was really good.  We didn't stay for desert since we were all tired from the long day of tubing, so I can't comment on the deserts... but we were all quite happy with our meal.  Additional Service note: We found out towards the end of our meal that our waitress was from Massapequa, NY (a town on Long Island that my wife & I lived in w/ the kids before moving to Cali).  The other owner came over.. he was from the Bronx.  We all joked around a bit and they were certainly a friendly bunch.  I observed how friendly the staff was with other guests too and they certainly appeared to make everyone feel welcome.  Always a plus.  Good food + Good, friendly service from people who appear to honestly care is alway a winner in my book.  There's a Maggiano's down the road and a couple of \"NYPD\"'s, but I HIGHLY recommend this place for it's authenticity."}
{"text":"After lots of research for the beats Italian food, we made the trip from Surprise, AZ. John, from the Bronx, was the most amazing host. He made our anniversary so special! We had the specials: seafood salad (very fresh and tasty)and lobster ravioli(with the most decadent cream sauce). He suggested a chilled Red, which was a perfect addition to our meal, especially given the hot weather. We ended with tiramisu and cheesecake, yummmm. The fresh bread was awesome too. So good we bought a gift cert for the picky New York in laws :) thanks John!"}
{"text":"John is great. Lasagna was great. Made for a memorable evening.  A bit hard to find but worth it when you do."}
{"text":"Best.Bruschetta.Ever.  I came here with some co-workers for lunch and found quite a gem! I would have never found it on my own as it was tucked away, but thanks to Yelp I found it! Apparently one of my co-workers had been coming here for years but had kept the secret all to himself. The Mediterranean salad with chicken was very good, and the bruschetta was to die for! I liked the chewy bread instead of crusty, crispy kind.  The pizza bread was decent but could have been a bit saucier.  The decor is adorable. I am always so happy to find small places like this!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the lunch menu recently so we knew we needed to go back and try dinner. We started out with the calamari inferno, one of their signature appetizers which was very good. I had the veal marsala and hubby had veal parmigiana. Well worth the price because the veal portions were huge. I had three big patties, very tender, and the marsala sauce was delicious. Very friendly, attentative service. As we sat and ate many regulars came through the door. It's definitely a word of mouth kind of place, because one would never see it otherwise. It's off the main road, tucked away. I see us becoming a couple of regulars ourselves."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night and was disappointed!  I ordered the chicken Marsala and asked to have gluten free pasta or vegetables instead of the regular pasta. Our waiter looked bored and said he couldn't do that. No explanation. Told me I'd just have to have the chicken. They have gluten free pasta on the menu!  Upset and had only the chicken breadt to eat. My husbands cod was cold. We would not recommend it here. They have a cute outdoor patio - we asked to sit there but we're told we couldn't even though the tables were empty the entire time we were there.  We won't be back or recommend it to our friends. Portion size is perfect though"}
{"text":"We dined here for a birthday celebration.  The wait staff was excellent and they were very accommodating, I wish the seats were a little bigger and softer as I needed a pillow.  All the food was amazing, well prepared and came out in a timely fashion.. The waiter John is from the east coast and hit it off with my family members.  The antipasto was great as an app and everyone had fresh made pasta with one pizza.  the food melted in your mouth and even the bathrooms were clean.  It is right next to the Scottsdale airpark.  Great Food, Great Services, Great atmosphere and Great time .  Enjoy from one foodie to another"}
{"text":"Been here twice, and both times made me feel like I was going to my grandparent's house for dinner. I'm Sicilian and quite finicky when it comes to Italian food, but this place is the real deal.  It was nice to witness when people walked in the door, John the manager, would greet them by name. This shows me that there are a lot of regulars (repeat costomers) and he has taken the time to get to know his patrons.  Now on to the food...  The first visit, I ordered the chicken picata. It was some of the best I've ever tasted. The second time I had the chicken marsala. Again, it was very delicious. We also tried the fried mozzarella appetizer, which was placed on a bed of prosciutto and arrugala, and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Wow! For desert we had canoli and tiramisu. The canoli wasn't like my grandmother's but it was ok.  The only place almost as good as this place is Nicks, but that is a distant second."}
{"text":"Best place for Italian food! Friendliest waiter food was delicious ! Service impeccable !"}
{"text":"Went in here for a quick bite for dinner. Service was prompt and courteous. I had some eggplant parm and a salad. It was the best eggplant parm I have had at a Italian restaurant in quite a while."}
{"text":"Four stars for lunch.  Two for dinner.  The food's great across the board.  So is the service.  I just don't notice being in 70's era surroundings at the end of a municipal runway as much when chowing down on a $15 lunch cheesesteak and soda, the way I do when forking over $30 for a bowl of pasta and glass of wine."}
{"text":"Brought the kids to lunch here. They have cheese pizza for $2.99 a slice. I got the pasta special with fusilli, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and sausage. My hubby had the spaghetti with meat sauce. For dessert we had the spumoni which was coated in chocolate and delicious. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I found this little gem in the middle of nowhere. Thanks to all the Yelp reviews. Let me start off by saying that this place is in the middle of a business park. We went for dinner on a Saturday night so the business park was empty except a few cars in one corner of the parking lot. The restaurant is not facing the street so I just followed the parked cars.   All I have to say about this place is wow. The decor is casual. Nothing really pops out to me but the food is great.   My wife was going wild over the hot fresh bread. I had the thin crust Margherita pizza. Very good. I really enjoyed it. My wife had the spaghetti with meat sauce and really enjoyed it. We think that they used the same sauce for the pizza and spaghetti which we're not complaining cause it was so good.   We ended our meal with their homemade Spinoni that had three flavors of chocolate, pistachio and strawberry that was dipped in a hard chocolate. This was so good. We were fight over the last few bites and of course my wife won.   The service was great. They were filling our water cups in a timely manner without us asking. The server was very friendly, helped and very pleasant. They were very grateful that we came in and everyone thanks us.   What can I say great Italian food, good service but hidden in a business park. Can't wait to bring our kids."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food was delicious. My mom went to this 3 times in one week. She loved the spaghetti carbonara.  It's not very expensive, the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's NOT a quiet restaurant, we brought a 15 month old."}
{"text":"We order lunch from here for our office of 12. . . we also use their catering for luncheons with clients.  No matter what is ordered, we are NEVER disappointed.  The food is exceptional and the staff is great.  Definitely worth searching out if you've never been before!"}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten path of the main road but it was definitely a good find. The pricing wasn't too high and the staff is very friendly. Our waters were always full and several times someone came by to ask if we were okay.  My girlfriend got the vodka penne pasta which I tasted a couple times and it was delicious. Overall good atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Unexpected find hidden in a light industrial park near the Scottsdale Airport.  Family owned and run with great, simple fare.  Authentic, home-style Italian...nothing fancy or high-brow, but very good! Great spot for a satisfying lunch...be warned, though...there is not table service; you walk-up and place your order at a counter."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, upon my return this week, the food was not up to par. The pizza was a huge disappointment.  The toppings were very poorly distributed, to the point where some slices of pizza did not even have all the toppings on it. I personally found the crust terrible. They claim it's a thin crust pizza, but my whole table didn't agree with that description. Service is decent, but they are all up at the front talking about you and not even hiding the fact. They are looking right at you and commenting to each other back and forth. Talk about uncomfortable.  The icing on the cake tho, was when the owner came by to ask us if everything was okay. I hate having that conversation, but I said coyly, no, not really, not our best night and he replied, and I quote, \"great, that's just beautiful, beautiful!\" and walked away. That was it. Never heard from anyone again. Paid the bill and we left for one last time. I'll never go back after that. The service and food would not have received only 1 star, but since the owner acted that way and did not even care to know what was wrong, let alone do something about it, they get 1 star from me, and that's only because there is no lower rating."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my son. It's order and sit for lunch. And they will bring the food out to your table.  I had lasagna and my son had spaghetti with marinara plus we share a Caesar salad. Everything are fresh and the portion is good for us. Lasagna seemed to be a very popular as people around me were all having it. I like most is the food was not loaded with salt and I could taste every ingredients. My son is a picky eater and he liked his spaghetti here. Will definitely return with hubby for dinner and try out more of the other dishes and deserts too!"}
{"text":"Great food! Pastas are incredible - everyone in our party gave it 5 stars. The desert is also great. Servers are real, and I really enjoyed this Italian nook."}
{"text":"As advertised.  I have worked in the scot airpark area for over 20 years.  Finally stopped in and am glad I did."}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutely delicious and one of my new favorite spots now! We also had a really good pasta dish but the pizza is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Need a reservation for dinner--We had dinner on a Sat night, we arrived at 5:20pm. We have a little one, don't judge. :-) Anyway, they did get us seated but they were concerned because we did not have a reservation. I thought it was pretty early for them to be too busy and there was only 2 other tables taken at the time. They did begin to quickly fill up. I went ahead and gave 5 stars though because the food was really good and service was also once we were seated. Try the bruschetta, which is warm soft bread and melted cheese drizzled with balsamic-not the typical definition of bruschetta but really tasty. The pasta dishes are generous portions with really good marinara sauce. Pizza with good crust. We will be back with a reservation next time."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! We tried this place last night for the first time and we really enjoyed it. It's tucked away in the air park so use your GPS. The staff was great and food was INCREDIBLE. It has a charming and quaint ambiance to it. Makes a great date night. We will certainly be regulars."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Slightly hidden location a block off of Scottsdale but worth finding.  Only disappointment was that we didn't get to try Mama's Gravy.  Got there at 7 and they were already sold out.  Server and hostess and owners were all great and very attentive.  Reservations recommended. Great for anything from a casual dinner to a romantic dinner date."}
{"text":"Went last night my family. We have been there twice before a while back, I guess it is under new ownership. It was an awkward experience to say the least. They refused basic requests because they are trying to basically cut food costs. I heard the new owner tell the table next to us they couldn't substitute angel hair for linguini as their side pasta because they are trying to \"streamline\" the kitchen and staff. They had a couple basic requests as well that she refused and said to them \"restaurants who do that shut down and I don't want to shut down\". It was awkward to watch. A few mistakes from the server who was otherwise nice were also handled quite awkwardly. I just think the place used to be good but is having a hard time with chemistry and a new cheap owner. Place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Great classic Italian food. I usually get either the gnocchi or cavatelli with rosa sauce and always leave with a smile on my face. They also have great slices of pizza at lunch."}
{"text":"First time I've ever ordered from this place.  Had it delivered by Grub Hub.  Either the driver got hungry on the way, or they really stiffed me on the meal.  11$ for barely any spaghetti.  If I'm spending that much money, I at least expect more food.  Here's an image of what I received. http://i.imgur.com/q6VklWn.jpg  Also garlic bread was a bit disappointing, but not a big deal.  Spaghetti wasn't bad. Not amazing, but it was good.  Update: While I haven't tried them again as of yet (I will), they did contact me and let me know that the delivery driver had spilled my food and apologized for the inconvenience.  They also refunded my order for the issue.  I'm very grateful for that.  I'll try their food again soon."}
{"text":"Amazing bread & oil that came out after being seated, yum.  Otherwise - nothing special about this place from my perspective all around.  Bruchetta was decent.  The chicken parmesan was the thinnest piece of breaded chicken I've ever had from a restaurant - a little rough and I wasn't a fan of the sauce.   We traded a 1/4 of our meals.  I'm a lasagna man, and man this was not for me.  Food had a slight petting zoo/goat aroma that I didn't care for.  I was disappointed based on its 4.5 rating that brought me in.   Lastly I mention this only because it's a first - the waiter took a phone call while taking our order (honestly I didn't care but some guests would have gone loco over that I'm sure!).  Note: the patio seats have a ledge on them that may not be very comfortable for someone that's a little taller than average."}
{"text":"We met another couple here, our first time  dining at NY's Best Italian Bistro and we were not disappointed.  We decided to sit outside since it was such a nice evening.  A few planes took off while we were there, which enhanced the ambience for us.  We Started with a small Caesar salad that was quite generous and delicious, followed by Calamari Fritti, Deb had Manicotti, our friends had Spaghetti.  All delicious. So NYBIB is a winner on three fronts, fun location, great service and delicious food; we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The wife and I found this little tucked away spot on a Saturday evening. The service was just a little slow, but the staff took great care of us and the food was absolutely off the charts. People who know their Italian food frequent this place. We will certainly be going back. My comment about the service is probably an indicator that I'm always in a hurry. Our waiter treated us like family. If you are looking for some amazing Italian, this is the place."}
{"text":"Important - This restaurant has been bought by another local chain.  Times Square is the new owner. The phone number works for the new business.  The previous owner is not running this place.  I haven't been but they were nice."}
{"text":"What a find!!  I took my family to this place and everyone loved it.  The young teenager and a couple of adults, each with very different taste concerns.  All of us were very happy with the meal.    As a family we all poked around in each other's plates and we were all very pleased with all of it.  The young one had a pizza that everyone at the table loved.  One of us had the squash ravioli and that was probably the biggest hit of the night.  I am not usually a fan of oddly stuffed ravioli so I did not order it, but certainly would next time.  That was an amazing meal.    The deserts are also made on the premises from scratch.    The price for this meal was very reasonable.  Four of us ate for about $100 and we had deserts, coffee, beverages and sides.   This place is adjacent to the Scottsdale airport.  Off the beaten path.  Must try."}
{"text":"Most reviews refer to this as being tucked away...which it is.  The end of a runway.  With spectacular cuisine.  This rivals any Little Italy that you might find:  New York, the North End in Boston, Philly...  Try...everything.  Truly old world food that was spun in the kitchen of Italian masters.  The red sauces are light and fresh, the white sauces are a delight.  Pizza -- magnifico.  Strombolis -- like you are sitting on a bench in Venice.  Pasta -- imagine the hills of Tuscany falling away at your feet and the sun setting on the horizon.    Really, a wonderful find in the elbow of Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We recently had dinner here and as usual it rocks!  I had the veal parm and it was delicious and tender. The sauce is not sweet rather savory as I prefer.  My husband had the beef braciole.  He was not as impressed with the dish. We have had many of their specials in the past to include the pork Osso Buco and the stuffed Dover Sole.  Amazing!  The wine selection is good too.  It is however a bit pricey.  Most dishes average $20-$35."}
{"text":"I have worked nearby in the airpark for years now and have always wondered about this place. Finally one night while I was craving Italian food my husband remembered \"that place we always pass by in the airpark\" so I yelped it, saw the great reviews, and so we went.   We arrived a little before 6:00 on a Saturday night. The hostess greeted us and asked if we had reservations with a \"I hope you have reservations\" look (the place wasn't packed yet but it got to be quickly). We told her we didn't have reservations and she politely asked if we would be okay with the patio - this was not a problem. I would eat on the floor if they wanted me to - their food was amazing!  We started with homemade bread and the most delicious dipping oil EVER. We also had the Calamari Inferno, which was to DIE FOR. I had the Saturday Special, \"Mama's Gravy\" (it involved pork tenderloin wrapped around meatballs with rigatoni and authentic Italian sausage) and my husband had Eggplant Parmesan. I cannot put into words how delicious this place is, just GO. You won't regret it.   Prices were low, servings were generous, service was great (turns out the hostess was also our waitress and I think she was an owner / family as well), and the food can't be beat.   Its probably a good thing I didn't go to the restaurant during all these years of passing by it on my way home from work because I would be a total addict. Who am I kidding though - I will probably start getting takeout from here on my way home regularly :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great people!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! No frills here and great tasting dinner items. I ordered a pear and cheese pasta dish with balsamic drizzle.  AMAZING. The other dishes we ordered were fantastic.  Simple and very tasteful with affordable prices.  Will come back."}
{"text":"One of best Italian food I had in a long time. The first thing I noticed was the cleanliness of restaurant and Andrea Bocelli songs playing. Everything we ordered was excellent. This will be my go to Italian food. Our waiter was awesome too."}
{"text":"Started with the fried calamari, asked for the spicy marinara on the side. The sauce was absolutely delicious!! One of the best sauces out there, even better than the Italian restaurants in NYC.  Ended up ordering the Pescatore Pasta made Fra Diavlo style per my request. This dish was to die for. Sauce was spot on, seafood was perfectly cooked. Mussels, clams and shrimp. Yum! My only suggestion would be to remove the tail on the shrimp. I really dislike seeing the tail left on when it's in a pasta dish and everything is all mixed together.   Ended our meal with their cheesecake and cannoli.. Both were also amazing. Our server was on point. A little slow at greeting us but definitely redeemed himself with his top notch service.  I highly recommend this restaurant. If you are looking for delicious, authentic Italian cuisine - then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 0 stars but I had to mark something. We actually never did eat here but after walking in noticed the place didn't look very clean. Then we were given menus that were sticky.  We ordered sparkling water and I noticed that the glass they gave my husband was very smeared with fingerprints. So we told the waitress who inspected the glass as if we were lying, she then walked off with it. She returned with what we thought was a new glass. My husband went to take a drink from the glass and noted a bad smell so he asked the waitress again for another glass.  At that point a waiter also came to the table to check what was happening. The waitress told the waiter \"I wiped the glass out with the blue rag\". As if it should not be a problem At that point we said we were leaving and offered to pay for the water. Although they didn't accept money for the water the waiter did say \"Sorry we weren't up to your expectations\". We will never return."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and we've also had take out a few different nights. The quality of the food and the service just keeps being amazing. It almost feels too good to be true- like something will give at some point...but it never does.   Each time we eat there, we like to hit the patio to watch the planes, otherwise you definitely need a reservation. The flavors, the quality of the ingredients and the creativity of the dishes make this place shine. Try it all- it's all good. And if there are still specials available that evening, order them! If they bottled their marinara, I'd buy it.   I used to think I wasn't that into Italian food and then I ate here and realized I'd just been settling for poor quality/cheesy/greasy grossness that was labeled Italian. Eat here; it will change your definition of good Italian food."}
{"text":"Really looking forward to eating here as the reviews and some friends said it was great.  Perhaps we went on a bad day, but it took almost an hour for our main meal to come out after we ordered it.  Way too long.  Our food was not cold, but not as warm as I would like.  Perhaps the waiter was not too attentive to bringing our meal when the kitchen had it ready.  Our waiter rarely visited our table and we had to ask another server for help occasionally.  The don't have a lot of wine by the glass, just by the bottle so I was disappointed in their selections.  I ordered the seafood carbonara, and while it tasted excellent, there was a total of 3 shrimp and two scallops.  Not a lot for almost $23.00.  I was quite disappointed.  Atmosphere was not terrible.  About what I would have expected.  Will I be back?  I don't know.  I might give them another chance but I wanted to report on my first experience there.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed dinner at NY's Best Italian Bistro this weekend. It's a cute little place tucked away on 73rd street with plenty of parking which is a plus in my book.   By Scottsdale standards, it's not a \"fancy\" or \"upscale\" restaurant per se, but it can't be considered a dive either. It's moderately nice from a décor perspective.  My date and I were seated toward the door and my biggest complaint would be that the table was very, very small and cramped. I had to put my purse under the table on the floor.  I asked for bread and they brought us a huge serving of warm, soft, delicious Italian bread. Very yeast-y (not sure that's a real word but let's go with it) tasting and fresh- came with olive oil for dipping. Really enjoyable!  I had an absolutely stellar glass of moscato too!  My date ordered the shrimp scampi and was pleased with the taste and the fact that it was a huge serving of food. I didn't sample it, but the shrimp were big & juicy and it looked awesome.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was hands down the best I've ever had. It was cooked & seasoned well and there was a generous helping of melted mozzarella cheese atop the eggplant. The best way to my heart is to not be skimpy with the cheese- yay! The serving of spaghetti that came with the eggplant wasn't as al-dente as I usually prefer, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  We were too stuffed to order dessert but they do have cannoli on the menu (a personal fave of mine) and I *will* be back to try it!"}
{"text":"Joint is off the hook!!  We ended up finding this place on yelp actually and by far the best spot we found in AZ while on vacation.  It's definitely tucked away in an industrial business area but what a gem!!  It's family run with the majority of the employees from NY.  Has a warm Soprano type of feel inside but totally inviting!!  Delicious food, great hospitality and for a great price.  Just thinking about the calamari is making me salivate as we speak... We had soup, pasta, salad and the focaccia bread is outstanding.  And can I just say homemade cannolis??  OMG...FABULOUS!!  We ate here at least twice in 1 week and it hit the spot each time.  I wish they had a bay area location..This place is a must when in AZ."}
{"text":"Well I'm sure everyone knows it's time to update my review since the original chef is back along with all the favorites. I was there in early May and it's back on track. Not that things were that bad but I think people have a level of expectation and that's where the loyalty comes in. That being said, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this fabulous place again--it remains a little known gem and the one place my friends and family request to go when they are all in town."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely return. If you like warm familia atmosphere, delicious light Italian food (I noted more hearty options too), and a casual clientele/neighborhood restaurant feel, you may love this place as we did. Reminiscent of Italian places I grew up with in Northern  Indiana. Specifically,  the pasta is fresh, the sauce is slow simmered, and the menu offers several options. The complementary bread is light and fresh and worth the visit. Located adjacent to the Scottsdale airport. All in all, it's  a winner if you relate to what I've written  so far."}
{"text":"This is a sad day.  I have eaten my last meal at New York's Best Italian. This has been my go to place for years and it WAS an outstanding restaurant.  The New owner, new chief, new menu have destroyed an iconic restaurant.  I will not be back!"}
