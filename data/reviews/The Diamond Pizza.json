{"text":"Pittsburgh has a lot of good Pizza places, Campitti's, Fiori's, Mineo's, Aielo's, Beto's, Vincents when it was good. But the Diamond at PNC park has my vote for the dark horse in Pittsburgh's pizza race.   While expecting an eatery at PNC of park to be good let alone really good is surprising, because you don't go to Fenway just for the franks, but the Diamond is making me rethink that philosophy. I might come to PNC just for the Pizza at the Diamond. It's that good.   The three meat or sicilian, which is bacon, pepperoni, and sausage is awesome. I wanted to heist the whole pizza and plow through it by myself in the corner. It was that good.   Check it out jags -"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here during a Pirates game on 9/11. I was given tickets to the game with $10 stored on each. We go to this place first to get beers with the $10 loaded on our tickets. We were purposely skipped while at the bar. Once Amy did get to us we ordered two beers one for each ticket. She says 'oh I spilled beer on my scanner so I have to scan your ticket on the other end of the bar. She scans, comes back and says we owe $7. Both beers together should have been $16, our tickets had enough to cover this until Amy got ahold of them.   So we contested what she was saying and asked to speak to the supervisor. Guess what the supervisor did...scanned the tickets on the register Amy claimed was broken. Amy then VERY RUDELY threw her hands up gasped in frustration and stormed away. So she lied about the scanner and she added a pizza charge to our ticket!!  We were forced to walk clear across the stadium to guest relations who told us about the pizza charge then called an Aramark person who ended up handing us both a ten dollar bill.  This was confusing and being skipped over at first and then overcharged I'm sure was done on purpose. I was one of twenty people I work with with the same tickets with the $10. Why were the two of us the only ones with a problem? It is scandalous maybe slightly criminal and racist. Why did she lie about the scanner why was a pizza charged why were we made to walk clear across the stadium only to have ARAMARK be called. I'm disgusted by this place. They almost ruined what was a wonderful evening at the park."}
{"text":"Just to the left of Atria's on the Roberto Clemente Bridge side of PNC Park is where you'll find The Diamond Pizza.   Not only do they have really good pizza, the cheese is especially good, but you can enter the park there as well. Never a line.  Friendly ticket taker and bag search person greet you at the door, scan your ticket and provide a program along with any promotional items for the game.  Once inside, order by the slice, grab a beer if that's your pleasure and watch the game on either of the TVs before going to your seats. Another bonus, restrooms are just outside the restaurant as you enter the left field corridor.   Like most pizza/sandwich shops, this one can be hopping. No frills in the service, mustard working folks trying to make good food for the money. And they do."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch, I ordered a whole Italian hoagie and a coke. The total was less than $10. The sub was good, plenty of meat and toppings. They let you put on your own Italian dressing, which is good because some places think the flavor needs to come from the dressing and not the meats. I disagree, I don't want them swimming in the sauce! It was toasted and still soft enough to where I didn't cut up the roof of my mouth. I will definitely be back and try out their pizza because it looked great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met here for lunch last week.  It was a great spot to grab a quick bite and enjoy each other's company.  We work on opposite sides of the river so this location is a good semi half way meeting point.  Overall, not bad, but not great either.  For around $9, you get two slices of pizza and a beverage.  The price seemed a bit steep to me, especially considering there are plenty of cheaper options around.  I suppose when you factor in that people going to a game can get the pizza, the prices make a little more sense.  That being said, you do pay for speed and convenience.  The cheese and pepperoni pizza was tasty and the pepperoni was a little crisp just the way I like them.  The meat lovers left something to be desired.  It reminded me of the pizza you used to get in the school cafeteria that wasn't quite cooked all the way through.  The cheese wasn't quite all melted/blended and the dough still seemed a little raw.  This is not a slice I'd try again.  In addition to the pizza options, they have various sandwiches and a daily special.  I'll probably try one of the sandwiches or a special on a future visit.  Overall, a decent place for a quick lunch on the north side."}
