{"text":"Great fish and chips. Nice folks"}
{"text":"Sadly, my last visit... I've been to St. Andrew's several times over the years and the food has always been consistent in taste, but unfortunately, a recent visit will be my last.  My experience is that It seems to be a place for regulars, especially seniors, to go for lunch or supper. Each time I have been in, either to dine-in or take out, the majority of people I've seen have fit that bill. It's kind of nice to have that type of establishment in neighborhoods, where people walk in and are likely to see people they know. We need more of those places. It's always puzzling to me though, that people who seem to dislike serving others, work in the \"service\" industry. Some, not all, of the waitresses have always seemed impatient and not overly friendly, actually, not genuinely friendly at all. They seem just tolerant of customers. I really would have eaten there more often if that had not been the case, because I like the small homey feel of the place.  I had noticed that the last few times I was in, the portion size of the fish was declining, but I understand that fish is no longer as abundant, so I chalked it up to that and higher overhead etc. Yesterday I went in for take-out supper and ordered haddock and chips for $11. It came in a 4x5x1 3/4 box that was filled with fries and the fish was on top. The fries are English-style, chunky and cooked nicely. There were actually more than I could eat. The fish was the disappointment. It was the smallest portion that I have ever had from any f&c restaurant. I cut it and there were literally four bites of fish. Had I received that plate in the restaurant, I would have asked to see the manager, as I think it was a rip-off.  I spoke with a friend that lives nearby and told him my experience, as I know he tries every f&c place he can find. He actually said that he had a disagreement with them about the portion size the last time he was there and he no longer goes.  If you read this, St. Andrew's, your customers are the reason that you are in business, so maybe you could demonstrate your gratitude by being more gracious instead of making people feel that YOU'RE doing THEM a favour by serving food. Also, while your prices are in line with other fish and chip restaurants, your portions are not. People notice. Otherwise, maybe you should change your name to St. Andrew's Chips & Fish!"}
{"text":"We came here for Good Friday for fish and chips.  My bf selected the halibut and chips and I  changed my mind and decided to order the steak and onion pie. The steak and onion pie was not that great...completely my fault as I probably was the only person in the packed restaurant who DIDN'T order fish and chips.  The steak pie was slightly soggy, small and not enough meat in the filling. The chips were cut thickly, blanched and tasted quite delicious.   My bf's halibut however, was to die for! We shared the dish and the helping of fish was generous, with crispy batter, and tender and moist inside. Yummy!  I've had fish and chips in Brighton and London, UK and the fish and chips in St Andrews is the best I've had. We initially didn't like that the tartar sauce was pre-packaged but it went well with the fish regardless.  Atmosphere is kinda old-fashioned, with carpets on the floor, and with an unprepossessing appearance in a sketchy strip mall. However, behind the sketchy appearance is a really awesome restaurant with great fish and chips.   PS Don't order the peas as a side. They don't tell you that's it mushy."}
{"text":"Love the fish and chips and as well as the meat pies from this place! Wish they made their own tartar sauce though."}
{"text":"Got an order of halibut and chips for take out a couple of months ago! My boyfriend loves the fries (nice and thick) but I personally didn't enjoy it that much, I found them too soft/soggy for my liking. The fish was really juicy and the batter was crunchy, but overall I found both the fries and fish a bit oily. The portion (especially the fries) was also on the smaller side compared to what I expected for the price we paid. It wasn't awful but the next time I'm craving fish & chips I'll be trying out different restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is alright.   It's hard to go wrong with deep fried food, and st Andrews doesn't go wrong, but it's just that -- deep fried food. I got the fried shrimp and it is literally got and fresh, but there is no seasoning or additional flavor. The fries are beefy and hot, but again so seasoning or anything special (they actually could really use some salt).   The restaurant is no frills at all.   I would have expected lower prices given quality & atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! It is the best fish and chips I've had. I was going to give it 4 stars because the place is a little dated and still looks the same as it did 20 years ago but I figured the food is what I'm rating! This is the best place to get fish and chips, mushy peas, coleslaw, the works! And I don't have a sweet tooth but their fried oreos and mars bars are pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you! You don't actually go here for the fish and chips. You go here for disgusting (in the best possible meaning of the word) battered and deep fried delicacies that are hard to find this good outside the food trucks at The EX (minus the endless lineup). The batter they use here on all of these items is the real selling point: light, golden, crispy, and delicious. Deep fried jam sandwiches covered in custard (my favourite) are like a giant version of the toaster strudel. A crispy hot battered sandwich filled with sweet tart jam and covered with creamy delicious custard. I'm literally drooling a little as I type this... Deep fried oreos with ice cream, deep fried mars bars...it's kind of hard to go wrong. And, yeah, the fish and chips ARE pretty satisfying too. Don't expect anything special in terms of the actual restaurant: it's in a strip mall, the restaurant itself is fairly spartan, and the service isn't always great. Still, go there for the food."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips places still in existence.  The closing of Penrose Fish and Chips was a real heartbreaker, I'll never forgive the family for not selling it to a caring custodian, rather than just shutting it down altogether!  With the demise of Penrose, the authentic old school fish and chip shop is definitely under threat.  One of the very best that still remain is Saint Andrews, they are still doing it traditional style, and I especially like the haddock, the Alaskan White Fish is a better choice than the halibut which is pricey, and is always a rather dry piece of fish, in my opinion, no matter where you get it.  I also quite enjoy ordering the fish sandwich here, which is a big hunk of haddock on two slices of Scottish bread, rather than the typical hamburger bun. If you've never have Scottish bread, you owe yourself to try it, it's quite dense and cakey, and those who like it like it a lot.  Decor that's very basic, and probably hasn't been renovated since the 70s, and the food is similarly old-school and exactly what you'd expect from a Scottish fish and chip shop, including the deep fried battered Mars Bars, Oreos, and jam sandwich, all of which are ridiculously over-the-top and worth trying at least once.  Basic spot, good food, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've been dreaming of having fish and chips for days now so the day finally arrived.  This is my go to place near the Scarborough Town Centre located in a strip mall; only a 10 minute walk.  Well, Thursday is all-you-can-eat White Fish and fresh cut chips for only $11.95 which is a real deal.  Most fish places give you a small piece of fish and load on the potatoes for a ransom price...mind you it's white fish but I love food deals!  You're asked how many fish pieces you want to start with...2 for me.  After that, I might ask for 1 more piece which was the case tonight.  The fish batter is very light \"so it doesn't overpower the meat.\"  Service was great and only a few people were dining at the time.    My work friends and I come here about once a month during lunch time for their $8.95 specials.  Same great food and service.  I love to support small business owners and this place has been around for decades.  This place is also part of the www.VacinityRewards.ca loyalty program."}
{"text":"Their fish and chips are the closest I've tasted to the real deal in the UK. I wish I could eat here everyday, but I try not to go too often to keep up some semblance of a balanced diet.   The prices are good. The hours are limited on certain days, so check before you go. I always get take out, so I'm not sure what the service is like.  You can also get all kinds of deep fried goodness year-round that you don't usually find outside of the Ex and ribfests throughout the summer.  If you love fish and chips, you've got to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for fish, we have even done takeout more than once (gravy does not travel well lol) but the fish is always good, and St. Andrew's makes top notch fries. I like the meat pies that they bring in from the Scottish place in the same mall, they reheat them well. Make sure you order the potatoes they have as an appetizer, they are much bigger than regular fries, and of so delicious."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. On one hand, they have the best halibut and chips - the BEST! On the other hand, their dine-in service is abysmal. I'd rate the halibut and chips as 5 stars, while the service is only 2, rounded up to a 4 overall because take-out solves the problem.   The halibut is absolutely delicious. The batter is very crispy and the fish is tender and not at all fishy tasting. The fries are also delicious. They're thick and tasty and always served hot. The portion size is fairly consistent, except for the last time that I dined in when I got the smallest serving I've ever received from this place. The fish was pretty much half its usual size. I was with friends and I was really hungry, so I didn't bother complaining because I didn't want to make everyone else wait while my food was remade. That was only time I've ever received a small serving, so rest assured that that was an exception, not the rule.  Now the service...  I usually order for pick-up by calling, and picking up the food has always been fast enough and they are generous with the packets of tartar sauce and ketchup. Only once have I had a problem where the girl gave me grilled salmon instead of battered halibut...how does that even happen??? I just took it because they were about to close (look up their hours before you go, I always seem to go when they're closed) and I like salmon anyway.   I have never been impressed by the the times that I have dined in. The waitresses that have served me have never been particularly friendly or attentive. I almost always need to ask for more water because they just never check up on the tables after bringing out the food. The last time I dined in, three waitresses just sat together at another table playing with their phones until I called them over to get more water. Nice. Saved me a few bucks on tip.  The washrooms are in the basement. They're clean enough, nothing special. The whole restaurant really needs to be renovated, it just looks really dated. I know their typical patron is on the mature end of the scale, but it would probably help with attracting new business.   I hope this place stays open forever! Fix the service, fix the appearance, but DON'T CHANGE THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Thank you very much Phil M. for reviewing this place so I can give Haggis a try without going overseas.  What you're missing out on is the new Menu item, Deep Fried Oreos with 2 scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream.  From the selection of a few St. Andrews Lunch Specials($6.45), I chose Haggis & Chips.  It was a bit on the small portion but I'm not sure what the Market Value of the Modern Haggis is actually.  For that price, it's actually very acceptable for someone new to this specialty item to get a taste of Scottish/British Cuisine.  For those not doing a taste test, it's a bit small so you'll have to go with the regular A La Carte or Dinner size.  This place as it is named is set in British setting with wooden furniture and photos of St. Andrews Golf Course along with Golf Clubs on the top walls.  Back to the Modern Haggis, it is not what a rookie Haggis eater would envision as similar to how Sausages used to be in Intestine casing but now in artificial casing, so is the new style Haggis.  My Haggis came deep-fried and inside was finely chopped pieces of various Sheep internal goodness.  It's sheep because my friend knows that flavour anywhere and not for her.  It was strongly flavoured with Black Pepper and from my little knowledge it tasted similar to fillings in Meat Pies obviously the difference is the ingredients.  Treat it like a Deep-Fried Haggis Sausage with A-OK Fries.  The Deep Fried Oreos($4.25) was done in a similar Batter as the Fish so it has a slight savoury flavour to it but I enjoy it as it tasted like a soft Chocolate Cake batter inside the Fried Batter.  Everything goes well with Vanilla Ice Cream.  Btw, they have Deep Fried Mars Bar as well."}
{"text":"Simple place, great food, big portions and cheap prices.  Definitely a must for anyone that is Scottish, that is the cultural theme of this place.  The menu reflects this as well with things like deep fried jam sandwiches and haggis.  When you're done, check out a Scottish deli only two doors down in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to this place, whether they 're under new management or what, but the quality of the fish and crips has gone way downhill.  Our order last night had less fish than before, and was greasy and mushy, hard to cut, with absolutely no crispness to the batter.  The French fries were almost inedible.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Had the halibut and chips. Chips were good, fish was great. The batter wasn't too heavy, adhered well to the fish and stayed crispy even 20 minutes after purchase. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Tried their haddock and chips.  The chips were really good, nice portions, but for some reason, the batter on our fish was soggy.  It wasn't busy when we arrived so I'm not sure if this was just a one time occurrence. They stopped their coupon promotions which we used to get via email.  I'll have to go back and try it one more time."}
{"text":"This is a Scarborough staple.  They do fish and chips U.K. style and it's da bomb.  Yes you can get coleslaw but for U.K. Traditionalists, you can get mushy peas on the menu too. We have the cod and chips, which for us is more traditional UK fish and chips but they have Haddock and halibut and lots of other options. You can even order 1/2 chips if you don't like a lot of french fries. The meal also comes with a nice slice of bread and butter which for those of us who must have a chip butty .... heaven!  Quick and friendly service, and a takeout window for those who want to take away.  And for those of us that want to finish off with something that you typically can only get in Scotland, look for that deep-fried Mars bar or deep-fried jam sandwich with yellow peril. That's custard for those of you that live on this side of the pond.  ;)  Dinners come with coffee or tea.  Beer and wine is on offer."}
{"text":"This is the worst Fish and Chips I have EVER had. Stay away from this place. Words that best describe are dry, oily, poor quality fish. This is where people with no taste buds eat! If you want really good fish and chips try   Old York in Leaside. I recommend the owners try Old York and learn how good Fish and Chips are made."}
{"text":"Always see this place but never went in....Ordered by uber eats....it was good and will go back for more :). Prices are reasonable and service was good."}
{"text":"Traditional UK style fish and chips.  This is a Scarborough staple for for decades. Consistently good. Very good meat pies haggis, fritters, mushy peas,Scottish bread. Irn Bru. Sticky toffee pudding or a deep fried Mars bars are always delicious."}
{"text":"One of the better F&C places in town. Great batter and fresh oil. Good lunch meal deals, but lots of quirks: the lunch meal comes with tea or coffee (with fish and chips?!) and to get a can of pop is another $1. How is it $1 more expensive for the place to hand you a can vs  steeping tea or brewing coffee?! It's nonsensical. Want to upgrade the fish - no can do. In short, don't come in with any special requests, as even basic ones will get you a \"no\".   But I wouldn't bother upgrading the fish type anyway: I paid a big premium for halibut (not the lunch deal), and wish I'd stuck with whatever comes in the deal, because I tried a piece and it was just fine: tender and a HUGE portion. The halibut (which I had to post a picture of) was the thickness of a coin on one end. I know halibut isn't cheap, but either increase the price or just don't offer it - as it was I felt a little insulted.   So with all these complaints, why 4 stars?  The other fish types taste great, fries were great, everything they fry is great (as evidenced by all the photos of the desserts here), and it's a good value... As long as you stay away from the halibut!"}
{"text":"This place is small and you'd drive right by it if you weren't looking for it but the dine in and takeout are both great. Prices are affordable and don't forget to try the deep fried mars bar."}
{"text":"Their Haddock and Chips is the best thing on the menu.  The batter is light a d the fish does not have that fishy taste.  Dispute all the great reviews on the Halibut, it is not good (you want good Halibut go down to Mccowan and Lawrence).  Their service is not that great and my biggest pet peeve here- the tartar sauce is not homemade (it is packaged)."}
{"text":"The fish & chips are the real deal, its my go to place for fish and chips in the east end of the city. Also their deep friend oreos are to die for."}
{"text":"Hubby had been wanting to check this place out for a while so we made it there finally.  We went on a Wednesday because kids eat free with the purchase of an adult entree. One adult entree purchased = 1 free kids meal.    I ordered the haddock and chips for $12.45 and my hubby ordered the cod and chips for $10.95. Kiddies got chicken and chips, and their meals included pop and an ice cream for dessert. So I think price wise, it was pretty reasonable - $24 for a family of four! The portions were big as well.  I got a large piece of haddock and lots of fries - I couldn't finish it all.   The haddock itself was good - the batter was crispy and light, and the fish was soft and yummy.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.   So why the four stars? Service was a little slow.  I know this restaurant is a small business and there were only two waitresses working, but the restaurant wasn't that busy.   However, I enjoyed the experience overall.  Good food and I liked the atmosphere of the place. It had a nice family feel to it."}
{"text":"omg SO SO BAD for 21$ I got 1 pc of fish, chips and a steak pie no bigger than the palm of my hand. Fish was soggy and greasy, meat pie was deep fried and had clearly exploded....just one big disgusting mess.......NEVER AGAIN.; The girl that took our order was either new or liked to make people feel awkward."}
{"text":"This is a cool find. The restaurant looks like the kind I remember as a kid. It is simple and practical. Not fancy. The service was friendly. I enjoyed my fish and chips and the waitress made helpful suggestions. The fish and chips were the old fashion kind. Straightforward and tasty. If you want something more unusual or something that is lean and light on calories, then you may prefer something else. If you are craving good old fashion fish and chips, this is a great place."}
{"text":"St Andrews Fish and Chips is located in one of those strip in Scarborough. I have been shopping at the Global Pets next door for a few years and I never even notice its existence...  My fellow yelper said let's try Fish and Chips... hmmm You know I don't like Deep Fried food too much or non Asian food... but what the heck!  I am happy that I have lunch here, not only it has reasonably priced lunch specials $6.45 each.  The fish is coated in a light batter, deep fried to golden crispy colour,  It  is not too oily and not fishy for sure.    My advice is don't order the soup.. the clam chowder is the canned type.  The Deep Fried Oreos with ice cream for sure is a nice surprise! Yummmmy!  Now I know where to go if I have cravings for some Fish and Chips and of course deep fried desserts!!  They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place as it claims to specialize in fish and chips. I ordered the haddock and fries and deep fried mars bar. The haddock was yummy but nothing spectacular, the outter batter was delicious and inside it did taste fresh. The fries were very fresh tasting and i enjoyed it. It was really disappointing that the tarter sauce was prepackaged and it tasted disgusting. The deep fried mars bar was disgusting, they used the same batter they used for the fish so it tasted odd which was disappointing. Whenever i do get a fish and chips craving I won't come back here."}
