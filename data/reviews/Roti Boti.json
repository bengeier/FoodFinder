{"text":"I came here yesterday night for the first time as I looked to the reviews and they didn't seem THAT BAD. So I told myself why not give it a try. I asked about the chicken thali and the lady told me they would serve Murgh Makhani (butter chicken for those who don't know) with a piece of tandoori chicken, chickpeas, salad, rice and Naan. Seemed a pretty nice deal to me. She asked me what spicy intensity I wanted and I said medium. I asked how long before its ready she told me 10min no more than 20. I was there at 22:15 and they close at 11. Anyways. They were 3 guys that ordered to eat there after I came. And while I was waiting, the owner's family kids cousins uncle aunties came and took a sit. Who were served first? Yup. His own family. How long did I had to wait for my food? 30 min. I paid, went home. When I opened the package there was this bad odour. I swear it was far from a smell of freshly made food. The murgh makhani tasted so bad, I was even scared to be sick as this was just horrible. It tasted extremely sour as if they put lime or as if the yogurt/cream was over expired. Not to say that they put way too much kasuri methi (the dark stuff in the picture in the sauce). The tandoori didn't taste anything but chicken. Not even salt, not even marinated, no tandoor. Nothing. It just looked as they put food coloring and that's it. I asked medium spicy and they forgot. And the rice stank as it they over put asafetida and anyone who knows about this spice knows how we have to handle it with such delicacy. Just to let you know I grow up with these food at home. I had 2 choices either return it or throw it. I called the restaurant 3 times and they didn't want to answer. So I only ate the Chickpeas/salad and Naan. What a waste. Called the restaurant today to know what happened with what I got serve because either they gave me an expired butter chicken or they served me something I didn't asked. The owner started shouting at me even though I didn't finished what I had to say and I was being very polite with him. Shouting at me, he was stating that it is the way they do, that \"this is the original butter chicken\"  but with their recipe blabla. If I don't like, it's not his problem. And when he finished his speech, he hung up. \"What a gentleman\". I called back, I let him know that it wasn't professional from him to do that and again he started shouting and I told him I grew up with these foods at home and there might have been a mistake from them but owner is too proud and not open for communication. As he was out of control, I told him I cannot stand talking with someone with such behaviour so assalamu alaikum. I won't recommend to anyone to come here. Go to Darbar, Malhi Sweet or Pushap but not here. Salam."}
{"text":"Roti Boti offers authentic Indian cuisine with a Pakistani spin to the menu.   Service was slow but meals are freshly made. Language barrier is definitely an issue but pointing at the right things on the menu and a little patience is more than enough to get that delicious Indian food to come your way!  Overall, this truly felt like a intimate home cooked food as if you've been humbly invited to their home. I enjoyed it a lot!  I'll however dock a star due to an apparently lack of heat when it is cold outside. On my 2nd visit it was too hot... lol.   Price tag for two was $26. Good value."}
