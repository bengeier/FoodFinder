{"text":"This place is terrible!  One star is generous for this place. I hope the owners realize their place is a dump! The food is old and tasteless. Its messy and the restaurant is unkept. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. They do have an \"A\" rating but that food is just plain bad! We used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as Asia Buffet. The place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap. No quality, no taste kind of food and cheap. It is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant. I will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation. Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto. Bad, cheap food attracts the bad customers? lol"}
{"text":"This is probably the cheapest buffet I've ever been to. Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place. Just remember to make the best deal out of a buffet, make sure you come hungry."}
{"text":"So disappointed at China Star Buffet today! Since it is one of the most affordable n closes to where I live. I do enjoy eating here many times before until today. The lousy service at Asian restaurants r never a bother to me. I found it to be unique n part of its charm. But until today! I feel disgust n ashamed at what the waitress there said about locals. I know China Star Buffet gets alot of tourist business by the bus load daily! Like most Asian buffet in the LV area. They mostly depend on these tourists to keep their business afloat. But talking negative about your royal local customers is a no no. The waitress was telling one of the tourists in Mandarin to sit with his group. She said most locals will not paid for their meal n pretend to be part of the tourist group. It is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. But of hearing her saying it in my face is an insult to us local patrons. I've heard of some Asian buffets do not serve locals when they have truck loads of tourists coming in. But having such crazy accusations about your local patrons is harsh n unappreciative! I will just take my hard earn dollars somewhere else from now on!"}
{"text":"You get what you paid for! Room temp food and not so Mongolian tasting BBQ! No sushi!!!!!! Krazy buffet on Sahara has sushi and it is only $1 more. 2 stars because of the friendliness of the staff! And you pay before you eat."}
{"text":"worst buffet ever !!!!!!bad service  broken tables they even have the balls to tell u becarful the seat is broken i mean wtf never coming here agin amd what buffet charges for drinks!!!!! water is from the sink and drinks taste baddddd....... food taste nasty !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best place but cheap so I went.  The girl up front was rude but smoking hot!  Anyways back to the food.  Run of the mill chinese fast food, but extra greasy.  They don't drain the oil off their fried foods so it puddles at the bottom of the trays so all the food soaks up the oil.  The mongolian barbecue was decent, liked the shrimp.  Not many choices on vegetables though.  And not many choices are sauce, but much more than most in Vegas, at least you can put it in yourself."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 0 if I could. Food here is old, dry and bland. I was afraid to try anything. If it looks bad coming out, what the heck does the kitchen look like? Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Limited selection in food.  Food was dry with no taste.  Good customer service but About the only thing good in this place was the cute waitress."}
{"text":"The place is pretty much you get what you paid for. Hubby and I were in Vegas trying to find cheap places to eat, came across china star buffet, the dinner was $8.99 per person, and since it was a buffet I thought it's cheap for 2 both of us ate for under $20.   There wasn't much to choose from, food overall was dry and salty... The ice cream cones were placed out in the open, I find it unsanitary.. But like I said, you get what you paid for at that place.. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly, so we just paid the bill and left.. Didn't leave any tips and also didn't see a need since we got our own food anyway.."}
{"text":"One word: DISGUSTING! Walking up to the restaurant tells the whole story. Dirty, grimy, and flavorless! Everything is greasy the floors, tables, windows, crane game, plates.   The food is GREASY dripping GREASY! The waiter dropped the food left on the table onto the floor then swept it up.   I was so upset I asked for the owner supposedly he wasn't there. I made sure I pointed out the filth throughout the restaurant to the man I spoke with. He profusely apologized and said they would try to solve the problems. I said, I would never find out because I will NEVER return! BTW..never did it cross his mind to take a meal off our bill (which I didn't except).  If the filth is where the public can see it, I can't imagine how the kitchen is.   BTW..I looked at the pictures for the restaurant and the owner who 'wasn't there' is the man I spoke with the same shirt. He refused to admit he was the owner! How sad!   Don't compromise your sense of worth for  the \"value price\"!"}
{"text":"used to love coming to eat here last time i was here was 5yrs ago now omg service sucked asked waiter for a high chair 3 times, the floor looked so old wall was scrapped, bathroom was so bad my daughter wouldn't use it, variety of food was not that great some food had no taste"}
{"text":"Before you even walk into China Star you can take a deep whiff and know, 'Yup I'm at china star'.  The excellent service is only surpassed by the quality of their food and ingredients.  I can honestly say without hyperbole that this is twice as good as any other Chinese food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I  went to this location once and have never been back, as the food actually sucked. I went for lunch not too long after the place opened for the day and it seemed to me that the food that was out was left over from the previous night. When leaving to pay the guy at the counter asked me how it was and I was honest and said I usually never complain but this was terrible."}
{"text":"For a neighboorhood dumpy place the food is ok here, the lunch price is fine, and like the fact that even to go plates are the same price(other locations add a dollar or two for take out). There is enough of a selection of what I like to keep me coming back from time to time."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY !! This is the very worst place I have eaten in my 45 years of dining out. The food labeling was in alien form and the food was GREASY disgustingly laid out with each and every supposingly clean plate was not at all very clean , evidently they do not use dish detergent to clean most likely use only cold water !   The service was non existent , our table when 1st sitting down the waiter came over saw that there were crumbs left on our table before we even ate and he took his hand and wiped the crumbs onto the floor  and it wasn't more than 5 minutes past when my wife noticed 2 roaches starting to dine on the crumbs so disgusting we called the waiter back and he said he would get a broom and sweep the bugs away I said just do whatever we are leaving  the cashier said to us to pay and we didn't even start to eat yet I told them pay for what ?  didn't eat or drink THE HEALTH DEPT SHOULD SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN IMMEDIATELY !!!    Another note, the couple before us leaving argued with the casher about age of their son , just ridiculous this place !!!  I have never gave such a review on any restaurant in my life but just had to this time."}
{"text":"the service was nothing great, the waitress looked like she was mad dogging us the whole time, food could have been better with flavor,a little bland, and the texture of the meat felt like it was sitting there too long.. prices are really cheap though, so if you on a budget this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Just disgusting. Super old food, not kept at proper temperatures. Cockroaches runing around, chasing the flies around the food islands. Awful tasting food, awful environment, awfully dissapointed people eating food I wouldn't feed my cats. We didn't pay for dinner because we complained to the manager. Turns out, when we got home we realized we did pay for dinner, if you know what I mean..."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. They bus in Chinese tourist so can be very crowded and hectic at times."}
{"text":"Nothin special, just a good ol' fashioned Chinese buffet at a decent price."}
{"text":"It is now called BJ Buffet, and it's under \"new\" new ownership.  The advertised price is now $6.99 all day, every day.  This place has really gone downhill fast.  The food quality is lacking and the food has gotten \"cheaper\".  There used to be things like teriyaki chicken on a stick, orange chicken, shrimp, and other staples.    But now those items are gone, and there is actually sliced tomatoes and hard boiled eggs available.  The service has gone down also.  You have to ask for things like refills now.    I am giving it two stars because the food is edible.  It still has Mongolian BBQ, but even there are only few vegetables available now.  I was with a large party if people and none of us expect to be back."}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 4 at best.  If you are looking for purely quantity and quality is not an issue, the $5.99 for lunch is a good price.  The food is adequate.  It will keep you from starvation yes.  Is it good, well, in regards to other buffets, I give it so so at best.  If you are in a crunch then go ahead but dont expexct much.  There is ZERO atmosphere.  The place looks like a 70\"s cafeteria.  The service is good, the servers were quick to clear dishes and refill my drink."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and never had a major issue.  Lunch is only $5.99. If at $5.99 you expect high end, then go somewhere else.  Have realistic expectations and you'll like it just fine."}
{"text":"This was my second time to China Star buffet...I was looking for a cheap lunch buffet, but the signs on the outside contradict each other; one says $5.99 until 4pm and the other, which I didn't see, was Sunday all day $8.99. They could use some clarification.   The food was pretty old- I had to spit out a couple bites of my food because they tasted funny or I could not chew it. The \"Mongolian BBQ\" portion was okay though.   The service was severely lacking- it took asking to get water refills, and the girl at the front desk was a little nasty.  I would not go back here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is not my first time here.  On previous times I've been here the experience has been more than sub-par... but today I couldn't figure out what to eat so I landed here.  Figured there's a banner outside that said under new management so I'd give 'em yet another try.     On first glance the joint looks glammed up a bit more than on previous trips here.  You know a lil extra decor here, a lil decor there... I end up making my way to an available table, got my drink order in then made my way to the buffet line.  At that exact point I realize my mistake of giving this place another shot.     I opted for the broccoli beef, bbq pork, general Tsao chicken and some vegetable fried rice.  All except the rice looked fairly unpleasing (like they been left in the tray too long and yet those were their best options).  Got back to my table and dug into the pork and found it was so overdone, it was dry and hard.  The beef was so rubbery, the broccoli way overcooked and dark.  And the rice although good looking was so hard and undercooked that I almost broke teeth and lost a few fillings.  Left that after a few bites, then noticed I'd get some shrimp they had just taken out and figured I'd take advantage of something fresh.  Fresh it was and salty as heck too, making me sip my Pepsi away in two gulps to counter the Salton Sea I had just ingested.     In all this not a good place to eat.  I've been here 3 times.  As the old saying goes, \"3 strikes and you're out.\"  Yes it's under new management, but it must be the same crummy cooks and perhaps the same motto applies to this management of leaving old food in the tray and making it look so unappetizing that they don't care.  They must be rich to not care to make a quality product, scratch that, decent product.      2 of 5 for their decor and their attentive waiters.  I so wanted to give this place a shot, but alas, fool me three times shame on me..."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Avoid eating here if at all possible. My aunt and I went and the food was not fresh and it definitely wasn't tasty at all. The service sucked and when I attempted to point out a problem to the cashier (who said he was the manager) he didn't take the complaint seriously. They use dark meat chicken instead of white meat, which by the way tastes absolutely NASTY! The only reason this got one star is because their interior is decent. They up the price on weekends and holidays which isn't worth it. Even the normal price of $9 is a lot for a crappy buffet that serves nasty food. I'll certainly never be returning ever again and I encourage you to not go there either. It's not worth even going. I'd rather go eat at Panda Express and I'm not a huge fan of them to begin with, but their food is a lot better than this buffet's."}
{"text":"I regret stepping foot in this filthy Chinese buffet.. The food was absolutely horrible no taste! Really??? Who has Mexican cooks it's a Chinese buffet !! The thing that really upset me was that my bf said he saw a roach crawl right next to the food! He said he didn't mind and just flicked it off!!! Ewwwww Note: he told me this after we left ! I almost vomited in the car! I wanted to go back and complain I was too far already!! This place needs to be closed by the health department Be Aware !!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting LV, stayed nearby, went with family group. Large, open, not fancy; typical buffet-style. Food typical again, more seafood than some. Fair selection of Chinese staples, most having visited the fryer. Contrary to some other reviews, I found the quality very fine and selection quite broad. Fine service and helpful staff. I'd go again, my best recommendation."}
{"text":"Look you cant ask for much when your paying $4.99 for a lunch buffet.  But honestly this place was pretty darn good and clean!  The broccoli was super fresh when we were here at around 1:00.  The place is in a more Hispanic part of Vegas and was decently busy which meant fresh food :).  Much better than the other Chinese food place off Tropicana that has been shut down 3 times.  Service was ok..I had to ask for more water but hey for $4.99 im ok with that.  I think they even will give you a togo box if you ask for one...CRAZY"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this restaurant is it rated higher. I'm from Hawaii and it is there. Food is fresh and tasty and very excellent selection. The best thing is the price only $5.99 for lunch or $8.99 for dinner. My brother from Sacramento says this is way better than anything in Sacramento as well. The price the quality of the food and everything else is just terrific."}
{"text":"Went in the first time and the atmosphere wasn't great. The food was dry and not great. I know it's a buffet, but the food was not good. After eating, I was paying my bill and was going to tip, the lady had already added the gratitude. Besides that, most of the staff were nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! First time I find the Buffet for the cheap price! It's amazing to have a lot of food for only 7$!"}
{"text":"I know i'll be sorry, and its been a long long time ~   Let's just say i used to spend more time at this joint than i have in recent years, but it was long a favorite in the UNLV community. Certainly not Fine Dining but good / cheap eats.     Vegas has had some rough years ~ glad to see China Star survives, and recent reviews are actually pretty good. ."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how a buffet could have cold, overcooked food at opening time, but it did. The rampant, morbid obesity, and the emphasis on deep fried, fatty, flavorless, foods should have clued me in. Hey, it is cheap and you will get what you paid for.  Stay away. There are several restaurants nearby that are inexpensive and worth it."}
{"text":"I clearly hate myself.  There's no other reason that I would ever eat at China Star Buffet.  I know it's bad food.  I know it will cause a stomach ache.  And yet I occasionally agree to eat here.  Something is seriously wrong with me.  Why?  Well the buffet items alternate between tasteless and awful.  The meat in the Chinese dishes is stringy and fatty and has random parts of bone in it (at least I hope it was bone.  It might have been a pebble).  It's the kind of buffet where you end up eating only fried food because that feels safer.  And at least there's some taste if the item is fried.  Bottom line: don't get sucked in by the cheap-as-dirt pricing.  Even at rock-bottom buffet pricing, it ain't worth it."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 2 or 3 times a week.  (When your husband/life partner has to be on a low carb diet, it's cheaper than trying to stock up on groceries.)  I love the selection and freshness. I've eaten at numerous ones when I lived in Los Angeles and have tried more than a few since I moved to Vegas but this one is one of my all time favorites. I think I'll go there now!"}
{"text":"Ok so first off we arrived at 3:35 pm & they had almost no food and definitely no shrimp or crab. I asked the waitress she said it will be put out at 4pm and it was but the manager put a sign up that said \"FOR DINNER CUSTOMERS ONLY\" Well I still went & got crab so she went up to me said now you pay for dinner. It was funny but I was totally ok with that. 2 stars is for the food it was not good and the restrooms were horrible. The cost for two dinners with the drinks and tax included was $23 that's not even the price for one on the strip. Won't be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It not the best chinese food nor would I put it anywhere near top of my favorite list chinese. What I feel it does is fill the stomach after great workout at the gym. NOT all the stuff is blah, average, or no flavor. I had the salt and pepper shrimp got two servings of that yummy. I enjoy the hot and sour soup. It pretty diverse for small buffet in comparison too hotels. They have all the standard ones kung pau chicken, fried rice, and goes on and on. Like said it hit or miss find couple of good ones. Times some maybe not going through as much so it was warm at best. The popular choices they tend not too replace them as quick as the other ones. They have mongolian bbq section pick your protein and some assorted vegetables cook it up for you. I was hunger not feel like waiting but it look good. The food nothing going too wow you but it is WHAT it is cheap chinese buffet food. Ok.  It just changed management so the interior is lot nicer then before. It been while came here for lunch couple of times. The management tell greeted with great smile and sense the enthusiasm like new ownership in the building. Drinks I could not even get it halfway down before server filled it back up. Something that liked compare too hotels the server really on it came too each time went back up came back took old dishes away.   Overall say its ok. It not something that be regular but if looking for some cheap food fill you up got no problem with China Star Buffet."}
{"text":"yuck. my body hurts from eating the food and my soul hurts for making my body do it. Barf-o :("}
{"text":"I actually come here pretty often. Don't know why. Restrooms are  such a mess they should clean it more often. Service is not bad but not good they should hire more people cause they are always busy but only have 2 or 3 people tending to customers. We didn't get drinks until second plates. You have to pay extra for drinks, don't ask for water cause its nasty. They don't refill the good stuff, like the oysters and crab. You could be there at least and they won't refill them. I think its more of trick if they don't want to refill them they should just stop serving it cause thats why we are there for. Their egg roll are huge. Mongolian station is pretty good and fast. Salmon is good but often has bones. Nice location."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is not worth a cent of your money, even if you are strapped for cash. McDonalds is better than this place. Food was gross, service sucked, and the place stunk so bad. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I'm scared to even know how sanitized this place even is. I could see someone getting sick from the food here. Clean bowls are dirty. Clean plates were dirty.  This place is a dump."}
{"text":"This is THE worst excuse for a Chinese buffet I have ever seen. Zero flavor to any of the dishes. Can't believe they are as busy as they where."}
{"text":"Update 2/12 - This place has hit the skids = The last 2 times I have been there it was for lunch and the majority of the buffet was empty. Now granted both times it was busy, but that no excuse. If I wanted to only eat steamed brocoli I'd save myself the trouble and stay at home. I say fool me once SHAME ON YOU, Fool me Twice SHAME ON ME....I wont be back again and instead will go to BUFFET @ ASIA where they have NEVER failed to come through!!  This was my previous post-  Its nothing special & your usual chinese menu fare. I try & eat on the healthy side sticking wt the steamed brocolli, sauted onions, red/green peppers in beef over some noodles, some spicey soup wt shrimp & a few spring rolls.   I usually eat there late in the day & this tends to be not only lunch, but dinner too. What a bargain as wt tax the bill comes to $5.50 (I leave $7 & everyone leaves happy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food was so bad that it was actually entertaining to see all these people eating this crap, it was really busy! My hats off to the owner, what a business. He just needs some clowns."}
{"text":"If you think this place is ok then obviously you dont know what to look for. I agree with the restrooms being absolutely disgusting every time ive been here.it grosses me out to think about whos in charge here and are their kitchen practices or personnel / personal hygeine  ok? The girl at the front is very rude and didnt say 1 word or thanks when we paid.....just gave me the receipt???  General Tsos chicken taste like deep fat fryer scraps of rubber? Sweet and sour sauce is horrible....tastes like water?       It USED to be fresher but its obviously going down hill for them? Ive chosen other places as my favorite. Rice n noodle (windmill - s. jones) and Baidu (robindale -s. jones) Blows them away!!!! I will no longer be returning .....Sorry Nooooo I should be saying thanks!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was lacking. Most was way over cooked from sitting to long."}
{"text":"Yes, it's cheap but cheap does not have to equal disgusting.   This food was GROSS and obviously had been left out for a while.  Believe me,  I love greasy, Americanized chinese food but this was beyond anything I've ever tasted. Not fresh. Lettuce at salad bar looked wilted so I tried most of the chicken dishes, chow mein and rice and was not a happy camper.   Everything just tasted like it had been re-heated after having been left out at least a day.   Service was non-existent, I went during lunch and there were probably 2 or 3 other families besides mine so not sure what the problem was.  I really wanted to like this place as it close to home but hey there a zillion other buffets like this to settle for this one! Next...."}
{"text":"Decent food. Chicken teriyaki was tender. Rest of the food was ehhh..... Aright. Can't beat the 4.99 lunch;for a limited time."}
{"text":"The food is decent but this place is super dingy and the cashier hostess lady is super rude. My mom loves coming here since its so close to home and cheap but ugh I hate the service. I swear every time I've come here the lady up front is eating while she shows you to your table. Like you just shoved a piece of chicken in your mouth with your hands and you want me to be okay with you handling my silverware? No thanks ;-; that's why I always get chopsticks."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass. The only thing good about here is their dinner food. They had no sushi. Their place is so dirty and the waiters took so long to refill drinks or take the plates. They also take about 30 mins before they attend to a dirty table to clean it. Me and my friend went here and were seated at a corner table, and we didn't notice the crumbs sitting on it, until the waiter came to take our order of drinks and wiped them off. He was also impatient, as we were thinking if we wanted to get lunch or dinner, since it was 3:45 p.m. He just told us to get what we want and he'll charge later depending if we get the dinner food. Every time me and my friend get up to get food, the waiter and a waitress from another table, kept staring at us, thinking we're going to do something shady. I went to get the lunch entrees and my date just got a piece of shrimp from the dinner entree and we didn't think that they were going to charge us for that, and so the waiter came to give us the check and we were charged for just lunch. When I was paying up front, the manager or the owner said that the waiter made a mistake and instead charged me for the dinner. I didn't even see him talking to that waiter the whole time, so how would he know that he made a mistake. Also, their teriyaki chicken fucking sucks. It has no sauce, and is bland. Their cones are also on the opposite end of the ice cream machine. I was searching for 5 minutes where it was and the waiter didn't even bother to help us until I went to ask him.  SCREW THIS PLACE! DON'T GO HERE 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY PUT DINNER ON THE SERVINGS. THEY WILL TRICK YOU. NEVER GOING BACK HERE."}
{"text":"Ive only been here a few times. My wife and her family introduced me to the place shortly after we meet a few years ago...so here is my review:  On this latest visit, it was a pleasant experience. The prices are very good and legit for lunch hour. I dont think anyone can beat a 5.oo lunch with the selection they have...just dont think its possible. Anyway, food was fresh and at good temp and taste really good. They have a decent selection of items which is always important. The diner was decently clean, no issues with the floor layout cleanness. I didnt go to the rest room during this visit so i cant speak on that on this review. We had a busser serving us and he was on point. His name is Danny, i know that because i asked him before we left. He was helpful, polite and humble. He made our visit pleasant. We had our refills in decent time and our table was clean for the most part.  I have been to this place in previous visits and havent had that great of experience so thats why i am giving it 3 stars for the overall visits. This time everything was in order and nice. We got full, there were no interuptions and no other customers getting out of hand unlike our previous times. I want to give a kudos to them this time...thank you for the good prices and the busser Danny for the great humble and polite service...!"}
{"text":"Quantity over quality.  What can I say if you want to consume mass quantities for next to nothing come here.  Although I did not get sick, the food is marginal at best.   You have been warned."}
{"text":"The food was good nothing that really standed out. The place just like it got remodeled it was clean everyone is friendly. They have several busses that pull up with Asian tourist don't let that scare you they have plenty of room. It's $9.97 for the dinner. You can get some to-go box and stuff it full of your favorite foods and probably feed two people if you want or just buying any for the price of that."}
{"text":"As an asian, I feel like I should apologize on behalf of all asians for this craptastic place."}
{"text":"OK, the atmosphere is pretty blah, but it looked clean enough and the stainless steel buffet lines looked like hospital equipment. Perhaps not that inviting, but it was looking pretty shiny the night we were there.   Layout was a little strange, as were some of the selections: salad bar was in the back row, along with the dessert, and in addition to Asian appearing dishes were pizza, french fries, garlic bread, palmieres, cheese-baked mussels, onion rings - you get the drift. Maybe not authentic Cantonese, but something familiar to please timid palates like your kids and whiny sister-in-law.  As for the \"authentic\" stuff, the noodles looked swollen and mushy, but the fried rice was fine, orange chicken was comparable to Panda Express, for what that's worth,and they had fried shrimp and even crabs, although they looked too puny to bother with. I don't like working that hard for my food.   For some reason, Babygirl and I were both craving broccoli (probably because I haven't cooked anything in ages that didn't involve melted cheese and the deep fryer), so we both actually picked around the meat and took all the vegetables, which were cooked pretty nicely.  Still, it might have been a two star experience, but, the staff was pleasant, it was less than 10 bucks (well, not including drinks), and, can you say \"All the cream cheese rangoons you can eat?\" Believe me, we got our money's worth!  (And for the record, I'm scratching my head a little over the review from the person with female sounding name who claimed to observe a male employee in the restroom not washing his hands. Who was in whose bathroom? Deep thoughts.)"}
{"text":"I used to like the food here but last time we went we caught the waiter spitting into a pile of dirty dishes.  I know they werent clean but there was no need to add a phlegm.   Completely unacceptable.  We confronted him but he did not speak english.   It was a very bad experience.  Even with good food we wont be able to trust this place again."}
{"text":"Compared with other Chinese buffets, this one is much better but I still give a so-so about it. This buffet is comparatively cleaner than other Chinese buffets I've been. And the food are preserved comparatively better before eating. However not going again. Because I still can't stand the cup which looked like just gone through a splash of water and it's done... that kind of cleaning... without sanitizing or any processing, ugh."}
{"text":"My family has eaten at China Star for years. Yesterday we were there to eat and I was in the restroom the employee who put the food out did not wash his hands and went back to the kitchen.  The manger said there a sink in the kitchen area. I said I do not work here how would I know that and to have the employee touch multiple surfaces to get the sink when there one in the bathroom even. Have they heard of cross contamination. And to top it off my wife became ill from eating the white rice.  So we have decided to say no more excuses were done. Time to move on. If you choose to eat there check the buffet before  you eat your stomach will thank you. I have to give it a atar, but for me it would be a negative star if possible"}
{"text":"I went there after 12:30 it was crowded, & Loud w/children crying and complaining.  The food on a scale of 1-10, I would rate a 4.9.  Some food was heated properly, some was not.  The Hot Sour soup was very good.  Chicken wings were good, so was the Hunan Beef, the fried rice was bland and tasteless.  The best thing was that it was reasonably priced....I guess that means it wasn't all that good but there was a lot of it at a reasonable price.(Meant to be funny)  A lot of the spanish men were in undershirts that were dirty, which isn't the fault of the resturant, but you'd think there would be some sort of notice to at least be clean.  The waitress was quick and kept my drink refilled, was polite, and appeared overworked.  A eat cheaply, and go type of place with a spanish working type crowd."}
{"text":"China star has a $4.99 asian lunch buffet from 11 am to 4 pm. That's the selling point, it is cheap.    Basically, China star is an all you can eat panda express, so instead of paying a couple dollars more for a 3 item plate you can come here and get more food for less.  As you would expect, the food isn't that great.  They don't have any big ticket items like sushi, oysters, or crab legs. The Wonton soup was bland, but the sweet and sour soup was good. The orange chicken was soggy.  The pizza was not bad but not good. The thai chicken was too dry and tasted like they had put Tapatio in it. Their fried rice and chow mein was okay.  The servers were friendly.    Bottom line: despite it being an all you can eat place, you don't really want to eat all you can of anything thing being served. (unless you really like soft serve ice cream)"}
{"text":"Best hang over meal in town! Cheap Cheap Cheap! Basic Chinese - noodles, rice, chicken, pork, shrimp. Don't expect fine dining or top quality, it is what it is, you can't beat the price and needless to say, you won't leave hungry.  Great for large groups!"}
{"text":"As buffet goes this place is comparable to the more expensive ones in the area buffet@asia and lees. Very surprised at seeing the seafood selection. Overall good experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Should have read Yelp* reviews before eating here.  Spent 2 days recuperating from stomach trouble at the hotel while my partner threw up.  Not worth gambling your health for cheap food."}
{"text":"Very bad costumer service they where very rude kept staring at us eating for like minutes at a time so not only did we feel rushed but even when we payed my mom is handicap and she was about to get up and the ladies where reaching over to get our plates and when we did complain about it nothing got done furthermore they kept watching us when we got in our own car!!"}
{"text":"My mom still likes this place (even though the takeout containers seem to get smaller and smaller). It's super busy and super cheap. As far as asian buffets go, it's popular and we did go here quite a bit when it first opened up but then, the quality was pretty high. It's the only successful restaurant tenant (I remember when it was a soul food restaurant years ago). I prefer the food (quality and selection is better) and ambiance (much nicer) at Buffet @ Asia on eastern/flamingo."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for places to eat, while in Vegas, and we came upon this buffet. We thought we'd try it out since it was an all-you-can-eat buffet for $9.99.  I thought, coming into this buffet, the food would be good. It was alright. The food was salty, and some were even cold. The service there was friendly, even though you could barely hear what they are asking you."}
{"text":"Low-grade Chinese food. Veggies were not fresh; salmon sushi looked dry and gross. Overall: Bland. Sure, the staff was friendly and attentive but you come to buffets to swine-out and not admire the cheesy decor. Price should've been $4.99 for that buffet."}
{"text":"$9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Dinner Buffet w/Crab Legs  If you like Chinese food like sweet n sour chicken,lots of seafood stuff like crawfish,crab legs,shrimp and fish.  They did have bbq pork but it was kinda tough.  Several different soup options, around 60 items to choose from total. Pretty standard chinese buffet fair.  They do cook Mongolian \"made-to-order\" and they have soft serve ice cream.  Really can't complain for $10 pp but I'm no fan of asian food to start this certainly did nothing to change my mind.  Pretty boring and fishy! But still good cheap eats for those that like Chinese Cuisine."}
{"text":"4.99 for lunch buffet... Decent chinese dishes and for the price you can't beat it!!!"}
{"text":"I just ate here and the food was good.  They have good selection and not dirty.  I have paid $15 for a buffet like this and it was like $8.  That being said I wouldn't take a date here or any cheap chinese buffet for that matter, but for friends and fam why not."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the fortune cookie BEFORE I ate here:  \"you will be disappointed with your meal today\" is what the fortune cookie read.  Truer words have never been spoken!   A little backstory: I saw this place while I was shopping at the beauty warehouse in the same parking lot, and the big sign that said \"Lunch Buffett $5.99\" caught my eye..Chinese buffets are usually pretty affordable for lunch, so I didn't think the price was any indicator of the quality of the buffet.    WRONG!   This is the first time since 2007 that I've tried a new restaurant without reviewing yelp first. Why oh why didn't I check the reviews?    Perhaps the \"air conditioner stolen\" sign (see photo) should have been an indicator of something. My \"buffet preview\" revealed a semi-decent selection, but the food was greasy, old, cold, greasy, disgusting, oh and did I mention GREASY?   I picked up several \"clean\" plates that had food debris all over them. The food wasn't labeled correctly, and it just looked sad.  Speaking of sad, I learned a valuable lesson: before deciding to eat at an establishment, I will ALWAYS check the expressions of the patrons. Everyone dining there looked depressed to say the least. I felt the same way after dining there. They should be handing out Prozac with the fortune cookies.  My dining partner \"paid\" for the meal shortly thereafter in the bathroom across the street.  My goodness! Save your money and your appetite."}
{"text":"so i came in when this place had an insane rush  ...fuck this place to hell never will i come here again worst customer service of my life i got food sat down was goin to eat and manager came to my seat said who said u can shit here he pickup my dish full of food and took it off the table i've never been so fuckin insulted in my fuckin life well at a restaurant he said u have to pay first ive are there before and that's not the case the manager of this place is a fuckin piece of fuckin shit how can u be this fuckin rude to a customer fuckin chink piece of shit fuck you so he basically embarrassed me infront of a whole crowd of fuckin people i go out to eat all the time and have never had such shitty customer service and or have been treated like such fuckin scum in my life well dinning a big fuck you to this place   !!!!i give your place zero stars bitch"}
{"text":"Don't even bother going here, they didn't even have good customer service at all, it was terrible"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese buffet in Vegas of my opinion the service is always amazing the food is great the price is great especially if you get to 699 lunch"}
{"text":"What can I say? It was a $5.40 (after tax) meal that was worth... $5.40. It wasn't great, I've had much better Chinese food, but it was decent enough.  The decor is very run-down, and the carpet has a lot of crap burned into it somehow. The seats aren't very comfortable either.  Will I go back? Not likely. Just because Golden China has a $6.00 lunch special that gives me enough food for leftovers."}
{"text":"Would be one star, but for the price ... less than $10 after tax and tip, including drink? Meh.  Cheap as Panda Express, but you can eat a variety of things."}
{"text":"The customers that come here are rude, the place is dirty and on top of all that the last time i ate here i went to grab a plate and a cockaroach crawled out from under the plates!!!  Never eat here. Not worth your money"}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short.  The food was bland and greasy. I didn't get to try the mongolian bbq, but my brothers said it wasn't that great. The food was so bad that I only ate 1 plate that I didn't even finish. 1 plate at a buffet? Yea, that bad. At least they had soft serve for dessert."}
{"text":"This is not a buffet if all they serve everything chicken nasty i asked the server if there any beef he said no beef only chicken?? Ill never go back there"}
{"text":"It took them a while to bring them a high chair for my nephew which made my sister sit in a booth for the start of our experience. The food is decent the vegetables have a funky after taste. It took them three tries to bring us Diet Coke and I still don't think it was Diet Coke, but after that many tries we gave up. Also they don't have a changing table in the bathroom for babies. The watermelon is juicy though and the fish and salmon were good."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate here someone had thrown up their food on the side of the entrance. It was so much vomit it looked like two people did it. No lie!   I couldn't believe that it wasn't a priority for them to clean up since it was a HUGE customer deterrent to say the least. After leaving the mediocre tasting Buffett, and seeing puke I never returned. Maybe other locations are better."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep allowing myself to get talked into buffets. I rarely ever enjoy them and the food is passable most of the time. I know you get what you pay for and it is not much by any means, but there are so many better options a block down.  I know I sound like the fool for coming here instead of going to Chinatown, but oh well. With all the people that flood this restaurant during the weekend, it is not all that important to have good service and it was apparent. Asian restaurants in general do not have good service, but no refills just pushed me off the edge."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. The service sucked and the food was disgusting. It didn't taste like how Chinese food should. If I had to eat here or starve I would rather starve. Stay FAR FAR FAR away from this place. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Let me cut the shit, this place is disgusting, the orange Chiken is gross, the rice is gross, the shrimp had shit on it, the booths were ripped apart, the floor was disgusting, everything about this place was disgusting I mean China star is obviously not a classy place to eat but for the same price you can go to the other location on decutur and Charleston wich is a million times better this place is just gross, I ate there 3 hours and I'm still disgusted"}
{"text":"Their food seems fresh always  when We go there ..maybe  because  is clos e toaHospital"}
{"text":"Came here because of the cheap price but a lot of buffets offer specials like this. This place had no character, the waitress had no character either, just came and left. Mandatory to tip 10%  the food wasn't very good. Best thing there was the jello.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This guy who is the owner of China Star is sooo cool and his staff are amazingly courteous and helpful, too.  China Star's food is served buffet style for lunch.  The food is authentic Chinese cuisine the way the Chinese cooks in the Chinese countryside cook.  If you are looking for blasphemized American Chinese food, do NOT eat here.  The food is for Chinese cuisine efficienados like my Mom, Mario, Mario's brother/sister, and myself!  BTW:  I told the owner that today was my Mom's birthday (6/27), so he sang a birthday song to my Mom and danced a jig for my Mom, too:  \"Cherry, cherry-Pai Gow, cherry cherry Pai Gow!\""}
{"text":"This location is nice and clean and fairly new. I was here a month and a half ago and I didn't see it in November when I was there. I know it's a bit late to write a review but the memory of this place had been ingrained in my mind. The restaurant is nice and clean. The food was alright. Basic Chinese fare. You have your sweet and sour chicken and beef and broccoli. Like Scott d. mentioned , they do have a mongolian grill. The reason why I remember this place distinctly was because I came home with the most terrible stomach ache. At first I thought it was indigestion so I went to the nearby CVS and bought some chewable tums. It didn't help, My dad got tired of me being in pain so he made me down some Cabernet. Surprisingly his remedy worked. Try this place out for a good cheap deal but be sure to have some wine on hand to ease that tummy ache."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that their lunch buffet is only $5.99, you are essentially getting what you paid for. I think the workers here are nice, but alas, you are coming here for the food. I could only eat the vegetables, and even that was not very pleasant. I avoided the fried food all together. I think their salad area was embarrassing as the salad appeared spoiled.  They did have a Mongolian BBQ station where you pick out the ingredients and there was a cook around the corner that would cook the food for you. Make sure you tip him though. There were not many ingredients to choose from. However, at least you are getting fresh cooked food on the spot."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Yelp. Never again. No.   I do not even know how to explain this place. I came here with my mother (whom she insisted to eat here by her suggestion) during lunch special. The deal was great and affordable however, the buffet layout and food was a tall tale for me.   The layout of the buffet was minimal and were VERY adjacent to each other. It may look like it doesn't serve that many choices and to the eyes of the buffet veteran, this may be some joke. lol when passing around, you can barely fit two people in between two buffet serving stands. I had to literally stand outside of it until it cleared before I went in and quickly grab what I needed.   The food: by the gods of food and wine, I have never been so disappointed. Probably the most cheapest and generic things I ever seen. Some of the food were so stale, especially the meat dishes, it's a disaster. I seen a \"chow mein\" dish and it was basically cheap, flimsy, almost-mushy, waxy ramen noodles sauté in yellow curry powder. How is that chow mein? And I seen labels that were marked \"dinner only\" for dishes that were not meant to be touched.   Really? I do not know. This place confuse me so much, I don't know whether the cooks were actually robots with no heart to put love into cooking. I asked my mother why this place, she agreed, I'll be making the choices on what places to eat. Lol  the eating experience wasn't worth my time. Cheap, flimsy food.   Overall, customer service was perhaps the only thing that saved this review from having a half star. The waiter and front desk were sweet people. However, food wise, I shall not recommend this to my friends or even my dear enemies."}
{"text":"overall everytime ive been there has been pretty solid, although there dinner isnt good- there lunch is pretty good. also i like that they seem to be pretty good about bringing stuff out."}
{"text":"Yes, you see that correct. That is a 5 star rating.  Is this the best buffet in all of the world? No. Is this the best buffet in all of Las Vegas? No.  What it is though, is the best Cheap Eats Chinese-American Food for under $10.  With the recent change to management, means completely new everything.   New Wait Staff. New Menu. New Prices. New interior decorations.   Wait Staff - I am not sad to see the old wait staff gone. Some of the girls were not the most friendly. The new staff seems to much more helpful, attentive and friendlier.  New Menu - You still get the basics. However, the food has changed in the flavor. There is definitely more pizazz to some of the food items. At lunch the other day, I had deep fried pork ribs, eggplant, fried tofu, baby bok choy and pad thai. All of it decent and pretty tasty.  New Prices - After tax, I paid $8.48 for AYCE lunch buffet. Price increase, but now you get a drink included. Before it was separate price for drink.  New Interior Decorations - I posted some pics and it is definitely more easy on the eye on the inside.   We went right at 11 am for lunch and they had hot, fresh food out and just kept putting more and more food out. For lunch and the price, they had a pretty good choice.   Now, I am not saying that this place is going to make your taste buds slap your mouth. But if you are hungry, in the mood for chinese-american and don't want to spend an arm and leg or want more bang for your buck, then YES this is your place to go."}
{"text":"Used to come here years ago and loved it. You definitely get what you pay for.. food all tasted the same and service was horrible. Never again"}
{"text":"I have been here before to try the buffet, which I didn't enjoy, so I'm obviously a glutton for punishment when I agreed to stop here for a to-go box. My fella was craving some greasy Chinese food and since it's close by we stopped to fill up a to-go container.   The price is the same whether you eat their buffet or take a small box to-go. Not sure why, since you're obviously going to get a smaller amount of food. I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets anyway, so this one really didn't do much for me. The food is greasy, overcooked and definitely not fresh. The food was sitting on the line entirely too long and dirty plates were sitting out, which was pretty unappetizing. All this didn't deter my determined fella. Service was ok, nothing spectacular. We filled up our plate, paid and were on our way lickety split. The food was even more tasteless than I expected. I took a bite and was pretty much done. I won't be back."}
