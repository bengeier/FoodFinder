{"text":"Cute little gem in Old Town Scottsdale!!!! Amazing lox and bagel.  Adorable gifts and great service"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for New Wave.  Gave this place a try for lunch with friends.  The food was fresh and healthy.   Service was provided by one of the owners and was great.  Baked goods looked amazing and I will definitely be heading back to pick up some mini cakes for our next party.  It was a little difficult to find.  It would be helpful if they were able to post their name somewhere more visible.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic! I went for breakfast and can I say WOW the Ghee Fried Egg Sandwich was fantastic especially because it comes on an Outstanding in house made salt bagel which was suggested. After finishing my sandwich I wasn't done. I indulged into the irresistible Chocolate Churro Croissant and wow. Grateful for hot delicious coffee with complimentary refill. This is going to get the #UncleEddieEats Oooooooooo #ThatsDelicious highest rating of 5 #HowUDoins because Owners Sergio & Country were as warm and welcoming and delightful as the food they make. Can't wait to go back this place is going on my regular stop list!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and delicious food. The staff is really friendly. I look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite vegetarian sandwich! I've been doing vegetarian for a very long time, so honestly I'm not easily impressed with the one veggie option at most places. I really should have taken a picture. It looked as good as it tasted! Totally excited to come back and try the cute, creative deserts. Had fun, kitschy things to buy & friendly service. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"I was having a sugar craving so I ran in to Super Chunk Sweets for their Blackout Cake and Peanut Butter Nanaimo treat. After polishing both off in a flash I was satiated. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Best Bakery and Breakfast & Lunch in Scottsdale. Everything is home made, the flavors are amazing. Oscar and his wife are the owners and so lovely. I could eat there every day that's how good it is!!"}
