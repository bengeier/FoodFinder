{"text":"Newland BBQ Square located in Scarborough is definitely a hidden gem! Similar to Mother dumplings located on Spadina in Downtown Toronto, they offer steamed buns, homemade soup noodles, pan-fried pancakes and more! It is a semi new restaurant that serves Northern Chinese food. The price is very affordable (under $10 per person), food is amazingly delicious and they have really nice servers. This place is probably one of the best places for Nothern Chinese food in the GTA, and comparable to the restaurants I tried in Beijing. My family and I (total of 4 people) went for the first time, ordered 7 dishes and only paid $20.26 after tax! I think for limited time from 11am-5pm, you get everything 50% off from the ordering paper. I also really enjoy this place because they do not use MSG in any of their dishes. I have been to this place twice already, will definitely revisit again! 

Here's a few things we ordered:

Infamous xialongbao. I would rate this 9/10. I usually dislike xialongboa because most places don't make them fresh, and have a really strong porky flavour to it. This place made it really well, the dumpling skin was thin, but thick enough so that when you pick it up, the skin won't break. The only downside to this dish was that it did not contain enough juice. The suggested way to eat this particular dumpling / bao is to pick it up with your chopstick, put it on your spoon, bite a little hole in the skin then pour some Chinese black vinegar and ginger strips in it. This dish came with 6 xialongboa (Rating: 9.5/10; Price $3). 

One of my all time favourites! This is a fried sweet red bean pancake. The rice pastry of this pancake was thin, crispy and fresh! It was just perfection! I enjoyed everything about it....especially when it came out super fresh and hot to touch! (Rate: 10/10; Price: $1.50)

Similar to the pancake above, this has similar pastry / pancake shell with semi sweet taro filling. This was my sister's favourite. (Rating: 9/10; Price $1.50)

This is a giant pan fried dumpling filled with glass noodles, eggs and chives. I enjoyed it, but would not order it again. (Rating: 6.5/10; Price: $2)

Look!!! We ordered 7 items and only cost us just under $21! If you're looking for a healthier alternative to dimsum, here's a suggestion :) 

We also ordered 2 types of noodles, da-lu noodles and stewed beef noodles. I guess I was too hungry and excited to take any photos (good thing they were large portions). The da-lu noodles was very clean tasting. It came with handmade noodles, shrimps, Chinese napas and mushrooms (Rating: 7/10; Price: $4). I would highly recommend the stewed beef noodles! It was absolute delish. The broth tasted very intricate - with many different fresh spices mixed in. The only downside to this dish was that the beef blocks were too big. (Rating: 9/10; Price $4).

{"text":"Not as much BBQ in the Traditional sense.
Does Kebabs count in your world of BBQ?
If it does, there's plenty of choices here.

Seasoned the Northern Chinese way.
Flavours of spices such as cumin seeds, chilis.
Think of it like a Chinese BBQ Rub.

Lu-cuisine of the Beijing style.
It's a refreshing flavour from the other ones,
Cantonese, Szechuan, Hunan from this neighbourhood.

Service varies depending on the crowd.
Decor is of the past predecessors, meh.
Don't like those old Grandpa-feel swivel chairs.
The place feels of Retirement Home.
I'm definitely not a Fan for sure.    2.5'd

609. Milk Fish Pot(11.99)
---
If you're a FISH person.  My Family devoured it.

Black Bean Clam(Typhoon Shelter-style)
---
Not exactly the HK style as it has Dry Chili Peppers.
Maybe a Northern adaptation.  Not bad.

312. Braised Pig's Intestine(11.99)
---
I wish this was more crispy outside.
Pork Fat rules?  Maybe too much, wow.

Good to Try too:

Grilled Squid Tentacles
621. Banana with Crispy Syrup
061. Lamb Kebabs(0.89per)
Wonton Chicken 

I thought this would be interesting to try.
Not exactly, reminds me of Chiu Chow Braise.
Not my favourite at that price point.

{"text":"Newland BBQ Square, a Northern Chinese Restaurant  having a Grand Opening Specials.  

Lunch is 50% off Noodles, Rice, Dim Sum and Appetizers... So this review written by me is naturally based on their lunch specials!!

Newland BBQ Square's Chinese name is really Newland Sea Cucumber Restaurant.  So I guess they must be specialized in sea cucumber. The menu is really interesting though with Seafood, Northern BBQ, Hot Pot, etc!

Walking in to the restaurant, I saw some water tanks that has fresh oysters, sea eels and other live seafood... but today I am going for the lunch specials!! 

Great Selections, all written in Chinese but their main menu does have English \"Subtitles\" you can refer to that by the corresponding numbers:

Mixed Sea Cucumber & Cucumber ($4.49)
- Really sea cucumber mixed with celery and parsley
- Sea cucumber does not look so appealing as a whole or when it is alive... 

Steamed Meat Bun ($2.99)
- The skin was a little thick...... not too much soup inside

Lan Zhou Stretched Noodle ($3.99)
- Noodles was nicely cooked with nice bite
- Soup based is clear.. not as flavoured as Vietnamese soup based, has a more tangy and spiciness to it
- Just a few piece of beef floating in this big bowl of soup with green onion, parsley and white radish as garnish.

Black Bean Sauce with Pork Noodle ($2.99)
- I don't really enjoy it as much because I found the sauce a little heavy and saucy... but some chili oil fixed that problem
- The noodle though has great bite!

I think the 50% off is great value when come during lunch. I will definitely be back for that again.

For dinner, everything is 10% off.

The decor is a little strange as this location used to be a Western Seafood restaurant. They do have 2 private room with Karaoke set up if you want to eat your sea cucumber and sing at the same time!!"}
