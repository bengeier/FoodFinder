{"text":"Update, breakfast and lunch again. Great service from Patrick and amazing meals. Honey chicken sandwich and the migras breakfast wont disappoint. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Great food! The staff was awesome too. After breakfast the waitress and gold pro set my 7-year-old son up with golf clubs and balls so he could enjoy the practice green."}
{"text":"Staying at the Sheraton and came here for breakfast.  Staff was very friendly and the food was great!  Had the Huevos Sivlik - eggs, shaved ribeye, green chilies, cheese on fry bread.  Really good!  We are going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite breakfast place. Right on a golf course in this beautiful resort. I can't find a better place where you have great food and great service and walk out spending $25 for 2 people. Awesome."}
{"text":"Call me picky but I don't eat flesh. This place screwed my order up twice but my waiter was nice so I payed double and walked out. I don't like sending something back to the kitchen twice, so I didn't. I don't like complaining either. I dont ever try to get comped on things when they dont go my way because i think it makes a person look like a total d-bag. Im not a golf snob either and i've even been a server before. I had simple requests here and they could not fulfill them. Don't put \"beans\" on the menu as an ingredient in a dish if the \"beans\" are actually beans with huge chunks of beef all up in them. Pretty simple. I'm not even a strict vegetarian so I'll eat eggs, but not if they are all gelatinous and undercooked. My meal was foul. Twice. Didn't eat it."}
