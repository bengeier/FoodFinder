{"text":"I'm no expert, but I've had this pizza 2 times at a birthday party at mini golf.  Both times the pizza was really good!  They have a crunchy crust and thick dough.  It reminds me of the homemade pizza the Italian ladies used to serve us at school once a week!  It is really good!  Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Love the garlic sour cream dipping sauce for jojos!

I usually order pizza chicken and jojos they have a special for $22 that is perfect to feed the entire family 

I've never had a problem with the staff they are always friendly. My order has been wrong once but they corrected it with no charge and seemed very apologetic."}
{"text":"Pizza was a little soggy and it wasn't really good. The fried chicken is good, but their jo jo's were hard and they don't give you many. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Terrible. I will never get this pizza again. I had heard good things about it, so I gave it a try. That was a mistake. I ordered extra sauce and there was not hardly any sauce at all. The toppings were very scarce & the crust was soggy. I just wasted  $20+."}
