{"text":"My hubby and I were craving some butter chicken and biryani, we usually go to a place on the south side near Mimico. But that day we decided, hey why not try something different? After getting a take out order here another time with my family, I remember being pretty impressed. So I went ahead and ordered our combo 1 meal. It came with chicken biryani, two side salads and a chicken korma, except we switched for butter chicken. 

I think remember calling around 5:20pm, and being told it would take about 20 minutes... Living about 20 minutes away we decided to make our way over... we got there around 5:50 when all was said and done...and when we got there, it's almost as if they totally forgot about our order. From the time we arrived, we maybe waited another 30 minutes for our meal. 

Now having not dined here before, I was never able to see what the inside of the restaurant. While the sign is pretty alluring from the outside, the inside is pretty underwhelming and in much need of an update. I also think they had just cleaned, and the restaurant was filled with the smell of dirty bleach water. Not appetizing. 

So low and behold, by 6:30 we finally got our food. I'm pretty sure they had forgotten, and got to making it right away when we got there. They used an excuse that they had just opened and were doing a major cleaning during the day - which in all honesty would have been fine, but I feel like they should have let us know on the phone when I originally ordered. Then we could of redirected our order somewhere else. 

Once we got home, we noticed we didn't get any of the combo sides, or the samosas we asked for as well. 

So will I order from here again? Probably not. And I certainly wouldn't dine here until they do a renovation.

Two stars because food is decent. Everything else needs improvement."}
{"text":"Great tasting Pakistani food! The combos were perfect for a large group of people. Nihari was amazing !! And so was the fry bhindi. Biryani and kebabs were very good too. I would love to come back to try other authentic dishes. The service was really good. We arrived at 11:15 although it closes at 11:30, but the owner served us and kept the restaurant open till we ate comfortably. Great experience"}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is friendly. But they need to work on there d√©cor.. A lot of work."}
{"text":"So ... My family and I were craving some butter chicken and samosas and we didn't want to go to our usual place up by Britannia and Creditview so, we searched and stumbled across this place.

PRICE
Reasonable and some really good valued lunch deals.  We got butter chicken at 8.99, two orders of veggie samosas 3 for 3.99, chicken briyani 5.99, an order of seasame naan and regular naan, all came out to $26.  Lunch specials are $9.99 includes rice, main and naan.  

SERVICE
Two thumbs up.  The cashier was nice, friendly and quick to serve us.  The kitchen chef also came out to the front to give us our order and asked if we needed anything else.  The restaurant was a good size with plenty of seating and booths.

TASTE
Of the two naans, seasame was my favourite because I love the toasty smell.  The regular naan was also a winner for my family members.  Chicken briyani was delicious with nice big pieces of chicken and the serving size was plentiful.  Butter chicken tasted exactly the way it should, creamy and savoury.   Veggie samosas were good, the wrapper was a less traditional type thinner.  The filling of the samosas was tasty and not as spicy as I usually have them.  Overall, good eats and I would return."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time.
Placed the order and the food came out 50 minutes late and that too after asking for it 3 times. Throughout they kept saying it is almost ready.
The chicken Karahi was good
The nihari was not good. 

For the ambiance, level of service and quality of food, I think it was over priced

Will I go there again? Most likely NOT"}
