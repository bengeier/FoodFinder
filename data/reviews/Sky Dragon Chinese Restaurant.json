{"text":"Where can you find $2.00 a dish dim sum anymore? The quality is good for the price you're paying. I went to a dim sum place and paid 3 times that price for a mediocre meal. This isn't a gourmet place like the ones in Markham and Richmond Hill but its perfect for the downtown dwellers.   The ladies pushing the carts are nice - the wait staff are super busy so sometimes you have to remind them of your requests.   If the dim sum dish you are craving has not come around after a few carts have passed,  you can order the dish through the wait staff who will put the order into the kitchen - nice and fresh!  Stars taken away for ambiance and decor - need a major update. Food presentation can be improved as well, but all in all, it's $2 a dish! Take some to go for a nice easy dinner!  Random comment - Elevator is a bit sketchy - if you're not afraid of heights, take the stairs - the elevator takes a while to get there and you'd want to let the elderly on first anyhow, leaving you to wait for it to come back again."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is good.  But horrible service.    I wanted to order take out while I ate there with my friends.  And the waiter told me \"you get yourself, we to busy\"..... WTF. Lazy Ass. Then when we paid our bill, he stood there 1ft away from us like a vulture.  Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Nope! Just Nope!  My experience at Sky Dragon was very uninspiring, and lacklustre. We ordered the chicken rolls and got MUSH! We ordered fried meat buns and got a lukewarm oil saturated version of the sort. I was definitely not impressed by the service and staff. I will not be a returning customer nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone!  BLEH"}
{"text":"Seriously, in terms of taste, this is possibly the worst dim-sum place I've ever gone to.  Sky Dragon was the first dim-sum restaurant I essayed in Chinatown, and even a year ago I had moved on quickly to other candidates.  I just gave it another chance this past week, because my regular dim-sum place Noble Seafood was blocked off due to a fire nearby.  I was shocked to find that my memory of the food at Sky Dragon wasn't accurate.  The food isn't just mediocre -- it's bad.  Because I was very hungry, I ordered a bit too much on this trip.  The shrimp wrapped in rice noodles was unremarkable but acceptable.  The tofu wraps, my favourite dish at Noble, were bunched up unattractively, but at least the contents were okay.  The pork dumplings (\"siu mai\") seemed overly dense and a workout on the teeth, which is not how this dish was supposed to be.  I had ordered the beef tripe and the chicken talons here before and both are embarrassing, flavourless and tough, so I didn't have to try them again this time.  The custard buns had too little filling and the buns were so thick that they fill you up in no time -- it feels like eating a plain Chinese bun.  The real disgrace is the glutinous rice with salted meat.  First of all, you only see two pieces of meat on the top, but in this dish, lack of substance can be compensated for by flavour.  Well, forget it.  The rice tasted like it's been left out overnight, and my jaw hurt from trying to chew it, and the whole thing was too dry, with not enough sauce.  This is probably the last chance I'll give to Sky Dragon.  It's not particularly convenient, since it's located at the top of a mall, four floors up.  The only positives are that I've received pretty decent service here in the few times I've gone, and even then, because of the size of the dining room, the food carts can often take a very long time to get to your area, and you end up having to chase them all over the room."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a random older Chinese woman we had asked for recommendations.  It looked promising at first, plastic table cloths + a bunch of older Chinese patrons.  Numerous carts offering various things.  Sorely disappointed.  Dishes were lukewarm at best and the items that should have been somewhat piping hot because they were fried were the coolest and seemed as if they had been sitting out for hours.  The only positive things I can say is that the service was friendly and they also took American dollars."}
{"text":"Dirty, greedy and rude!   Tableware is unbelievable dirty! Looks like easily hundred years old. There are even some leftovers on the surface, eek...  And the price goes up like crazy within just two months, they try to do any tricky thing to earn more money, for some items, they even change the price from S to M, that means from $2.1 to $3.6!!(no kidding), and only few S left!   The waiter doesn't care who you are, acts like your master, just throw your dish on the table, and if you ask them to change dirty tableware, they mumble a lot, and try to convince you not to change, so rude.  I defenite not going back to there again, ever! Unless over my dead body!"}
{"text":"The Sky Dragon always makes me laugh. I don't know if it's the ladies with the carts that manage to miss each other or the fact that this place is super packed ALL of the time!   It sounds like I'm not a fan but I am, don't get me wrong. I think that Dim Sum is meant to be a chaotic experience. The clinking of the dishes, the servers yelling their offerings, the many different smells. This sums up Sky Dragon.   The food is good and they have $2 plates during the week and lunch. I usually go with a group of people because I'm a crappy Dim Sum partner only eating the veggie & shrimp options. I LOVE me some Hargow!  It's also worth mentioning that there is always a table available, they seat you quickly & it is possible to be in & out in less than 60 mins OR you can take your time and see what wheels by.  **if you do go to Sky Dragon, expect a crazy time & embrace it, it's all part if the Dim Sum experience :) **"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday. The food was horrible. The taste and the presentation way to far off. The waiters and waitress couldn't speak English at all. The place was smelly something weird welcomed us when we were arrived. It has a bad odour. I was totally disappointed. I'd rather spent an extra $ 5-7 more and would've a good food and service. Won't come back there anymore."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at sky dragon. The price is right and the food hasn't disappointed me yet. The service is hit or miss, but it's usually really busy when I go between 11am and 1pm typically. Most of the staff look overwhelmed but the dim sum that I have come to enjoy (and stick to) are good. I give this restaurant an average rating but I feel it offers better dimsum than some of the other restaurants in the vicinity."}
{"text":"The Sky Dragon proved to be a delicious venue, with many different choices from other dim sum restaurants we've been to. Try the green beans - fantastic!!  I can personally vouch for the nummy dessert offerings! With full tummies we clocked in at $12.50 each.  Visited: March 16, 2014  UPDATE: Well, we revisited this restaurant with our monthly dim sum group and... the reviews were lukewarm, much like the food they served. It is a cart style resto and we found that by the time stuff came to us - even though we were near the kitchen - in many cases it was tepid and that directly impacted the flavour. The squid was so chewy as to be almost inedible. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and only one or two dishes were rated good (one was the desserts). However, given all the great dim sum places we've tried - many in the downtown area - this place was ruled a no-repeat. At $18/person it was way overpriced for what we got.  Visited: September 20, 2015"}
{"text":"Went here for a Chinese new year shindig.We had a ten course meal with all the fixin's and it was okay. I can' t say that there was any particular dish that stood out as being anything but average. I have to give them kudos for their efficiency and well organized service. We had a very large group and they handled it very smoothly."}
{"text":"Had Dim Sum there on Saturday November 23, 2013.  Not bad, not great, but somewhere in between.  We got there just after 10:30 a.m. and were surprised that is was jammed with people.  Then we found out that it opens at 9:00 a.m. every day and until 11:30 a.m. on weekends and holidays all dishes of every size are just $2.30.  It's an even better deal on week days when all Dim Sum dishes are just $2 from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  Some dishes like the Har Gow and  Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles were okay, but did not have the sweet freshness that we'd experienced a couple of weeks earlier across the street at Noble Seafood.  The Curried Cuttlefish were quite soft and non-chewy which showed that they were fresh and steam cooked, but the dish did not have a proper amount of curry.  For seafood Dim Sum we'd probably prefer going over to Noble.  The Chau Siu Bau (BBQ Pork Bun) was quite good with an ample amount of well cooked pork in a moist bun.  The the Do Fu Fah desert was hot and delicious.  The Eggplant with fish paste, Tofu with fishpaste and Fried Turnip cakes were all pretty good, light and tasty and not at all greasy like I might have expected from some other recent reviews.  The most fried dish we had was the Onion pizza with is basically fried dough with lots of chopped green onions inside of it.  They obviously made sure to clean the grease off before serving it because it was tasty, but didn't feel or taste oily, which I would have expected when it was as hot and fresh as it was when it came to us.   Whenever we hadn't seen something from the ladies with the carts, we simply asked one of the younger girls there and she quickly dashed off to get it and bring it back to our table.  They were terrific, so I don't know why I keep reading about lousy service unless they're new hires.  $25 (including tax) for 2 very full people was a great price for an acceptable if not great Dim Sum."}
{"text":"The dim sum price is cheap...Most times the items are cold but the place is really busy...It's good if you want dim sum and don't want to spend too much...The hot chili oil suck and you have to ask for it, when the waiters bring you steamed rice they almost always have their fingers near the rice, it's gross !!!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing comparing to other restaurants.  This the only one of large Chinese restaurants still standing in Chinatown. The service is not that great. Food taste bland and the dim sum size is small compare to other places. Price is ok."}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointing, and we weren't even on the lookout for high-end eats. (i.e., we were planning to hit Bright Pearl, which has always been a reasonably solid \"okay\", but it was closed for renovations.)  I don't know what else to say except that the selection wasn't the greatest, nothing was really hot, and the food was all just below mediocre.   That's what I get for insisting on the fun of cart service. Shoulda gone to Rol San or King's Noodle, both of which do good, hot & fresh off-the-menu dim sum.  On the upside, lunch only cost $15 for two people. (Mind you, we were two people who weren't thrilled with the food we actually ordered, so we cut our losses and left after having a few standard issue items.)"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   Yeh, you're at a big round table and waiters come around with carts. You point at something, and they either mumble something in Chinese, or open the little basket to reveal: something. If you're not used to dim sum, my recommendation is to go for it and worry about it later.  Oh yes, it's dim sum. Steamed dumplings filled with shrimp, or, whatever that pink stuff once was, are common, but so are nice treats like shanghai steamed buns, rice noodle rolls, or \"Phoenix claws!\" Look out for the wretched lo mai gai (leaf-wrapped dishes that really need care in order to be edible) and the cha siu sou (sweet dim sum, that really should only be served as dessert.) Look out, and avoid.  The nice thing is that most small dishes cost $2, so if you grab wrong, it's not such a bad experience for the wallet. The not-nice thing is that most of the dishes here are tasteless, stale, bland, or fatty.  I think Sky Dragon is actually a 1 star restaurant, but I'm going to give it 2 stars because it's probably a place you should try if you (a) have never had this kind of cheap blue collar dim sum (b) have never been ignored by 11 different Chinese waiters or (c) want to try a lot of different \"ethnic\" foods and spend a little less than $10.  And don't be lazy: take the stairs.  2 stars"}
{"text":"If you go for there during lunch for there 2 dollar dishes its a great deal. For what you pay the food you get is good. One thing I didnt like was that the waitresses with the cart will come and try to give you whats not selling fast and try to put it on your table without asking. Hopefully they can fix that as it is pretty annoying."}
{"text":"Good: convenient location for all day dim still until 10pm. Four dim sum plates for $16 was a cheap price.  Bad: scary food. Deep fried taro and pork had pungent artificial chemical taste on the underside.  It tasted like  someone washed the pan in javex and didn't rinse it properly.  When I asked the server to try the piece on plate on the table (that was untouched by anyone) she looked awkward, turned around and walked off.  She charged us for the dish.  The hargow was dry instead of moist.  I'd send inspectors to this place if I knew how."}
{"text":"You know what?.....it's not that bad. I wouldn't vote this place to have the best dim sum in the GTA but if you want a quick and dirty (no pun intended) dim sum meal on the weekend this place will do the trick. The other option in Chinatown is Rol San but they don't have the carts so for newbies this place is much more worthwhile."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To dim sum place in Toronto, the hidden restaurant on top of the Dragon City Mall in the heart of Chinatown is so unique and has delicious dimsum.  What to expect -Dimsum is only during LUNCH, for dinner it becomes a full service restaurant.  -The dimsum comes around the LARGE restaurant in carts pushed by cute, elderly Chinese women who announce what they have, if you want it just stop them and they will mark your order card for later.  -Their tables are outfitted with PLASTIC table cloth, which is efficient for when you are done so that they just lift it and another party can eat there.  -Awesome place if you want to experience a traditional Dim Sum restaurant similar to those in Hong Kong.   What to eat -They have all the basic dim sum dishes, and all are very delicious and steaming hot when it comes to you. Pork SIu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Fried squid, tofu and the mango pudding are my personal favourites.  -They also have a regular menu during lunch which contains dishes that other Chinese restaurants will have, so if you're craving YUMMY dim sum and Fried rice, they WILL have both.  -Their Mango pudding is my favourite, no one else can create such a beautiful rendition of the dish, I promise!  -Don't be afraid to try the more exotic dishes."}
{"text":"We are visiting toronto for the first time and a waitress recommended this place. It feels like a local place - dim sum basics! Cart service was timely and good variety of dishes. They also were very friendly with us when we asked for dishes we didn't see. It was a great non-touristy stop!"}
{"text":"Nice place to gather a gang of friends for a weekend dimsum lunch. The place is large, food keeps coming continuously and the ambiance is quite noisy, making it a great spot for a large group to hang out."}
{"text":"Terrible service, but you will get chased down if you leave an accordingly low tip."}
{"text":"You know what the big thing going for this place is?  The lack of people shoving and cramming their way into a teensy tiny establishment, even if there is a back room (here's looking at you Rol San kid), and being able to be seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Even on a civic holiday. Perhaps this is in part due to the fact that it is hidden a few flights above the DQ on Spadina. I never knew it was there until my sister introduced me, and the space itself is pretty big, surprisingly.  True, the food itself is nothing memorable - shrimp har gow is a little too sticky, yes, atmosphere is bordering on not-in-a-good way tacky , and I did see repeat visits of the same cycle of food. However, when you're hungry and craving dim sum on the fly, what's it gonna be: waiting 45 minutes for a noisy 'shared' table, or sneaking into this place for a quick and calm dim sum meal?"}
{"text":"the dim sum was good, the service was fine. the price is really good if you eat there at there special price time."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for tasty dim sum for great value - you're looking at $20 tops with tip for pretty much all you can eat dim sum/noodles etc"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for many years and usually avoid Sky Dragon if at all possible as I find the food too salty and dim sum overcooked especially the dumplings.  It makes me wonder if they only use frozen as I never had a good food experience when I ate there.  Plus service is often slow and sometimes non-existent, so good luck in getting the server's attention.   Nevertheless, I was here last week with extended family (I didn't have the chance in convincing them to go elsewhere), I think they like Sky Dragon because of the location and fact their dim sum is one of the cheapest in the area.  I'm thinking it's cheap for a reason to draw in the crowds.  Place is a little dated and doesn't seem like much has changed since the last time I was there, so at least they're consistent. Still the same salty and overcooked food, plus the service is still non-existent.   Sky Dragon offered cart service for dim sum and the ladies pushing the carts looked like they were on a mission to hurry and sell all their food.  We had to call back a couple of them as they pushed their carts too quickly when passing our table.  We ordered most of the standard dim sum dishes and for four people the bill came to around $45. Therefore, one star for  being an inexpensive place and second star for convenient location at the corner of Dundas and Spadina.  There are many other better dim sum places in the area, so I suggest to skip this place and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, and I'd have to say it's okay. I wouldn't jump up and down and rave to friends about it, but it's a good deal. It's on the top floor of what I call the chinese Eatons centre at Dundas and Spadina.  It's really a place for dim-sum on the weekends, and they have some interesting dishes moving around on carts, not just the standard steamed everything in little baskets. It's definitely catering to a more chinese crowd with more visits from ladies with chicken's feet than shrimp dumplings.  The food isn't fantastic, but definitely better than boarderline. While it's chaotic, they do service you well. I'm sure I'll end up here again soon."}
{"text":"I went here for dim sum on a Friday where all the dishes are $2 Monday- Friday (except special orders).  Standard items were ordered, har cow (shrimp dumplings), shiu mai (pork dumplings), cheng fun (rice rolls with meat inside), chicken feet, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, spare ribs...  First be careful what you take from the cart.  We didn't realize the cart had gone around a couple of times already and our first few dishes were cold!  (One disadvantage of not being able to order from the menu is you know the item is fresh and hot from the stove.)  The shiu mai had orange food colouring to emulate fish roe that is typically on top of it.    I found the spare ribs bland and too fatty.  The sticky rice was a little dry like they had it in fridge and stuck it in the microwave.  Everything else was okay.  Service was okay with a waiter coming by to make sure our teapot was filled and if we wanted anything else.  We ordered some crab claws - this was a special order so it came to like $6 or $7 for 2.  The snow pea leaf dish was $6.  This would be a good place to take your friends who are unfamiliar with dim sum because half the fun is looking at what's inside those steam baskets...  Look at your bill - our waiter messed up the calculations in their favour.  (I've found this in many Asian restaurants where the totals are rounded up....)  I'm giving this place a 3 since I haven't been to that many dim sum places.  I was meaning to go to Dim Sum King but they weren't offering the $2 dish deal when I went."}
{"text":"Ladies with steam carts remind me of my many trips and dim sum experiences in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. The hargow and shumai are very good along with the steamed bean curd pork rolls. Very friendly staff, quick service, decor is a little outdated. Big tables, spacious restaurant, I never waited to be seated. Unbelievably low prices. I've had many Satisfying meals and they serve dim sum all day from 10am to 11pm. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sky Dragon is probably the most reliable of the Chinatown dim sum restaurants, and is always busy - especially on weekends. The service is sporadic and the staff aren't very friendly, but it gets the job done.  I don't speak Chinese, so it's always an interesting experience when ordering from the carts that pass by. Having said that, the servers can explain each dish to you if necessary.  Nothing fancy but a decent lunch option in Chinatown that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is the dim sum place (hardly ever dinner) place that my daughter and I always return to.  They have not cut back on staff since the start of the downwards spiral of the economy as some other places have seemed to have done.  The waiter/waitress/host/hostess are a little frazzled with the many requests they get from such a large place, but they have yet to ever forget a request from us.  There's a wide selection of dim sum and they have a nice back cooking table near the kitchen where they prepare certain delicacies fresh!  If you are too shy to walk up with your card, the servers walk around with trays of these items.  It's nice to have the option of a freshly cooked plate of greens to dip into their home-style dish of soy sauce and chili peppers.  If you are averse to cooled down foods which I've read on other posts, please note that you should not grab anything that is no longer steaming, nor should you pay attention to the lady pushing the cart by you for the 6th time with two plates on her trolley.  Once you become recognized as a frequent patron, you get special treatment.  My daughter always gets extra squid when we order it as take out.  Please note that you can order items from the wait staff if you've waited a bit and noticed it is not being pushed around.  I used to wait and wait until we were full from less interesting items as the steamed rice rolls with shrimp until we noticed other people had it brought over.  This sure helps!"}
{"text":"Good service from friendly accommodating staff, good food.  The view from the restaurant is of downtown Toronto so everything is in full view. Great sight and place to eat. It can do with some remodeling?"}
{"text":"The dim sum were big portions. We ordered 7 dishes and paid $27. However, the service is inconvenient sometime because some of their staffs speak Chinese only. They have table plastic cloths which is really uncomfortable and make me feel it is not clean. Their utensils is not in good conditions and not properly clean as well."}
{"text":"I've had better, a lot better. Nothing really stuck out to me as great. Even worse most items were cold or lukewarm. It's cheap so there's that. There's no shortage of good dim sum in Toronto though so why go here?"}
{"text":"Came here during the 2005 summer vacation. I remembered the restaurant I had dim sum had these Japanese ukiyo-e portraits of women, but I can't find that one on Yelp. The service was good. Mom paid the bill with US dollars. Left the restaurant and saw the trams clanking through the streets."}
{"text":"Excellent, delicious, reasonably-priced dim sum in Toronto!  I went with my family to this restaurant on a Thursday for dim sum at lunch. Even during a large snowstorm, there were many filled tables. Dim sum was plentiful and authentically served from push-carts around the restaurant. Quality of the food was very good (for example, \"har gow\" shrimp dumplings had a good amount and size of shrimp).  Variety of food was excellent (even during the snowstorm). Service was prompt and decor is nice. Price is very reasonable ($2 per item on weekdays).  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I checked this place out because they had carts, like dim sum is supposed to be. Got a spot far from where carts would pass by. I had to chase them. And what I found in those steamers was far below the average I have experienced so far-- I must have been in 30 dim sum places around North America now including San Francisco"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé sur les conseils de ma soeur qui vit dans la région. J'avais envie de retrouver le concept des dim sum que j'avais connu il y a quelques années en visite aux USA. Ce fut un plaisir donc d'aller manger dans ce lieu. En soi, le décor est un peu kitsch mais bon, je ne m'y rendais pas pour cela. Les plats sont bons et pas chers. Par contre, le service est plutôt moyen, peut-être aussi le fait d'y aller à 16h n'a pas vraiment aidé. Au final, c'est une adresse pas chère et plutôt bonne à conseiller mais pas forcément comme première approche des dim sum pour quelqu'un qui ne connaît pas."}
{"text":"Looking for a super good dim sum deal downtown?  This is the place to go.  My coworker introduced me to the dim sum at Sky Dragon where on the weekday, every dish is only $1.70 each (weekends, I think are $2.20 each).  We regularly take a trip up to Chinatown for a quick and filling lunch.  The room is always packed, but we have never had to wait for a table.    We have also found most of the staff to be quite helpful, which has not been my usual experience when going for dim sum in Chinatown.  The dim sum standards are usually in rotation on carts.  I often find myself ordering stuff off a passing cart before my butt hits the chair, and within minutes our table is brimming with shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, beef balls, noodles, steamed pork buns, potstickers...   They don't appear to refrigerate their pop, but a can always comes with a glass filled with ice.  It works for me, but it might not be so great for those who don't like ice in their drinks.  The bill has never gone over $10 a person.  It's a total deal and if seated by the windows facing Spadina, you get a great view of the city skyline, too."}
{"text":"very poor service, we keep asking for water but the server keep ignoring us, so we end up getting our own water from their counter, we also get our own soy sauce for dumpling. if only i can give zero star i will do so...."}
{"text":"I'm going to go against the grain here. I've been eating dim sum all my life, all over North American often with my Chinese family. (So yes, maybe this doesn't compare to Hong Kong dim sum, I'll let you know when I get there.)  Although this place isn't fancy at all, I'm usually satisfied. Unless you are there right at the end of their serving time, we almost always get fresh delicious food. I enjoy the cart service, and they have been really nice to me in the past when I can't find a dish I want on the carts, they will make it in the kitchen and bring it to me. (And I don't speak too much Chinese so that can be a feat.) The price is good (usually $10-15 per person for all we can stuff ourselves with).   If you think of it as a greasy spoon brunch with unlimited tea (which I do), instead of fine dining, then you'll find a great place, full of Chinese people enjoying yum cha.   Just don't go to the bathroom. Yuck. Ok, with all the tea you will drink you will probably have to go to the bathroom. Just consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"many, many years ago the restaurant that used to occupy the space of sky dragon was a venue for extravagant chinese wedding banquets and special meals with friends and relatives. it's almost sad to see how the decor and fixtures do not seem to have been kept up over time. wear and tear here plead for an injection of makeover magic, or at least some fresh paint and new carpet and maybe some new textiles for the curtains and seats, and and and... having said all of that, the dim sum is not awful. not at all. it's not great though. some of the best picks are those carried around on trays, rather than carted around. my personal favourites: steamed snow pea shoots. bland to some, but basic, fresh, and uncluttered by seasonings. i could eat two plates. i also like the lo mei guy (sticky rice and chicken wrapped and steamed in a lotus leaf), steamed curried cuttle fish, and the rice flour steamed pudding-like desserts. during dim sum, i do tend to prefer the steamed items since i feel they are lighter and easier to assess the quality of flavours and textures. they're more likely to be hot and fresh too, since cooled or re-heated steamed food leaves tell-tails signs. moreover, the logistics of carting food around a restaurant that size means many of the fried or cool items have been around the block. steamed items that i didn't quite like: the har gow dumpling wrappers are thick and sticky and the pork and veggies wrapped in bean curd and bathing in salty soupy sauce (done well, they don't need pork nor much salt/sauce). i also didn't enjoy the pan-friend rice rolls - they were dry, even for a dry-stirfry, the \"stuffed\" eggplant was really greasy (and i never eat the filling), and the soy-sauce egg noodles with bean sprouts were extremely salty (as though they swapped the proportions of the light and dark soy).  apart from that, i found the service to be good. the ladies pushing the dim sum carts around were patient with my non-chinese speaking friends. one of them had never been to dim sum, and is vegetarian. the host even checked to see if she'd found enough to eat. she balked and said yes. however, when i asked later if she enjoyed the experience, she said she wished for more veggie options. personally, leaning on the side of being an accidental vegetarian, i thought there was plenty of selection *if* one knows what to order and speaks up. this is chinese food now.  the bill was very reasonable and we ate a lot with a few of the \"large\" and \"special\" items on the tick-box tab.  i'd go back maybe once or twice a year. and a large part of that is due to transportation and friends in the downtown core (vs my preference for dim sum up north)"}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese restaurant that serves dim sum during lunch time. Nothing special about it. The food was ok. It was a hit and miss with many dishes. The restaurant is big so it can accommodate a lot people when needed. I will not go back again. There are so many restaurants around the area that are way better."}
{"text":"Tried this place this morning and I must say their food was pretty tasty and I would come again.  I was initially skeptical seeing it only had a 2.5 avg rating but to my surprise it was a lot better than expected.  I am giving this place 3 stars because their elevator was broken and we had to walk these narrow stairs 3+ levels up.  Also, because we sat \"inside\" and not \"outside/aisle\" (not in another room as I thought that was what she meant when the hostess asked if inside was ok) and as a result it was kind of hard to order our dim sum from the pushing carts.  Some items were already sold out by the time we got up and walked up to the carts to get them ourselves.  The one dish that stood the most out for me today was their veggies dish."}
{"text":"Decor is a little dated, and the restaurant is certainly past its glory days. That said, the staff are quirky but very friendly and many speak surprisingly good English for a Chinese restaurant.  The food itself has been pretty good! While not outstanding, the prices are very reasonable.  On weekdays and evenings in particular, the restaurant is pretty empty, but they're hopping on weekends during dim sum. It's currently our go-to place for cheap dim sum around Chinatown."}
{"text":"$2.70 for all dim sum.  Overall it was't too bad. For a low end dim sum restaurant it was pretty good. The dim sum sizes are fairly large and tasty."}
{"text":"Drove from Niagra Falls about 100 miles away to get a taste of Toronto Chinese food. Toronto Chinatown like this restaurant was a little less than I expected. The Chinatowns in other places like Montreal and Boston are better. The feel was more what I would expect in a 3rd world country and not a large metropolitan city like Toronto. a couple of the dishes were less than average and a couple of others were ones that I haven't had before, a pleasant surprise. A big turn off for me was the plastic sheets they use for table cloths. People were more than friendly and courteous. Clean and not crowded (table placement). Very inexpensive"}
{"text":"Back in the 90s and early 2000's, I used to really like Sky Dragon. For a while, it was my go-to Dim Sum place downtown. They have always had decent service and good prices and back in the day, the food was pretty good.  They also had one old serving woman who didn't know English but had the brightest smile that would light up the room every time we went.  Unfortunately, over time, the quality of the food slowly dropped and dropped. The food got greasier, not quite as fresh tasting, etc. I'm pretty shocked to see high ratings written up in 2016 so perhaps I should give them a shot again. I'm just doubtful that they have bounced back to their old glory or that they are comparable to a number of other Dim Sum places right in the area that are much better!  Just browse my reviews to find out the better alternatives. :)"}
{"text":"I love the old school cart service - which is probably why I love Sky Dragon so much. Is it the best dim sum I've ever had? No way - but there is just something about seeing your food before you order it, trying dishes you know nothing about for the first time, and getting excited when you see an old favourite come by. Their mango pudding though is fantastic, definitely one of the best I've had in Toronto. It is difficult sometimes to ask questions when the server does not speak English, but typically another server is able to translate for me. I usually eat until I am stuffed and then some, and the bill for 2 people is never more than $30, so it's definitely a good value.   I'm probably being a bit generous with my review, but there's just something about the experience here I really like that makes me overlook any flaws with the food and service."}
{"text":"I only go here once a year on New Year's Day. It's been an annual tradition for quite some time now. Bear in mind I am not the best judge of authentic Chinese food, but here are my thoughts.   The food itself is just OK. It seems a bit oilier than strictly necessary. There is a good variety of dishes in the dim sum service, though most things have shrimp, and I don't really like shrimp. Still, it's easy enough to pick out of most things. (And that is not their fault!)   The ladies who bring the carts of dim sum around are super nice and seem to want to feed you. It's really sweet. Sometimes it's hard to get something you want on a busy day, but they try to remember what you want and bring it around if they get it.   The surroundings are a bit out-of-date, but I don't find that to be much of an issue. It's comfortable enough.   Ultimately, I don't think I'd go here if I weren't meeting my friends for our annual outing."}
{"text":"Extremely subpar dim sum and dinner service. Having frequented the restaurant many times for early morning dim sum, to late night dinner, as well as traditional Chinese banquet, each experience has come short of my expectations and standards for Chinese food. The dim sum itself has standard portions, made of poor quality ingredients that do not typically taste fresh; particularly any dish containing beef or shrimp. It is evident that the food is prepared in large batches, without much quality control. For dinner set meals and entrees, portion sizes are smaller than you would expect; a set dinner serving twelve often does not feed the twelve sufficiently, and more dishes are required to sufficiently do so. Even as such, the live fish does not come out with a fresh taste; indicative of the dirty water the live fish swim in prior to being served, and as with the lobster. Luckily, the wait staff are apologetic and will return dishes to be recooked completely, should we have any complaints. That being said, the standard expectation of a meal should not be that food will be redone upon request, rather, done correctly the first time. Would definitely recommend far better choices in Chinatown, or up town in the GTA."}
{"text":"I've been searching for dim sum that reminds me of my childhood in Vancouver. This place is not it.   Pros: cart service; authentic looking place  Cons: The food. Thick cheung fun (rice rolls with shrimp). Grey-looking stewed meat (including chicken feet! How could you get chicken feet wrong?). Hard fried squid. Pasty sui mai.   Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and had one of their set menus for large groups. The moment I walked in, it felt like I traveled back into time to the 90s. The restaurant smelled like a moldy basement and didn't exactly give off the feeling that it was cleaned recently. I also felt that the chairs had fleas or something because my legs were itchy throughout the night.   Now onto the food...it wasn't good. It was almost inedible. There didn't seem to be any flavour other than salt. The ingredients also didn't seem very fresh. The Peking duck was soggy, the lobster had a very strong fishy flavour to it, the fish was over steamed and also had a strong fishy flavour. The dessert was inedible. It was so thickened with starch that it looked gluey.   I won't be coming here again. The thought of the damp basement smell already turns me off."}
{"text":"It was cheap, but mediocre. It gets more than a 1 because it has the traditional cart style that is so hard to find, but most of the dim sum dishes were badly done. As a person who grew up around dim sum, very disappointing.  The siu mai were more like hard, pork meatballs with a weird taste, chicken feet unappetizing, and we ordered vermicelli with eggplant and it was so horrible we couldn't even finish it. Although the special is $2.20 every weekday from 9-4 pm, it is really not worth going, I would rather try the other dim sum places in the area   As a side note, I am Cantonese, so the problem of people only speaking Canto was not an issue, although I could see other people having this difficulty"}
{"text":"One star because there was an earwig steamed onto the side of one of our buns. We flagged down a waiter and he just took the dish away without saying a word. Makes me wonder if it's a normal occurrence? Not coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. I asked for hot sauce four times to four different waitresses and it never came. Took 15 mins before anyone came by to give us our tea initially, and then another 15 mins for anyone to notice our teapot lid was open signalling we need a tea refill. Dim sum is not great and everything looks dirty (my spoon wasnt clean) and the serving trays and carts dont look clean. I dont know why it's always busy for dim sum and I dont why I keep coming back (i suppose for convenience when im already in chinatown and want dim sum) We were seated near the entrance and barely any carts came by - waited for chicken feet and shrimp rice rolls that never came."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place quite a bit during our visit.  Had some different dim sum, like the pea shoots.  Family place, quite reasonably priced.  We found the service attentive, albeit a bit of a language barrier, (which we count as a positive in any international restaurant).  Ordered 2 waters, received one.  Otherwise, nothing bad.  Family atmosphere, good food, friendly staff.  It's quite large, so I can understand depending where you are sitting, may be hard to get service.  We had no issue.  Manager, or owner,  as well as waitress came over several times to see if all was good.  If we lived here we would be regulars.  Bit surprised on the lower ratings, so I am rating based upon the fact we haven't tried the other dim sum places, but comparing to home."}
{"text":"This long time dim sum restaurant is a favourite amongst the grandpas and grandmas who like to spend their leisure time here. This is also quite popular with tourists too. I only come here whenever we are too lazy to go uptown. One thing I like is that they still push carts which is quite rare nowadays. Anyways, food is cheap and alright to satisfy a craving so I'll keep coming back.   And shout out to the cart pushing lady today who overheard that I wanted egg tarts and personally brought one out from the kitchen to our table. 5 stars for her!  PS I saw one of the manager clean the lazy Susan table with tea and wiped it with the tablecloth ...that's Chinese people for ya!"}
{"text":"What are people looking for in a dim sum 'experience'?  I think Sky Dragon delivers.  It is kitschy, with plastic table cloths and plastic art.    That is what I expect.    The food is good enough and I always leave satisfied - not the best for 'foodies', but, again, what I expect.  This is not a high-end experience, but, it certainly is lively, and feels like I am actually in China with the carts and activity."}
{"text":"I'm not knowledgeable enough to be hyper-critical, but my wife and I enjoyed the dim sum here. Atmosphere was lively, if a little dingy and dated. But it's an airy space with a phenomenal view.  The ladies were great about making the rounds and coming back to us if we mentioned something that they ran out of. The food wasn't remarkable, but it was solid and there was a steep pre-11:30 a.m. discount on the Sunday morning we visited. So it seemed like the meal was a huge bargain - under $30 for tea and way too much food."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum while we were in town for the weekend. I can't speak for their regular dishes, but the dimsum dishes here are definitely some of the best dimsum dishes I've had.  I love Dimsum as I can try as many dishes as possible. I also love being able to see the dishes before ordering them. I am probably the worst companion for dimsum as I am mostly focused on the passing food trolleys rather than paying attention to  anyone else at the table.   We decided to come here due to a recommendation from a local friend. When we got to the restaurant just before noon, the main dining room was already full and we were relegated to the annex dining room. I was worried that we won't get as many carts coming through our small area.  But I was glad that my prediction was wrong. There were plenty of food carts that passed through our table. The service here is also pretty friendly, much nicer than the ones in Chinatown Manhattan or Flushing.  I also feel like there were more varieties of dishes here compare to the dimsum places in NY.    Now to the food, we ordered 8 dishes for the two of us. My favorite dishes were the crab puff, the wonton soup and the beef rice roll.  I rarely eat chicken feet, not out of disgust, but just out of laziness, there are way too many bones to deal with. However, the chicken feet here are pretty flavorful, I still don't like the bones, but I gave it a chance. The fried shrimp rolls were also above average. On the downside, the rice roll with fried crullers were terrible, as the fried crullers were soggy and not chewy as it should be. The Malay sponge cake was too dense and not airy.   I was surprised that they offered Tieguanyin tea as most places in Flushing don't offer it. The tea was pretty good, and they were quick to refill the water. Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised by the bill, we would have to be more than double of that in NY for the amount of dishes we ordered. Great dimsum experience, would come back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"3.5 $2 per dish m-f  $2.30 sat/sun per dish  According to yelp, all the dim sum places in the area weren't too impressive so thats why I chose to come here. Cheap but average quality dim sum. This place is located on the very top floor of the shopping center. Service was above average and the variety was good. The carts came by often and the food was hot. Not the best dim sum I have ever eaten but its a good value and I was quite satisfied. I recommend getting the beef or shrimp rice noodle rolls, tripe, meatballs, and shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"I came here today for happy hour dim sum,  or you can also call it early bird dim sum. On Sat, Sun and hoildays the early bird / happy hour dim sum is from 9:00 am to 11:30 am. I have to say although the place is run down and dingy, there us a lot if dim sum choices. They still use the old style pushing the carts around for dim sum. The prices are cheap! Overall, I would come back for early bird dim sum."}
{"text":"I can't think of any reason why I shouldn't give this place a 5 star.  I went here on a Saturday evening around 5pm.The restaurant is located on the top floor of Dragon city mall.Don't expect this place to be super fancy, the elevator to the restaurant is old and the restaurant itself is very old looking but it was clean and had a very calming vibe maybe because the restaurant was nearly empty.  I went here with my daughter and we were actually wanting to eat a mid day snack and thought of a dim sum date on a cold evening.  The ladies out there were super friendly and since it wasn't too busy we ended up chit chatting with a few.Service they gave us was beyond amazing.They kept checking on us and refilling our water.  So we ordered shrimp har gow, egg noodles, honey garlic ribs and shrimp and chive hockey pucks.The har gow was super fresh.The ribs were the highlight of the meal, they was so succulent and tasty wow.The eggs noodles were basic but added to the meal and last but not the least the hockey puck were delicious.All are food came out in timely manner and was super fresh and hot.  When here don't forget to ask for their hot sauce and chili oil both are the bomb.  All this we ordered came down to $24.I will definitely be coming here again.And I highly recommend this restaurant.Next time I want to try a few more things like crab claws and their mango pudding."}
{"text":"This is my typical Go-To Dim sum place.  It's not the best as far as quality in the city. But it's got the plastic table cloths and carts which is always a fun experience.  I take my friends here all the time. It gives them the opportunity to see and then try foods at a low price.  I've been here lots of times and I know what to expect in the food.    It's on the top floor of the mall.  The elevator is slow, sometimes it's better to take the stairs up an enjoy the scenic view through the dirty windows.  It can be rather hot and humid in the summers there.  The service is meh as with most low key asian places. They may not be super friendly but they do get the job done and that's all that really matters.  Depending on where you are seated, makes a difference on what you are able to be offered in terms of food. Sometimes the best dishes get taken up quickly and you'll see people taking the bill card and walk up to the carts to get served before the carts get to their tables.  This is quite common to see here.  So feel free to do the same.  Avoid the front window seating.  They are the last to get food.    The bathrooms are NOT great.  I'd advise going at home before you go there.  If you show up between Monday-Fridays from 9-4pm the dishes are $2.20 each. And on Saturday, Sunday and holidays between 9-11:30 am dishes are $2.50. Also the crab claws are NOT included on the special pricing.  Beware of other \"special\" dishes that this deal does not apply to - I think the green beans with minced meat is also a \"special\" dish.  If you are there during the cross over right after 11:30, then you will hear a loud musical tune that basically announces the changes in pricing.    Overall, it's a unique experience that amuses me each time I go. So I will always continue to go back."}
{"text":"My impatience got the better of me. On a recent cold afternoon in December when Banh Mi Boys was closed and we'd already been to Dumpling House and there was a small line for Rol San, we dashed across the street into a vertical 1980s shopping plaza and got exactly what we paid for: mediocre dim sum. Pressed for time and somewhat desperate for Hong Kong Tapas on Carts, we made the hasty decision of Sky Dragon...which wasn't terrible, but on the order of dim sum quality, was rather disappointing. The har gao and shaomai weren't bad but no char siu baau or sou??? Those are my faves. Also no deep fried taro. We waited and waited but to no avail. Overall, disappointing dim sum -- I've had much better."}
{"text":"We were waiting forever at rollsan and decided to trek a few meters down the street after a search because we were starving:  what a nice surprise!  Food is very good and service was friendly and they have carts!  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've never gone to a restaurant and wanted to go home right away to give it a negative review. It's actually not why I became a yelp reviewer. I mostly only choose to spend my time reviewing places to draw attention to good restaurants with good management practices.  Sky Dragon was the biggest disappointment in a dim sum restaurant - or any restaurant - for that matter.  I complained directly to management, so I feel validated now in writing this up as to why I think you can spend your money elsewhere.  1) the dim sum push cart food was not warm, not fresh, and tasted bland.  I didn't enjoy the dumplings, the noodle with shrimp roll, or the crab claws. And what is that pink water that they pass for sweet and sour sauce?  it was so gross, i pushed it away.    2) the service is pretty bad. we had to ask for water, soy sauce (why isn't it on the table), there wasn't any chilli oil, and the sauces in general were lacking quality.    3) the lack of variety of the food on the push carts.  we saw the same five variety of dim sum being peddled, and each rotation I could tell the food was getting even less fresh.  4) they changed the prices after we calculated our bill!  the low-priced items marked as $3.10 on the pre-marked tab got hand written and changed in dark ink pen to $3.50.  After I complained to the head front of the house manager, he said that they were using old tabs that reflected prices from months ago. and he was swift to show me the tabs of a nearby table whose prices were also just changed.  so, essentially what happened was that we ordered food based on one set of prices, and the prices got marked up post-check being requested. i didn't get an apology when this got pointed out.  5) cleanliness.  when they clear the tables, they just bunch up a sheet of giant white plastic and dump it in the kitchen with all the utensils and bowls in the wad. This is not only bad for the environment, but it's also just a reflection of the lack of attention to detail and Fordist machine line practices of the management and filtered down to the staff.  there was also lots of carpet stains, and litter on the floor.  I'm upset at my poor judgement for staying at this restaurant to the very end.  I should have walked far, far away once we got to the entrance but we were hungry.  After 15 minutes, we eat, and asked for the bill (with the prices changed on the spot).  I'm very disappointed in my experience, and don't want you to waste your time being curious that it's OK to eat somewhere with bad service, sanitation, etc.  Toronto is a city with so much good food, which wasn't to be found at this place."}
{"text":"Good dim sum. We arrived early on a Sunday and were happy to do so since it filled up fast.  Service was fine if you were willing to flag down what you wanted.  The dim sum quality was very good. It was very solid quality."}
{"text":"I love dim sum and have hit it up in as many cities as I can while on the road. I have eaten it in at least 4-5 different countries..   When I went in search of dim sum on friday morning while in Toronto, my friend suggested Noble. When we sat and found we had to order our dim sum from a menu, we were out the door with our group of seven looking for the more traditional serving of carts and punch cards. We found it a few blocks later with Sky Dragon.  The place was located on the top floor of the Dragon City Mall. Another in our group had been there and suggested it to us. So we took the leap of faith and went inside.   The decor was rather dated- i'd say circa 1980 by the couch that adorned the front area along with the mirrors there on the wall. The main part of the restaurant was nothing to get excited about.  Although the place was packed, they accomodated our large group immediately and within moments, we had about 15 plates stacked on our table. Two out of our group were dim sum virgins, and I was dealing with my veggie issue (it's a non issue really as I still eat shrimp or fish).   I was blown away by how many shrimp dumpling choices there were- even a shrimp and chives dumpling pan fried that reminded me closely of a potsticker which is one of the choices I miss the most! Shrimp rolls, shrimp wonton soup, sesame balls, and more. I was not for want of items to eat. My friends dove into their char siu bao's and potstickers and various other delights.   We got the bill after it was totalled; it came to less than $70 before tip. What? We each put in $12 and called it a day! What an amazing price for how much food we had gotten. Their prices, while always affordable, change depending on the times of day you are there.  And, after this meal we so thoroughly enjoyed, we stepped out onto their balcony over looking the city and the CN tower for a bunch of photos; us being the tourists that we were. We loved it so much we went back again with a smaller group on sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cheap, and conveniently located on the corner of Dundas and Spadina. I have been a few times, but I don't know that I'd return.  The food didn't taste particularly fresh and it wasn't even served warm enough for my liking.  The decor is horrible. They have not updated, nor probably even cleaned, the place since God knows when. It's just seedy and uncomfortable.  Staff? meh. I don't feel guilty not tipping a lot.  Positive? It's big, and they have lots of big tables, so even if you're with a group, you shouldn't wait to get served.  I would recommend just having a non-dim-sum meal in Chinatown rather than eating here."}
{"text":"This is not high-end dim sum but the servers are courteous and quick, the price is right and the experience is top notch.  Go during happy hours and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for dim sum on Sunday as it was near the AGO.  Well all I can say was...we got NOODLE BLOCKED!  We kept seeing the lady with the noodle tray come around...but never close enough to our table.  We even yelled for the noodles..and asked 2 servers...but alas the noodles weren't our friends that day as we never got them.    It's a pretty big space on the top floor of the Dragon City Mall complex.  I've had better dim sum...although they had an oyster dish that was good and I did enjoy their pea shoots.  But other than that pretty average food.  The table clothes are all that dollar store cheap plastic so don't go here if you are trying to impress anyone.    On the plus side they did bring our bill when we asked super fast ;)"}
{"text":"So, ordinarily I really like dimsum and generally don't mind if service is slow (which it sort of was- thank goodness for carts) and I've been to a lot of dimsum places too (with varying degrees of tastiness).  Unfortunately, I draw the line of 'not going there again' at having BUGS IN MY FOOD.  It wasn't even like \"oh, there's just 1 small bug in my dimsum\" there was a whole family of moderately sized bugs in several of our steamed dishes. We complained to the staff there and then they didn't even apologize, saying that this was normal and that we should just deal with it. So, yeah. Probably not going there again with their colony of bugs in their steaming baskets."}
{"text":"Our group of 12 had high hopes for this place and we were absolutely starving when we came in. It was a Sunday afternoon when we came in for a late lunch or early dinner (depending on how you look at it). The restaurant is located at the very top of the building, and if you are not lucky enough to squeeze into the small and slow elevator, then you'll have to climb up 3 flights of stairs.   The lobby to the restaurant was not very clean. There was a bucket of dirty water next to the gumball machines that filled the whole area with bleach. The restaurant was pretty empty when we entered so we were seated rather quickly.   Our group ordered a mixture of foods from the kitchen and off the dim sum menu. We took a look at the dim sum and just thought the menu as a whole was very sparse compared to what we get back home.   From what I can remember, we ordered the crab and fishball soup, salt and pepper calamari, fried shrimp, beef with chinese broccoli & oyster sauce, bbq roasted duck and soy sauce chicken. The only thing that had the most flavor was the beef with broccoli. Everything else was either bland or too salty.  The calamari was the worse offender of all, it was bland and tasted like it had been cooked in month old grease. You know how fresh the oil is when there is a light shimmer to your food. Ours was caked in dark residue.  The only dim sum that I had a taste of us was the shrimp in rice noodle. It was also bland and the shrimp very small.   Service was not good. We would request something, for instance, napkins, and would be handed a single sheet. How in the world are 12 people supposed to share 1 napkin?? Water also took a very long time to be refilled. This again, despite the fact that there were only about 3 other tables in the restaurant with us.   Compared to the dim sum restaurants in GA and those in San Fran's chinatown, this is a no go for me."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife on a Saturday night. The Dumpling we asked were ok but they don't have a lot of options if you don't like \"intestines\".  The worst part came in the end as they refused me to use my credit card with tap, they only allow me with PIN as they said I could say I've never been there and fraud the restaurant!!! I'm never coming back!"}
{"text":"My first dim sum experience in the Tdot!  I was forewarned to not to expect much in comparison to Vancouver.  He said where we were going is  ok and el cheapo. Now all that is cool because, ya know, sometimes we asians have this knack for combining cheap with tasty goodness.  Well, I will admit,  he was right. I had no expectations beyond mediocre so how could I be disappointed? Good move on his part.    My favourite part of the whole experience was the carts! I love those things!  In Vancouver, you see that so rarely. You must order off the menu.  Boring! It is no fun for people like me who have no idea what those things are.  Plus, just the fun of picking from a cart.   For me that made the experience. The food, well, let`s say I would like to see what else is in the east!"}
{"text":"If you're from New York City like I am you definitely have experienced better Dim Sum than this. The food is alright, but if you're looking for some good Dim Sum, you should just pass on this place, and the the price for a small, medium, large, etc is expensive for their size. The waitress for my table was very unfriendly, she always seemed like she was in a rush to go somewhere else, just plan bad service. And the woman that goes around pushing the carts, most of them are rude too, they walk right pass your table without waiting to see if you want order one of the dim sums that their serving. Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for a Wednesday lunch with some friends.  Restaurant was about 70% full and they had push cart service.  We asked if we can order off a sheet but they said we had to order from the carts.  Wasn't much variety of dim sums on the carts.  We had to ask the waitress for some items because the carts didn't have them.  Dim sums that were good were the har gows, fried squid tentacles, noodles, and the beef balls.  Dim sums you should avoid are the siu mai, pan fried sticky rice and steamed beef ribs.  Dim sums that are S/M/L were all $2.70.  In the end we ordered 16 dishes so total cost with tea ($1 per person) and tax was $53 for 5 people.  Pretty good deal if you want average dim sum at a cheap price with push cart service."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here Sept. 16, 2017 in the late afternoon - Toronto traffic, pededstrian, bicycle and vehicle is getting worse every year I visit.  So I was happy to find underground parking - we were able to take the elevator straight to the restaurant.  Reading another reviewer mention the elevator was broken made me wonder why they wouldn't have two.  Or did they?  I don't remember.    Well, to the review.....the place is not dirty by any means, but it could use a little \"dusting around the edges.\"  I did not see plastic table covers anywhere - I wish they had them - it was hard not to drip a little on the table cloth.  The food and service were excellent.  I especially liked the ribs.  Which were very small pieces, a little chewy, but wonderful flavor.  The sticky rice, sesame balls, and everything else we ordered was great, including tea it was only $30 CDN.  My only complaint is the chairs were old, and the padding was totally compressed. The seats were hard, like sitting on a piece of wood.  I would recommend bringing a seat cushion!  The funny thing, I mentioned this three times, they pretended not to hear me as I got no response. They heard me when I asked for more water, or mentioned the food was really good!  I suppose I shouldn't complain to have food that good, for such a reasonable price and a spectacular view of Toronto since this restaurant is on the top floor. **  Update - I have been there twice more since Sept. 2017.  The food is consistently good, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"First time going for dim sum.   Service was alright. Most of the waiters were nice enough to tell us what was on their carts minus this one waiter that keep yelling at us in Cantonese and clearly we didn't understand a single word. The food was really good, everything came piping hot but if you're planning to get good seats...get there before 12PM.  Recommended: Pan-Fried Octopus Fingers, Veggie Spring Rolls, Tempura Shrimp, Har Gow, Siu Mai and Shrimp Dumplings."}
{"text":"Eh - my first dimsum experience in Toronto Chinatown.  Place is cheap and it's a decent view being on the 4th floor - but why was everything so salty?  It seems very, very Westernized."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto and had just a couple of hours to spend.  We randomly picked a Chinese restaurant serving dimsum and took our chances.  This place was just ok.  Not much food coming around on a Friday morning at around noon time.  It took awhile for the 'churn fun' to come out.  The specialty foods section was lacking (the pork blood supply was low so I didn't want to have what was left at the bottom).    We ended up eating shiu mai, ha gao, ha churn, nai-wong bao and ngow lam (beef belly...i think) - sorry non Cantonese people.  I go by the Cantonese term.  The rest of you will have to do your research or just not go to dimsum (fine by me since I'll get my table faster!)  Then again, this place is probably a pass for most.  I'm sure there's bigger and better in Toronto"}
{"text":"A big thumbs down for this place!  This place is completely awful. The dim sum is pushed around in carts that don't keep them hot and you know how bad dim sum is when it's served cold. In addition, the dim sum is not prepared and cooked properly. I got a beef dish that was not suppose to have a hint of shrimp taste but did, which lead me to believe they they steam multiple dishes on the same plate. Not good!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE (I'll explain):  We were new to the Toronto area and we wanted to have dim sum. We randomly picked this place because we saw the signs that said daily dim sum (we should've checked Yelp prior but we were really hungry). We walked in and were immediately seated. The dining area looks like it's dated from the 80s like we were in North Korea.  Service was too slow, the waiters/waitresses didn't look happy and it felt like they were working against their will. They were so slow in bringing out utensils/tea/drinks that we had to ask 5-6 times and the restaurant wasn't even busy! The food was okay, but I wouldn't write a book about it.  Come to getting ready to leave and pay we receive the bill. We were going to leave tip on the table after paying the bill but here's something I would never expect from the waitress: when she counted the money for the bill she looked directly at my face in a mean tone and demanded TIP! She literally said \"TIP!!!!.......TIP!!!!........TIP!!!.......\" holy **** who does she think I am as a customer to demand to my face that I give tip! This waitress did NOT deserve any tip whatsoever. I was going to leave a tip but after what she did I did not want to at all. But one of my friends insisted and gave her $2. Like holy moly so rude and unprofessional. After she took the $2 tip she took off and quickly said \"thank you, bye\". You either voluntarily give them tip or the tip is in the bill.  I only give tip for good service. I'm sorry but the way she acted was horrible. Please do not go here."}
{"text":"Contrary to the other reviewer, we enjoyed this place a good deal.  The dishes tasted very fresh to us, especially the shrimp ones.  The chicken wings were a standout and steamed pork buns had a much fluffier dough than the usual leaden ones.  The food was very hot and I remember having to wait for something to cool.  The cart ladies sing out their offerings like Cantonese street vendors, which can be a little disconcerting.  Bright, pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a long time! And it looks, feels the same. Maybe quieter being it is Good Friday.  The menu items look very standard. I would recommend the course for 3 people. Some soup, Steamed fish, lobster, chinese vegetable, and red bean dessert. Added to it a bean curd dish, which made it to a sumptuous meal, but nothing to rave home about."}
{"text":"I come to Sky Dragon frequently for dim sum.  Servers push their cart around the room to serve food.  The benefit of this is that you can physically see the food they offer, especially if you're not familiar with dim sum.  You can also order from the waitress any item that you do not see in the cart or if you're just impatient waiting for food.  I've tried almost every item on their dim sum cart.  The food is hit or miss - food can be hot and fresh or not warm at all.  I find that when there are a lot of people dining in, the food tend to be more fresh."}
{"text":"I usually eat dim sum here with my family on weekends before 11:30 am.  This is when all dishes are priced at one size, whereas all the other times, the dishes are priced at small, medium, large, etc.   We came here on Thanksgiving at around 10, and it was already packed.  We were seated immediately, but most of the tables were already full.  If you see a full restaurant, don't let that scare you away, because there is another seating area in the restaurant that you won't see when you first go in.  Dim sum is served from rolling carts.  It's great because you can see what you're ordering.  The only downside is that sometimes my favourite dishes won't come out for awhile, but you can request the wait staff to bring it out for you when it becomes available.  The food is not mind blowing, but it's decent, and the location is stellar.  A few of my favourites are: the shrimp dumplings, cha siu sou (roast pork puff pastry), squid tentacles, and shrimp rice noodle roll.   A bonus, is that that this place accepts credit and debit!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum ever especially for a weekday.. When we got there, food was fresh and tasty.. Always get a bang for your buck here.."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  Few things to note before you read my review: 1) My family is from Hong Kong and I have been there many many times so I have had my fair share of authentic dim sum 2) Currently I live in Vancouver, the city with a plethora of extremely high quality Hong Kong/Guangdong restaurants which rival even the authentic ones in Hong Kong 3) I understand that this is a budget restaurant but I have factored in the quality of the food, price, and service before giving it an overall rating  So first of all, I have to say that I was very impressed with the prices ($2 for practically everything) and we were very excited to try everything.  I came here with a few of my Japanese friends and they were also very excited because dim sum is very expensive in Japan. (I remember most dim sum meals were around $20 Canadian or so at a decent place)  The restaurant is fairly spacious but not too clean, and is situated in a very old part of Chinatown I believe.  The restaurant is also very traditional, as it had old Chinese ladies pushing around dim sum carts, yelling out the names of the items as they walked around.  We ended up with at least 20 dishes between the 5 of us and were extremely full by the end of the meal.    I would say that the dishes were made purely for quantity and not quality.  The skin of the dumplings were very thick and did not have much filling.  Of course, this was expected as everything was only $2.  Nothing was very memorable but I was very disappointed with the pan fried radish cake dish because it was very starchy and didn't really taste like much.    Anyways, I decided to break down the rating: Food: 2/5  Sub-par Value: 3.5/5  Affordable  Service: 2/5  Not very attentive staff who cannot speak English Total: 2.5/5  PS. Since the staff here can't really speak English so I had to order in Cantonese for everybody and somewhat translate the dishes into English/Japanese which was a bit troublesome.  Also, as mentioned in another review, the elevator IS extremely slow so we ended up walking up the stairs instead."}
{"text":"The dimsum here is alright. The taste is ok, but sometime cold due to trolley style dispense. The variety they offer seem limited. The wonderful ladies who push tend to be very nice, and try their best to convey the items they have despite language barrier. Restaurant layout is quite nice; typical Chinese restaurant layout, with nice embellishment. Conclusion: food wise - you get what you pay at most I suppose. Like the staff, meh about food."}
{"text":"I love the chaotic jumble of cart dim sum - it's always a roller coaster of emotion and drama: fighting for the attention of the har gow and dim sum cart lady whilst simultaneously struggling to avoid the gaze of the woeful lady pushing the blood tofu soup cart.   You'll definitely get better (and warmer) dim sum in Toronto (heck, probably even across the street) but nothing beats long dim sum brunches over plastic table cloths. Sky Dragon is located on the top floor of the weird strip mall building on the corner of Spadina and Dundas, with pleasantly large and grimy windows to see into the downtown area. The restaurant is pretty big, and will definitely seat quite a few, but on weekends there can still be a bit of a wait. When you enter, you can walk in either to the left or to the right - try to sit on the right side, because that's where the kitchen is. The carts are restocked and emerge from the kitchen, so you'll have first pick of the dim sum.  Their selection of dim sum is not overly impressive, but it's not lacking either. They have the usual fare of shao mai, barbequed meats, rice rolls, steam buns, and dumplings. I also saw a veggies cart, a cart of tofu soup and soymilk, and various congee and stew carts. Additionally, if you don't see something specific on a cart that you want, just flag a waitress down - chances are they can make it for you in the kitchen if it's not already on a cart.   The dim sum itself is fine - nothing too offensive, but also nothing to call home about. Their pork soup dumplings were surprisingly good, and so were the rice rolls wrapped over chinese doughnuts, which came with three different sauces. The barbequed pork (cha shao pork) was way too sweet. The shrimp har gao was the biggest disappointment - after eagerly waiting quite a while for the shao mai lady to get to our side of the restaurant, we were greeted with sad, cold tasteless little pink lumps, covered in a layer of grease as if it had broken out in a cold sweat on the cart ride here.   Definitely get points for the nostalgia and the carts. I would return again but I wouldn't rave about the quality of the food - dim sum isn't meant to be gourmet and Sky Dragon definitely isn't.  Last gripe - charging for tea? Seriously? That seemed a little cheap to us - like a restaurant charging for bread."}
{"text":"My boyfriend never had dim sum before and I wanted him to experience an authentic dim sum experience (with the pushing of the carts). My goal was to order all the exotic dishes (mainly beef tripes and chicken feet). Surprisingly, he really enjoyed the chicken feet! I have to say that they do it very well here because not all restaurants do them with such great flavours. He didn't love the beef tripes and although I did enjoy it, I have to say I've been to other restaurants that do it better than this place. Overall, I think our dim sum experience was great and for $2 a dish, it's definitely a cheap place to eat!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good but the service is honestly horrible. They do not come by your table unless you flag them down. Ordered two cokes and even till he end of our meal, they still never came. The ladies who push the cart are rude where they are racist. If the table is full Asian or full white then they will treat you really well. Otherwise don't even think about coming here."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and we went for the \"package\" dinner for 6 plus a few of our favorite Cantonese style dishes.   The food was pretty good and the waiting staff was attentive.   It was not a meal that you would tell everyone - but good enough to fill you up with good satisfaction."}
{"text":"So this is a tricky one.   It's a pretty standard dim sum place on Spadina.  Nothing dreadful (no visible rats), mostly decent food - served hot - once you learn how to manage the steam cart ladies.  Order from the cooking table to get awesome greens to have with the ginger garlic dipping sauce.  There is however one thing that makes it worth going to Sky Dragon above almost any other dim sum spot in Toronto.  The chance to have pork soup dumplings.  You know - the ones with the soup on the inside.   They don't always have them - and I'm not a regular enough customer to get them on demand (though they have made a couple of squid dishes for me on request) - but it is worth going just because they might have the soup dumplings.  Best I've ever had. Ever.    If the only thing they served was the soup dumplings, I'd probably rate the place higher.   The cart ladies trying to convince me that cool shrimp dumplings are the bomb take down the overall rating."}
{"text":"I use to come here as a child and would prefer to go to another dim sum joint, because they only entry way is up a flight of stairs or the really tiny elevator that is usually packed with seniors.  Guess what, this is probably my favorite dim sum restaurant to date.  Come here almost every Friday on my day off with my family to dine in. They made some changes to their tables and chairs with a slip on and with a table cloth to match.  I, personally prefer that they still have the push cart pushed by really nice vocal Chinese ladies delivering the dim sums. This is traditional dim sum while other establishments eliminated the push cart, therefore it's a guessing game if you are a Westernize and not familiar what you had before.  The dim sum is fresh and delicious, the size of the portion is pretty damn big. Would need a take out container if you accidentally ordered too much.  The waitress are attentive and will come grab your tea pot/refill and provide napkins/chopsticks or a fork lol.  The overall ambient of the restaurant is fair, plenty of windows for added sunlight and TV's for those who want to watch the news."}
{"text":"Came here for a dim sum lunch with some coworkers. It's nothing special, and doesn't really differentiate itself from the pack other than the fact they still wheel around carts. Prices are fair, selection is what you'd expect. Nothing noteworthy in a negative sense, but nothing impressive either."}
{"text":"It's a fantastic dim sum joint. It always makes me so happy. I don't know what's up with this poor rating."}
{"text":"Though the DIM SUM at Sky Dragon is tasty and prices competitive with other DIM SUM eateries in the area please be aware that this restaurant charges a 10-15% mandatory gratuity. I was reminded of this, after my meal, when a short waitress collected my bill payment and spoke to me in an angry manner -in Mandarin. I asked her English please. She said 10% tips so I pull change from my pocket. She grabbed $1.10 from my hand. The total was $19.70 for 6 items -$2.70 per dish +tea. With the additional money =$2.10 tip.  Normally I'm very generous when it comes to tipping (I always pay a minimum 3% tip for the excellent service at Canteen Restaurant in the same mall) but this Sky Dragon doesn't have good service with regards to the waitresses though the ladies pushing the carts are nice. I feel that the amount of tip is at the discretion of the Customer."}
{"text":"Went late night.  I forget where I read some reviews (google?) but this was easily the worst dim sum I have ever had.  some larger dumplings were luke warm.  The flour shells were very starchy.  short ribs were tough as leather.  Did not even care enough to brown the \"fried\" taro cakes.    I used to think that it was impossible to mess up dim sum.  I bet most of these restaurants just hit up dim sum that someone else makes.  Would not recommend Sky Dragon."}
{"text":"Had food from this restaurant delivered many times, taste is usually mediocre and forgettable (hence I kept ordering and regretting afterward).  Dim sum here taste like MSG and I had a mild reaction one time after eating those.  My recent order was Singapore Vermicelli, Spare Ribs, and Siu Mai. There were some shrimp tail pieces in the noodle. The Spare Ribs are full of bones and fat, more than the usual ratio other dim sum restaurants would serve.  As for the Siu Mai, it didn't come.  A Crab Meat and Minced Pork Egg Drop Soup arrived instead.  Not sure how the order could be so off, I still ate it anyway.  But I found a small piece of metal strip in the soup, probably from a scrubbing pad, it was quite disturbing.  If I wasn't paying attention and swallowed it, it could have cut up the inside of my mouth or throat.  I think this is the last straw for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of the recent Reddit AMA with with Gordon Ramsey. When asked what kind of food he doesn't eat, he snarkily replied, \"I eat everything, from tarantulas to beating cobra hearts, but I draw the line at overcooked food.. It's disgusting.\"  Well, let me put it to you: the food at this restaurant is not just overcooked though, it is over-seasoned, artificial as plastic, and vomit-inducing. It is a bastardized version of dim sum crossbred with frozen food from your local Metro. This restaurant is a place you would go once, return with a stomachache and swear to god you will never go again. The restaurant is dirty and oddly reminds me of an abandoned Soviet building. Even if paid to eat at this restaurant, I would never dine here again. Utterly and thoroughly disgusting.   This literally is where you draw the line. Too harsh?"}
{"text":"J'avais pas mangé depuis 13-15 heures, mal dormi pour ne pas dire pas dormi. J'avais vraiment stupidement faim et j'avais rendez-vous avec des amis, on a mangé là. Évidemment, comme gars de Montréal, je ne peux que comparé et je trouve que ça ressemble a Kam Fung. Les classiques qu'on retrouve toujours dans un Dim sum. Portions intéressante. Vraiment pas cher. Le genre qu'avec 15$ on est plein, plus capable de manger.  Bon service, très rapide, repasse souvent.  I hadn't eat in the last 13-15 hours, slept few hours, not to say almost none. I was ridiculously hungry and was due to meet some friend there. As a Montrealer I can only compare to here and it feel like Kam fung dim sum. There's the classics, 15 $, well fed, not able to eat anything else. Service is very fast, they come back often."}
{"text":"O.k, I am going against the grain here, as a Westerner, I am giving this place 4 stars. The decor is definitely older but has a true Hong Kong vibe to it, the restaurant itself is very clean, the prices reasonable, and I love the cart service, its almost like a buffet that comes directly to you. Most of the servers here do not speak English but they are very courteous and polite. If you have not experienced dim sum before this is a good place to start :)"}
{"text":"Actual rating is 3.5.   Had lunch here today and I enjoyed it.  We shared seven dishes and the grand total was $21.  That's pretty rad.  It was busy, and the carts were flying by, so everything was warm.  Nothing we had was particularly stellar, but as far as standard dim sum goes, it was decent.  One of the servers called us Gwai Lo which made me giggle.  The place could deffo use a face lift.  My eyes kept being drawn to the filthy carpet."}
{"text":"This was my one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. We should have left as soon as we saw the outdated and run down decor. We got three of the dimsum dishes which weren't great but the worst part was the bone fragments I bit down into in my sticky rice. Once may happen but not with every bite.  Needless to say we just left without finishing and went to Ol reliable ,Mother Dumplings."}
{"text":"Being Midwestern American - I was a little intimidated with the choice of restaurants in Chinatown. I liked the idea of eating at a restaurant that gave me a nice view of the city at night, so I took a chance on this place without ever reading a review!  IKR??  Kung Pao Chicken was very close to what you have back in the states... But in my friend's opinion better for it came with more vegetables.  Spice was perfect - complete with wonton soup and white rice!  Can't get any more \"American\" Chinese than that...HAHA!    I had the Dim Sum and found a nice variety at reasonable prices. My favorite was the custard dumplings... Good thing they came out first!  ;)   The staff was very friendly, and helped us with our food choices. They lose one star for making me sit at a folding table with banquet chairs... But all in all I'm glad I came!"}
{"text":"Came here for a private group function, both food and service was okay but the washroom only had one stall and it was disgusting."}
{"text":"When I was a little kid the family would eat at this upstairs location often.  I think it has changed names like 10 times over the years, but Sky Dragon is the latest incarnation.  It has been Sky Dragon for a while now, so I am sure it is due for a name change any moment now.  I have no idea why my family wanted to come here as the dim sum isn't that great.  I was told it was a convenient location with the people we were with. Shrug, I wasn't going to question it further.  Dead empty for a Sunday morning (another reason I'm expecting a name change) but it did pick up a little bit as we were leaving.  Took a while to get the carts rolling but once they started they were coming pretty frequently.  Good selection, but the food was as I remembered it so many years ago.  Not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum experiences I've had in the city.  The staff can be a bit gruff at times but then who wouldn't be from pushing around a food trolley all day.  I think the food is excellent.  Its a very busy place on weekends so if you have a large group you should make a reservation."}
{"text":"What a *roller coaster* ride of flavours and surprises!   We sat at a table by the rooftop, which was occupied by kids high on glucose spinning sticks around. A beautiful perspective of the skyline was on our left.  Old people were wandering around laughing, women in red uniforms and paper hats pushed carts by with all the morsels.   Best morsels: dumplings! Always dumplings. Delicious egg noodle stir fry, insane(!) tempura fried shrimp, etc.   Everything is basic and cheap and super greasy, which is cool with my crew pretty much all the time. I've never been to real dim sum with the carts and I thought it was an incredibly satisfying method of eating out. I would come again.  ;)"}
{"text":"Cheap and solid dim sum. The service is fast too. Quality isn't amazing and the place seems kind of dingy, but they have most of the standard dishes. Even though they had the normal cart pushing ladies, I ordered most of my shrimp noodles (ha cheung?) through the server and they were efficient. Overall a pretty good value!"}
{"text":"The dim sum here is okay, some dishes are under seasoned and overcooked. I mean, it's not the best dim sum, but it certainly is edible.  It's really cheap in the mornings too, just make sure you double check the bill calculations."}
{"text":"Traditional Hongkong style dim sum restaurant. Love their fresh and home made dim sum. They have the booth and small trolley"}
{"text":"Someone sucked all of the effort of Sky Dragon.  Seriously, I haven't seen a restaurant try less hard, in, well, ever. The tables are thrown together in spite of the carts that need to be pushed through. Service requires Chinese-style hailing down a waiter, which is awkward enough. The tea, usually a saving grace for Chinese restaurants, is pretty awful. Seems the leaves probably haven't been changed in a week. And don't get me started on the food.  I'd probably slap on two stars here and move on with my life, but to add insult to injury, they overcharged us for the meal. We got a waitress to do our math again, and she was much nicer than the first waiter, who couldn't have telegraphed how much he wanted to be elsewhere more. She confirmed his miscalculation (rampant rounding), but it's not really a comfort when he messed it up in the first place.  Eek! Methinks not indeed."}
{"text":"When you walk into this place, you feel like you've walked into a relic of the early 80s. Random decorations are strewn about outside the restaurant to enhance the retro look. This is definitely not somewhere where you want to take a date. Not to mention the restaurant was about 20% full on a Friday night. Yikes.  I had pretty low expectations at this point. Even then I was disappointed. Nothing about the food tasted authentic or even tasty at all. They even had shrimp tempura that you can get from any supermarket. Everything just either bland or bad. The night was topped off by the waiter bringing some steamed fish to us, cutting into it, gawking at it for a second and then quickly taking it back into the kitchen without saying a word. One of my friends noticed that the fish was still raw. They brought the fish back about 10 minutes later and appeared edible at that point.  All in all, this place needs some serious renovations, a recipe change, and some new chefs."}
{"text":"Sky Dragon was busy when I visited for lunch today. Although it was busy, the 5 of us were seated within 10 minutes. It's a little difficult to find this place. When you walk into the mini mall, immediately turn right and take the elevator up (or walk, because the small elevator gets packed!).  The push-cart dim sum was not that great, even for the low price ($2 per dish). They have the usual fare that they have at all other dim sum places. We had the radish cake, deep fried taro, shrimp/beef in rice rolls, shumai, shrimp dumplings, etc. I've had way better dim sum in the GTA (#GTARocks)."}
{"text":"Atrocious.  The food is good, but check your bill.  I noticed a huge discrepancy on my bill and brought it to their attention.  They adjusted it, but it was still incorrect, but still in their favor of course.  It is my opinion that the error was not accidental.  My eleven year old niece can add better."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that the food was amazingly tasty but it was more the sense of nostalgia that made me like Sky Dragon!    I came here on a weekday with my fiance and wowza!  I have not had dim sum at a place like this in ages!  Most Chinese restaurants have phased out carts (and ladies yelling dish names) and plastic tablecloths, but coming here brought back great memories!  Dishes were also $2 each, which is pretty much unheard of these days.  Wish we had come with more people to try more dishes - couldn't believe they still served pork blood and chives!  :P"}
{"text":"It's a decent place for dim sum in the downtown area. They still have the old school pushed carts with different dim sum options. Not too many dim sum places have the pushed carts anymore.  It's conveniently located at Chinatown center. You can park underground and take the elevator up to the top level. This is a nice bonus during cold months when you have to take grandparents out for dim sum.  Hygiene is a bit lacking here at times. Bathroom could use a bit more cleaning.  Dim sum items are discounted before 1130am everyday including weekend.  Overall: very cheap dim sum, good location, good service. Place is a bit dated and hygiene is a bit lacking at times. The grandparents seem to like it here so we keep coming back for dim sum"}
{"text":"Service:   a mix of friendly and rude.  We had 2 female sever and the dim sum ladies that were pleasant and friendly.  Then we had to deal with the rest of the staff that treated us like we were an inconvenient by trying to ask for water or pay our bill ( you're suppose to know  to take your own bill up the counter).   Atmosphere:   large restaurant on the 4th floor with a nice view of the skyline when you are at the front waiting to be seated.     Food:   Water glass had a nice red lipstick mark still on it, dim sum was bland and one of the dumpling came with a nice strand of hair. When I told one of the staff to tell the kitchen to be more careful the responds was \" thank you\" and walked away.    I would skip this place and go somewhere else if you're looking for dim sum when in Toronto.  We regret not doing the same."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here with my family, but it wasn't very pleasant. Although the service was fast, the dishware wasn't clean. Everything was going well until I found a hair in my shrimp rice noodle dim sum. I told my mother and she informed one of the waiters who informed someone else who seemed to be the manager. The manager then said that I was the one who placed the hair into the food. I really wonder how the food inspectors get past this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum but not comparable to Rol San. I really enjoy the cart style dim sum restaurants as you can look at what you are about to eat and it's just more fun. They had better shrimp and Chive dumplings than other places and they have good har gow. I did not order congee but it looked tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is not good compared to other places in the area (just go to Rosewood or Dim Sum King or Rol san) this place isn't worth it. The service is bad and the waitress chases you down for tips when it's undeserved?"}
{"text":"We go here for dimsum some weekends.. Always delicious! friendly staff! Take the stairs after you eat you will be full!"}
