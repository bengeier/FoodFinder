{"text":"Review is based primarily on the beer and atmosphere. This truly is one of the best places to enjoy quality beer in a really impressive outdoor environment within the city limits. I stuck to a liquid diet for the evening as consumption of fine beer was my #1 objective. I appreciate that OMB brews according to the 1516 Bavarian Law of Purity....Unfortunately, a thunderstorm came through so we went inside and the facility inside is also quite nice. Overall, a great place to enjoy quality beer."}
{"text":"After living in Germany for three years sometimes I'm in the mood for a beer garden. This place is pretty close. Good biergarten food and great beer! Check hours before you go because they're not open every day!"}
{"text":"Everything about this joint was just ok. There is a very limited menu consisting of appetizers, and a variety of both sandwiches and brautwurts (that's it). I tired the wurst sampler and each of the sausages were rather bland, only one had some real flavor. The beer is what this place is supposed to be about but I found both beers I had to not be very good.  I came in OMB looking for a burger a beer and to watch the game, with only one TV I only got one of those things.  Def wouldn't run back there for anything."}
{"text":"Great beer and pretty good food, but the service is seriously lacking (might just be the two particular waitresses we had).  We were expecting a much more interesting environment. Was full of drunk hipsters, which is funny too, but honestly, it was pretty boring. Not a real party environment or anything. Oh yeah, they close at ten."}
{"text":"Went to their grand opening at their new location. It is huge!!! They have a really big patio, grass area... So much land it's awesome to just go hang out with your friends. They have cornhole boards, and lots of picnic tables.... Great place for an event like wedding or birthday.  For the grand opening it was a little frustrating because they knew it was going to be crazy busy and they only had 2 bars open when I got there... Which for a brewery is kind of crazy. Seems like they would have a lot more open so it wouldn't take us about 30 mins for each drink. Also had to wait in line for 40 mins for good... But as I said it was their grand opening so I'm sure it won't be like that anymore.  I love their beer... And the place is very cool. You def have to go check it out, and pet friendly"}
{"text":"When trying to emulate a German beer garden, you need 2 things: a garden and beer.  This place has 1 of those.  The atmosphere is really on point.  I liked the communal tables, the outdoor area, and the big sprawling bar.  However, they had some of the worst beer I've ever had.  Tasting the Southside Weiss was a big disappointment.  None of the flavors I have come to love from a wheat beer.  Same with their Copper.  I enjoyed being there so much that I contemplated getting a second beer, but I couldn't, it was that bad.  Also, their method for food ordering is ridiculous.  We ordered some food at the bar, they told us to come back in 30 minutes.  After waiting, we went back and saw our food behind the bar.  15 minutes later we finally made it to the bar to request our said food, only to eat it ice cold.  It wasn't bad, but how can you screw up Currywurst?  It's ketchup and curry powder.  Come on OMB, learn how to make some decent beer.  Then maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"I lived in Germany for three years and this is as close to authentic as it gets.  Great beer... Copper is my favorite as it is similar to Dusseldorf Alt Beer.  The Wurst is likewise very good.  It is a fun setting and as warmer weather approaches, the outside Beer Garden will be a popular place to hang out."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place.  Waited over an hour, twelve crawfish for twelve dollars.  Being a true cajun, I expected more."}
{"text":"Wow. The new place has gone to a new level. More table servers better outside seating. Great atmosphere. The only thing I miss is seeing the brewery from the bar. Congrats on the new place OMB."}
{"text":"Olde Mecklenburg beer in the Dortmund-style takes some effort to warm up to. Sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a VERY harsh initial taste. German beer by it's nature typically mellows the Hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff. Rolled on a second Copper and it finally started to get a tad better. Their winter brew is simply awful. This is really not what a German beer is supposed to be doing to you.   Ordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun. Very sad to experience. Guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks.  Brewery itself is off in an industrial area very close to I-77. The tap room is done up nicely. Lots of wood and warmth but that only means you'll have to stay there and drink the product.  Lastly make sure you MapQuest this place out for your visit because it'll take at least three employees to direct you there.   Hopefully they'll replace the current brewmaster with someone that's had German beer before. May be just OK to pop in and check out quickly."}
{"text":"Love the beer the atmosphere and the tour was outstanding, featuring a guy who really knows his craft and his product. The Fat Boy porter is ridiculously great and there is no fresher product in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have excellent beer, great friendly staff and an amazing beer garden. They are expanding and have a great beer tour. I would definitely recommend going here. We go a lot!!"}
{"text":"My second home,  I owe on the mortgage lol.  The staff is amazing,  the food is bananas.  The beer....whew. I'm hooked!   I take friends there all of the time and look like a big shot. You should see this place. Especially if you cycle,  Sunday is your day."}
{"text":"The new place is great. Reminds of a German bierhaus. The beer is really good, love the cooper ale. Had the pretzle, very yummy though they need to work out the kinks when ordering outside when the food truck is closed. Live music was setting up when we had to leave. Cornhole games were in full swing. Can't wait to bring friends here."}
{"text":"Arriving just before 9:30 on a Monday night, our waitress was a doll. She got our order in to the kitchen before closing. Try the Teller with Bratwürst and Frankfurter with potato salad and Rotkohl. Such a fulfilling delight!  I love Mecklenburg Brewery!"}
{"text":"How is the beer, you ask? The award winning beer is great - you should try my favorite, the Copper, and if in season, the Mecktoberfest.  How is the food, you ask? The award winning beer is great!  Prosit!"}
{"text":"If you love german beer, this is your new favorite place.  It should be noted that this is a brewery not a bar, so the food selection is limited and if you don't like beer well you better like water or soda.  We came down last year while visiting friends and now it is a must do when we are in Charlotte. Great place to grab a few pints and then take some growlers home so you can continue to enjoy the deliciousness."}
{"text":"My experience here was horrible. We grabbed our dog and went for dinner only to find out that if you are seated outside (only place dogs are allowed) you can only order off the limited bar menu not real food.  We left without actually eating anything.  If you do go to this supposedly dog friendly place don't bring your dog or you won't get service."}
{"text":"If u want anything from the inside menu you have to stay inside. You can't get it and sit outside ND enjoy the weather or music!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to the brewery with friends and wondered why I had never been there before! The beer was awesome, and the bourbon beer was especially delicious. I went on a tour of the brewery (which is free!) with jimmy and it was great! He was so knowledgable and entertaining, and I was surprised about how much you actually get to see while on the tour. Great spot and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed all the bier at OMB. Great German style heritage brews. The food was good but no there's a no non-sense take on the service with paper plates & plastic cutlery. Little disappointed they didn't have soft pretzels, they were out of stock, on a early Saturday evening...   The one non-beer drinking guest in our party was also disappointed she was never offered the chance to have a glass of wine,which is available. We'll give it a second chance when it's convienient and"}
{"text":"The OMB brewery has a great set up with a new and large facility and a probably one of the largest and best outdoor patio areas for sitting out in the sun with a nice beer or pretzel. The food is ok here. Small appetizer foods like pretzels and brawts  are available outside with a larger menu available inside. The beer however is not my favorite among the micro brews around the Charlotte area. It was one of the first micro brews to pop up in the Charlotte area that paved the way for many others but since then I feel it has become a little commercial and reliant on their original recipes. If you are already a fan of their classic copper or dunkel beers or are there for the outdoor scenery then it's ok, but if you are looking for a really good micro brew style beer I'd recommend going to sugar creek brewery across the street. Not a bad spot though all in all."}
{"text":"Love this brewery. Beautiful outdoor area, huge inside and a private room for parties. The beer variety is wide and delish. Yummy menu items and plenty of room for kids or dogs (outside).   Private events have plenty of space and there is ample parking.   Come for Yoga on Tap and stay for a beer!"}
{"text":"Dear OMB,  The only reason I'm giving you 1 star is because you lock customers' cars in your parking lot once you are closed. Hey, it's your property, do what you want. But it would be nice if you had a sign posted right when we pulled in letting us know that that is your policy. I missed a very important appointment the next morning because I had to wait for you to open before being able to retrieve my car. That is not good customer service at all!  Sincerely, There are other breweries in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good beer. HORRIBLE service.  We waited for literally 2 hours to eat our food. I'm waiting for it still as I write this review. 4 other families who arrived after us have already received their food and left. Come for the beer, don't stay for the food. Here at 1:15pm it's 3:46pm. Finally, food has arrived at 3:49. Food tastes like it sat on the shelf for weeks."}
{"text":"Amazing. Go there. Enjoy the biergarten, the Bier, and the proper german-ness. Chelsea was fantastic."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night, very busy but quickly found a table. The server was a little too busy and forgot a number of things. My appetizer came at the same time as my entree. They were apologetic and took my app back. I had the German sausage with sauerkraut it was really good. I think this maybe a good thing we couldn't get drunk as the table service was slow, so only had one beer. I've heard it's fantastic in warmer weather to go outside."}
{"text":"We suggest having the Copper & a pretzel. We are thrilled to have OMB returning to our festival on 5/14/16. Join us at 308 W. Carson Blvd for unlimited beer tastings, live music & food trucks."}
{"text":"Gorgeous facility!!! We had a blast at the beer garden! Thank you for bringing this experience to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic environment.  The bratwurst were fantastic and even you do not like sauerkraut try it;  it is out standing.   Oh and the beer superb! !"}
{"text":"This place was huge! We went here on a Friday night which was busy and crowded. We sat next to another couple which was really friendly as we are newcomers in this town. The beer I got was good even though I'm not a huge beer drinker. The food was alright, wings surprisingly good for a Germain place. A downer for me is that there was no soap in the ladies restroom for hours. Later on someone put a thing of hand santizer, but still just not cool. The setting kind of feels like you're at a fair and I think would be more fun as a group outing instead of date night."}
{"text":"I was really upset with them. A few of us got there early and grab drinks at the bar and didn't get ID at the bar. After others came in we got a table ordered more drinks and never got ID they gave us the drinks. About 20 minutes after we sat down the waiter came over and asked for IDs. After my friend noticed she didn't have hers on her she told him and her boyfriend took her drink before she touched it and drank it himself. After that we tried calling the waiter over to order food and he kept ignoring us. Then he got his manger over to check again. And at that point he was checking mine and didn't give it back right away and started to ask me where I lived. I don't care that he did this. But the fight the waiter kept walking passed us and then told us that if we didn't lie about our age it wouldn't have been a problem. At that point we all got upset and asked who was lying about age. He then told us there was someone there that had told him. When we asked to know who told him that he got his manger. When his manger came over he told us that if we wanted to stay we weren't allowed to have anymore drinks. Upon that we asked for our checks and he told them we could order food Togo. After this I don't think I'll be going back. They were very rude to my friends and me."}
{"text":"German style beer hall and German style brewing. That nicely sums up OMB.   OMB makes several tasty varieties of german beers following the reinheitsgebot german purity laws. Though they are good at making the beers they make, their downfall will be sticking to the reinheitsgebot. Because they follow that, they have a small selection of beer compared to most micro breweries. That is disappointing because I believe they could have a pretty good lineup of beer if they expanded and only brewed their traditional german beers using the purity law.   I also took the tour while I was there and it was informative and entertaining. I tend to travel the world on brewery at a time and am becoming a tour snob. This one does not disappoint. They cover everything a good tour should cover, you get to enjoy beer while on the tour (though it is beer you buy from the beer garden) and the tour guide was entertaining."}
{"text":"My owner organized a little brew crawl on July 3rd for me and some friends.  Dogs are allowed in the biergarten.  The only problem is the biergarten has no 'garten'!  It's really just a concrete spot next to the parking lot with some picnic tables.  : (  The beer is fantastic, as are the various 'meats in casing' that they sell.  The pretzels could be awesome except they always seem to spend too much time in the microwave before making their way to the plate.  Even with umbrellas, it was way too hot for someone with tender paws and no shoes.  My owners were sweating up a storm (there are times i wish I could sweat, but alas I can only pant to cool off.)  We'll definitely go back, but only in another season!"}
{"text":"Olde Mack is the big brother of the Charlotte microbreweries and it shows.  They have a big operation, which lacks some of the home-town-ey-ness of some of its neighbors.  The beer lineup is very german, so you won't find a ton of west coast IPAs and the like.  The food lineup is similarly german; the sausages didn't have much pizzaz to them, but the soft pretzels were amazing."}
{"text":"Best beer in Charlotte - if not in the US! Being originally form Germany I can attest that this beer tastes just like it does in Germany. They're brewing the beer based on the German Beer Purity law from 1516 and their brewmaster is actually from a German brewery in Duesseldorf. If you like beer - you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly disappointed. For such a big name, I left feeling like they were missing the key elements that create that \"I'll have another\" atmosphere. Seems like a nice place for an event but not intimate enough for hanging out for a cold beer. If they could find a way to balance both it would nice. Also the beer was nothing to tell my friends about. There are so many avenues one could take to create a creative and unique menu/ menu display now a days and they just didn't cut It for the obvious amount of time and work that went into the design of the place. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I love omb! Great beers and it's the best place to bring friends when you want to hang out outside! I love their Southside Weiss and their caprese panini is perfect too! Don't forget to get some hummus and pretzels as appetizers!! I only wish they had music later!"}
{"text":"Found this place near my hotel. Thank god. It looked a bit simple from the outside, but very nice on the inside. I was lucky to tag along on a free tour of the brewery. Dennis? (Sorry if I forgot your name) gave a great enthusiastic tour. The beer was great. I've had many bourbon barrel aged beers and theirs was good. Fresh beer. Hope to visit again soon. Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here at this cool place in an upcoming area in Charlotte. Parking was free and a little odd layout in relation to the front door. But it's all good. Plenty of beer options and a very large out door dining area. We ate inside and without alcohol since it was lunch time. One guest ordered a burger, one ordered a salad and I ordered a club sandwich. Pretty standard food and had great flavor. Everyone was pleased. The staff was friendly. This seemed to be a popular place with younger folks. Very busy for after 3 pm. The rest rooms were nice and the prices we're good. Will return."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure once of meeting the Guru of Beer in Tibet and he only spoke one sentence to me: Seekith not that makes thee drunk but that which makes thee happy.  OMB makes me happy. More happy than any brewery, and for that I thank you. Thank you OMB."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a bunch of tables and benches in their outdoor area. They also allow dogs so that's a plus. There's also a huge indoor space with a lot of seating. Their beer was great but the food was OK. Definitely a must if you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Only four beers on tap, none of which were particularly good. Service was awful. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Love the new venue!  Service was so good and friendly.  We had just come from Hyde where service and attitude was lacking.  Appetizers were good - wings, pretzel and Conch fritters."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great outdoor area with lots of tables, cornhole, music, and of course great beer! I prefer the seasonal options such as their Mecktoberfest in the fall and Captain Jack or Hornet's Nest in the summer, but always consider Copper a staple. Definitely suggest taking a tour if they are available, it's cool to go behind the scenes. Grab a bite to eat--- the menu offers excellent flavors. You must get a pretzel with the spicy mustard, and I always like the caprese sandwich! A perfect spot for a weekend afternoon or any weeknight."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far and each time is a great experience. German beer is not really my jam but I still love the atmosphere that this place provides (even when its rainy outside!). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places we have visited and so close to home.  We ordered flights and loved them all.  OMB Copper is our favorite and since being here we have found it on tap at almost every restaurant we dine in.  Delicious food too."}
{"text":"The food and beer were great first time there. We encountered three waitresses that were very rude! One waitress after being asked a question about a beer, just sat the beer own on the table repeated he name of he beer and just walked off! Very unprofessional wait staff. Although of permanent waiter was a former Marine he was great! The others were just flat out rude. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Solid brewery. I love the atmosphere, nice outside seating and the inside is really neat. Good beer, have yet to try the food, but that's on my list to do.   I wish they had more of a selection of brews. This summer, they've only had 2 or 3 on tap and I really want to see what else they can come up with.  Recently, maybe the past 2 times, their beers haven't been hitting the spot for me (I've been here maybe 8-10 times this summer drinking there and taking a growler to go). Like another reviewer said, they tasted skunky. I don't know if that's just my taste buds changing or if it's actually the beer, but something was off the last time I went.   I've been living in Charlotte since May and I've began to notice how many restaurants have OMB on draft. This makes me really happy because I can get local beer at a lot of the other restaurants and bars I frequent. I even looked up the list of restaurants in Charlotte and the surrounding areas that have OMB on tap and the list seemed endless!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on May 6th and had some of the worst service we've had in a long time. It took 20 minutes just for the server to bring us our drinks, just 2 beers. Nothing fancy. Then we waited over an hour for our food and all we ordered was a bratwurst and a chorizo sausage. We finally left because waiting that long for that small amount of food is absurd. When we told the server we just wanted to pay for the drinks and leave, she gave us attitude like we were inconveniencing her and pissing her off. The place was busy but if you can't keep your composure while being a server, you should probably find something else to do. I will stick to buying this beer in the store and cooking brats at home. I think I will have a much better time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. I had the pork Schnitzel and späetzel and it was out of this world. I will travel to Charlotte again just to eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing beer. Amazing atmosphere. Great service! This place reminded us of the German Army location at Ft Bliss that served authentic German beer and food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"While this place may be difficult to find, it is a very nice facility that will not disappoint the true beer lover. German food & well crafted beers remind me of the fatherland during the good old days of Kristalnitch. (Sp?) Himler would have loved this place, especially the frauleins! Auchtung!"}
{"text":"Very relaxed and welcoming environment.  German influenced menu. Had the Copper Ale and some Brats.  Both were very good.   Just passing through Charlotte and happy I used yelp to find this local place instead of some chain.  Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"What a great spot...so glad we found this spot...i will definitely be coming here more often. .i hear they are opening up a spot right down the road can't wait to see how awesome that will be. I will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Lately every time we have came the inside tables all day reserved, yet there is never anyone ever sitting at the tables. Because of this we have left twice for this inconvenience of service"}
{"text":"Great laid back atmosphere.  Very much like the beer gardens I experienced in Germany."}
{"text":"We wanted a place that was unique to Charlotte. OMB is close to the airport hotels. The menu highlites German specialty foods and beers brewed on the premises. The food was good. The beer was excellent and the staff courteous and attentive. Apparently a storm knocked their computers off line. Our meal and drinks were comped."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a weekend night. The fenced in outdoor yard is full of picnic tables, space for the kids to run around including games and a live band. You can order the full menu inside or a limited menu outside. My only complaint is the outside beer kiosk doesn't also serve wine. We ordered two cheese pizzas, a pepperoni pizza and a brat with french fries. The pizzas were more than enough for one person and the brat was tasty."}
{"text":"Visited OMB this past weekend for Mecktoberfest. The event has grown in size since we were there 2 years ago, so the outdoor tent was much bigger and food was included with the $25 price of admission, as were 2 beers. We were also given some sort of ticket for a prize drawing, which we never actually saw take place.  There were only 3 beers on tap, Copper, Captain Jack and Mecktoberfest. It's disappointing to go for an all out \"Oktoberfest\" and get your choice of wow... Three whole beers. Captain Jack was way too hoppy and Mecktoberfest was too sweet, so I settled on Copper.  The food was served by a catering company. I had the pulled pork which honestly, was the worst pulled pork I've ever eaten, anywhere. Baked beans from a can were also a disappointment. We purchased a pretzel later in the evening, which was cold. Definitely don't go to Mecktoberfest expecting decent food.  Between dodging the cigar smoke everywhere outside, and the smell of feces inside (it was later reported by a guy in our group that someone had done something tremendously foul inside the men's bathroom - so over the top I can't even explain here) the evening would have been a bust if it wasn't for the company I was with. By 9PM the place seemed mostly empty, no one was outside and the band stopped playing, so we left.  Overall, not nearly as enjoyable as our first visit to Mecktoberfest 2 years ago, which included much larger steins of beer instead of 21 ounce mugs. I'm not highly motivated to return to OMB for any events."}
{"text":"They have added a great deal to their menu int he last few months, the food has been a great upgrade. When one considers their great beer, headlined recently by the award winning Mecktobberfest (Great Amercian Beer Festival), this place is awesome"}
{"text":"It is very hard to like a place when you walk in for the first time and the sign says to seat yourself. We came for dinner and the long tables were mostly full and we couldn't find a place for four people to sit down and eat. There was no one greeting us so we did not know what to do. Should we have asked people to slide down so we could sit together? We stood there for sometime and decided that it was ridiculous to just stand there. We got the feeling that they didn't care about their guests so we left and will probably not give it another try. Not hospitable at all. I was disappointed because I had heard good things."}
{"text":"I'm into OMB.  I went to their brewery on Southside Dr last weekend and was able to go on one of their brewery tours.  Free tours happen on Sat at 2p, 3p, and 4p.  They started about 30 min late for our 2p tour - but I think that was to encourage product tasting beforehand in their \"tap room.\"  The tap room is a great space.  It has nice vaulted ceilings, beer hall chandeliers, and wood paneling.  It is a very clean and comfortable space.  I wish it was in a more urban location versus a warehouse district - but it is still nice for a daytime adventure.  The tour itself lasted about 30 min and was interesting - mostly covering their history, production process, ingredients in their beers, and german purity laws that they adhere to.  Beer is reasonably priced there - though there are only 3 OM options served - Copper, Mecklenburger, and a seasonal pick.  There is also food, but it is more of an accompaniment to the beer and consists of things like brats and giant pretzels."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is excellent and very family friendly.  The food is traditionally German, so it works perfectly with their beer and vibe.  We enjoyed their takes on classic brew and the friendly staff.  While they don't have a huge variety, what they do have packs a significant punch on the beer scene.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for a late lunch/early dinner yesterday.  We split a sausage plate and got 4 different kinds - Kielbasa, Weiss Wurst, Spicy Beef and something else.  They tasted good at the time, but after we got home, my stomach was shot for the rest of the night and this morning.  We also decided to split the apple strudel dessert - it's the only one they have and it sounded good and was recommended to us by our waitress.  I took one bite and didn't have any more - the strudel was burnt.  It was literally black all over.  The  ice cream had freezer burn on it. I'm normally not so particular and will eat most things at a restaurant, but this was so bad.  When I told the waitress, she apologized and took it off the bill right away.    It was an okay experience overall.  It was a big let down from out first time going here."}
{"text":"The food was great and authentic. I brought a few guests from back home and they loved it!  Two things I need to comment on. The flatware was very cheap and the fork actually broke. Also the waitress with blue hair was really a negative person. Not friendly at all, never greeted us or checked to see if our food was done properly. She actually got offensive when we asked questions about the menu. Sorry some people are new to this place and don't know the menu. Otherwise great experience menu food and beer selection"}
{"text":"The place has a great vibe and the beer garden is amazing. Unfortunately you can't sit outside and get food from the restaurant. You must order from the food truck which is the WORST food in Charlotte. After waiting 25 minutes the bratwurst was lukewarm, the sauerkraut was cold, and the bun was dries out. If you go, go for the beer or the ambience but DON'T go for the food."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks or food. Tons of indoor and outdoor seating. Service was quick and friendly. Sandwiches and sides were good. Beer is solid but slightly pricey for Charlotte."}
{"text":"We love OMB - its our favorite brewery.    They have a great selection of beer on tap and you can get growlers to go of your choice.  Their menu is really expansive and pretty much you can't go wrong with your order.  The prices are great and you can hang out all day with friends at their long family style tables.  Sometimes we bring games and you can always stay as long as you like.  The service is always really good too."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon something pretty special in The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery...a German brewery and biergarten that happens to serve pizza!  I could have thought they tried to have too many different things going on in one restaurant (especially when I saw a yoga class going on the biergarten), but I was just pumped to have many of my favorite things in one glorious place.  The only problem was that I wanted to enjoy some German cuisine - besides the 33 oz. beer - as well as pizza.  While there were some wurst options, I was happy to start with their tasty soft pretzel as a prelude to my pizza.  The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery has a few different pizza options, and I ordered their Butcher's Block made up of prosciutto, capicola, salami, and sausage with their house made tomato sauce and mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  I liked the way their crust turned out because it had some spots of very light charring but was soft overall.  The pizza was really loaded with meat that had some good spice too it.  The sauce and cheese were both good but didn't stand out near as much as the meat.  The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is definitely a place worth checking out on the west side of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  A group of us went on a Friday night for live music.  They are in dire need of an interior decorator.  We felt awkward as soon as we walked in the door.  There were basically picnic benches for tables and nothing on the walls.  The beer was good but the atmosphere is lacking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   I think it's a great place to take people who are in from out of town because I believe it represents the spirit of what the new Charlotte is all about. By that I mean that these guys are smart, entrepreneurial and not pretentious.  The food They hand out free pretzel sticks, they aren't home made or even spectacular but they are a very important part of the experience. I also had a brat worst on a bun and it was fantastic. Sure I could have done it at home but for 4 bucks!? And free pretzels? Add that to the beer and I was a happy camper.   The beer: they had 3 types on tap the Dunkel, the copper and a seasonal. All were tasty fresh and cold.   The tour: Our guide was knowledgeable both about brewing and about the business it was really cool to hear the story about how they started and what the growth plans are. He was enjoying the beer with us as we walked so it felt just like visiting a friend at his or her business.   The place: The area to have a beer isn't much to look at but it works. Outside is a fire pit which was really cool although the day we went it was too cold even for that. I hope to go again here in the spring and enjoy that part of the experience.   Over all I just wish it was open more than it is as I work around the corner and would love to enjoy a brew after a hard day at the office."}
{"text":"They have a big building that is nice with a great outdoor area is the bright spot of this place..but with my experience here the bartenders lacked any kind of personality and were not the brightest bulbs on the tree. My friend that was with me asked a simple question and the bartender threw the receipt at him I would not recommend this brewery... There are better breweries in Charlotte with better beer and staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool vibe every day of the week. I like Captain Jack and the Southside Weiss. Food is evolving. Several things on the menu work. Several things do not. So wish the pizza was better. Crust too thick and not crispy."}
{"text":"The beer was amazing, and I loved how they had a live band in the biergarten! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMB has such a large outdoor area and is perfect for a summer day. I love spending the afternoon here relaxing in the sun with a Capt Jack in my hand. The menu is slightly limited (pizza, german sausage, sandwiches). There isn't really any chicken on the menu so its a little limited from a food standpoint. There's usually live music outside which is great."}
{"text":"Love this brewery! Only tried their pretzel as far as food but the ambiance and the beers are great! Love bringing my dog here and spending a beautiful day outside watching my dog play with a beer in my hand :)"}
{"text":"We attended the May 20th Meck Dec event at Old Mecklenburg Brewery. As we walked outside to the beer garden, we passed a fellow dressed in white, with a tricorn hat. We went to the bar outside, and ordered two Captain Jacks, from a bartender who did nothing to make us feel welcome. We sat and drank the pilsners. Two-thirds through, we appraised the beers as not cold to begin with (although the glass mugs were cold) and so unpalatable as to be nearly undrinkable. They were flat, bitterly over-hopped and tasted like salt and flour... or cardboard. I then ordered a Hefeweizen, and a Munzler's Vienna lager. The hefeweizen, which was not cold enough, either, was hoppy. Hefeweizen is a German wheat beer. It contains no hops... except at OMB. The Munzler's lager was unpalatable, and nearly undrinkable. Allegedly, according to OMB, Martin Munzler was the first brewer in NC, during the mid-nineteenth century. That would certainly come as a surprise to the Moravians, whose Single Brothers' Brewery and Distillery opened in 1773. So much for beer brewing history, according to OMB. We went for the Meck Dec event. The one person in costume had disappeared, and there was no video showing about the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, as mentioned online, so, we were $28 down for a \"Hefeweizen\" that wasn't a hefeweizen, an unpalatable lager, said to be a tribute to Martin Munzler, who wasn't the first brewer in NC, and two Captain Jack pilsners. There were red, white and blue balloons, however.  We changed our minds about dinner, and returned home to eat. As we were leaving, I retrieved my credit card from the cashier, who asked, \"How was it?\" I replied, \"The lady found the hefeweizen overly hopped. The beer wasn't cold... and it was unpalatable.\" He parroted what I said. I realize that there is no accounting for taste, but I would think that someone in the hospitality industry could respond with an intention to check the temperature of the beer, and pass on to management our dissatisfaction. I read three reviews here before writing this. The posters mentioned the atmosphere and beer garden. One mentioned that they liked one of the three beers that they sampled. It seems to me that a brewery should serve good beer, first and foremost. We saw no reason to return."}
{"text":"After attending Yoga on tap (free every Tuesday) I worked up an appetite for the Butchers block pizza. It was full of flavor and meat. I also had the small roasted veggie salad. It was the perfect side size. Their entree salad size is very large (FYI). OMB offers a great brewery menu! I can't wait to try something new next time!"}
{"text":"First time here and it is a beautiful evening. They have a band which is nice. There is outdoor \"beer garden\" seating as well as air conditioned inside seating. Several beer and food stations where you can run a tab and it applies to all (so you don't have to keep going to the same spot). Good selection of beer. You can get food from the food truck or a full meal from inside. Lots of room to roam. I would definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I like OMB. Great family style brewery with the openness and probably the best brewery to bring dogs. I wish I liked the beer better - Capt. Jack is OK but for IPA people it's tough ( I realize IPA's are not a consideration here). Saturday we were there with a group and we got hungry - tried the pizza from the outside kitchen - terrible. Would have been better off going home and cooking a frozen pizza. The band - how about a good band with original music and not a cheese dick 80's band??  I still like OMB and will be back but it could be so much better."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 4 stars because I absolutely love their beer. They really need to work on their food, I've tried it over 20 times now same gross cafeteria food. If they step their food game up OMB will be unstoppable."}
{"text":"OMB is the kind of place you go to once with a friend, and that friend becomes obsessed with going and you're there for moral support, and so you go constantly, and eventually despite you not being so thrilled about it at first, you're now a fan.   They have a little food truck out in the beer garden that makes traditionally German foods, so I usually go for the burgers.   They're mostly known for their beers. If you're a beer fan, don't expect those kinds of beers brewed with all kinds of weird things in it - OMB operates under the German Purity Law (Connection: Mecklenburg was the place where Queen Charlotte was from in Germany. She was married to George III of England, who ruled the 13 colonies). If you're looking for something a bit different, they do shandies. One of the best ones I had was their grapefruit and wheat shandy - pretty summery!  If you're a soccer fan, they usually have bigger games on, and they do a lot of events for the Charlotte Independence.  If you're a yoga fan, they do one day a week (Tuesday?) where you can do yoga in the beer garden and take some sips of beer during downward facing dog and mountain pose.   I've always noticed that people will park out on the curb in front, and there's usually parking in the lot, so it might look full, but check out back.   Also, if you want a cool glass, you have to order inside. If you want a boring glass, order from the little kiosk in the beer garden."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here regularly since I moved here 2 months ago. I always take guests and family members here because of the laid back atmosphere. Plus they have wine on tap (!!!!) Huge plus for people who like the brewery atmosphere but aren't big beer drinkers, like myself. This place is very dog friendly too- And believe it or not I have met a lot of people here there through their dogs. They are great conversation starters ;) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really dug this place. I liked the feel of it -just a huge hall with tables in it -and the tour was very informative. It was nice to see where all they distribute their beer and have it on tap---seeing local businesses succeed always makes me happy. This would be a great place to take an out of towner who appreciates beer or to catch a game.   I tried the Mecklenberger and Cooper and both were tasty with full flavor. They had a cart dude outside selling brats and dogs but think they could really capitalize on a menu inside (at least apps instead of just pretzels). Last time I checked drinking copious amounts of beer leads to food consumption. And who doesn't love bar food?"}
{"text":"Love. Have an afternoon to kill? Go here. Rent out corn hole, drink beer outdoors, dog friendly, plenty of parking, great beer, and decent food. Call your friends and their friends as seats are plentiful."}
{"text":"I dont like beer, so I cant speak for the drinks, BUT this place was not what I was expecting. It's GORGEOUS! the building looks more like a winery than a brewery and there is a large room with indoor seating. They also have private rooms for events.  Then they have a massive, and I mean massive outdoor area with a ton of tables, bars to get drinks and a food truck. They also have corn hole and things like that. Im not a huge frequenter of breweries but I was really impressed with how nice and upscale this was. Definitely a really great place to hang out!  Only downside: There were A LOT of small kids. I get it, its a casual atmosphere that's outside, but it's still a brewery where adults are trying to have a nice night. it's not a daycare. Watch your freaking kids or get a babysitter."}
{"text":"Love the new location for OMB - lots of space, tables, outdoor games, and dog friendly. As a venue, it gets 5 stars. The beer they have is also pretty good.   The reason I gave it three stars is because the way the inside bar/food process is structured versus the outside bar/food process is very bizarre:  - If you want to sit outside its all self service, and inside is table service. - The staff is not that nice or helpful. We dealt with three bartenders and two servers while we were here and all 5 of them had an attitude problem. Maybe it's that they were stuck working a holiday weekend? Don't know. - The outside food is served from a food truck and not very good; essentially sub par bar food. - Outside food menu is limited to 5 items, while the inside food menu is several pages. - Outside bar is limited to 3 beers, while inside has a two page menu.  The best part of OMB is the outside space - but the limited service and menu makes the outside less enjoyable, which is a shame because it's an awesome space."}
{"text":"One would be unlikely to stumble upon this location. Camoflauged among several warehouse looking places on an inconspicuous road off of south Tryon, this spot is a brewery first and a place of consumption second. The latter is a small, beerhall style area with high ceilings, long tables and chandeliers. Service is present but could use some work - only after sitting with our beers for a good fifteen minutes did the bartender/server? inform us that she'd forgotten to put in our order until just then. The brats were tasty, served with yummy German inspired sides on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. As a fairly young brewery it is understandable that the beer selection is focused on the two very drinkable standards, copper and mecklenburger, and the rotating seasonal, in winter a dunkel. After noshing we waited for the brewery tour (free on Saturdays!). It started a bit late but we got the beer 101 treatment, and learned all about this young brewery's mantra: fresh beer, pure ingredients, no preservatives, all local. It's promising. Still, none of it's current brews stick out much to me - as a Belgian style/IPA fan, nothing was quite hoppy or spicy enough, although the dunkel has a satisfying roasted flavor. Maybe with some years and experimentation I'll find a beer to love from olde meck. Either way I'd say this spot is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I stopped in whiile traveling thru because I had heard good things about the beer.  I had their lightest beer, which seemed to have a bitter taste, but after my second glass it started to taste better.  I ordered a braut, it wasn't good.  The roll was cold and tasted stale.  The braut looked like it had been heated in a microwave, no grill or stove marks and it had a after taste.  My advise is to stick with the beer.  My partner had the Copper and seemed to really enjoy it.  Again, after the second glass.  I guess this stuff has to grow on you."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is great. It looks like a German beer garden. Lots of seating and of course the beer was good too!!"}
{"text":"First off I know it's really controversial to say this but I am a big fan of old mecks hornets nest. It sucks that it's a seasonal beer there but gotta love it while it's around. So that being said we did have the food while there and that's the only reason they get 4 start and not the full 5. The \"German\" bratwurst and knock wurst was less than what they should have been. They seemed to have a very bland flavor. So other than the food the beer and activities you can do there always promise a good time."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Olde Meck's beers since before it moved into this location (used to be on Southside where Sugar Creek is currently located), and since before they served any discernable sort of food with their beers...   That being said, this new location has REALLY been such a facelift and a vast improvement for an already wonderful line of good, German-style beers!  The outdoor biergarten section is perfect for gatherings of friends, family, furry family, and even kids!  The additional outdoor bar and food truck make going inside on a beautiful day completely optional (unless you require the loo)... The inside, however, is nothing to smirk at!  Long communal tables are great for several small groups OR one big one!  It's not odd to see the place completely packed to the gills inside, and their full menu is served with full service there!    Their food is heavenly!  The portions are BIG and NOTHING is mediocre.  I was there this past Sunday to celebrate my Father-in-Law's 70th birthday with a bunch of family... I knew we'd have cake later and I was already drinking beer... so I opted for a salad... I got the Arugula Salad with Salmon as my protein... the salmon was perfectly cooked, the plate and portion of salad was enormous, and the dressing was light, tasty, and not at all overpowering... an excellent meal!  If you decide to go for a classic pretzel & beer cheese option, though, you won't be sorry!!  Regarding their beers, I'm a die-hard fan of Hornet's Nest, and their seasonal Bauern Bock... Both are drinkable, enjoyable, always fresh, and perfectly delightful!  All of the others are also amazing... I've really never had any beer here that I could accuse of being \"bad\"... not all are to my taste, but that's life, right?  In short, this is a grassroots Charlotte establishment which has paid its dues and earned a loyal following of visitors.  You could do worse than to spend a lovely afternoon with friends & family at our beloved OMB!"}
{"text":"Still love this place and the \"beer tasting beer\".  My wife and I just visited the new location and expanded Biergarten.  Fantastic!    I hope the get a more permanent beer kiosk for the Biergarten -- perhaps a chinesisch Tür like englischen Gärten  im München.  The lines are shorter outside, but the beer is colder inside.    The food options have expanded and this place will be on our return list, and always near the top."}
{"text":"YUM! My sister is in town and wanted to do something different while visiting the Queen City. My husband brews his own beer and thought it might be neat to take a tour of a brewery to show my sis what he does on a much larger scale. Our 'tour guide' was really dynamic and informative. They let you drink the beer when you're on the tour, which was a bonus! We sampled all of the beers they had to offer and all of them were really yummy! They have house made pretzels and spicy musturd to order, which I would definitely reocmmend. Love that they are local and just serve the charlotte metro area. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Even though, we are from out of town, as soon as we came upon this venue, we could see how popular it is. First of all, it's quite large with lots of seating inside and outdoors.  My husband and I were here on a mild January night. The patio had heaters set up through and there was a fire in a pit.   A nice selection of beers to pick from along with some seasonal choices.  My husband's favorite was the OMB Hornets Nest.  I am not much of a beer drinker so I chose Pinot Gris that satisfied my thirst.  Food is available.  We had the large, salted pretzels.  The evening we were here, there was live music.    It was very nice to visit this brewery. There was a varied cross section of people.  Young adults meeting up with friends. Parents were enjoying their beverages and food, while their children were playing on the outskirts. Dogs are welcome on the outdoor patio as long as they are on a lead.  I really enjoy a place that makes room for everyone.  I would recommend to anyone that they stop in."}
{"text":"This is a great Brewery! visited October 2014. My Husband & I wanted to get out on a sunny fall Saturday and we drove here. We had lunch inside and took some brews outside to enjoy in their lovely outdoor seating area. Selection is very good and the tour was informative.  I do recommend this brewery."}
{"text":"I love Olde Meck's fresh beer. There isn't one that I dislike! You can taste how fresh the beer is. The new place is awesome and HHUUUGGGEEE! The food is pretty good, you can't go wrong with any of the wursts.         I did have an issue that I made clear to management. They were quick to offer me a pint and replace the item I ordered. The were very professional and courteous. I really enjoy visiting, with my family and friends. Thanks for choosing Charlotte to brew your beautiful beer!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately upon our visit the kitchen was closed, and only the bar menu was available, so we didn't get the full dining experience. However, the brats and kielbasa were delicious, and the pretzel with the bier cheese was great. The bier cheese had really good flavor, not too powerful, and a good consistency. My husband and I both got the Mecklenburg Octoberfest beers and were satisfied. Our only complaint was that the \"litre\" sized drink was not a full litre."}
{"text":"I am a huge OMB Copper fan. We finally decided to go to the brewery for the first time Saturday. Great outdoor area for large groups. But what I was not impressed with is the fact that a beer came out to be almost $7 with tax. Maybe the pour is larger than the usual pint? Majority of the time when I get a copper at restaurants it is maybe $5-$6, I thought since I was at the direct source the beer would be a little cheaper than it was. Pretzels were $6 w/ beer cheese.. stale & not worth it. I will continue to drink OMB but I don't know that I will be back to visit the brewery. Maybe we just came at a bad time."}
{"text":"OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this place. Yes, the beer hall atmosphere is nice, but when we went they only had 2 beers. 2 beers?! What kind of brewery only offers 2 beers? They had the signature OMB Copper and Captain Jack Pilsner. We both got the OMB Copper, which was just fine if not particularly unique.   The pretzel another reviewer raved about was nothing more than a Superpretzel Soft Pretzel that you can get from the freezer section at Wal-Mart, and the brat wasn't much more impressive.   I could see how it might be fun to come here with a big group for a tour and tasting, but don't think I'll be back any time soon..."}
{"text":"I'll take a Copper please...no wait, a Mecktoberfest...but wait, maybe a Mecklenburger...hmmm...oh hell, I'll have one of each! I'm a huge fan of OMB. Have had in in restaurants for months (the cool places have the local stuff on draft!), but on my recent visit to the actual brewery I was in love. Keep in mind, this is a one year old brewery, so don't go expecting a gift shop and gourmet menu, etc. The OMB tap room makes you welcome by serving great beer in a cool environment. Tables all lined up for people to mingle and sit next to each other with some seating along the side. There is some seating outside too.   If you haven't visited OMB before, October is a great time to do it. A little hard to find, but once you do, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer (love Fat Boy!), great German sausages....service is spotty. We frequent OMB but had a very rude waitress last time and the food wasn't very good - hard + burnt pretzel, burnt sausages. We told the waitress the sausages were burnt and she basically said we have to deal with it because that's how they are served (although we have ordered them at least 20 times and they're not typically burnt). We will continue to go for the beer & the atmosphere but not for the food."}
{"text":"I have been to old MecklenBurg on several occasions and they never disappoint. First off the grounds of the brewery are awesome, Cornhole, picnic tables, food trucks, Biergarten bar what more could you ask for. The beer is some of the best if not the best locally produced German style beer. The Food is excellent and quite authentic, a friend of ours is from germany and she loves most of it because it reminds her of home. I have never eaten inside because we are always here during the day and just want to be outside enjoying the fresh air and sunlight. The inside bar is pretty impressive though with all the beer on draft and bottles that can be purchased for take home. You can pick up a keg of something directly from them as well. We are winning on all fronts here in my personal opinion. I love this place and will continue to come back especially through the fall when the leaves on the giant tree, not show if its a oak or maple of some kind, start to change this place is going to just amazing on another level. An event to look out for that is excellent and super fun is the German Christmas Market. Nothing like drinking beer or Hot german Mulled wine on a cold night during christmas to get you in the spirit."}
{"text":"I know this place and it's beers are pretty popular in the charlotte area but I just can't get into them. I've tried several of their beers and even went by their tasting room for the BBQ/Cornhole deal they put on this last weekend but I still don't like them. The beers themselves taste a little skunky to me and I get it that it's supposed to be \"german beer\" but they just seem to be missing something in the brewing process or adding another step or whatever it is, just makes them taste off to me. I would still much rather have beers from Noda brewery or even Birdsong before OMB. The one thing I can say is that their tasting room/brewery is done up very nicely. There is plenty of seating for everyone and the interior is all new and very clean. They could probably use a couple more TV's as they only have one above the bar and it's at a angle where only a small part of the room can see it."}
{"text":"Super cool brewery we ample outdoor and indoor seating!! Awesome spot to hang out during the summer!"}
{"text":"We love the biergarten at Olde Meck, great space and atmosphere.  Their beer is consistently good and they often have live bands.  A nice sunny Charlotte day is perfect for beer at Olde Mecklenburg..."}
{"text":"Besides church this is my favorite place to come! It has the best beer & food around! The owner John Marrino is a genius!!!! Dylan Manion is also a genius! They both exemplify what it means to run a good solid business!!! They are not only bottom line driven and it shows!! The employees are awesome!!! John and Dylan value them so much it's awesome to see! Other businesses should follow suit! It's no surprise why they are continuing to grow! Do yourself a favor and go check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place recommended by someone I know that lives locally. Food and beer was excellent, friendly staff. My husband and I had a very nice visit from out of town.  We enjoyed talking to Allison and Shelley from the area that sat next to us. Gave us some history and recommendations. We would definitely come back if we were to be in town again. We also went out to the patio which was very cool. Enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"Love the brauts and beers here for casual dinners! We like to eat dinner here for the brauts, which come with a side--the German potato salad is my fave! The pretzel rolls are soft and buttery. The beer I like the best is Captain Jack. Great patio area and outdoor casual seating if the inside is crowded, and you can get food outside from the food truck. Classic CLT beer!"}
{"text":"This is such a great hidden gem.  A brewery hidden away in the warehouse district off South Blvd makes you feel like your in an old world beer garden.  The bratwurst is awesome and the beer is even better."}
{"text":"This is by far is my favorite brewery in Charlotte.  Upon arriving, you feel like you're going into a theme park for adults.  The property is sprawling and has an enormous indoor dining hall type area and an even bigger outdoor area.  We ended up outdoors where they had a food truck and beer truck, and live music.  They had a large grassy area for kids to play, dogs to run and even had some cornhole games.    The food was great and I didn't feel like I was being shortchanged by ordering from the food truck compared to the inside kitchen.   We ordered brats, a hot dog, and a soft pretzel.  The beer was awesome and SO reasonably priced.  Because I'm drawn to porters and stouts, my favorite was the Fat Boy but all beers were delish.    I loved the atmosphere and diversity of this particular brewery.  I'm going to sound cheesy but to see people from all different age groups, ethnicities and walks of life coming together for their love of the same item was something really great!"}
{"text":"Good experience. Entrance to restaurant was confusing but was beautiful.  Even though they make their own beers, offer wine but NO liquor :( Tea was ok. Pretzel w/beer cheese like other places. Burger was great! Tasty & juicy! Salmon pita was great too! Wait staff helpful and always checking on us."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food were great. In my opinion the beers were too watered down and didn't taste like much. Great service just not beer.."}
{"text":"CAME FOR AN EVENT. Came for a private event. It was my first time visiting OMB. So here is why I gave it 3 stars. In the private room, they brought in a couple of kegs of their beer, great, awesome. But with beer, you need food. We could not order food from their mini bar they had set up. The bar tenders told me that I could go to the real bar, place an order, and bring it back in if we wanted to. But they couldn't explain why I couldn't order food from them and have it delivered to the private room. We decided not to eat there and waited and ate after our event."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have ever been to OMB. My husband and I live I  Union County, while our friends were out of state. We kept bragging about how great the beer is. Sadly, I was highly disappointed. And it was all over a damn pizza.  There were 5 of us at a table. My husband and our friend ordered beers at the bar. Cool. We all order food. Cool. All 4 other part members received their food except for me, and it even took a long a time for them to get their food. I kept being told it would be another 5 minutes. I said that if I finished my beer before the pizza came, I didn't want it. Well, we ended up getting the pizza for free and I took it home with me. Cool. I totally understand it was probably not the waitress' fault. But, telling a patron that it would be another 5 minutes, when I literally for my pizza moments before we got our checks is sad. There were two other parties who were seated, ate and left before I received my pizza.  The pizza wasn't as great as I thought it would have been anyway. Hardly any basil and not enough dough. Margherita is my most fav, and I've had better.  Also, the beer cheese with the pretzel wasn't as great according to our friend. The cheese didn't have the \"beer kick\" that he was expecting. And the beer was excellent (as  always)."}
{"text":"I got the German vibe immediately walking into OMB.  Big tables with no backs to the chairs, the bar had no stools but the beer is where it is at.  I had my fill of all of the choices and I was not disappointed.  We just happened to visit on Tuesday which was yoga night and the local talent was as good or better than the beer.  Next visit to Charlotte, I will visit; probably on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. More seating available than I've seen at most breweries, and the patio is great. The food was pretty standard bar food (pretzels with beer cheese, wings, brats), but it was all great"}
{"text":"This review is for the tour only, not the beer (which is quite good) or food (which we didn't have). While waiting for the tour, a waitress came over to take our food order. We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for some beer and dinner with friends that live in the area. Fun place to be - they do an awesome job. Pretzels and currywurst were amazing. Wasn't a huge fan of their Vienna lager, but the Copper Altbier is nice and tasty. Service is awesome too."}
{"text":"I met some friends here, and I suppose my rating is a bit low, since I am not a beer drinker.  There wasn't much else offered to drink besides beer, and for a German themed menu, not to offer Riesling or some other light German wine seemed weird to me.  There is no other alcohol here besides beer and wine.  So I settled on soda, which had no ice.  It appeared  there is no ice machine.  The menu was limited, and was hard for me to order, since I'm gluten free.  I gave it three stars, since I've been to many restaurants where not drinking beer and being gluten-free is not a death sentence for my appetite.  If they expanded their menu slightly and offered a small variety of other alcoholic drinks besides beer, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Really neat atmosphere with great people watching, but the beers aren't the greatest at all and food is okay. Pretzels with beer cheese are great and captain jack is an easy drinking beer though."}
{"text":"I do yoga here every Tuesday. Great place to just hang out as well. Their beer selection is very good and they are doing a great job of bringing the community together."}
{"text":"We've been loving OMB beers for 2 years now, and are really glad that the full kitchen is now open! Head out on Friday night for beer, dinner, and live music, or Saturday afternoon for football and a tour. Also, be sure to get tickets for Mecktoberfest (October 1st, 2011) because that is a day of fun that you'll be sorry to miss."}
{"text":"Worst beer of any microbrewery in Charlotte, one of the best spots to drink of any micro-brewery in Charlotte.  That's why it gets a three (1+5 divided by 2 = 3 (I think))  Hey. I've got an idea.  Sneak in a six-pack from Sugar Creek across the street and play corn-hole.  Booya.  But hey, as my good friend Samuel L. Jackson said, \"It'll get you drunk!\""}
{"text":"Terrible service. Didn't see out waiter for over 40 min. He literally went MIA. Someone else dropped our food off that was not the waiter, we literally didn't see our waiter after he took our order. Plus drinks were finished soon after getting food. No one came to ask us if we were ok. Thanks for offering to top us off. First dining experience while visiting Charlotte and seriously disappointed. Plus pizza was dry too. Don't waste your time and money coming here when they busy. Service and quality goes out the door."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. Had the Teller plate, red cabbage and spätzle. Tasty, plenty of food and a very good price. Didn't match traditional German food exactly, so don't expect that, but quite good. Definitely recommend when it's nice outside, lots of long tables set up outdoors like a biergarten to enjoy beer and fresh air."}
{"text":"A fun venue with traditional German food. Try the currywurst. If you aren't a beer drinker (like me), you might not get much out of the biggest draw but everyone else seems to love the beer."}
{"text":"This is an awesome brewery. The place is huge. The options are many. The quality of the beer is great. The food is really good too. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating and it looks like an outside bar as well that's open probably on the busier days."}
{"text":"This was the first time I visited the new location and it was during a wedding reception. Awesome venue. They were able to rope off part of the patio and give us our own private bar with wine and champagne along with their awesome beers on tap.   Everything was really pretty at night and we even had our own cornhole boards. I was able to try the pretzel with beer cheese, which was pretty good. I was surprised at how  much I enjoyed their new beers. I had the lighter beers, which was a great addition to their portfolio."}
{"text":"I'm totally a fan of this spot. For one main reason....the back patio!   It's so spacious back there. There's games, tons of tables and benches and the option to grab some snacks and beer without having to go inside.   Not to mention it's always a great selection of beer on tap so I've tried something different with each visit.   I love the location and the vibe here so I'm sure to be back several times!"}
{"text":"He Said:  We had high hopes for this spot so close to our hotel, so much so that we stopped by for a quick snack and beer before dropping one of our number at the airport for her flight today (ours is tomorrow).  Our intent was to head back afterward to have a few more beers and dinner.  Unfortunately, that wouldp't be happening.  The list of complaints for the food is long: the pretzel was hard in spots, we debated sending it back. The beer cheese was bland. The Caesar salad had soggy croutons, lifeless lettuce and watery dressing - it tasted as though it was thrown together earlier in the day and left to sit in the fridge. The Brats (both kinds) were disappointing in their lack of flavor and low juiciness/fat content. The hummus was too garlicky, which says a lot coming from us.  The Hungarian sausage was quite good, so this was the bright spot, and we also liked the mustard.  I had a pilsner and it is quite good.  A well-made classic. I had a few sips of the Baltic Porter, but will leave that to She.  She Said:  The pilsner was good. As He noted, the Hungarian sausage was flavorful. The wait staff was nice. The beer garden looked like it might be fun under the right circumstances. As for the Baltic Porter, He liked it better than I did. I love the style, but I've had better. This one had a bit more of a boozy flavor than I would like.  It definitely gets a \"meh\" rating. I doubt we'll ever return.  Potty Points: I didn't have to use the bathroom, but my daughter did. When she returned, I asked for her review so that I could award points. The bathroom gets 5 out of 5 points. My girl said, \"It smelled disturbingly good. So good that I lingered in the bathroom longer than I would have otherwise.\" I was tempted to visit the bathroom just for that experience, but we had to get the girl on a plane, so I passed. I don't think I'll return for the bathroom, but that does seem like the best reason to visit."}
{"text":"Yes to the food. Yes to the beer. Yes to the space.   We went on a cold evening when they had their outdoor market open. There were plenty of local artists and vendors, and more than enough beer. Several food and beverage stands kept people warm and happy, which was good because they were seriously lacking warmers, or fires, or anything. People were huddled up and elbowing in to the few warming areas they had. We opted to grab a table inside, which only took about 20 min and a couple glares. Tables and first come first serve, basically survival of the most hungry (or thirsty). The short wait was worth it.   I attempted to order their seasonal beer, but they were out. Between all the people at our table and a few rounds I tried most, and I approve. The food was traditional German with a twist. We ate with our friends who lived in Germany for several years and they were very impressed with the authenticity of the food and were excited to return for more. I had the spaetzel, which by fiance almost ate all of. Which was ok because I also enjoyed his wurste was also delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"Such a great brewery!!! I love going in the summer for music and beers under the trees!! The patio is huge making it a welcoming space for everyone from small family's to college students. This is a must every time I'm in  Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place.  The patio is huge and perfect for day drinking/spending a cool evening. They do not have a huge selection of beers, but I like several of the ones they offer. They serve food as well. It is standard pub fair but does the trick. The facility is brand new and very great atmosphere. The service is excellent. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. We saw Restless Carolina on a Saturday night. Good food, great beer, great music. Some of the family didn't like that they didn't serve domestic or liquor but hey, it's a business and the outdoor seating was superb. Loved the dog friendliness and kid friendliness of the venue. Everyone seemed to be having a great time and I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there today and found this restaurant just OK.  My Reuben sandwich was good, but my wife's chicken wrap was bad.  The beer is good, but no better than a lot of other places.  The server was friendly and was probably the highlight of our visit."}
{"text":"Had appetizers from here it was basic simple finger food and not too bad. I dont remember exactly the name of it but thr tuna with pita bread was good & so was the hummus.  Boyfriend had the copper beer amd he loved it and recommends it."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but great things about this place and I visited for the first time tonight. I was surprised to see that this place was self- seating. On a Saturday night this seemed difficult but I was happy to wait. We noticed a family leaving so I waited for more than 20 min to eventually get up and leave and someone sitting outside saw me and came in and sat on the table as I was setting my drink on the table.   Now I understand that old meck has nothing to do with this but I urge you to change this because I was left with nothing but a bad taste in my Mouth. We ended up waiting for 20 more Min and leaving having tried nothing. I watched several frustrated customers leave or linger uncomfortably by other people."}
{"text":"Great beer! The food should be only served inside avoid the food truck! Seth the manager was awesome! Best bock around!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and tons of space and games in the yard area. Servers know their beers too and super friendly! The crab dip is amazing!"}
{"text":"David and I visited the Olde Mecklenburt Brewery last night for the first time to attend the Brewer's Ball  benefiting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. We enjoyed the Copper and Mecktoberfest.  We'll definitely be back to check it out again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually complain, but I felt rather rudely attended to by the staff. I wet to a charity function there yesterday, but unfortunately only got there around 5:30.  They offered a ticket for beer, which I accepted. Afterwards, since I didn't have any of the food since everything was closed down I figured I'd sit, watch some of the football, and have a wurst. When  spoke to the staff (it was the first time I had been there), I was told that I could not be served - never mind that I'm 61. No reason was given - whether there was a concern that I was drinking during the event. The food was fine, but I was expecting the wurst to come on a roll, which it wasn't. I will truly debate gong back there again because of this experience!"}
{"text":"Yet another place that I have been wanting to check out for a while.  The wife and I were in the area and decided to stop by for a beer and do just that.  Unless you live in the South End, it can be a little out of the way to get here, but definitely worth the effort. We weren't sure what to expect, but overall it's a taproom attached to their main brewery operation, which also serves food.  The food menu can best be described as German inspired pub food, but we did not partake in anything but beer.   I really like their Dunkel so I opted for that and the wife is more of a barreled beer fan and she chose their bourbon barreled porter called Fat Boy.  For my palate, both of those beers are some of their best.  From what I could see from their beer menu, they offer several sizes from samplers all the way to pitchers.  The service was good and attentive, and you can order at the bar as well as table service is provided. They also have some outside seating with games like corn hole making it a great place for groups.  Next time, we will have to sample some of the food."}
{"text":"Huge beer garden, great location and the beer is pretty good.  Im not a very German centric beer guy but what they have is pretty good.  And lets not overlook Tuesday mass yoga class.  About 200 pairs of Yoga pants and wow!"}
{"text":"Having just moved here after a two year tour in Stuttgart Germany, we were homesick for Oktoberfest while all of our friends were posting their fest pics.  We ventured out despite the rain and mit kinder for a night out.  The fest tables, light fixtures and German band made us feel right at home.  The food was typical fest fare you would find in Germany.  My daughter loved the spaetzle and my husband the German potato salad.  I finally was satisfied to find a REAL stinky authentic Pilsner!!!!  I have been so disappointed with all the flavored local craft selections.  A good true fresh beer well made is hard to find in the USA.  We took home a growler of the Mecktoberfest because it was tasty as well along with a 6 pack of Captain Jack.  The only things missing to complete the evening would be the half a chicken (another standard fest menu item) and the U-bahn to get us home.  Thank you Old Mecklenberg Brewery for the German fix!"}
{"text":"The beer is awesome.  The German food is loosely based on great festhaus foods..  The schnitzel is too thin and overly breaded.  There is a weird spice in the \"jager\" gravy.  The bratwurst had a weird spice in it that we have never tasted in bratwursts we have had before.  The red cabbage was overly sweet with sugar.  We have eaten at German restaurants up and down the east coast.  I would say order the pretzel and a beer - The copper or the fatboy and enjoy.  They do have live music on the weekends.  You have to seat yourself and you sit at long tables near strangers - reminiscent of the German family seating.  The beer and ambiance were the reasons for the 4 stars.  The food was a real let down."}
{"text":"Cool place, lots of care taken in its decor and construction - nice place to grab one and the pig picking and corn hole tournament event was really fun.  Service - great!"}
{"text":"OMB is a great place to have some tasty beers and hang out with some friends.  The atmosphere is cool.  It's a wide open modern building with hardwood floors.  I tried their Mecktoberfest brew yesterday and it was delicious!  And I'm always a fan of the Copper as well.  The only downfall to this place for me is they don't serve any kind of snacks.  The hubby and I met with our university alumni group early in the evening but we didn't have a chance to eat beforehand.  I was starving by time we were finishing up our drinks and ready to leave, not to mention having beers on an empty stomach did a number on me.  We will definitely be back for more, but I'll make sure to eat first."}
{"text":"Joined The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery for their 4th Anniversary party and to try out their brews and enjoyed it thoroughly, mostly because my husband got their bourbon brew and underestimated the alcohol content.  Hilarious.  Enjoyed a nice soft pretzel and their potato salad and grilled cheese.  The food wasn't amazing, but wasn't bad and went great with their cold beers.  I went for their amber ale, and for someone like me who isn't a beer expert by any means, it was good.  Nice big open space, live music, good affordable food and a nice young crowd makes for a good night and good times.  Hopefully, they'll do some more marketing and have more live music and I can definitely see myself coming back again."}
{"text":"This brewery has two awesome things going for it:  Although some claim it's not \"craft beer\" enough, I've never had a beer like it in the states. That's a lot more unique then some douple IPA that every craft brewery has made, right? It's local, and boy do they keep it that way. The beer is made by some exceptionally-tongue-twisting-named German purity law, which means it's only got four ingredients in it - water, yeast, malt, and hops. Not an ounce of preservatives or fillers. Can you seriously argue with that? And I don't care how many IPAs you've drank -- you haven't had anything until you've had a beer that was kegged THAT DAY! Amazing!  The tap room also has the best ambiance of any brewery or brew-pub I've been in. Large ceilings, dark wood, long table and German flags hanging on the rafters make for a seriously cozy feeling. Also, I do believe they now have a small kitchen and serve food during all open hours. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great.......venue is comfortable......beer is my favorite in Charlotte. There is a food truck and a beer station outside so you don't have to go back inside if you don't want. However, if table service is your fancy, then they have communal tables inside which offers more menu items. I always take home a growler to enjoy their beer at home."}
{"text":"I have been to Germany many times and this place is as authentic as it will ever get. The food was outstanding as was the beer. This has been my favorite place for a long time. Whenever I have friends in town, this is where we go."}
{"text":"Don't go if you want to eat. They can't handle crowds and they don't care. Wait for a pretzel was 1 hour!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went here two weekends ago. Since it was a beautiful Saturday, we wanted to sit outside while enjoying their food. Seeing as it was around 2pm, we were ready for lunch, having just come from another brewery! We had heard that they had German-style food, and we were excited. We found out that in order to have lunch from Olde Meck while outside, you had to sit on the sidewalk and not on the gravel. We waited for a table to open up, and then the 9 of us sat down at the table.  We were greeted promptly, and the waitress took our drink orders. She came back a little later and took our food order. Several of my friends ordered a plate where you can order two different types of sausage and two side items. After waiting a little bit, my wrap came out and my friend's burger came out. The rest of the group had ordered the different types of sausage. I hate to say this, but there was extreme confusion between the kitchen and the food runners. Unfortunetly, almost none of the sausages were on the correct plate with their correct side dishes. What was frustrating for my friends was that they didn't know what the type of sausages were supposed to look like; they just knew what they had ordered. It took a really long time, and one of my friends getting very upset with the waitress and manager, before everyone got their correct food. By then, we all just wanted to go. We ended up getting the entire meal comped, which was very nice of them, but it was still frustrating.  My husband likes their beer, so we may go back again to try the beer. I just wouldn't recommend the restaurant aspect of Olde Meck."}
{"text":"Great, friendly, VERY WELL HIDDEN, place.  For connoisseurs of outstanding German-style beer, absolutely fresh, and absolutely authentic.  Open Wed. - Sat. closing early every night except Friday--understandable, since it really is a brewery-with-a-pub, not a bar.  Great bratwurst & cabbage too.  EIN PROSIT!!!"}
{"text":"A brewery less than 5 minutes from my house... What can be better??? This small brewery puts out some really good beers. I am a pale ale kind of guy, but the copper and seasonals are quite tasty. The tour isn't too bad, but due to the size of the place, it is over quickly. This is a great place to go and grab an afternoon beer on the weekend without your typical bar scene."}
{"text":"Charlotte classic and always a good time. Not the best brewery in the charlotte but still always in my top 5."}
{"text":"the waitstaff was slow and unorganized, appetizers were forgotten or brought out after main courses, but the food was decent.  pretzels were good but the beer cheese, not so much. the caprese sandwich was good but the focaccia was a little hard to bite into.   might try sitting outside next time, seemed like a fun atmosphere w/live music and tons of picnic tables."}
{"text":"OMB is a great place in Charlotte for a cold one and some bites along. The beer garden is fantastic.   I have only one negative: it is too far away from MY home."}
{"text":"Not only is the beer selection outstanding but their German potato salad is delicious as are all the sausages I have tasted to date.  Great place to go and hang out with friends and just BS."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place good brew great food I eat there every time I come to town ....I always have to take a part of Charlotte home with me and brew comes home with me"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker, but I will drink the OMB Copper. The pretzel with beer cheese is great too. Biggest brewery in Charlotte. Usually pretty busy, but you can always find room and quick service. They do Yoga there on Tuesday nights. Get there early if you don't want to be stuck in the back."}
{"text":"OMB is such a phenomenal staple of Charlotte. No matter the time of year, whenever I have a friend or family member visit, we have to go to OMB. It's a great atmosphere for all ages. Their Biergarten is expansive and comfortable. Even on their busiest days there's still plenty of seating outdoors. I've never eaten inside but it looks like an authentic German bar. Obviously the best part is how dog friendly it is!   I love that they brew their own beer and have rotating seasonal beers. The prices are great and you can never go without getting a soft pretzel with beer cheese!"}
{"text":"Service really needs to be improved.   We were a party of 5.  They bought the completely wrong entree for my daughter, plus I was given the wrong side item.  My daughter only ordered a sandwich, not that difficult to fix.  Unfortunately, we all had finished our food by the time she received her correct order and I got my cucumbers.  Also, why have a hostess if you have to seat yourself.  We took longer than normal eating because we had to wait for my daughter's food to arrive.   She felt uncomfortable since customers were obviously standing by us waiting for the table so she only ate half and asked for a box.  It wasn't a fun experience at all. It was a very chaotic."}
{"text":"By far the best beer garden space in Charlotte.  Insane amount of seating and typically have music, plenty of corn hole boards, dogs allowed outside and seem to constantly have rooms book for parties and corporate events.  For those that don't know OMB is a traditional German brewery that sticks to authentic recipes and goes by the 1516 purity law that beer is only made from malt, hops, yeast and water.  If you are big into IPAs, fruity beer, sours, etc.  Their beer may not be for you.  For me the only beer I like from them is their seasonal Marzen.  But I would definitely say if you are into visiting cool breweries definitely put this on your map if just for the size, design and atmosphere, as well as free tours on the weekends."}
{"text":"Two of the three servers I interacted with were rude to me. I can recommend the Dunkel and the Mercktoberfest brews, but all of the usual food trucks were closed and we waited about 25 minutes for a table--Almost average experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best German food and the beer selection was outstanding. Wish I could go there more often."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite Charlotte brewery and a beautiful place. I hope their new location is just as well setup and makes good use of the additional space."}
{"text":"All I can say is don't go during a special event. They run a limited beer menu, but don't remove the ones they aren't offering from the chalkboards. Wanted to try their Schwarz but got stuck with their Mecktoberfest. While good, it was not what I would have picked. They also didn't offer their porter.   Food, has been a disappointment almost every time in the past year. It is to the point I miss what they were at their old location, back when they had a good currywurst. Today their schnitzel was a tasteless brick. Last time we tried to order from their food truck, it took 45 minutes and was not memorable.   If you go, skip the special events and make sure to eat in the brauhaus, that seems to be the only way to get their good food, and when it's good it's spot on. So disappointing. We used to come here regularly but every time I come now I less and less want to come back.   I loved their old location and am happy they've gotten popular enough to move to a bigger location, but some things have gone downhill since."}
{"text":"I'd love to give them 4 stars but it's more a 3.5 than a 4 (this review is only on the outdoor patio&bar, not the restaurant). On a Saturday afternoon after Christmas, we stumbled upon this neat spot during our self-guided brewery tour in Charlotte.  Located in the South End, the Olde Mecklenburg Brewery has a lot to offer  We were drawn to their humongous outdoor patio/lawn area - it was almost like a small park!  There were 20+ picnic tables, several cornhole boards, a food truck, and an outdoor bar.  Inside the brewery is a large restaurant & lots of bathrooms. The outdoor area is very dog friendly too :) Space, space, & more space!  And with space comes kids & lots of loud drunk people.  The beers were just okay- nothing to yell home about. The baltic porter was super boozy tasting (it was 8% but tasted 12%) but was still robust & flavorful. They didn't have anything too hoppy- in fact, I think they only had like 5 beers total, which was weird given how large the place is.   We ordered a pretzel with beer cheese from the outside bar & picked it up at the food truck area. There were tons of kids, families, and large groups of people in the outdoor area (almost overwhelming). We didn't eat inside the restaurant but it sure did smell good :)  All in all, this is seems to be a good place for large groups, families, and dogs. I'm not the biggest fan of kids at a brewery, and the abundance of space & outdoor games seems to draw them by the dozen.  If their beers were a bit better, I may give them 4 stars, but they're at 3.5 right now."}
{"text":"Beer was a 4.5-5! Service was a 2 at best. Our waiter spent more time at the bar talking to patrons there than on his tables. Food was ok...pretzel appetizer was awesome. Entree was ehh, fries rocked but the caprese panini was a sloppy, undercooked."}
{"text":"They stay consistent with there theme...from water without ice to canned sodas to the German Purity Laws.  OMB produces a consistent product and I'm proud of how well distributed Copper is in Charlotte. Now I need to head back and try the Hornet Hefeweizen.  Dunkel was great.  I wasn't a fan of the Fruebock, but we all have our tastes and that's not mine.  The food was good.  Maybe one of these days I'll check out the bicycle group they have."}
{"text":"There are so many things I love about Olde Mecklenburg Brewery: the fact that it was one of the first craft breweries on the scene in Charlotte, the amazing beer garden, the banquet space and beautiful interior of the new space, the group bike rides that start and finish at Olde Meck on Sundays, and the copious special events hosted at the site.   My issue is that I love the space, and I'm there several times a month for social events and bike rides, but am honestly not a huge fan of the beer. As a self proclaimed \"hop head,\" there is nothing on tap that really suits my fancy. I think Copper is okay and the Captain Jack pilsner is drinkable, but given the amazing space and ambiance, I wish there was more variety in the types of beer they serve.   Olde Meck is a great place for afterwork happy hours or to bring out of town guests, but I much prefer the beer at Sugar Creek Brewery (which is literaly across the street) to what is served at OMB."}
{"text":"I love good beer, and OMB is the best place to drink high quality beer in Charlotte. OMB has a great vibe, it has a lot of space and attentive employees. They have multiple beers, Copper, Mecklenburger, Captain Jack, and Mecktoberfest..are a few...some are light, some are darker. All the beers are smooth and have great flavor, just depends on what youre into that day. OMB even gives you free pretzels...A awesome place!"}
{"text":"Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is a great hang out. There is plenty of space for hanging out. They have great indoor and outdoor spaces with tons of picnic tables. They offer bar food that is fine but not amazing. The selection of beers is always great. Typically there's live music outside. He location is nice because you can park and visit various spots- broken Spoke, sugar creek brewing, and Queen Park social"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying this place is HUGE, I love all of the outdoor seating.. I also got a bit turned around and almost ended up crashing a wedding reception.   Favorites included the Radler & Mecktoberfest.  I wish that we had stayed at this brewery a bit longer but on brewery day we have to get our rounds in! Will be returning next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breweries I've been to.  I honestly can't think of one that tops it.   OMB has really built a first-class place with their outdoor area, private areas, crazy large brewing area, all-shaded parking lot and main room/bar area.  On the downside, I've been here a few times, different times of day and it has been super hard to ever find a spot at a table in the main room.  But thats good news for OMB, who ever would of thought that this little ol' brewery would be expanding like this and still bursting at the seams!  My food experiences range from Currywurst, to hummus to pretzels.  I've only stuck with appetizers, but if they're a representation of the real meal, the food is awesome.  When we ordered hummus, the sheer amount of it was crazy!  We had to get more pita chips to eat all the hummus and even then we struggled to finish it.    Take the tour - I learned so much when I got to go on a tour during the yelp event."}
{"text":"Reuben was out of this wrold. One of the best. Epic fail on the burger. Asked for rare and they couldn't get it right the second time....we went from well to med-well.  Spaetzle came out cold and had grease on bottom of plate, was not light and fluffy. Wings were good and generous portion. Beer is gold standard. Wursts and red cabbage was wonderful and pretzel roll was spot on. Food fail not good... However they took it off the bill without us asking."}
{"text":"The restaurant space is quite nice, the 8-acre #beer garden is pretty awesome and the #beers are respectable, but the food, I would say eat someplace else."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL brewery!  And the beers were tasty!  But if you wanna eat inside, prepare yourself for weirdness.  It's cafeteria style - no hostess.  You sit down at one of the long tables IF you can find space where people aren't reserving spaces for the cool kids.  We finally found a dirty spot, but luckily the waitress came over quickly and removed the dirty dishes & kinda wiped the table down.  The hummus was some of the best I've ever had, to my surprise.  And I'm not big into sausage, but the Currywurst was the curryBEST.  Amazing.  Rueben - outstanding...wish we'd ordered one on a pretzel roll.  The potatoes in the potato bacon side dish were raw, but the German potato salad was yummy!  If/When I go back, it'll be in warmer weather when I can sit outside at my own table - the courtyard is gorgeous.  While the beer & food were both great, literally rubbing elbows with the woman beside me while she loudly droned on about her bratty 2-year old was not.  If this place had a hostess & normal tables where I could choose my company, it'd be perfect."}
{"text":"We came here for the Louisiana festival. There's a large Biergarten and huge amount of indoor seating as well. Honestly one of the largest Biergartens I have ever seen. The beer was good... lots of space for dogs and kids running around. The food selection was limited to hot dogs, pretzels, jambalaya( which was over cooked but the taste was good), chicken fingers, fries, shrimps, and crawdads. Cool spot, I would come back again when in town."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with this place. The among of ppl they can accommodate is mind blowing. The place is huge. The outside sitting and the patio area is massive. On a beautiful day, it is perfect. Came on a Sunday when it was gorgeous outside. I ordered a beer. My girls ordered wine. Good selections to pleased the pickys. We order the wings, crab dips and later on burgers and pizzas. Wings were on point. Crab dips was great, breads was hella tough and wasn't enough of. burgers wasn't a hit and the pizza crust wasn't to the girls liking. I liked it because it tasted great with the crab dips. All and all. Great hang out spot on a great weather day!"}
{"text":"This is always my go-to spot to work mid-week. Grab a flight of some of the best beers in Charlotte and a sandwich just to pass the time. The atmosphere is amazing for a chill work space.   But, that is nothing in comparison to the weekends. Bring your dog, bring your kids - hell - bring your grandparents. This place is for everyone on the weekends.   If you're into craft beer and a good time, you need to be here on a Saturday afternoon when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"The bones of this brewery are classic in the pint-lifting sense: vaulted ceilings, lots of group seating, plenty of open space, three sizes available for all brews. I'd have not been super surprised to run into a few modern vikings here, arms akimbo, toasting into the night.   Alas, this remains modern day North Carolina, where the breweries don't work the wee hours and where vikings aren't often in line to tread: we sauntered in here for roughly the last thirty minutes of open they had going down, and that was that. It's worth mentioning that the OMB offerings are pretty terrific by many microbrew standards, and I sipped my way through a couple of different sizes in the brief time we had. Definitely worth a gulp if you find yourself nearby."}
{"text":"Dropped in from a business trip per Yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel and I'm super impressed. Did not expect to see such a large establishment when I pulled up. There's live jazz music outside and a cigar vendor set up in the beer garden area. Classy place. Food was on point. Had the hot roast beef sandwich and I loved it. Fries were a little salty, but tasted great (I also feel I tend to taste more salt in things than some ppl). Sandwich could use a little sauce on it, but I'm a sucker for sauces. Have only had the Mecktoberfest and Southside Weiss so far and they've been great paired with my food. Very mild and easy. Thumbs up for OMB!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Sunday and loved the atmosphere but the service left a LOT to be desired. Getting waited on in the bar was a trial, we had to get up and ask for everything ourselves or flag down anyone passing by to place any orders.  We enjoyed the wings, they were delicious and the burgers were decent but I think next time we go we will stay outside in the self serve area.  It would have been nice if there had been some kind of first timers guide on the communal tables explaining how things worked or if they had flags to hold up when you need service."}
{"text":"This place has poor beer choices. Then made last call at 11. We along with many others walked next door for one drink. Returned before 12 only to find or cars had been locked into the parking lot with a chain around the gate. There are no signs to let patrons know. Then employees leaving work cane out and taunted us and all the others. Saying they made last call already as if that had anything to do with locking cars in. We politely asked if there were parking lot hits posted that we had missed and we we yelled at that the brewery hours are on the website. I recommend avoiding this place if possible. Poor beers, rude staff and they will lock your car in the moment they close with no signs or notice. So many great breweries in Charlotte. Please don't waste your time here. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lots of people like their Copper, but I actually prefer their pilsner, Cap'n Jack. I love their brats with sauerkraut and spicy mustard. Their spicy mustard is pretty much the best mustard I've ever eaten....   Their beer cheese, maybe not the best, so get the pretzel with the mustard. :)   They recently moved locations just down the street from their old building and it's incredibly spacious and a huge outdoor patio and grassy area. I think I've seen a food truck out there before too.   Love OMB!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the beer and ambiance, one star for NO food available because of the too large crowd. I'll come back another day to try the food and be hopeful for a better experience."}
{"text":"I currently live fairly close to here but hadn't gone so I decided to meet a couple of friends to check out the Christkindlmarkt. I feel like my expectations were definitely too high. There were very few vendors and nothing of any quality or interest to me. Maybe they had a better selection earlier in the day? I tried some of there mulled wine which could have used some serious sieving but was otherwise fairly tasty. I got a kielbasa dog with potato salad to snack on and while okay I wasn't blown away. I hear they beer is great but I haven't tried it yet, nor did I make it inside. So I shall be back to give it another shot but for now I will leave it with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Super impressed! What a great new venue and fun to be had by all!  My husband, pup, and I made a casual stop on a sunny Saturday afternoon. This was the place to be! There were lots of pups, families, couples, and groups of friends taking advantage of the day.   There is indoor seating with tvs and table food service. While outside, there is a little pop-up bar and food truck station (their own brand). There are about 3 corn holes set up. There is a grassy area for your pup with complimentary doggie bags. Also, if you want to bring your own picnic blanket, do so. Plenty of families were setting up blankets. As you can tell, I was very impressed by the overall atmosphere.   If you are lucky enough to bike there, they have bike racks ready for you.   Order local brew, get some tasty bites, and have a terrific time here!"}
{"text":"I've mostly been there a lot mostly sometimes on Friday, the place is really awesome. I like the pretzel and club sandwich. And the food comes fast!"}
{"text":"Love going to OMB for beer and/or dinner with friends. This is my favorite spot to hang with friends and grab a beer mainly because of the atmosphere. The outdoor area is packed with picnic tables and outdoor spots to grab a beer or pretzel. Inside, there is a restaurant which is first come first serve. It's pretty difficult to find a spot inside to eat so we usually just end up sitting outside and grabbing a pretzel. The food is good in the restaurant. I have had the chicken club which was good although the bun was pretty soggy when I got it. The fries are okay, I've had better. My husband had the margherita pizza - the crust was flavorful and had a nice crisp. It was a bit soggy in the middle but he enjoyed it and would order it again. I love that you can bring your dog with you to the outdoor area as we always feel guilty about leaving ours at home."}
{"text":"Solid beer, great atmosphere, good German food. Gorgeous nite. Very fun place!"}
{"text":"Largest brewery in Charlotte. They offer a true German beer garden feel. Plenty of seating outside. They bring in live music sometimes outside, food trucks in case you get hungry and corn hole. They have a bar outside but make sure you venture inside as well. They do brewery tours on Saturday and its worth doing! They give you a free beer right out of the tap and I learned a lot. I love that they serve beer in the proper glassware!!"}
{"text":"Must have the Hornets Nest if you enjoy a good hefeweizen try the Hornets Nest.  Also had the bratwurst and bratkartoflen."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm agreeing more and more with the people who say that OMB should stick to the purity laws for their staple beers and offer more of a variety of other beers.  The reason the purity laws began in the first place was so that brewers wouldn't add a whole bunch of filler and cheap ingredients to their beer.  Now, when microbreweries add stuff to a beer, it's for flavor, not filler.  I know most of the local breweries get along well, but people are almost always going to go where there are more choices. I'm not necessarily inclined to always go back to OMB for the same 3-5 beers I've already had. I say they should offer their \"pure\" beers and start experimenting with others."}
{"text":"Best brewery in town. Not the best beer, not the best food, but the best overall. The patio is unbeatable, the beer is spectacular, their food selection needs work but that's literally the only complaint."}
{"text":"Second stop of our self created brewery crawl !!  At times we felt embarrassed to say that we haven't tried OMB brewery being in charlotte for such a long time.  finally the curse is broken and we stepped into this place of myth.  turns out its true what they say about OMB brewery, LOL. Amazing seating inside and outside, if you go in the evening it will make you wonder how awesome it would make you feel if you come in the morning or noon on a sunny day.  Huge seating inside and we hardly waited to get a table for ourselves.  Just as you enter the door, to the left is the bar area, with some stools where people stood around and were having their beers.  There is a half wall between the bar area and seating area where you get your food and beer served. Just like any first-timer we order a flight of 6 different beers and I honestly loved them all.  Most favorite was Southside Weiss ( I am spoiled by unfiltered beers).  Wife did like few of them and not much the other ones.  Please see the photo for names of all beers we tried. The Food - just to take it easy we ordered hummus with pita and pretzel with beer cheese.  Seriously you wouldn't expect hummus to be so tasty in a \"brewery\".  Great food, we did not have their entrees but the menu looked yummy and promising for sure. Cool place with large seating and bar area and we saw people coming in with their kids for dinner.  Felt more like a restaurant than a brewery at that point but again who am I to define what a brewery should be ;)"}
{"text":"Ok so today we went there and the lady was not to be mean but stupid. She hopefully hasn't been working here that long but the service was awful she kept handing out incorrect drinks and everyone got the wrong food the only reason i gave them three stars is because the food is really good. But the service there was horrible don't know if I'll be going back. Also not a fan of the seat your self."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite brewery in the city. Thr atmosphere, food, and the beer are all amazing. My favorite food is the salmon pita who would have thought a German Brewery would have a great pita.  There's yoga on Tuesday for $8, the price did increase however it still comes with a beer/soda."}
{"text":"I just recently realized that it had been several years since I reviewed OMB, and they have undergone many changes in the meantime, so I figured that I would update my review.  OMB is a traditional German brewery that is located on Yancy Rd., just down the street from their old location. This new location is quite nice, and much larger than their old digs... The inside is set up with a beautiful bar with lots of dark wood, and shelves highlighting all of their miscellaneous glassware. The dining area is set up with picnic tables with  bench seating, creating a nice cozy feel that encourages conversation with other customers.  The food is decent, but not great. Good enough to enjoy, but hardly worth a visit on its own merit.  The service is pretty good, the servers seem to work in teams to make sure that no one is overlooked. I have very seldom had my glass get completely empty before a server checks in to see what beer I would like next.  The beer, which is the highlight of every visit, is terrific. As I mentioned before OMB is well known for making traditional German beers. They have a fairly wide selection great beers, ranging from their flagship a Dusseldorf style Altbier, to great seasonal beers like Mecktoberfest, Fruh Bock. I have seldom had a beer from there that I did not like, but if you are looking for the same tired old IPA that everyone else seems to love, you will be out of luck here."}
{"text":"First, I have to agree with other reviews about the lack of bar seating.  I stop in here occasionally after work and also do not want to take up space at a table.  Standing at the bar just feels awkward.  The beer may be brewed by using the German purity standards, but those 500 year old laws do not carry as much weight in the current craft beer boom.  There are plenty of breweries that add items for flavor; I am sure none of the other craft breweries are using filler ingredients.  Not only that, the German purity laws were not solely implemented for purity.  Brewers were using wheat and rye to make beer but people need those ingredients for bread.  There is nothing wrong with making a wheat or rye beer (or as the Brewdogs did - made a beer with none of the German purity law ingredients).The laws also really limits their selection.  I like to try new beers and OMB has only had five the last few times I went there.  Unfortunately, none are really my preference but I did like the stronger Copper they had on their 6th anniversary.  There is a reason why American brewers and craft bars and breweries are doing quite well in Germany these days (the purity law was repealed in 1987).  They have expanded their menu and the food is decent, but I wouldn't go here solely with the intent of dining.  Personal pizzas are fresh and the dough is made with Copper.  My sister-in-law asked what sides were vegetarian and was told the sauerkraut was; it's not.  The service is also weird.  I had 4 people tell me they would be serving me even after I had a beer sitting in front of me.  It makes the place look disorganized.  I am also not a fan of having to give someone a card at the beginning of a meal and them walking away with it when I want to pay cash.  They also get dinged for only offering a limited menu if you're outside, even when the doors are wide open.  It makes no sense,  The beer may be fresh at OMB, but to me there are so many other breweries in Charlotte offering better beer and more options.  I respect OMB for leading the way, but it probably won't be first on my list to visit anymore"}
{"text":"The Pilsner was delicious--surprisingly flavorful, yet still light and refreshing. The brat, potato salad, and kraut were good--and if I was well versed in German food I'd be a better judge, but the kraut was really strong--I barely ate mine. Cool setting with great outdoor hangout area, too--this was my first visit and I'll gladly come back to try their other selections. Good job OMB!"}
{"text":"I fought the pouring rain to find this place close to the train tracks. It doesn't look promising from the outside; less like a brewery and more like a meat packing plant where dreams go to die. I wasn't sure which door to go to, so I wrongly picked the one closest to my car. I found myself in a big empty space with what looked like some kind of class going on. Luckily, someone pointed me to the restaurant portion on the other side of the wall.  As much as this place is basically a warehouse, they do a good job on the interior. It is surprisingly welcoming with a ton of dark wood, long tables, German flags hanging from the rafters, and panels on the walls to deaden the noise. I've never been to Germany, but as far as German beer halls go, this one feels right.  The room is accentuated by two gigantic windows that gaze upon the brewing operation, which looks quite large from outside. It's probably the best option I've seen as far as giving visitors a glimpse of the brewing equipment without having it all up in their faces or in the way. And the restaurant didn't smell like brewery, so they must do a good job containing odors to the back.  The menu is a little limited; it features sausages imported from around the country and sides that can be prepared at the start of the day. I'm guessing they don't really have any cooking equipment in the back. I opted for two sausages - gyulai and knockwurst - and two sides. The sausages were excellent, and the sides were pretty on-point.  Fair warning - if you don't like vinegar, don't order the German sides.  As for the beer, it is clean and crisp and a damned good representation of the German style. If you don't like simple beers made with quality ingredients - if you must have 10 different malts and 60 plus IBUs - this is not your scene. There's beauty to be found in a well-done lager, though, as there's nothing to hide mistakes.  Everything is tasty, but my favorites were the dopplebocks. Then again, that's my favorite style to begin with. And taking it to the next level, they had one of their higher ABV bocks available aged in bourbon barrels. Also my favorite. The beer could have used a little less time in the barrels, as I thought the bourbon stole the show instead of adding a layer of complexity, but it was still damn good.  The one negative comment I have is the service, and it wasn't the servers fault. Somebody must have called in sick, because on a Saturday near lunch time they only had two servers and a busser working the giant room. As such, I had to flag people down whenever I wanted something. But once I did, they were friendly and quick.  Overall, I'd be back if I lived nearby, both for some sausage and some bock. Well done."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Beer was okay. Nothing really blew me away but I do really enjoy their copper. The atmosphere was very cool but to get a table you pretty much have to fend for your self which sucks. I at the Ruben which was pretty good. We had a sausage sampler which I would definitely  reccomend. Our server Joe was great as well. Overall it was good and we will return I just would like more exciting beers."}
{"text":"Great brewer with traditional German beer, with a twist. I had their unique porter and an American style brat- yum! I am from the craft brewing capital, so it's nice to find a gem like this while traveling. OMB was a great find and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came to the new location for dinner with family and the inside was gorgeous. I have nothing to compare it to as I never went to the old location but the new is fabulous. I have had their beers before various places around the city and I like them fine.  Their food was pretty bland in my opinion. It wasn't terrible it just wasn't that great. I did a build your own pizza with caramelized onions, mozzarella and some peppers. The dough was a bit thick for my taste and the flavor of the toppings was just lacking a bit.  I would go here again to hang out and drink beer but not so much for a meal."}
{"text":"Hard to give this place anything higher when I essentially ate a food truck bratwurst. It was okay but that's it. It wasn't hot but was warm. Sauerkraut was just okay. My pretzel was good but the cheese sauce was again just ok. The best part of both meals was the mustard. Next time I would order from the kitchen.   Now the place itself is pretty cool. It's huge. Picnic tables end to end. Sun or shade. Tonight was yoga night and there were a ton of people there for that. The beer is good. Really good.   I'll return but not for dinner. But it's definitely a place to spend hours with friends and cold beer."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Very inattentive, not aware of table maintenance or checking in on the guest. Caught staff talking several times and standing around. They seemed to be busy, but it wasn't in a productive way.   If the staff awareness and service improved, I would enjoy this place a lot more."}
{"text":"Let's call this unremarkable. First visit ever, and on a Wednesday afternoon. With very few customers.  Beer - not bad, but not great and only 5 different ones on tap?  For a brewery this big in this day and age we expected more variety. I get it that they do huge crowds, and keeping the choices to a minimum probably fits the Biergarten model better (have been to the Hofbrau house in Munich, so I understand, as they only offered 2 beer varieties in liter mugs).  We only had a pretzel to eat, which was not warm, pretty small, and the beer cheese sauce was runny. (BIG salty pretzels make people drink more beer, hello...!).  Waitstaff was the highlight.  We ended up down the street at Sugar Creek, which has a much larger and high quality beer selection.  If you want a huge October fest feel, maybe it's for you, else there are several choices in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential Charlotte brewery.  They have a very large indoor space  with an ample bar and you also get service at the tables. The covered patio also includes table service.  They have an excellent outdoor space and often have music or activities on the weekends.  It's a great brewery for adults... and it's very kid friendly.  The beer is very good, one of my favorites is their seasonal Oktoberfest.  You can't go wrong with Copper either.  They also have wonderful food! Pretzels are a must here, and their wursts are always juicy and delicious.  I usually get spaetzel as a side, one of my faves you don't see on menus too often.  My kids love to eat here too, usually gobble down the kiderwurst in no time.  Great food and atmosphere!  I am so looking forward to going to their location in Cornelius.... even though it's going to be a little while."}
{"text":"A love story.  Dear OMB,  You have a special place in my heart. You took my Charlotte brewery virginity three years ago, yet I keep coming back to you. Your staple Copper beer is delicious, but I love your Octoberfest- sorry I mean- MECKtoberfest even more. I wish you had it all year round, but that's what makes it special. Thank you for offering your delicious bavarian pretzels with beer cheese when I'm in a desperate need of one too. Sometimes I drink too many of your beers and need something to hold me over. I still miss your small brewery down the street, but I understand we all grow up and need to move to big, newer things. I'll be back soon, but keep the same charm and never change your signature taps. They make you-YOU.  Prost!"}
{"text":"Big and open area with lots of picnic tables inside and out. Order beer and food at the bar. Simple menu and ok beer. I would return for the atmosphere, but not for the beer or food."}
{"text":"The club sandwich was decent, I hate that they had such a small area for eating outside that didn't require you to serve yourself. I absolutely hate walking into a restaurant that has no direction or employees to let you to seat yourself. At the very least I would think employees wouldn't just walk by you as you stand there waiting to be served. Overall it's a beautiful location but I probably wouldn't go back as I'm not a huge beer drinker."}
{"text":"I came into town for one night for work. I was looking for a place to have a good beer and was craving some wings. This place was much much more than a beer and wing place. It's a full on brewery so no need to worry about beer (Southwside Weiss pictured). They also had wings but a much better menu than that. They had a full German menu, pretzels, sauerkraut, sausage, you name it. I settled for the hot wings and they were crispy, enough sauce, and enough hot to enjoy. I usually sweat to super hot foods but didn't to this, however, I enjoyed them. This place didn't disappoint and would be super cool on a warm summer day in the beer garden"}
{"text":"2.5 stars...pretty mediocre honestly in all respects. Been here a couple times, not too excited about their food or drink but great place to hang out with friends. Nothing really prompts a review but insider tip...TERRIBLE SERVICE.   This is a place frequented by a lot of people and several have commented on the lack of service as well. I understand these are completely subjective reviews but I think a couple of the previous reviews hit the nail on the head. To me if several people had very similar experiences it should be strongly considered.  We had three different servers over the course of 2 hours. We went for the panthers Seahawks game, and surprisingly it was not crowded - it has been much busier during previous visits. Our main server came over for our initial drink order. And did not return unless we happened to luckily catch her attention. And when we did she acted like it was a problem that we were bothering her to ask for something. Didn't get a refill on my soft drink. Wasn't asked. After waiting for 20 mins to get the check our friend had to go to the bar to pay her check.   Sorry for burdening you with your job. When we ended up finally paying our check she took it without a word, but an eye roll.   Come on ole meck!! As a part of the Charlotte community I expected a lot more from you guys. We were rooting for you! Brought some friends from out of town and was not a good first impression for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cool spot for a cold glass of beer and some amazing pretzels. The patio is huge and better suited for cool nights and fall days.   We came for lunch on a Sunday (brunch for those true southerners) and just assumed they would have a brunch setup but they do not. Despite the lack of a brunch menu the place was packed inside.   Food was good, especially the pretzels with beer cheese. Burgers are ginormous as well as the personal pizzas. The beer comes cold and icy (and I think a little stronger). We will return in the fall to enjoy the patio, fire pits and music."}
{"text":"First, let me recommend that you read Amanda F's review.  She is right on with her description.  So, I'll fill in from there.  The menu isn't extensive, but for a brew hall, it is just fine!  Several appetizers, sandwiches, and other items.  We recently visited OMB for a birthday \"gathering\" and everything we had from the menu was excellent!  We tried the pretzel and the Meat and Cheese tray to start.  Then we ordered a variety of sandwiches, all of which were quite good!   The beer... so Copper is my favorite, but since I was IN the brewery, I decided to try some of the other OMB brews.  They offer a flight of four samples for $4.  I really enjoyed several of them.  Copper is still my favorite, but I'll enjoy some of the others occasionally too!  Service was excellent!  There was live entertainment outside in the Biergarten which had a respectable crowd gathering too!  All in all, it was a very good time, good food, great service, and terrific beer!!"}
{"text":"The venue, the food and beer were all even better than I expected.  I was in town for business and so wished I had my entire family including my dog with me to experience this unique restaurant.  The atmosphere was welcoming to families as well as a group of adults out for an evening.  Really enjoyed the beer sampler & Italian panini.  Wish they had a restaurant like this everywhere!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Great selection of local German-inspired craft beers!  Delicious food to eat inside or outside in the huge beer garden.  Family-friendly :)"}
{"text":"A great space. I have come here for birthday parties, networking events and pop up markets. They have an awesome outdoor patio area, just wish there was a little more lighting because once it's dark it's hard to see the people you are chatting with.   They have wine, and since I don't drink beer, I appreciate that. They also have great food. Usually there are also food trucks there too.  Definitely check out their special events like holiday pop up markets, etc."}
{"text":"Great brewery in Charlotte. The tap room reminds you of something you would see in Germany with the vaulted ceilings and iron chandeliers. I am a big fan of their seasonal beers...especially Mecktoberfest. They have it now and you need to get it as soon as possible. It is easy to drink and has a great full flavor. Just do it. They have live music on Friday nights during the summer. It is so nice to sit out side and listen to music while having 1 or 5 beers. Always a good time!"}
{"text":"OMB is one of my favorite places to go and day drink on a nice day with hubs and the pup. They have ample indoor/outdoor seating and refreshing beers and mixed beer drinks. Their wings are literally my favorite in all of Charlotte. Meaty and delicious! (Get your head outta the gutter). It's also close to Sugar Creek, Queen Park Social, Broken Spoke, and Good Road Ciderworks. Perfect for bar hopping!   The one downfall is the place is SO big that if you want to sit outside without a server, you're limited to the bar menu. There's also not a lot of games to play for such a huge brewery. But they do have a bar outside and usually a food truck serving their limited menu items."}
{"text":"Great craft beer and a friendly & knowledgable staff. Not overly hopped up, but not light either, just enjoyable. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place to get some brew. The tour was basic and informative (given by a volunteer local beer brewing enthusiast). The brewery is a fun thing to do and a great place to take a visitor to enjoy some beer. The sad part was that there was no free sample after the tour which was kind of a let down.   The tap room is nice. High ceiling, i'm guessing those were German flags in the rafters, a nice long corner bar and plenty of servers.   They only had 2 beers on tap at the moment (a third being tapped soon) i did enjoy the Copper more than the other choice.   $3.50 for a pint."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brewery's in Charlotte. They have expanded their beer lineup. All the new additions are excellent. From what I have heard the staff goes to Munich, Germany regularly in order to capture the key elements of German Brewery. I have been to Munich and OMB feels like a great German Brewery."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of things going for it. For one, it's a huge establishment and it has that olde castle feel to it. The decor is wooden stools, barrels, wooden tables, olde rustic lights and hunter decor. I felt like Gaston from beauty and the beast...  The food was a mix of German and European food blended with American. (If that's a thing). I honestly didn't eat and drink as much as I wanted to, I was with a group of 30 that easily was mixed in with no trouble, but we had things like a huge pretzel with beer cheese (so soft and rich) the wings were super singly bad ass, it was a bbq mix spicy concoction. Plenty of locally crafted beers, the Hefeweizen was my fav.  Overall a good experience, the staff was also super friendly. We stayed till closing, and not once did they ask us to leave, they went about closing duties until we got the hint.  I would have liked to try more of the cuisine so I can only give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service.  Looks like it would be a fun place to come at any time of the year whether you drink beer or not.  Staff looked after us whether they were out waiter or not.  Definitely a great place to go.  Even pet friendly.  A guy had his Lab inside sitting next to his table."}
{"text":"Excellent Beer now available to Charlotte residents! Ask for it on tap at your favorite bars and restaurants.   From the brewery's website: \"The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery (OMB) is now brewing and delivering premium quality, thoroughly refreshing German style beer right here in Charlotte. Look for us at your local establishment.\""}
{"text":"Love OMB! You must get a Captn Jack and a pretzel with beer cheese as soon as you get here! Great food, love the atmosphere also!"}
{"text":"We are new to living in the Charlotte area, and discovered Olde Mecklenburg Brewery on a mini-excursion to explore South End.  We loved the space and the beer, but the food options in the Biergarten weren't exactly what we were looking for.    We arrived around 1:00 pm on 11/4/17.  There was ample parking when we got there, but by the time we left, the crowds arrived.  People were scrambling for spots, including at the \"extra parking\" next door.  We considered ourselves lucky to time it right.    Walking in from around the back, the outdoor Biergarten at OMB is very welcoming, and huge.  Seating was available everywhere, such that if the place really did fill up, I have no idea where people would park.  An oak log smoldered in the enormous fire kettle, soon to be a great burning flame when the wood was restocked.  We went to see about getting a table inside, but it was loud and crowded, and we wanted to enjoy a warm fall afternoon before the weather turns.  (We are Pittsburgh transplants, and even though people tell me I'll love the winters here, I remain skeptical).  Outside happy people were scattered around the picnic tables with a lot of dogs.  One of the things I can't get used to in Charlotte is how people take their dogs everywhere, and they're welcome to do so!  At OMB, the Biergarten had multiple pet waste stations stocked with bags, and we enjoyed watching people roll in with their fur babies.  Being from a less dog-friendly area, we don't even consider bringing our dog with us.  We need to remember this!  Outside, they have their own food truck set up where one can go and order from a limited menu of largely pretzels, some brats, and burgers.  I ordered a cheeseburger, which though it came as an enormous beef patty, it wasn't particularly great.  Wife ordered the currywurst, which while she loved the curry sauce, she wasn't enamored with the sausage either.  I'd call the food serviceable, but not a reason to go.  The beer, on the other hand, was very very good.  Ordering beer outside was a lot like getting food at Au Bon Pain.  We walked up to the bar, pick our drafts, then shuffled down the line to the register to check out.  Not the usual way of getting beer, but I'm not complaining.  In the last three months as I've visited, OMB Copper has become a good option for a local beer when dining out.  (I never expected Charlotte to be a bigger beer town than Pittsburgh, yet here we are).  Since I've had my share of Coppers, I went with their newly-available dunkel for fall.  I've always been a fan of the dunkels up north, and as such, I thought this one could have had a bit more of a malty flavor to it, but that's nitpicking.    Overall, we think it would be a great place to go hang out for a while, and I can only imagine how much fun it would be on a nice summer evening.  We look forward to going back, trying some more varieties of beer, and sampling the food from the indoor restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the home some of the best craft beer in Charlotte.  At Olde Meck, it is obvious that the focus is on quality as it is evident in every brew.  You won't find more than 4 or 5 beers on draft but they are all tasty.  Each one is served in the appropriate drinking vessel for that variety of beer. \"Copper\" is the signature beer and you'll find it not only here but also at many bars around town.    The atmosphere at the brewery is heavily influenced by German beer halls.  While it does its best to be true to the German style, it's a bit bland if you ask me. I prefer the cozy and lively NoDa or Birdsong when it comes to the design.  Of note, they are building a whole new location that should be opening soon.  Very excited to see that!  There are some food options including bratwurst and pretzels.  They stay true to the German influence in the menu.  The brats are really good, and the other food is pretty average.  It is a plus that they are able to offer food, as some other local breweries are not.  They offer free tours throughout the day, which is a really nice touch as well. There are also lots of events that take place at the brewery which really brings out the community in full force!  Bottom line, Olde Meck is the stalwart brewery in the QC!"}
{"text":"I really like it there. It's a really nice, really clean local brew house. The beer is good. The people are nice, but then again, I would be happy too if I worked there. I picked up my first GROWER and I love it. I am hooked."}
{"text":"Cool place. Would definitely like to come back for food next time I'm in Charlotte. This time I just got a 7 oz Radler. Really enjoyed it.   Inside had bar area and eating area with wait service for food and beer. Lots of room and nice a cool inside.   Outside is big spacious area with lots of Punic table to sit at. It's all self service. Bar to get beer. There was also a food truck, corn hole, and live music. Some people also had their dogs.   Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"OMB was terrific - tons of parking around and a big outdoor space for friends and family! Lots of pups too.  The cherry cider was delicious and we didn't have to wait long for our food (food truck). Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I planned a couple's Stock the Bar shower here with a friend of mine and overall we think the event was a success! Thanks to their beautiful new space, delicious brews, and brewery tour, the guests had a pretty good time! Really, REALLY love their new space! They did an amazing job.  The food that we ordered ended up being just right even though we were a little worried about the menu they provided for us to choose from for our party. The Chef came out to deliver some of the items and I always think it's a great touch when the Chef comes to check on you.   One star was knocked off for service. Although the servers were really nice and Gina the manager, was phenomenal, seriously, VERY accommodating... they kept switching servers on us- like 3 times and for a party of 18-20 it was very confusing for our guests. Had we had 3 servers helping us the whole time it would have been one thing, but we had one server for an hour, then another server, than another at the end. I chalk this up to them just getting accustom to the new space though. I am sure there are some growing pains that have gotten or will get worked out.    Although we didn't need to use it because our party was more casual and smaller, their event space seems awesome for an event too! Highly recommend looking into it if you're planning an event!"}
{"text":"This brewery has turned into a daycare/playground. There is no drinking without a baby's cry or a child's scream. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn by Olde Meck. Awesome location, awesome indoor/outdoor areas, great food, but I just cannot get on board with the beers! I really enjoy trying different types of beers, but I have never gotten excited about an Olde Meck offering. Love going there though. Set up like a traditional German bierhaus, there are long picnic tables in the main dining areas, a bar with a few televisions, some private event rooms and large doors opening out to the biergarten area.  Definitely a fun place to go hang out with friends, and they also have surprisingly good food. Most of the menu items are German and German-inspired, keeping with the theme."}
{"text":"The new brewery is great in the warmer weather as they have so much space and fun outside, but in winter it is incredibly loud and seating runs short with everyone cramped inside. Not normally a huge deal for me, but combined with the fact that they typically only have about 6 beers on tap (only 2 of which I don't mind drinking) Olde Meck just falls short of the other brewerys in the area. I go here when a group of friends wants to, but I suggest other places when I have the choice. Just not a huge fan of the few beer options they offer, taste wise. I love going to brewerys for the craft beer experience as well and you simply don't get that here. If they were to create a few new brews I'd be interested in hitting this spot more often to try again, especially once it warms up and we can enjoy all new outdoor space. If you go for the food tho, its pretty good but when its crowded service in s pretty slow."}
{"text":"If you drive along South Tryon towards downtown from South Charlotte, this is a hard to miss the eye! Their parking is humongous! - one time I was even mentioning to my friend OMB parking is comparable to Costco's! Once you enter inside the compound, you get this amazing breath of fresh chilled beer - the atmosphere itself is great with lots of benches and trees. For a moment, took me back to the nostalgic childhood days of playing under big shady trees. There was a German restaurant with a huge door - it was completely packed on a Saturday evening. It's self seating inside, so if you are lucky, you would get a table. Outside there is a beer tap counter and a small pretzel cabin at the other end that sells freshly backed pretzels and pizza. The beer is cheap and great - I wished they had a sampler tray with all the beers. Get a beer, get some fresh pretzels or pizza and enjoy you evening under the shades with lots of friendly people!"}
{"text":"I had HIGH hopes for the OMB in its new location. I've enjoyed coming to OMB to participate in Yoga on Tap and always enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe at the old location. However, I visited the new location over Labor Day weekend and didn't experience the same treatment as I did at the old location. The layout is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean, the grass is green, but the service is TERRIBLE.   I was sitting inside with about 6 other people. It took 15 minutes to get someone even to notice that we were sitting there (the place wasn't even that crowded). After asking 3 people if could get some help, a very pleasant woman came by and helped us. We all ordered flights (4 smaller beers that give you the opportunity to taste a variety). When the beers finally arrived a different server brought them....totally fine, but she didn't know who ordered what and she didn't even know what beers were in each flight. So none of us even got what we had ordered. Then we ordered food and all of our orders were wrong. I was very disappointed and a little embarassed since I brought friends there from out of town.   My advice to you --- save yourself some time and head over to Triple C, NoDa Brewery or any other lovely brewery Charlotte has to offer. I'll give OMB a few months to smooth out those kinks before returning back."}

{"text":"Awesome German beer hall atmosphere, and great German beers!!  This place is great, definitely worth stopping by and having a beer or  three."}
{"text":"Went to OMB for their Mecktoberfest event on Saturday. While the constant drizzle certainly kept people away, it was still pretty crowded. They had the place set up a bit differently than last. Changes for the good. Parking $5, no entry fee and once you started a tab, you go add to the tab at any point of sale---inside bat, servers, food station, beer truck etc. that made it nice. ( now if they can figure out an app so you can close out your tab from your phone, that would be pretty smart). All beers were $6 and served in a glass mug (I think 16 oz beers). The food station never got crazy busy and they were staffed to get you served quickly. I had an American style bratwurst, cucumber salad and a delicious pretzel with beer cheese. All was as expected except the beer cheese needed something more to it. I don't really drink a lot of beer so my opinion isn't worth much. I had the Copper and Capt Jack--they were good as beer goes for me. They have several TVs with various college games on-clearly not a focal point but it was nice to peek at scores and they had several bands playing outside throughout the day. Overall, a great event just too bad the weather dampened the day."}
{"text":"Oh. Wow, there's breweries in Charlotte. Who knew?! Well, this was my first time here and was I surprised. When we first got here I noticed the nice wood fire they had going out in the front, but sadly we could not enjoy it because there was a lot of wind and smoke flying all over the place.   Going inside there was a lot of flags hanging down from the tall ceilings, which I really enjoyed, and in the back stood the brewery itself. I got a couple of drinks and sat down with my friends. During the middle of our discussion someone came up and asked us if we wanted to go on a tour of the brewery. Awesome.  So inside we got to see how they produce their beer and what their company stands for. \"Freshness\" and they honor this by saying that they only deliver their beer only 30 miles away from their brewery. So, according to them they don't like to put preservatives in their beer and that they go by that beer has an expiration date. In conclusion, the main points are these, they like fresh, only 30 miles of the brewery, and that's about it. So, this beer is exclusive to Charlotte.  In conclusion, my trip was okay. It wasn't amazing, however I did enjoy some of the beer I got the chance to drink from there and the vibe and I'll definitely come back for a hangout with my friends."}
{"text":"Olde Meck is by far the best brewery to go to in Charlotte. I try to hit it up just about any time I am in town. It is a must if you are visiting Charlotte for the first time!  The location/space is unbeatable. It's huge! Their outdoor beer garden probably has hundreds of tables. If the weather is nice, it is fantastic! Also, the inside is beautiful as well. It definitely has an old German theme going on.   Their beer probably isn't my favorite in Charlotte, but it will definitely get the job done. The Copper is their most popular beer. I don't love it, but I do like a few of their darker beers like the Dunkel. The Copper is a bit hoppy for my taste.. I don't love hoppy Ambers.   I have heard the food is also very good. I haven't actually had the food from inside even though I've been there so many times. I have had some from the truck they have outside and it was pretty solid.   We actually attended a wedding here once as well which was pretty cool. A brewery isn't a bad place to get hitched for sure! Especially if it is a bad ass brewery!"}
{"text":"The beer is great, the ambience is even better. But the service sucks. They always have a lot of events going on which can sometimes be fun but causes a ton of extra traffic and makes it hard to find parking"}
{"text":"We decided to do a tour of the breweries in Charlotte and OMB was our first stop. First off, let me say that the atmosphere is absolutely incredible! I For those that have expressed a distaste for it, they need to recognize that OMB modeled their tasting room after a German beer hall. I  love the large spacious inside and the picnic tables outside are a real treat for the beautiful North Carolina days. It's also great that they have a food selection,  as opposed to many other breweries. However, I imagine that this might make them less likely to have food trucks as I've seen so often at other breweries.   My major complaint with OMB was their beer selection and quality. I admire breweries with the balls to brew under the Reinheitsgebot, which is the German purity law allowing only water, barley, and hops. Provisional laws later allowed added yeast (at the time its role wasn't recognized in the brewing process despite its presence), wheat malt, and cane sugar. However, I truly feel that brewing under these requirements can stifle creativity and the flavor creations that can come from the use of other adjuncts. Despite trying their flight and sipping on a few, I was disappointed in their beer selection."}
{"text":"Nice microbrewery. Great food. Just know that the food comes out on of paper plates and plastic utensils. I would pay a dollar more for real plates and utensils. But it's okay as is."}
{"text":"Came here during a business trip, with coworkers. We'd received a recommendation for this as a local place where you could get food as well as beer. We sat inside so we could use the full menu; we'd been told that sitting outside gave you limited items, so I'm not sure that's so.  Parking is your first challenge. While there is a large lot in back, it was chock full when we arrived, with some people parking on pine needles off the pavement. We had to look to the street to find an available spot, but another local business also led to people parked on the street. The fact that we arrived after the work day may have exacerbated the problem.  The interior is a large beer hall, with a bar along one wall. Seating is at cafeteria-style tables, and there are no reservations. There are private rooms available, we saw a large party in one of them.  We arrived and stood at the bar, keeping our eyes peeled for people leaving their seats at a table while we sampled the brews before settling on our order. They can use a credit card to build a tab so whatever you order at the bar is tied to your meal order.  It is loud inside, with lots of talking and the close seating, but the food is excellent. We had a pretzel starter, and a couple of us had Pretzel Melt sandwiches. The German potato salad side is also excellent.  If you want German food in a German beer hall experience, this is the place to go. I tend to prefer sit-down German restaurants, myself; the loudness and informality of table seating are not my preference, and why I didn't give this five stars. As the food and beer were very good, I'll definitely return when I'm in the area, though."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner while traveling for work. The food was pretty blah and the beers standard - although they have a great variety. The place is huge and when I arrived it was seat yourself. Seemed to take a while to get service - don't know if that was cause it was a Tuesday night or what. I bet it's fun for just drinking but don't come here for a meal."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere and beer. Really love the Hornet's Nest Hefeweizen and Copper Amber Ale. Ordered a pretzel to compliment the beer and sorry to say it was \"fresh baked\" days ago and microwaved prior to it arriving to my perch at the bar. Piping hot, burned my fingers and grossly old.  Mustard us from a jar and beer cheese dipping sauce is bland.  Damn--I wanted a real pretzel with my beer!  Come parched to OMB, but you may want to BYOF..."}
{"text":"Small Microbrew but Big on heart...  I had the wonderful opportunity to be exposed to this brewery at the First Charlotte Elite Launch Event @ Customshop. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the lineup of beers from OMB. The quality, taste and finish of these beers makes me wish I was born in Bavaria!   This location is what heaven must be like. There is a brewery in the back and a nice beer garden in the front with massive ceiling but most importantly FREE BEER!   DISCLAIMER: Free beer is tomorrow and only found in heaven not at OMB.  I would recommend going with the Old Meck. It is a full body lager with a clean finish and robust taste. The staff here was busy but the service was impeccable. The owner was making the rounds checking on the customers. How many places have you gone in Charlotte and meet the dude who crafted your beer?  I think that two great Americans sum up my thoughts on beer...  \"Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\" - Ben Franklin  \"Alright Brain, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But lets just do this, and I can get back to killing you with beer.\" - Homer Simpson"}
{"text":"A nice and big outdoor area with plenty of seating, umbrellas for cover,  live music, food cart and great beers on tap.   Recommend burgers from food truck and copper ale for beer.  Inside is a sit down type environment, but we were able to get wings to take outside. Wings were very good,  mild as a small kick, but BBQ wings were the best.  Plenty of parking and overflow parking as well."}
{"text":"We stayed in Charlotte one night before a flight out and decided to check out the local flavor.  So glad we did! Yelp members never fail us when we are in unfamiliar surroundings.  This place is great! We were there on a Tuesday afternoon and in addition to the astheically pleasing biergarten there were about 100 people queuing for the weekly, \"Yoga On Tap.\" What a great community event! We shared a burger - which, was amazingly good, and a couple of great beers.  The weather, which was perfect for bench-sitting and enjoying the sights and sounds of all ages (and species - dogs are invited!), only enhanced the great beer and food offerings.  Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Why have I not been here sooner??  Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is great!  I went here last night with a friend, we did the tour and hung around for a few beers & a hot pretzel.    First, when you're on your way here, it feels like you're going the wrong way.  It's tucked back in this industrial area, warehouses, etc.  I started driving slower, turned down the music - you know, less music helps you look better - and thought I had made a wrong turn.  But then, boom, there it is!  They're actually moving up the street this summer, for a bigger brewing space.  (Grand opening here I come!)  It's really nice in the inside, ridiculously tall ceilings, flags hung up everywhere, a bunch of seat yourself tables.  The bar is small, but there are no stools, so it doesn't get crowded.  I had the Captain Jack pilsner, and the wheat beer.  Both were very good.  I prefer lighter beer (really, I prefer cider, haha) and these were great options for me.    I got there around 5:50pm, the tour started at 6pm.  They recommend that you come a little bit early to grab a beer before the tour starts.  (Free tour = no free beer on the tour). It was about an hour, interesting and funny.     Then. Oh my goodness then.  I was looking around a bit and saw a beautiful looking hot pretzel on someone else's table.  The decision to order the hot pretzel may have been my best decision all week.  It was so good!  Fresh. Perfect.  Mmmmm.  I'll be back for a beer or three, and I'll probably bring out of town friends here when they visit!"}
{"text":"We had such a great trip yesterday at the Old Meckleburg Brewery. The tour was fantastic the food was delicious and the beer....if it was fruit it would be fresh picked. I don't think we have ever had beer this fresh. We were shocked when we got our bill as it was about half of what we expected.  We will definitely be back while we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to hang out. They have a limited but awesome selection of beer that they brew at their location. They also have live menu and a cool food selection. The location is a little off the beaten path but definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I decided this would be a great way to spend a friend's birthday. I went on a Saturday and they have free brewery tours at 2pm, 3pm and 4pm. The information that was shared was interesting and the brewer conducting the tour was funny! It was HOT AS HELL in the brewery (Not in the tasting room, don't worry!) but the tour was only 15-ish minutes long. The food available is your typical bar pretzels and a couple more snacks.   I think OMB is great for get-togethers or just for date night!"}
{"text":"Authentic, German beer hall! The fella and I ventured in over Labor Day weekend, and the new spot was hoppin' on a Sunday afternoon.   The new location is HUGE with tons of parking, an outdoor biergarten with tons of umbrella-covered picnic tables and a food truck the day we were there. We ventured inside to the nice, cool brauhaus which came complete with long, family-style tables, a few single tables, and a comfy bench that ran along the side of the bar. In front of the bar was a ton of space with pub tables for standing.   This is definitely not the place to come if you're feeling anti-social since most of the seating lends itself to making new friends and sitting with strangers! There were also a ton of kids inside, and they were giving tours (on weekends only, I think) at 2:00, 3:00 and 4:00.  We didn't try any food, but what was coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled delicious. We opted for a flight, which let you try 4 of the 6 beers they had on tap.  The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars was the service. Our waitress, Fontanella, was awesome and was seriously workin' hard, but she needed more help. As of right now, their theory is that any waiter is your waiter, which can be great if they're all awesome or terrible if no one ever comes your way. Fontanella did her best to get to us consistently, but OMB was packed! Hopefully they'll get that little kink worked out, and all will be well.  She also said they're working on getting their free wi-fi up and running, but it'll be another week or so before that happens."}
{"text":"OMB is pretty much the original in town and their brewery/taproom/patio reflects that. The place is huge! Good beer, pretty good food (few styles of sausages, sandwiches, etc) and a really expansive patio with umbrellas and corn hole or a German style beer hall with long community tables inside. It's a 5* place but when its busy, its pretttty busy so getting a spot at a table inside or a server's attention can be slower than you may like.   Overall, a place you have to hang out at if in the area. It is located just south of SouthEnd and walking distance to Sugar Creek Brewing too if you want to hit two while close by."}
{"text":"Love coming to this brewery, especially in the winter time. They do an amazing winter market, complete with tons of local vendors selling high quality goods just in time for the holiday season. Don't support Amazon, come to this place and shop small!  Additionally, it's just a great place to bring your family (human or canine) and hang out inside (human only) or outside (humans and canines welcome) and munch on German food, drink delicious beer, and enjoy time together. This place has exactly what you need and nothing extra.   They also do events here. Could be an awesome spot for a company function or a wedding rehearsal dinner. I've seen nice catering come in too."}
{"text":"I had the \"brat in a bun\" for lunch today and it was delish!!!"}
{"text":"Tremendous new space and tremendous intentions do not translate into a tremendous experience.  Background: Been drinking craft beer since the late 80s rebirth, OMB from the outset of its founding. Still have an original growler somewhere. Yet this new brauhaus -- roughly down the street from the old -- has to go in the disappointment checkbox. And for the oddest of reasons.  It seems someone has elevated a parody of Teutonic aloofness and detachment to the new OMB standard. How else to explain menus, walls, anything devoid of info on the beers? The single POS station for a huge space? The frazzled servers just trying to make do rather than make good? Just not a good vibe.  It starts with staffing. If you are gonna have table service inside a space of this size you need a minimum of four waiters and four bussers/runners -- great that you have a guy floating around to \"explain\" the beers, but if you'd PRINT THAT info somewhere (and it looked like there was as empty space in the menus where that shoulda been on the Sunday afternoon we visited) then you can stick him back behind the bar.  Stress on the wait staff was evident from the dropped orders (my German potato salad I was really looking forward to got morphed into the house-made potato CHIPS, which are awesome and evil, but still) and the lost beer refill sales.  And the beer. Look, I love fresh, local craft beer. But. Somewhere along the way OMB has decided to up the malt and cut the hops. The beers are almost universally too sweet and flat -- at least this batch. The Mecktoberfest remains a decent take on the style, but maybe the move has jarred the output. Either that or stale kegs are not getting dumped in time -- dunno the exact deal, but overall the beer was only meh to good when it should be outstanding across the board.  What was outstanding? The German fare on the menu. Shockingly so. A brat that was actually cooked properly -- a little char, firm and rendered thru to the middle; not burnt and raw -- and crazy pretzel parts. Do start with a pretzel app ($3.50) to nosh, but skip the beer cheese add-on ($5.25) which was universally judged less interesting than the mustard, and save almost $2. The pretzel melt was high at $10 (Black forest ham, Swiss cheese & spicy mustard served in between a soft pretzel) but damn good. In retrospect, order a pretzel and two of the melts and a party of four can nosh and drink a good long, happy time.  Less successful was the Southwest turkey wrap ($9) primarily because the smoked chili sauce was insanely hot. A mystery on our visit -- all the wing options were X-ed out. Fine. But the takeaway remains -- go German on the munchies.  This space remains tremendously popular, even if I do not quite know why. Might be sustainable for a long time at current quality levels. Might not. I'll give it another go in a few months regardless."}
{"text":"A couple weeks late, but this place still deserves another review!  I'm from Chicago and was visiting my boyfriend who's a Charlotte local, we decided to make our own brew tour and spend Saturday at local breweries. We started at Old Mecklenberg. The inside is a huge, open space with German beer hall style seating (long benches). Even though it was busy, we sat down and were served right away. We tried almost every beer offered, all were really good, but the unfiltered wheat was my favorite. We also ordered food.. Which was fresh, and came out fast. Just a disclaimer: when you order something with a pretzel bun.. It is literally served between a warm pretzel.. And it's amazing!  I can't wait to return to Old Mecklenberg, especially now that the weather is warming up.. It would be nice to drink on their patio and play some corn hole. Definitely recommend this brewery wether you're a local or out of towner like me!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great service! Awesome cheese plate! Good beers... All the beers were very drinkable, not the absolute best ones in town but it sure would not deter me from a Sunday Funday there. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way from the airport down to SC to visit family. Ate lunch and had a few beers. It was delicious. All of it. Our appetizer came out after our lunch which was disappointing, and I'm pretty sure our waitress quit in the middle of our lunch, so we weren't really taken care of at the end of our meal. We left SC an extra hour to stop back here on our way back because we enjoyed the beer so much though and sat in the beer garden. Great for afternoon beers with friends."}
{"text":"The Biergarten is so awesome! Love the open space indoors and outdoors. There always seems to be something cool happening too. Live music, open air markets, tons of pretzels to eat! The food is solid and the beer is great. I'll keep coming back for more of both! Prost!"}
{"text":"Tried out the new location tonight.  Great beer, the food was ok but the service was horrible.  Food took over 1 hour and our server just disappeared.  We ended up checking out at the bar.  I'd go back but I would never eat there again."}
{"text":"Another awesome Sunday dinner.  The butcher's block pizza is even better than the BBQ chicken pizza ... didn't think that was possible!  Me and the wife always split a pizza and order of wings.  Good beer is always a plus. The wife also likes the rotating selection of ciders...well not so much the rotating part.  Her favorite is blueberry cider."}
{"text":"This is THE oldest brewery in Charlotte and has made great strides since opening to accommodate it's clientele. They are a German inspired pub house that sticks to their roots. You're not going to find your IPAs or sours here but you are going to find rich, authentic Bavarian brews poured daily. On special occasions they'll even do HUGE mugs like you see in Oktoberfest!!   They have some good eats to partner along with your beer as well. These dishes stick to the Bavarian style so they match perfectly with any craft on tap that you choose.   There is a large outdoor seating area where you can find live bands on most weekends.   Enjoy yourself at the staple of Charlotte's beer scene. Prost!!"}
{"text":"The venue for the brewery is great. Tons of outdoor seating, kid and pet-friendly. The beer is good. I've really enjoyed the Fat Boy, as of late. That sets OMB up for a 5. The food is ok and decently priced. It's beer-friendly grub. I'd give it a 4. Wait staff and bartenders are kind of unfriendly and stiff. They deserve a 2. So because I enjoy drinking beer in open spaces, I've settled on a 4."}
{"text":"We brought our friends from out of town with us for our first tour here and it was absolutely delightful, and delicious!  Our tour guide, Josh, was friendly, funny, knowledgeable and truly enjoys his job, as well as his beer!  My personal favorite beer of the day was Captain Jack.  I look forward to a \"refresher\" tour again in the near future."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my journey through Charlotte, NC and I had a very good sandwich and beer.  Nice layout and atmosphere.  Sports on the televisions.  Not cheap and not expensive."}
{"text":"Great beer, hands down best outdoor space in Charlotte, and superb traditional German food! What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Awesome brewery with the best beergarten in town. Food is simple and ok for being a brewery. Tons of seating and outside bar."}
{"text":"I haven't been to all the breweries in a Charlotte but I have been coming to OMB since it opened and it has grown tremendously. I came this afternoon with my sister and her family and the place is now huge! It has tons of seating, both inside and outside. They don't serve food at the bar on weekends unless you sit at a table but there is a food truck outside that has a similar menu to the inside. The beer is great! I had one of the limited summer shadys  they created for the season. It was an easy drinking beer that compliments a hot day. OMB is family friendly so bring the kids and hang friends. I wish they had something like this in Miami."}
{"text":"Let me tell you this place has a beautiful beer garden and the inside is of a design that makes you want to come here and have a beer after work. The things you may find disappointing is the food and the beer.      I ordered the blue cheese burger with fries. The burger was salty and the flavor I was anticipating really was not there. The fries were fries. I tried most all of their beer and everything I had was just OK. Nothing that screamed for me to order a full pint of what I had. Would I go back just for the atmosphere, yes, but not just for the food and beer."}
{"text":"First night living in Charlotte, and we hit up a pizza joint that was serving the seasonal Mecktoberfest.  I wanted to try something local, and this was it!  By far the best beer since the good Lord blessed us with fermentation! Smooth and crisp with an aroma that hits you as soon as you bring the glass up to your pie hole.  It doesn't leave you thirsty either, like some other micro's I've had. The amber lager is...redonkulous.  I'm dying to try the others, yet haven't been able to find the allusive OMB Copper...it's like Bigfoot; it's only been spotted a little while ago... Noosh!"}
{"text":"What a great place to relax and have great food with some awesome locally brewed beer. We happen to be here on an August Sunday afternoon and we are sitting outside eating pretzel melt sandwiches with hornets nest beer.  I highly recommend this combo. The fries are outstanding. The prices are reasonable and the food and drink are high quality."}
{"text":"There is quite the brewery scene here in Charlotte! For someone who is newer to the area I really enjoy that the breweries are a fun, family friendly place to hang out.   Location/Atmosphere: I've been here on multiple occasions for work events and one or two times with friends. It's an incredibly large venue. The event spaces are nice with long tables and benches and they always have a bar tender, along with food. It's always clean here too. Exposed brick with long tables makes for a very nice interior. The exterior area is gorgeous! In the summer they bring in food trucks and there are outdoor games - it's a really fun scene!   Food/Drink: Full disclosure - I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband is and he likes their OMB Copper. I've had wine there often. I usually order a Pinot Grigio because they don't have Sauvignon Blanc (wish they did!). The food is OK - soft pretzels, sausage and potato salad were the stand outs.   Service: People are generally nice, bartenders are quick and kind too  Price: The food is priced very reasonably, $9-$14 for entrees. Drinks are very reasonable too, can't remember the drink prices off the top of my mind.   I really like the outdoor scene here and you should check it out during the summer/spring/fall, but given the brewery scene here in CLT, this is not my favorite brewery."}
{"text":"Love their new location! The food is way 100 times better than their old menu. Such a fun place to go after work!"}
{"text":"What a fun joint! With props to Billy Joel... Captain Jack Pilsner is helping us get by tonight!"}
{"text":"Great place to be during the day and at night! Fantastic beer, the food is ok, but the atmosphere is amazing. The outside has cornhole and sometimes live music. This place really started the brewery craze here in Charlotte! Favorite beer is the southern weiß!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at OMB is amazing. I love to bring my dog and just hang outside drink some beers and people watch. I have seen kid parties and adult parties at this place. I love OMB's beers Copper being my favorite. There is always plenty of parking even if you have to park a little far away. This place is always hopping and I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Their new place is pretty killer! Once in a while they have a really interesting beer, but if they don't have a special porter or the dunkelweisen, I'm pretty bored by what they put out."}
{"text":"This really is the mecca of Charlotte breweries. Ultimately what makes this awesome is the amazing outdoor seating with live music. I came here with a childhood friend and this is the ultimate place to enjoy good people, good times, and etc. with good beer.  Oh yes, I'm a big fan of how they have sufficient parking too. Everything is clean and new and they are some of the friendliest servers/bar tenders at a brewery I have ever encountered.  Just be warned though, if it rains - everyone huddles inside and then it can get a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent beer. They stick to the German purity law which means its nothing too crazy, but its all really good, fresh and flavorful beer. My favorites are the Captain Jack Pilsner and the Copper. I think they routinely have something like four different beers, which in my opinion is the way to do it, just really perfect a handful of brews. They also have good seasonal releases too. The location is sort of out in the cut in a warehouse area off South Blvd but the place itself is really cool, very spacious, lots of wood, kind of that \"pub\" feel. Lots of outside seating as well... and cornhole boards. Great place to spend an afternoon with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on Saturday and I don't think I like the new location as much as the old. It was not nearly as cozy and the line was insane. They only had one place to order beer and it took forever. It's only March and they were already limiting their Fruh Bock. The beer is always delicious and I'm loyal, so I'll probably be back despite the new location. I am always a fan of their Dunkel."}
{"text":"Delicious beer- Captain James Jack Pilsner & FruH Bock. First time here buy definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! very good beer and amble food selection.  Great large venue and outdoor space.  You never have to wait long for a drink.  The parking situation can be tricky but its way better than comparable breweries in Charlotte.  Check out OMB whenever you can!"}
{"text":"I personally don't understand the trend in breweries but that's just me.  It is probably a good place to get large groups together and sit outside at one of the long picnic tables.  There was live music there the night that I went that I really enjoyed. It was probably the best part of the night to be honest.  I wasn't impressed with their beers.  I have tried them on several occasions and they just don't hit the mark with me.  There are so many other local breweries to choose from that have better beer.    The inside is very clean with large tables that multiple parties can share.  We ordered the pretzel to share along with our drinks.  There was nothing special about it.  Just tastes like a regular old pretzel.  I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"German food. The sausages are great. The pretzel was not anything to brag about. The beer cheese wasn't great either. The beer was okay but nothing Id make a trip for. We are IPA fans in our house and while IPA is English, it would be nice to have a regular one on their list."}
{"text":"Beer not bad. Service sucks. Why do I need to open a tab to get one beer with my meal.  The lady at the hostess stand is lifeless and looked at my daughter like she had two heads.  It took ten minutes at least to have our order taken.  The menus are discombobulated, one page has two sides and depending on who last had the menu you may not see all the pages. Maybe the hostess could make sure the menus are in order.  Waiting on food may have to update but so far no need for a second visit.  My update:  it took 40 minutes to get our food and then the order was wrong. They got that straighten out. Food was good but the server did not bring out salt and the cucumber salad needed just a pinch. My daughter thought the hamburger was the best she had ever had. I tasted it and it was good. Planned to pay cash but my card was charged from the tab run. The manager spoke with me and offered to back out the charges and saw that the service was not up to his expectations so he did a good job of listening and we will go back for a second chance.  Maybe the waiter was just mailing it in today but he definitely setting the wrong impression on us."}
{"text":"A German Beirgarden in the midst of North Carolina. They brew a variety of beers, many of which can be tasted via a sampling platter. Beer is made in house featuring traditional flavors rather than more wacky variations. Some of the brews are seasonal, so not everything is available all year round. They also make a number of their sausages in house. In a similar fashion, they offer sampling of their sausages. The sweet and sour purple cabbage (rotkohl) is a perfect compliment. The spatzel is authentic and filling, definitely a stick to your gut meal.  Large, family style wooden tables line the dining room, TVs playing \"the game\" and a bar that stretches the entire length of the room at one end. Service was fine, but our water seemed a little lackadaisical/ \"make your order,\" but I cant judge full service based on one person, one time."}
{"text":"Came here for my cousins wedding-who would have thunk to have a reception at a brewery!? This place was AWESOME. We had the left side of the brewery reserved with the outdoor deck which was perfect- Beer was delicious and heavy and the service was great! We also was able to tour the brewery- way cool."}
{"text":"Pretty spiffy spot during the day time!  Location - easy to get to, off Old Pineville Street. Parking lot seems ample, if you get there early enough. Street parking will suffice, if there are none  Inside - I like the set up, there are three different areas where you can lounge - two outside patios on a warm breezy day, inside with the bar is swanky with displays of tshirts and different beer taps, and the other side of the establishment has your counter of beers and extra tables.   Service - nice and attentive to your needs. They make sure you are kept hydrated (whether it be beer or water) and picks up your empty mugs.  What brought me here? Their Louisana Fest which was awesome! Loved how they set up cornholes, live music, and crawfish/beers -- it was an awesome sunny and breezy day! Would definitely come back again next year. OMB - Please do add mayo to your list of condiments, thanks ^___^."}
{"text":"This is a great place to spend a warm, sunny afternoon.  We happened upon a festival with live music & Louisiana delicacies being sold outside.  The picnic tables and lively crowd made our day.  Inside there are a couple of TVs so if you are a sports fan this may not be the place for you on game night.  There is no bar seating but there are enough tables so you wouldn't have to wait.  We didn't get to try the house food because of the festival but I returned another day for the great beer selection & saw and smelled the food and I will definitely go back to try it out.  Delicious looking & smelling."}
{"text":"There is plenty of space at Old Mecklenburg Brewery.  A coworker and I stopped in for a beer.  I opted for the \"Copper\".  I liked it so much that I ordered it a few more times the rest of the week when I was traveling in Charlotte for business.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Have been going here since they opened. Great German beer. Copper is my fav by far and I've tried them all including all seasonals. Good atmosphere - they keep improving everytime I visit."}
{"text":"LOL....sat down 7:55....takes our order for drinks.   15 minutes later ONE water appears.  AGAIN, 15 minutes for drinks and only one appears.  And it's a water. Ask me if I got my beer, said no.    15 mins later, my beer comes.   30 minute beer wait at a brewery.  Order our food.  4 people at table.  2 of 4 people's food come 30 minutes later.  The other people's food does not come until 20 minutes after!!!   The manager was nice and took care of our bill, but this was an absolute circus from the second we walked in here.  Would never want anyone to experience this.  And the food was OKAY and I'm being nice for some reason.   Nice place...NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I'm going to be a little overzealous here and say I was one of the first people love this place... I remember when the only thing they served was Copper and Costco pretzels.  The beer here is one of the best, if not the best in Charlotte - All their beers are well made, from the Capt. Jack Pilsner, to the Alt style Cooper, to the truly German Hefe Hornet's Nest.  Honestly, you can read all the other good reviews for this place. All I have to say is if you've never been you are missing out. Stop reading and go... now."}
{"text":"As a fat boy I love the fat boy! #drunk the rest are decent beers, but not the fat boy. Get the damn fat boy! Don't disappoint me"}
{"text":"Went here for the German Market today. Pretty cool. You prob want to Uber or Lyft on busy weekends. Parking was a cluster today because of another shopping pop-up at Sugar Mill Brewery down the street."}
{"text":"OMB is a great place to hang out.  You come for the beer but there is so much to do while you are here  They always have great live music going on.  We have been here multiple times sometimes just to hang and others to take advantage of a special event.    You can hang out outside or stay inside.  Both are great options.  Limited food is available but it is a nice complement to the main attraction.    Would repeat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not on the IPA bandwagon that everyone else is, instead my favorites are - you guessed it - German-style brews. I can't think of a single OMB beer that I haven't liked - I think Copper appeals to the most people, but I love Dunkel, Mecktoberfest, Fruh Bock...oh who am I kidding, I love them all.   I definitely recommend visiting if you haven't already. The \"tasting room\" is designed to be like a German tasting hall and the feel is great. You can order at the bar or they have waitresses. The food has made a big improvement over the years, last visit we had pretzels and they were a million times better than they used to be. But can we get some beer cheese in here?   We've been so many times, but this last trip was the first time we took a tour. (By the way, it was their 5th anniversary. They started this craft beer thing in Charlotte.) The tour lasted about 30 minutes and took you through the history, brew process, growth plans, etc. I really enjoyed it and our tour guide was really entertaining and knowledgeable. The space is huge, I had no idea.   And as big as everyone thinks OMB is, the guide said they only represent one half of one percent of the Charlotte beer market. I guess there are still lots of Bud drinkers out there? Whyyyyyyy????  They are moving to a new space 200 yards away in early June, so I definitely recommend checking out the old space before they vacate. I'm eager to see how the new space stacks up."}
{"text":"Excited to finally check out the new OMB space this week! I loved the old space but this one is really impressive! The outdoor area is so much bigger - more tables, an area for corn hole and more green space. The inside is a lot bigger too - the new bar is gorgeous. No stools at the bar, but there are tables where you can eat.   They are debuting a new & improved menu that is much more extensive than the old menu. We tried one of the pizzas - it was mushroom/onion and we added prosciutto (for an extra dollar or so). The dough is made with Copper...mmmmm. I have to say I didn't have high expectations for the pizza, but it was really good! Enough toppings and perfectly cooked (the prosciutto had a little crunch, yum). I'm definitely looking forward to a pretzel with beer cheese next time.   As always, I'm a fan of their brews - german style is by far my favorite. They had a secret stash of dunkel on tap, so that made my day!  I can see heading to OMB a lot more now that they have better/more food options and it's really a place to drink a few and stay a while."}
{"text":"***Beer and Facility review only***  Okay so this place is indeed pretty awesome. What a facility! It's almost like a beer drinking campus and I want to enroll for classes! The Biergarten is huge. Tons of tables with umbrellas in a self service area. A small tent that sells beer and a Berlin Grill food truck( not sure if that is a permanent fixture or not). Inside is styled like a traditional German beer hall/fest hall. Long tables where you sit and conglomerate with other drinkers/diners. There are no stools at the bar but you could easily fit 30-60 people in just that section. The decor is sparse but spot on. Even the bathrooms are cool with long trough like sinks. This place is fancy yet simple all at the same time; clean lines everywhere you look, and a sparkling giant wall of glasses behind the bar.. So what's the focus? Beer...good fresh beer ...the Dunkel was very light tasting for a dark beer and the Mecktoberfest was a great representation of a seasonal Oktoberfest beer. The menu looks so, so good with both traditional German dishes and sides being offered along with some American favorites with a twist. I cannot wait to go back and have a full meal. You need to go there, pure and simple."}
{"text":"COPPER...need I say more?! Its worth buying a large bottle of the beer since the refills are so inexpensive! WOW! Make sure to get the tour and fun explanation of their brewing process. I dig the european concept and feel of the place. Its a good time had by all!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and Great food! OMB has amazing staff and the atmosphere is so much fun. If you are looking for a fun place to just grab some drinks during the day or somewhere to have a fun night out this is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"This is a great new location. The building and grounds are really expansive, and it has the feel of a German beer hall and Biergarten. It must have just opened when I first went, because the food options other reviewers described were not yet available; there was just a ghetto-looking food truck (no service window) parked in the Biergarten. I'm glad they seem to have resolved that issue.  My major gripe about this place is about OMB itself. Why are there so few varieties of beer? Why doesn't a brewery experiment with new brews?! The beer selection is generally good, but it's incredibly boring."}
{"text":"Cool place to hangout with friends. Tuesday evenings is even more colorful outside with the yoga camp. Try OMBs Copper for sure."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome.  The one I had with pineapple has to be the top 5 burgers I've ever had.  Beers were very expensive 5.10 for a draft copper.  Food was decently priced.  The place was packed!  Long tables.  Enjoyed our meal"}
{"text":"This was my second stop on a brewery tour of Charlotte. This place is walking distance away from Sugar Creek, so it can make for a good time drinking beer. I got a flight of their beers, and while none really stood out was amazing, they were at least solid and enjoyable. The place itself seems very family friendly and dog friendly so it's a place almost anybody can enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome beer and great food.  Tonight they only had their annual beers on tap (which is still great) but on occasion they have special brews on tap that are amazing.   If you ever have a chance to try imperial copper don't pass it up !    Fun place, great food, good prices.    Highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Not at all what I was expecting. This place is huge and perfect for warm fall or spring days when it's not too hot to hang outside. The food outside is just okay (don't have the full menu) but it seemed most folks came for the beer. They had live music which wasn't horrible and plenty of seating. Lots of families were there too which I didn't expect. It was kind of like hanging out and drinking at a neighborhood block party."}
{"text":"Of all the breweries I visited in Charlotte, this was was the most interesting.   Everything here is from Germany, even the furniture. From what was explained in the tour, the owner wanted to keep everything in a strict fashion as to the way beer is made in Germany. While I didn't really learn anything new on the tour about how beer is made, I have to say that the delivery of the information was the best I've seen. The guy giving the tour was extremely knowledgeable. One thing I did find interesting about the brewery was that they keep their own yeast cultures which isn't something you see a ton of these days.  I tried a flight with an extra tasting on the side so that I could try everything they had available that day. My personal favourite of the day was the Captain Jack. The Domm Kolsch was good also and it was cool to find out that it came from a home brewer who won a contest.  While OMB's beers weren't my favourite of the Charlotte breweries I visited I would recommend anyone to come check these guys out."}
{"text":"I liked the Mecktoberfest: notes of caramel and malt, very smooth and very drinkable!  There are beer by the glass or by the flight options.  There's plenty of indoor seating and a huge outdoor patio area, with a large interesting wall mural next to a viewing area of their stainless tanks.  The gravel parking lot has ample spots. Service at the uncrowded bar was efficient but not the friendliest."}
{"text":"The Copper is my new lover. No really, there's proof in an incriminating photo of me kissing a bottle of the stuff. It's delicious, so much so that the boy got a bottle to take back home with us. I also tried another \"very hoppy\" version, which wasn't quite to my tastes so I forget the name. If you like a lot of hops, though, you'd love that beer!  I love that it's more traditional right down to the beer hall you sit in, and the staff is well-trained in German brew methods. I didn't get to go on a tour as there was a race in the morning followed by World Cup viewing in the afternoon, but I'd love to go behind the scenes and watch the beer brewing in action. Fantastic and wish it was as far south as Atlanta, though four hours away isn't too bad I suppose!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best tap house brew joints in town if you like their beer.  There in lies my problem.  Just not a fan of the beer they brew.  I feel like I'm not the norm based on the popularity of this place but they have also been doing a marketing job unlike any of the other micro/craft brew houses.    Bar area is nice and clean, lacking a little on TV's but not lacking in service.  I'm sure given the nice large room they can cater to some pretty large groups."}
{"text":"Thought I had reviewed this place before but I guess not.  Nothing to say here that hasn't already been noted but I'll just put it out there that this isn't exactly a craft beer nerd's delight.  Now, I know all about German purity laws and what not but it should be noted that if you like variety you're gonna have a bad time.  If you like consistent craft brewed lagers, pales and pilsners then you will love it.  The interior of the place and the outdoor seating really make up for the majority of the lack of creative flavors.  It's warm and cozy on the inside and delightfully spacious and green out.  If you are a beer nerd specifically in the style of beers they offer then by all means go.  If you are looking for a 'WOW' beer, then you have other options."}
{"text":"We went here in the winter and the place was packed both inside and out. You can order food and beer outside and they have heaters scattered around. Lots of dogs too."}
{"text":"This brewery has an awesome interior that resembles a German beer hall. The seating is long tables and benches. The beer selection consists of German style lagered beers. I had the dunkel and the Baltic porter, both of which were excellent, especially the porter.   As for the food, the menu is made up of a mix of German dishes along with more typical American fare like wings and burgers. I went with the Reuben and my wife had the bratwurst. We also split a soft pretzel with beer cheese. Just like with the beer, everything was terrific.  Outside of the beer hall there is a large beer garden with a bar. Unfortunately it was pouring rain when we went, so we didn't get the outdoor experience. I will definitely come back when I can sit outside and enjoy some more of their delicious beer and food."}
{"text":"Had a great time!!! Food was awesome and our server Sierra was just fabulous!! I would recommend this place to guests who are looking for a relaxed experience with some great local beer and great food choices inside and outside. The biergarten is absolutely gorgeous this time of year :)"}
{"text":"This new spot is great. Has a HUGE outdoor area and it has plenty of seats for everyone! They are very dog friendly and a great space for them to run around in the grassy area that they have.  The beers have a good selection, I like the more lighter beers which they have some good wheat beers to choose from.  They have really good pretzels there too, but do not pay extra for the beer cheese because it does not taste that great and is not worth the extra money. Just stick to mustard."}
{"text":"Live music and cold beer what a great afternoon. The Apple Brothers are bringing some great music today"}
{"text":"I loved this place.   They only have 5 beers on tap but they were all great German brews.  I wasn't a fan of the Baltic porter, but it was just my taste.    The German food was amazing.   We all got something different so we could could try each other's food.  The potato salad was amazing, crab dip... amazing, the Ruben...delicious, I could keep going on.  The brewery was spotless.  I loved the open  festhaus setting in the dinning area.   OMB has just become my lunch place for my trips back to Charlotte.. I was highly impressed."}
{"text":"A very cool spot for a quick beer and bite to eat or hosting a formal event. Close to the airport made my trip very convenient. The German beer was outstanding and the food was delicious. I highly recommend trying their assortment of sausages.. the wide array of flavors will knock your socks off. Take time while you are there to walk around and see the beauty and design the grounds have to offer."}
{"text":"Flew into town and decided to eat and drink here on whim. We were not disappointed. Place was crowded, but the tables are seat yourself bier garden style, so people were willing to shuffle around to fit 6 of us. Beer was good, food good, and our service was on point. Faith took great care of us, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food and great Beer! The service was helpful but several of the brews where not being served. I want to think that demand was so high they ran out. Overall great experience! Their Dunkel was great, and we will be back! 4/5 bc of limited beer selection."}
{"text":"My husband is into craft beer so we went there with some friends while we were in town. They tried 8 beers, a friend said they didn't vary too much in taste in her opinion, but they were good. They had a small German-themed  snack menu and some Wurst meal options. The waitress... working in a brewery bringing people flights of beer... didn't know what a taster glass was :-/"}
{"text":"I get the niche they are going for and the theme for their beer. I'm not saying what they produce is bad - it's just not my type of beer. No IPA or other hoppy beers. Definitely go if you're into lagers, ambers, etc. The atmosphere is great though, I will concede that. However, they are moving so we'll see if that changes."}
{"text":"Love that this place is right around the corner from my house now! Great atmosphere, good beer and good food. I love that they have 37 oz growlers so I can get a couple different beers each visit.  The way they fill growlers helps them last in the fridge more than a couple days, which is awesome.  My only complaint is that the past couple times I've ordered the German potato salad, it's been served cold.  German potato salad should be served warm.  Guess I'll get a different side from now on.  Besides that, it's a great place to grab a beer and meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great food.  Love the brats and beer.  The outside Brauhaus is a great concept for Charlotte.  I am looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Real ale!!!! Great beer and friendly service. A great way to spend an afternoon!"}
{"text":"Great facility, staff, and atmosphere. But I thought the beers were mediocre.  I'm a huge fan of lagers but most of the beers I had on my flight were not impressive."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect spot for bringing a large group, your kids, your grand kids or a company function.  They have a huge outdoor area, tons of tables and multiple spots for grabbing food and beer.  I will admit, I prefer much more complex beers than what they are serving here but for what they are, a pure German beer garden, they do it perfectly.  Literally if you look up what a German beer garden is supposed to look and operate like, this is the place.  We recently came here with our friend Kate T. to meet a group on a Saturday afternoon.  it was a beautiful day, the mecktoberfest was flowing and the pretzels and beer cheese were phenomenal.  I also got my favorite dish, the curry wurst.  It is a bratwurst with fries and curry ketchup, a solid beer munchie dish, not very refined but solids.  I am happy to go here when the crowd wants to, get some curry wurst and force down a couple coppers.  That is their hoppiest beer, coming in somewhere around 30 IBUs.  As I said, they do German purity law beer and do it well.  Beer for the masses as I call it.  Bring the kids, bring the grand kids and enjoy a sunny day in their back yard, it is a great spot to bring your parents too!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here with out of town relatives. I've lived in Germany& Switzerland and find this beer garden  just as pleasant as some of my European favorite spots."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Great German fair with even better German beer. Usually live music on weekends. Take the tour if you can. Fantastic group."}
{"text":"Great TRUE German style beers done right - FRESH! Made with care by a small team at OMB, the tap room has a great German feel to it and a comfort to it that makes it an ideal place for a few beers after work. No need to worry about parking, they've got a huge lot and there's no traffic or hassle getting there since it's right on Old Pineville Rd near Woodlawn!  Tours of the brewhouse are free on Saturday @ 2, 3 and 4pm - definitely worth a check out if you're even mildly interested in the world's greatest beverage!"}
{"text":"Soooooo.....torn between a 2 and a 3 here. Stopped in during a business trip looking for a good beer and food. The good - this place has a great outdoor seating area with loads of picnic tables and lawn area to hang out. Location is near airport in a very nondescript industrial zone. Inside the facility is REALLY loud - they were less than 50% of capacity and the ambient noise was pretty loud. Now for the food....ordered the black and blue burger and the burger itself was OK. Nothing spectacular but also not remarkable. The fries were the worst ever - lukewarm and chewy. How do you make French fries chewy??  Seriously???  OK....moving on from that. When I told my server about the fries she feigned interest but didn't go any further than that.  After thinking this over I'm going with the 2.  I'm not a huge fan of German beer so am not taking the beer quality into consideration in my review."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I missed out on this before I left to the UK. And I've been back for a year and still managed to not find time to get here. So when an out of town friend wanted to meet for a beer, I suggested we give this spot a whirl. We were not disappointed.  He had the OMB Copper and the Dunkel. I stuck with the Captain Jack (a pilsner) and had two of those. Really tasty and with a good sharp flavor. I could drink bunches of 'em. We sat inside so we could talk, but outside there was a live band. They also have food - sausages and other German haus food - but he wanted some of our great BBQ so after the brews, we headed elsewhere. Five beers for under $20 plus tip - a pretty good deal.  Factoid: Captain James Jack was one of the signatories of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, which predates the US Declaration of Independence by a year. He was also one of the representatives from our area to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. What a journey that must have been - no airport, no highways. It's over 500 miles and that's with I-85 and I-95. Wow!  I'll definitely be back to OMB! Hooray for Charlotte and all these great breweries that we're getting!"}
{"text":"The largest of the breweries scattering the South End area. Finally got a chance to come and try the German-themed beer and food and was not disappointed. I ordered the copper (light) and my girlfriend got the fat boy (dark), both were delicious. Margarita pizza and the Reuben were also tasty.   The indoor and outdoor areas are both huge with a number of long tables and tons of spots to sit and stand comfortably. Our waitress Kara was very attentive. All in all will definitely be returning to Olde Meck!"}
{"text":"This was the best wings (we had the recommended Carolina BBQ sauce) as well as mac n cheese especially considering I'm not a Big Mac n cheese fan. The pot roast dinner was enormous but relatively tasteless. I would not order that again. Cold beer nice atmosphere very friendly folks. I would go back but stick to wings and pasta."}
{"text":"The only way Olde Meck's new brewery could feel more like an authentic Bavarian beer hall would be if they added a polka band and dressed the servers in lederhosen. With its long wooden tables, spacious outdoor biergarten, and fantastic menu of German fare, this is easily the coolest brewery in Charlotte. Oh, and the beer's pretty damn good, too.   Brewed in accordance with Germany's oldest purity law (the 'Reinheitsgebot'), Olde Meck's beers taste fresh and crisp, especially when enjoyed at this incredible taproom. Their signature beer, Copper, is a delicious amber that's particularly well-suited for drinking in the fall or winter. My other favorites include Southside Weiss, Hornet's Nest (a wonderful Hefeweizen), and their seasonal Mecktoberfest.   The grub menu is fairly extensive, from wonderful German pretzels and sausages, to more traditional American fare like salads and pizzas. They also have a solid kids' menu, and the taproom and biergarten are totally family-friendly. We enjoyed everything we ordered, particularly the gigantic pretzels!  The weather wasn't great the day we visited, so we dined inside, but I'm looking forward to getting back on an autumn afternoon to enjoy the spectacular biergarten. The Olde Mecklenburg brewery is simply the best place in Charlotte to drink some wonderful beer and eat some great food, in a fantastic setting that every other local brewery should strive to replicate."}
{"text":"Good beer, awesome outdoor area, good live music....you can't go wrong! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Guy driving the gray OMB cube car is a real douche.  If you drive a company car, be decent enough to let someone over in traffic instead of speeding up to block them. Cancelling my monthly work event plans for there.  Will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is with this place, beer was average at best and food was horrible.  I believe 6 beers on tap and chicken nuggets...really, cold chicken nuggets.  Skip Olde Meck and hit up any of the other breweries in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for is birthday last year and we've loved it ever since! He still says that touring the brewery and getting to try beer straight out of the tank was the best birthday present ever! The staff is very friendly and down to earth and the food is delicious. We love the german-style tables where strangers can eat together at bench seats but they also offer individual tables."}
{"text":"Amazing food and beer. I've been back a few times being new to the area. The bar I work in has some OMB on tap, great beer and beautiful brewery!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised about this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is a warm, cozy, family style haven. The beer is delicious and the food surprisingly not just a great compliment, but delicious on its own. Overall, it feels very German. The only reason I'm not giving them all 5 stars is the waitstaff. They are great with beer knowledge, but have a tendency to be inattentive and disappear for long periods."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW is solely for Louisiana Crawfish Festival.   First, they ran out on Saturday. We arrived about 7pm but there was a promise that there would be more on Sunday.   Second, this was promoted as pet friendly and they held to that. Enough dogs, on leashes, and it was so cute to see the pet kids behave better than all us adults.   Third, the \"neighborhood\" bikers. I say that with quotes because they were notorious on Scaleybark when I lived Southend met at the festival. I thought it would be a race but nope just your friendly riders out in tights. hee hee  Fourth, When you walk in they ask for ID. I figured quickly it was for liquor and asked may I not have one since I don't drink? It was met with a friendly smile and boom a quirky look. And I'm in.   Fifth, the price sheet was laying on the vendor table. There were several for beer only 1 for food. Shrimp $14, Pretzels $5 ....umm, see my picture for the deets. I had to ask about the cost of crawfish as the sheet didn't list it. No one knew. 1 girl forgot but the guy whom I asked was new to the station and just started at 3pm. Please note: you shouldn't hear any tenseness in my tone because I have volunteered at enough festivals to know what that is like. Luckily for me, I've always sold the same items  - beer, brats, corn in the husk...Thank God for Wisconsin vending and fundraising:)   Anywhoo, Sunday we returned after brunch to pick up and go home to have crawfish later. $12 a pop like we were promised on Saturday. It included halves of a red potato and one niblet ear of corn. They did cook the potato in seasoning but not so much the corn. The kid said everything was separated but I know the corn was overcooked. To quote my mother, \"It was gummy.\" Ewww  The crawfish didn't have seasoning shaken across the shelltop like we do in Louisiana but hey it was good enough to be 1,000 miles away from home and at $12, which is on the high end, I hope it went to a good cause.   If you wanted to hang around there was live music and liquor following plus wood picnic tables like home with a breeze blowing on Saturday but not Sunday.   I'm grateful for the guy that posted this on Yelp as an event because I promise I never heard a bit of advertising even last year when I was living in the Myers Park area. At any rate 4 stars for the effort, kept promises, festival atmosphere, cool weather then hot Sunday...although they can't control it and being pet friendly.   I'd go back and refer others."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and awesome beers. If you are looking for hops you won't find any here! We had conch fritters and a pizza and both were very good. I wish we had this place at home such a cool hang out. The outdoor area is huge. Dog friendly and a local guy playing guitar. They also have an outdoor food truck and bar if you don't want to dine inside. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is it took awhile for a server to acknowledge us but once they did they were fast and efficient. Already planning our next trip to the area just to get the hornets nest!! Super fun chill place great place for a large group to hang out."}
{"text":"So, the truth is, I love OMB and will keep coming again and again.  If for no other reason than the atmosphere. I'm a Captain Jack girl, so I'm not the best reviewer of the other brews. I'm sure that many others on here can give better assessments.   I do have to say that their food could use a little more TLC.  The bread to sausage ratio is pretty high and it would be so much more enjoyable to have toasted or even steamed bread.  It wouldn't hurt to warm the German potato salad either."}
{"text":"The secret is the menu INSIDE OMB! This is easily one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. The atmosphere indoors and outdoors is relaxing and enjoyable. Outside they have a small menu of simple German treats which are OK. The menu inside is the hidden gem, unfortunately you have to be sitting inside to order off of it though! The atmosphere inside is still equally as inviting and exciting.   What we got inside:   -Margherita pizza: This was DELICIOUS! Crust was fluffy but had a crunch, mozzarella was fresh and tomatoes were ripe! I would get this 100 times over.  -Rueben sandwich: this was also very good! We got the Bratkartoffeln potatoes (German-style home fries with bacon sautéed onions and fresh herbs) with it which were great!"}
{"text":"Great place! Crowded but they had fire pits out in the beer gardens and indoor seating. Seemed to be a 25-45 year old crowd of mostly educated slightly hipster people. There were dogs and young children also. Parking is a bear and it calmed down after 7pm. Fantastic place to go with friends or groups."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Dog frienly. Few food option but still pretty good. Nice place to hang out, big out doors area. Will come back."}
{"text":"What s fun place, especially if you are families with it missing the German beer gardens. Closest thing I've experienced in the States. Family oriented outdoor garden, music good lots of kids and dogs welcome. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting OMB. The first time, my coworkers birthday. Second, my fiancé and I met with friends. I'm so happy this place is dog friendly.   Warming!!! Do not bring your animal inside!!! The staff will get super nasty!!! They snapped at my former boss and she was super embarrassed!!!   Please note. Everyone is nice--just keep your fur friends outside lol. I enjoyed my visits here. Great for large groups, wine lovers, beer connoisseurs, engagement parties, Yoga and more. I brought my  7month old German Shepard and he got plenty of attention  Side note: it's ok to bring you, children.  Great place to meet after work, or a Sunday evening. I wish they had cider beer (grr) still love this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about Old Mecklenburg Brewery! We went for the first time this past week and actually going back tonight for more food and great drinks!   The atmosphere is awesome! Huuuuuge brewery in general. The beer garden is awesome! So nice, very roomy, and decorated nicely. The inside is just as nice. Really big also, clean, and easily accessible to the bar.   For how big it was I was surprised at how on point the service was. We sat down and had someone come to us right away and take our drink orders. My boyfriend is obsessed with the Mecktoberfest so he got that and I got a glass of wine as usual. Both really good tasting drinks.   We ordered a Pretzel for an appetizer-delish! For dinner we got a Caprese panini and a Reuben, like I said awesome food for a brewery! Definitely looking forward to going back and trying something else! This is a great place to hang out especially outside in the beautiful Charlotte weather!"}
{"text":"German style brewery that is great place to spend a sunny (or not sunny) afternoon.  Good bar food - pretzel and brats were perfect with the copper. Liked all the beer I tried especially the copper.  First stop on my friends 50th birthday brew cruise.  This is a really impressive place and CLT is for real when it comes to local beer."}
{"text":"Beer good. But stick to the German food if you want something descent to eat! Hamburgers suck and they ran out of buns! Really!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of space! The back patio is hugeeeee. The atmosphere is very laid back and casual. They have a decent selection of beer. I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have wine options also.    I came here for happy hour and ordered a glass of wine with a pretzel. The beer cheese that came with the pretzel was so good!! I'd come back just for the pretzel.   The staff is friendly, but the service wasn't exceptional."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good beer. Probably some of the better beers I've had here. Okay food. My boyfriend's dad is German so he has set the bar high. Nice atmosphere. Very large outdoor patio with live music on Friday."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with OMB beer. But first let me talk about how big this brewery is. The German Brewery has a huge outdoor area where they have live bands and giant fire pits when it's cold. Also lots of seating. Inside they have private rooms for hosting parties, two bar areas, and plenty of indoor seating. Most of it is first come first serve. I love two types of beer they offer: Captain Jack (lager) and Hornets Nest (hefeweizen). Another honorable mention is the Dunkel. They also have really cool glasses for each. They are one of the smart breweries and don't put there logos on the glasses so people won't steal them. They also serve food; highly recommend the pretzels and beer cheese. Also pet friendly outside!"}
{"text":"This place is just cool. The picnic-style tables outside give it a really relaxed feel, but the beer looks very high end and tasty. I don't drink beer - so one star off because there is no vodka! Lol I did see one girl with a glass that looked like it could have been wine, but basically if you come here expect to drink beer, but regardless the atmosphere is great. Also, huge parking lot for those who aren't drinking over .08 ;)"}
{"text":"Had great beer of course and the food was pretty good. Had the sausage sampler."}
{"text":"OMB, I've been raving about your beers ever since I found them at some of the local stores and restaurants.  Tonight I was able to experience them at your brewery.  This brewery is literally on my way home from work so it was quite convenient to stop Friday after work.  On draft today was Copper, Capt Jack and Mecktoberfest, all of which I have tasted before,  Copper reminds me of Yuengling...not as much body, but still a very good beer.  Capt Jack is ok but like someone at my table said, it can be a little bitter.  Now Mecktoberfest....I could bathe in this beer.  It is definitely my favorite fall brew - so much flavor and so smooth.  I can definitely see myself stopping here regularly on the way home from work.  Just a note to the reviewer who gave poor ratings on the food, this is a brewery.  You come here for the beer, not the food.  Most small independent breweries don't give you the food option."}
{"text":"Not a beer drinker but I wanted to try out a local brewery.  They have a German restaurant inside so after the informative beer tour, we went to check out their grub.  B: Pretzel Beer - Warm, soft pretzels made to be dipped in creamy beer cheese  A: Wings - oh so cripsy. super fried, very wing worthy - do recommend  A: Potato Salad - I really enjoyed the sourness to it  B-: Butcher's Block Pizza - overloaded with sausage, not a fan of sausage but do try if you are  B: Bratwurst - I've had so many in Germany, I no longer eat them, I did a sample of them and they're pretty much all the same  B: Cesar Salad - very straight forward  A: Perfectly breaded and fried, must try  If you love beer and German food, this is the perfect place for you!  I enjoyed it without the beer."}
{"text":"Reasonably price; for 4 beers, and 2 appetizers it was $30. Banging soft pretzels and Captain Jack cheese. I got a heffenwizen with banana cloves. It came a 17 oz pint glass, which was huge! We also ordered the hummus platter. The boys really liked their baltic burbon-aged porter known as \"Fat Boy.\" The facility is huge with both inside seating and out door seating. They have rooms sectioned off to hold private events."}
{"text":"First time there. The place is huge but plenty of parking. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating has heaters at some of them. There were also fire pits. I had the Copper beer, excellent. I had a rueben sandwich which was very good. My friend had the ultimate burger which was also good. Service was very good even though the place was busy.  They give tours but didn't take one this trip"}
{"text":"Fun Fun Fun..Place!  Great facility, a lot of room and a ton of fantastic friendly people, especially those behind the bar!  We came in from San Diego and asked Siri for the closest Brewery and were fortunate enough to have the OMB pop up!  Good beer with spacious building and grounds.  Outdoors there was live music.  But the best of our find at the PMB was Carly our server!!  Extremely friendly, smart and energetic.  She explained our choices, was entertaining, and loves dogs!  A brewery and dogs are allowed in the huge outdoor area, great combo!  So go in and have fun, you will have a blast.....and if you get Carly, you know this just could be the Pub you will call your own.  She was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a brew and chat amongst friends.. I'm a cyclist who tries to make the Sunday ride on a weekly basis.. Very well put together and always look forward to grabbing a post ride beer.. Great atmosphere. The tour is a must."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good food. This was my first visit to the new location and it was great.  I am a fan of OMB's Captain Jack. I was able to try a few others, including Hornet's Nest which is a new favorite.  I was here with two others so I was able to try a few of the menu items. The Butchers Block pizza was good - no shortage on the meats here. The pretzel and beer cheese was another good choice. The best dish, in my opinion, was the Reuben. I am normally not a fan but I will order this again! In addition to beer and food, we took the tour of the brewery. Our tour guide, Dustin, was great. Very informative. If you have the opportunity to go on one his tours don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"I know German food...I really do. I grew up on the stuff in Germany..so yea. I was going to be in town an saw the reviews and got excited because German restaurants are hard to come by in the US. I will say, I did not try the beer but my coworker did and he was satisfied. But on to my gripe-- I ordered sauerkraut ---which makes me nervous because ever since I've been in the US its been very bitter and...it was VERY bitter. I as so disappointed. The Spátzle with the jagerschnitzel  sauce was okay could of used a bit more flavor but it satisfied my taste buds. The würst I ordered on the other hand was excellent."}
{"text":"Oh so excited about this new location!  So much seating inside and outside.  Beautiful setup and decor.  There was a wedding reception here on opening weekend.  I am so glad to see this brewery do so well.  I've been a huge fan from the beginning and am excited to see them grow and do wonderful things for the community.  Great beer options and now such a fantastic atmosphere, I will bring all of my out of town guests here.  This is definitely a must-do in Charlotte.  PROST!"}
{"text":"Under cooked brat kartoffel and the bratwurst was cold. The interior is very nice as well as the biergarten. The food has been disappointing the last few times. The bier is also over priced. $10 for a 6 pack from the source is a little over priced."}
{"text":"If you like their beer definitively make time to visit the brew house. The outdoor area is huge and on cold nights they light fires and have seating around them.  While I like their beer, I do not generally buy it when there are other options so I come here pretty much because of their wonderful outdoor area.  The food here could use some improvement. Their pannis are okay, and I would avoid the southwest turkey wrap. I wanted to like their burgers but the time we ordered them mine and my dining companion's burgers came out completely overcooked (despite both ordering medium) and the bacon I ordered ended up on his burger. We never saw our waitress again (a different surfaced to bring the check) so there wasn't the opportunity to mention it. We also never got the appetizer we ordered, though they easily took it off the bill when we disputed it. This brewery makes for a good bar location but could work on the food and service."}
{"text":"4 stars for ambiance, though the beer is not my favorite, with only 1 beer low in IBU listed. The wine was decent but a little overpriced. The food (that I've had so far anyway) was also a little disappointing; the pretzel tasted like a frozen one, and beer cheese was pretty good but had a slightly odd taste. My boyfriend liked his curry brat. I'll be here more often if they brew more ale and fruit beer!  Note to establishment: if you're going to put meat in potato salad, you need to list that on the menu, because that's not normal."}
{"text":"Great spot for a few pints with friends. The best place in Charlotte for fresh German style beers (every Beer brewed here follows the Reinheitsgebot - German beer purity law). Awesome beer garden with lots of seating, cornhole, and a food truck. Great staff and a full menu with German and non German options. If you can, go on the weekend for free tours. An excellent place to show off to out of towners visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good beer. Nice facility. Service is substandard at best. It took our waitress 40 minutes to greet our table...40! I timed it. And no one came over to clean our table from the previous guests...we cleaned it ourselves.  A 1/3 of the menu had big \"X's\" on the menu items that were not available....weird??? Not impressed with the service at all. We actually left to go eat somewhere else. It's very loud inside too. Makes it hard to have a conversation. Hopefully these are just growing pains in their new location. But they better step it up or they'll be out of business."}
{"text":"I too enjoyed a great night at OMB for the Brewer's Ball. What a fantastic venue (I look forward to touring soon). The place is well suited for medium to large crowds and had a nice porch area if you needed to get a bit more breathing room.   Love the Mecktoberfest - it's very drinkable which is nice for a fall beer, because some can be a bit spice-heavy."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.  If you want a cold pretzel, a cold/mediocre tasting sausage sub, a poor attitude from the folks working the outside food truck, rug rats at your feet, hipster parents and dog owners that definitely need sessions with Cesar Milan...then this the place for you.  BTW, OMB beers are available at your local grocery store and many other drinking establishments and breweries....save yourself a poor experience and head out to any of the other breweries in Charlotte, i.e. Bulldog, Wooden Robot, Unknown...hell head to Olde Sycamore and deal with the long lines for the food trucks, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"I went to an event at the new space and was so impressed I had to return. At our event we only had a few choices of beers, so I just assumed that was a limit on the party, not their standard selection. I was wrong. When I returned, they only had a few beers on tap none of which sounded new or different so I returned to the old-standard Copper. I enjoy Copper and all, but part of going to a craft brewery is trying some new varieties...and that's one place I definitely think OMB could improve.   During the party the German food was delicious. Like another reviewer mentioned, many of the items were not available and had big red exes over the items. Haven't they been open long enough to offer the entire menu? This time I tried the Caprese Panini and I was underwhelmed. It was really bland and boring and they forgot to put on the lemon aioli. The German potato salad on the side was really good, so stick to the German menu and I don't think you'll be dissappointed. Service was very slow and forgetful. Maybe it's because it's a big place or because it's busy, but she forgot drinks and I had to track down a random busser for my side of aioli.   On  the positive side, this new venue is absolutely gorgeous and would be perfect for an event large or small. The place itself is five stars worthy.I saw a lot of kids so I'd say it is fairly family friendly considering it's still technically a brewery..  Overall, I will give them another chance...maybe once it quiets down a little bit and they hit their stride."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The interior of the building is gorgeous and they have a great outside area as well.  Their blue cheese burger is really good.  The atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"OMB is a great spot to grab a German beer, some German (or not) grub, and hang out with some friends in the spacious venue. Creating great German beer for longer than I've been around Charlotte, I always love stopping by OMB for a couple beers with friends, and it's and absolute must stop on any brewery tour.  On my latest stop into OMB, I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte and got one of the non-German food items on their menu. I was incredibly happy with my selection.  I'm mostly going to talk about the bread - it was unbelievable, probably the best rye bread I've ever had. When eating a reuben, it's imperative that a strong rye flavor comes through as it complements the center ingredients perfectly. This rye bread was everything you could hope for and more. On top of that it was perfectly crisped, something most restaurants seem to struggle with for whatever reason.   The rest of the reuben was slightly above average, with decent corned beef, slightly underwhelming cheese, and good tart kraut. The proportions were also done pretty well even though the bites weren't quite as consistent as you'd typically want.  Although most people stop into OMB for the beer, the reuben is pretty great and is worth trying on your next visit."}
{"text":"Hey it's about the closest you'll get to a true brauhaus or brauerei here in Charlotte. A close second would have to be Waldhorn but that's a restaurant. This. Is a brewery. Charlotte's most famous by far, even if it is a bit commercialized these days. If you go to a chain restaurant in Charlotte they will proudly proclaim they carry local beer on tap! A la OMB Copper to be specific.  There's nothing wrong with the Copper honestly. It's a good standard beer. But make your way to the brewery itself for a broader selection with more character. And speaking of character, check out the lay of this place. It's really amazing. I'd never been to the original location but this one rocks. They have a huge beer garden with ample room for huge groups. There's a place for a stage and a band to play. The brew room is viewable from outside through some huge windows. There's a separate food bar outside where you can order German brewfest staples like pretzels with mustard or cheese, brats, and so on. Inside you'll find a more extensive menu of German restaurant offerings including 6 different kinds of wurst, Jagerschnitzel, Wienerschnitzel, red cabbage, sauerkraut and spatzle. Of course this list is certainly not everything.  The inside has that grandiose German feel. Lots of wood and huge doors. The bar is lined with copper piping feeding probably 20 or more individual taps. The food is great, the beer is good and the service isn't bad. Yeah, they're a bit overrated and the place feels like it's trying too hard. But I've got nothing wrong with it. Just writing about it makes me crave those German eats! Side note: they have a road cycling meet here on Sundays that usually numbers over 100 riders. If that says anything about the popularity. Anyways, what's better than a plate of German food and a beer after a 30 mile bike ride??"}
{"text":"Love hanging out here! Such a great atmosphere, I usually stick to the outside because we bring the dog, but the inside bar and private rooms are beautiful. Pretty good beer, I like the Copper and Hornets Nest, and they do seasonals as well. They often have live music. It's huge and on any given day there could be a 1 year old's birthday, wedding event, large groups of friends, and tons of dogs all at one time."}
{"text":"I like what OMB has to offer. Most of the beer is good. The food has been pretty good. Most of the staff is friendly and engaging. The compound is large and after the most recent expansion is huge! Plenty of space to spread out outdoors and bring your dog if you have one .. oh yeah and those kid things too - if you have one of those...  Outdoor beer service is also available at the beer barn. You can also order from a smaller bar bites menu from the expansive food trailer towards the far side of the outdoor area. That area is all self-service, there is also seating under cover outside and that is full service assistance.  Smoking is allowed outside, but the area is big enough that hopefully - if your don't like it - you can get away from it.  The restrooms are state-of-the-art, large, and always clean. There is also plenty of space to host corporate, family or friend get-togethers, weddings and receptions. Looks like a lot of fun!  If there is no parking in the main lot behind the brewery, try next door at the new corporate office. Or do the smartest thing and Uber/Lyft!  Cheers! \"Drink Responsibly\""}
{"text":"I drink way less now than I used to at various times in my life.  And I was never a huge drinker of beer regardless.  Yet it is still nice to see that the Queen City has another local gem in the form of the OMB.  Not the first brewery in the city limits by a long shot, yet definitely a different breed than the more corporate stylings of Hops, Rock Bottom or even the now-departed South End.  This is more akin to a winery, where you can see the inner workings - and even take a tour if you so choose - partaking of the product at the end.  Or even at the beginning, or skipping the tour entirely in favor of the suds.  I get that the City of Charlotte has little in the way of country charm, or charm at all for that matter, having long ago forgone those details in the favor of building at all costs.  So the one downside is that the OMB is on a side road, in a very industrialized location that you are most assuredly not likely to find unless you really know where you are going, and even once you do, you probably will not be overwhelmed by the exterior of the building.  That is truly a shame.  Be patient, as the inside is not nice, but it is nicer than the outside by a large margin."}
{"text":"The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery isn't quite the grandpappy of the Charlotte brewery scene. That would probably be Hops (which isn't there any longer). It could be Southend Brewery (also no longer there), or even Rock Bottom (at least it's still there).  Aside from several of these places being closed, they all had one other thing in common: They weren't actually from Charlotte, and were parts of larger chains. So in that regard, we'll give the nod to OMB.  However, perhaps in a nod to these brethren, they have closed their original place on Southside Drive - currently occupied by Sugar Creek Brewery - and moved into a much more spacious - and considerably less warehouse-like - spot. And it is awesome.  Several indoor rooms/event spaces are available, each seemingly larger than the last. But the coup de grace is the biergarten, with table after table in an excellent setting amongst the trees, ready for your enjoyment and partaking of one beer after another on a cool autumn evening (or any evening, really).  On the downside is that the food isn't quite ready yet and the kinks in the menu are being worked out, but there are plenty of options on their way. In the meantime, try the pretzels as you enjoy some refreshments brewed according to the purity laws of the Reinheitsgebot."}
{"text":"Fun! Great place to hangout and grab beers with a group! I only give it 4 stars not 5 because the picnic style seating is rather unconventional and my date had a 6'5\" guy leaning on here the whole time on accident and it was uncomfortable for her. Other wise it was a great experience and place!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is HUGE!! We didn't stay in much, mostly outside. We got our beers outside and walked around. They had some local vendors and we it was nice walking around and seeing everything. After we did some window shopping we decided to sit by the fire pit. This place is great. You can eat inside. Lots of beer selections. The decor is nice. Overall, we had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Giant brewery with tons of space. Good German food and things to keep you busy. A true German beer garden!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food! Huge biergarten  outside and large communal tables indoor like you would expect. Brats were awesome and some of the best spatsel I have had! Good portion for a great price!"}
{"text":"Wow! From the moment you pull in you will be in awe of the building and grounds. They even have a cute parking lot if that's possible. With a large Beer garden outside and the typical beer hall feel inside you will feel like you are in Munich!  I tried the Currywurst and opted for the Spätzle instead of fries. They did not disappoint! I tried two of the beers made on site and they were okay. I wouldn't say they were better than other breweries in the area but he combination of the German delights and the beer was top notch.   I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent here and I plan on coming back. I see from previous reviews that they have some cool festivals and I plan on coming to Oktoberfest for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful facility, wonderful beer . Terrible service. Food hasn't arrived yet . Ordered a beer for the wife and me, never arrived.  Hard time flagging down wait staff. They really need to get a good restaurant consultant in here before they lose a lot of customers.    New waitress took over and food did arrive and it was good.  Not fantastic but good.  For the price it should be fantastic.  Hope they get it right.  I like supporting local food and drink"}
{"text":"I am a fan of micro breweries and having local breweries when visiting an area.  The beers were very good. I had a flight (small glasses of the four beers for $3) that consisted of the Fruehbock, the Captain James Jack Pilsner, the OMB Copper and the Winter - Dunkel (dark) Lager. My favorite was the Dunkel, but I thought they were all delicious. I wish I had made it in time to go on the free brewery tour. I also like how they offer the ability to buy refillable growlers of their beer."}
{"text":"Holy diver this was the worst f*cking meal I've eaten in a long time. I would like to preface this by saying maybe this was the ONE time it sucked and by pointing out I DID eat all of my food. Maybe that's why I'm so damn p*ssed off. I was so hungry I ate every bite of my garbage sandwich. Usually the whole 'starving' thing makes anything taste good.  We walk in and the place is beautiful. Seat ourselves and a super friendly waitress (who is clearly in the weeds) comes over pretty quick and takes our order of beer, sweet tea and crab dip. Sweet tea was good, husband says beer is good. Crab dip arrives 30 minutes later and is also good. I attribute this exclusively to butter. Unfortunately the bread is BURNED (turns out this is intentional). We ask for untoasted bread and give our dark brown crap back. We order two sandwiches.  Waitress leaves. We finish our drinks and sit with empty cups and no bread our sandwiches come. The edges of the meat in my sandwich are burned and my husband says his sandwich tastes like it was made hours ago and has just been sitting there waiting to be ordered. We finish our food and THEN get our refills. Still no bread. Drink more. The bread comes. It's burned like the first round possibly a shade lighter. Possibly. (so I guess it's intentional but ugh). Bill of $46 of the worst dollars I ever spent shows up. We pay tip and leave.  I am so damn furious for having sat through that bullsh*t. This review would be incomplete without profanity. Utter garbage. Waitresses were super nice but totally overwhelmed.   If you want to sit in a beautiful place and drink cold beer come to OMB. It is a brewery after all.  If you're hungry go anywhere else in Charlotte. The food at OMB sucks so bad. You have been warned!!!   If OMB invited me back for a free meal as the only patron in the restaurant to make up for the experience I just had I would decline. The food was that terrible.  The one star is for the serving staff who was, again, really nice, otherwise no stars.  Annie O"}
{"text":"Beautiful space with amazing outdoor area...beer is decent. Heard they have best brewery tour in town and lines for tour say that is true! Will look forward to your in near future."}
{"text":"Three stars only beacuse the food selection is average. The beer is great and the ambience is amazing, especially the outdoor fire pit area.  What a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some local craft beer. Highly recommend the copper and dunkel!"}
{"text":"OMB is great! The beer is awesome, the taproom is warm and inviting and the staff is very welcoming and helpful. The few (very few) bad reviews I've read on this site about OMB are ridiculous. The place is great! If you're a fan of fresh beer, then I recommend you get down there ASAP! Support local beer!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars, but with some very worthy additions!   1) The Christmas Market is so much fun! Local merchants, delightful eats and, of course, plenty of beer. Fun for the whole family...except for the beer, if the kids are under age.   2) Their private room is fabulous. Check it out! I hear it fits about 80 people...company party anyone?!  3) Live music! Over the summer and as of late, OMB has done a great job of hosting super cool events like a cornhole tournament and live music at the tasting room. Go.   4) Food. Yup. Now they have a bit of German food to stave off hunger while you're trying their super fresh beer. Brats and more from a very casual food window. Nom nom.   Now I just gave you four more reasons to check out OMB if you haven't already. Prost!"}
{"text":"There beer is A1 top shelf and the Reuben is out of this world. Staff is awesome and the ratio isn't too bad either there's some bad honeys here"}
{"text":"Rocking joint. I'm relocating to Charlotte and intend to become a regular at Old Meck. Thoroughly enjoyed the brew. The Dunkel was my favorite. Mecktoberfest was a blast. All the food was yummy, and paired nicely :). Great service, I appreciated that they didn't make the bartenders dress in skimpy little outfits."}
{"text":"This could be my favorite place in Charlotte. Fantastic atmosphere. Wonderful beers. Food both inside and outside is good. This is a must visit when you're in town."}
{"text":"What A great find! Loved the family style seating and service was great, friendly, fast, and accommodating. Their food was delicious, and the beers did not disappoint. Ask about a beer flight if you're not sure which brew floats your boat. Highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"My family and friends all love coming here. Great large outdoor space, great German food and most importantly, a GREAT selection of brews.   I always get Mectoberfest, named after the county in which the brewer exists. It's a perfect ale with a smooth finish - no bitterness or horrible aftertaste.   Parking is plenty even tho it seems a bit difficult to find a spot sometimes. There are several lots in the immediate area if you're not lucky enough to find a spot in their lot.   Outdoor area has several large tables, some covered with umbrellas to shade you from the beaming sun. While outside, you'll see kids of all ages running around, people with dogs enjoying good conversations. There's a venue with a limited selection of foods and a bar selling the beers on draft - all located outside! I especially enjoy the cooler nights when the bonfire is lit and you can stand in a circle of people you can get to know or just hang with the group you came with.   The staff is always on top of it. There's people picking up empty glasses every 3 minutes. And if you decide to eat off their full food menu, you can enjoy outdoor seating or indoors by the bar and kitchen. Every waitress we've had over the course of the million times we've been here are always prompt and courteous.   This place is by far my favorite place to hang out."}
{"text":"Great beers, atmosphere, and service! We enjoyed the sausage trio. They are not made in house but are from a local purveyor. The wings were okay but, the sauce was a bit runny and not sticking to the wings very well."}
{"text":"Good classic beers, the set up of the place is phenomenal, flights of beer are the way to go. Was not able to try the food, but have heard great things about it."}
{"text":"Good food. Red cabbage side was tasty and sweet. Tried the 6 beer flight and it was just ok. Porter was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the outdoor garden. Pretzel was so delicious! The outdoor space was casual and had several back yard games that were in shady spots. I really enjoyed both the wheat ale and the Pilsner. Bother very refreshing beers on a hot day. The bathrooms were clean and well maintained. Overall great beer, food, and space. Will plan to go back if we are ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of OMB since they premiered in 2009. Their beer has come a long way and is still in a state of evolution. If you've yet to try it, stop by the brewery for your first taste.  The tap room is styled like the Bavarian bierhaus, with wood community tables, high open-beamed ceilings, and lots of dark wood panels. Don't arrive expecting expansive walls of TVs...it's a brewery tap room, not a sports bar. But you can expect great service from the friendly staff. Pop in on the weekends and you can get a 45 minute \"tour\" of the brewery. You don't get to really wander the warehouse, but you can come face-to-face with the machinery and learn about the history of OMB and their beer making process - great afternoon if you have a beer-lover visiting for the weekend!  The beer itself is generally good. Copper, their flagship, has been hit-or-miss for me, but their seasonal releases are where the good stuff is at. They have German-inspired snacks from the kitchen, too.  OMB was the catalyst for Charlotte's craft beer explosion - stop by and see where it all began."}
{"text":"I liked the place.  Food was ok, beer was pretty good.  I'd avoid the dunkel.  The fruh bock is where it's at.  Copper is pretty good too.  It's all open seating at big bench tables, so pop a squat."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great atmosphere good food and reasonable prices (or a bier garten more specifically) this should be a first stop in Charlotte. Pity I always come here in the cold months, but it's enjoyable never the less. Highly recommend the pork schnitzel or crab cake sandwich. So good!"}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal and the food and beers were so good! Need to go there and it's right off interstate 77."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, food is terrific with tons of choices. Staff are very knowledgeable and will help you through the German food maze. The selection of beer is top notch without a doubt. Look for the limited edition brews."}
{"text":"Chances are, you've never experienced a place like this. The atmosphere is laid back with either rock music casually playing or live music. You can stand by the bar, get a growler to go (Growlers, esp. refills are crazy cheap) or just pick a spot inside or out. The servers are very calm and relaxed and just float between tables to help when needed. They're now open for lunch during the week too so it's kind of nice to go relax in there. The tours, which are on the weekend are completely free and really enlightening. I'd suggest checking it out!"}
{"text":"Haven't made it to the actual brewery yet but i plan on it soon. There are two local bars that have there beers and im a huge fan of the OMB copper ale. It taste great and i love how local it is. I drink red oak often but love the fact that there is a brewery here in charlotte doing something right. Cant wait to come check it out."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Out of all the many breweries in Charlotte, this is definitely my favorite. I always take visitors here, as many locals do. I love the markets and events that are always here as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Charlotte for a few years and have visited OMB several times. Today we finally took a tour of the new location and it was awesome! Josh was a fantastic tour guide....super informative and passionate about their German style beer. We can't wait for the summer to spend time outside in their biergarten."}
{"text":"I'm slightly torn on the Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. It was nice, but it had a few pros and cons.  The Venue: The structure and atmosphere of the building is nice. It is spacious with lots of different places to sit, traditional German long bench seating for larger groups, and plenty of standing space. It was dimly lit with a laid back atmosphere.   The table we sat at was very dirty, it took a while for the waitress to notice us, but when she did - she was VERY attentive to our needs and would even come running over to us when we just looked at her.   The Beer: They had a small selection of various of beers, and from the 3 I had, I really loved one and didn't like the other 2 nearly as much. The Dunkel(I think) was my favorite as it had a unique creaminess that went well with the rich roasted flavor, the others (I think it was the Copper) had a cheap tinny taste to it. It was the day before Easter and it was busy, so they had ran out of 1-2 of their beers, but the Bar Tenders were very nice about it.  The Food: We came in late so we only got appetizers and it was probably the most disappointing. I got the pretzel with cheese sauce (for extra money) and the pretzel was tough, hard, and crispy (However, this MIGHT be the Traditional german style pretzel? I've been to one other german brewery and the food was similar quality) and the cheese was very poorly crafted. The roux in the cheese was cooked too quickly which made the whole sauce more of the consistency of oatmeal, which made the whole thing kind of gross and disappointing since it was $2 extra. Someone else got the wings at the table and they were adequate but nothing special.   Overall, Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is a decent place to drink, It's not the best nor worse. I would definitely go back, and would also recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"This place keeps growing and growing (aka getting better and better).  I recently moved about almost two years now, but every time I am back in town I make it a point to stop into OMB if even just for a afternoon brew.  I love all the changes and the fact that the menu has more to offer, you can find anything to suit any appetite.  Every time I also bring my dog who is allowed to stay outside and sit with us while we eat!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great location. Wonderful beer garden, good beer, good people and good food. They also service wine, which is quite good. Around the Christmas time they also have a pretty \"boring\" Christmas market and tend to run out of \"Glühwein\" before the real party time starts. And dont mention the food at the Christmas market, or rather the waiting time. Their system is ridiculous and needs improvement. You go purchase tickets at ONE stand where people also get in line for their drinks and then with that ticket you go to a diff. stand to finally order your food where there is no organized line and people just gather around there and where one single guy overwhelmingly takes your orders. Once the food is ready you are already too full from drinking beer or you no longer remember what you ordered. But based on my full star rating, I am not linking the Christmas market failure with the concept of OMB! I love this place and will enjoy riding my bike there in the summer. Prost!"}
{"text":"HUGE property - lots of tables and shade umbrellas  - even a section off to the side that allows smoking. Then inside halls are BIG - really tall ceilings - like a true german beer hall.  And the food is pretty good. I liked my burger. And my sister and her husband liked their brats and traditional german side foods.  Good service from a friendly staff. ok there was one bar back clearing tables that didnt look too happy but he was 16 maybe 17 so what can you expect.  speaking of kids - we were there in the middle of the afternoon on a saturday and saw LOTS of whole families there. cant tell you anything about the beers cuz I dont drink but I do know ( from watching it happen) they will let you sample as many samples as you need to in order to find your beer. so over all I am happy to give em 4 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out, super relaxed."}
{"text":"Came here after work in early February to meet up with the mouse for a quick beer and bite before our alumni board meeting held there later that evening.  Don't you wish all meeting were held at breweries?   Anyways, we tried the four brats special.  I liked how it was served up on disposal dish ware with plastic utensils.  I really do - matches the feel of the place.  Food is secondary to beer!  The brats all tasted pretty good, but enjoyed the Kielbasa with spicy mustard.    I wish the bartender-server keyed us into some options, if any, that come with the brats - would've loved some kraut or extra fixings.  Maybe that's now how brats are served, but with the overload of just brats, probably could've cooked me up as the next brat that's how purely stuffed I was after that.  (There was some bread, but mouse always takes my bread).  Also, they need to fix one of the rickety benches - when one board member shifted, we all shifted.  Drinking beer required careful balance - that doesn't go well together, obv.  Definitely coming back here though as Copper is my favorite beer... of all time!  Need to take a tour and find out how its made.  dmo out"}
{"text":"New brewery is awesome.  I love the new setup.  This is where I will be bringing friends when they come from out of town.  Very busy on opening day but I can imagine there will be lots of room once the \"buzz\" dies down.  A+"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, but a lot of my friends do; hence I hang out a breweries occasionally. The atmosphere here is great. There is a ton of space both inside and outside to chill, hang out with friends and have a few drinks. There are TVs at the bar, but no seating at the bar which is odd. Be prepared to stand if you want to watch a sporting event up close. Although it may be a little weird to critique a brewery for having a limited drink menu, it's a little disappointing that all they have is beer and two wines to choose from to drink. There's no cider or liquor options for the non-beer drinking friends who hang out in breweries. Now on to the food. The pretzels and beer cheese is good. I've had brats with sides a couple of times and it was just okay (nothing exciting). The last time I went I tried the spatzle, which was rather bland. Overall, the atmosphere is cool. I would hang out here if my friends really wanted to go, but it's not my favorite."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the beer is decent but honestly I don't get the hype. I love their Hornets Nest that's out but other than that the beers are just okay to me. It doesn't really have any differentiating flavors, in my opinion. Tip: if you are going to offer food, you should offer the same menu throughout the brewery. I understand it's a big place but something should be done to keep things equal."}
{"text":"The beer was great, however, the food...a Different story. I got the pork schnitzel and bratkaroffeln. I must say the pork was under seasoned and the potatoes were greasy. Good for beer...choose wisely for the food. Stick to more of the bar food as far as food faire"}
{"text":"A staple in Charlotte. OMB started the current wave of breweries in the area and is an absolute asset to the region. The beer is traditional German and you won't find any experimental fruity IPAs. Other area breweries may have better beers, but it's tough to top a lineup with Copper and seasonal beers like Fruh Bock, Dunkel, and Mecktoberfest.   The biergarten is a great space and it's a must-see for out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"This new location, opened last year, is so cool; it has long German style communal bar tables,a full length, stand-up bar running the length of the room, a whole wall of doors that open on to a huge courtyard where you can play games, visit the food trucks and vendors.   Join their newsletter if you want to know about the awesome events taking place. Crawfish fest is next week and I can't wait. Huge platters of crawfish, corn, potatoes and of course beer or wine. They always have fun bands to enjoy and we meet some great people-everyone is in such a festive mood!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. I'm sure people know about it, but I randomly came across it the other day. Someone mentioned that they are going to be relocating just down the street and they will be opening a beer garden. First thing I search for when I moved to Charlotte. Looking forward to many more visits here and more at the new location."}
{"text":"The good, decent beer tour.  The decent, better than average food offering.  The blah, young beer.    Being a craft beer lover, this brewery comes to me as a decent start to what will be good destination for many.  I thought the Copper (flag ship beer) was ok, and tasted a bit young for my taste.  The brewery brews beer according to the Reinheitsgebot purity law and restricts its ingredients to only 4.  After tasting the flight of beers I found that I did like the \"Fat Boy\" which is a good dark complex stout type beer.    While our tour was adequate intro into a young clean brewery, I will be interested to see how they fare over the next few years.    Good parking available, nice courtyard to relax in but as the place fills up it becomes harder and harder to get good service inside the place.  If you are hungry and it is after 1 p.m. stop and eat before coming to the brewery because it will become next to impossible to get food without a long wait."}
{"text":"OMB is a great place for food though I must say my burger came out with a little more pink in the middle than I had expected. But the other times I have been there the food was great! I especially loved though the marinated cucumber salad that came with it; I thought it was perfectly balanced with seasonings, wasn't too heavily spiced and had a nice crunch to it. The hummus and the chips were amazing....I couldn't get enough of the hummus....I would definitely recommend for someone to visit this restaurant next time they are in charlotte."}
{"text":"I stopped by The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery based on its proximity to Sugar Creek Brewing Company, which I had stopped by first for a quick drink. When I arrived at OMB I discovered a massive outdoor biergarten, which seemed like the perfect place to spend an evening. Once inside you will immediately notice the large dining room, however I headed straight to the bar. It was my goal to grab a bite to eat and a flight, however I knew that since the inside was packed that food would take a bit. Not to mention that there was no seating at the bar, so be advised the bar is standing room only.  I looked over the beer menu and inquired about a flight, much to my surprise a flight consisted of every one of each of their six beers available on tap. While I wasn't overly impressed with any of the beers, if I had to pick one I would say the best was probably a tie between their Southside Weiss, Captain James Jack Pilsner, and the Copper. I really didn't care much for the Mecktoberfest, which was average at best. The Hornets' Nest Hefeweizen was probably my least favorite.   OMB was a good stop, just not my favorite beer and the inside atmosphere was a bit too loud for my liking. It would be a perfect place for dinner and drinks or a quiet evening outside, however if you are just looking to relax and sit at the bar you might want to consider Sugar Creek instead."}
{"text":"Favorite brewery in Charlotte. Great meeting place for large groups. Sitting outside in the beer garden is a perfect thing to do on warm evenings!"}
{"text":"How fantastic of a wedding venue. I recently created the design for a beautiful bride who used the two back rooms for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. The staff was easy going, helpful, and quick to take charge and find solutions. Billeigh and Nicole our on-site coordinators were knowledgable and kind. The space itself is fantastic, and lends itself to all types of decor. My bride went for garland, candles and art for her decor - and it turned out more beautifully than each of us imagined. The food at OMB is also fantastic - their catering menu includes some delicious options like kielbasa, mac & cheese, and their in-house brews. Highly recommend hosting events and weddings here, or just stopping by for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is capital 'A'' Awesome! Great beer, great food, great service! They have indoor seating, where you can get the full menu, and lots of outdoor seating, where you can get a simplified menu and beer. Lots of dogs, families, friends, musicians just hang out outside. The German fare is delicious. Start off with a pretzel. Gets lots to drink, eat, and be merry!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here... even when there's large events, there's plenty of seating, food, and beer. Very kid & dog friendly."}
{"text":"This spot seems like an absolutely superb atmosphere! Like every other comment says, there is a great outdoor space. It is very kid friendly and dog friendly. They have an outdoor bar and tons of tables as well. The inside has plenty of seating, very clean and nice bathrooms, and even a space for private parties. We didn't get any food, just some beers. There were only 5 beers on tap, which is the reason for me giving it a 4-star. I'm sure that's the \"German\" way though, so disregard me.   I'm sure their tours would be cool, but I have no idea when they go on. I'd check the place out though for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is huge!  I have never been here before, I don't know how I missed it after all these years, but I did.  There is a great outside area that can easily fit an abundance of people without feeling too crowded.  The indoor area is the same.  They have TVs situated in different areas of the bar, which is nice for game days.    I went on a weeknight, kind of late, so it wasn't really busy at all.  I'm sure that it gets packed.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap.  The staff seems nice, just not very personable-but sometimes all you need is nice and efficient anyway, so no complaints.  I would love to try again soon."}
{"text":"Best large scale brewery in clt which has a good selection of German style  beers and good events. This is the perfect location for a large group outing."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for microbreweries but this 5 star review goes beyond \"cool because its local small business\".   The Copper is delicious, and I order it almost every time I have the opportunity (we also have one of their refillable carboys, so having this at home has become beyond cheap). 6 months ago, you could find it in a tiny handful of local restaurants and bars - now, there are upwards of 40 places serving OMB. Awesome.  The Pilsner we sampled Saturday was good, too - tart, a little floral - and they're supposedly releasing a Bock this week. Which is also awesome.  Additional awesomeness, and a reason to visit  - the space is open, airy, but comfy - high stools and tables, high backed booths, easy, friendly service. Despite being hidden in a somewhat industrialized area off of South blvd, I could hang here all day. Especially if they got some Veg Brauts out there on the cart.  The tour was rad because, well, hey, you're surrounded by a sea of delicious beer, but other than that - it was interesting to learn that OMB imports all their grain from Germany, meaning that what goes into the brew is high quality stuffs. The tour was given (and is often given, says he) by a dude from the CLT Homebrewer's Association, awesome thing number gazillion.  Our first microbrewery! Go and give them money, now."}
{"text":"Had a random Tuesday afternoon free in Charlotte, so being the beer lover I am, I yelped breweries in the area and the OMB popped up.  They were open from 4 to 8pm and apparently Tuesday is pint night (discounted beers).  It was pretty easy to find, just look for all the cars!  I was doing this outing solo, so it was kind of nerve racking that there were so many people there, but I can't blame them....nice weather and good brews, I'd be there too if I lived in the area!  The inside is a big open room decorated in German beer hall style with picnic tables, and smaller tables for couples (or just me) with more seating outside.  I got a sampler platter of the 5 beers they had on tap.  Three ounce tastings of 5 beers for $3...not bad!  My favorite was the wheat, but they were all pretty good.  You can also buy growlers and have them refilled for a low cost, wish more bars would do this!  I checked out the menu, and reluctantly decided against the bratwurst panini....it looked good =)    They are open most evenings with free tours on Saturdays.  While being in a crowded brew hall solo was a little weird, I'm glad I ventured out to taste some of the beers Charlotte has to offer.  This place would be a great week day hang out for friends or family."}
{"text":"Solid beers. Good food. Lots of German-esque food, but not necessarily mainstream German. Their rotkohl, has some twists, such as apples, but still tasty. If you're looking for fruity or off-beat craft beers, this isn't your place, but for classically made German style beers, this is a great spot. The beers are very reminiscent of being in Germany.   I will say, their pretzel is good, but I don't recommend the beer cheese. It's not a smooth cheese, very gritty."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious beers. Awesome outdoor area. Delicious brats and bar food. It's no wonder people love this place!  I went here for the first time this weekend and I think I will have to make it a must-go for every trip to Charlotte. Even though it was packed, we found seats quickly and the service was awesome. I got the turkey reuben (which was great), but I ended up wishing I had gotten one of the brat plates. My husband shared his with me and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good beer and great venue. As a childless person this is my go to place to meet up with friends who do have kids. We all can relax with some good beer while the kids run wild. The food truck is decent - not amazing but does the job.  The curry sauce for the fries is a go to. The pretzels are a nice side for the beer, a little dry but doesn't stop anyone from continuing to take bites! The chicken wings are spicy - so you keep drinking that beer!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a gift card. Nice selection of craft beer so baldie had the Copper and he liked it. I had a sweet tea, beer is nasty as shit. I ordered honey sriracha wings which were pretty good and some kind of BBQ wings that had no flavor of BBQ whatsoever. They tasted bland.  It came with a sloppy array of the usual suspects, carrots and celery. Nope. Baldie had the Pretzel melt. If you're hungry get two,  because it's small. It was good but I don't know where the \"melt\" was. I barely tasted cheese. Frank's side he chose was cucumber salad and I loved it. It was cool and fresh and tangy with vinegar. Frank wasn't crazy about the herb in it. I think it was either thyme or oregano or both. The fries tho, delicious! Crispy and hot!! The server got lost towards the end  and couldn't find her. I don't know if I'd go back tho. I'm not a beer drinker and menu didn't do much for me. I'd go back for frank. Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you order a schnitzel, keep in mind that they do not really serve schnitzels. They serve a sausage patty sized cutlet which they call a schnitzel. A real German Wienerschnitzel should be so large that it takes up the entire plate, and often in Germany you get two massive ones on the same plate. Of course this is not really a German restaurant, but since they present themselves as one, it should be made clear that it is not really an authentic German schnitzel that is served. Not that this is a complaint, since a complaint involves vested emotional interest. Just an objective constructive criticism, because this is a great place otherwise and such a small but vital improvement could take it over the top to be a really hopping place. In fact the flavor was quite tasty as well as the spaetzle that was served with it. Of course I understand wanting to cut some corners and save on the cost of meat. But it just seems unnecessary when this place could be somewhat authentically German."}
{"text":"OMB has done a wonderful job with the new location. You can tell that a lot of careful thought was put into every detail and it leads to a beautiful space that you want to spend time in. I can see this being a wonderful event space, weddings in that beirgarten would be amazing!   My only complaint about the decor is that there is very little lighting outside. Servers came around and lit candles inside of cute lanterns that sit on the tables but they didn't provide much light. I think that space would look AMAZING if they had old fashioned christmas lights strung throughout the umbrellas, this would really add some charm and much needed light.   I only tried the pretzel with beer cheese, but they have some work to do. The beer cheese had very little cheese flavor and was grainy. Maybe my standards are too high because I will compare every beer cheese to VBGB, but I think they can do better.   Since they are still getting their footing the food took awhile to be served. I would say it was almost 30-40 mins before burgers and bratwursts arrived after we ordered them. I am sure that will improve as they get into the swing of things.   It goes without saying that the beer still tastes great, I have no complaints here!   I look forward to spending lots of time here, it is a beautiful location."}
{"text":"Finally got back over to OMB the other night. Love this place! I'm a huge fan of Copper but I tried a couple others on Thursday that were pretty tasty. The Dunkel, a nice dark lager, was very nice. I also tried RPA and liked that one too. They've added a fire pit out front and have added a small kitchen inside (the first time I ever visited they had a guy outside cooking up brats). I didn't have any food while I was there but someone told me the brats were still out of this world. They also serve up the large pretzels. Located in an industial park between South Blvd & S. Tryon, it's a bit of a hall to get over there for me, but when I have a reason to be on that side of town, I'm always looking to stop by for a brew."}
{"text":"What can you say about OMB that hasn't already been said? This place is such a fantastic spot to hang out with friends in the beirgarten enjoying those cold German brews! Some German food to boot! Got a chance to stop by this past weekend and experience  their Mecktoberfest festivities. This brewery knows how to do it right!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that OMB doesn't fill growlers from outside sources. Are they more interested in selling glass or beer? Ridiculously poor environmental decision on their part."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet! This is by far my favorite brewery to visit, drink at, and eat at in Charlotte. Their beer is the best in the city and food is awesome! I've been here tons of times and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the beer, love the biergarten, but I've only had pretzels and bratwurst here. Both were really good. On a gorgeous sunny afternoon this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The best brewery in Charlotte! They're not my favorite local beer but that beer garden though!  I had the pretzel with the beer cheese...OMG!  They have the food truck and everything looks great!  I was surprised to see frost warning on tap since it's seasonal.  Jam session is my favorite! If you haven't been here...you should definitely come out and try it."}
{"text":"From the first OMB beer we ever tried  we loved it and then we went to the brewery and we loved it even more!  The beer is awesome, the food is awesome! The servers are friendly and knowledgeable about what they are serving.   We have nothing but love for OMB!!  So we had our wedding here!"}
{"text":"First of all this place is so much larger than I expected! Which is a good thing because it is so cool that practically everybody wants to be there. But seriously what a great space OMB is!! The outdoor area has rows and rows of picnic tables nestled under huge trees with umbrellas and firepits and so much room to roam. It has a great park like feel and people could really pack in there in huge numbers but at the same time it's very spacious and feels very spread out. On a cold winter weekend there was a child's birthday party going on in one corner, a gathering of adults for a party in another, countless groups scattered all over around wood fires and portable heaters. You can see where they have an outdoor bar and foodtruck type area for busier, warmer times and I cannot wait to go back!!   The brewery and restaurant itself also has a huge interior and a covered porch with outside dining service overlooking the biergarten. We dined outside here and the service was quick for both beers and food. Definitely start with a pretzel and be sure to add the beer cheese! Also had conch fritters and a cheeseburger, both of which were tasty and plentiful in servings.   There is a decent amount of street parking but more importantly they have a large parking lot tucked behind the facility that is super convenient and just a short walk inside. You will actually walk past their hops garden and then through the biergarten which makes for a good entrance and intro to the place!   We went there for the beer and food but would love to return for a brewery tour and see what all they have to offer because I know we missed a lot!"}
{"text":"Man...this was a tough one to consider. I was teetering between 1 or 2 stars and finally landed on a 1.5, but rounded up to be generous.  On my most recent road-trip, I spent an overnight in Charlotte and was excited to see all the great reviews of the Olde Meck. I was really stoked to check it out for myself.   Let's take a moment to discuss all the coolness about Olde Meck... -MASSIVE dog friendly beer garden. Ample seating, live music, and plenty of shade. -The beers were spot on. I tried most of the available beers and the majority were pretty damned good. -Now, I have always thought the ladies of my former hometown, Austin TX, to be some of the most lovely women on this planet...but after a night in Charlotte, I think I may have to reconsider that. I have never seen such an abundance of absolutely stunning ladies in one space.  And now the not so cool about Olde Meck... -Service lacks, um...what's that word? Oh, personality...with the exception of one solitary beer puller at the outside bar, everyone working there had the personality and warmth of a ice cube. Most of the staff seemed a little put out that they had to deal with the public. -Food was, well, let's call it 'utilitarian' for lack of a more appropriate, yet less insulting term. If you sit outside, you are limited to what they serve out of the food truck. We waited about an hour for our pretzels. Our brats came up in record (45 minutes) time. The brats were bland and cold. The German potato salad was about the only worthwhile bite. The broetchen were sad little pretzel bun nuggets...hard and kinda gross. The only mustard choice was Gulden's...not even a decent German mustard to throw a little flavor onto the bland brats. The pretzels, that we waited an hour for, made me cry a little. No crust, mushy, not very 'pretzel-y' at all. -Oh...speaking of the food truck and service. While standing there getting my fake pretzel, a young lady received her burger (after almost an hour of waiting) and opened it to apply condiments. I happened to be next to her and the bun was burnt. Not toasted, charred, or brown, but flat out blackened and sooty. She asked (politely I may add) if she could have a new bun. The response was flabbergasting. It was a very rude and curt \"No\". She explained that she had waiting for some time and that at the price she paid, this was not acceptable. After a short back and forth with the staff unwilling to help her in any way, she asked to speak to someone in charge, and was told \"If you want to talk to a manager, then go inside and find one\".  I can put up with the mediocre food, because of the decent beers and the great outdoor space, but the substandard service and staff attitude take away from what could be a great experience. My tip...pop in for a beer, but then head out to any number of other nearby breweries to hang out."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and never a disappointment! No only are the staff, beer and food excellent, but the atmosphere too. We try different sausages each time and I love the sauerkraut. We even had the Hummus this trip- yum! And shout out to the manager on 6/25/18. I was not having a great day and she bought us our beverages, there is still good in the world! Every trip back is a joy!"}
{"text":"Great beer I love the Belgian style beers and the purity rules. This brewery has it going on. Also the food is great. Nice outside seating and plenty of things going on with a good crowd."}
{"text":"I like the beer.  I was at a bar drinking the OMB beer and read the reviews of the Brewery and thought I'd try it out.  MISTAKE.  Only a dozen people there, 5 of which were 5yo and under running around making it their personal play pen.  The oblivious parents did nothing.  The kids were running between my legs and behind the bar.  I hinted to the one bimbos working there that it was very annoying and she just giggled.  Screw that!!!  I left with half of a pint of good beer going to waste.  A place that lets this go on deserves no business.  Oh...2 choices of beer.  Whooo hoo... back to the bar but never back here"}
{"text":"One of the first breweries in Charlotte and definitely one of the biggest. If you have not been here before prepared to be amazed! They have a TON of space here so grab a free parking spot and head on in to enjoy a cool refreshing Copper and some brats!   They have a German inspired ambience as well as beer line up and food menu. There is plenty of seating outside and inside they even have wait service! There is something here for everyone so bring the whole family! Don't be surprised by how packed it is and also don't worry! Service is always fast and respectful.   OMB paved the way for the brewery scene in Charlotte and is continuing to expand. Expect to find their beers at all the bars in Charlotte and even at your local grocery store."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of OMB. It seems to be over of the most popular breweries, but I don't know many people that like it.   I'm not a beer fan, so I can't personally speak for the beer. Compared to most breweries now, they are lacking in non-beer options. They have two wanted to choose from, but they don't have any cider or kombucha. As for the beer, I've heard complaints both from people who aren't big fans of German beer and those that love German beer that it just isn't very good beer.   The beer garden is pretty awesome. The food is also pretty good. Parking is a nightmare even though they added all of the additional lots. They put on a very good Christmas market on weekends in December.   OMB isn't my brewery of choice and I usually only go if someone else scheduled a happy hour there."}
{"text":"The best brewery I have ever been to. We are visiting from out of town and looked up a brewery that was open for lunch. Not only were the two young woman bartenders VERY informative, helpful and friendly but they made our visit memorable, pleasant, and comfortable. We had chicken wings and pretzels. The food was great and the beers were even better!!! You must visit here!!!"}
{"text":"I like the pretzels, have not go tried anything beyond that but will return to get my drink on! The establishment is very open and clean with great outdoor seating, also the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgable staff. Open and spacious environment. Overall, a great place to sit down and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"The facility here is absolutely beautiful. The architectural vibe, the decor, and the overall aesthetics make you feel like you may have just teleported to Munich.  The parking is ample and the grounds are kept spotless. There is a ton of outdoor seating (although not filled up due to it being frigid when I came with friends yesterday), but fire pits are outside, as well as space heaters. Some people were braving the cold. It is surely an extremely popular location in warmer weather to enjoy your beers. There were a lot of people packed into the back room/bar area, including several children and families on this Sat. night. Crowd remained well behaved until getting louder as the evening went on.   There is some remodeling going on at this time, but they have controlled the chaos to where it is minimally noticeable when you are in the back room. The bartenders were almost all nice except for one individual. Not sure who it was, but she did not seem like she was normally behind the bar anyway. Her attitude we could have gone without, but everyone else was friendly and attentive with service.   They have a food menu that is full of traditional selections, but I had some of the hummus appetizer platter.  Service was prompt and food was fresh. I stuck with the Pilsner last night, which was a crisp and light choice of beer for the evening.   Good place overall, will return with friends at some point I am sure."}
{"text":"Good not great.  I enjoyed the beers I had here but I didn't really care for the place.  It's an unique setup.  High ceilings, big long tables where you sit down with strangers to eat and drink (which ended up being a lot of fun).  The bar is HUGE but there are no stools.  I was told that's the \"european style\" - you stand at the bar.  Weird.  Guess my American-centric brain just can't get wrapped around how that would be fun....  They have a good location and a good variety of beers, too.  The prices aren't incredible - $5-6 for a pint - but that's ok.  If you're up for some good beer and making new friends, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brewery in CLT so far. The outdoor space is massive and there are countless tables so you'll always find a seat. Also, there are grassy areas where you'll see families sitting on blankets or throwing a Frisbee. Furbabies are welcome in the outdoor area.   We've never had a bad meal here. I had the salmon Caesar salad that was out of this world. Usually salmon ends up too well-done for me, but OMB cooked it perfectly. Whenever I order salmon I compare it to here.  The outdoor space has a limited menu so we had to eat inside. Seemed like a shame on such a beautiful day."}
{"text":"I can't really say much about the place. I didn't really get to explore the place because I was there for a meeting with my job and we were in the meeting room. I can say the place seems very interesting and if I was a beer drinking I would definitely return to explore. The place is also very very clean. We did have food provided by the brewery it was okay nothing to brag home about. The lemonade however was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to visit, when we went they were revamping the menu so they were limited on what was available because 3 days later they were rolling out something new... the pretzel we had was excellet so hopefully they kept it. Great place to hang w/friends or bring people from out of town, didnt do the tour but would go back. Great service and love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"It was pretty busy the day we arrived and waited for a seat to open. Most seats are in communal long tables tables where you sit with other patrons. The table we sat at was dirty. After we saw the waitress take a menu and brush off a table for another recently seated group; we asked if our table could be wiped. The waitress said yes but no cleaning cloth was ever produced.    Our food selections were ok to good - the schnitzel was good but side was meh and the Reuben was not bad.  The German beers were definitely the highlighted of the visit - really good Hefeweizen."}
{"text":"This is my type of place, love the atmosphere and the crowd. A great mix of old and young. The only thing I did not like is that you cannot make reservations (at least that's what they told me on the phone) but when we showed up most of their tables were reserved for large parties. There is no waiting list, so you really just have to stalk people to get a table.   Got a great tip while we were there, you can't order food from a waiter unless you have a table, but you can order from the bar and they will bring it to where you find a place to stand. We were about to leave before I saw a group next to us do this and it worked perfectly!  I got the kielbasa bratwurst which is served with a preztel roll and mustard. I really enjoyed that and the pretzel appetizer with the captain jack beer cheese. The cheese was probably my favorite part if I had to choose, but I also love cheese... I also saw the pizzas coming out and those looked pretty good as well.   I tried the OMB Copper and Captain Jack beer. I preferred the Copper as it had more flavor, but I usually don't drink pilsners like Captain Jack.   Wait staff and patron alike were very friendly. Unless you have a secret reservation could be hard to snag a table onto a Friday night, but that's to be expected. I would definitely go back and try different beers and check out the tour!"}
{"text":"They have great beer. Bottom line. I love the space that the brewery has both inside and out. The inside is akin to a German brewhaus, cozy with a huge bar. The outside just had tons of picnic tables. They have fire pits in the winter which is nice. I know they get really busy there on the weekends, but I'm taking away a star only because a couple of the bartenders seemed less than enthused to serve beer. Also the food for the most part was very good, just a little cold. All around great place that I'll go back to again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place and love that they have added more seating outside! Came for the LOSO block party and stayed for beers and brats.  They had a live band and each of the surrounding breweries had a tent with their beer, even on OMB property which we thought was nice."}
{"text":"Dan wanted to give a four star, even with no IPA (not a German style beer).   We came by for a quick lunch. This place is huge. Huge. They must host many outdoor beer garden events and there is ample seating inside.   Beer was good. We split a pizza and caprese salad on the recommendation of the server, not sure why we did that in a German eatery. We were not too hungry and wanted to share a meal. I did try the cabbage and that was good and reminded me of what I had in Germany.   We'd visit again and be sure to stop by when the local distilleries are open."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the fact they do event. They have parties and you can have your party there. Love the fact you can take some beer home and put it in the frig. Beers you just cant get in the store. Look forward to seeing the new place"}
{"text":"Love love love the new beir garden. Friendly staff and the best beer going. The sample plates are also amazing. Love that we can also bring the dogs, even if it is outside. Would love to see some live music even if its just a low key open mic"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I came here to watch the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. Germany vs. Argentina. The OMB will only be like that once every four years. But when it is, it's AWESOME. Everyone is predominantly German, and very, very, very excited. The beer is good, pretty cheap, the finger food hits the stop, and the place is beautiful. High ceilings, tall windows, and wood panel everywhere. World Cup 2018. You should be there."}
{"text":"Hands down to the best and fun brewery in Charlotte. OMB is huge and has plenty of sitting areas for everyone. A bar, with tables and more space in the back or even outside. There is interesting decor with mugs inside. They offer the brewery tour which is interesting. Definitely a good place for family and friends to hang out.  Came here for the first time on Saturday afternoon and it was quite packed. I absolutely liked the vibe. Great beer, centrally located, good atmosphere - a solid craft brewery experience.   I was really surprised by how good the service was considering how busy the place was. Bartenders work fast and generally friendly. Everyone was knowledgeable about the beer to help you pick from all the variety. I would recommend Mecktoberfest and snack with their pretzel and beer cheese. Four stars for some dishes that didn't quite right to me.   Don't forget to grab a six pack of your favorite beer on the way out $9.99!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place!  All of the beers are very good - try a sampler.  Or ask the bartenders for a taste until you find the perfect brew for you.  The pretzels and beer cheese are excellent.  Great happy hour crowd.  The biergarten looks like it would a great place to hang out in the spring or fall... but in July it was a bit hot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the week and have decide to make it a beer tour as well.  This first stop on the trip.  Came in at dinner time and started with a Copper, which was very tasty.  Ordered dinner, German Brat with potato salad (very nice) and a Southside Weiss.  Beer was great as was the food.  Additionally, there is a huge outdoor beer garden with many tables, a dog area, corn hole, and about 50 people doing yoga (just go with it).  Overall, I highly recommend you stop here."}
{"text":"Great tap brews particularly of German background but has something for every beer lover. Food was high end pub food. I would go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breweries in Charlotte!  As other reviews have said, OMB is huge and has an amazing layout, allowing for several tables inside, event rooms and an amazing outdoor patio.  I guess I shouldn't call it a patio.   A full bar is located inside, where you can find several communal tables with TVs around. While inside you can enjoy food from an extensive food menu! Don't miss out on the pretzels, some of my favorites! As for outside, there is a full bar with several tables, under trees, in open spaces and conveniently located so you don't ever feel cramped.  OMB is kid and animal friendly so you will definitely see kids playing outside. They also have an OMB food truck outside that has some great treats, including pizza and other small bites.  The staff is always friendly and always seem to be enjoying their job.  One thing I love, you can open a tab at one bar but get a drink at any of the bars and use that same tab..great idea and convenience for their customers! Definitely looking forward to some great summer nights at OMB!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good brews! Olde Meck is a staple in Charlotte for a good reason. I tried the soft pretzel for an appetizer and had the Gouda panini for my meal. They were both good but not great. I definitely think the highlight of this place is the beer. It also is unfortunate that it closes at 10 on a Monday night, so you can't watch the whole Monday night football game."}
{"text":"Best brewery by far, very kid friendly, lots of outdoor space and huge inside with big tables! Love this place the food is phenomenal !!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, (however i think they are moving to a new location soon).  The setting is of a old german brewhouse, which is very fun.  They serve food along side their brews.   The have the beer that they have available on a chalk board on the side of the rooms, make sure to check out the seasonal.  I recommend the \"hornets nest\" if available.       Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Also you can get 2 types of growlers to take beer with you."}
{"text":"Good Beer, great venue.  This has become my go to brewery location, since the location is great for me and the atmosphere is AWESOME for a tasting room.   You can tell alot of thought went into the building of this new facility.  Keythings to note: - Big open tap room - LOTs of outside seating (with games, and now outside beer taps) - Massive trees  - Great German theme - The food is great (at the very least get the preztels)  They normally have 3 of their standards on tap and 2-3 rotating types of seasonals. For the non-beer people, they do have wine on tap as well.   Great place to meet after work (or lunch!), or show off to the new-comers of the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of OMB since it's inception - Copper is my favorite beer and I was extremely disappointed when Total Wine stopped the large growler exchange.  I have mixed feeling about the size of crowds at OMB - I love to see a busy place, but I miss the intimacy of the brewery when it originally opened and we would be one of the few in the brew house, instead of one of the masses.    Copper is an excellent beer, one that is close to what I had in Düsseldorf a decade ago - rich, malty, and so smooth you just keep drinking and drinking till you realize your future self will be mad at you for the headache.  Captn Jack and the other beers are just mediocre - though the Dunkel and Hornets Nest are pretty good.  Our last visit was during the Christmas market, and if you can get over the horde of people, it was well setup with lots of options and stands that were not just junk.  As long as Copper keeps being brewed and tasting the same, I will keep drinking it!"}
{"text":"The new location adds more room and more German entrees for everyone who likes beer and great fun!"}
{"text":"Great beer, but a great location as well. It's like being in one of the German beer gardens. And I know because I've been to at least one or two.  Love love love the outside seating area. Very neat spot to sit and suck down some of their tasty brews.  Yes, the beer is good. I liked their Southwise Weiss and the Captain James Jack Pilsner which hit my palate quite nicely.  Oh, and speaking of palate, try the food menu. We had currywurste, cabbage and hummus. And a pretzel. Jeez, too much food! All decent stuff!  Yep, I like this place."}
{"text":"What a huge beer garden! They have a large courtyard with a large brewery! The beer is great and the place is well kept! This place has a wide selection of wheat and dark brews.  The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I didn't quite know what to order but I told them what I did and didn't like and they provided me with suggestions that were right on!  They offer food and the menu consists of a variety of food that accommodates the Beer.  I visited on a wednesday and there was a nice crowd. Very casual and warming. There is both outdoor and indoor seating. Parking is adajcent to the brewery and free. This is a great beer garden with lots of options for local beers. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to OMB, and it definitely surpassed my expectations. A friend and I met to get a drink and dinner. Their outdoor patio is massive - enough room for individuals like us to sit at long German bar tables plus one or two corporate events. They even had live music, which made for a nice touch.  The food was also good. I had a caprese sandwich. It's not a large menu (and I don't eat bratwurst or red meat), but the quality was good. Definitely a fun place to hang out, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First off, I generally do not like most US. micro breweries. With that said this place is different- it's ALL about the beer, and they have done a great job.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Old Meck (despite parking, but what can ya do?) It is a great place to gather and hang out with friends. Even though I lack a love of beer I still manage to find one I like. The food is good to and I love the outdoor pager system linked to the food truck.   I do wish they would let you order off the menu if you're sitting outside. We were told we couldn't, and had to stick with whatever the truck sold. Looking forward to this weekends crawfish bash!"}
{"text":"Great solid beers and a huge location with beautiful beer garden and lots of room to hangout."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for work recently and a local kindly recommended the The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. I had spent more than half a day on planes and was looking for a place with fresh air and cold beer where I could stretch out and catch up on my laptop.   I was blown away at what a pleasure Mecklenburg was. The taproom has a series of doors that open to the outside and the space itself is modern, clean, and comfortable. Large communal tables allow for a casual atmosphere and the service, in particular, was truly top notch. I started with the house Hefeweizen and the beer was cold and one of the best I've had.  As I sat and sipped my way through a couple pints, I saw some delicious looking plates coming out of the kitchen. I eventually decided to try the pretzel as an appetizer and one of their local sausages. I can highly recommend both! The sausage was flavorful and spicy, sauerkraut clearly homemade and very well balanced, and the roll was a perfect accompaniment.  I ended up spending a few hours in the late afternoon at Olde Mecklenburg and after a few outstanding beers and a great meal it is absolutely on my short list for the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this review because everyone and their mothers love OMB. And, it's nice. But our bartender didn't even listen to what we ordered, and he ended up pouring the wrong beer for my friend. We told another bartender, and she goes, \"Oh oops, well do you like it? You drank some already right?\" basically saying, Tough Luck, you're keeping it. We tried a few of the beers on tap, and they were all Meh. I mean, I'd definitely come back if a friend wanted to come here, but I won't go out of my way to do it.   I do really like the design of this place. I think it's amazing how much seating they have, standing room, a dining area, and a TON of seating outdoors."}
{"text":"Parking is gravel so wear comfy shoes. Otherwise an awesome place. especially to host a company gathering or private party. This place really has a lot of space, heck even a wedding would be awesome here. The beer is delicious. and tours are free at certain times of the day. Or you can pay for a group tour where you actually get to try what they are brewing. Food here is German themed, and awesome as well. Patio area is great with plenty of space and games like corn hole to play. So I would say its even good for kids. I recommend a visit to this local brewery. Places like this are making a come back and we should keep that alive! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Simple, laid back & very casual.  Copper is the best beer!! Food is good and service is quick. Plus they have FREE Yoga on Tuesday nights started by LuLuLemon. What could be better than yoga and beer??  Best tip about this place: they have \"OMB coins\" that you use like money - as if you're a leprechaun or 10yrs old in an arcade - so fun!!"}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous brewery! Lots of open space, you can bring kids & dogs, theres tables inside and outside, often have music & love the German Christmas event every year :) There is private event space (2 rooms, which can join together) but it's not huge.   Best tip about this place: they also have an additional bar area outside, so you don't have to go indoors to get a drink."}
{"text":"The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery's Weihnachtsmarkt is back! Weihnachtsmarkt is their version of a traditional, German-inspired \"Christmas Market\" with more than 40 open-air booths selling gifts and baked goods from local vendors. It's fantastic! It was the first time my wife and I have been there and it certainly won't be the last."}
{"text":"Great brewery, with abundant outdoor seating. Dogs and kids are everywhere. Decent brews, a few wine options, and a lack of cocktails."}
{"text":"One word for this place - massive. Another word - fantastic. We dropped by on a road trip from Charleston, and ended up here based solely on name recognition, despite the ridiculous number of other breweries in the area. I'd had their Copper years ago at a restaurant, so I had a good impression. Coming from a place where breweries are usually 100 seat affairs and sometimes next to shipping containers and industrial zones, this was an awesome experience.   The walk from the parking lot alone is an experience. Greeted by enormous grain hoppers and fermenters, you round the corner to a truly ludicrous number of outdoor picnic tables. One of the servers told me they had enough seats for 2,000 people outside. Two THOUSAND?? At a Brewery?? I understand this may be the norm for the locals, but I'm a small town guy, so let me be amazed okay? The outside is only the beginning, as you walk into a cavern of a building with long communal tables and an immaculate and attractive bar backed by rows of glassware.   Anyway, we got a couple beers and a couple brats. Quick summary - I really liked every beer (with the Weiss being my least favorite and the Hefeweizen coming in first). Food was delicious, from spaetzle to saurkraut, and less expensive than what I'm used to in Charleston. Staff was attentive and ever-present (in a good way), and honestly OMB is everything a German style beer hall should aspire to be. I was awed, I was impressed, and if this represents the best of what Charlotte has to offer in the Brewery space, I'm in."}
{"text":"Charlotte's most popular brewery. I came to Olde Meck when it was still in its first building and it was always packed. Now it's bursting at the seams at its current place. The beers are always fresh and delicious, and the food accompanies the beers wonderfully. The outside biergarten is fantastic. Whether you're in Charlotte for just a few days or a few years, Olde Meck will deliver. The Copper, Hornet's Nest Hefeweizen and the Mecktoberfest are my all time favorites."}
{"text":"We always make this a stop when in the area GREAT BEER GERMAN style. The best German food anywhere. And the staff was better than the food the beer combined!"}
{"text":"Since we visited Munich last year for Oktoberfest we had to stop in. This place is darn close to bier gardens over there.   It's huge. Let's just start there. We were put off at first at the amount of children running around. The last thing we love to do is sit around with screaming and crying children. I mean, we know you love your kids and you think they are cute but no one thinks they are as cute as you do. Most kids were fairly well behaved. They were playing in the rocks and busy pushing each other over as they were running around.   This leads me to the dogs. Tons of dogs. All on leashes. All but one well behaved. One was bark bark bark bark barking and the owner would not do anything about it. This is just as annoying as absent parents to their kids.   There is a small food trailer outside serving minimal bites. we did not try anything but their pretzels were huge and they looked fantastic. Inside is their full restaurant with a slightly larger menu. Everything sounded really good. Very large inside. I think they have 3 banquet still rooms probably for rent if you want to have an event there.   Their beer was good. I had wiezen, very good.   We would definitely return. We told my parents about it as they were stationed in Germany. I never give them advice on places to visit so this definitely stands out from the rest.   Stop in, stay for a bit. Enjoy the inside or outside. And have a seat at the tables. Don't be afraid to sit at a table that already has people at it. It's the german way."}
{"text":"The only way to get fresher beer than this in Charlotte is to brew it yourself. From the Copper, to the Mecklenburger to their always changing seasonals, you can't go wrong with any of their beer selections. The ambiance is also great. While you drink your traditionally German brewed beer, you're transported to an old-world-style German pub. The tables are clean, the servers are friendly, and you're never left sitting there with an empty glass."}
{"text":"I've been to OMB a few times now for different events, most recently the Brewer's Ball & Christmas Market. While I'm not a big beer person ( If I was I think I would be in beer heaven ) If I was. It may take you a little while to find this spot, since it's down an odd street in Charlotte. I have to give it to this place and their marketing team for always having interesting and community/ local events.  What a huge selection of beer! You can even keep refilling you own beer jugs, how clever and environmentally friendly! I'll have to spot by during the summer months to catch some live music."}
{"text":"What!?!  I haven't written a review for Olde Meck?  Maybe my review was for their previous location... which is by far leaps and bounds hard to remember where they were at just over a year ago.  They have turned into a well oiled machine and pumping out craft brews - also representing Charlotte (in a good way).  Their new space (just down the street from their old diggs) is amazing, with private rooms for parties and events, full service kitchen.  Their food is darn good.  I usually go for the butcher block pizza - which is amazing if you are a carnivore.  I know a lot of the other Charlotte breweries have their special batches and are a little more adventurous with their brews, but Olde Meck is a good constant and pretty much set the bar for craft brewing in the area.  Great bar space... long communal tables and a great outdoor space as well.  There's yoga done on the lawn (forget which day).. but they've also mobilized their kitchen in the form of a food truck so you don't even have to go inside -  The truck has limited items, but at least its out there.  Parking lot in the back of the building is gravel and not your straight forward slab of asphalt.  They kept the trees in the lot so your car has some shade.  Who wants to get in a hot car after visiting a great place and having fun?"}
{"text":"This is OMB's new location. Many of the locals know they used to be down the street where Sugar Creek Brewery is now but they expanded to this ginormous space.  The taproom is huge and they have side rooms they open for private events or overflow crowds. And then there's a huge biergarten/patio with it's own taps and tables galore, some shade and some not.  OMB brews German style beer and they are strict with their recipes and do not stray from German standards. Many people love German beer but I am not one of them.  I can usually find a beer that is OK but most of the beer here does not agree with me. The Anniversary Alt was decent though.  They have a restaurant as well but I have never tried the food.  One big problem I have is there is no seating at the bar. I usually head to breweries on my own and I hate taking up a table just for myself.  But oh well.  The staff was helpful at least."}
{"text":"Went  on Friday night. 5 minutes at least at the bar to flag down a bartender. Once at a table at least 15 + minutes to flag down a server who told us food would be 1 hour. I left immediately. Went to Macs & got served in minutes. I took a date there & felt like an idiot. Never again!"}
{"text":"Love OMB! During the spring, summer, and fall this place is great because of their open courtyard. Plenty of space and great for relaxing with friends during the day. It's a little deep into Southend but well worth it."}
{"text":"Huge place. Insufficient parking. Good beer. Food from a truck. Meh."}
{"text":"Headed here again on Sunday around 2pm.  The weather wasn't great - a little chilly and rainy, but the place was almost empty.  It's probably the first time that I didn't need to fight/rush to get a seat inside - there was plenty of room.  The four of us had a beer and had lunch.  They recently changed the menu, but I was still able to get currywurst as one of my brat choices and spaetzle as a side (spaetzle is no longer even listed on the menu anymore).    The service was pretty slow - had to wait 10 min or so after getting our beers to order.  Then, we could have probably gotten another round, but our server was MIA.  No biggie though.  Food was good and the side portions were huge.  None of us finished our food and we all left full and happy.  Perfect pregame for an afternoon nap."}
{"text":"OMG this place is AMAZING! I'm tagging along with my husband for a business trip and I dragged him here after seeing Yelp reviews & our bartender at the a Embassy Suites recommendation. This place has amazing beir, food, customer service & atmosphere! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for team building events and once for a lazy Saturday... ALL times were worth it. I was finally able to go on a tour of the brewery and enjoyed every minute. The tour guide was super informative and made sure to inform us when we were in \"selfie-safe\" areas.   The wings are always a good choice if you're just chilling out in the back patio! But if you're like me... Then you cannot come here without getting your hands on one of their pretzels."}
{"text":"I like light beers so the wheat beer they had was hitting the spot!  I tried the others and the wheat was the best for me (i am not a beer guy)  Appetizers-  the suasage plate... could had done without for 15 buckets i would get it again for the price  Sandwhich- the rubben and the Italian but really good! Witha side of those lovely potatoes!  Omg"}
{"text":"Best Charlotte Beer!  My favorites are Mecktoberfest and Copper.  Food is always delicious, pretzels, würste, and sauerkraut!  Service is very attentive and the location is nice and open as a typical German style brauhaus. Large outdoor biergarten with plenty of tables and umbrellas."}
