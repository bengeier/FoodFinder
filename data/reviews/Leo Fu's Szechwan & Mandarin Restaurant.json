{"text":"What can I say, for many, many years Leo Fu's was one of our go to restaurants for Hot and Sour Soup & Mooshi (sp?) pancakes! After tonight's take-out we will not be going back. Very disappointed! My advice to the new owners is to do something about this before you have no customers...good luck!"}
{"text":"When I want Chinese (and don't feel like cooking it myself), Leo Fu's is my stand-by, go-to response. Always good. Always friendly. From the soups to the specials, Leo Fu's please the grown-up and kids. Make sure you start your visit with their special wings - you won't forget 'em!"}
{"text":"Leo Fu's has been the go-to Chinese restaurant for my family for years. Maybe because my parents have always lived close by? It has become a fun Christmas Eve tradition. 

It's been very consistent for the last 15+ years I can remember coming. Fast and to-the-point servers, large menu. My favourites include general tso's chicken, chicken wings, dumplings, ginger beef, and vegetable thin noodles. Of course it is not \"real\" Chinese food; but this kind of westernized Chinese food has almost become it's own food category? Enjoyed by many and criticized by a few :)"}
{"text":"We have been going there since it opened - always awesome. We even booked the banquet room as it was a 5/5 place. The change of ownership has tanked everything except for a couple good staff members who are still there. It is below average in all regards now. Too bad!"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy eating here but I don't know what's happened.  I believe there's been a change in management or ownership or something.  But it's not the same.  I miss the staff and the food the last time we ate there was just not good.  I don't know if they burned the ginger beef or what, but there was a real awful after taste to it.  It's sad as it was such a Calgary institution."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch buffet, pretty standard chinese lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Use to be so good . Terrible the last 3 times. Tonight got home they forgot the one big item. Not even an apology for 3o minute drive to go get it. Re heated. ..not fresh. Rubbery chicken. Terrible food. WHAT HAPPENED????the same this year. New owner's?  Ugggggg. No thanks."}
{"text":"This was our second time here since the change in management. 

Gone are the photos of a youthful Ralph Klein and other famous visitors. Unfortunately, the great food is also gone...

The five dish meal that we had was uninspiring. The ginger beef was tough and bland and the rest of the meal tasted like it was re-heated from the previous day. 

The service was very good. The staff were attentive and friendly. 

We used to love coming here. I am not sure that we will be back though."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and they had an uninspiring (for me) buffet of \"Cdn\" style chinese dishes, chicken fried rice, hot and sour soup, noodles, etc. Seemed to be quite popular with the other guests and all you can eat so I was pleased to see I was one of the \"smaller\" diners. (oops is that politically incorrect? I mean they were taller than me)

I had the guilan with garlic and oyster sauce and beef in black bean. Both were good. Service abrupt but fast and effective, no chit chat here. Prices on the high side and I have had better downtown or on Centre St. North but this was good for the South side."}
{"text":"Average!

My Grandparents love this place - they have been going here for years, or possibly decades, and it is the same owners.

Good food, small restaurant, good service.

I like silver dragon better - that is why only 3 stars.

Dumplings are ok, ginger beef is ok, nothing really stands out as amazing...maybe the fact that it hasn't been renovated in quite a while?"}
{"text":"After getting slow service and mediocre food, we tipped $24 on a $216 bill. The hostess informed us this was \"not enough\" and browbeat my 20-year-old niece into giving her another $10. Only come here if you want to pay top dollar for so-so food, and be expected to tip generously for the privilege of giving these sociopaths your money."}
{"text":"Had a group of 7 right after they opened. Food came in good time, was hot and tasty. Waitress really impressed us with her knowledge of the menu. She was very attentive and confirmed several times on the MSG allergy we expressed. Overall, a good night out."}
{"text":"Rather eat at a food court

Paid $26 for General Tao chicken and chicken dried rice and it was not even close to decent. I don't eat unhealthy often but when I do I want to enjoy it and only thing that enjoyed this meal was the trash. 


Maybe next time I will just cook it myself."}
{"text":"Leo Fu's is a Calgary standard, or so I'm told. My beloved's family has been coming here for 30 odd years, and has never been disappointed. The food leans toward Canadianized old-school \"dinner-for-4\" style cooking - and that's fine by me. If that's what they've always done, they've certainly gotten good at it. Authenticity is such a fleeting thing anyway. Who's to say that a few decades of tradition isn't \"authentic\" by now?

To cut to the chase - I like it. The ginger beef, a Calgary specialty, is as good as I've had anywhere. The decor is old school too, like every slightly-upscale \"Chinese\" restaurant looked like a few decades ago - but very clean and well-preserved, having received a fresh coat of paint regularly. I'm not saying it's going to impress a date, but it's a comfortable place to sit.

To sum up - \"traditional\" Canadian/Chinese food, done very well, at reasonable prices. It's not a gourmet experience - it's just good comfort food. What's not to love about that?"}
