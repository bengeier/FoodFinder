{"text":"We checked out this new venue for a second time during their \"Grand Opening Weekend\" and it was EPIC!  Carlos Jones Free Show, what more do you need to say?  Sound System is amazing and the light show was even better!  $5 Hornitos Shots were a bonus and the Beer selection was solid.  I cant wait to check this place out again!"}
{"text":"Great venue. Location was choice, almost no bad spot in the place. There's a lot of neat looking restaurants and bars nearby too. Very walkable area. If you see the food stand selling gyros nearby, DONT get the philly cheese steak. Parking at meters free after 6pm and on weekends- don't let the signs fool you!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night and it was awesome!! They had a series of sweet jam bands playing and the bar was huge. It reminded me of the grog shop but cleaner and 10x bigger. Drinks were on point - I stuck with liquor and my vodka soda was $9 but it's like that everywhere in the east bank bars so I'm used to it.

Will definitely be back here to watch live music and get my dance on."}
{"text":"Intimate place to see a concert. Kandace Springs was a terrific surprise. Happened to see her, and the venue on FB. 
   It was not even close to sold out. However, after concert started, some folks were peeking in through glass door. That means there is some excitement stirred by the venue. 
   I wondered why there was not an easel at the entry way between Crop Rocks and On-Air. It could contain entertainers face, showtime, and price. A few interested people opened door and talked to box office person. 
   Maybe one of the 3 young ladies who were inside at BO, could be seated in the entry way next to easel. That person could answer questions, and maybe encourage some to go inside to see the show. 
   It seems unfortunate that her talent and the cool venue were not better promoted. I keep up on what's happening in CLE, and to be honest, I only heard about the Sunday Reggae. 
     Maybe more promotion is needed. 
      It's a great spot, with lots going on, we all should know as much as possible about it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new place in CLE to get your dance/drink on that's not sleazy and super crowded, check out On Air Studio on the East Bank of The Flats. Some friends and I went for my birthday this past Saturday and its hidden gem status was really refreshing. Think the antithesis of W. 6th in the best possible way.  

Location: Positioned directly next to Crop Rocks, it's the oddball venue/non-restaurant capping off the stretch of waterfront businesses including Alley Cat, Crop Sticks, and the future Costal Tacos. I was super surprised that the boardwalk wasn't crawling with people on a 50 degree night in late January, but it is sort of around the corner/off the beaten path from current social hubs Big Bang Piano Bar, Beerhead, and Punch Bowl Social. 

Overview: It was very clear that the place is still relatively unknown. Like a speakeasy, it's existence can easily be overlooked if you don't know it's already there. Friends trying to meet up with us texted: \"Idk where I'm going,\" and \"I think I'm here???\" We all felt a little lost before, during, and after walking in, but it's definitely worth checking out. 

We had a blast bustin' a move to nostalgia jams, throwback hits, and current crowd-pleasers spun by 107.9's DJ Knyce with only about 25 other people tops. And it was neither college, douche-y, hipster, or geezer city. I can't speak on drink prices because mine were all bought for me (SCORE), but the bartenders were friendly and the wait time was nonexistent. 

Pros: No cover. No wait time for drinks. Big space. Great music. Dancing encouraged.

Cons: Not a lot of people there, which ended up being kind of awesome. 

Bottom line: Capitalize on this place being off the grid. It won't last forever."}
