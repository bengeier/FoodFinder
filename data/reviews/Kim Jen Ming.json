{"text":"This branch is actually a joint site between Kim Jen Ming and Cantine Satay Brothers at the Glen super hospital.   My review is for Satay Brothers:  This was a quick pick-up stop for a non-fast food meal. This place is nothing like the original Satay Brothers site on Notre-Dame (that is magnificent).  The menu has a variety of simple selections, and a sampling menu you can have for a 15$ combo (including tax-comes with a beef, veg or pork curry with rice, a soup and a drink). The food was served warm- My main course was a pork curry that was really spicy- but balanced out with basmati rice. The soup was a little bland with dumplings, the lemonade was super refreshing.  Not up to my original Satay brothers standards but no complaints for  food in a hospital cantine :D"}
{"text":"Finally some great food at the RVH Glen site. They have noodles, pork, rice curry and more. It's a great new spot.  Speak to Frederick one of the co owners and he will give you great service!"}
{"text":"Great spot for flavourful food if you routinely eat at the MUHC. The cafeteria is right beside it, but honestly you wouldn't be able to stand the bland food all the time, albeit cheaper. Had both their chicken adobo and vermicelli on separate occasions. The peanut sauce on the vermicelli was amazing, but overpowering so the whole dish tasted all the same. The adobo also tasted pretty uniform throughout. Still delicious though.   The owner let me try a variety of items before I chose what to get, he was super friendly! They also have interesting desserts like pandan cake and other snacks. It's much pricier than the meals at the cafeteria, so I guess I'd only come here as a treat."}
{"text":"Great asian cantine! If you're looking for flavorful food at the RVH, this is for you! They offer many different options ranging from curries to poke bowls. I've tried different dishes and found them tasty but not too filling. The tapioca coconut pudding is perfect!  Overall, great food but slightly overpriced for the portion size."}
