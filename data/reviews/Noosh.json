{"text":"Great place! I took my wife and daughter there last night, and we very much enjoyed our meals. I had the duck leg special...grilled and served with rice and spinach salad dressed with tahine. The chutney on the side was the best I've ever tasted. Just when you think Madison has run out of great restaurants to try, up pops this one! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Superb food from a small kitchen New Park St restaurant where the old Taco Bell used to be. The home made food is delicious served by Layla herself the goddess of the kitchen. Items are family heirlooms delicately spiced and served in hearty helpings. I had the Shakshuka a tomato based entree topped with poached eggs and a gorgeous hunk of challah bread. My wife asked for a recommendation and was given a spicy, flavorful lamb stew over rice. The place is quaint and still being fixed up with oddball items decorating the open dining space. A  wonderful relaxed dining experience. Much recommended."}
{"text":"I could not believe how tender and flavorful the lamb was on my malawacha, the cucumber tomato dressing had a perfect balance of freshness and acidity that added so much to the flatbread. And that bread, which is an yemeni pancake, was very crisp and crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. I cannot wait to go back and try their dumplings! And I especially liked their Fisher-Price cash register!!! Had a separate beautiful little area for the children"}
{"text":"Not sure how long Noosh has been on Regent St.  I have probably driven by a lot.  And honestly I NEVER would have stopped on my own.  I was supposed to meet my friend there.  I sat in the car for about 10 minutes because I really didn't think this could be the restaurant.  And I really didn't think that my friend could eat there as the building is one of those old metal things and I couldn't see a name on it anywhere.  Granted it was dark.  Maybe it is there somewhere.   My daughter begged not to go in.  But we were in the mood for a little adventure so in we went.    Inside was a bit better.  The owner/cook/waitstaff was very friendly and took great pains to create a pleasant environment.  We were told to sit anywhere.  Since there are only about 4 spots and 2 of them were taken we settled ourselves in as far from the door as we could get.  I do recommend dressing warm in winter.  I had to leave on my coat as I was freezing already.  Others seemed to be comfortable enough without coats.   If you loved Sofia's you should feel right at home here.  It has a lot of that same charm.  When an ingredient is gone.  Well, it is just gone.  It must have been a pretty busy night because many of the dishes were out.  It is a small menu.  So, we made our choices from the remaining options.  I wish I could remember the names of the dishes.  All I can say is WOW!  All of the food was absolutely delicious!  Being a vegetarian I get so used to feeling like a second class citizen!  Well that was not the case here.  Of the dishes most were veg.  And there were all unique!  I REALLY get sick of the same old mushroom sandwich or veggie burger.  As veggies we often just get thrown a bone (so to speak) with out any real love.  There was even one place that had a GREAT veggie pot pie but got rid of it and kept the chicken and beef pot pies even thought they sold out all of the time!!!  Someone needs a vegetarian pot pie.  Gerr.  Anyway......each of the dishes came with a slaw of sorts.  I have a thing against coleslaw.  (I grew up next to a cabbage processing plant, enough said)  But this slaw was WONDERFUL.  I was trying to figure out the unique flavor.  I think maybe a little sesame oil?  SO GOOD.  And the sandwich type flaky pastry things that we had were FABULOUS!  Mine had a cauliflower filling and my daughter had a spicy cilantro, hard boiled egg, tomato filling and our friend had an eggplant filling.  Let me repeat!!!  YUM!!!    My friend also had the lentil soup which she said was great.  The only reason that I am giving only 4 stars is because we had to order more food to feel full.  Which was a great excuse to get the Porgies. Num Num!!  I just wish there had been a option to maybe get a larger portion for a bit more money.  I loved the food and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Quirky little hole-in-the wall place that is exactly what it attempts to be. Small menu but also had vegetarian options. Friendly staff and great funky atmosphere- reminded me of the small restaurants packed full of hippie travelers in India. The \"Desert Wanderer\" (rice and chickpeas and veggies) was tasty and spot-on spicing."}
{"text":"Hipsters will enjoy the background music playing on vinyl. Everyone else will enjoy the awesome food. There are only three things on the menu, I tried two of them and they were both great. I can't remember the name of my favorite but it had pomegranate braised lamb, cucumber sauce, crispy onions and a flaky pita-like bread. It was amazing and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is still under construction, but I went to a soft opening because it is right by my work. I got a Kosher BLT made with smb bacon and it was amazing. Very high quality food, and reasonable prices. I can't wait for the hard open! Oh, and they have freaking drive through!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place, I think a sister restaurant to Layla's on the square.  As others have said, the dining room/décor are in process but the food is ready to go!  I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and rice with salad, great seasoning on the chicken.  The kale & cheese borekas were stellar too.  Overall solid prices for super tasty food, and friendly service.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is going to be at the top of my favorite food places in Madison. It's like nowhere else! We got the shakshuka with tomatoes and artichokes and the malawach with brie and honey. Really good and unique food, and a very friendly owner.  The place is very hipster and can get a little loud. Looking forward to the patio in the back for the summer.   I have mixed feelings of hopes and terror that crowds will discover it (who does not need better food than union south near campus?), but it deserves to stay open forever - I hope I am helping a little with this review."}
{"text":"They have a very limited menu, and everything was cold when it reached our table. The rice was clearly taken out from the refrigerator as it was chunky and cold. The malawach is tasty but it is just frozen paratha. Overall, the food is disappointing and the price is way too high. Do yourself a favor and go for better options next door."}
{"text":"New location for Noosh https://www.yelp.com/biz/noosh-madison  Cozy little space with spinning records and a kids' play table in a Quonset hut. Seriously.  It's great! Had an eggplant malawach their today. I didn't know what that was till today (fried eggplant, with chutney, cheese and a fried egg on a tasty crisped pita). I'd like it bigger and spicier, but still really good. Probably next time I'll get a cup of soup too."}
{"text":"Exquisite Sephardic Jewish cuisine served with love. I started my lunch with a tasty bean soup and when I inquired about some hot sauce they brought out three piquant delights. One was a fig persimmon sauce, one a jalapeño, cilantro, and basil pesto like paste, and the last was chile paste.   The lamb brisket sandwich was THE BEST sandwich I have had in years and probably the best in Madison! It was heaping with tender, slow cooked lamb chunks and topped with a crunchy slaw. The side spinach salad was perfectly dressed with a savory tahini garlic dressing.  Great find, I will back and have been getting the word out. Welcoming staff made me feel like I was being served by family and you'll love Layla's bubbling personality.  I loved it so much I had to purchase their first gift certificate for a colleague of mine so she could have the opportunity to savor this deliciousness. Come here..."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with middle eastern food. My wife, kids and mother in law went here two weekends ago, and m wife and I had the malawach lamb. It was amazing! The lamb was so good that I didn't even want to eat it because it would be all gone. I loved the pastry it was on, not soft or undercooked, perfectly crispy that went well with the lamb. The atmosphere is cool and had a record player that you could play whatever vinyl they had laying around. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"New place, not much on menu but that help reduce the decision making. It was good and would probably stop in again. Make sure to peruse the record collection!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly, efficient service. The lamb is so awesome! the Desert Wanderer (rice, garbanzo beans, onions, sundried tomatoes, and goat cheese) was tasty and portion was generous. Creme Brulee was excellent. Prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food. Will definitely be back to try other options."}
{"text":"Hey all...this is a great little place with an eclectic and quite neat atmosphere. If you thought good food couldn't come out of an unassuming Quonset hut, you'd be wrong! The menu is indeed small, but that made it much easier to choose -- we tried both the pierogi and hummus plate as appetizers, and then one each of \"things on rice\" (chicken) and a Malawach (lamb, in this case). All were very good and flavorful, and the little space started to fill as we were leaving a bit before 7 on a weeknight. There is a kids' table and play area as well for those with little ones in tow. A nice addition to Regent, and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"My favorite item here was the malawach that we got! The flatbread was flaky & the lamb sausage was great as well. The pelmeni paled in comparison as it wasn't as flavorful as the malawach."}
