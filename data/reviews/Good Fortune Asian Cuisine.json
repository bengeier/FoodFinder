{"text":"Food is usually hit n miss. The lady that takes orders n answers the phone is rude!!!! Don't order delivery bc they promise an hour wait but you usually end up waiting at least 2hrs before your food shows up.  And if you call and question why you are still waiting for your food, the lady gets mad n says, \"We are busy! You want to cancel your food?\" n then hangs up on you.  If they are \"so\" busy, why can't they just call and let you know your food will be late?!  I have had it with this place.  Cold food, stale rice, rude service. Not worth the money or hassle anymore. They don't listen or pay attention to the special comments section when you order online.  They don't care or cater to food allergies. The health dept should take a visit to this place.  They would probably be shut down. DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"Don't ever order food for delivery from this restaurant. I placed an order that took 2 and a half hours to arrive. I called three times and each time they had told me that the order was on its way. The final time that I had called, I got hung up on. Horrible customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't post reviews, however after my experience, I felt obligated to share my thoughts.  

This place is terrible - don't go!!! 
What horrible service and dinner.  Everything I ordered sucked (and that's putting it nicely).  The shrimp egg roll was filled with cabbage and one mini shrimp (including tail).  The General's Tso's Chicken was hard as a rock and didn't appear to have any chicken in it.  The Egg Foo Young had very little batter, was tasteless and was filled with too many onions.  

Needless to say, it would be your good forturne to never go here."}
{"text":"I ordered egg rolls, beef and mushroom, shrimp and broccoli, fried dumplings, white and fried rice. The egg rolls are not greasy, beef was slightly gelatinous but good flavor, shrimp are large and yummy, broccoli cooked perfectly, dumplings were better than average and the rice exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Used to be a great little place to get some Chinese delivery. This place has gone to the toilet. Starts with the customer service. They scream and yell on the phone when you call to let them know they sent the wrong order. When they finally agreed to correct the order they wanted the crab Rangoon back that I did not order. Why so you can serve it to another customer (It was only cream cheese and no crab)? When the driver brought me the missing order they burned the chicken so bad is was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"First and foremost let's be clear here. This restaurant  isn't best for dine in. It's a carryout or delivery Chinese place... of which we have many here in the Mentor/Painesville area. If you are familiar, you know that while there are 2 total tables, they're there for waiting... not eating in. Having eaten at all of them, Good Fortune is my favorite. Their prices are the same or lower than others in the area and their selection is great. You could almost say their selection one-ups some of thr other places (Golden Crown and Hop Hing for example) as they offer some Thai and other dishes not found elsewhere. Try the beef Chow Mei Fun for example.

Again, keeping in mind the style of restaurant were talking about, I generally order Chow Mei Fun, large Chicken Chow Mein, and a large Won Ton to feed my hubby and I. My total is generally less than $20 even for delivery, which is ALWAYS prompt unlike DeliverMeFood.com. If I pick up, the woman behind the counter is always friendly and on time. And their location is easy for me to get in and out of fast when I go, usually around 7pm.

The flavors are great. I know a lot of it is generic, but they make it fast and consistent and cheaply."}
{"text":"Look, if you're looking for good, not too greasy, american chinese food, look no further than this no frills take out place. The staff was friendly and patient and had our food out quickly. Not 100% sure what the issue was for the reviewer below but a cursory read after experiencing this place myself makes me think the issue was with the reviewer more than this restaurant. 

fresh food, flavorful, cheap, and fast. Oh! and they deliver. what more could you ask for out of neighborhood Chinese place?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend orders delivery from here occasionally. He's ok with really average American Chinese food. I'm a little more picky but decided to give it a try. Got to the restaurant and was immediately displeased with the shabby interior and dim lighting in the kitchen. I didn't want to judge a book by its cover so went ahead and ordered- worst mistake ever. The girl who took my order couldn't understand a lick of English and was extremely arrogant. For lack of better words she was a rude b**** and shouldn't be allowed to be a hostess. She seemed to hate her life and didn't appreciate my business. Never going here again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worse Chinese food we have ever had.  Paid $1 extra for white meat.  We received breaded fat that tasted like chewy sponge.   Orange chicken looked florescent orange.  Ewes. Beware!"}
{"text":"Got food delivered.  Boneless spareribs dried out.  Did not like egg roll, hardly any veggies in veggie lo mein, mushu pork had weird black mushrooms, asked for fried rice got white, they don't speak English.  Don't like eggroll batter, will never go back!"}
{"text":"The woman who answers the phone rushes you and is so rude. The food is horrible and always missing something. They get my business only because they are the only ones that deliver in my area."}
{"text":"My family had some carry out from Good Fortune last night and it was great.  They have all the typical \"Chinese restaurant\" standbys, which they do really well, but they have more than a Chinese menu.  It's good fortune ASIAN cuisine, with Asian being the key work.  They have dishes from a number of different regions.  Check them out.  Everything was delish, and seemed very fresh.  Even simple things like the crab rangoon seemed fresh made, and not just dropped out of the freezer into a fryer."}
{"text":"Update:

They're hit or miss. Sometimes they're amazing, sometimes they're OK, and one time they were horrid."}
{"text":"Good news: they deliver, they have good lunch prces.

Unfortunately: food quality varies greatly from one order to the next. Beverages have been expired and delivery wait times on the weekends can be almost two hours 

If you can leave the house go to Jade if you can't take your chances here"}
{"text":"Came by late on a weeknight and they were open past 9 (shocking for mentor!) got vegetable lo mein and the boneless BBQ ribs. The boneless BBQ ribs had great flavor but we're a little bit dry. The lo mein though is where it's at! Veggie packed! Amazing flavor! This is my new take out place!"}
{"text":"These motherfuckers waited an HOUR after ordering to cancel. Are you shitting me?? Seriously? How unprofessional. No wonder your place had two and a half stars before I wrote this glowing review of your fine establishment..."}
{"text":"i should have had a heads up the min i saw that there were no reviews from 2011.   I happen to work in the same strip mall where the restaurant is located. I got  carry out  . least to say  when i asked for \"what is good to eat \"   I got a blank stare .  Never the less i ordered some spicy beef with fried rice.  I think in words better said than Chef Robert Irvine \" They Lack Passion\" . I think  this was of humble beginning with a mom and pop operation which went south. All i have to say is when i had to add 4 packets of so-ya sauce to my rice and  dig my meal out of mounds of onions. The food had lost its desire to be eaten.  I hope they improve but till then i will steer clear of there Chinese culinary undertakings"}
{"text":"This if the first time I've had chinese take out while living in Willoughby. I was ordering for 4 people - the lady at the register was very patient and polite taking my order. I was a little concerned after reading the negative reviews that are posted below, but took a chance. I did not order online - I would highly recommend ordering online as we had to wait about 25-30 minutes in the store. Not a big deal as it was my first time. The food was incredibly good, made fresh. Me and the three I was with were all impressed with the quality, and will definitely come back. 

TL;DR - Don't pay attention to the negative reviews about the people working there - it is a solid Chinese joint for fresh satisfying take out."}
{"text":"We moved to Mentor/Willoughby area about 18 months ago and that's where our search for great Chinese take out began. 

After literally trying 6-7 different places and being disappointed by all of them we thought \"well I guess there are no good Chinese take out places around here\". 

Then one day while driving on Mentor Ave we saw Good Fortune and gave it a try. We are really glad we did!! The food is very good, it's full of flavor and taste fresh. Most of the other places we tried were just flat out bland. The soups tasted like hot water but not here. We go to good fortune now twice a week and the food never disappoints. Great find!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese takeout I've had, probably anywhere. This is not a \"sit down\" restaurant, but if you want to pick something up on the way home, or you're just craving Chinese takeout, definitely give it a shot!"}
