{"text":"Wish I could say that the current owners didn't change what made this spot the best place in town for great comfort food with great prices. I'm sorry to say that the quality of food is lacking which is evident by their lack of business. I really miss Kuhar's."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem in Cleveland Ethnic Eats, 2008 edition. It's so tiny that you won't notice it if you blink. Upon entering, it feels like more like a kitchen and the people behind the counter offer a startled hello in accented English. It's carryout only and they have been operating for the past 13 years. The name on the outside reads Kulinar. I love the idea of not having to agonize over a huge menu, you can stick to the daily specials that changes every week. I ordered the Veal Schnitzel for gramma and it was a large enough portion for three people, I don't eat veal but it smelled heavenly, cooked in a caramelized onion, mushroom and wine sauce. It came with a side of beans and mashed potatos and gravy. The box must have weighed 3 lbs and I paid 8.50. I can't wait to go back and order the Chicken Piccata."}
{"text":"Decent food for carryout.  Right by work.  They have daily specials but order early as they run out of stuff a lot and dont tell ya..just replace it (with something else) and hoping ya wont notice..lol.  I like an old school eastern European joint like this.  Some of the ladies workin there are easy on the eyes too....hot pierogi lovin.."}
