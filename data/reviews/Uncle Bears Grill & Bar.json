{"text":"I'm torn!!! I've been going back and forth between 2 to 3 stars. Survey says... I'm sticking with 2 stars. 

The ambiance, cute and playful. If you love dogs, you'll appreciate the dog pictures and dog bowls filled with peanuts on the table. Overall experience, I can't say it was great. It was my first time going there (note: it wasn't even busy) and the server was too busy to bring us water, beer, and napkins. The other server brought out our food and drinks. The food wasn't the greatest, McDonald's would have been a better choice. Hopefully, things will be better next time.

The good news is after my dining experience or lack of, I wrote the manager and he was very responsive. He said he will speak to the staff and make sure the food quality improves. Hopefully he will follow through."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the service is always great. Comfortable place to pass some time.   The open air atmosphere is fantastic.  Great variety of food to choose from and it's always good.   A sports bar without your typical \"sports bar food\"."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had really bad experiences both times we have went here. Bad service, slow food times and no mgmt presence. I did like the theme with the dogs and the dogs on patio but everything else was disappointing. 

I know they have some great reviews here but I just didn't have it both times we were there. With the competition in surprise ratcheting up they will have to do much better to get or keep our business"}
{"text":"This place doesn't exactly make sense. Is it a sports bar? If so, what kind of sports bar is pet friendly? As you walk in and notice the peanuts in the dog dish, it's actually a precursor to the quality of the food you receive. It's low quality, microwaveable type food. It's about as appealing as dog food. DO NOT order chicken here. It got me very sick. A family member ordered a meal with chicken here, and also became ill. And nothing ruins your dinner like the sounds of an auto shop next door. I'd recommend just skipping this place and going to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"The food and the service was really good. Best burgers in town. The stuff very was friendly."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Can dine inside at a booth with TV or on the patio w/ your mut! The aju sliders are delish!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 1 star because you have to give it something in order for the review to take!

 My family and I tried this place on Labor day and it was the worst!!! I made mention on their facebook page about the terrible food only for them to delete it!! 

 My prime-rib sandwich was very soggy, so soggy I couldn't even pick it up to eat it because the bread was mush. My 2 year old had chicken strips that were so over cooked she couldn't even bite into it, my 8 year old ordered mac & cheese and I can almost bet it was Kraft mac & cheese! My husband had sliders, if Uncle Bear's specialty is burgers then they have some real work ahead of them because eating cardboard would have been tastier!!!

 Overall the food was anything but spectacular!! I will not eat here again and I would not recommend it to anyone either!!

FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO EAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have been to since moving here in August.  I went to watch the football games on Sunday, and they were so unorganized, it was almost through the first quarter of the game before they had it on a TV.  I also ordered the Prime Rib Sliders, and just before I was going to take a bite, I noticed something white sticking out of the bun.  It was a very long White Dog hair.  The guys at my table told me there was another one in with my fries also.  Needless to say I did not eat the food, and will NEVER go back there again.  I have told several of my friends about this, and they will not be going there either."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place shut down. I went here once and it was awful. Foremost of all, this place advertised itself as \"dog friendly\". So we went here thinking it would be a nice experience with our little chihuahua. Our dog is sweet and friendly with people, I knew he'd pose no problems. We walked though the restaurant (it took 10 seconds max) to the patio. We were sat at a dog bone shaped table with very little chairs. I didn't mind that, but we were set apart from the other patrons so no one would've been bothered. 
Next thing I know a server is chastising the host for taking us through the restaurant. Of course I felt bad for the host and on top of it the server ended being assigned to our table. 
Right away she asked our order and we weren't ready. 
I tried to put our pup on the tiny little chair (which was about 1 foot off the ground) and the manager came up to say we couldn't because of regulations. That's fine but it honestly made no sense; We were outside as it was and the chair was so small, our pup was as high off the ground as a regular sized dog would be. 
And of course the other patrons were segregated enough to not mind. Then when the server came back we still weren't ready(discussing if it was a good idea to eat there) since I already felt unwelcome with the doggy. But my boyfriend ordered a beer and we sat there contemplating if it was worth staying. But of course the server took her time getting the ONE drink put in (probably on purpose) and we sat there for 15 minutes with no beer. So we walked out -Through the patio entrance-you're welcome. 
P.S. And now you're shut down. Hurrah."}
{"text":"I used to live in the east valley, right around the corner from Uncle Bears, which then changed to Tio Oso's and even then I still loved it. We moved to Glendale last year and never really found my replacement for Uncle Bears. Well that was until yesterday as my wife and I were sitting at lunch when she checked her e-mail on her phone and saw that Uncle Bears opened in Surprise...we immediately knew what was for dinner. 

We went last night. As soon as we walked in it felt like home. The peanuts on the floor, the walls were sparse but we plan on bringing a few photos of our pooches to add next time we're there which will probably be next week because well, we love Uncle Bears. The Jalapeño Popper appetizer is a good way to start the evening. They are some of the best poppers I've had. Next was by far the best item on the menu. I cannot stress this enough if you are thinking of going to Uncle Bears and you're not sure what to order I will make things very simple, The Prime Rib Sliders.

Granted I've only eaten at this location once but I've had most of the menu from the other locations. Rib Basket appetizer is a great meal. The Texas Queso fajitas are awesome. The blackened Shrimp Tacos really good. The Carnivore Pizza excellent(even though we get it without ham). The Nachos are tostada style so you get nachos with everything on each chip. The burgers are always good and if you really feel like you want dessert then go for the bears cookie and cream sundae since  ice cream on top of a fresh baked cookie. 

And I didn't mention the beer...They have great beers on tap and I will drink a lot of it. 

West Valley people please be thankful the best bar food in the valley has arrived to our side be happy, be excited, lets keep place open and full all the time. 

I also forgot to mention we brought our 4 month old and she wasn't the only baby in the place. Not only is this a great bar with great food but it's also a great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Lunch there yesterday with Nena Moreno. What a fun doggy-themed bar. Dog-bone shaped bar tables, peanuts in the shell at each table. Yeah, you can throw your shells on the floor. Great food and their steak fajitas are melt in your mouth tender and flavorful. Will definitely be a favorite of mine and will be going back again. So many different types of food. You can bring the doggy with you on Saturdays if you care to drink and dine on the patio. Prices are very reasonable. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar and grill in Surprise! Absolutely love the staff! Food is very good! Love the blackened chicken sliders! Oh and love places that give you peanuts and you throw the shells on the floor. Very nice patio!

Loved this place and was a regular here. Now they suddenly close and give no explanation. They removed themselves from Facebook where they could have posted a reason so regulars like us were not wondering why. Business always seemed good too. Thanks for nothin uncle bears!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times since the 10/29 episode and have received excellent service and good food.  I guess the bad trip was an anomaly.
The nacho plate is great."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with my work.  They were not super crowded, but seemed understaffed.  Our server seemed harried and did not come around much.  We practically had to trip her to get her attention .  Food was ok, I enjoy the turkey melt and their hush puppies are awesome!  Was loud as it got crowded and pretty cramped.  Would go back but not a first choice."}
{"text":"This was not the first time we've been here, we usually have great service and the food is usually great too. However this last time we went we had to walk out! They sat us outside like we asked, then we ended up waiting at least 15 minutes just for our server to take our drink order, which she never did so that's when we walked out. She didn't come running to us until she saw us leaving, too late! There was no excuse for her ignoring us, 3 different groups of people came after us, sat in a different section outside, and their server was on it! Too bad we did not get that server :(

So we left and went down the street to Red Robin, much better service!"}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant. I've been here twice and each time I'm disappointed. This time I had the French onion soup and meatball sliders. The soup was very salty, so much so that I could not get two swallows down. The sliders were okay, nothing over the top or impressive. The meatballs had good.seasoning, but the slider lacked sauce completely. 

The waitstaff are always friendly and accommodating, but slack in customer service after you've been seated. We were promised our check and a to-go box and waited nearly 20 minutes for our waitress to appear again, only to have forgotten both. 

I won't be coming back to Uncle Bears."}
{"text":"my husband and I sat for 30 minutes without being waited on while waitresses and waiters stood around talking to each other. This is the 3rd bad service experience. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night for family dinner and it was just okay...food was overpriced and the service was terrible. I was nice and tipped our server though he didn't deserve it cause he really didn't provide any service other than taking our order and bringing our drinks. This will definitely be the first and last time we go there. We always try to help out local businesses out but it's really hard sometimes...really bummed about this place."}
{"text":"The address listed didn't take me to the restaurant but it was right across the street. We went in during Sunday night football and loved the table with the tv. Busy but service was very good and food was great. We really enjoyed ourselves and I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great service and food the Cajun belly rub burger was nice and spicy and the outdoors fireplace was a great spot for a cigar
Craft beer selection was a bit limited but the specials were a DEAL"}
{"text":"The great thing about Uncle Bear's is tha dogs are the theme and real dogs are allowed!!  The other great thing is that Uncle Bear's supports local dog charities and gives back to the community!!  Yes, the food and the ambience is great, which is very rare for the Surprise restaurant community, so I say 5 woofs all around!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a place that has an extensive food and drink menu, with a lot of TV's, then this is the place!  We just went here last night and it was great!  Milkshakes were thick, lots of beer on tap, and the queso dip was AWEEESSSOMMMEEE!  LOVE this place.  :)"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar atmosphere, plenty of TVs for football season. The foods pretty good but a bit on the expensive side for what you get. Prime rib sliders are great and run around 9 bucks. The blackened chicken salad was over priced and was basically iceberg lettuce with chicken  on top, skip it. Happy hour needs some work as the prices are not at all great and  we weren't very happy about the \"discounts\" for happy hour. Service needs some help."}
{"text":"What can you say about place that encourages throwing food waste on the floor and allows dogs.  The furnishings are a little awkward.  I felt like I was in some warped combination of Petsmart and a children's play center.  Service was good.  I had the prime rib sliders, they were ok but not good enough to risk having a wind come through and put dog hair in my food.  I had their wheat ale-it was pretty decent.  I doubt I would return, but if someone I knew really really wanted to go there I would go."}
{"text":"Again ,let me start by saying I am in the restaurant business. 
Uncle Bears is a cute idea gone wrong. The concept is lost....what is Uncle Bears ? A sports bar, A pet friendly family restaurant?  An offshoot of an often repeated some kind of something with no identity? I am not sure what it is. 
I am sure that the food is HORRIBLE. Just garbage....The taste reflects the quality....HORRENDOUS. Enough said on the food.
Ambience.......HUH ? I along with all 4 of my dining companions were totally confused as to what they were trying to do. In addition, we all thought it was a \"hollow\" feeling in the restaurant. It just doesn't work. It is a cross between several ideas that do not go together at all.
Price point is 3 steps above the quality of food being served. Alot of other reviews state precisely this. The price is an insult to those of us that know better. If you don't know better ...enjoy. But enjoy soon the doors will be closing."}
{"text":"i can't believe this place got any reviews that were not 1 star.  TERRIBLE.  If microwaved food, slow service and  dirty atmosphere is what you are looking for, this is your place.

 They foreshadow their bad food by serving you peanuts in a dog bowl. All of their food should be plated this way.  Honestly, any review above 1 star was probably given by someone who eats canned spaghetti and frozen pizza as their diet staples."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see how packed this place was.  Chuy's was never that crowded, but this place brought a crowd.  Atmosphere is nice, food is tasty, servers are attentive (despite the crowd) and an overall fun vibe for Surprise."}
{"text":"EDIT: After some more thought I think three stars were honestly more than our experience merited.

Uncle Bear's was a bit disappointing; I feel I'm being generous giving it three stars. 

Ambience: They advertise a \"dog motif\" which consists of customer-provided pictures of their dogs and dog food bowls full of peanuts on the table (we thought the bowls were fun). They have TVs hung on the walls playing sports which are nice though I know experts generally consider it taboo to make customers look toward the walls. The paint and furniture appears to be new and clean but there's not much in the way of decoration other than pictures of dogs which, lets' face it, at least have the cute factor.

Service: Our server seemed like she was probably new to the gig and not very well trained in so service was sub-par for us. She was rather slow with requests and just plain forgot about part of an order but by the time she came back around it didn't make sense to ask again. Food came out pretty quickly but the server had to offer many apologies for the service.

Drinks: We had to exchange a drink (arnold palmer) because it tasted awful - worse than a powdered drink mix. The server advised it's Minute Maid lemonade. The beer selection is decent and their version of a black and tan which they call a Guilt Lifter since it's Guinness and Kilt Lifter was poored well.

Food: As I mentioned before every table has a bowl of peanuts in the shell and you can toss the shells on the floor. The menu is fairly large and contains salads, burgers, pizza, tacos, pasta and more with no overall theme consistency. I always find that kind of variety off-putting because in my experience some things are poor quality and just thrown in there to try to appease every customer's taste. Our party had a combination of burgers and fajitas. All were pretty tasty but lacking anything that made them stand out over other restaurants. I wanted to order the teriyaki burger but changed my mind when I asked what the \"pineapple tidbits\" were and was told by the server \"honestly, they're the kind out of a can\" ...yuck. Don't you generally expect a grilled slice of fresh pineapple on a teriyaki burger from a grill house? The steak fries were tasty and weren't greasy. Overall the food was satisfactory but nothing that's going to come to mind at the top of the list when we're trying to decide where to eat - it was forgetable.

Really the only reason they earned the third star for me is by offering an outdoor seating area where customers are welcome to bring their dogs. Even so I doubt we'll go back (we have dogs and like to take them out some times). It's worth a try; some people seem to like it but don't expect much more than a place to fill your belly... while looking at pictures of cute puppies, haha."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Family friendly place with great food. All fresh and all super tasty! Have not had a bad meal yet and the beers are always awesome! I feel very comfortable at this place and have no complaints."}
{"text":"Appetizers are ok but I go for the drink happy hour. Great prices and every server I have had there was friendly and courteous and attentive. I'd go here just for the servers."}
{"text":"Not great BUT not terrible... After a To-Go order that I wasn't extremely impressed with my husband convinced me that the food is usually better than what we had that particular night. So I decided to dine in another time... The service wasn't bad. Our server was pretty chipper and friendly as with the manager who stopped by to check on us. 
However, I was disappointed that the peanuts in the dog bowls were old and stale. I don't recal having to wait an extremely long amount if time for our food and it was definitely better dining in but my husband ordered sweet potatoe fries and didn't receive them with his meal. Our server didn't notice it even after the server made sure we understood it was a $1 up charge. We got the sweet potatoes after we were finished eating. During our meal we started to notice the server really wasn't talking to us but at us and didn't seem to listen to us... It was as if our server wasn't used to anyone interacting and just kept going thru their normal spiel not really acknowledging what we said. 
While I don't think the food is super great it also isn't bad so my husband wanted to get take out and I agreed hesitantly.... When my husband came home he said he couldn't understand why it took do long to get our food. He then tells me that when he placed the order that he orded us both the Ragin' Cagin' Chicken. He then says the girl that took the order asked if he wanted the Chicken or the  sandwich. Confused he says that he thought it was a sandwich because it was in the burger and sandwich section under the burgers...  The sandwich would have been awesome IF my lettuce wasn't wilted from  the hot off the grill chicken and the bottom of the bun wasn't soggy. The fries weren't awful but kinda cold but he did have to drive home.  Overall it's just OK."}
{"text":"We are always looking for some place new to try on the west side of town.  Stopped in on Sunday, 1/12/14 - probably won't be stopping in again.  Waitress never showed up for about 15 min.  They sent the bus girl over with a rag and spray bottle (twice) to see what we wanted.  She tried but had no clue.  We had a coupon and that really confused them.  Ordered a Guiness and sent it back - yuck- watered down or something.  Food was just OK.  Many seats in the place were open - we sat in a quiet corner - then a large family of 6 with very young kids had to be seated right next to us....why?  with so many tables open?

Ladies room was out of TP - Sorry - nothing good to say today."}
{"text":"I went here for one reason, you can bring your pooch to eat with you, that being said they don't accommodate your furry friend that well. First you have to eat with your dog on the patio, second they don't have anywhere to hitch your dog while you eat, and third they have no dishes for the dogs,which I would have gladly paid for. The waiter however was very nice and brought my dog some water and refilled the canines drink whenever he refilled mine. Now onto the food, the wings I ordered were great and I didn't even opt for the after fry grille option. But my burger was sub par sorta dry cheap lettuce and bun and just not all that satisfying the fries were clearly frozen as we're the onion rings. All that being said it looks like it would be a really cool place to have some beers on a Friday night, especially if you wanted to stay on the patio with your four legged friend!"}
{"text":"Oh my!! This place is wonderful! Had breakfast there and the chicken fried steak with sausage gravy is just like what Granny made back in the olden days.  After I woke up from my carb induced coma- I realized they had football on the big screens!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened up in 2012. Service seems to have gotten better, but I still try to avoid this place during football games. Service tends to be a lot slower during game day. However we still love coming here, we always bring our pet here with us. Food is great, and very affordable. But we just heard they will be changing their menu soon! Going more to the menu they have with the Uncle Bear's Brew menu? That means, prices will be going up as well. Hope they don't change to much, would be sad if we would have to look for another pet friendly restaurant. Until then, this is still one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon because you can take the dog and sit outside. 15 minutes from receiving a menu to ordering. 30 minutes to get 2 salads and 2 burgers which were lukewarm. Another 15 minutes just to settle the bill. I don't know if it is lack of staff or ll bad management but a quick bite to eat took over 2 hours. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"5 stars for opening! We have been watching the building change from Chueys to Uncle Bears and were excited to see it open today!! 

Minus 2 stars because it was a small opening. If we didn't drive by, we would have never known. 

Overall it's a great place, great food. Cant even tell what was there before. Try to go in before the rest of the West Side knows they are open. 

2 stars back for the overall experience from entrance, food, service and exit. For a total of 5 stars. Not many places get 5 stars för me.  ;) 

The line was short, the staff was courteous. Which I LOVE! Nothing is worse than a new restrauant and the staff is impatient. Some of us need a little extra time to read the menu.   Excited to have a new place to eat in Surprise. give them a try. :)"}
{"text":"This place had me at \"Woof.\" I'm being \"serial.\" There are dog bone shaped tables topped with dog bowls filled with peanuts with shells that can be discarded with on the floor. If you bring a 8 x 10 black framed photo of your pooch, they will adorn one of their walls with that photo. How cute is that? This is my kind of laid back place!

The patio outside is large and very inviting. There are large cushioned iron furniture covering the patio. One of the corners held a tall fireplace with surrounding couches. I could definitely see this place being good for a happy hour hang out after work.

My co-workers and I came here for one of our lunch breaks. We only had an hour and were short on time. Two of my friends shared a fajita salad. Others ordered the mini pizzas. The mini pizzas looked like those Lean Cuisine microwave pizzas in size and appearance, but they tasted pretty good. I, myself, ordered a sizzling beef fajita platter. It was very similar to the one that you'd get at Chilis. The beef was very tender and not chewy at all. I really enjoyed my meal.

We were all very stressed though, because we got there at 1pm and didn't get our food until 1:40pm, so we basically had to scarf our food down in 10 minutes to give us 10 minutes to drive back to our office. I just didn't understand the wait because the place wasn't crowded much at all. Only 3 or 4 tables at the entire large restaurant seemed to be occupied. 

I still like the setting though, so we will be back. Maybe we just need to make sure we have more time next time though, so we don't have to stress so much. ...Or maybe it's a sign that we should just come for happy hour instead?"}
{"text":"The whole dog theme for a restaurant is bizarre! Peanuts in a dog bowl, dog bone shaped tables, dog related stuff on the walls, but what really killed it for me were the pictures of dogs on the menu. I love dogs, but I don't want to be looking at them  when I'm browsing my menu. The first thing that pops into my head is dog hair, 
dog breathe, and poop....eew!

The servers are SLOW, don't know the menu and specials, and are not the friendliest. The menu is all over the map. My impression was that this is an \"American Grill\", but you can order burgers, sliders, Mexican, pasta, and even pizza too....WTH? The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that they have a cool patio with nice fire pits. So unless you're just looking to have a drink and hang out by the fire, stay away from this place.

I used to frequent the Chuy's that was at this location, and that was fun and yummy! If you want dogs and want to be playful, take it to the dog park, not the restaurant."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sliders are awesome! Decor is a little cheesy with the dog theme, but its fun."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to your Surprise location for a late dinner tonight. We wanted to try out the new place. It was dead as it was a Sunday night and only 1 other table besides us. We were greeted right away and sat quickly and took out drink orders right away which was nice, We decided on your Sunday special of pizza and wings, we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. We were waiting a long time, I made the comment to my daughter that is shouldn't take this long for wings I bet the waitress is waiting on the pizza instead of bringing the wings out when they were done. Sure enough the waitress comes with the wings and a pizza that is covered with all kinds of meat on it. my daughter and I look at each other and then at the waitress and said isn't what we ordered she looks like she has no idea so I have to tell her we ordered the BBQ chicken and she says ooh and looks at us like she expects us to be OK with it. I had to tell her I can't have all that meat it was the carnivore pizza, then she said ooh OK I will get you the BBQ. The waitress still hadn't given us plates they were under the pizza and when she took it back she took the plates with her. My daughter watches her hold the plates back by the kitchen then put them down we wait a while hoping she will bring them to us so we can eat the wings but she goes over and starts talking to other staff, so I have to yell excuse me to her so she will come and we can ask for plates. now I am bugged. when we ordered the wings the waitress said do you want mild or explosive, well I don't want explosive but also not mild but since that is all she offered we did the mild, when they came it looked like no sauce on them at all and that was about how they were, the basket that they came in instead of extra sauce at the bottom was instead alot of grease. My daughter said we could make these better at home. The BBQ pizza finally comes out and we were both so disappointed in it, the crust was bland and dry you could still see flour cooked in it didn't even want to eat the end of the crust also way to much chopped tomato and I think cilantro, I like all this but if I wanted a salad I would have ordered it I only ate 1 piece of the pizza it was so bad. Half way thru we ask the waitress for more water, she brings new cups of water she sits the new waters next to the empty ones, I had my cup at the end of the table for her to take and she walking away with out them and I have to say can you please take the empty cups, Like my daughter said when you looked at her face it was like no one was home. I could under stand this if maybe the place was packed and she was busy but we were her only table! We were very disappointed in the service and the food and we will not be coming back. I don't like wasting my hard earned money on bad food and bad service

A update I sent a email to the manager and they replied and asked me to give them another try so we did and I have to say this time we had great service and we tried salad and sandwiches and they were good, we like it that we will go back again, we just know to knot order the pizza's."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst new places we have tried in the last few weeks! I cannot for the life of me figure out what people are talking about! The food was so substandard I wouldn't actually even feed it to my dog! Paid an arm and a leg for a \"crispy chicken salad piled high with garden goodies\" and got a bowl of bag salad I could buy at the store with mealy tomato and a sprinkle of cheese. WHAT? And, the chicken which cost an extra few dollars, was gross and dry (probably left over from the day before). We also had several other items (french dip,  spaghetti and meatballs) all of which were way overpriced considering they tasted like leftovers and the meat was so low quality. After trying them we found out they have other locations, which means as a new restaurant, these are not mistakes...but the way they do things. IT IS NOT OKAY, IT WAS DISGUSTING,  WE WILL NEVER BE BACK & WE HOPE THEY CLOSE!  People who actually deserve our hard earned money are out there trying much harder to prove they deserve our patronage. THIS PLACE IS NOT ONE OF THEM!  IF YOU ACCEPT POOR QUALITY AND SERVICE AS THE NORM, THAT IS ALL WE WILL EVER GET, DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Our night at Uncle Bear's started out pretty well.  We drove like 25 minutes to get to this location because we were craving the nachos and ice cold beer.  The beer was cold and the nachos were tasty.  We ordered dessert and then everything went downhill.  The cookie was cold and rock hard, and the ice cream was so hard it seemed like it had been in the freezer for months.  My husband and I were talking amongst ourselves and the bartender starting talking with us.  Everything was fine until he started saying things that were quite insulting to both my husband and I.  My husband was so annoyed and angry that he didn't even want to tip the guy.  I did, even though he was very rude and made our experience an unpleasant one.  Note to bartenders: don't piss off the patrons because it makes your wallet a whole lot lighter.  We will not be returning to this location purely because of the unpleasant service."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar.  Nice outdoor patio with a fireplace which I imagine would be great in warmer weather.  It was pretty cold when I went.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Plenty of tv's to watch events.  Food was good.  Nothing memorable but not bad.  I'd go again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this American restaurant! Brought the dog, sat on the patio near an awesome fireplace and had good, albeit unhealthy, food. Ate nachos (really good because each nacho had toppings and was separate from the other chips), wings and a pizza. Wings were meaty and crispy and the pizza had an awesome hand pressed dough. Met other cool people that brought their dogs to eat and started up good conversation. Staff and clients were friendly. Had live music that started about 730 and the singer was really good. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have zero complaints, but at the same time, I have zero praises.  The food is typical American food you can find anywhere.  It doesn't stand out compared to the other establishments in the area.  The most unique thing about Uncle Bears is the name and that just makes Uncle Bears really boring.  If you're not picky about food, and just want a place to sit and relax it works very well.  But other than that, nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"The server bree was great the manager need to give her a raise but great food  clean bathrooms and restauant is clean so I give it a 12 out of 12 and if you go see Bree she is great"}
{"text":"It's simple, something has changed since they have opened.  I went there on the 26th and the hostess was so friendly and that gets a 5 star rating but from there it all goes down hill!  The wait staff is not great, the cook puts food up too soon before the other food is ready making it so the fries come out cold and then you need a do over and the prime rib sliders are shaved now so they can throw the fat in there.  It was so disgusting.  I have to admit I am picky so I took them home to my husband and fellow yelpers HE DID NOT EAT THEM enough said, THIS MAN EATS EVERYTHING!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"The food was blah. We had wings with no flavor. Ribs and pork plate was too sweet and tough. With a dollop of cole slaw. The prime rib sliders were ok. They had to be eaten with the au jus or they would have been totally gross. The waiter was not helpful and slow. We won't be back. Sad"}
{"text":"We were excited to go to a dog friendly place but had no idea that we would have to wait forever for us or our dog to eat. The food was okay. The service was horrible. If I go back I hope I don't get the same waitress. They really need to work on getting better servers, it was ridiculous. If you advertise that you are dog friendly and you have dog food options maybe you want to have that in stock. They didn't have anything and we took our dog their for their birthday. We ended up getting a burger for our dog, crazy!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to hang out.  There is a nice outdoor patio with a fireplace for cool evenings.  Our waiter was friendly and very accommodating when we asked for separate checks for our party of 7."}
{"text":"We took both of our dogs here after a vet appointment and it was pretty awesome.  The service was pretty slow but since we weren't in a hurry it wasn't that big of a deal.  Our waiter Billy was awesome and very knowledgeable about what the restaurant had to offer.  He saved us 15% on our bill!
The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed.  We sat outside (because we had the dogs) and it was very nice, could have used some misters though.  Everyone there customers and staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"Really cool idea for a restaurant, especially for dog-lovers.

The doghouse theme is spread throughout the restaurant, from the chain link \"kennels\" (booths), to the dog food bowl filled with \"treats\" (peanuts), to the tongue-in-cheek names for dishes.

I ordered the fajita salad (probably under a different name) with grilled steak. My grandma ordered a personal pepperoni pizza. The waitresses and hostess were friendly and prompt, something I've come to appreciate over many restaurant visits.

Food critique:
-the steak for my salad came as ordered (medium rare) but was extremely chewy and difficult to digest, a sign of a poor cut of meat. The portion of steak to salad was \"ok\" at best, but it was a very large salad to begin with. 3 stars for the salad.
-my grandma's personal pizza looked pathetic (how's that for alliteration??). It looked like something out of the freezer aisle at Food City. The crust was barely darkened, the cheese looked fake and had that barely-lukewarm-edible appearance to it. I didn't even have to eat it and I knew it didn't taste good; this was later confirmed by Grandma.

Apparently, you are allowed to bring leashed dogs and sit on the patio to eat, they even have special dog-food items you can order for your four-legged friend. The toss-your-peanut-shells-on-the-floor really gave it that laid-back feel but is also very very dangerous for elderly people who have canes or are unsteady on their feet. And as a final note, it seemed like all the female staff members were pregnant. Not something that I really cared about, but how does that happen?

I'll be back with my pup in-tow to try something different (and hopefully better) on the patio."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for pizza and wings so we thought we would try a new place.  I will not return.  We ended up sending back the pizza because it wasn't good.  It had a burnt carbon taste to it even though it wasn't burnt.  The wings were ok.  I wasn't impressed over all. Service was good and so were the drinks."}
{"text":"Servers are attentive and their queso rocks!"}
{"text":"Was really hoping for a better experience. Once we walked in, we noticed there weren't a lot of people for a Saturday afternoon and college football. We liked the idea of a dog theme, and the peanuts in dog bowls. We really were disappointed that our waiter had no idea of what beer was available, which resulted in my having to order a different beer 3 times because it turned out the beer wasn't available. I commented to our waiter that the manager needs to do a better job in having the opening meeting to outline the beer selection so the waitstaff are prepared and don't look like fools to their customers...and the waiter agreed. Never saw the manager making rounds. The chicken wings were just average and I have to say the Thai peanut sauce is too thick and pasty. We drank our one beer each and had a few wings and left. I don't foresee us going back, too bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning. Our waiter Mike was excellent. Very attentive to our needs and brought me refills without asking. The breakfast was excellent. I had the country steak and eggs. The gravy was amazing. Everything tasted fresh. I love that this place is dog friendly on the patio. We bring our two pitbulls here often and the staff take good care of them keeping their water bowls full."}
