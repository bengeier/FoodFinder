{"text":"I can't believe it's gone. SO sad :(   It's tight and small but if you can get in, it's well worth the wait. The service is a bit slow but the food is to die for. I had the Asian  egg dish. It came with Bombay potatoes, ginger, black sesame seeds, killer fresh baked toast and portabello mushrooms. If I was on death row, I would request this as my last meal. Yes, it's that good"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a sandwich on the weekend.   The owners are so very nice and they always have a great lighthearted staff.  The patio is a nice touch, very casual  As a meat eater, I'm skeptical of vegan menus, but the food just tastes great.  The added benefit is how energetic I feel afterword.  If I'm going to do something important I will consider a meal here first.   The best part, however is the charm.  My first time I was there, the owner told me with a wink \"your mother isn't here but I am.  Eat your salad!\""}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ! Huge portions of bombay potatoes, eggs and toast. I sat outside and enjoyed the cute little garden out back.   Minus one star for not 'serving' coffee. It's self-serve, which is fine if you are sitting inside, but I'm not going to interrrupt my conversation to walk through the kitchen to get my own coffee.  Sadly, no espresso-based drinks, either.   The juice was great, though.  The portions are well-priced, meaning you get what you pay for. A $8 sandwich is significantly less food than the $12 omelette with toast and potatoes.   Service can be slow- but it lets you relax."}
{"text":"This is my brand new favourite vegan/vegetarian brunch spot in the city.   The food here has yet to disappoint my guests - whether they're meat eaters, vegetarians, or vegan. The dishes are delicious and they include many options, everything from omelettes to a vegan \"English Breakfast\" to burritos and sandwiches and wraps. The service is friendly and you can typically get in and out of rather quickly but it's NOT lightening fast by any means (they are pretty up front about that in their menu!). I really value meals that include quality, healthy ingredients - everything from amazing whole grain toast with various seeds and organic, free range eggs (for those who eat them).    If you're in the neighbourhood there is no reason NOT to go. And if you're not, it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Tiny and cozy and delicious!  That's how I describe this place. Everything is vegetarian and vegan, or even RAW!!!!  That's rare in Toronto.  The food is all hand made on site by the lovely female owner and her waitresses.  I came here for the brunch right after my 5k race for Pride Parade.  My bib nickname was VEGAN GAY, very gay.  Anyways, the food is good, really good.  I highly recommend the salad, any of them!  I also recommend the omelette with the toast and sauteed potato, some how their toast tastes really good.  Thick and chewy.  Tasty!  My friend also loved the eggs.  She was really impressed on how vegetarian and vegan food can tastes so good.  Yeah, don't forget the cheesecake!  THE AMAZING VEGAN CHEESECAKE (heard me roar?)!   Toronto!  Good job. PS: I think they have mimosa sometimes."}
{"text":"I have to say, I visited Get Real! Cafe this morning for brunch and boy, it sure has come a long way.  The service was prompt and super-friendly.  And above all, the owner seemed to turn over a new leaf, treating the employees with the respect they deserve.  The food even tasted better than I remembered it.  I will be back again and again.  I'm glad I gave it another chance."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Being able to roll out of bed and get an omelette at Get Real is basically the perfect Sunday afternoon. Yes, afternoon. Not only because you might have had a rough Saturday night, but also because the place is TINY and is usually packed for weekend brunch.  It's packed because the food is phenomenal. Even if you're not vegetarian or vegan (and I'm neither), you can definitely appreciate the deliciously seasoned tofu and fresh seasonal vegetables (and gluten-free bread!). They do serve organic eggs and cheese, just in case your brunch isn't the same without it.  And they offer every substitute imaginable.   The place may be tiny but it's got great decor -- from the local art all over the walls, to the cute linen tablecloths; hell, they even put a grape or cucumber slice in your water to make it prettier. The kitchen is open so you can see exactly how delicious food is made, the only downside being your clothes might smell like your breakfast later on. But that can sometimes be a good thing!  If you're a coffee person, they have great coffee-- and you can fill it up over and over again at the coffee counter, and make it even sweeter with soy milk. And if you're lucky enough to work close by, call ahead and get some takeout. I guarantee a burrito on your lunch break will make your day better.  It should be noted that Get Real! is great any time of the week -- not just for brunch -- and it's usually less busy during the week so you won't be  crammed into the corner. Yesterday I was in the corner, but it felt more cozy than crammed, and I think that had more to do with the Mayan omelette that was so good I almost licked my plate clean (I know, gross mental picture) and the freshly squeezed orange juice that was made from the sweetest oranges I've ever tasted. The place was busy, but we were warned in advance that the kitchen was backed up, and the food didn't even take that long!  I think that's enough proof that Get Real! really cares. They care about you putting real healthy, organic food into your body, and they care that you have a great time at the cafe. And that's enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Tiny & cozy with amazing food and knowledgeable staff, but the hours are TERRIBLE. I think it closes at 6 or 7pm during the week, meaning dinner is an impossibility. The only time I've been able to visit has been for brunch - they really should consider improving their hours on weeknights, especially considering that Ossington has become a hotspot for evening activity with all the new restaurant and bars opening recently.   Having said that, brunch was amazing. Believable vegan cheese in a black bean and sweet potato burrito with rice that was super filling. Highly recommended if you're in the area for weekend brunch!"}
