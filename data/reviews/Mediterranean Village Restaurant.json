{"text":"The service at this restaurant is slow.  And for their price they give very small portions and they are very stingy with their portions. I ordered a BBQ chicken plate with rice and my BBQ chicken was cold and my rice was undercooked and hard.  I told them that my chicken was cold and they gave me two chicken kebabs instead, and these were very cold as well. My two friends were also very unhappy with their food. One friend ordered a falafel plate and left more than half of her food because she didn't like it. Another friend had a falafel wrap. She saw that the lady filling the wrap put a single slice of tomato, so she asked for more... She got one more slice. And there was hardly any lettuce in the wrap,even when she asked for more. The staff is unhelpful, and the service was extremely slow. It's a fast food restaurant... But we waited at least 15 minutes for our food. Also, their only single person washroom did not have toilet paper. What kind of restaurant doesn't have extra toilet paper in the washroom, especially when it's a single washroom? I would not recommend this place,  save your money and go somewhere else and enjoy a nice hot meal with good service.   Basically this place is terrible. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Nice place. Love their fries. I've tried their kebab here before and it's pretty good. Tried falafel another time though and it definitely doesn't warrant a reorder anytime soon. They're generous with salad here. The couple who runs this place is patient and friendly. Didn't complain when we asked to place an order as we came in ~15 mins before closing time! Sweet people and nice food in a fantastic location, close to everything in the Square One area."}
{"text":"30mbps free WiFi, and comfortable seating. Food has really improved these past couple months. It's fantastic. By far my favourite study spot in Square One."}
{"text":"I come here relatively often, and although the chicken used for shawarma is sometimes inconsistent in quality, the majority of the time it is decent and the mixed grill plate/anything freshly grilled for you is good and worth a try. The owners are extremely nice and friendly people if you take the time to speak to them and I don't know what everyone else is talking about in terms of asking for extra. They consistently give me extra pickles, turnips, and tahini for no extra charge. I think the issue is those customers that had these issues likely asked for them in a rude manner. You get a lot farther with a little bit of kindness. Keep in mind this is not a regular restaurant, but rather almost a kind of fast food place in which you quickly get your meal (and most often leave with takeout)."}
{"text":"Just below average for a sauga shawarma, even the falafel, much better places in sauga to go, but it is convenient if you're in the square one area and a student of Sheridan."}
{"text":"It's not that bad. It's actually ok. The owner, I assume that was the owner preparing the shawarmas was a bit slow but courteous. I had the beef shawarma, which was ok. I also tried on another occasion the ground beef kebab wrap and it was good. Again, nothing to write home about, but decent."}
{"text":"This place quickly became one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA. I'm addicted and I go at least once a week. I order the Chicken Shawarma plate with fries, it's probably the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life (I'm not exaggerating).   The lady that is always at the front is very warm and friendly and prepares all the meals with extra TLC. Although one thing I must add is that she needs more help up front, if there's more than a few customers in the place the service gets compromised a little bit.  I've tried a few other plates and they are extremely good as well, but that Chicken Shawarma plate is heaven in a dish. Don't sleep on this place. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Came here because it's close to my campus, not sure if the chicken was cooked fully. Only ate a bit of it, I gave the benefit of the doubt that they may have been busy throughout the day, but the floor was messy. Bad quality. People really seemed to like this place, I'm not sure why"}
{"text":"Tried this place when they initially opened. They have great student deals but the food was just sub par. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich which was not very tasty. The chicken might not have been marinated well or at all and the topper ingredients were so so. Might have been an off day for the owners."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, the food took 1 hour and 20 minutes delivery, when I called to check on the status of the food, some young woman was very rude, ignoring and me and laughing in the background. When the food did FINALLY come, the driver stood on my steps arguing with us why their service was good and getting in a heated argument with my sister. Like seriously how dare you talk angrily to my family especially my sister. you're lucky I didn't call the police for your trespassing on my property as this was after we paid and he refuse to leave. I kept trying to get him to leave, telling him we paid right? (to give him a hint) and he still wanted to argue. HORRIBLE I MEAN HORRIBLE PLACE, and the food was cold and subpar, seriously go to Ozomos way better"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service and prices is what I'm not impressed with. He likes to charge for everything extra no wonder they don't have repeat customers."}
{"text":"This place seems to be getting a bad wrap, and to be honest, I don't understand why...  Conveniently located on Living Arts Drive, directly across the street from the new Sheridan College Mississauga campus and at the base of the condos where TD Help & Advice Center and Union Burger are. It's literally a 5 minute walk away from Celebration Square.  Family owned and operated, the husband and wife team that run this place (helped out by their adult kids) are incredibly hospitable and friendly.  The design aesthetic is a beautiful hybird between a take-away spot and an elegant sit down restaurant, the cool thing is that the owner used to be an architect and designed the space entirely himself. Super cool! Even better - they've got Free Wifi so if you're taking a working lunch (or taking a break from school-- this is the place).  One word that describes their food offerings is; value. You get so much for so little that I don't honestly know how they get by. The mixed grill platter has so much food in it that two people could easily share it an be stuffed!  Their specialty rice is something called Cinnamon Rice, which is totally different and equally mind blowing! I'm not usually a 'rice person' but this was so different I had to finish my plate.  For the 'on the go' person, I'd highly recommend their shawarma sandwiches and/or their mediterranean philly cheese steak sandwich. Both pretty darn tasty and good bang for you buck!  Check this place out and tell them that Kris from Yelp sent you ;)"}
{"text":"No don't go here. My first experience was bad. Food wasn't fresh. Over priced. But then I went again. Same thing. Too bad because I love Mediterranean :("}
{"text":"Poor service and mediocre food which is unfortunate because the location is so close to me. Try it for yourself but I have no urge to ever go back"}
{"text":"I hope they go out of business soon because they dont know how to make Mediterranean food. The only reason they get people is because of the location. Plus 90% of these people dont come back because the food tastes bad and not healthy. They should call this restaurant the egyptian village instead"}
{"text":"I got food from here about 2 months ago! Would never go back. The chicken is all fat and uncooked. I did not even bother talking to them just threw away the food! I hope no one gets sick. The only reason they are popular is because of their location. Hope they improve their food quality soon."}
{"text":"This place is located close to Square One and right next to Union Burger. I decided to give this place a try since I was back in 'Sauga for a day before taking off to the US again tomorrow.    I ordered a mixed grill platter, which had a kebob, skewer of beef tenderloin, shish tawouk (chicken breast), with salad, rice, potatoes and hummus.  Overall the food was tasty, but I found the chicken breast a bit dry, however, the kebob and tenderloin were very tasty.   But what I really really really loved was the taste of the hummus!.  That was amazing!  Everything seems reasonable and maybe next time I'll try the shawarma as a lot of people were ordering it."}
{"text":"Came to this place for the first time without reading any of the past reviews. My experience wasn't nearly as bad as what some of the people said below. Maybe I was really hungry when I came here?  Regardless. The chicken was tender and cooked quite well. Veggies and condiments are somewhat average - something you'd expect from all the shawarma places around. Nothing too fancy. But the meats certainly make up for it. I've had my fair share of shawarma-eating and this one - to my surprise - actually ranks quite high on my list.   If you live in the proximity of square one or just happen to be in the area, I'd recommend this place. I'd definitely be back here as well."}
{"text":"It took over 2 years, but I finally went back today for a quick dinner.   I've come to the conclusion that Mediterranean Village has either gotten a LOT better over this time, or I was simply the unfortunate victim of a one-off experience.   I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap again.   This time, the vegetables were fresh, the chicken was warm, and the wrap was altogether flavourful. They used this new creamy sauce that I don't remember having during my first time there, which definitely added to the wrap's flavour. The pita itself wasn't anything special but it's come to be expected with pre-made breads. Not an issue.  Service was also decent, there was a dinner rush and the lineup was handled well.  All in all, I'm very pleased, and will return."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 6~7 times, and the only reason why I come here is because it's in my building. Prices don't justify their average food and I agree with Eddie that the owner likes to charge for everything extra. One time I asked for some extra pickles and he wanted to charge me 5 dollars (a small container's worth). This is my first time being asked to pay for some extra pickles at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga.   Another time when I got 8 falafels, I asked the owner for more tahini sauce because one very small container of taihini didn't seem enough to cover all the falafels. He seemed unimpressed and told me that they give only 1 container of tahini for every 4 falafels - proving to himself that he should have given me 2 containers of tahini for my 8 falafels in the first place, instead of just one! Again, this is my first time having a problem with asking for more sauce at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga.   Their adult children provide very good service when they're occasionally working, but overall, I strongly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cheaper alternative to other places in the area besides maybe the Square One Food court. Chicken Schwarma was okay, not the best I've had but not the worst neither. The schwarma poutine seems to be a popular dish here."}
{"text":"I came in with my girlfriend for dinner and thought the place was amazing. The staff is curteous and friendly. I've never had Mediterranean food before but ever since then I'll be coming back for more!!  The atmosphere had a very family-type vibe to it.   I'd definitely recommend this place!!"}
