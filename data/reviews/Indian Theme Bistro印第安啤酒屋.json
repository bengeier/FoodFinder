{"text":"Highly recommend! This place is super cool,karaoke room is a good place for a party. Like here's American Indian style. Food and service are great."}
{"text":"They have really delicious fish dish. It's made of a whole fish and five kinds of vegetables boiled in spicy sauce, if you like spicy sauce and fish, this is a place to enjoy. They also have non spicy dishes and skewers. I am a spicy food lover so love pretty much everything here. The skewers taste fresh and yummy. AND this is a place that has karaoke rooms, so it's perfect for group hangouts. It was my second time here already, will come back again."}
{"text":"Food is sooo tasty! And their karaoke is awesome! Had lots of fun with my friends in there:) And I also like its decorative style so much?"}
{"text":"My mom loves Sichuan food so we came to try Indian out. The restaurant is quite small with just a few tables; I think at night the karaoke factor plays a big role.

Service was okay, and food portions were fair. The food was tasty but not mindblowing. I think this is a place to come to get food to supplement a karaoke outing, but necessarily worth a dedicated trip for their food alone."}
{"text":"We  have been going to this restaurant for years, but recently we found all the dishes are super salty and tasted almost the same due to the heavy spices they tasted alike.  Even with beer, it is difficult to digest such heavy dishes."}
{"text":"This place has a great deal for the karaoke rooms! It's free as long as you and your party spend $100! My party of 6 spent 5 hours singing our hearts away! The server was very attentive and appeared in no time at a click of the service button. The food was enjoyable as well! The only downside for English song singers is that they don't have the greatest selection. Like how can they not have Britney Spear's classics?"}
{"text":"Great place to come! Rooms are so private. Servers are pretty and professional, everything has been taken good care of. The price is reasonable. Nice decoration and delicious food there. Come and check it out!"}
