{"text":"Great little caf√©!!!  I could smell the delicious food walking into the business center!  I had the special, Pesto King, on the noble bread and it was amazing.   The soup of the day was delish as well.   Great food, and great people!  They greet you with a smile right when you walk in!  I'll definitely be back to try out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!  I am a picky and healthy eater and they have great options for me, plus the service is great! They remember your name and are always so incredibly kind. Both my husband and I eat there multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to get some healthy food.  Staff is courteous and respectful, the ambiance is great, and the menu is excellent.  Kudos, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Superette cafe is new and improved with great, friendly people!! Daily specials - you wouldn't think you could find biscuits and gravy, protein cheesecake, Matcha green tea smoothies, caramel macchiatos, and amazing sandwiches on Noble bread at a place like this!! They even have buttermilk pancakes occasionally!! The chef, Todd, is really amazing at keeping his customers entertained as well as FED!!!!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is no ordinary food factory. At the Superette Cafe you're treated to a diverse menu of well-crafted, tasty food with a twist of healthy ingredients and preparation. The health factor is a huge plus, especially for us daytime desk dwellers who can definitely appreciate the benefits of eating a light breakfast or lunch.  The staff is very friendly and the prices are in the ball park of what you'd expect. As I said, you can't discount the health factor and quality of the food. I also love the convenient location (I actually work in a suite directly behind the cafe) and the amazing turnaround time, which make the Superette Cafe an excellent choice if you need to eat breakfast or lunch during crunch time -- pun very much intended.  So the next time you're in the area and craving a fresh, delicious sandwich with the finest Boar's Head meats and cheeses (try the Farm Club or Godmother -- you won't be disappointed), a refreshing smoothie with a protein or energy boost, or savory breakfast and weekly specials, stop by the Superette Cafe.  Bottom line: The Superette Cafe is my go-to place for tasty, healthy food and drinks that keep me happy and productive throughout my busy workday."}
{"text":"Chef Cara really transformed this cafe. Really impressive. Now the food is healthful, delicious and fresh (ok, there are some cheat treats available too). The offices inside this corporate building are lucky to have this right in the lobby!  Superette serves both vegan and non-vegan. I'm vegan had no trouble having a fantastic lunch.  I recommend going out of your way for lunch here. Be sure to say hello to Chef Cara"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we stumbled upon this real food cafe! It's a local gem! You can order anything off their menu and know you're getting a healthy meal! I ordered the paleo bowl and my husband got a breakfast burrito. I also got a superfood coffee! We will definitely be back and can't wait to try lunch! It's tucked inside a corporate building--but super easy to find! Go now! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a healthy lunch! I got the fiesta wrap and it had the perfect amount of ingredients and flavor. The prices are very affordable too which, is nice. I would highly recommend anyone to come in and grab a bite to eat here."}
{"text":"A cozy eatery with made to order, health conscience options that burst with flavor. Staff is knowledgeable and answer questions and welcome special requests.  Limited seating so call ahead."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that it's a super convenient location. I mean who doesn't love an eatery in their office building?. However, if you enjoy paying $5 for one slice of Avocado toast this is place, I'm not a fan. Being that I can purchase an entire loaf of delicious bread from Trader Joe's and an avocado for just about the same price. I'm very disappointed in the lack of consistency with the prices. One week my order was a different price every day. I was told by the staff that the prices were going to go up, but who can afford breakfast everyday that is between $5-$10 on average. Not the majority of the people that work in this building. I feel that the owner is greedy and he knows that the customers are not happy with the price increase.  I understand that he has a business to run but soon their will be no business if there are no satisfied customers. I will now be bringing my breakfast everyday instead. It was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  They just recently updated their menu to include a wider variety of healthier breakfast and lunch options, but don't let that scare you away if you're not into healthy!  They have something for everyone.  Their food is fresh and they don't take any shortcuts.  In fact, they just told me that they make their own croutons which are amazing.  Chef Cara and her staff are always helpful with ordering if you're not too sure of what you want and they bring a smile to your face every time you step into the cafe.  In addition to the great selection of good food (everything I've had was spectacular) and friendly service, they're about as quick as can be with their made to order menu.  Anytime I order, my food is ready within 10 minutes.  If you don't have that kind of time you can always call in your order in advance.  Oh and they have snacks; both healthy and unhealthy (if you feel like cheating a little).  Location: they're located in an office building, so if you have trouble finding it it's because you need to go into the building.  They don't have their own entrance or anything like that.  Parking: the parking garage is reserved for tenants on the first couple of levels but there's temporary 15 minute parking close to the lobby doors and an uncovered lot for visitors."}
{"text":"Working in this office building Superette has definitely made having a healthy breakfast or lunch much easier. Tasty food and good people!"}
{"text":"The reviews looked really great so we walked over from the Embassy suites. ( about a mile) The hours weren't posted and it said it served breakfast but when we got there on Saturday morning at 8:30 it was closed. Boo!"}
{"text":"This cafe is located in side the office buildings near Walmart. They have amazing fresh cooked food! The best part? It's all extremely healthy! Definitely coming back and looking forward to trying more on their menu! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT. Me and my employees work directly above them in the building, so we are super close. The girls down there literally KILL it every day and are most always right on time. After a handful of orders, they remembered us by voice and remember our usual orders. With a building full of people ordering all day, the fact that they remember our individual orders amazes me. They are always spot on, have excellent prices and service that brings us back on a daily. We are customers for life! THANKS SUPERETTE!"}
{"text":"Super cute small cafe inside an office building. Great healthy menu- not your normal office luncheonette! Yum!!!! They care about whether you like your food!!"}
