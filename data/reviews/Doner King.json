{"text":"Very good especially for the markham area. I always get the Doner plate and Doner fries, always consistent and gets me hungry while driving back home. Have to go back to try the goat doner but this is my 4th time eating the chicken, always juicy and tender."}
{"text":"Great menu with great food. The mini sandwich is really good. Had both the chicken and the goat both were really good. Filled with lots of spices and flavours. Also the fries with chicken was great."}
{"text":"Such friendly service & really good food. Got the chicken döner plate w all toppings & sauces & was not disappointed. Food is cheap w generous portions"}
{"text":"The hell you reading this for? You gotta try this place, it doesn't look like much but my god is their sandwich good."}
{"text":"Eat like a KING for less than $10. Done! its to bad yelp wont let u write such a short review.  sometimes a little goes a long way!! anyways this place has unbelievably good food! small menu , but  everything works!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I remember enjoying it the first time as well.

I had the chicken mini-donair at $3.81, a nice even $4 after tax.

It took them quite awhile to make it and the place was not overly busy. I like my food piping hot and this was not that, being just heated up. The flavours were very nice and something different from the predominant Asian food in the area. I heard they had goat and would like to try that.

There are only five red bar stools to sit and as others have said, it looks clean and uncluttered.

Bottom line, it didn't blow me away but it was done well enough and unique enough to make me want to come back again.

4.0 Stars

I actually ate this on National Sandwich day not knowing that it was that day."}
{"text":"I love their combination doner chicken and lamb meal with rice. Plus they give you salad, hummus, and special sauces. 

I try to come back here whenever I am in town visiting family."}
{"text":"Great, family owned spot. On Friday and Saturday, they offer a \"doner kuthu roti\" that has great taste and is very filling. The portion it comes in is enough to fill two (average sized) people. The \"spicy\" option is actually spicy, and it is so good! I'd definitely order it again. Not much room for seating inside, but the food was made fresh and was still steaming hot when we got home. Heard great things about their fries as well. The food selection might seem small but I think it works well and it is not overwhelming at all. I would go again :)"}
{"text":"Whoa ! I've always wanted to try this place out after reading so many incredible reviews. And it didn't disappoint !!! 


The set up of the place is meant for takeout / grabbing a quick bite. They don't have an extensive menu, but if you do something well, one or two is more than plenty. We ordered the chicken doner plate and chicken doner fries. They filled the plate with rice, veggies, and three different sources (garlic, hummus, hot sauce). We were also given a generous amount of chicken with the plate. The chicken doner fries is incredible too ! Filled with fresh fries and sharwama chicken. 

Would definitely recommend ! Great food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Got a chicken doner sandwich and it was HUGE! loaded with lots of chicken. If you are hungry for a quick bite, check this place out!
Friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house so I decided to pop in and give it a try , I had their chicken fries Doner for the very first time and it was just delicious. Fries were crunchy, hot sauce was flavourful and not too spicy which I prefer and the chicken was tender. If you are really hungry I recommend that you stop by and give it a try, portions are huge. I would go back again for the Doner fries. 
I just wanna point out their menu it's pretty eye catching, simple and modern."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich combo ( included fries & a pop can) for $9.15. The server was a really kind & friendly gentlemen and he was very interactive and helpful. The chicken is very delicious & not dry, but the fries weren't as good as I hoped or wished for it to be. You are allowed to put any toppings on your sandwhich & i had about 4 to 5 options, not bad! But none the less, the meal was pleasant!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner option. Ended up trying the doner plate, amazing food loved the flavours and thy are pretty generous with the quantity"}
{"text":"Really thankful for Yelp for helping me find this place! I got the chicken fries for $6.99 and it was enormous! They give a generous amount of chicken and fries. The chicken was tender and extremely delicious! The hot sauce isn't too spicy and you can tell that it is homemade. Coming back to try everything else!

The owner is really nice and talked with my friends and I, telling us about the restaurant, food, ingredients. He offered us 3 sample sizes of the chicken while waiting (the samples were big). He talked about his life. It was refreshing having such outstanding customer service. He even let us try the garlic sauce and try the beef.

I highly recommend anyone on the fence of trying out the place, to give it a try! The place deserves a 5 star rating. It is very clean. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for a quick bite. Wanted to try something new and found this place. We got the doner chicken fries and doner chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint. I was impressed by the amount of food I got for the price I paid. The sandwich and fries came loaded with chicken.
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Great food at an amazing price.  Small menu with chicken/beef sandwich or on a plate.   Food is very fresh and the salad is delicious!  The amount of food is enough for 2 people when it comes to the plate order which is only $10 plus tax.  They only accept cash or debit!"}
{"text":"Among all the Hakka, Indian , Sri Lankan and generally Asian food that can be found in this area- Doner King is wonderful stand out. We got drawn to this place by the name Doner, which was the go to fast food back when we were in Germany. And this place keeps the standard. The fast food is fast, but at the same time they take their time with each order ensuring quality. Wonderful service and we will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Döner King is such a refresher in the midst of an overpopulated Asian food market that saturates the area.

The portions are pretty large and filling, so I can't complain. I went for the chicken döner fries this time and the guy behind the counter (he's the owner's son) was so nice to sauce it up for me since I love tahini, however I found the hot sauce to be a bit too much to my liking. It's never really crowded when I come here unless it's lunch on a weekday, so I generally try to avoid that time slot. Definitely a must try if in the area! - No ragretz -"}
{"text":"This is hands down my go-to spot for the ultimate meal. Not only is the menu very reasonably priced, but the food is always delicious and the customer service is exceptional! I always get the Chicken Shawarma fries whenever I'm craving comfort food. For only $6.99+tax, you get a whole container of goodness. I would also recommend the Mini Chicken Doner sandwich which is $3.81, for $4 you basically get a sub. 
I recommend anyone in the area to give this a try, if you're into anything spicy/flavourful, try the Chicken Fries!! For a cheap snack, get the Mini Doner. 
 
(BTW Doner King is amazing for munchies)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend, and the little restaurant seemed pretty busy. We ordered the beef sandwich with a drink, and it came to 9$. The store owner asked if it was our first time, and gave us a small container of rice, chicken, and the three sauces (garlic, hummus, and hot sauce). That was really nice of him, and I really appreciated the free sample. The garlic sauce is amazing - and although the sandwich wasn't out of this world, it was definitely well balanced and quite good. I thought I wouldn't like the bread, but I ended up enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. Excited to come back and try the dinner plate sometime. Solid food at an affordable price, and extremely friendly owners!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. I ordered the chicken doner fries. My SO ordered a mini sandwich which is the size of a banh mi sandwich.

Hearty, saucy, and spicy so don't forget your drink with food! Delicious and made fresh to order. Owner was nice and said their hot sauce, hummus, and garlic sauce were made in house.  Will return if in the area. Bon appetit! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken sandwich with German flatbread! Super fresh ingredients and tasty, will definitely come back when I am in the area. The owner is super friendly too. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great local family business operated by a friendly father and son - mostly catering to takeout.

If you're looking for what's left of cheap eats in this city, definitely check this place out for a humongous portion of doner for under $10. 

I highly recommend you choose the chicken option because it's nice and tender, which complements the crunchy pickled veggies and sauces so well. 

I would definitely come back when looking for a quick cheap eat!"}
{"text":"Wow Bruv,

This place probably messed it up for all the shawarma spots around my work place. The Goat Doner was phenomenal. 

This is a new establishment and they have 0 dine in abilities. Strictly take out from the looks of it. The place has all new features as the rottiserie, counter and everything else was shining brand new. 

Now historically, doner is meant to be more so of a gyro (iskander) style while this place has the traditional shawarma approach. However the bread they use is different from all the other shawarma places that I have tried. It is almost an afghan naan cut in the middle and stuffed with delicious well flavored meat and fresh toppings. I asked for the extra spicy and they delivered.

The sandwich was a monster. Fit both my hands and more. It was a bit messy to eat, however that made the experience even better as I scoffed down the sandwich in record timing.

I am going back, and if you haven't been. You should!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and now I can say I found my new spot when it comes to getting gyros in the area which is pretty hard to find with all the Chinese restaurants everywhere you turn, Oh look there's one right beside you! Haha 

Portions are generous, ingredients are fresh, rotisserie are kept at a lower temperature to make sure meat is still juicy but turned up when served. Nothing really more to ask for. I've so far tried the chicken on fries and a mixed platter. I'm really digging the beef but the chicken is also very good. Pardon my ignorance but from the first visit i had no idea that beef = gyro until I decided to try the beef but got it mixed as a safer bet just in case things didn't go down too well. 

The people behind the counter are very helpful when it comes down to deciding which carb you want since they only have chicken and beef for portion. The fries are good but if you want something a little less greasy especially with all the sauces try the sandwich and platter. The sandwich is HUGE although I've never ordered it I've seen it being made and they make sure to pack it in nice. The platter is a safe bet if you're the type to deconstruct and taste everything piece by piece. 

Overall I'm glad these guys opened up last year giving the community a little more variety when it comes to grabbing a quick bite. The store is kept clean and service is pretty on point as well."}
{"text":"Simple, unassuming restaurant front. The guy who served us is very nice and spoke with my German dad about German stuff. I got the chicken plate and the portions are pretty generous. Very flavorful food. The spicy sauces are pretty spicy."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite and was in the area. Who knew there was a doner place uptown?! Tried the chicken doner sandwich and fries and it did not disappoint. First the amount of food you get for the price is amazing. Both was 15$! And they definitely loaded the fries and sandwich with the chicken. The fires were a tad overcooked but the rest of the meal made up for it.  There was a good balance between flavours and just enough heat. What's even better is staff are really friendly and welcoming. Will definitely add this to my go to places of the area."}
{"text":"We came tonight to try the Doner sandwich amd Doner plate.  We wanted to try one goat and one chicken but the goat meat was all sold out for the day.  So reluctantly, we had to get chicken for both.  Usually, the chicken meat served this way is dry but the chicken here was extremely juicy and not dry at all.  The plate comes with rice, salad, tabouli, sauces and meat.  The sandwich is pretty huge and we got everything on it.  It was delicious with all the different toppings and sauces.  There's garlic sauce, hummus, hot sauce, ranch sauce and tahini.  We wanted to get a side of garlic potatoes but they were sold out too.  We were there at around 6.45pm on a Saturday night.

We will definitely return and hopefully get to try the goat, next time.  But the chicken meat was nice and juicy.  A good place to get a filling and cheap meal."}
{"text":"Live close by to this place and decided to check this place out.

Picked up food for the whole family. I must warn you, the size of the doner sandwich is no joke. Come with an appetite, or be warned you will end up with a food baby. They definitely don't cheap out on your meat. 

Ordered the chicken doner sandwich (6.49) the chicken fries (6.49) the mini chicken sandwich (around 2.50?). Definitely was happy with the value for the amount of food.

Friendly workers behind the counter and food was ready pretty quickly. Would definitely go back for a bite, probably just the mini sandwich portion because even that was a good size."}
{"text":"I'll keep it concise as I can:

Got a chicken shawarma plate(10,99), beef fries(6,99), and a mini chicken sandwich(3,99). While waiting someone over the counter offered us some chicken to sample and then some hot sauce. That was nice, and it was a decent sample too haha. Hot sauce is tasty and has a really nice punch to it. 

In the shawarma plate they pack the ever loving shit out of it and you WILL be full. Coleslaw was salty but everything else was delicious. 

Should have got the chicken fries instead of the beef fries like the other reviews suggest. Was tryna be different.

Mini chicken sandwich is decent sized. With the Banh Mi shop around the corner in the same plaza I may be switching my cheap-sandwich-go-to to this place.

Jeez that wasn't short at all.."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken sandwich doner for about $7.5

Pros:
-Fresh ingredients
-Big servings
-Good for your money

Cons:
-Upon entering, I almost hesitated to place my order as it appears the meat has been sitting there for quite some time. The server turned it to high heat for 2 mins for my order.
-I requested Extra Spicy, but their hot sauce is not even hot.
-When eating, I would get either all chicken or all veggie on each bite. They should do something about mixing it up better.

I'm a shawarma lover, and I'll be sticking to those, even though they are very similar to doner."}
{"text":"Summary: big portion, tender meat, awesome fries. Allergy concerns assuaged, we are now talking about the tastiest meat sandwiches in the east Markham/north Scarborough area. Move over, schwarmas.

This family owned shop is simple and minimalistic, serving doners, which are essentially a German street food that is similar to schwarma, being cut off a roast. (Either chicken or beef - personally, I think chicken here is better).

As of December 2017, it's:
$6.99 for a sandwich
$9.99 for a rice plate
$3.81 for a mini sandwich

Sandwich is a pretty sizable bun, although the bun can be a bit dry. However, they PACK it was sauce (three kinds) plus an assortment of toppings.

Donair fries are just GOOD and will change how you feel about fries.

Sauces on the bread:
Garlic
Hummus
Hot sauce

Sauces on the chicken/meat:
Tahini
Ranch
Hot sauce"}
{"text":"Good thing Dude lives close by because then I could actually have a legit excuse to come here. 

Portions are MASSIVE and that's so beautiful. We ordered takeout because we're bums. This is our second time going, and we dressed even bummier than last time. Dude wore this hoodie that looked like it hasn't seen the light of day since he graduated. 

Meat was flavourful and beautiful. Usually places dump a lot of veg as a filler but not these people!! They probably sensed I'm 90% carnivore and decided to give a ton of meat. 

The potato strip things??? They were great too, but the meat really took the spotlight. Also, they give you a dip with it. I find that you should just smother the rice with the dip because the meat itself is already perfect. 

I want to live INSIDE this restaurant because it's so amazing. 

However, we went last night and Yelp says it closes at 10, but we went in at 9:43 and the staff said they're already closed. :( Why you gotta do me like that, fam??

I still love you, though."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews so soon. I ordered the beef sandwich. It is absolutely amazing I'm eating it right now as I'm using Google Voice to Text. It was just too good it is just too good. This will be my new go-to place for any Shawarma style Donair. This is way better than a shawarma. The bread is different. The meat tastes good. It's also hello. Only thing I might recommend is to have a little less salt but I can't take a star off because the price is too good. I think I'm going to be a very regular customer here. This is amazing."}
{"text":"After 20+ visits I'm still in love! Updating my review from 4 to 5 stars. As one of the first reviewers I didn't want to give it that 5 star rating off the bat but they've earned it 100%."}
{"text":"Great place for Doner! They made chicken salad for me which is not on the menu. Good price!"}
{"text":"Saw this the other day and decided to come by today for dinner with the bf. 

Walk in only.. had one chair if someone wanted to sit.. the menu is simple with a few option. They said they will eventually add some more stuff to it later on maybe. . It's a family owned place, he said it's more  European style not the Nova Scotia style. 

They were out of chicken so we decided to try the goat (he let us try some before) we both got the mini which was still a big bun size. It was delicious! Garlic spread..humus..hot sauce.. meat..tomato/ onion salad mixture..and tahini sauce... 

We will be coming back to hopefully to try everything at least once on the menu! 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I just came here once and I love it already! This is a great place for a cheap and delicious meal. 

I ordered the chicken döner sandwich (I would have ordered a goat but they didn't have any when I went). The sandwich was just $6.49 (before tax) and was huge! Totally worth your money in my opinion. 

You get to choose what toppings and sauces you want on your sandwich. I chose to get some of everything on mine. Everything tasted amazingly good together. So much flavor in each and every bite!

It doesn't take long for them to prepare your food but do expect to wait a while if there is a line up. I had to wait about 15 minutes with 5 people in front of me before they took my order. 

The place itself is meant for takeout as there are no tables. There are only 2 seats in a corner. 

I think they only take cash and debit.

I'll be returning here for sure!"}
{"text":"Chicken doner frys are awesome :) great place to eat, little spicy but soo good, always perfect service and food :DDDDDDDDD"}
{"text":"Limited menu: best thing on there is the Chicken Doner and their yummy sauces (ranch, tahini, hot sauce). Chicken is tender and flavorful and the sauces are zesty with a touch of heat. Sandwiches are BIG and reasonably priced. Clean space with 5 stools (be careful, they're not very stable) and bar tables. Staff are efficient but not the warmest. 

Not recommended:
- Beef tastes like processed meat bleh!
- Fries taste twice cooked with a mushy middle.
- Salad: they use the same veggies and sauces as they put in their sandwiches."}
{"text":"You have to try it! Not only is the price very affordable ($6.49) for the Chicken Doner Sandwich, but it is HUGE! Regardless of how far you live, it is worth the trip to try this savory masterpiece. The combination of succulent chicken, crisp vegetables, and assortment of sauces makes this a messy, but oh so good!

Even if you are a big eater like me, you will won't be leaving hungry. Instead you will be cradling your food baby on your way out."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Hands down one of the best spots in the area. The portions are so much more than the price!! I recommend everyone to get the chicken plate there!!  My brother and I enjoyed our meal. The staff there are so sweet and the customer service is awesome. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I passed by this place because i was craving a doner after reminiscing about berlin, where i had my first initiation to this wonderful dish. High ratings led to high expectations which ultimately led to mild dissapointment. The doner wasnt bad by any means but this was not even close to the doner i had in berlin. Customer service was good and the place is very small so you have to take it to go. I do not think toronto has any good doner places, the quest continues to find one......"}
{"text":"Had the Doner Fries with chicken. It's ON POINT! I don't know what extra they do with the meat but it's consistently juicy, tender and full of flavour."}
{"text":"TL:DR - both the beef and chicken döner sandwiches were amazing!

I've always walked by this small restaurant but never thought to give it a try. After seeing such great reviews on Yelp, my friend and I decided to check it out for lunch. My friend had the Döner sandwich with beef and I had the Mini Chicken Döner. First and foremost, the portions were extremely generous and my friend loved how there was meat in every bite! The meat itself was extremely flavourful as well without being too salty! The chicken was crispy and tender. Most of all, their service was amazing. The owner was friendly and great to chat with. I really loved this place and would definitely go back regularly!"}
{"text":"We looked this place up on yelp and got here on a warm Sunday at around 6:30pm. The place was empty. We ordered their chicken donair plates, a chicken donair sandwhich and fries. The food is inexpensive and delicious! They were generous with the portions, the chicken was juicy & tender while the veggies were crisp  GET THEIR FRIES! Bummed they were out of goat donair though. Had a nice chat with the young  guy behind the counter whose family owns the place.. he said they might bring back goat - will definitely go back if they do!"}
{"text":"Although I have been to this plaza many times over the last few years I've only noticed it recently.
Decided to try this place out a few weeks back and I did not regret it! 
Upon entrance, the place was small but very clean. Though they have a few seats inside for dining in, it is more ideal as a takeout. 
The menu selection is very limited but it doesn't matter because what they do offer is very delicious! 
The owners provide both excellent quality and quantity of food all for just under $10.00!! 
I tried the chicken doner plate ($9.99) and it was very flavourful! The combination of the salad, chicken, rice and sauces all blended very well! It was just an explosion of different taste and texture that complimented each other greatly. I also got more chicken than rice on my plate which was a plus. 
The Doner fries ($6.99) is also a must try! For such a price, you get maximum value. The owner had stuffed a whole lot of fries and chicken in the box that it was hard to close up due to the over fill. The fries just tasted amazing and there was an array of different sauces added on that is different to what you have eaten before. 
The customer service was just as good as the food. They were very friendly and you can tell they work hard in ensuring the customer is satisfied. 
Random fact: They were also featured on BlogTO.
All in all, I would definitely come back and I highly recommend everyone to give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"The one thing I am always scared of is portion size. The taste is awesome, we all know that already. But the portions and the amount of sauce they give you is PLENTY. I even thought about getting extra meat when I ordered, but I honestly don't think I could've finished it! This is a great place. Gonna come back often."}

i ordered the beef doner fries and was completely blown away.  generous beef portions, well-seasoned (maybe a bit too salty for some palates, but perfect for me) and covered in delicious garlic and hot sauces.  all for $7 too?  take my damn money

i'm salivating while writing this review... i might just drive all the way to scarborough to get some doner fries right now"}
{"text":"This place is misleadingly rated hughly. The prices are very affordable which may be why. The chicken doner sandwich had a very bad texture. There  were slimy bits which inam assuming was the skin. The bread was decent though. The produce was of the lowest quality you can find tomato was bland and the slaw was average at best. I would have rated it lower but i am factoring in the price to give a solid 3'atars"}
{"text":"I never write reviews normally but this place blew my mind. 

I tried Döner King because my sister recommended it. I'm glad she did. Right from the start the experience was great. The person helping us was really nice and friendly.

In terms of the food... Unbelievably amazing! For $10, had 2 mini Döners (beef and chicken). Both were really good but I personally fell in love with the beef Döner. Layers of meat slathered with 3 amazing sauces and 2 toppings of your choice. It's bite after bite of deliciousness. It does have a spicy kick to it, but only in the best of ways?. I'm pretty sure I can have this sandwich again and again and again."}

On my friend's birthday, we decided to come try this place out finally. I was looking at what to get, and I was really craving some fries. I ended up getting the Döner Fries with all three sauces. You have a mix between spicy, tangy, and creamy; basically the holy trinity of sauces. How can you say no to fries, chicken and amazing sauces? And at $6.99?!

This is probably my favourite place to get some chicken/fries. Definitely try this place out whenever you have the chance to!!"}
{"text":"For my kebab lovers, you have to try this place. The menu is really straight forward, doesn't really tell you what goes in what but everything is laid out to you and you get to choose what you want (for sandwiches and plates only). I tried the chicken döner fries ($6.99) and chicken döner sandwich ($6.99) and I have nothing but positive feedback for this place. The portions are more than generous especially for the price you're paying - EVERYTHING is less than $10. The sandwich was huge and sooo good (tip: don't skip out on any of the sauces and try their chicken... it was tender and juicy). The servers/owners are father and son and they were very nice and polite. The space itself is fairly small with bar tables against the windows so I do suggest ordering for take-out instead but seriously, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Fiance and I passed by here multiple times and we always said that we'd try it. So we finally did and my goodness... I'm so glad we did! 

We ordered the chicken doner plate ($10ish) and the chicken doner fries ($7ish). 
I will warn you now, if you plan on sharing the food -  that would be a mistake. As soon as I took a bite of the food, I wish that I didn't agree to share this meal haha. 
The portions were extremely generous. Dishes are well seasoned and full flavoured. The chicken was still deliciously moist.
It was just sooooooooo good. Stop reading. Go try it now!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and came down here on a weekday for lunch. 

Crazy drivers in this neighbourhood but worth it. You don't get a ton of options, but enough to make me want to come back again to try the rest, or even order the same thing again.

They prepare the meat fresh in the morning, so none of that frozen stuff. The guy working there is awesome!! 10/10 for service. Makes sure you have everything you want and is very helpful when it comes to indecisive me.

The portions end up being massive. I was pretty hungry and I only finished about 70% of the food, which I took it to go. A really odd thing that I liked about Doner King..they use high quality aluminum foil. It was satisifying to re-wrap my food and take it to go without the foil tearing!!

In terms of the food, it was amazing..heavenly. The sauce and the well cooked meat combined to give this amazing texture and flavour. Not too sure what kind of spices they used, but it sealed the deal! Yum!

Shoutout to the guy working here, and for keeping this cute takeout place the cleanest takeout restaurant I've been to. Cannot recommend this place enough!

:)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times now, I always order the chicken doner fries. The guy working the front (appears to be owners son) is really friendly and a quick worker. He always fries the fries fresh, right infront of you. I like their method of making it, they put a layer of fries and chicken and cover it in garlic and hot sauce then cover that with fries and again with sauce. Most flavourful fry based meal I've ever had! Cheap and really big portions (works out to around 7 - 8 after tax). Picture was taken after I had already eaten the top part of it.

Actual location only has a few seats as it is more of a takeout oriented restaurant. Restaurant is clean, welcoming and usually not crazy packed (unless you come right around lunch hour rush). 

I'll have to try the actual doner sandwiches one day, but the fries are too damn tempting!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for such great prices! 100% would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sandwiches and dinner plates. I've even had their salads which are very good also."}
{"text":"This is a very good place. Very good Turkish style Donair's. Lots of choices and sauces. I always get the beef. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is the owner is always late. Sign says they open at 11 am they are never there till at least 1130 if not later. Dispite this it is a great place to go if you are in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"This place has turned out to be a Markham staple. I usually get a mini Doner (not pictured) or a mixed Doner on salad with extra garlic sauce. Another popular dish is the Doner fries (pictured).. I am never disappointed with the service or quality of their food. Family owned restaurant serving up some soul food... really hard to find now a days! 

Definitely recommend this place if anyone is in the area!"}
{"text":"I was extremely satisfied with the service I received here.

As soon as I entered, my order was taken and I was served with food promptly. With a simple menu to choose from I ordered the chicken donair plate along with the chicken fries. 

The quality of the meat was amazing. He confirmed that it was halal meat and the order from sergeant farms in Mississauga. 

The hot sauce is amazinnnng, my favourite thus far. I like it because it's not pure hot, it has flavour to it that's makes you want more and more! 

I'll be back for sure :)"}

{"text":"Great food and even better customer service. The restaurant is super clean! I haven't been to a really clean restaurant like this in a while. Their food comes in big quantity and very cheap! $7 for a bug plate of doner fries. They also serve halal meat!

Their ranch sauce for their doner fries is a bit tangy so I would recommend getting a little of it and not too much."}
{"text":"Chicken Doner Kebab Sanddwich ($6.49) is huge! Great for sharing! 

I asked for extra spicy and the staff did a really good job. My co worker who has a high tolerance of heat said \"oh so spicy!!

Now they have a little bar seat area at the front of the store if you want to eat in. 

Simple menu and fast service. Great to pick up something quick for lunch.

Goat Doner?! That will be next!"}
{"text":"I just had their gyro and omg amazing.  There's so much flavour in the meat.  I've tried a lot of shawarma/doner places and this is the best one when it comes to the plate option (rice+meat)"}
{"text":"Went earlier today. Great sandwich, very generous in portion size. Huge sandwich filled with flavoured chicken as well as a mix of veggies. The sandwich with a can of pop for approximately $8. Can't go wrong. You should try it out. The donair sandwich takes on a similar approach to a shawarma sandwich. Enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here, and the Doner sandwich is excellent. I prefer the chicken to the beef, and the size is absolutely huge! The owners were amazing, and very friendly people. They offered me a sample of the Kothu Roti which they offer only on Saturdays, and it was really tasty, and perfectly spicy. Will definitely be back next Saturday to get a full order! Great spot, will be visiting frequently for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I got the chicken shawarma plate and it came with rice, choice of salads (you can pick up to three), sauces, humus, garlic sauce, and meat. The food is fresh and quite tasty. They are very generous with the servings and it only costs $10. One shawarma plate can probably fill you for two meals. The owners are friendly as well so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum.

I was recently introduced to Doner King by my friends via the famous Doner Fries. Really good. They've simplified their menu to a few items and just two proteins: beef or chicken. It's also halal! 

They have \"Doner Fries\" which is a glorified shawarma style poutine that is really delicious. It's very hardy and the portions are large so you can easily share for two if you want a snack, or just one whole box for yourself if you're really hugnry. They are very generous with the protein as well so every bite is accompanied by deliciousness. They also have mini doners and sandwiches/plates which are all really at a great price; the highest being $9.99 for the plates. 

The place itself is not really a sit-in type style place, and more takeout. You can hardly contain yourself when the aromas fill your car up on the way home. 

Really recommended for some good, cheap eats in the Markham/Scarborough area."}
{"text":"For the price, the amount of fresh food you get is more than worth it! My favorite is definitely the chicken, it's a unique blend of spices that I can't get enough of. Most people assume shawarma as soon as they see meat on a spat, Doner is a turkish dish (FYI). As someone who always eats big meals trust me one chicken plate or even chicken sandwich from here will prove to be plenty of food.

This is more of a take out place, although there are some bench seats to sit down at. 

A solid recommend from me to try it out, if you are tired of the typical chicken shawarma flavours or if you just want some really good food. This place is pretty close to my house so I've actually been going here very often that I've pretty much lost count. For the great food and consistency, solid 5 stars!

Server/Staff: Personable and polite
Clean: Yes
Service: 5-10 minutes tops"}
{"text":"I ordered a beef/lamb doner, and a chicken doner sandwich to go.  Freakin huge!  Freakin cheap!  Freakin delicious!

The sauces are made in house.  The meat is nice and juicy, and well seasoned.  The hot sauce is not too spicy, but it was tasty.  Garlic and hummus were both awesome.

I got there at 12:30pm on a weekend and it was really quiet.  I'm almost saddened, cause they stationed themselves in a Chinese plaza where there isn't too many people looking for non asian foods.  I talked to the father and the son a bit, and they're some friendly folks.  

If you're looking for takeout, and want good bang for the buck, hit this joint up.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident and thought I would check it out. It wasn't what I expected but it was soooo much better. The meat was tasty and juicy and the bread was light and soft. The service was excellent as well. Will definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
