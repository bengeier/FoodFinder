{"text":"Best ice cream in town!!! They always have new and unique flavors every time I stop in. The staff is very friendly and let you try as many flavors as you want! But the cookie cup is by far my favorite!  You choose a macaroon bottom as many scoops of delicious ice cream in the middle and another macaroon on top (I usually top mine with a toasted marshmallow) I highly recommend this ice cream shop!!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream! It's not like mind blowing but still really good. It was super cute how they presented it too. Extremely friendly and welcoming staff. Happy to support a local business that has such great people working there. I'll definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say is the ice cream here is awesome! I had the infamous cookie cup tonight with Cap'n Crunch Ice cream and it was delicious! The cookie was a delicious red velvet macaroon from a local bakery and it was so good! To top it all off they toasted a Marshmallow on top. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Love the fruity pebble ice cream and macaron. The marshmallow was gooey and perfect. And the lady was so nice!"}
{"text":"Located behind Mike's Bike Shop off Miller Rd a block off the bike path.  Startup by local guys with help by a lot of friends.  Unlike national chains, they can create seasonal flavors and special orders.  They just need a few innovative flavors and some promotion by word of mouth."}
{"text":"The marshmallow cookie Ice cream dessert is awesome. Everything tastes great and it has a nice atmosphere. My only issue was that rap and r&b do not work as the musical ambience. It was crowded on my visit and it was noticeable hearing suggestive lyrics how it affected the general tone and mood of the other guests. I would consider matching the tone of the penguins and pink and green with a radio choice, perhaps local radio of some sort that is more broad."}
{"text":"A good place to stop anytime for a cool, sweet treat on one of the warm or simmering days in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I ordered the Cookie Daddy - your choice of ice cream and macaroon topped w/ melted marshmellow.  I chose salted caramel ice cream and vanilla macaroon.  Nice touches of sweet, salty,  warm and cool.  So delicious!    You can sample the various ice cream flavors before making a decision and the staff was very friendly and patient. Both bonuses. Stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"Unique gourmet hand crafted ice cream flavors, great service, and a cool vibe.  Stopped in here after a bike ride to replace all of the calories I had just burned off, I got a scoop of the Urkel (extra points for the Family Matters reference!) which was a combination of chocolately goodness and peanut butter awesomeness in my mouth. My BF and partner in crime grabbed a scoop of the Netflix and Chill (subtle hint for what he wanted to do for the rest of the day? I think so.) His selection was also delicious. It was vanilla ice cream infused with popcorn and also had peanuts and other movie goodness mixed in.    As an added bonus, the patio is dog friendly.  The owner was very friendly and personable. I will definitely be returning to support this local business and to explore his other delicious creations."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Fatty Daddy has unique ice cream flavors and all of them are tasty! Many of their flavors have cereal in them. I got a cookie cup with red velvet cookies and honey smack and peanut butter ice cream. It also came with a roasted marshmallow on top that was warm and gooey. My husband got mint and chip and peanut butter ice cream on a sugar come and it was good, but he regretted not getting the cookie cup after trying some of mine. They are new and a little hard to find at night. They don't have any lighted signs but his is because of the strict city rules. They had friendly service and the owner even came out to talk to us for a bit."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment, just what I wanted, a homey establishment with Italiana nonna approved gelato. Break your diet and get the torched marshmallow, I asked Lana, the sweet lady that holds power of the mighty torch to burnt it a little well done, she obliged and the result is F`a`n`t`a`s`t`i`c`a`l`."}
{"text":"Holy cow... what a treat! Hidden behind Church's and Bob's Bikes. I love good ice cream. I heard from two separate people who know my weakness told me I had to try this new place. I was not disappointed.  The cup is layers of cookies and ice cream.  A slice of heaven. A must try!"}
{"text":"Great and unique concept! This place is worth trying but I thought the flavors of the ice creams and macarons were just OK. Overall though, A for effort. Lots of potential"}
{"text":"Wife and I just stopped by. Awesome food, great price and friendly staff.... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Upon entry they tried to sell their signature dish which for $2.50 more than a single scoop got you a small cookie and a bite of cooked marshmallow.  No thanks.  Ordered a single scoop and it was about two bites worth.  Probably the smallest \"single\" I have ever seen.  Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but The word needs to be spread about how amazing this place is!!! The absolute best ice cream shop in AZ, closest place to \"Milk N Honey\" in Canton, Ohio (regarded by myself and the travel channel to be the best in the US)that I've had on the west coast!!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream! They have a variety of such unique flavors (the flavor names are sure to make you laugh, too), and endless combinations, especially with their cookie cup option. My personal favorite might be the \"mangoneada,\" but I almost always end up picking something else because they all taste so good! I love that the decor is fresh and inviting, and they're open pretty late with friendly service, so that's a plus! All in all, it's a great place to satisfy my sweet tooth craving! I'll definitely be back in for more!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and service! We really enjoyed coming here during our visit to Scottsdale. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has changed and the portions are much much smaller. Instead of getting a a top and bottom to the macaroon cookie in the cookie cups, you get one on top of the very very small single scoop of ice cream with a toasted marshmallow. This is completely not worth $6.95. Also the single scoop is the smallest single scoop I have ever gotten. I would recommend Melt over this place any day."}
{"text":"Cute little place tucked away in a small strip mall. Delicious ice cream and macaroons! Loved the \"Netflix and chill\" flavor. Definitely a new go-to place for a yummy dessert."}
{"text":"Great friendly house made ice cream shop, great ice cream and toppings selections topped off with amazing customer service...can't beat this place"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, it's a small ice cream shop and the decor is so cute. The employees are very nice and welcoming. i enjoyed the \"mangoneada\" ice cream after sampling almost everything. It was really good!"}
{"text":"I just love how cozy and different this place is. They have the most inventive and unique combo's too. I love this please, especially in this Arizona heat . I will be back. Thank you ."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for a business meeting some coworkers and I decided to stop in for some ice cream and to try the Fatty Daddy. The ice cream flavors were far from ordinary. I ordered the sweet vanilla which sounds boring but tasted almost like mascarpone (delicious!). My co-workers got the Fatty Daddy where you get almost 3 scoops of ice cream and 2 macaroons topped with a toasted marshmallow. The employees were very friendly and cheerful even when we asked to get a taste of almost every flavor :) My team is returning to Phoenix in December so we'll have to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Very cool little ice cream shop. They have some great flavors and some pretty creative ones like Captain Crunch or Netflix and Chill (popcorn flavor). Their signature Fatty Daddy was awesome. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is their Fatty Daddy is a bit on the pricey side at over $30 for 4 people for their mini version."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot on Miller road. Clean with excellent service and delicious ice cream. Try the Fatty Daddy special with toasted marshmallow on top."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a co-worker. I debated on making the hour long drive from Surprise, but I am so glad I did! As someone who LOVES ice cream, this place is a must! The service was great and all the employees were very friendly. I got the cookie cup (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!) With captain crunch ice cream and red velvet macaroons. It was amazing and hit the spot. I will definitely be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"$3.95 for about two bites of ice cream. WAY OVER PRICED.  And it's $6.95 if you want a little cookie on top. Keep driving. Too little for too much $."}
{"text":"Not a big dessert person, but the macaroon sandwiches are quite good. I only tried the rich flavors, but they all seemed very good. The cereal flavors are good as well, but they contain actual pieces of cereal that are a little soggy. I didn't mind, but my friends did not like the texture. You also get marshmallow, but I felt it didn't really fit in.   This is a small store, so don't expect seating during the busy hours. You just might have to eat it outside or in the comfort of your car. The people working there are also very nice and patient. When I went, my group was just tasting flavors for a couple of minutes.   I would give these guys a higher rating, but the pricing is a little too high for a couple scoops and a macaroon."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic ice cream! It's great to get such a great and authentic small business here in south Scottsdale. Loved the Almost Famous Cookie Sundae with the peanut butter and chocolate/Nutella ice cream and the coconut macaron cookie. My friend loved her Girl Scout Thin Mint ice cream too."}
{"text":"Please tell me they have a cot in the back room so I can move in. Amazing ice cream. You have to get the cookie cup or you will regret it for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"Iced coffee was not good at all. Yelp says free wifi, the cashier said the wifi is not for customers. The ice cream in the displayed looked good at least. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! I was amazed! Definitely will go again when in the area. The macaroons were a perfect compliment to good solid icecream. Had the strawberry cheesecake icrecream, along with the peanut butter icecream and the almond macaroons topped with a guey marshmallow. Speechless. So tasty."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after looking at the reviews, but especially after the pictures. After I got my order, I was not impressed. I ordered an affogato and it was good, but definitely not worth the price or hype. Others in my group ordered the gelato and were not pleased as well. For that price, I would rather go to a Coldstones or Creamistry. I must've had high expectations for this place and may be the reason why the disappointment was monumental."}
{"text":"All can say is this place is legit and the staff are as friendly as they come. Good job Fat Daddy's"}
{"text":"This is the first time we've stopped in at Fatty Daddy's but based on the reviews and pictures, we were intrigued. The dessert with cookie and toasted marshmallow was the only \"special\" dessert item. They were out of most flavors and the one they had that we thought looked good was not. Chocolate Nutella was disappointing to the point that my wife and I threw it away. It's saying something if my wife throws away ice cream. We stopped at a gas station for a pint of Ben and Jerry's. It was much better.  Again, though, our only time there and it was late. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The mango ice cream is phenomenal. We got great suggestions of ice cream pairings from the gal over the counter. It is a gelato/sorbet joint, so a lot of fresh flavors.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time coming here and it was great! The people working the counter were very friendly and very willing to help you figure out what you might like. Also the ice cream flavors are crazy. I've never seen them before but they were awesome. They atmosphere was very cool as well with all the bright colors and the paintings on the wall. I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Not possibly real ice cream. Had texture of vegetable oil. I do not understand why there are so many great reviews. I sampled six flavors and each had a mealy oily texture. Went with strawberry cheesecake because i thought how can u mess that one up. Nope..same horrible texture."}
{"text":"Quick service, clean, and amazing ice cream and macarons. The cookie cup is a must have when visiting here. The ice cream, macaron, and toasted marshmallow is really a combination like no other. Each ingredient complimented the other. Already wanting to go back."}
{"text":"Yes, I echo what everyone else has said: the cookie cup is amazing and the customer service is excellent.   But I must also give props to some of their ice cream flavors. The cookies and cream is possibly the best version of that flavor that I've ever had. It's incredible. I get it every time. I also really like the chocolate birthday cake and the blueberry. I'm not as into the cereal flavors (too sweet), but let this be a reminder that they have some incredible other options!"}
{"text":"Never been here. Very low key shop in a very hidden area which makes it more special. I ordered the cookie cup and it comes with a scoop of your choice of ice cream , topped with a macaroon and still topped off with a super gooey hand torched marshmallow. Super good. Ill be coming back"}
{"text":"Cookie cup was amazing. I am not a big ice cream fan but this was so good I polished off the whole thing. Will definitely go back again. Place is kinda out of the way so tell all your friends about it, I hope this place is around for the next 50 years. Gentleman running it was so nice allowing you to sample the ice cream flavors before ordering."}
{"text":"Supporting a local business has never been more enjoyable!  Neat place, friendly owners and staff, deliciously unique ice cream. They offer macarons that go really well with the ice cream concoctions too.  FAVE -- Mangoneada with Chamoy.  TIP -- They do run out of the macarons. Delivery is on Thursdays so stop by on a Thu or Fri to be certain that they have them for you."}
{"text":"Get the cookie cup. The flavors here are amazing, captain crunch, fruity pebbles, Nutella, etc. get a coffee here too. Whatever you do just come here and support this small local business for some delicious stuff. Be patient, one ice cream person and they do take care of their customers. This is better than other creative ice cream places and rivals those where you wait in line in Portland or Seattle."}
{"text":"I had to stop by and try it myself... It's all true! This place is full of wonders. From the great customer service to the delicious treats. Even the awesome art and cute set up. We had two of the cookie cups-- Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream with vanilla cookie and the Netflix and Chill with coconut cookie. The cookies were delicious and the ice cream just made me smile.... (Writing this makes me want more!) My favorite part was the friendly service--- happy to let you try flavors and recommendations. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The thought of ice cream in Scottsdale is pretty obvious. We found this little place using Yelp and we had a good experience. No one was there when we arrived and it was just a bit hard to find. You go on Miller Road but the strip mall faces the side street which is like an access road.  Fatty Daddy's has 2 scoops of ice cream with one macaroon cookie on the bottom and one on top. Also has a toasted marshmallow on top. It's a good size to split with two people unless your really into your ice cream!  We had the Lucky Charms and the Urkel which is chocolate and peanut butter. Both were served in a small cup and the macaroon topping it. The marshmallow is scorched with one of those butane torches and it is a nice finishing touch."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out today and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy my mini fat daddy was  ;)   And the 2 gentlemen working were very friendly. I will definitely be back returning!"}
{"text":"First time I had Fatty Daddy's I only tried the captain crunch flavor ice cream. Based on that experience I would have only give about 3 stars -- its really just meh, to be honest.  Today, however, I got one of their cookie cups and holy cow those are amazing. I had mine with a scoop of hazelnut chocolate and a scoop of peanut butter ice cream topped with a coconut macaroon and toasted marshmallow on top.  They use one of those kitchen blow torches to toast the marshmallow and it was really good, tasted just like a marshmallow toasted over a camp fire.   I have found a new favorite dessert!  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service with great flavors. I do non-dairy so only had 2 flavors to choose from but they were both delicious and fresh. The ice cream-istas were incredibly nice and attentive. Even offered to store our cup to go for a friend while we dined in. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The cookie cup with the toasted mallow go perfectly together with their ice cream."}
{"text":"Overrated and too expensive for what it is.  The only thing I enjoyed was the toasted marshmallow and the macaroon.  The ice cream was bland and not that creamy.  I tasted a number of different options that all tasted like bland soggy cereal.  Staff was very patient with me during the tasting."}
{"text":"Eclectic gelato shop offering freshly toasted marshmallows on your ice cream cups. I got a small scoop of Nutella topped with a marshmallow. The gelato was bland- I couldn't taste any chocolate or hazelnut flavors. The marshmallow was sweet and gave some flavor to the otherwise tasteless gelato.  There was only one young guy behind the counter. He was doing his best by remaining calm and pleasant as the line grew out the door."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find, it's tucked behind church's chicken. I had the captain crunch ice cream (2 scoops) with the strawberry macaroon and a melted marshmallow on top. This isn't your typical ice cream spot and I'm so thankful for that. The flavors all complemented each other pretty well and the marshmallow maintained its gooey texture throughout my snacking . Great spot, my sweet tooth is satisfied."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ice cream; some cool flavors and some traditional favorites.  I got the fruity pebbles with fruity pebbles sprinkled on them and my friend got the sweet vanilla with a red velvet macaroon w/ a toasted marshmallow.  She enjoyed it very much; its called a cookie cup(I think).  Its $6.50 which I think is a bit high.   The place itself has some really pretty art work in it; really gorgeous paintings.   The only complaint I have about the place is the cups they put the ice cream in when they serve it.  They are too small.  I got a small, which was about 2.5 scoops of ice cream, and the cup was way too small.  If you get toppings, the toppings fall to the ground b/c there isn't enough room to fall in the cup.  You could never put caramel or hot fudge etc. on one of these as the toppings would go all over your hands and make a huge mess.  Other than that; all good."}
{"text":"Place is a great new addition to the area.  Flavors are inventive and unique.  Definitely need to get a fatty daddy,  two gigantic macaroons sandwich incredibly delectable hand crafted ice cream. Check email out."}
{"text":"Positive, they let you sample as many flavors as you want. The almost famous cup was good but if you have tried the ice cream and macaron sandwhich at pho43 they dont compare. No marshmellow there but the quality of the macaron is much better. This place is not worth going out of your way for but its still decent. If I didnt have something better to compare it to I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! This place is soooo good.  You get to pick your ice cream, choose a macaroon flavor and it's then topped with a melted marshmallow!! I got coconut ice cream with an almond macaroon and it was sooooo good. The macaroons are sooooo good!! My brother got cheer swirl ice cream with a strawberry macaroon and he also really liked his. This was my first time here and the owner was also super sweet! I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrific. My sister had seen them on social media and so we thought we would give it a try. As soon as we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the friendly workers who were more than willing to answer my never ending questions. They were eager to let us try as many flavors as we wanted and they were super helpful in making the final ice cream decision. I would most definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an ice cream lover!"}
{"text":"What a great place!! Such delicious ice cream and who doesn't love Pinguins! Huge shame the location is so utterly hidden. Cool artwork as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"You have to try the cookie cup!  Ice cream selection is small but very tasty.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  The whole place is very clean and bright, great atmosphere to sit and enjoy your treat.   A bit of advice for first timers coming here:  It can be difficult to find.  It is in the small building on Miller directly north of the Church's chicken.  Fatty Daddy's is on the north side of the building, turn in where you see the barbershop/tattoo parlor."}
{"text":"Delectable range of flavors that are as fun to dream about (I'm looking at you, 'Netflix & Chill') as they are delicious. I'm fearful of how dangerously close it is to my house and that I'll soon become Fatty Daddy's lesser-known cousin, Roly-Poly Kristy. ;)  Fun and friendly team-will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, the people serving the ice cream were fun, the art was interesting and the music was good. Now, not so much. It seems like the ownership changed because none of the people that I recognize are working any more and the vibe is a little different. Luckily that doesn't affect the ice cream. However, I've noticed the portions are a little bit smaller than what they previously were for the same price. The cashier didn't know the difference between a dozen and half a dozen macarons which ended up in a very long and awkward exchange when trying to figure out why we were overcharged.   Outside of that ice cream is still good and they offer plenty of flavors you will only find there. The macarons are baked fresh and taste delicious. The melted marshmallow on top offers a really yummy extra flavor. If you're looking for a late night unique snack and live in the area then this place if perfect."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We tried the cookie cup and it was more than we expected. We chose banana and mascarpone ice cream with a red velvet macaron. It was delicious."}
{"text":"We used to come here weekly and LOVED it!!!! Seems there's been quite a change since the last time we were here a few months ago. Love the new Affogato addition, that was delicious, HOWEVER - the scoops are WAYYYY TOO SMALL!!!!!!!! In the Fatty Daddy cup, you used to get a macaroon on the bottom, 2 good scoops of ice cream on top of that, another macaroon, another scoop of ice cream, topped with a large toasted marshmallow. Now you get 2 SMALL scoops of ice cream with a macaroon on top and the marshmallow is $1 more!!!!! GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY!!!!! I didn't even get the new Fatty Daddy cup because it's a complete rip off compared to what you used to get. The new Fatty Daddy cup will never be a \"famous\" cookie cup. Please go back to the old way and make your prices more reasonable!!!! It's quite a drive for us to visit Fatty Daddy's now, and the changes were very disappointing. Like I said, Affogato was delicious, ice cream flavors were yummy (maybe offer LESS cereal flavors), but the new portions and prices are EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good! I had a mangoneada and it was a nice combo of sweet and spicy. My big negative is the prices. I think they are just too high for an ice cream place. $5 for two scoops? Sheesh. I honestly don't think I'll return and that's unfortunate because their cookie cup looks good."}
{"text":"I love fatty daddy's! They have several gluten free options too!! The cookie cup is really flavorful. There are plenty of options to change it up each time. My one problem is there's only one person working at a time so if you come at a time when it's busy be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We got the Fatty Daddy--it was VERY tasty, but it was like our 3rd choice.   I made the mistake of falling in love with some of the flavors and macaron combinations I saw on Yelp and Instagram, and almost every kind I wanted was out of stock. Such a letdown! We ended up picking something my husband and I could agree on since we made the trip out there, but I wasn't in love with it. The woman working there was kind enough to offer samples and apologized for not having the kinds we wanted in stock (totally understandable), but it's hard to justify anything above 3 stars due to the limited choices we had relatively early in the afternoon on a week day."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to heaven! Homemade ice cream in between homemade macaroons with a homemade marshmallow brule'd on top! Only downfall: TOO HARD to find! almost gave up and got a bit cranky looking for it. If they'd fix their signage, this review would have been 5 star!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Get the cookie cup or you're not doing it right. The owner is awesome a,d flavors change at least once a week. All employees friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, try the mango habanero ice cream!   This has to be the best ice cream shop I've been to in my entire life! Yes, that's a bold statement from a frequent traveler!   As someone with a serious sweet tooth, I've done my homework prior to our move to AZ! I came prepared with an album full of ice cream shops to try and this happened to be at the top of my list(fortunately).  After reading many reviews, I came prepared to order a cookie cup. The cookie cup is one scoop topped with a macaron and a roasted marshmallow! I ordered the mango habanero cookie up and it was delicious! It had the perfect amount of kick to balance the sweetness.  The cookie cups are roughly $6 but the regular scoops are only around 3-4.   There are many flavors to choose from and it's all homemade!  We'll be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"The cookie cup was delicious! Two scoops of Gelato with a homemade toasted marshmallow on top of an almond macaroon! The service was excellent as well, we were welcomed by friendly staff. Great place for a sweet treat, we will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Very good ice cream, however the scoops are extremely small for a $3.95 single.  They are probably half to a third of what I would expect in a single serve and the ones we received are not even close to what is shown in the photo gallery."}
{"text":"I think I'm in the minority by rating this place 3-stars. I also feel like my friends will disown me once they find out because somehow it's becoming a tradition for them to go to Ahi Poke Bowl and then Fatty Daddy's. Don't ask - I'm not sure how it happened.  Anyway back to Fatty Daddy's! I've come here twice, and I feel like these are the moments when I wish a .5 star was possible. Yes, the fatty daddy cup ($9!!) has all the wonderful ingredients (up to two flavors of ice cream, two layers of macarons, and one toasted marshmallow) ...but in my opinion, the toasted marshmallow makes it hard to eat. Also, the macaron was a little crispier/harder the first time I went. However, it had the chewy consistency the second time. As far as the ice cream itself...I'm not a fan of all the cereal ones they have. With the cereal pieces in the ice cream, they seem stale/soggy when it's in my cup. I don't know. It just doesn't quite work for me.   Pluses of this place are the customer service and the loyalty points system. The guys and gal (I've only seen one so far) are always super friendly. You can try as many flavors as you want. They also have a loyalty program - for better or for worse - where you can earn scoops to a cup depending on how many points you have at your chosen time of redemption. So that's pretty nifty. These aspects are ones that makes me feel like this place is more of a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love fruity flavored ice cream and this place just hits the spot with just that! That torched marshmallow tho is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cookie cup with blueberry muffin ice cream, a fruity pebble macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top! Was so freaking good, wish I took a photo of all the crazy delicious flavors they had to offer, wish I could've tried them all too highly recommend Fatty Daddys!!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night and walked in with a crowd shortly behind us. My boyfriend got just a scoop of the 'Netflix and chill' flavor and honestly, it was not very good!   HOWEVER, I am a smart girl, so I went for the cookie cup. I chose the captain crunch ice cream and a red velvet macaroon. It was SO good. My boyfriend ended up throwing his out and we shared the Cookie cup. He was not disappointed with my choice.   Would definitely recommend popping in here. Try your flavor a first, make sure it's the right one for you."}
{"text":"Great dessert!  Definitely recommend getting their macaron with ice cream and toasted marshmallow. The toasting of the marshmallow was wonderful and I felt that the dessert actually wasn't too sweet. Also, ice cream quality was really great and creamy."}
{"text":"Bomb AF.  Try a milkshake with vanilla bean, mocha java, and white chocolate raspberry ice creams!!"}
{"text":"Found this mom n pop ice cream shop down the street from a house I rented on vacation.  This place is a hidden gem. Unique flavors of gelato.  The place is hard to find and we happened upon it. Well worth stopping for."}
{"text":"There is nothing more that needs to be said about delicious ice cream with solid macarons and a personally-crisped marshmallow on top. Too delicious.  My only complaint is that the parking lot could use some lights. This place is that good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ice cream shop I've been to! They have tons of unique ice cream flavors, soft macarons and top off your creation with a toasted marshmallow. The guy who helped us out (I forgot to get his name) was super friendly and more than happy to let us try any flavor we wanted. My husband and I will definitely be making this our regular dessert place."}
{"text":"This place was a nice gem of ice cream shops. Danny called this place unique and would recommend this shop to others. He ordered a vanilla scoop ice cream with a fruity pebble macaroon with a toasted marshmallow on top. I ordered a half school of mint chip with hazelnut chocolate, topped with a vanilla macaroon and a toasted marshmallow. I have to admit that the toasted marshmallow was so cool! I didn't realize how much of an addition it was until we tried it. It was fun and I would recommend this place to try at least once! There was plenty of seating and the service was nice."}
{"text":"Fat Daddy's is what South Scottsdale was lacking for years! Dairy Queen not being real ice cream was all to be found until....FDIC came into town to smash them down! The milkshakes here are super good! The Fat Daddy single is awesome. You get to pick your macaroon flavor too to go with your ice cream. The seating area is small so best to go earlier than later. Great place to pop into though for a sweet those with a sweet tooth then head home and enjoy with a good movie!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great ice cream!!! They even have cereal flavors and those are BOMB if you love cereal !! Paco has a great personality and made our experience great! Super nice and great service ! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"SO INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS. Captain Crunch ice cream and the Fruity Pebbles macarons... RUN, don't walk!!! The workers are also extremely friendly and helpful. I came with a group of 10 and we were served quickly! Seriously every flavor of ice cream was unbelievable like"}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper came across this local ice cream shop while browsing Yelp and we ddciced to go all out despite a very heart dinner elsewhere.  The shop is tucked away in the back of a building. As we walked in were immediately greeted by two enthusiastic and outgoing employees.  They offered free samples to and suggestion based off our flavor preferences.  Went with the \"Mini Daddy\"  size to help keep my trim and slim bikini body (not really but we'll go with that).  Got hooked up with the \"Netflix&Chill\" a coconut cookie and topped with a roasted marshmallow.  Even with my ready to burst stomach I was ready for more after a few bites.  Cleaned that bowl so well it was sparkling and could've been re-used. All this for someone who doesn't neccesarily care for dessert. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is a small joint and the ice cream is absolutely delicious! The place is a little hidden and he parking lot is small so I could imagine how busy it would be during the summer. The ice cream creation with the macaroon and roasted marshmallow is genius!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely different. The location was a little far from most of Main Street. The atmosphere was average but there was a fair amount of seating for an ice cream shop. There was unique artwork, 'wall flair', that a person could purchase. The ice cream flavors were largely varied but the quality was average. The macaron cookie was great and the homemade marshmallow on top was a unique contribution to the 'Fatty Daddy' combo."}
{"text":"I would not call this place a \"hole-in-the-wall\".  They are in a hard to find location though. Their flavors hit your taste buds with full force.  A charming setup, in my opinion.  Go try it, you will not regret it...or maybe you will because you will want to go often!"}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed in this place. The gelato flavors were not unique and the texture was more on the watery side. I was hoping for a nice creamy texture but nope not here. I got the cookie cup of course because why not since that's what they are known for. Thought it was a little on the pricier side and the marshmallow was way too salty... did not expect that at all. So if you're not the type that likes sweet and salty, you're in for a huge shock like me.   Pros: + you'll get a nice picture for instagram + the macaroon cookie was nice and chewy  Cons: -parking was not the best -expensive  - SALTY"}
{"text":"Omg....if you like ice cream this place is a must. Read the about us on the website...fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you are even close to Scottsdale you have to pop in & try this place!! Enjoyed the gelato & iced coffee, both delicious."}
{"text":"Very small portions of ice cream for the 9$ I spent.  Cereal was very soggy in the ice cream so idk it's a good idea but don't turn out too good. I'll stick to cold stone"}
{"text":"Wow. Just amazing! I've been dying to try this place since EVERYBODY keeps talking about it. All the hype is REAL! The service was amazing! Franciso helped us pick ( we were very indecisive go figure ) but he was patient and answered any questions needed.  A variety of different flavors and your choice of macaroon followed by a toasted marshmallow - I swear I was in heaven!  I love it! And I will be back - that's a promise :)"}
{"text":"The struggle between keeping your new favorite dessert place a secret and posting a 5-star review on Yelp that it deserves! I choose the 5-star review! There have been so many photos of the cookie cup from Fatty Daddy's floating around Yelp, Instagram, & Facebook that I had to go in to try one as soon as possible.  First and foremost, their ice-cream! When we were there, we were told that they invent their own flavors and work with a local dairy to bring all their creations to life. This is why they have unique flavors like fruit loops, cap n crunch, blueberry muffin, Netflix & chill (popcorn flavored infused ice-cream with a bunch of stuff it), etc.  Next, the cookie cup! To make one, they take up to two ice-cream flavors of your choice and make a sandwich with a macaron. The flavors of the macarons vary but the time we went they had fruity pebbles, red velvet, and vanilla. They also toast up a marshmallow right in front of you and add any toppings to the cup that you may want!  My order was for a fruity pebbles macaron with blueberry muffin ice-cream and a toasted marshmallow. The best part about this whole dessert was that everything was put together in layers so there were bits of all three parts in every bite! The macaron was soft and chewy with a smooth outer shell, the blueberry muffin ice-cream was packed with delicious blueberry flavor, and the toasted marshmallow added another unique layer of flavor with a gooey texture. Yum!!  Lastly, the service was spot on! We were welcomed in right when we walked in and offered samples of ice-cream. They were great in making recommendations and were happy to give us the time we needed to make a decision even as it was getting busy. I can't wait for the next time to get another cookie cup!"}
{"text":"for having their ice cream and bakery items outsourced the prices are a little high. It would be better if they made everything on site and it would affect their taste and increase their value.  The flavors of the gelatos are decent and customer service was good."}
{"text":"If you love amazing and one-of-a-kind flavors of ice cream, and if you also love amazing macarons, then you will absolutely LOVE this place. Just do yourself a favor and get the cookie cup...you will be in sugar heaven. All 3 owners are incredibly cool too...so head on in there and go treat yourself to one of the tastiest treats in the Valley. You will have no regrets, I promise you this my friends :) oh yeah, and there's a homemade toasted marshmallow to top it all off. Drops the mic and walks away."}
{"text":"Really good ice cream!! Is definitely a must have with the almost famous cookie cookie bowl!"}
{"text":"An odd location, but if you're going to drive to get ice cream anyway... I appreciate the non-standard flavors.  I tried Cinnamon Toast Crunch which needed some help, not cinnamon-y enough.  And tried the Cap'n Crunch which was well done and surprising.  As you see, I went with two cereal flavors.  I tried the nutella, but it was a bit too bland, so went with the above.  The ice cream is good.  A very smooth texture and sweet.  I didn't not try the sundae with a macarone and marshmallow (not hungry enough). Definitely worth trying, but I felt the flavors needed to \"pop\" a little more (and realize I'm comparing this to the best ice cream I've had in this country)."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for ice cream and drinks! It's on the corner of McDowell and Miller. It's better to park behind the building and then walk.   I loved my salted caramel ice cream! Delicious and not too sweet! Then it was topped with a red velvet macaroon and a toasted marshmallow. I felt that macaroon was too big to be an actual macaroon and didn't taste like a genuine red velvet flavor. I would love to go back and get only the ice cream with a macaroon. So it was good but i would order a different macaroon!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Unique, deliciousness!! A bit pricey, but definitely a yummy treat!! It cost us almost $20 for 2 simply because my boyfriend added a couple of toppings."}
{"text":"I was craving ice cream and wanted to share a sundae with my bf before seeing a comedy show at stand-up Scottsdale, and after seeing sugar bowl packed with line out the door, I looked up places for ice cream and found this place. I asked if they are able to make a sundae but then I found out about their famous \"cookie cup\" which is either a vanilla (got it, very sweet and delicious), red velvet or something else which I can't remember macaroon cookie layered with two scoops of an ice cream flavor of your choice, topped with another topping of your choice and another macaroon with a toasted marshmallow on top like a crown. it was big enough to share with my bf and one of the best ice cream treats I've ever had. I got it with vanilla macaroons and two scoops of cookie dough ice cream, rainbow sprinkles and caramel sauce. It was divine."}
{"text":"Ordered a cookie bowl, and you should too. I've been trying different ice cream spots around The Valley this summer, and the cookie bowl was a definite must-try. The marshmallow was good and a bit salty. The macaron was chewy rather than delicate, but I wasn't mad at it. The ice cream was tasty! Try it out."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Super Nice folks and their various cookie cup creations are just phenomenal.  I had mine with a Macaroon cookie, coconut ice cream, butter pecan, and the signature toasted marshmallow on top.  Was simply amazing.  My friend had one with A vanilla cookie, chocolate birthday cake ice cream, cookies and cream.  Hers was good, but mine was the bomb.  Great place, you must check it out."}
{"text":"Cute ice cream shop with a cute idea. The Fatty Daddy's \"almost famous\" cookie cup will sure be a hit soon on social media.  Best way to eat the cookie cup is all at once, dig your spoon into the gooey marshmallow into the crisp maroon into the creamy scoop of ice cream.    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think the most entertaining aspect of Fatty Daddy's is the people that work there! I've only been later in the evenings, which is awesome because they are open late! Their ice cream flavors are unique and not something you'll find at any other ice cream place. Their macaroons and toasted marshmallow are sometimes stale-tasting, which is why I didn't give a 5 star review. But they still taste good and it's just a fun experience when you're not in the mood for DQ or Dreyers. Lucky for them they are the only ice cream shop in the surrounding area. I hope they stay in business and do well because it really is a fun treat to eat! My hubsand LOVESSSS them and thinks they deserve at least seven stars..."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for Fatty Daddy's based on the reviews here.  The good: The fruity pebbles macaroon was nostalgia on my taste buds to the extreme. If I were to come back to this place, it would be for that frigging macaroon only. If you haven't tried this place, I'd say try it once to get a decent macaroon. Also I love that they place a fat marshmallow on top of the whole thing and toast it right in front of your eyes. Amazing.  The not so good: Unfortunately, despite the awesome toppings described above, the gelato was lacking. We're from Philadelphia so, FWIW, we know exceptional gelato. This was so lackluster. If I didn't order my own flavors, I honestly would not have known what flavors they were because they were so bland! And they weren't soft like gelato should be. It was weird, hard, flavorless ice cream.  I'd say if you haven't been here before, give it at least one try, but maybe keep searching for your dream local cold treat stop."}
{"text":"This review is more for the cookie cup. It's crazy expensive. I get it, but it's kinda small especially like someone else had said about comparing it to other photos here on yelp. Also, it's only one side of the macaron cookie so it should be less. I could've gotten a huge scoop at cold stone and would've been sooo much happier. The marshmallow is so salty. I don't even think I tasted any sweetness to it, just salt. We just took it off. So if you don't like salty sweet like me, don't get it. The lady working was nice and helpful and ice cream was pretty good but the marshmallow basically ruined this for me.  Side note, why the heck is a 16oz coffee $3.25?!? That's more than what Starbucks charges and this is no hipster specialized coffee brewing place, should not be that much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Get the Cookie Cup. Delicious ice cream sandwiched between 2 macaroons. Awesome!"}
{"text":"IM OBSESSED.   Dessert is my absolute favorite. In fact, I've been told I have \"sweet teeth\" as opposed to a sweet tooth. So when my boyfriend told me there's a new spot by his place that serves ice cream with macaroon cookies and a toasted marshmallow.....I was counting down until my next visit to Scottsdale.   Feeling the inner kiddy in me, I had the captain crunch ice cream with a fruity pebbles macaroon and was in sugary yummy heaven.   It's a little pricey (even by my LA standard). Think gelato prices. But I think it's worth it for the occasional treat.    Ps if you skip the toasted homemade marshmallow you're a devilish monster."}
{"text":"Fun place. My teeth feel like they were rotting because it was so sweet. Great service and flavors!"}
{"text":"... don't come here. they give you so little for what you pay for.. i got the affogatto and it looks and tastes like crap. she gives half a scoop of ice cream with a little scooper and a shot of espresso in a little cup. my friend got their famous cookie cup and it was not satisfying at all. she got one 1 side of a macaroon and very little ice cream... it added to one scoop of that little scooper she used... came at 9 on a monday night 2/27/17. PAID $5 for this!"}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix or Scottsdale it's not a bad drive but from Peoria it's 40 minutes at best. Small little mom and pop Place with a fantastic concept and really good treats!  The home made marshmallows are just unreal!!! Sooo good!  The staff is great and the ice cream is some of the best I have had. Will I be back ?  YES"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is amazing. Straight out of a Fairy Tale, basically a highly recommended delicious treat you will never regret!!!"}
{"text":"It was wonderful perfect ice cream perfect size perfect outdoor patio very friendly waitstaff I would definitely go back in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"First timers tonight and we will now choose Fatty Daddy's over any desert place. Staff were great and offered as many samples as we would like. Went over the menu with us and wasn't rushed at all even though there were people in line behind is. Quality service and quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good. It can be hard to find the location but it is very worth it. If you go, you definitely need to get the fatty daddy - ice cream, with a homemade macaron and marshmallow. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Liked the Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream - the cereal bits were nice and chewy. The chocolate was meh.  Good, but not great, ice cream."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the prices or quality of this semi new ice cream place. The lone asian women behind the counter was nice, but this shop immediately reminded me of one of those asian donut shops you see in every city. The donuts in those places are not usually good and the ice cream here was less than memorable as well. First off, make the size of the sundae bigger or lower the $6.50 price of that sundae. It's not even a sundae technically because it has no syrup. You get two small scoops of bad ice cream (i needed to try 5 flavors to find decent one), two stale macaroons and that \"famous\" toasted marshmallow. One person with me had a bad aftertaste for at least an hour after the nutella. My flavor was cinnamon toast crunch, which like many flavors, are just vanilla with cereal tossed inside. If your gonna overpay for ice cream, go to creamistry. BTW , If you go non sundae, prices are normal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Living 3 minutes away is dangerous! All the flavors they have are unique and taste amazing! Only thing is that it's kinda on the pricey side but well worth it :)"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for a night in Scottsdale while driving across the county and was craving some ice cream so I did a search on Yelp for ice cream and found this place and I couldn't not have picked a better place. The ice cream was amazing!!! I got the cookie cup which is a must for any first time visitor if your looking for quality ice cream don't go any where else but fatty daddy's you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love!! We ordered 2 Mini Daddy's and it was perfect!! Everything was fresh and delicious. Will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Netflix & Chill flavor and the coconut macaron. This is on the pricier side for ice cream, and hard to find since it's tucked away almost in an alley off Miller Road."}
{"text":"The kids here were extremely friendly and even encouraged us to try each flavor! What a nice change of service service opposed to the typical ice cream parlor attitude!! Ice Cream was good and is average price! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Gelato, macaron, waffle cup AND toasted marshmallow... what's not to love?! First time stopping here. Tasted a few gelatos before settling on black walnut maple. They were all pretty tasty. There was a little bit of a line but it moved quickly especially as there was just one guy working there. The spot is a little tucked away. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor selection. Ice cream excellent quality with excellent \"toasted\" marshmallow. Must try the cookie cup made with macaroons, unbelievable."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and luckily got the yelp discount!! We loved the gelato, the melted homemade marshmallow and macaroons. It is very low on pastries despite what was said online about it - except macaroons. The ice cream was amazing it was organic and had a nice light feeling to it. The workers were very friendly and my family and I had a very nice time chatting with one of them. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saw a bunch of my friends posting about Fatty Daddy's and had a late night craving for some ice cream so here I go. We got there right around closing time but service was still excellent and they let us sample some flavors. Originally wanted banana but after trying the lucky charms, we were hooked. Was recommended to pair it with a fruity pebbles macaron and I was in heaven. Ice cream had some unique flavors and was very rich and creamy. The macaron was also perfect not hard but still nice and chewy. Would love to go back and try some other flavors. They gave me a stamp card with some extra stamps on it so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and me and a friend decided t check it out on a Tuesday at 730pm! They were all so helpful and willing to let us try all the flavors.   Some of the flavors were kind of weird and disappointing such as \"Netflix and Chill\" but their cookies and cream was AMAZE BALLS! Also, they were out of macaroons so  couldn't try the cookie ice cream thing that they do. BUMMER!  Cool place though!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! They have a great combination of unique and original ice cream flavors. Everywhere from Cap N Crunch, Nutella and Froot Loops flavors to red velvet, raspberry sorbet and vanilla! I their famous cookie cup with banana and coconut ice cream with a coconut macaron. They also roasted a marshmallow on top of it right before they handed it to me! This place is as good as advertised!"}
{"text":"Make it a point to come here! I've been dreaming of marshmallows ever since and nothing lives up. We almost missed it as the building is tucked into a dimly lit business strip, but GPS didn't fail us. You get to select your ice cream flavor, macaroon flavor, and topping! You even can watch as your marshmallow is carefully bruleed before your eyes.   Did I mention that it's not just gorgeous, it's DELICIOUS?!   I have a banana obsession, so I went with banana iced cream, vanilla macaroon, caramel sauce, and certainly a marshmallow. It will be hard to order anything else!"}
{"text":"Perfect service! It's all about their worker Kimberly! Although it's 30 minutes till they closed, she gave recommendations as if it was her first customers of the day! She's amazing and offers us joy coming in! A must! Please come and support the business!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It doesn't look like much but their cookie cup provides four scoops of ice cream you can mix and match, two macaroons, and a melted marshmallow on top. It easily fills two people. And because of that I understand the pricing at $7.50.  I really loved the favors of ice cream and macaroon options. They have classic flavors as well as cereal flavors for both, like Fruity Pebbles, and Captain Crunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Busy on a Wednesday night. Macaroons for cookie cup are delivered on Thursday."}
{"text":"My first time here and I had to start with the mini daddy. It comes with a macaroon cookie (almond flour), a torched marshmellow and ice cream.  I tried 4 flavors and they were all good!  Some creative flavors here along with the classics.     Most importantly it has the one thing every ice cream pace needs-- water!  For after the ice cream of course.  Really like that detail."}
{"text":"You've never had ice cream until you've had a Cookie Cup, a Fatty Daddy's invention. I mean, listen to this: Ice cream, macaron, more ice cream ANOTHER MACARON, and then oh wait, a marshmallow? What? To top it off, they bring out FIRE to toast that thing?!?? My mouth had no clue what the heck was going on, but it wanted more of it.   Make sure you get in when they have macarons, but even if they don't, TRY EVERYTHING! It's a pleasant experience from start to finish. Brian is the nicest guy on the planet, Dom will make sure your experience is more than perfect, and David can think of a great combination of ice cream on the fly! From the moment you step into Fatty Daddy's, you'll be welcomed with a \"WELCOME TO FATTY DADDY'S!\"..from that moment on, you're family.   So let's recap: Try everything, get a cookie cup, and leave feeling like family. Sounds like a great experience. I know I had one and will be returning."}
{"text":"Love love this place. First time there but I'm already hooked. They have different options every day so you can never get tired of it! Hidden gem! Great art to make the environment super chill and artsy! Lots of flavor for you to choose as well as different flavor macaroons"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned ice cream shop. I took my parents and daughter. They had the Cookie Cup topped with macaroon toasted marshmallow. The ice cream were fresh."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Scottsdale. I love this local ice cream joint. Their staff is so friendly, gave me extra stamps on my punch card and the toasted marshmallow on top is such an added treat!"}
{"text":"I got a cookie cup for $6.50 plus paid an extra $1 for a toasted marshmallow.   Fatty Daddy pretty much has your standard flavors for ice cream and macarons; nothing too unique or exotic. For the ice cream, they were close to selling out of nutella; not enough to make a cup but I still sampled it and thought it was good.   They were sold out of the caramel macaron and I didn't want vanilla or strawberry. I'm not a fan of coconut and I know fruity pebbles is trendy, but I was never fan of it, either. My only option left was red velvet.   Salted caramel is usually one of my go-to's so I didn't even think about sampling it first. I thought it should go well with the red velvet macaron, so I went with it. Off course I had to add a toasted marshmallow for extra effect.   I liked the concept of the cookie cup and appreciate what they're trying to do. It was just way too sweet for me...and I have a huge sweet tooth. The salted caramel ice cream didn't even taste good. It was a disappointment, especially for how much it costs. I say if you're doing it for the 'gram, go for it, but don't expect to be blown away.   I do have to say though that the person there was very friendly and the other flavors we did try were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is definitely a different approach on classic ice cream shop. Instead of the classic \"baked bear\" ice cream sandwich or cold stone waffle cone, Fatty Daddy's delivers a melange if textures and tastes. Each component of my treat, had a different layer of creaminess! First, a cloud of roasted Smokey marshmallow that falls. Then comes a delicate silky macaroon. Lastly, a frosted hill of smooth ice cream. I asked the guy his favorite mix - Irish cream ice cream with a Carmel macaroon. We both got some and enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the cookie cup with chocolate gelato, a caramel cookie and roasted marshmallow on top ! Great gelato!!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was a big deal when it opened and it was such hype! Ill be honest I thought it was okay in my opinion. Lots of sugar involved and one bite is diabetes LOL. Broken down, its a macron ice cream sandwich with a toasted marshmallow on top! Definitely a great place to take a person who is a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream with a ton of unique flavor options. The place is incredibly clean and the employees are really helpful! Definitely recommend getting the macaroon and the toasted marshmallow option!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, this place sure does have a great idea.   Cereal ice cream!?? Cinnamon toast crunch ice cream, seriously!!! Amazing! What's any better than that...I'll tell u put in between fruity pebble macaroons! Yup a delicious ice cream cookie sandwhich.  So I had seen a bunch of posts about this place so clearly I needed to see what all the hype was about. I was actually pretty impressed with the ideas behinds the ice cream flavors. I had never seen ice cream flavor a derived from popular kid cereals. Cinnamon toast crunch, fruit loops and cap n crunch. Pretty Smart! They also had some other delicious flavors, I personally liked the white chocolate raspberry and mangoneada.   They are popular for their ice cream cookie/macaroon sandwhiches which they top off with a fire roasted marshmallow. They have a variety of macaroons that are made specifically for them.   The location was a bit hard to find since it is tucked away and not easily visible from the street. Unfortunately after speaking with one of the owners they are not really permitted many options as far as signage by the city because of the direction the store entrance faces and rarity of their actual retail spot. This can make it a bit difficult for some patrons but they are close to a park which will make them a popular summer spot once they get their name out more.   Definitely check them out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique dessert!    Don't blink or you might miss this place on the back side of a main road.  Glad we found it! I think if you go to this place and don't try the cookie cup you are really missing out.   They make their own ice cream and I found it to be very creamy and excellent flavor.  I had the Captain Crunch and the Salted Caramel.  Both were great - but my favorite was the captain.  Yum!  I opted for a vanilla macaroon to pair with my toasty marshmallow-y sundae goodness.  The marshmallows are also homemade.  It's real good.  The inside has a few tables - not a lot of ambiance but we're just here for the ice cream.  Am I right?   The girl at the counter was super helpful and let us try whatever we wanted.  She asked where we were from and made some fun suggestions for our visit. Really cool.  We will totally be back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"A lot of great flavors to choose from and the staff is more than happy to let you try as many as you'd like. The location isn't the greatest, but there is a fair amount of parking.  I went with the Cookie Cup (red velvet macarons, Cap'n crunch and cookies & cream ice creams). This thing is beastly.  Would highly recommend and will defintely be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Waft of ice cream, sweets hits you immediately when you open the door.  Great start.  Mint chocolate chip was excellent and they had plenty of sorbet options for my vegan friend.  Totally hit the spot"}
{"text":"Lovely place, great customer service!  Yummy ice cream ( we tried Nutella, Vanilla, and Coffee flavors) with choices of toppings and best with macaron and burnt marshmallow!!"}
{"text":"Wishing this was a fivestar-er, but man we're bummed.   It was hard to find this place at night, no illuminated signage. Once we found it, we were pumped and the girl who welcomed us in was nice.   Unfortunately, although we were the only people there... And the only people in the parking lot.. Repeating myself here this joint was not busy, pretty much everything we came for was sold out.   The marshmallow you see in every picture on Yelp? Sold Out. What bothers me about that? How do you run out of your signature item, especially when it's (I'm assuming here) not homemade. Go to the grocery store, buy mallows. Problem solved. Same with the red velvet macaroons. I happened to order the last one, leaving my boyfriend to pick from the remaining flavors (Carmel was also sold out).   Ice cream flavors were good and the macaroon was tasty, but for $11+ dollars?! No. Especially with the inconvenience of ordering from a limited menu and the atmosphere being kinda meh. Just... No."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS but too expensive for what it was to get full stars.  I loved the options and I'm definitely happy I ordered the ice cream with the marshmallow and macaroon.  However, I feel like the macaroons aren't as great as other macaroons I've had and for the price, I think each component should be delicious on its own.  Again, I'm still super happy I tried this out and the marshmallow is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Minus 1 star. Service was crappy, and Ice cream was even worse. For $7.50 we got horrible ice cream with soggy cereal, an extremely salty (yes salty?!) marshmallow, and a below average thin half of a cookie. Would never recommend."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. The only reason why I gave a 3 stars is the price. I ordered a kiddy size $3.95, Half a macaron $1.50 (it looks full sized but it only has one cracker part), and a marshmallow $1. Thanks goodness it has a $10 yelp discount. The ice cream tastes good. The coconut mango is kind of too sour for my mom. I liked my coffee ice cream."}
{"text":"If I keep coming back to this place I'm going to turn into a Fatty Daddy!   I mean why didn't I think to put my macaroon on top of my ice and then top it with a marshmallow? It's genius and oh so tasty! There are plenty of yummy ice cream and macaroon flavors to choose from too! But, I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the combinations.   The lady behind the counter was very helpful my first time and gave some great recommendations!   This ice cream is a must after dinner dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. if you go.. it's worth spending the $6 on their 'almost famous' cookie cup. Specifically the cookie cup is your choice of a unique flavored ice cream ( I've done the 'netflix and chill which is popcorn, butter flavored sweet ice cream, chocolate pretzels) layered with a delicious, soft and chewy macaron cookie, topped with more ice cream, another macaron and then a marshmallow place don top which they toast right in front of you. We've also tried the delicious lucky charms ice cream and the amaretto ice cream. all have been AMAZING. The pictures really speak for themselves. Not though, the place is unassuming and hidden away in the corner of a parking lot by a paint store. My AppleMaps took me a bit to find the place, but the treasure at the end of it is delicious and worth it!  kudos!"}
{"text":"Cool idea behind it. Good flavor ice creams and sorbets. The red velvet macaroon was ok not that tasty but pretty. It would be nicer to add more flavors to the selection. They have a hidden location but their cool idea and quality drag people here with help of Yelp."}
{"text":"The perfect little ice cream shop! I got the mini cookie cup with Cinnamon Toast Crunch & chocolate - so good!!!"}
{"text":"Super fun place - location is just in a small strip mall but the staff is friendly and let you try various ice creams before buying. Get the cup with ice cream, macaroon and marshmallow. Pretty cool when they are making it and toast it. Awesome experience for young kids especially and super tasty ice cream. Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream and cherry swirl were so good!!! I don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is in such a strange location. It's next to a bike store and a paint supplier, with no other stores sharing the same parking lot. I imagine it would be hard to find at night since they don't have a sign on the building, the only indication being the words on the door, which can't really be seen until you're in the parking lot. Definitely pricey for what you're getting. One scoop of ice cream with one macaron half was about $6, would've been about $7 if I had the marshmallow. And that brings me to another point - they were out of marshmallows, which is strange to me since that's one of their signature things. They had also run out of several flavors of macarons including red velvet and caramel. I had the mini, but the original Fatty Daddy's cookie cup would probably come out to $9 or $10 with tax, which is pretty steep for a few scoops of ice cream. The one guy working was nice and told us about their specialty ice cream. I did like the decorations in the place. The ice cream was just decent, nothing really special, but the macaron was pretty good. I might come by again to try different flavors if they're available next time, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Dang this place is good. Go here, go here quick and try everything. Haha  The place is small but clean and cute with old looking vintage ice team parlor type chairs. They are friendly and helpful with explaining flavors and letting you try them.   The flavors themselves are interesting and the names are catchy. I had a flavor called netflix and chill ( hilarious). It was a slightly savory and sweet buttery flavor with m&ms, chocolate covered pretzels and a bunch if other delicious flavors. It was super creamy and amazing.   They have add ins as well as macarons  and amazing looking marshmallows that they can torch on too of your ice cream (genius).   I was able to buy a whole pint to take home and share with my hubby. I can't wait to go back and get more flavors!"}
{"text":"Gotta keep your eyes out for it as it's a very nondescript storefront. I did as everyone says and get the special. It's very tasty albeit not very satiating. The scoops were kind of small but the other toppings make up for it. Not much ambience to the place but the treats are worth the stop."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been here about 4 times in 2 weeks. Doesn't help that we took all the kids the first time and now the oldest literally asks every night if we can go back.  The flavors are amazing. The first night I had the white chocolate raspberry and the coffee flavor (I forget now what they call it exactly). They were terrific. The flavors are very strong and taste real. The coffee tasted like a terrific cup of coffee with cream and sugar. And the raspberry was a strong, natural taste, while the white chocolate did not over power the rest.  My husband had the watermelon sorbet and it tasted just like taking a fresh slice of watermelon out of the freezer.  The second time I had a homemade roasted marshmallow on top of my sundae and it was divine. The smell is a little intense at first with the burning sugar, but the flavor was terrific.   I would highly recommend seeking out this tiny gem. They have standard flavors as well as creative ones (my favorite name so far is the Netflix and Chill). I've met both owners and they really seem to enjoy what they do and the people they meet."}
{"text":"Super fun dessert place. If you want a unique and super sweet dessert then this is it! I got the cookie cup with hazelnut choc and cherry swirl ice cream, vanilla macaron and toasted marshmallow. Be warned: the cookie cup is smaller than the previous pictures on here. They must have changed the size so you only get one half of the macaron and 2 scoops of ice cream. The gelato is yummy!"}
{"text":"Definitely a unique experience! My friend and I got the cookie bowl, though it was delicious I wouldn't get it again. Was fun to try but a little much. I did loveee my Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream! Cute shop def worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Read all of the great reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a shot. The customer service was great which is always a positive. I ordered their \"almost famous\" which came with 2 scopes of ice cream, macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top. Overall everything was very good. I think they could experiment with having the macaroon's be fresh or a little softer so it wasn't like you were eating three different things. Also, maybe the possibility of mixing or crunching up the macaroon with the ice cream could be interesting."}
{"text":"After killing tacos & tequila @ the AZ taco festival we were craving something sweet & well I premeditated my attack plan on coming here afterwards. DID NOT disappoint. Customer service was great as I was able to try samples of Lmost everything without even asking & the (I forgot the name) but the Macaroon ice cream sandwich thingy with the marshmallow was"}
{"text":"The marshmallows were super super yummy! It melt on top of the ice cream. I tried the salted caramel, quite home made style. The shop is cute, bright color, perfect for chitchatting with friends. Very close to Scottsdale old town. Good to stop by after dinner and before going out for drinks in the old town.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fruity pebbles ice cream!!!!! You can't go wrong. Best ice cream in Scottsdale! Adorable inside seating area and the outside patio is cute and shaded. Lots of parking and the staff is so sweet."}
{"text":"Decent ice cream, good service, overpriced.  I was excited to try this place out after seeing the reviews. I love ice cream more than the average person. I tried several flavors, and they were decent. There were some interesting flavors, like fruity loops. You then have the option of adding toppings, including a macaroon or toasted marshmallow for extra $. I added a toasted marshmallow for mine and a macaroon for the lady. I chose the single scoop for both and it still ended up being just over $10. To be honest, the ice cream is just a notch above Baskin Robbins in my opinion. I can't see myself ever choosing this place over something like Cold Stone. It's just not worth the cost in my opinion. I know macaroons are always expensive, but that doesn't explain the expensive ice cream itself. On a scale of Breyer's to Tillamook, I give this a Dryers."}
{"text":"Was expecting more from Fatty Daddy's. Was O-K ice cream and the man working was extremely helpful, but we were not blown away. The ice cream that we got had a weird aftertaste and was not at the level of other similar places nearby. I don't think we will be back any time soon, but thanks for the friendliness and great service!"}
{"text":"We found Fatty Daddy because of their (smartly placed) ICE CREAM banner on the corner of Miller & Almeria. We checked the place out last night, which coincidently, was their grand opening. Even though they're not likely to have food trucks and a DJ on a regular night, we will be back. We had the Blueberry Muffin and Thin Mint ice cream flavors. Guess what they tasted like? Yup. Right on point, guys. Really, really luxe tasting ice cream base, too. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem. So glad I stopped by. Feels like a home town I've cream shop. Very clever yummy flavors too! Whiskey Irish cream, wow!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a place. So glad we found it!  The cookie cup was so delicious!!  Wish we had found this place earlier during our vacation. Very friendly people who run it too."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place forever and it did not dissapoint!!!  It's located in the back with a dirt lot which made it hard to find at first but I appreciate all the parking. We went inside and immediately we were greeted warmly and with excitement. They gave us a walk through about their flavors and some of their specialties.   I did the one scoop with toasted marshmallow and a macaron on top. First of all, I love smores, I love ice cream and I especially love MACARONS!!! This was a beautiful marriage of everything I loved in on concoction. It was original but a twist on the classic. The Urkel ice cream was my favorite because Peanut Butter and Chocolate just belong together!  The decor is awesome because the art is so unique. I mean, I think I need a giant picture of Urkel licking ice cream in my house now. The chairs were comfortable and I love the blend of colors. Overall, I love this place!! Such an awesome addition to Scottsdale that has it's own unique flair!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was amazing, captain crunch was our favorite. Only reason I gave four stars is because of the location and everything seemed outdated inside."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the different selection of ice cream. Awesome variety. Great service and great ice cream!"}
{"text":"Get the cookie cup! Very good. You get to pick a flavor of ice cream and macaroon and then a marshmallow is toasted on top.  I picked the chocolate hazelnut ice cream and then picked a strawberry macaroon. My niece got the coffee favored with red velvet macaroon and said it was excellent."}
{"text":"By far the best ice cream shop in my area. I love the tropical flavors that are offered (passion fruit when I was there).   The dairy flavors are also wonderful. You can tell they put love into the ice cream that they make."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The ice cream flavors are creative and DELICIOUS! Everyone is so friendly and they are really passionate about their product! They encourage you to sample every one! If you have a craving for ice cream this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  What a unique combination with the macroon and toasted marshmallow!  Definitely putting this on our favorites list!"}
{"text":"Came in with a few friends, have never been here before. Hard to spot at night from the street because the sign doesn't light up and the parking lot is dark.   Super chill spot, plenty of seating both inside and out. Decent prices, good portions and a nice selection of ice cream/toppings. I love their name and logo, the penguin is awesome so I definitely had to leave with a coffee cup (way to upsell me!). I commented on how slow it seemed when we got there, within five minutes there was a line out the door. Awesome little spot in the heart of South Scottsdale that didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the reviews that I'm seeing of 4 and 5 stars. Let me start with the good- The ice cream is good quality in somewhat interesting flavors (I chose cookies and cream and macadamia chocolate,  I think- but they also have Nutella and others). I got a cookie cup with 2 scoops and marshmallow. The macaroon, ice cream, and torch fired marshmallow blended to make a really good flavor and based on that alone, I could recommend this place. Because of what they charge for extremely small scoops of ice cream a small cookie and a bit of marshmallow ($10.21), I couldn't help but feel completely ripped off. When I say the serving I got was small... I mean 5 bites from a dixie cup small. I walked out of there wishing I'd driven to Sweet Republic or tried a different place."}
{"text":"This place had amazing reviews, and photos on Yelp looked amazing so we came out here for post-dinner dessert. I loved what I got, but was not overly impressed.   So you can make your own bowl here meaning you pick your 2 flavors of gelato, your choice of macaroon, one topping, and they add on a fired roasted marshmallow on top. They had some AWESOME gelato flavors. I had the chocolate malt and the mango habanero. Let me jus say... Ive had ice cream with a kick before, but nothing like this mango habanero. It was SPICY, and I got the malt flavor (which was amazing) to neutralize it essentially. They obviously don't compliment each other, but the malt was good to switch to when my tongue needed a break from the habanero.   Anyway, this place is a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because I just didn't feel like the macaroons were fresh or that good. I asked for the red velvet macaroon and I wasn't sure if they accidentally gave me the strawberry one. Regardless, it was alright. I think the macaroons overall here are underwhelming. The ice cream total was around $7 which I was OK with for the experience.   Anyway, for the 'gram this place is great. And for kids! If you want an exotic, crazy colored macaroon like you see in some of the Yelp photos, they may not have those/didn't when we went.   By the way, they do also have bubble tea! I didn't try any when I went, but there were some limited options on the menu.   There are a few tables and it was pretty empty when we went on a Friday night! It may be that they get more traffic earlier in the day."}
{"text":"I made my first visit to Fatty Daddy's on January 8th with my two best friends just after the Phoenix Bridal Show. I heard heard numerous good things about this place and was so eager to try and see what that was all about. Unfortunately my experience was negative and I will not be returning. The afternoon my three friends and I walked into amazing customer service from a young boy who was so kind in serving our sweet treats, which were quite delicious. We sat inside the establishment that day because it was a little chilly. What unfolded afterwards blew my mind.  It seems that the mother of the employee came in to speak to the (new) owner about a few issues so my company and I paid no attention.  Shortly (and I mean very shortly) there after the management took the conversation to an altercation type level with raised voice and all. WE WERE SHOCKED.  Owner was shouting, blaming the young boy aloud for a broken mug, saying he would not receive tips. I could NOT believe my eyes and ears.  I felt awful for this boy and as customers, we were put in such an awkward position sitting there while this was taking place.  Our sweet trip turned sour VERY quickly. It's a shame. We will not be returning and truly hope for the best of the employees that remain under the example of management we witnessed that afternoon."}
{"text":"Red velvet anything, french macarons, and toasted marshmallow are basically in my personal book for favorite desserts. So when I saw that this place has all 3 in one convenient cup I knew I had to have it.   I got a bowl with passion fruit ice cream with purple rain (blueberry muffin), with a red velvet macaron topped with not one but two toasted marshmallows. The guy who scooped it said he had never stacked two toasted marshmallows before but I saw in his heart that he had potential to be a jenga world champion and he did not disappoint.   Both the passion fruit and blueberry muffin ice cream were great but the perfect bite to me was a spoonful of the chewy macaron with some gooey marshmallow, and blueberry muffin ice cream, followed by the passion fruit for some contrast. It's amazing!  Really great place with nice people and especially excellent sweets."}
{"text":"Took a while to find, it's hidden and it would be helpful to have a little more sign other than on the door.  The toasted marshmallow was heaven and the coconut macaron was even more delicious than the marshmallow!  I tried the fudgesicle ice cream and it wasn't great but I can't wait to try more flavor a!  We will totally be back for more!"}
{"text":"best ice cream treats in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Decent ice cream in a little tucked away location off of McDowell and Miller. Lots of unique flavor offerings."}
{"text":"Great ice cream with unique flavors.. Captain Crunch is awesome. Also got a peanut butter chocolate bday cake banana shake. All great and service was awesone. Stop by for some great dessert."}
{"text":"Cereal flavored ice cream flavor along with traditional and unique sorbet  Get the \"luck of the Irish\"...this stuff will change your life  Really enjoyed the favors and the staff.   Owner was there...he's the real deal!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden new spot that you'll love. Make sure to get the cookie cup, you won't regret it!  Prices are more than reasonable and you'll love the artwork"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time now and I finally made it out there the other day. I put the directions in my GPS and I'm not gonna lie I thought I took a wrong turn because the location in kind of weird. The parking lot is dark but they do have a sign on the outside thats well lit.  Anyways, wasn't really sure what to expect and the staff member was super helpful. He let my friend and I sample as many flavors as we wanted and told us kind of the rundown of how things worked.   I ended up choosing banana ice cream and cinnamon toast crunch ice cream with a lemon macaroon. It was pretty tasty but I will say the cinnamon toast crunch cereal inside of the ice cream was super... soggy I guess you would say. I didn't care for the texture. The marshmallow was great though! my favorite part.   I like the concept, it was reasonably priced, nice staff, clean store and the ice cream definitely cured my sweet tooth. Next time I come I'll try different combo."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars but I didn't have that option. First of all, who pays $5 for a single scoop of ice cream?? When he rang me up with that scoop I literally thought I was paying for a free sample. Not worth my time or money. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Almost everyone loves Ice Cream and yes it is pricey for Ice Cream but it's hand made small batch ice-creams and sorbets where you have options to add house made macarons and other things to your ice-cream.  Fatty Daddy's is HARD to find because there isn't a sign. (at the time of this review)  I hear that the flavors change weekly so you might not be able to try what I had.  I had the cantaloup sorbet as a mini Fatty Daddy. That means I had one scoop, one macaron and the option to add a house made torched marshmallow. A better value might be the full size Fatty Daddy because that is THREE Scoops, Two Cookies and a Marshmallow. But I went with the mini because the full size is just too much for me.  I thought the Cantaloup Sorbet was Amazing because it tasted just like the ripest perfect cantaloup. I picked an Almond Macaron to go with it and skipped the marshmallow. The macaron had a nice flavor but a very chewy texture almost like gum.  My husband also had a mini Fatty Daddy with Cinnamon Crunch Ice-cream and he asked for a vanilla macaron. He said the Marshmallow was really good. The ice-cream tasted good but the cereal in it was soggy. We also think they gave him the wrong flavor macaron because it didn't taste like vanilla to us and might have been red velvet?   3.5 stars not perfect, a little pricey but unique and some flavors really rock!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Super tasting friendly service clean restrooms nice atmosphere great place for kids an adult's tool"}
{"text":"This place use to be good. Their cookie cup was the best. But the new owner decided to change it to a cheaper version; just one macaron instead of two and two sorry scoops of ice cream. But she decided to keep the prices the same. I miss the enthusiastic kids that used to greet you when you walked in. So long fatty daddy's"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable and great! The customer service was so fantastic, I had mentioned I was allergic to bananas and they mixed my ice cream with new scoops on a clean surface. Me and my best friend came here to satisfy our sweet tooths and we were not disappointed! I especially loved the finishing touch of the torch roasted marshmallow on top of our deserts"}
{"text":"We were looking for a fun new dessert place, so naturally I turned to Yelp!  The 5 stars certainly intrigued me so off we went!  It's located in a little quiet strip mall, but don't let that fool you! It's super clean and colorful inside and has a very welcoming atmosphere.   The owner was incredibly helpful and nice, along with his staff. They were truly excited to have us there and even more so, they were excited about their product which is huge!   They have some of the most amazing flavors I've ever seen for ice cream (lucky charms, chocolate birthday cake, captain crunch to name a few)! My daughter and I each got their almost-famous (but-soon-to-be-actually-famous) cookie cup, which had two homemade macaroons (perfectly cooked) with three scoops of whatever ice cream you want, topped with a toasted marshmallow (ummm YUM). My daughter got fruity pebbles flavored macaroons with captain crunch ice cream. The ice cream tastes just like the milk from a bowl of captain crunch along with pieces of the cereal in it! I got vanilla macaroons with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Both creations were amazing!! My husband got a rocky road milkshake that he said was really good. He was a little disappointed they didn't have plain chocolate ice cream, but he admitted the rocky road was delicious!  We will be heading here again! I love seeing new businesses succeed and excel at what they do!"}
{"text":"We catered at a clients and I don't know which was better, the amazing staff or the ice cream! What a great experience. Thank you so much Fatty Daddy's for such a memorable event."}
{"text":"This is an awesome hole in the wall. The cookie cup is $6.50 and comes with three scoops, a macaroon, and a marshmallow. So many different and creative flavors of ice cream and sorbets! Highly recommend. I got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream and a red velvet macaroon. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I ordered a scoop of coconut, it was creamy, flavorful & delicious.  The Almost Famous Cookie Cup looked awesome, it's huge. I ate a piece of my husbands coconut macaroon, one of the freshest & chewiest ever. Don't hesitate to try Fatty Daddy's and find your favorite flavor!!"}
{"text":"I though this place was just average. Although they have a ton of flavors and I like that they let you sample, it's not a memorable ice cream place for me. I didn't really care to try their ice cream sandwich. The price was not worth the protein and a dollar for a toasted marshmallow? Wow.   It's a very small establishment so seating is quite limited. I had the ginger matcha and mint chip. I thought the double scoop was pricey."}
{"text":"I donno. This place is a really cute idea, it makes for a great instagram picture (yeah, I said it). But it doesn't quite execute. The price is a little high for a single person so definitely split the Fatty Daddy with someone if you take that route. I'm dairy-free so I went with a sorbet. The mango sorbet is actually amazing! It's perfectly creamy and a little tart. But that's kinda where the excitement ended.   Macaroons... are just... so bland. They do nothing to add to the dessert except extra sugar. The toasted marshmallow was good because, c'mon, it's a marshmallow. But I was expecting it to be soft and to be able to integrate it in with my macaroon/sorbet bite. Instead, I ate the marshmallow separately because of how chewy it was.   Overall, doesn't feel like a cohesive dessert. Just three separate ingredients in a bowl together. Next time, I'll just get a scoop of sorbet. That's definitely worth the cost!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Very unique twist on ice cream. I would go here everyday if I lived closer. Macaroons are so good and the toasted marshmallow on top will make you whip and nay-nay like nobody's watching."}
{"text":"The location is their biggest struggle but the execution of delicious desserts is spot on. Started following hem on social media and all their concoctions look too notch. It's slightly tucked away in a small pointless shopping enter with bad signage but that must be overcome so your mouth and tummy can get a taste of what's going on here.  Didn't taste anything just dove straight in.  Went with the urkkel(sp?). Anything related to family matters circa 1995 is a must try. It was perfect. Added a fruity pebble macaroon which wasn't my first choice but they were out of the caramel. They threw on a toasted marshmallow that they brûléed right there and I was off to dessert nirvana. My counterpart went with a small scoop of Netfix and chill. We both voted mine to be the champ but her popcorn treat was different and fun."}
{"text":"Very good but a small portion for the cost of it. I order a large which was $8 and it was more like a medium and I would price more like $4.50"}
{"text":"What an awesome ice cream eatery! Had the Mini Daddy cookie cup with mango and passion fruit sorbet, and topped it off with an almond macaroon. All cookie cups come with a toasted marshmallow. It was delicious! My husband had a Nutella and Java milkshake, and really enjoyed his drink as well.   The interior was clean and super cute. This 80s baby loved the Steve Urkel painting on the wall. Jackson 5 songs were playing over the speakers, so it was a fun throwback atmosphere. The server who helped us was very polite, and encouraged us to try all their fun flavors, like the Urkel (chocolate and peanut butter) and Netflix and Chill (vanilla with popcorn and chocolate candy).   Check in on Yelp and get 10% off! Great deal. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome and tasty.   So much better than the national chains!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! As we walked in the only 2 guys working were super friendly and went over everything courteously despite closing in a few minutes Got a Big Daddy(?):  Macaron (Fruity Pebbles) + Ice Cream (2 choices: Banana Bread & Vanilla) + Macaron (Fruity Pebbles) + Toasted Marshmallow   Complementary water always a good touch!"}
{"text":"Bottom line..Customer service is great, icecream is terrible.  The icecream was the worst i have ever had in my life. It had no flavor and was soo icy. it was basically ice. Tried different flavors and they all tasted very artificial. Very disappointed as i was excited to try this place. I think they have the macaroons and the marshmallow to mask the terrible ice that they are selling. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"If you don't love this place, you are wrong.  If you are lactose intolerant, eat this ice cream anyway.  It is worth the pain.  Allergic to dairy?  Die happy.  Not a fan of ice cream?  You must be an alien or a lizard person."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been talking about & have visited Fatty Daddy's. (Officially our 4th time) Tonight is the first time we finally had the macaron cup sundae. Let me just say that it was definitely worth the wait. Because the 3 times we  came for the macarons cup sundae they were always out of macarons since they are made fresh and only last for 3 days. Don't wait too long before you go to Fatty Daddy's.  The location is hard to find but you wouldn't think to find it behind a Churches Chicken. Even though it's 10:30 at night & there is no bright neon signs you can still find Fatty Daddy's  by the amount of people who are inside this little mom & pop ice cream shop.  Tonight I had the Netflix & Chill ice cream which includes the chocolate covered pretzel and I went with the fruity pebble flavored macaron. This is my new favorite. All I can say is delicious!!!!  My friend who likes chocolate had the Nutella ice cream with the red velvet macaron, a must try!!! You will experience a chocolate lovers delight.   All macaron sundaes are topped off with a toasted marshmallow made directly in front of you. Fatty Daddy's is maybe a 20 minute drive from east Mesa but if you find yourself craving something sweet don't hesitate to come to this ice cream shop.  The decor is cute, the staff is helpful & super friendly, you have over 15 ice cream flavors to choose from, and you can't go to Fatty Daddy's and not try the  macaron cup sundae. There's the standard vanilla & red velvet macaron every day but you also have the special macaron of the month which can vary from coconut to fruity pebbles.  There's also plenty of topping to choose from to add to your ice cream cones or sundaes but I like to keep mine simple so the toppings don't over power the main ingredients.  Thanks Fatty Daddy's for giving us a new twist on ice cream."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden treat shop nestled around the corner behind the fitness business in the front of the building.   We had the cookie cup with mocha Java, lemon and also blueberry muffin ice cream flavors.  Good prices and the kids were friendly that worked there."}
{"text":"The cookie cup! So good! The variety of their ice cream is great too. Lots of interesting flavors and even the regular flavors have a unique and great taste to them."}
{"text":"Cute little shop that is a bit hidden. They have an excellent assortment of ice cream flavors that are all appealing.  They also serve boba and milk teas. Honestly, I wouldn't come here for that. I got a passionfruit milk tea and it wasn't very good. Everything else, yes."}
{"text":"The owner helped us and he was so nice and helpful- awesome guy. The ice cream flavors are delicious and super creative and he lets you try as many as you want! I had the almond macaron and it was awesome. Loved the peanut butter ice cream too! Fun little spot with friendly help!"}
{"text":"When Fatty Daddy's opened up, this place was really great.  The main attractions were the Fatty Daddy or Mini Daddy cookie cups, but the ambiance and staff were amazing too.  We went in the other night after not visiting in awhile and things felt... off.  Cookie cup? Is that the same thing we used to get? I thought there were two sizes.  My friend orders a cookie cup, but they only give him half a cookie and a smaller portion of ice cream than normal.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, but seemed a little nervous. We asked where the amazing Steve Urkel picture went, and the girl explained the business is under new ownership.  This explains everything.  Even the POS system is different, and doesn't offer rewards or incentives.  I even got a flier for Fatty Daddy's this week advertising \"Coffee, pastries, and ice cream, Relax, refresh, recharge!\"  It's an ice cream spot, not a day spa.  Say \"Ice cream, coffee, pastries\" at least- your name has the word Fatty in it... priorities people.  Anyway.  This spot is worth looking for and worth the trip.  The ice cream flavors are a solid mix of classics and unique blends.  If you've never been here before, you won't know the difference and it'll probably be a 5 star place for you.  But I feel new management may have cut out some of the charm and is trying to skimp on things that made us come back for more."}
{"text":"The cookie cup is so very tasty! Fell in love right away. The portion is a bit small, but I guess it's healthier for you? Lol"}
{"text":"Husband and I checked out this place after reading about it's opening. The article doesn't do it justice. The ice cream is on point, and I'll get to that, but the customer service was top notch. The guy at the counter took the time to explain each flavor and even let us sample each flavor. I settled on the Captain Crunch ice cream, which tasted like my childhood without the scratched up roof of my mouth like the cereal would give me. If you're looking for some unique, tasty ice cream flavors with friendly staff go here!"}
{"text":"Got the cookie cup and it was as awesome tasting as it looked. Cinnamon toast ice cream with a fruity pebble macaron topped  with toasted marshmallow. Highly recommend and the owner was so friendly."}
{"text":"The place is not too shabby. They sell gelato and sorbet.They have a ton of different flavor to choose from but I can't have everything so I had to force myself to choose just one. I got their $6.50 deal where you get 1 flavor a macron cookie topped with a roasted marshmallow. I chose the coconut flavored gelato with the caramel macron. I would definitely give the order a solid 7/10. Eating the whole this is a bit too sweet but I still finished it.  I like the atmosphere of the place. It's cozy and has a family owned business type of feel. The location is pretty hidden so I almost missed my turn so be sure to keep an eye out. Service was good. The cashier had a lot of patience dealing with us. There were 4 of us wanting to try everything so I definitely appreciate taking the time to get us what we asked.   Overall experience was good! 4 stars would be an accurate grade for it."}
{"text":"I love everything about macarons so when this place opened up, I had to give it a try. They usually offer 3-4 different flavors of macaron that is made locally. If you're on the west side she makes macarons and ice cream Macaron that you can get a pho 43!  Then you pick any flavor ice cream you want. The staff lets you sample the different ice creams if you're not sure what to get. Then you have the option to top your ice cream with a homemade marshmallow ( courtesy of fluff it marshmallow) and they roast it right in front of you. I would definitely recommend getting the roasted marshmallow on top  makes the dessert taste better"}
{"text":"Holy moly I was blown away haha. This place is hard to find and is totally a hole in the wall, you'd have no idea there's an amazing ice cream shop in there. I am a big fan of cute ice cream shops and sometimes I find ice cream places either are adorable and the ice cream is just ok, or ok atmosphere but great ice cream. Fatty Daddy's has both!  The decor is cute and trendy. We enjoyed our ice cream next to a huge picture of Steve Urkel also enjoying some ice cream. They have the ice cream nicely on display and have unique flavors that all sounded amazing. Lots of cereal related ones. I tried cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms but decided on lucky charms. Soooo good! The best part of that cereal plus ice cream..I couldn't say no to that. My sister and I got it as the little sundae with vanilla macaroons and a toasted marshmallow and shared it. I usually am a big eater and can eat anything no matter how much there is, but my sister and I together didn't even finish it because it was so rich! It was delicious, glad we shared it though haha. Used my yelp check in too and saved some money haha. Only complaint: my sisters friend got a mint chip scoop and there was like two chips in the whole cone, a little disappointing for her, but she did like the ice cream. Otherwise amazing and I've found a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Awesome cookie cups with very different ice cream fla ors Capitan Crunch, Apple jacks, Mangoniada n as well as Netflix n chill....A must try!!! When u come into Fatty Daddys everyone greats you with a big cheesy smile oh they let u try as many flavors as you like lol"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister for the first time. Their service is very friendly and inviting. They location is difficult to find so just keep your eyes open for their sign. I ordered their ice cream macron sandwich which was amazing! Their cookie was tasty and soft! This place is great for children and families."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out one evening and we are really glad that we did! The cookie cup was delicious (Lucky Charms ice cream... Does it get any better?) and the service was great. I'm sold on their innovative blending of macarons, ice cream and a toasted marshmallow. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Homemade marshmallow, macaroon and gourmet ice cream, what a wonderful combination.  The owner is super friendly and let you try pretty much whatever you asked for.  I give 4 stars because the macaroon was a bit chewy and lack of the usual almond flavor that I love."}
{"text":"Trust issues man.... Got the Grandma's Cookies and my sample tasted like snickerdoodle and I saw it had something else in it, but I wasn't sure what it was. And it ended up being.... You guessed it, oatmeal raisin. The descriptions should say what they actually are. My wife loved it, so that was nice."}
{"text":"We drove here for dessert after dinner. The place is a little hidden and has some weird parking LOL! The guy who worked there was super nice! He allowed us to try ice cream and wasn't rushing us at all. I got the coffee ice cream with the vanilla macaron and marshmallow on top. Delicious!! He gave us a pretty huge amount! The decor was simple, but there was room to sit and chat. Liked this place a lot. Should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype was it's in a sketchy area and I paid $6 for a kid size ice cream prob won't come back."}
{"text":"Two words: Cookie cup!!!  The cookie cup is composed of two macaron cookies sandwiching two scoops of ice cream, and topped with a roasted marshmallow. You can choose two different flavored ice cream for the two scoops. If you're feeling adventurous, you can add on the first topping for $.75, and each additional topping for $.50. The toppings are graham crackers, oreos, rainbow sprinkles, & chocolate sprinkles to name a few.   The workers were friendly and easy-going. Being an extremely indecisive person, I did not feel rushed to pick a flavor right away. They were really willing to have me sample all 24 ice cream flavors since there was no line behind me. I tried only two flavors, and fell in love with the mocha java yaya and mint chip. I was cracking up at some of the names for the ice cream, such as \"Netflix & Chill\". I would definitely try a couple of samples while having fun at it. The best part was seeing the marshmallow roasted by a torch right before our eyes. If you're looking for something lighter, they also have scoops of ice cream available.   This place did not quite get the five stars for me because of the price and sweetness. The first couple of bites into the cookie cup was out of this world amazing. However, the subsequent bites were truly sweetness overload. It's also treading on the pricey side - $7.50 for the cup. I have eaten larger macaron ice cream sandwiches with great flavors for only $4.50.   Overall, this place is great for kids. There is a complimentary water station by the napkins. If you're planning to eat your dessert on site, there are a handful of tables inside and a couple of tables outside.   Remember to check-in on yelp for 10% off your order. They also have a stamp card, buy 9 scoops of ice cream and get the 10th scoop free."}
{"text":"Thank the Lord for Fatty Daddy's. My family's dinner plans did not turn out as great as I was hoping for and figured lets try one last spot to save the night. Fatty Daddy's was the hero. This hidden gem offers great homemade ice cream selections, macaroons (yep, that's what I said), along with burnt marshmallow yumminess.   For my treat, I ordered the cookie sundae (there may have been a name for it I can not remember). With it came two scoops, a macaroon, and marshmallow. For my ice cream scoops I rolled with Nutella and fruity pebbles. The Nutella tasted like a Wendy's chocolate frosty and the fruity pebbles tasted, well, like fruity pebbles. Both were so good. I went with the fruity pebbles macaroon that was so chewy and flavorful. As for the marshmallow, not sure if it is homemade but it sure tastes like it.  The whole treat was a winner for sure.  The establishment was very comfortable with inside and outside seating and the young lady who prepared our treats was very friendly. She offered free samples for all who asked. Overall, a great dessert stop and glad we made the visit."}
{"text":"This place is everything. The location is a little weird and the prices are a little high but I've never been anywhere that make cookie cups like this. The ice cream flavor are so creative and always delicious. Same with the macarons! Staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent! I got the coconut and peanut butter - creamy and tasty.  Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Just realized I never wrote a review for Fatty Daddy's and this place definitely deserves one! I went here a few months back for some desert on my birthday and it was wonderful! It is a little hard to find as it's facing an odd direction in a small shopping plaza but it is a hidden gem. When you first walk in it's quite small with a few tables to sit down at (along with some tables outside) and it's super cute with bright fun colors inside. The lady who was working there was very nice and let us sample as many of the flavors as we wanted as it was our first time there. They have a lot of interesting flavors so I suggest trying a few that catch your eye. My favorites that I tried were the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and the Nutella. I decided on a cookie cup and got those two flavors and a red velvet macaroon, along with the toasted marshmallow on top. I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so yummy, but you can probably already tell by all of the pictures that everyone else has took. Everything about my cookie cup was delicious! The ice cream was of course wonderful, as well as the macaroon, but my favorite was the marshmallow. It was perfectly toasted and was slightly crispy on the outside and so gooey on the inside! I will definitely be coming back here and I can say with no hesitation that this is one of my new favorite ice cream places!"}
{"text":"Good ice cream, interesting concept with the cookie and the marshmallow.  A bit pricy for the portion but worth a try.  It's a bit hidden around the back."}
{"text":"First and last time here today. I wanted to try some ice cream with my family and so I came here with the expectation of some good customer service and awesome ice cream treats.   What I got was some mediocre ice cream and got one of their \"teas\" with boba. The ice cream was eh, but the toasted marshmallow was amazing! Of course that brings me to the Boba Tea. This was one of the worst tea's I have ever had. Not only did the dude not get my order wrong but the boba had to have been really old because it was rock hard instead of its typically gummy self.  Now that brings me to the customer service. Not only did he get my order wrong but he was very bland with my family and I. He saw we were first time goers but instead of being kind and suggesting things he just stood there and stared at us. He gave us our order and he then helped another customer but this time he was happy and very personable.   In summary, this place was something I wanted to try because it was a small buisness but never will I go again."}
{"text":"First time at Fatty Daddy's and it was amazing! They have all kinds of great flavors like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, blubbery muffin, Netflix and Chill, Chocolate birthday cake, and so many more! The girls are super friendly and helpful and the owner Brian was so friendly even gave us a sample of his new flavor with lucky charms! Great food and great people l, loved this place!"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty ice cream, and lots of interesting flavors. Habanero Mango anyone? I'd come back for sure.  Location is a bit difficult to find for people not familiar with the place, it is right next to the bicycle shop in case you get lost."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is very quaint and nicely tucked away from the main road. They offer ice cream, macaroons, coffee beverages, and pastries. I wasn't particularly impressed with their flavor selection. When I went, the case had majority fruit flavors. I typically prefer sweeter, dessert flavors. I got a single scoop, which was decently sized. The ice cream itself was average. Since it was my first time there, I got a free roasted marshmallow. The marshmallow was also average. Prices are slightly above average, and it's also $1.00 up-charge for waffle cone, bowl, etc. They have their signature item which is a scoop of ice cream, macaroon, and toasted marshmallow for $6.50, which I thought was mildly pricey for what you're getting. They had good service. Everyone was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Yumm. Was driving home when I saw Fatty Daddy's sign for the first time. This ice cream shop has ice cream in at least 22 different flavors. There are multiple toppings for you to choose from which includes their famous Macaroon Cup. I sampled 3 different ice cream flavors, all of which were delicious. I decided on peanut butter on a sugar cone. I had been thinking to myself recently how it is unfortunate that there is not an ice cream shop in South Scottsdale and now there's one right in my neighborhood. I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. I wonder if I walk to get ice cream, will I burn all the calories that I will consume from the ice cream?   Anyhow if you are looking to try something new swing by. The staff is friendly, cute dining area, and outside seating. I understand they will be having a grand opening this Saturday on 2/6/16."}
{"text":"Went with the Big Daddy cup or whatever it's called...   Tried a few flavors of gelato (salted caramel, coffee that I found too potently bitter) before settling in on chocolate chip. None of them were as smooth as I'd wanted.   For my macaroon I chose vanilla - it was the best part of the cup!   I was most excited about a toasted marshmallow on top, but it tasted salty and wasn't gooey all the way through because it's only toasted with a blow torch. Neat trick but it didn't live up to my expectations.   Also, the whole thing is tough to eat with the spoon they give. I ended up taking off the marshmallow, and using the macaroon as my spoon."}
{"text":"I'll give it three stars because they were super nice and my kids loved it. I just personally found the ice cream to be way too overly sweet and not that flavorful. Felt like I was eating a spoon of sugar."}
{"text":"I had an unfinished draft with a five star but my recent visit to this place was an utter disappointment. Let me clarify before start, that I had been a loyal customer for the last year, and when I heard this place was sold to a new ownership I was wishing that the flavors will be the same. Well, they were the same, they didn't add anything new or took out anything so I was relieved. I got the smallest cup as I can't finish bigger ones with the usual macaron and marshmellow topped by myself but the small wasn't the same small. That wasn't all. My friend got a bigger size and we witnessed the lady (I assume she's the new owner) taking half a scoop back to the tank after examining how much she had originally scooped. I didnt even feel like tipping her because she didn't say a single word until she handed us our orders. I'm not sure if they decided to keep the old employees (because I never returned after) but the other employees were actually really friendly. I got my ice cream and it was good, but I know this is not the only place I can get premium ice creams."}
{"text":"Awsome customer service. Love the the french macaroon.  They let u try ice cream and r not rude about it."}
{"text":"Fatty Daddy use to be amazing, but the original owners sold around November and everything is on a very bad spiral downwards. The new owner, Lana Zhou, continually has bounced employee checks and then it's a fight for the employees to get their money. Most recently employees had to explain to her the new minimum wage laws and she since said she would pay them the appropriate rate but take away their tips. As you'll notice, tip jars are still out and it's requested when you pay with card. FYI- that's not going to the employees.   She will degrade her employees in front of customers to the point where customers will yell at her, stand up for employees, and vow to never return. It's a shame such a great neighborhood ice cream place with so much potential is now on the road to closure because of mismanaged funds and poor management.   If you support local business- this is not the one"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The ice cream is very unique. Go here if you are in the mood for something new and unusual! Their fruity pebbles ice cream tastes just like the cereal! I only wish they had a few more elements from your everyday ice cream store- like chocolate ice cream. Overall good experience though."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I absolutely love it! You have to get the cookie cup! You pick your ice cream, the flavor of your giant macaron, and then you get a toasted marshmallow square on top. I'm a huge texture person when it comes to ice cream and the macaron in the ice cream plus the marshmallow just really does it for me.  They have lots of flavors that are constantly changing. Last time I went there were three different cereal inspired flavors. The time before that there was a ginger matcha. They're always changing up their flavors so you can always have something new to try. Same with their macaron flavors. I saw they recently added a fruity pebbles macaron which I didn't end up trying but sounded yummy!   Decent amount of seating inside and out so you can enjoy your ice cream. Not the biggest shop but I've never gone and not had a place to sit."}
{"text":"Good place, easy to find. Ice cream was thicker than most ice creams I've had but still not bad"}
{"text":"What a delightful little place! I was looking for a new dessert place to try and found this one and couldn't believe my luck... all my favorite things in one place and all in one cup! I ordered the fatty daddy and decided to get adventurous with all the flavors I love. I did not even care that the flavors did not really go together. I got with a scoop of mint and a scoop of peanut butter with a strawberry and a lemon macaroon and the toasted marshmallow on top. It was so fun eating and experiencing each of the different flavors and textures. I was surprised that the taste and texture of the macaroon was actually really good since this place is not a macaroon store or a bakery, but rather more of an ice cream shop. They do sell just the macaroons as cookies and they are very decently priced! After finishing my fatty daddy, I really regretted not getting two toasted marshmallows on top. Finding the location was a little difficult since it was not visible from the road and hidden behind a gym and some other store. I highly recommend trying this place at least once! I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good gelato but expensive! Old Town better but closes too early! They do not have pistachio. Less choices and a bit of a wait when crowded...it is our backup! Waffle cones are fair! The young man who works there is very nice!"}
{"text":"They gave us many tastes to try. Super delish! We got the soon-to-be-famous cookie cup which had 2 scoops of ice cream with a macaron and a toasted marshmallow. I had raspberry sorbet and chocolate sorbet. It was yummy. My friend enjoyed hers too."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum!  We came here after a show at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I had searched for someplace new to go (on Yelp, of course) and came across Fatty Daddy's.  It was on our way home and looked really interesting, so I took my fiancé there.  The decor is not much different than most indie ice cream/gelato shops.  It was comfortable and friendly.  The staff was fantastic.  They answered our questions with smiles, made recommendations, and the man who we can only imagine was the owner, came out to check and make sure everything was good.  After tasting a few flavors, my fiancé had the blueberry muffin ice cream with graham cracker crumbs and red velvet macaroons, but does not like marshmallow so stopped there.  I was trying to stay non-dairy so I had the chocolate sorbet with red velvet macaroons and a toasted marshmallow.  All I can say is, we did not leave a single drop or crumb.  When the owner came out and asked my fiance how the ice cream was, all my fiance could say was \"Gone!\"  The ice cream is obviously freshly made daily, as well as the macaroons.  They were very fresh.  The marshmallows were tasty too.  I can't wait to go back and try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was mediocre and I had to ask for the marshmallow which the cookie cup was supposed to come with. Only had 2 flavors of macaroons too which were bland. Tiny two scoops for 8 dollars."}
{"text":"Finally a ice cream place in the neighborhood!! Great flavor options and fun toppings. We had the Fat Daddy and it was perfect to share! Will be back soon :) Sure it's kind of hard to find and doesn't really have a sign, but cut them some slack! (Maybe a parking lot light would be nice though)"}
{"text":"Seriously good ice cream.  Had unique and fun flavors like \"captain crunch\" \"cinnamon toast crunch\" and \"strawberry moscato.   I went with a cookie cup (must get) with papago peach beer and blueberry muffin.  It was amazeballs. Not sure if living across the street is a good or bad thing."}
{"text":"Just North of Church's and the fitness place, tucked away in a tiny strip mall. We got gluten-free brownies with ice cream. So delicious! The place is bright and friendly. So glad we found it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The range of flavors is great, and the cookie bowl is delicious. I love that everything is made in house! What they do works, pick an ice cream flavor, add a cookie, and top with a toasted marshmallow. It was so good I went back with a friend a week later."}
{"text":"The Ice Cream was delicious they have 24 different flavors and are willing to let you try them all until you are positive on your decision. I got the Fruity Pebbles macaroons with Capn Crunch ice cream and a gourmet toasted marshmallow on top. It is Mock my words \"To Die for\"."}
{"text":"Fudge creation was a dream, best I ever Tasted.  Was tucked in almost missed it.  Could use a small billboard sign that you take in at night, to let passerby's know that you are there.  We almost passed it up but we're determined to have a treat. Great ice cream !!"}
{"text":"What a great concept. It's all about the roasted marshmallow on top. The ice cream flavors are awesome. I had Nutella. My only feedback would be that I prefer my macaron to be fresh, not frozen and though the combination was delicious I think it would be even better if macaron wasn't crispy.  This little gem is hidden behind the Church's chicken on the corner of Miller and McDowell and easy to miss. I'm glad I found it!  Update.... I returned here after telling hubby how awesome it was and it was a disappointment. A lot of money for same tasteless ice cream and the macaron was stale. The components need to be right. Unfortunately they were a miss."}
{"text":"This was good because it's hotter than blazes so cold is refreshing, but the ice cream is mediocre. The flavors are pretty bland. I would not go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"A nice little place hidden in back of a shopping center but worth a visit. Their ice cream and Gelatos are excellent with a large variety. Get it with a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top and you won't be disappointed. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal, friendly service.  Inventive ice cream flavors, especially enjoyed Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  The marshmallow was flambeed to perfection.  Unfortunately, the macaron was meh.  Very chewy, and that's not how macarons should be."}
{"text":"It's looks a little sketchy when you pull up . It has a dark parking lot but don't let that fool you. The treats are delicious! We got the Fatty Daddy and it was so yummy! Definitely go get your sweet tooth on!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Definitely a unique dessert option. We had a pineapple/strawberry ice cream cup with a strawberry macaroon and toasted marshmallow. Soooo good. We'll be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Ok yes.  I was so impressed with this place I'm not sure I can write a good enough review to express it.  This place doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it is filled with sweet goodness and perfection.   I ordered the salted caramel and coconut ice cream. The salted caramel is packed with so much flavor I would say get it and it's sure to be anyone's favorite flavor!!!! The ice cream is super soft, almost more or a gelato.  They had many fun flavors including the fruity pebbles flavor the hubby got which tasted exactly like it.    You then get to pick your flavor of macaroon to go on top.  They take these out of the chilled fridge and place on top.  Next is a home made marshmallow that they then torch and it becomes more of a creme brûlée texture and flavor!! Coming from the girl who haaaates marshmallows I forgot to tell her to skip mine. I took a bite and couldn't believe how delicious it was!!!!! Nothing like a typical marshmallow.   I wish there was one located by us because I won't be forgetting this desert any time soon.  Try this place out.. it's a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good little spot for ice cream. Came across it after hiking Camelback mtn. Good flavors. Small scoops was the only drawback. Especially for the price. $7 for 2 scoops. It would of been 4 or 5 stars with bigger scoops."}
{"text":"One of the best I e cream shops I've ever stopped at! They insist you try as many flavors as possible, and you should, and each option is somehow better than the last. The staff is ridiculously nice, super clean inside, and several amazing sorbets for dairy free options.  I'm excited to go back again, and again."}
{"text":"It was very delicious, if it's your first time definitely get the cookie cup because the marshmallow goes very well with the macaron, the flavors I would suggest is the captain crunch and fruity pebbles. Those two flavors were delicious and true to their names. So if you don't like those cereals you can avoid those flavor too."}
{"text":"This place looked promising but was \"meh\" in my opinion. It was a nice establishment and the guys who worked there were very friendly and helped me decide on what to get, they even told me about the Yelp discount and said I could use it every time I come in, so I'd give the customer service 5 stars. The ice cream itself, not so much. I thought the concept of the roasted marshmallow and macaroon on top of ice cream was a brilliant idea, or maybe I just had a sweet tooth that day, but when I ate what I ordered it was such a let down! I give an A for effort of the concept but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would turn out."}
{"text":"I think I just died and went to ice cream heaven!!!! Awesome and unique flavors, local owners and ingredients, exceptional customer service and the penguin is the cutest! Try Fatty Daddy's right now, go, hurry, they're almost out of macaroons and marshmallows that they torch on top of your ice cream, yes, warm gooey marshmallow all up on the best dessert of your life!"}
{"text":"Honestly, don't see why this place is so highly rated. The idea is kinda cool and I wanted to like it but I left incredibly disappointed.   My boyfriend and I ordered the signature Fatty Daddy's and weren't impressed. We actually didn't like the ice cream and thought it lacked flavor. It also cost over 8 dollars so it definitely wasn't worth it.   There is definitely better ice cream shops in the area and I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I decided on a cookie cup because of the many reviews I read. It wasn't too hard to find especially because I came during the day. Yes, it was in a building right next to a painting supply shop (I think). My cookie cup consisted of coffee ice cream, Oreo topping, caramel macaron and a toasted marshmallow. It was delicious and loved every bite.   I wish I didn't share with my hubby because to me, it's only enough for one, not to share. Next time, I'm not sharing. The prices are above average- with my additional topping, it came out to be close to $8 including tax."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream and the mini fatty daddy is just enough of an indulgence without being too sweet. The Netflix and chill is the perfect combo of salty and sweet ice cream and the macaron and toasted marshmallow are an awesome addition.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"It was ok... After seeing the reviews I figured it would be love at first lick, but it wasn't. My husband and I got the cereal themed ice creams, and while they were ok, they were nothing special. It all seemed much harder than gelato or ice cream I'm used to. The woman and young girl were very pleasant.   Also, when you put this in navigation is isn't incredibly easy to find unless you're driving southbound. The parlor is small as well as the parking lot. We don't live in the area, but I'm glad we tried it while we were in town."}
{"text":"This place is super mediocre. I had one of the cookie cups, and while I do appreciate the care behind the freshly toasted marshmallow on top, the macarons were nothing special, and the ice cream was really, REALLY sugary and not creamy at all. The texture of the ice cream was far too watery. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Hidden Jewel nice people great ! The Best was the macaroon cookie and the fired marshmallow. A must try when in Scottsdale! Mc Dowell and Miller is the cross streets. It's truly a recommendation!    The kids loved seeing the marshmallows fired right in front of them. Thanks for the treat today!"}
{"text":"First time here and this ice cream is really good! Staff is very friendly and very clean, the girl helping me washed her hands after touching anything that wasn't sanitary! Very welcoming and let me sample anything I wanted to try. Afterwards I got a really cool ice cream with the cookie and marshmallow! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Location is small and cute. The Gelato is delicious. Having a macaroon on top of ice cream is interesting. It became a bit chewier than I expected but nonetheless still good.   They have Boba and coffee but their mainstay is their ice cream gelato.   If you are close by it is def worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always bring visitors, haven't had a bad experience yet aside from they should have more people working now that it's getting more popular.  Macaroons are thin and chewy especially when combined with the heat of marshmallow. You are able to test the ice cream flavors, they're unique and I thought to be very creamy and delicious.   Definitely worth going to get the whole sha-bang.   Kind of a weird hidden spot, I'm not sure how people would know about this place aside from word of mouth. They definitely deserve a better location."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! You won't find these snacks and flavors anywhere else!  The macarons are fresh and chewy, with a crispy exterior. The red velvet is a fav. Be sure to get a cookie cup, which has your favorite flavor smooshed between 2 macarons and topped with a homemade marshmallow, charred to order!   My pals named the Netflix & Chill, which you have to try! Basically all of your movie night snacks in one ice cream...salty and sweet! You can't lose with Lucky Charms, Breakfast Cereals, Blueberry Muffin or Berry Moscato. This place is serious."}
{"text":"Fatty Daddy's is the new Sugar Bowl. The ice cream is not expensive and the portions are huge! There are many flavors to pick and you can add macaroons. It's a great place to go anytime. I highly recommend this place to anyone who has a sugar tooth. ASU students get 15% and Yelpers get 10%. Check this place out. It's behind Church's."}
{"text":"Sooo good! The marshmallow on the top is just perfectly caramelized. I don't think there is another ice cream place around here that compares to this place!"}
{"text":"I went to Fatty Daddy's last year and loved it!! Good ice cream flavors and unique cookie cup. I went back this year with friends and was so disappointed! The cookie cup price didn't change but the lady said the \"menu changed\". I got two tiny scoops and one cookie instead of two. Once my friends saw how small the portions were they didn't order anything. The flavors weren't as good this time either. I don't plan on going back! I can get a DQ blizzard for half the price and triple the ice cream. Don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Really unhappy with my experience the guy was nice that worked there but the ice cream selection isn't the best. And their prices to their portion sizes are ridiculous I got a \"double scoop\" with a marshmallow and Oreos and it was $11 which I would not mind if it came with a decent amount. I got the SMALLEST AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM I will never go back."}
{"text":"THE TOASTED MARSHMELLOW!   I had a few friends in town today and we were in the mood for something sweet but something that wouldn't leave us full to the point that we wouldn't want to do anything the rest of the afternoon. Fatty Daddy's was just the spot!  We each tried the toasted marshmellow on top and it was hand fired in front of us with a hand butane torch. As for the ice cream they had everything from a fruity pebbles and sorbets to coffee and hazlenut, and they were all amazing (we tried at least 5 each).   The place is very clean and the owner was very sweet as well as patient as we tasted our way to the perfect flavor."}
{"text":"Can we talk about the Cookie Cup? Cause it's fabulous. Ice cream is delicious. Staple flavors along with some fun and unique ones thrown into the mix. Netflix and Chill? Fruity Pebbles? So fun. I don't think I've ever had a macaroon and now I don't know how I have lived this long without them. In a world where froyo is the new thing, Fatty Daddy's is still doing ice cream just right."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the cookie cup was amazing. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Gelato, macaroon, and a toasted marshmallow, very basic- kinda overpriced. The gelato is tasty, variety of flavors to pick from! The marshmallows and macaroons aren't anything unique. Small seating, cute/clean restroom, limited parking. It's yes for some people to find this place as it's tucked back in a dark ally."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO FLAVORLAND! Tucked away in a strip mall just an alleyway from McDowell Fatty Daddy's was beyond satisfying for my \"after a movie sweet snack\". I was greeted with a very professional ice cream sales man. He was knowledgeable about their gelato & sorbets and gave me a run down of the menu. I choose the specialty cookie cup that layers: a scoop of their gelato (chocolate chip), a macaroon ( I picked almond), and a perfectly toasted marshmallow square on top. I will be going back to try the dairy free gelato."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend nearby and got a serious craving for ice cream. Of course I turned to Yelp for suggestions on where to go as I was not familiar with that neighborhood. Fatty Daddy's came up, and as soon as I saw that toasted marshmallow in pictures I was sold. I grabbed my bag and run out of the house and headed to fatty Daddy's. The parlor is small but very cozy with tables and chairs that I can accommodate from a small group or push together for a bigger group. They have a pretty good selection of ice creams the most unique I saw was mango habanero. The lady behind the counter indulged my desire to sample the different flavors.  I got a double scoop of the mango habanero for my sister because she loves ice cream and she loves spice. I didn't tell her what it was but when she tasted it the look on her face said everything. She loved it! For myself I chose the Irish whiskey cream flavor. You could really taste the flavor of the whiskey without it actually being alcoholic. I got a double scoop with the toasted marshmallow on top. It was fun to watch praise the blowtorch to get the candy toasted, and it tasted amazing. My only critique was that the ice creams were not as creamy as I had hoped they would be, and the banana flavor they have is not as sweet as I expected. Otherwise this place is pretty legit and I would probably go back another time."}
{"text":"Meh. Had better. Small scoops and lackluster flavor. Not sure why this place is rated so higj"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and wanted something yummy for dessert...looked on YELP and found this AMAZING place. I had the white chocolate raspberry and strawberry cheesecake ice cream in my cookie cup. I chose the coconut macaroons and it was topped off with a warm Marshmallow.....it was delicious and highly recommend! They opened 3 months ago and it's a great find!"}
{"text":"It was good. A little different. Special is a cookie bowl: gelato/sorbet topped with a macaroon and toasted marshmallow. I chose salted caramel and coconut macaroon with toasted marshmallow. Interesting combo but you have to like marshmallows. Wife had a delicious coffee. Price was a little high if you didn't love it. Service was good from the counter and relatively clean though it was late Friday night and only one worker. Probably won't go out of my way to be back."}
{"text":"This place is a place I would try once. I think I was expecting much more because the pictures on yelp look so good.   I ordered the big daddy ice cream sandwich. It comes with two huge macaron cookies and your choice of ice cream flavors. Then it is topped with a marshmallow toasted to your preference.   I really like the concept of this place. The ice cream is really presented in a beautiful manner. However, the ice cream itself was not creamy enough for me. The ice cream had a ice like consistency. Also the macaron became so hard because the ice cream froze the cookie. The macaron gets lost in this modern sundae. The macaron because frozen and soggy.   Overall, I would suggest trying it once. You would get a cute Instagram picture. But, personally I don't see myself getting my ice cream fix from here again."}
{"text":"Pros: Creative concept Good location near enough to campus Cookie and yogurt flavors so far have been good Solid service from nice employees  Cons: Portions are small (only one half of a small macaron cookie) for the high price The parking lot is not lit up with lights at night so it is way too dark"}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money. It's an insult to call Fatty Daddy's \"gelato\" gelato or even ice cream. Our server was not kind or helpful in the least bit and seemed to be more interested in the games on his laptop than helping us. The inside was grimy. We paid $7 each for the cookie bowls and the only edible part was the toasted marshmallow. Calling the macaroons a macaroon is an insult once again. It should be called a wafer or something equally as gross sounding, because it tasted awful. Gas station quality ice cream + half a cold, flavorless wafer + a toasted marshmallow should not equal $7. We will not be back."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were greeted by super friendly and excited staff who told us we could try every flavor if we wanted. All their ice cream is homemade and they get their macaroons special made from a local bakery (deliveries come on Thursdays). We decided on a macaroon cookie bowl, which I HIGHLY recommend getting. The ice cream was probably the best I have ever had; you can definitely tell it is homemade. We decided on their Lucky Charm ice cream was crazy good and got the fruity pebble macaroon, which was gooey and perfect in every way. This would have been enough for me to be thrilled, but then they put it over the top with a toasted marshmallow! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Oh my heaven, this place is better than words can describe!   My sister and I visited Fatty Daddy's on a whim after dinner and we were so glad we did!! I ordered their Fatty Daddy special with mango and Nutella ice cream, a vanilla macaroon with a deliciously toasted marshmallow on top. It was literally spectacular. All of their ingredients are fresh and organic, you can really taste it in every bite.   The service was wonderful, the lady helping us was very kind and helpful. I will be returning to Fatty Daddy's every chance I get."}
{"text":"Came to this location on recommendation of a friend. It's a cute place with interesting ice cream, but to be honest, it's really hard to find if you're trying to come here alone- I don't think I could've found this place if it weren't for my friend, so that's the only reason for the docked star. I personally am a sucker for cute interior seating and exterior looks and Fatty Daddy's lacks in that department.   Although lacking in aesthetics, the ice cream itself is really yummy! I had the strawberry sorbet and it came in the perfect portion. They also have really creative options for a pretty affordable price ($2-$6).  If you're looking for a more low key kind of place with a variety of selection I would highly recommend! (just make sure you know where you're going before hand lol)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Such a great experience overall. We wanted some dessert after dinner and luckily this place was nearby. We weathered the storm to come here (literally...the street we wanted to go through was flooded and we had to take a detour). I was surprised to see the shopping center it was in, it looked like a residential area but there are a few other shops. Totally tucked away but they already have word of mouth so they don't need the visual exposure.  The young gentleman working was friendly and gave us samples of the mango habanero (mouth watering btw...sweet with just a slight kick at the end). We decided to split one of their almost-famous cookie cups and chose the hazelnut chocolate ice cream, a vanilla macaron, and topped with a toasted marshmallow. Y'all...this was so good. I can't believe it took me so long to come here. The only issue I have is the macaron didn't really jive with the rest of the dessert so I would've skipped that if I knew. It would've been delicious on its own. The marshmallow though...as a marshmallow fanatic, it was fabulous and melty and just perfect. The cup costs $6.50 and it's nice to split with someone else.  Loved this place! Hope to come back again."}
{"text":"Wow! This is some good ice cream!!! I had the special where you pick 1 flavor of ice cream, 1 flavor macaroon and a huge toasted marshmallow! I chose chocolate sorbet with the fruity pebble macaroon! Omg was it good!!! I would totally drive again to go here! I gave 4 stars because the service wasn't very good! Usually when your a first time customer they make suggestions. The girl wasn't friendly and didn't smile, almost seemed irritated we were there so we ate outside."}
{"text":"Nummy- great service. Try it. You will love  it. The ice cream is incredible. The macaroons are amazing too."}
{"text":"Cool (ha ha) place for ice cream. Good service but pretty pricey. We used a Groupon which took the bite (ha ha) out of it but it was still $12 for not very much. I wlll save this for special events. If you do not choose teh Daddy specials with the macaroon, you will save some dough but then it won't be so special..."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and was looking for a dessert spot on my way home. A quick Yelp search landed me here!   Located down a driveway off the Main Street. Be sure not to be going to fast or else you'll miss the drive way turn. Next to a couple other business, there's parking in front and on the side . I came at night and there was plenty of parking . Might be harder during the day when the other businesses are open?  Inside was clean and spacious . Indoor seating with board games available to play.   I was the only one inside . Person being the counter was super chill and friendly. It was my first time so he explained to me what they are known for . I was sold on the COOKIE CUP!!   First : choose ice cream (good selections ) Two : choose macaroon (also good selections )  Three : choose toppings  Four: gotta add the toasted marshmallow!   A little pricey but soooo good! Hit the sweet tooth perfectly !"}
{"text":"Staff was polite and idea has a lot of potential but I wasn't impressed with the quality of ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one for gimmicked ice cream, but occasionally I do stumble upon places where I make an exception. Fat Daddy's is one of those places where what they're doing simply just works - and works quite well.  Essentially, you choose your ice cream flavor, add a macaron, and top it off with a toasted marshmallow. The triple combination works incredibly well together, creating three layers of a sweet treat that blends in perfectly due to its high quality.  You are free to sample ice cream flavors. I ended up with Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a coconut macaroon, while my girlfriend chose banana ice cream with a red velvet. Both were very good, but we both agreed that my choice was superior. It's really just finding the \"right\" combinations that work best together.  Overall, we were quite pleased. I really like that you can opt for child-sized scoops and aren't forced to pay for a giant-sized scoop for an often overpriced flat fee. We'll definitely be back to try some of their other flavors while updating this review accordingly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Amazing ice cream and the best customer service! The toasted marshmallow is a must!!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is awesome! Gelato, a macaroon, and a homemade marshmallow all in one cup! Yes please!!  The location doesn't have a main road store front it's in a small strip mall with parking. If it wasn't for yelp we wouldn't have found this gem! When you walk in the door you start at the counter to order, you can get normal cone or you can get the cookie sundae! Which is awesome, and there is a seating area to enjoy your treat!  I got the cookie sundae, chocolate hazelnut gelato, caramel macaroon cookie, with the home made marshmallow that is toasted to order! So YUM!!!! The gelato was good, the macaroon cookie is not a full macaroon with the filling but it's okay, texture is good, but the toasted marshmallow!! I can totally just eat the marshmallow by itself.   Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"With what looks like small serving sizes when you first enter. Fatty Daddy's is pretty heavy handed with their two scoops. The ice cream is great. This place is a great hidden gem in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Great flavorful ice cream, so many unique flavors to chose from. The macaron is soft and fresh with intense flavor. Friendly faces behind the counter too!"}
{"text":"Although I must admit that the ice cream flavors here are unique and good, it is a bit pricey. Especially the famous cookie cup - roasted marshmallow on top of 2 macarons and 2 scoops of ice cream."}
{"text":"Went here last night for some dessert. I found out about them on Yelp. The cookie cup with the macaroon cookie was delicious! They had so many flavor a to pick from. The only thing I did not like was that the names of their ice creams were very odd and so the names were not self explanatory. I got the morning mess which was a combinations of 3 cereals. I got it with the red velvet macaroons. It was a lot of ice cream! And only like 7 or 8$. Working at coldstone in the past  this place was pretty cheap! And the customer service was great. They didn't have enough thawed out morning mess so the guy filled my cup up with another ice cream I asked for but he proceeded to also give me a little cup of what they had in their freezer. He said it was too frozen to put on my cookie cup."}
{"text":"Wow amazing ice cream get the cookie cup worth every dollar... will definately come back delish............................ .. .. .  .."}
{"text":"The cookies are to die for!  I may go back just to get cookies.  I don't need the ice cream even though it was delicious also.  Not giving 5 stars just because of the lousy location."}
{"text":"Went in here a few days ago craving something new and delicious and that is exactly what I got. I shared a cookie cup with my son and he LOVED it. The macaroons are chewy which is one of the many reasons why the cookie cup is so mouthwatering. The ice creams are creamy and delicious and come in fun and exciting new flavors that you won't find at your neighborhood Cold Stone.  Not only is their ice cream amazing, so is their service. We met one of the owners and he welcomed us with a warm smile and let us taste test their marvelous flavors. He was nice enough to answer the many questions I had about Fat Daddy's, even going as far as to tell me about how he and his business partners came across the darling table and chairs and the amazing artwork on their walls.   This will definitely be a place I take my friends and family when they visit from CA and I will be returning often for those fantastic cookie cups!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! They have super creative flavors, the lucky charms was amazing! Staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"What a creative delicious little place. Awesome customer service and great ice cream with cookies and marshmallow. I got a mini daddy and it was great!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the good reviews and delicious looking photos. There wasn't a lot of variety in either flavors or menu offerings. $4 is a lot for a single scoop of ice cream especially when it isn't very good. The chocolate flavor tasted sugary sweet, rather than having a rich chocolate flavor. The mint chip had a very strong after-taste that wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Great flavor omg awesome!! However on a weekend night they REALLY need a second person to help out!!!! A bit slow on weekends!"}
{"text":"Def a place to try, I would give it 4.5 if I could. I got two flavors Milk Malt ball & Salted caramel; with the signature macaron and toasted marshmallow. The milk malt ball was good, not my favorite, but still good! I am not one to choose caramel ice cream, but I definitely made the right choice that one was yummy. I do not really like marshmallows either, but it was so good and mixed with the macaron made it my favorite part! Customer service was really good! I tried over seven flavors &I I even tried a flavor twice. I would be annoyed with myself, but he was patient and very kind"}
{"text":"If I'm going to burn calories, it should be worth my sweat. The place is in a remote area and the ice cream was a hair shy above fry's. I'm all for promoting local businesses yet; it seems like they just wheeled in a few coolers,  purchase art work with a Fat Albert look alike decor to spice up the location and this makes this place awesome? Invest in your products, order enough macaroons to fulfill your weekend crowd and make your ice cream taste less frost bitten and then we can speak awesome!"}
{"text":"After a giant meal at a KBBQ, my little group of friends wanted to grab some dessert. It was pretty difficult since it's New Years and lots of places we wanted to go to were closed. However, my cousin suggested this place and i'm so glad she did! The combination of ice cream, macaroon, and toasted marshmallow is absolutely amazing. I decided on coffee and chocolate ice cream with a vanilla macaroon (a giant one too!); I felt heaven in that cookie cup. Would definitely go again(:"}
{"text":"AMAZEBALLZZZZZ!!!! Great customer service, fun staff and they know their products! I can't wait to go back very soon! And let's not forget they got great music!"}
{"text":"Wide variety of good stuff. Ice cream, pastries, coffee and other drinks. Had the coffee, it was excellent, and friendly service. Will definitely visit again if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Saw the pictures for the cookie cup here on Yelp and had to come in and try it when we were in the neighborhood.  The space is in a small strip mall a little off the main road. Hard to find unless you're looking for it. The store itself is on the smaller side with a few tables and chairs for seating. It's bright and airy in there with lots of colorful accents as well as several ice cream flavors and coffee beverages for the taking. We arrived on a Saturday night and it wasn't terribly busy and there was only one woman behind the counter working who was very nice and helpful.   Since I was here specifically for the cookie cup, that's what I decided on. The cookie cup consists of a scoop of ice cream with a macaron shell on top and a toasted marshmallow. I love all of these things so I imagined combined they would be pretty great. And I was correct--it was delish! I had the cookies and cream ice cream with a red velvet macaron. The melty, crispy, marshmallow on top was the perfect gooey addition. Sugar overload but oh so good.   My only complaint is that my serving seemed to be much smaller than some of the photos I've seen on here. Like mine only had the one macaron cookie shell while others had two and seemed to have more ice cream. I didn't notice different size options on the cookie cup, so maybe you have to ask for a double or something for the larger (I'll fully cop to being wrong here) but I was a bit surprised when I got my order since it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Now, don't get me wrong, what I had was PLENTY. I don't know if I could have finished larger. However, if the price point is the same for less product then that's something worth noting. In general, whether I ordered a smaller size or not, it felt a little high for one scoop of ice cream, half a cookie, and a marshmallow.   So yeah, very good, but a little too pricey to make it a regular treat if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"The ice cream, marshmallow and cookie thing is a pretty good combination. Unfortunately this place is so dirty that I wouldn't want to come back. Dirty floors, dirty walls, dirty tables, trash overflowing. It was just gross to sit there and eat."}
{"text":"Fatty Daddy's is the new ice cream spot in my neighborhood so i had to give it a try. DANGEROUSLY GOOD! Ive been craving a cookie cup since Friday!! After trying every single flavor (because they have so many) I got a vanilla macaroon with the coffee ice cream. The cookies are soft but so chewy at the same time and the ice cream has so much flavors. The marshmallow on top is what makes the entire cookie cup. Everyone who works there is so nice and helpful. Hands down best dessert stop in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is something else. The flavors are on point and the cookies are unreal! I used to have a favorite ice cream shop until I stopped in to check this place out. I recommend stopping in and checking it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed! I had the red velvet cookie cup with grandma's cookies, gram cracker topping, and a toasted marshmallow on top. WOW!"}
{"text":"A macaron ice cream sandwich with a Fluff It marshmallow on top? Yes please! There are so many options too, including some very unique ones such as Fruity Pebbles macarons and Netflix and Chill ice cream.  The cookie cup consists of two large macarons of your choice (They had strawberry, vanilla, Fruity Pebbles, and red velvet when I was here), four scoops of ice cream, with a marshmallow that is bruleed with a torch in front of you. We got ours with Fruity Pebbles and red velvet macarons, blueberry muffin and white chocolate raspberry ice cream.   The entire cup was a beautiful sugary sight to behold. We dug in with gusto. I loved the chewy texture of the macaron with the creamy smooth ice cream and fluffy pillowy marshmallow with caramelized crust. We were definitely satisfied and full after sharing it. The cost was $6.25 pre-tax.  Service was very friendly and warm and everyone seemed very happy to be working here. I would be too if I were surrounded with all this delicious bounty!  The location is definitely a bit odd as it's hidden in the back of a shopping plaza right next to a residential area. Thanks to Yelp though we were able to indulge in a unique and tasty collaborative dessert we probably wouldn't have been able to see from the street.  I'll definitely be back again for more delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Yes please. This was just a little hole in the wall with a simple yet delicious idea, add a toasted marshmallow to the top and a macaron. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Have the Fat Daddy with coconut macaroon and pistachio ice cream. Alls I can say is \"WOW\" so good!!! Service is even friendlier and took there time explaining what was what. This is definitely my go to ice cream place!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Their ice cream or whatever it is, is waaaaay too creamy and tasted awkward. I was so excited I saw the great reviews and I was craving some yummy ice cream. Oh well.."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is SOOO GOOD. The Fat Daddy cookie cup is BOMB.   Would I come back? YES.   Food: 5 must get cookie cup! Macaron with melted toasted marshmallow. So god.  Service: 5 a little slow cause there was only one lady. But she was killing it. Price: $"}
{"text":"Fatty daddy's is a small shop in a quiet plaza. I'm from Philadelphia and this would be such a gem with lines wrapped around if it were in the city! Really fun ice cream Flavors and all very yummy. The staff were really friendly and helpful in explaining the flavors and giving my friends and I samples. I got a fatty daddy's and it was so good! Lucky charms ice cream, fruity pebbles macaron, and a perfectly toasted marshmallow. Check in on Yelp for 10% off! Totally worth the price, cool concept, good customer service, delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"For such a unique treat, that I had heard so much about,  I was surprised by the location and inside. The staff was friendly, and the dessert so good, but I didn't feel it was super clean and the ambiance wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great tasting ice cream that offers waffle cone option at a reasonable price. Staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"All I'm saying is - if you go, get the cookie cup. It's two scoops of ice cream, a macaroon, and a freshly toasted marshmallow on top! Decadent! The person working there was polite and friendly. We loved the ice cream - and the price was right. This is a tiny little shop, tucked away near the bike shop facing the street. Basically, you have to be actively looking for it. You don't accidentally stumble upon this place. If I'm back in Scottsdale again I'll be sure to return. A great Yelpy find!"}
{"text":"While I like the name of the place, our overall impression was pretty low. First off, on a Sat night they only had one person working in the shop.  She was busy giving out samples(more on that latter), dolling out ice cream and working the register.  We were unfortunetly stuck behind a large family that neeed to sample just about every flavor before placing an order.  I love the ability to sample a flavor before dropping $6 on a scoop of ice cream, but litterly the sample size was barely there.  Unfortunetly it was enough to stop me from ordering the salted caramel.  I went with the Hazelnut, which was disappoining as well.  We dropped about $30 for the four of us and my in laws another $10 for their order. The consensus opinion is that we should have made the longer drive to Frost!  In addition to the limited selection, slow service (given the lack of staff); the location is not the greatest with limited outdoor seating and even that would be facing the alley or parking lot."}
{"text":"Ok this place was a treat! We are talking the best macaroons I have had, like ever and I go out of my way to try them when I find a place that sells them. If you go here try a couple of their crazy flavors like captain crunch or the popcorn ice cream then order a cookie cup, they will let use a couple flavors in it."}
{"text":"In a random location but great service and dessert. Gotta try the marshmallow with the ice cream. The marshmallows are made in-house. The chocolate malt and hazelnut ice creams are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Excellent ice cream shop tucked right off of McDowell. The macaroon, topped with toasted marshmallow ice cream is unique and make this place a great treat on a hot day. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Had the salted caramel ice cream with an almond flavored macaron and marshmallow. It was good but the ice cream needed a bit more flavor. Really couldn't taste the caramel. Having the toasted marshmallow on top is pretty unique."}
{"text":"First time at Fatty Daddy's and even though it's a 30 minute drive from my house it probably won't be my last. The two girls working were really nice and kept giving me sample after sample of the ice creams they recommended (which all were really good!) then after picking my flavors which were the banana, captain crunch, and morning something ( I forgot the name of the last one) they got my macaroon and marshmallow on top then torch the marshmallow a bit and it was ready! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find so keep an eye for a Carl's Jr, it's right behind it! Next to a paint shop, it doesn't look like there's something there but once you find it you'll have the best macaroon and ice cream sandwich ever! Not to mention the service, which is awesome! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Not the same as it used to be. Although the new owners were nice, it was very disappointing. I hadn't been in a few months (trying to eat better) and for the same price as the original fatty daddy I got a few tiny scoops of ice cream and one cookie. The original fatty daddy was so huge you could share it. I'm glad I got to experience the real thing when it first opened. I'm not sure I'll ever go back. Time to find a new ice cream joint."}
{"text":"I really like this place, coffee was delicious! With a blue berry scone and my daughter enjoyed her strawberry ice cream, i wasn't  too much into ice cream but now they have the most delicious coffee, so if you like coffee and have little ones and big ones too, stop by to enjoy ice cream and coffee and don't forget to try the macaroons!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I really hope they decide to open a location in Queen Creek. We really need an ice cream parlor out here."}
{"text":"I had the single scoop of Salted Caramel and it was interesting. It tasted like a cinnamon roll and not really at all like Caramel.....my husband had the strawberry guava, it was good kinda like a smoothie but not very creamy. This is not a place I would want to come back to. The aesthetic of the place is very interesting."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in the Valley! Must visit. The cookie cups are to die for!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Found Fatty Daddy's on Yelp! after noticing all the great reviews. I have to say, we were not disappointed! The girl behind the counter (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) was super friendly, extremely helpful and really took the time to explain everything and offer samples. Per her suggestion, I opted for the chocolate/coconut mix that tastes just like an Almond Joy (her creation)  with an almond macaroon. I asked her to please toast my marshmallow until it was nice and crispy and she was more than happy to oblige. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, both the food and service were outstanding. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great price and delicious ice cream and toppings. You can really tell the people who work not only take pride in their business, but really love their job and their customers! Hidden gem. Been here several times and never disappointed. One word: go!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Customer service is not the best and the ice cream quality is neutral to me. The dinning was interesting , the wood chairs are way too tall to sit and talk with the person next to you!"}
{"text":"flamer than lit fire flames, squad.  i never thought i would ever enjoy marshmallows, but these guys figured it out. it just works  very inventive ice cream flavors, very congenial service, very baller concept  macaroon + ice cream + macaroon + burnt marshmallow = bing bang boom  strawberry + capn crunch are a happenin' bunch"}
{"text":"Fatty Daddy's is a fun filled small ice cream shop, it's locally owned which is a plus. In the corner of Miller and Scottsdale Rd, hidden next to the bicycle shop, it'll be hard to find but once you walk thru the doors you won't forget the colors. Bright neon pink and blue with local fun colorful artwork by artists here in AZ. What's different between this ice cream shop and cold stone well, you won't find fruity pebbles macaroons or or fun flavored ice cream like a mangonada anywhere else plus if you get the mini daddy or fatty daddy you get a toasted smore perfected for your ice cream . Service is on point from greeting to serving and till ending your service with a smile this is the 2nd time but they comped for the other mistakes I had my first time so it's okay! Definitely come for the macaroons cause it's literally the best thing you tasted! Well guys definitely stay cool here and hungry Arizona !"}
{"text":"This place is really good! It took me awhile to find but i  did find the place. The parking lot is much to be desiered.  The place is small but decent. They were extremely friendly and helpfull in letting me make a choice on what i wanted. I ended up getting cookies and cream, with a red velvet macaron and a toasted marshmellow. Yum! Ive never had a macaron before so this was my first time and i loved it! The toasted marshmellow was to die for.. the outter shell it made and breaking it open to find the gooey fluff just ooze out. Ugh, perfection! I could have had 4 of those on my ice cream and i would have been good to go. I will say they are a bit expensive. Mine came out to $8 which, the ice cream was good, but i dont think its good enough for $8..  Its worth a shot and make sure you use your check in offer!"}
{"text":"I got mint chip and hazelnut chocolate ice cream, with a lemon macaroon and toasted marshmallow and it was soooo good! Portion sizes were perfect imo & staff was friendly. I also like how it's kinda hidden - feels like only locals know about it."}
{"text":"I have only been there once, and I was disappointed. They didn't have any macaroons, and the ice cream looked sparse."}
{"text":"Probably the best ice cream I've ever eaten and I love my ice cream!  The cereal flavors like Fruity Pebbles and Cinnamon Toast Crunch were delicious."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! I really really like this little ice cream shop! I recommend trying something new, that you won't find at other places, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today and loved it. I had the blueberry muffin ice cream (temporarily renamed Purple Rain in honor of Prince) and it was amazing. Perfectly, pleasantly sweet. I also like that they use natural and locally-sourced ingredients! Everyone working here was really nice too."}
{"text":"Tried this place because my coworker suggested it. I had the mini daddy - salted caramel ice cream, vanilla macaroon and toasted marshmallow. The lady who worked there suggested that or the fatty daddy since that's what they are known for. If you want something a little different than your normal ice cream shoppe, try Fatty Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Tasty little hidden gem in Scottsdale! There is absolutely nothing better than a toasted marsh mellow on top of Captain crunch ice cream with captain crunch cereal bites with a caramel macaron. Good variety of ice creams and sorbets. Overall, cute little shop with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow!   Mango gelato, coconut macaroon and a toasted marshmallow!   Wow!  Going to go again!  Betty's combo was chocolate gelato, strawberry macaroon and toasted marshmallow.  We were very happy to see the reviews and it's closer than (now boring) Dairy Queen.   AND supporting a local small biz!      BTW the mango was not just mango flavored... you can tell its made from real mangoes.   YES!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I saw an article in an online mag about the best eats in Phoenix and the macaron ice cream sandwich looked bomb.  I knew it belonged on my Instagram. In reality you only get one macaron, so it is not really a sandwich. I really don't recommend fruity pebble- it was hard and completely tasteless. My husband got coconut and it seemed fresh. There really was a lot of ice cream and the toasted marshmallow on top was the best part. All the other customers were staring and asking what we had. Overall I was disappointed, but might give it another try next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Best ice cream ever!!! I come here at least once a week for their cookie cup and it NEVER disappoints! Staff is super friendly and encourages you to try as many flavors as you want. I've never tried the shakes but my dad always gets the strawberry and swears it's the best he's had. Good location and fantastic ice cream!"}
{"text":"They have a unique twist on ice cream flavors.  I like the chocolate cake batter.  I think one of the owners like concocts different flavors on his own.  If you ever talk to him, he's pretty passionate about his flavors.  They need to consider adding a few more options, and I would recommend on working on curb appeal.  You can easily miss this place driving along McDowell/Miller."}
{"text":"Really good gelato, good service, enjoyed the toasted marshmallow and fruity pebble macaroon.  Definitely worth a visit for something different"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream. The new addition of a hot drinks menu is fantastic! The affoggato is a must try. Fatty Daddys' new owner is really stepping up by providing more of a variety! Great little local spot!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day with my girl and it was really good. Everything they make from scratch. I really liked the fact that the marshmallows were also home made. Everything was tasty the flavors were also really innovative. The sea salt caramel and the Irish whiskey were great. I'd love for them to maybe do more in the future like cookies as an option instead of macrons but those were really tasty as well."}
{"text":"I've had this ice cream place bookmarked ever since it opened. Since I bookmarked it, my son, daughter, and mother have been here multiple times bring all their friends. So I finally made it out here on the weekend with my family (of course they all had to come).   Everyone warned me that it's really hidden and they aren't kidding. It's in the back of some strip mall with a pretty big parking lot but it's not even lit up. Dark.   We walked in and we have two friendly faces just standing there and welcoming us to Fatty Daddy's. Everyone's getting all these samples cause they looked so good.   I just got their cookies and cream ice cream as a mini daddy's cookie cup. So you get one scoop of ice cream with a macaroon on top. To top this off is got the  marshmallow and they torch it to be nice and crispy. It was so darn good. I got the red velvet macaroon. Everything went so well together. Everything was fresh and creamy. Yummy. Yummy.   My daughter and mom never got the cookie cup before and followed my lead. They all love it. My son of course had to get the Fatty Daddy cookie cup which has two scoops with a macaroon in between and on top of the cup with of course an added marshmallow (that is a must).   They have seating inside and outside to enjoy this little treat. It just seems like there is a stream of people always coming in. Non-stop. For a hidden gem, everyone knows about this place.   They have friendly service with so many options for the cookie cup. Fresh, creamy and down right good. Of course I'll be back to try another flavor but not too often cause that would mean the gym everyday. Just glad it's on the other side of town so I can control myself. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars but the person who paid for me may give it less...the ice cream, cookie, marsh mallow combo is absolutely genius. Slightly expensive but honestly it's pretty unique and innovative so it's worth the extra few bucks."}
{"text":"Fatty Daddy's is tucked away in an unassuming, small plaza that is colorful, fun and oh-so-delicious! One of the only places that does a Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich Bowl. They have fun flavors inspired by my favorite childhood cereals to ethnic combinations such as Chile Mango. FD is reminiscent of the flavors that can be found with Melt but is still different in its own way.  I always opt for the Mini Daddy, as it ain't so mini and is the perfect amount of ice cream (2 scoops) sandwiched between crisp and chewy macaron cookies and topped with a scorched marshmallow. I always get my second scoop in a flavor that compliments a cereal-flavored ice cream, as I feel this goes well with the cookie as well as the sweet, vanilla flavor of the marshmallow. The ice cream is so creamy, rich and doesn't melt too quickly.  The service here is so friendly and the workers treat you well. They give great recommendations and don't shy to have a taste test or two of the flavors. There is a good amount of seating with fun walls to look at indoors as well as a few seats and tables out front. Decent pricing ($6.50) for delicious dessert complete with macaron cookies and a toasted to order marshmallow and two scoops of ice cream!  Check-in on Yelp for 10% off your purchase here! They also use your phone number so you may rack up points for discounts in the future. No more fumbling around for frequent buyer cards!"}
{"text":"Delicious macaroons and amazing ice cream flavors! I love the blueberry muffin ice cream and the Captain Crunch ice cream! For around 5 or 6 bucks you get a great amount of ice cream and the awesome macaroons, so I definitely recommend going here. Compared to other ice cream places you have to spend a lot more to get the same portion they serve here so it's a great deal. My family and I have been there a couple times now and the owners are friendly."}
{"text":"Really great place to go came in got some ice cream with the fiancee. Kimmy behind the counter was very sweet and nice. She was very helpful with letting us try some samples  before purchasing which was a really cool. Definitely check this spot out when you are in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Just tried Fatty Daddy's, the ice cream is AWESOME. We will definitely be back. There is a great variety of unusual flavors we liked every one we tried. They have a cookie cup that is my new favorite. We will be back."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop does have some neat flavors to choose from like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Mango but it is simply just a good scoop of ice cream, nothing spectacular. I had a cookie added to mine for their signature macaron ice cream sundaes but sadly the cookie was just the top half of it and it tasted stale."}
{"text":"Stoped by for post dinner desert at this little place in the back of the plaza...you bacially have to get their special...you get scoops of one flavor of ice cream and 1 macaroon on top and one flamed marshmallow that they do in front of you...no choice!!!"}
{"text":"What a neat and unique spin on my two favorite sweet treats: ice cream and macarrons!   I had the Red Velvet and Fruit Loop flavored macarrons with Netflix and Chill (butter flavored with chocolate covered pretzels and peanuts) /cherry pistachio.   So good and perfect! The portion size is great for two people while the price is nice ($6). Oh, cannot forget the fact that they top the Cookie Cup with a Fluff It toasted marshmallow! Divine and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I finally decided to stop in and try this place as ice cream in this hellacious hot weather sounded fantastic. We were not disappointed. We shared the Mini Daddy, consisting of a scoop of fudgesicle, a scoop of Nutella, a caramel macaron and a large toasted marshmallow. Heaven! It's within walking distance of our home. Yay! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area you def must stop by. Don't skip the macaroon or marshmallow, you'll regret it!"}
{"text":"Gelato flavors all looked great. Sampled Mango Habanero and Whiskey Irish Cream, both delicious! Went with a cookie cup of Irish cream, an almond macaroon and the freshly toasted mallow. Truly great mix of flavors and just enough to be satisfying."}
{"text":"I wish the ice cream choices were less watery! I was so confused cause this place had five stars on Yelp!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall ice cream shop is fresh and gorgeous. The store is lined with gorgeous art prints for sale. Try Purple Rain, formerly known as Blueberry Muffin. It is far away from me, but definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Was in the hood and in the mood for ice cream  Saw Fatty Daddy's pop up on a friend's Bookmarked list and was having dinner down the road. Worth a stop!  Ice cream flavors here are cool-- Lucky Charms, Cherry Amareto, Netflix and Chill, and on and on... Very creamy and the butterfat makes for a smooth spoonful. The Cookie cups looked amazing, but we decided to skip since we were so full from dinner. Raincheck!  It's a small shop with lots of staff and a good amount of sitting area. It is on the backside of a shopping area, off the major road, though. Don't panic when your nav leads you around the corner, seemingly away from where the shop should be. It's only yards away."}
{"text":"The grand opening was something special. It was great to see the community get behind and support this local small business. I had the famous Cookie Cup with banana and coconut sandwiched between two soft and chewy coconut macaroons, and it did not disappoint. It even had a toasted marshmallow on top. I saw cups with flavors like movie night, captain crunch, cinnamon toast crunch, grape pineapple, and so many  individual toppings. I wanted to try all of their custom flavors but there wasn't enough time or room in my stomach. The shakes that they were serving looked amazing and I'll be trying one on my next visit while I create my next custom cookie cup."}
{"text":"So friendly and so patient as my husband wanted to sample about eight flavors before settling on one. I ordered the Cookie Cup (cherry ice cream, almond macaron)- the marshmallow was heavenly!  I recommend getting one scoop and adding a marshmallow, as the Cookie Cup was way too much ice cream.  Kind of difficult to find- but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The place is a little hard to find, but the ice cream here is amazing! I definitely recommend the Fruity Pebble and Nutella flavor. It was super creamy and delicious. I wasn't hungry enough for the \"Cookie Cup\", but I am going to try it next time.   The Cookie Cup is essentially 2 flavors of ice cream, choice of a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top. All for $6.50!"}
{"text":"I found this place looking up \"ice cream\" here on Yelp. The Cookie Daddy was what drew my friend and I in so we headed over! The location was hard to find at first but we realized it was hidden in the building behind Chruch's. I ordered the Cookie Daddy with chocolate hazelnut ice cream, a vanilla macaroon, and of course, the marshmallow. The ice cream and macaroon were unbelievably delicious and the genuine flavor was the best part. As for the marshmallow, it (obviously) tasted artificially toasted which I didn't entirely enjoy, but overall the ice cream was incredible (hence why I ate it so fast and forgot to take a picture). Also, I believe all their ice cream (besides the cereal ones) are egg and soy free and organic which you can't beat. Check this place out if you can!"}
{"text":"I saw friends' posts about this place on IG and bookmarked it a while back.  When my friend and I were looking for a place with dessert and were close by, we headed over.  As many people have said, this place is tucked away and hard to spot.  There is no signage.  We were literally sitting in the parking lot looking at the map trying to find it.  When we looked up we saw the door and realized it was right in front of us.   There was only one worker at the time and there was a group of 5 before us, so there was a bit of a wait.  The worker was friendly and let us try many of the flavors.  It was worth the wait.  The macaron was okay.  If it wasn't with the ice cream and marshmallow, I would have thought it was too dry.  But the toasted marshmallow from fluff it marshmallows was the deal breaker.  It took a while for him to toast both of them, but it was so good and worth it!"}
{"text":"Fun little ice cream stop. What could beat 3 desserts in one? House-made and Toasted marshmallow (to your perfect degree of liking) + a macaron (not to be confused with the coconutty macaroon) + two scoops of your favorite house-made ice cream. Yum!! The ice cream is quite smooth and creamy while still light on the palate. So many great flavors to choose from including passion fruit sweet cream, cookies 'n cream, coffee and many more. I really enjoyed this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The cookie bowl was amazing a must have dessert. The toasted marshmallow was the best part. I might make a special trip back just to get some of their homemade marshmallows to take home."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. But with the new management I don't enjoy the environment anymore."}
{"text":"I love the energy and the customer service at Fatty Daddy's. We arrived about 15 minutes to closing (ooops!) With a group of eight . . .the staff were stoked! Even if they were anxious to get out and enjoy their evening, I would have never known.  I would estimate each of us sampled at least three different flavors before choosing our options. The selection is great and if you skip on the toasted marshmallow, then you're missing out.  My only piece of advice . . . I ordered the Morning Madness and the Nutella flavor. The vanilla scoop was placed on the BOTTOM of the cup, rather than on top of my Nutella... waahhhhhh!!!! It was a rookie mistake, but vanilla goes on the top!  I'll certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love that the concept is different with the macaron and marshmallow! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place would have received 2 stars if not for the ice cream. Grandma's cookie flavor was great! What I didn't like were the macarons and the marshmallow. The cookies were too dense and chewy to be considered macarons. The issue with the marshmallow was that it was extremely gummy and made it hard to bite off, it tasted stale. The portion was decent but still expensive. I was excited to try this place and was disappointed. I probably won't be back when there are many other ice cream shops that offer better products at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"That toasted marshmallow is the most beautiful think I've ever saw and it tasted great!  I'm rating it 5 stars just for that beautiful toasted marshmallow.   Remember, you can get the marshmallow without the cookie cup!"}
{"text":"Capt. Crunch Ice Cream with a toasted 'mallow was  I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a unique ice cream joint."}
{"text":"Came in the other night because I was really craving some ice cream, I came in with my son and wife she got their signature cookie cup and my son got a kids scoop, while I got a double scoop on a waffle cone. when the the little girl rang us up I almost had a heart attack because it was almost   20 dollars!! I understand it's local, however  I find it to be super pricey. The salted caramel flavor was really good however I found the fruity pebble to be super bland and forgettable. The service and ambience are nice. However if you're not rich I'd say there are probably way more cost effective options with great quality as well. I won't say I'm not coming back, but honestly if I do it will be far and between."}
{"text":"HOME OF THE (almost famous) COOKIE CUP.   Instagram pictures don't do it justice. The cookie cup is a giant chewy macaron with two scoops of ice cream, toppings, and additional locally made toasted marshmellow. The ice cream is soft, creamy, and amazing. We were recommended to get their cereal ice creams (fruit loops, captain crunch, cinnamon toast crunch) I loved it, only thing I didn't like was the actual cereal bits because they got soggy, but the flavor was spot on! We ordered cinnamon toast crunch and green tea in a red velvet macaron with a toasted marshmellow for ~$6. Sharing is advisable because of size, but I'd completely understand if you don't want to.   Oh my goodness is this guilty sugar overload, but I would be more than happy to come back over and over and over.   The store is small and kind of hidden away in the shopping plaza behind Church's chicken. The owner was so sweet and helpful. The grand opening will be hosted, so keep you eyes out for the ads!  I highly recommend this place to everyone in the area & I only hope for the best for this shop :)"}
{"text":"Moved out to Phoenix. Found this place on pinterest, I was just looking for dessert spots one day. Its literally, a whole in the wall. They have this macaroon marshmallow ice cream that is ,delicious. I love it. Family owned spot they are super friendly. They have unique and amazing flavors. If you like spicy sweet flavors, try the mango habanero. Soo bomb."}
{"text":"The cookie cup is like a Picasso masterpiece.  No 2 are alike, but they are all so special!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place, we wanted to check it out since we were finally in the area. It was pretty dead around 1:30pm on a Saturday, but there was plenty of parking as it's kind of a hole in the wall place.   I noticed they had boba so I got a black milk tea, and we also got a cookie cup.. which consisted of an ice cream flavor of your choice, a macaron, and a marshmallow on top. We chose strawberry sorbet and a vanilla macaron, of course topped with the marshmallow which they \"toast\" for you with a mini blowtorch.   The boba tea was pretty average. I've had much better and wouldn't recommend getting it here, but it was still drinkable and fine. The cookie cup was okay.. the marshmallow was really good but the rest was just average. Nothing special taste wise.   I will say, I love the name of this place, and the novelty of the cookie cup is pretty cool (especially for those who like to instagram their food) but I just don't see myself coming back, unless someone else wants to."}
{"text":"Super good ice cream! Went here last night at around 9 for the first time after finding this place on Yelp. Didn't have to wait too long in the line, less than 5 minutes which was great. The ice cream is super super good, the fruity pebble macaroon definitely tastes like fruity pebbles and the marshmallow they torch for you is so good with the ice cream. Right when I left around 9:30 there was a line out the door so it definitely does get busy! Personally I wouldn't get a macaroon again just because I wasn't huge on the texture but I definitely will be returning to try more flavors of the ice cream!"}
{"text":"I have to update my last review. The last review was when they were completely out of cookies and low on ice cream. I went today and OH MY. So delicious and I can't wait to go back and share the experience. I ordered Captain Crunch ice cream, a fruity pebbles macaroon and toasted marshmallow. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Shocking that this place has 4 1/2 stars.  They are not only pricey but their scoops are so small. When press the ice cream in the cup, it's half the size of the cup. Some of their flavors like captain crunch and habanero mango might be different but they are not good at all. This was our first time here but definitely our last. Frost is the place to go."}
{"text":"Unique flavors and awesome service! It's amazing!!!! Tucked away on McDowell, but worth the drive!"}
{"text":"It's right behind churches chicken. It's hidden near the back. Limited seats. Very small inside.  Yessssss. Steve urkel picture was everything. Haha I had the red velvet macaroon with mocha java and mint chocolate chip ice cream in between and a square marshmallow on top. Whoooooooo. Bombbbb. Ohh, Try the foot loop and the lucky charm as well."}
{"text":"I drove up on a Tuesday at 6:30pm from Chandler. Easy drive and easy to find. I opted for a waffle cone with Banana, and Mint Chip scoops. The ice cream itself was good; not too sweet, didn't give me indigestion, and was overall good quality. The cone was good, too; light and crispy. My only complaint was that the scoops were extremely small for the price. Overall it was good and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh whoa, there's a new creamery in town, and it's better than the other ones.   Despite failing to pick a Scottsdale-friendly name, Fatboy Dadbod's is killing the game.  Peanut butter and chocolate were the highlights of our sampling bender, with coffee, pistachio, and mint chip ranking as noteworthy, as well. Across the board, texture was consistently on point.   The shtick is a macaron and blow-torched marshmallow atop your ice cream, which is novel AND enjoyable, so I'll toss it two thumbs up.   Besides, delivering the goods without an ounce of pretentious nonsense gets my vote over Le Boujii Créamêrí any day."}
{"text":"The mango flavor of ice cream is the best, but lets be real here people, we all come for the macaroon and stay for the roasted marshmallows. I just wish the macaroon has been fresher tasting."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall location serving up unique flavors of ice cream and sorbets.  I had the Morning Mess and had a Fruity Pebbles macaron on  top of that.  Awesome sauce."}
{"text":"The girl serving today was very rude. The ice cream was ok, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is fantastico! The hubby and I wanted a little something sweet late at night and thank goodness this place is just in our neighborhood. I had the captain crunch ice cream with a delicious toasted marshmallow on top. This brought me back to my childhood days when we would make s'mores with the kids in our neighborhood. My hubby had the chocolate gelato and peanut butter ice cream. He was wowed on how great everything tastes. The owner \"fat daddy\" was there and we complimented his idea and ice cream creations. Definitely coming back! Wish the outside parking was more lit up."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Amazing ice cream, macaron and marshmallows!! The service was friendly super helpful!"}
{"text":"Tasty small batch ice cream! Macaroons are huge! Great customer service - check it out! She has sorbet too!"}
{"text":"Friendly hello as soon has my 12 year old and I walked in even though there was a line of people 6 deep...way to go fatty's! A little bit pricy...maybe, but my large berry shake with whipped cream was spot on...yes!  Go and check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"I visited this place this past Sunday night with my roommate because we were craving something sweet. It was a little hard to find at first because the area isn't well lit, but it's behind Church's chicken. The place was pretty cute and had a lot customers, in my opinion, for a Sunday night ~8 pm. The lady was really nice and let us have  samples to try. I decided to get the sweet cream and passion fruit because of the sample. When I got a cup it tasted more sweet cream than passion fruit. It was still hit the spot. I got a kids scoop, and I thought the portion was generous.   My roommate got the Cookie Cup which is what the place is known for and she loved it. The lady toasted the marshmallow in front of us. I'm not sure if I'll get it. It seemed a little overpriced to me. The place had lot of unique flavors that I would be willing to come back for though."}
{"text":"A little difficult location to find, but once we arrive we knew it would be a great time!   The flavors of ice cream are amazing and there's a great variety. We went with \"mini daddy's\" and still left satisfied. The price is reasonable for this decadent (and clinically insane) dessert and shows for a great treat during summer!   Leaving very happy!"}
{"text":"I want so badly to give this place a 5 star rating!!! It was off the beaten path, quaint and adorable! The staff was super friendly and all of the ice creams were incredible!!! I was in absolute heaven!! Then I found a hair IN the ice cream, not like it fell onto my cone, but half way through my delicious scoop of peanut butter. I was super grossed out and so sad because it was so yummy! I just couldn't get passed it, yucky!"}
{"text":"There's a good chance you may contract diabeetus from this place, but it's probably worth it. The people who work here are really nice and provide superb customer service."}
{"text":"My go-to ice cream place in Scottsdale! No one does it quite like them! You have to come here and get a fat daddy to truly understand but even if you just got one scoop of ice cream you would be hooked! Their captain crunch ice cream is my personal favorite, but all of their flavors are out of sight! If you are having a sweet tooth craving stop by here. I found them on Yelp and my bet is if you are reading this you just found them on Yelp too!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream around. Had chocolate birthday cake with a red velvet macaroon and homemade marshmallow.  Omg.  I meant to give it 5 stars.  Not one  debbie"}
{"text":"Loved the flavors. I loved Irish cream had to do that with fruity pebbles macaroon and toasted with a small coffee. My hubby went for Cinnamon Toast Crunch with fruity pebbles macaroon and toasted marshmallow. They are on par with other dessert prices don't know what all the gripe is about."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking around the park. According to the lady, the ice cream here is made with organic milk. I didn't get a fancy dessert as I was having dinner in 2 hours but I can attest this ice cream is among the best I've had. It's creamy and importantly not colored. (I always check if the mint chip is green or white.)  Bonus: they have green tea and an excellent mango habanero for ice cream flavors, and bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl with my family and boyfriend last weekend and was on a mission for a good dessert following a day full of tailgating and apps. Yelped and found Fatty Daddy's and was sold when I saw the toasted marshmallows and macaroons! Garrett was working and he hooked my brothers, my bf and I with amazing gelato! I had a combo of malted milk ball and coconut gelato topped with a caramel macaroon and it was heaven. My bf liked his so much he ordered a second one! Long story short if you're ever in Phoenix, go here!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my last visit. The sample I got of taste the rainbow seemed pretty good but as I ate my cookie bowl I got an overwhelming flavor of key lime flavoring to the point where my friend and I had to throw it away and he never wants to come back."}
{"text":"We got word of this place from my cousin.  We drove up and thought 'uh oh.  Did we come to the right place.'   Short answer.  Yes.  I had the cookie cup with a double dose of fruity pebbles.  Both the gelato and the macaroon.  But the marshmallow was a total surprise.  Don't turn away because it's in a crazy strip mall in the middle of a neighborhood.  Go in and indulge.  Everything is home made and made to order."}
{"text":"Awesome flavor options!!!!  We opted for captain crunch fatty daddy. Loved the ice cream and marshmallow but didn't love the macaroons.   Will for sure be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Not great - we went here because The PussyCat gelato place was closed (holiday). We had been to the PussyCat gelato place in Old Towne last night and it was amazing. Sorry Fatty Daddy's but your gelato is too sweet - like it's made from a pre-made mix. Toppings didn't help. The skimpy scoop was hollow inside."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey buts totally worth it.. bomb.com, I will for sure come again and I come all the way from buckeye and it's worth the drive thumps up.."}
{"text":"This place is really fun!  It's tucked away in a little strip center(?) (I don't know what you call it) that doesn't look like it would contain an icecream shop, so you have to keep sharp eyes out to spot it.  For non-dairy eaters like me they have a surprising amount of options!  The day I went they had 5 dairy-free sorbets that were so delicious.  I ended up getting half passionberry and half strawberry moscato, yum!  The coconut macaron on top was sooo sweet, but in a good way.  I liked how the outside of the macaron was crispy and the inside was a bit gooey.  The torched marshmallow on top put this dessert over the top!  There is little more that I love in this world than toasted marshmallow.  I'll definitely be back for more sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Rupert Grint's first ambition was to be an \"Ice Cream Man\" and he bought an ice cream truck with the money he earned from Harry Potter movies.  One trip out to Fatty Daddy's and I'm an instant fan.  Linh L. and I have been wanting to stop in after seeing Chris H.'s drool-worthy pics. After a great St. Paddy's Day lunch, we made the trek over only to find out that they were out of the delish macarons cookies. What!? I threatened to drive my foot through the ice cream display case and told them tables were about to be flipped! Luckily, it was delivery day for cookies and they made a call to see where they were. \"It'll take about 20mins for the cookies to get here.\" Cool. So we decided to wait and time flew by as we got to taste almost all of the 20+ ice cream flavors and we sang along and made up new lyrics to Hozier's \"Take Me To Church.\"  After a brief wait, they were here! MACARONS! I made a cookie cup out of Fruity Pebbles macarons with Lucky Charms ice cream, added rainbow sprinkles for more color, topped with a colored vanilla marshmallow! Did you know that the marshmallows comes from Fluff It in Gilbert, made specifically for them with the colorful swirls? The macarons are also specially made for them from Twelve Cake Bakery. The macarons are formulated and made to their liking so if you ever ordered from Twelve Cake Bakery, it wouldn't be the same --- which is truly a pity because it's perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. As for that ice cream, whoa! Everything I tried really tasted authentic to their flavor and the whole shebang isn't teeth-rottingly sweet. It was seriously perfect!  So yes, the cookie cup is AMAZING. The staff [especially Paco] is so friendly and are full of laughter. The shop itself is adorable with all their bold colors and fun artwork (some even for sale!). I definitely will be back, Fatty Daddy's! My skirt flips for that cookie cup!  Note to self: Get the Mangonada with Chamoy. Yaaas!"}
{"text":"I would have tried every single flavor if there weren't 20 people in line behind me. This place is amazing! Their flavors are unique and awesome! I tried as many as I could and every one was so good... Nutella, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, \"movie night,\" Red velvet... All delicious. I ended up getting their \"cookie cup\" cause I'm obsessed with macarons and it didn't disappoint! It had a couple scoops of blueberry muffin ice cream with a scoop of peanut butter ice cream and a vanilla macaroon, topped with a marshmallow they torch right before handing you your heaven in a cup. Honestly, if you're an ice cream fanatic, give this place a try. Even if you're not, you should still check it out! ;) A few people in front of me got shakes that also looked amazing."}
{"text":"The ice cream looks great in pictures. That and the good reviews got us to choose this as our dessert spot for the night. The service was good, we got to try a few of the flavors before making a decision.   We decided to share a cup with salted caramel and the cherry swirl (I think that's what it was called) flavors which were then topped with a coconut macaron and a toasted marshmallow. It looked really great! Eating the ice cream wasn't as great because the macaron was rock solid and hard to get through with our spoons. The ice creams were also very sweet, make sure you have a cup of water next to you!"}
{"text":"Super nice lady at the counter. Lots of great and different flavors but pretty forgettable taste. I had the hazelnut with marshmallow topping and an almond macaroon. It was just ok....nothing special. The boy got coconut ice cream and a coconut macaroon and loved it. We also took a red velvet macaroon home and enjoyed it later. It was all pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is a small, possibly difficult place to find, ice cream shop especially if you don't know the neighborhood. It is located in the back of a small commercial building. They are known for their marshmallow and macaroon toppings but we just got a small cup with 3 flavors. The peanut butter was very peanutty and delicious and the Irish Cream definitely meets expectations. The chocolate chip, although good, could certainly use more chips. Our only disappointment was with having such a the wide variety of flavors they didn't have chocolate. We asked but the girl behind the counter wasn't very talkative and really didn't respond she just smiled. But it is a great place to go for a homemade ice cream fix."}
{"text":"Ice cream is over priced and they advertise macaroons that they rarely have. The location is very hidden so make sure you pay attention. There isn't much signage."}
{"text":"This was a surprising find in the most unexpected location. It's a hidden gem well Worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Delish little spot with fresh ice cream and hold the phone... sorbet!!! And loads of flavors too. The mango sorbet was superb and their little sitting area was nice. You have to come around off McDowell to get here but it is worth it."}
{"text":"We came in at 9pm when they close at 9:30... And it was a wonderful experience. The staff were not annoyed by our presence, but instead, cheerful and very accommodating. As it was our first time here, we tried several flavors (yes, I mean SEVERAL) before deciding on coffee, cinnamon toast crunch and salted caramel. We got the \"cookie cup\" (the mini daddy) and it consisted of 2 scoops of ice cream, a macaron and a toasted marshmallow on top. It. Was. Delicious. I would have gotten the fruity pebbles ice cream (also bomb) but just was in the mood for the cinnamon toast crunch. They have many flavors of wonderfully chewy macarons as well, some in stock and others not. Wanted to try almond but they were out, so I had coconut and it was quite tasty. The flavor was subtle snd didn't overpower the ice cream. We decided to sit outside on their little front patio and enjoyed our cookie cups under the hanging lights. Delightful. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I've only had this once while visiting in Arizona but I'm still thinking about my foodsperience. Super friendly staff. Unlimited samples until you find the perfect ice-cream flavor for your concoction. The macaron was warm light and has that soft crunch when you dig into it through the toasted marshmallow (toasted right in front of you with a small torch). I had the mini which was not sandwiched on the bottom and top by a macaron, only the top which is a perfect portion for me. Some may say it's pricey but when you buy a macaron alone at a bakery is about $2 or more. Wish I lived near-by! Until next time!  (fruity pebble macaron, nom nom)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem! I had the mini cookie cup with cookies and cream ice cream, a red velvet macaron, and a toasted marshmallow. I am not even a marshmallow fan but I loved it! Great customer service too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place to finish up my night in Scottsdale! I've been wanting to come here since many of my friends on yelp had been here within the past few months. The photos look so delicious that I almost wanted to lick it off my phone. After dining out in downtown Scottsdale, we've decided to stop by here.  Service was outstanding and welcoming. They allowed us to try any flavor ice-cream that we wanted. Basically, you get to pick any ice-cream flavor of your choice. Then, they put two macarons (many flavor to choose from) top with a delicious mashmellow on the top of it. Once the mashmellow is melted, it tastes so much better.   Not only I love the presentation, it is very tasty. Ill definitely come back here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little corner market is a cute little ice cream shop.  When I first moved to Scottsdale, I didn't live very far from here and i could see myself walking over here to have lovely treats and often.  Now, as you look for this place, don't blink, because if you do, you will miss it.  It is not facing Miller Street, but faces the parking lot north of the building.  (I did say tucked away...)    I am not a person for sweets, but the kids that I took here LOVED it.  The loved the optional toppings, specifically the marshmallow.  I enjoyed the macarons!  They were deliciously sweet and tasty.  Return FActor: 65%"}
{"text":"What a find! Try the blueberry ice cream. Just like a blueberry muffin yummy  also had the mocha Java yaya and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Really great tasting custom made icecream. Super impressed with how creative they are with their flavored that are switched out weekly and loved that the staff was friendly, welcoming, and well versed in their product so they could inform a new customer like me what's best to try."}
