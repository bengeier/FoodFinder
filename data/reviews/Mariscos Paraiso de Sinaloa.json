{"text":"Not sure what happened to the old place apparently they sold to this company. Went in there looking for great Mexican food and all I got was a ton of seafood which I don't like. Ended up finding a burrito, it was decent, Carne Asada was a little old. The little girl waitress was rude and didn't really give a shit. Place was empty. Probably won't last long. Miss the old place."}
