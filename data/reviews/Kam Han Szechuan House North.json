{"text":"We are glad we decided to try this place, it's been renovated, nice and quiet. Tried a couple dishes, funny name on the menu and dishes are surprising. You gotta try yourself. Will recommend to someone wants to try real Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best Quality Szechuan food in the city.  No MSG.  I have been going there for 20 years; always consistently top-notch food.  Never a disappointment.  My favorite is the salt and pepper squid."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. AVOID at ANY COST! 3 rounds of nagging from their manager, for a 3 dollar ginger ale. So I took a Ginger Ale from their fridge which sits besides me, with a glass door. I went to the counter and said \"I took a ginger ale, can I have 2 glasses?\" Somehow the manager turned angry and gave me a speech of \" DO not taking anything from the fridge\". \"OK, OK\" then I went back to my table.  Minutes later the manager came with the glasses, surprisingly she gave me and my friend another educational speech of \"ordering from us, not from the fridge\". Awesome, I love getting educated! After we finished dinner and went to pay, there she is again! Another speech. OMG I'm so fed up, not by the food but all the nagging she serviced."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The price was great. Went for lunch and had the lunch special. Excellent fried rice, ginger beef, wonton soup and dumplings. The dumplings are hand rolled and some of the best I've ever had.  Also had some sweet and spicy soup and it was fantastic. The service was really fast and the staff were very kind and helpful. I highly suggest this place.  It fills up fast so get there early!"}
{"text":"Date Night dinner began with deep fried wontons, followed by Szechuan Noodles, Ginger Fried Beef & Sweet n Sour Pork. Everything was great except the wontons. I'm sorry but they're enormous and contained a green pea sized piece of pork and NOTHING else. This was particularly disappointing because they also jacked up the prices since we last visited. Booooo!"}
{"text":"Lunch here first time in years. Portions for the special were large enough for me I took leftovers home. Had the wonton soup, spring roll, most of the s&s chicken, and some of the fried rice, taking the rest home. Pork fried rice FYI. Everything was great. Good tea too. I'll be returning more often."}
{"text":"Everything about dining here was awesome. The establishment is very modern and very clean. The staff are all very friendly and very prompt. A lot of places like this you might get one or two dishes that miss the mark but not here. Every single dish we had was fantastic. We will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"This used to be our favourite place, when owned by the previous owner.  We went at least every two weeks for years.  We even kept going for a while with the new owners.  Recently however, we decided to order take-away.  When we ordered, they said they wouldn't honour the special that was advertised on our recently delivered flyer.  They also wouldn't honour the 10% cash discount, also advertised on their take-away menu.  When I asked why not, they started to get nasty on the phone and said they didn't want customers who were difficult.  Seriously???  This is how they treat long-term loyal customers?    Never again."}
{"text":"I'm aiming at 3.5 stars. The food is delicious (but not exceptional) and the service was very good. The vegetables were fresh and perfectly prepared. I thought the restaurant itself wasn't clean enough -- we were in a booth and the table/wall interface had a bunch of food trapped in it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Ramsay. They have the typical Chinese dishes you should expect, ginger beef, general tso, etc. They also have some much more interesting dishes if you dine in. The owners are very friendly and passionate. The restaurant is humble, but the food is impressive."}
{"text":"My friend took me here last night, cuz she knew I love fish, and this restaurant made great baked fish/crab. But I have shellfish allergies, so we didn't try the crab. I would say it's perfect if it wasn't that salty, but ummm I think if we ordered the crab, it wouldn't be as salty as the fish. Anyway, I would totally recommend this restaurant. I rated 5 stars not just because of the food, it's more about the experience, who I dined with. Love her & wish her all the best"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  While Chinese-owned, wouldn't go out of my way saying it's a must-go restaurant, but it's clean, above average taste.  With its current location in a residential area (but Spiller is a somewhat big road), I would say they cater more to the western market.  But i'll digress.  Ordered the honey garlic spareribs, because one, it's the safest to measure against, and two, it did smell good in the air when I walked in.  Like I mentioned, it's not bad, above average, and would consider eating again.  By the time you leave the tax, tip, and now it's over $18.    Exterior-wise, looks like a hut, with its parking lot.  Friendly service.  They deliver.  And accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Terrible food. They give you a teacup size plate. Everything was cold and also overpriced. They even charged for Chinese tea which should be complimentary.  They couldn't even offer a dessert or something for a special Birthday celebration. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I described this to friends as ordering a pepperoni/mushroom pizza, and getting sausage/onion, but finding it was still really good. Same thing for this place--None of the dishes I ordered followed the traditional recipe, but they were still pretty good. Sweet/Sour Soup: Was neither sweet nor sour and had a gravy-like brown broth instead of the typical red vinegar influenced broth, but it was still good. Gong Bao Ji Ding (Emperor's Chicken or something) was sweet and sour chicken. But they were nice people, the food was tasty and it was plentiful."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kam Han for about 10 years and absolutely love their food.  While its definitely westernized Chinese cuisine its heads and shoulders above every other similar restaurant.  I live a good 40 minutes away and I happily make the drive!  The restaurant itself is always quite clean and the staff very friendly & attentive.  They have a very large menu and always a few daily specials.  The last  visit there we had a good mix.  Started with the hot & sour soup, then the pan fried wontons (these are AMAZING little bundles of flavor...not your normal wontons), house special steamed rice, chicken with beans and spicy szechuan beef.  The soup was loaded with all sorts of good stuff.  Rice similarly packed with vegetables, egg and chicken.  The mains were freshly cooked to order and oh so tasty!  I don't want to end on a negative not but it should be worth mentioning that the Kam Han in Avenida Place might share a name but thats about it.  Have been there a few times and their food was always disappointing.   Stick to the location on Spiller Road and you'll be happy (and full!)."}
{"text":"Very good!! It's one of the best Chinese foods I have had in Calgary !! The portions are really good! You'll be filled for sure and you can even take some food to go if you don't eat that much! We ordered the menu for 6 people and it was a lot of food! All delicious!! I would definitely go back there on a day I'll be hungry enough to enjoy all that great food! My only complain is that wine was not very good.. but the food was great !!"}
