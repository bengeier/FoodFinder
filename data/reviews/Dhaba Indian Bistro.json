{"text":"The atmosphere, service and food was absolutely amazing. I ordered lamb masala, chicken tikka masala and paneer for an appetizer. All of the food was very flavorful and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I stopped at Dhaba for the first time this week.  On the good side, the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient.  Also, our naan bread was delicious.  On the bad side, the very bad side, the lamb vindaloo was inedible.  It appeared to be canned tomato soup, slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in.  Terrible!  The chicken tikka masala was barely passable.  I think the sauce also came from a jar, at least it tasted like it.  

I cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan.  If you want Indian, any other Indian restaurant in town would be better."}
{"text":"The beef curry was great, the lamb was perfect. The blend of spices was just right. For my first time eating Indian I am very impressed. The staff here is great. Very clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous.  Waiters were very nice and attentive.  The garlic Naan was very tasty as were the two other curries we ordered.  They will serve your food spiced to order.   I'm not fond of super hot food, but we ordered ours at a \"three\" and that was perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing, promptly prepared food.  Great service.

Order the food with at least mild spice, or else you may find the dishes a little bland.  Our whole table agreed on that."}
{"text":"Best tasting food and that's coming from a hyderabadi. It was a heavenly experience. We drove ways out and were quite skeptic of the place but it took us by surprise. Very clean and immaculate interior. The area was lively with about a dozen art pieces on the wall. Staff is very courteous. I don't want to talk of food anymore as I want to go there now. All in all a very happy experience for my tummy and my heart. See you soon dhaba!"}
{"text":"By far the top Indian food restaurant I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.  The food in on point with flavor and you could not ask for a friendlier staff.  I encourage anyone who enjoys a good Indian dish to try this place, as it will go to the top of your list as it did mine."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7pm on 2/14 and were seated after 10 minute wait.  Seemed like the staff were a bit disorganized.  Our drink order was taken immediately and food order not much later.  Food was average, definitely not as good as Maharaja on Odana Rd.  I had lamb mango with a spice level 4/5.  It was much better cold for leftovers the next day after the spices had a chance to meld.  The service was poor.  We didn't get a water refill until after we had eaten appetizers and our meals.  A lady at a table near us had a scarf fall from the back of her chair, and wait staff walked on it at least twenty times without bothering to pick it up or at least avoid walking in it.

Bottom line: would I go back?  Probably, if it were a group decision.  Not likely for just the two of us, though."}
{"text":"This is a very welcome addition to the Greenway Blvd area. I work in the area and truly excited about this awesome new option. Honestly, I was prepared to be disappointed (Bison Jacks, ahem), but I was happily impressed! I'd recommend this placed to anyone. Worth driving out of the way if you don't work or live nearby. Very gracious and attentive service, delicious food, and lunch menu pricing is surprisingly reasonable= 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Dhaba's has good service and good food. And they hit the spice level nicely, as requested. We usually order mild, and the food comes out mild, but still very tasty. When we order medium-spicy, the heat level definitely goes up, but not too much; and everyone always agrees that the spice level is solidly in the range of medium-spicy.

We only select from their vegetarian options (I have only eaten with other vegetarians at Dhaba's). All of their dishes have been great! We especially like their paneer options."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty busy, but the service was still quite good. The  menu is quite large, with lots of great curry options. Chicken Madras was excellent, but the cheese naan wasn't great."}
{"text":"Excellent food, best Indian in Madison that I've had
Nice place
great service
awesome prices"}
{"text":"We tried this for lunch on a Saturday. We were the first people to arrive for lunch a little after 11 AM. The server didn't mention the specials...we saw them on the way out. We ordered appetizers that appeared to be reheated a bit, they were not hot or very warm at all. The soup was brought out while we were eating our appetizers, shortly afterward the entrees were brought out while we were still eating our appetizers. The lamb masala had good flavor for left overs. The same for my wife's vegetable vindaloo. Naan is an extra charge, soup  is included. All in all, clueless service as far as normal meal service goes (but polite). Reheated food passed off as made to order. For  a $31 lunch I would rather check out a buffet for $10 less for two people."}
{"text":"Samosas Chat, shrimp vindaloo, garlic naan, spinach chicken, chicken tikka masala and Dahba special were all excellent. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Middleton in September for the Midwest Tandem Rally and happened in for dinner after a day of riding. We were absolutely delighted with the food and service. We were told they had just opened that week and sure enough, I couldn't find any place to give them the glowing review they deserved. Fast forward to November and we went back for a weekend \"get away\" from the Twin Cities and had dinner again here at Dhaba.  Still one of the best meals we've had out and a real bargain too. I actually signed up for Yelp just to give this restaurant a review."}
{"text":"The Chicken Vindaloo is awesome. Actually, awesome isn't awesome enough to describe it...  Imagine the best thing ever and multiple it by infinity. 

Only downside is now all other food pales in comparison. For the rest of your life every bite you take will be compared to and fall so short of the Chicken Vindaloo."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant like three weeks ago through the grubhub delivery service, for my boyfriend I ordered the chicken shahi korma and it was decent, he did not like it too much and for me I ordered the paneer Masala which supposedly comes with cottage cheese, onions, tomatoes, raisins and cashews ( they call it a royal delight) and all I got was \"a royal fiasco\"! It was a container with a red liquid (which I imagined it was a can or two of tomato paste with 5-6 cubes of cottage cheese, I couldn't believe it! Not even one raisin or cashew or anything similar to a veggie or nut, I spent $13 for that! As you can imagine, I will never ordered from that place again. The Maharaja restaurant it is expensive also but they really do have nice flavorful dishes with veggies on them!"}
{"text":"\"Best Indian food in Madison\"
One of our favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. Food is awesome and so is the service. We enjoy eating non-vegetarian thaali and the price is unbeatable. They also serve vegetarian thaali. These both thaalis  are only served on weekends and that too only lunch."}
{"text":"Oh damn, the food here is amazing. I don't have the best palate at distinguishing the Indian flavor profile but I absolutely love the food here. I'm looking at their menu online now but can't seem to find anything that I'm sure that I've eaten before so I can't name anything specifically. I've eaten here three times now and look forward to more."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison by far! We order weekly and the food always superb. The owner is very friendly and accommodating. My father in law who is Indian loves this restaurant as well!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting earlier this week.  The service was excellent, very prompt and attentive.  I had the samosa with chutney for an appetizer--it wasn't what I'm used to for samosa, as the chutney was served as a sauce over the samosa, but it was delicious! I ordered the lamb vindaloo 5/5 heat, and it was excellent, though the heat was more of a 4/5. I was given some extra hot sauce, though, without even needing to ask. 

The dining area has high ceilings and is nicely lit and welcoming. The entire restaurant was exceptionally clean.

I give Dhaba a high 4-star (I've not yet given any restaurant a 5-star). I'll definitely be back soon, one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"So the only thing that would make Dhaba better would be a Waunakee location. :( 
But seriously, when you are talking to random people about where you are eating Indian food for Christmas, and  they say, gee I know this great place in Greenway station... You know it is good. 
We have high standards for Indian restaurants. We formally lived in the San Francisco area. Indian food is ubiquitous there and usually mouth wateringly good. I'll admit, I've tried a couple of the other \"great\" Indian places in town - well, let's just say, I was disappointed. 
As a disclaimer - my in-laws (mid-westerners through and through) call this the \"hot\" Indian place. Yes, Dhaba's palettes are less Americanized - something I LOVE about it. I did take a friend who doesn't like anything spicy (hot) and she told them \"no heat\" - and she was perfectly happy with her dish - so if you can't handle heat - I'd suggest ordering with no spice. Otherwise, if you are low-heat tolerant - downgrade by at least one degree your favorite spice preference.  
Feel is industrial - but at least they have not gotten into the metal seating trend, but I'd wear a sweater if you are cold easily and not ordering a lot of spice. 
In the choice for soup or salad to go with your meal - choose the soup - always. 
The couches for waiting are very comfortable, the wait staff and owner are great respectful and yet attentive. I'm so glad that they are there! Yummy and authentic, delicious flavors that no matter how hard I try at home, I just cannot replicate."}
{"text":"All you need to know about this place is that it's wonderful. The tikka masala is the best I've ever had and their garlic naan is second to naan (haha...get it? I had to) Anyway, dinner is a tiny bit pricey, but if you just order an extra rice and 2 orders of naan with one entree, it's PLENTY of food and a great price!"}
{"text":"I just died and went to Indian food heaven. Seriously though, if I were on death row (that would suck but...)this would come a very close second to my family's homemade Cincinnati chili. In the US it's very difficult to find the quality of Indian food you will find in the UK.  Yes, the UK where I believe Chicken Tikka Masala is going to be declared the national dish over fish and chips! You cannot turn a corner without smelling the Indian food bliss slap you in the face. AND finally! I have found an Indian restaurant that has met their match in the US of 'Merica! Dhaba Indian Bistro is ah-mazing! So what was for dinner you ask? Lobster Madras with Garlic Naan. No, Lobster Madras (a little spicier and more flavorful in my mouth) was not on the menu.....but they made it. No questions asked. I knew the Vindaloo was too spicy and the Masala too weak for my buds so...they just smiled and brought out a beautiful dish full of those Indian flavors I have missed so much. Too bad they're not in my hometown; I'd be there once a week...minimum."}
{"text":"Let's just start with Yum!! The staff were friendly and courteous from all the moment we walked in. My husband ordered the tikka masala and I ordered the fish masala with a side of cucumber & mint dressing to cool the heat (delicious!). We ordered a mid-range heat level, 3 out of 5, and it was great! A little spicy, but oh so good. My husband loved the HUGE basket of naan and I was SO happy with our dinner. Craft beers were a bargain at $3.95 and the wine selection was so/so. Kendall Jackson reserve Chardonnay at $8/glass was a ok. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy enjoyed Dhaba! I highly recommend eating here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I am being overly critical of Dhaba or perhaps their quality has slipped. My mother and I were craving Indian but didn't want to do the Swagat buffet so we decided to check out Dhaba. Of course every Indian restaurant has their 5 star dishes but I can sadly say that what we ordered wasn't 5 star quality. Was it edible for me yes, however, my mother stated multiple times that her beef masala was inedible. In fact, she stated that she had never tasted meat like that which was in the masala and even compared it to organ meat. After being extremely turned off by this I was reluctant to try it. However, I can tell you that my paneer masala was a solid 3 stars. The panner cubes were exactly as one might expect but the sauce to paneer ratio left much to be desired. That being said, the rice was perfect and the sauce was tasty. Was it the best masala that I have ever had? No, but it was far from the worst either.

In addition to having the entrees, the lunches were also served with a small soup or salad. We both opted for the lentil soup and a side order of cheese naan. Both were solid but nothing special. The lentil soup was bland but edible and the naan was a solid waste of calories.

For the $9 or $10 price tag per entree, Dhaba is definitely at the top of the Madison Indian food spectrum for lunch especially since even plain naan is extra. I happen to love Indian food quite a bit and often have to resist licking the bowl clean. However, Dhaba left much to be desired and I can say that I won't be going back with the better options around the Madison area."}
{"text":"Ordered the Non-vegeterian Meal for Two to go. While the food seemed great quality it was a little bland. I had ordered over the phone and the gentleman who took my order was rather impatient and unhelpful. I had asked a few questions about the spiciness level of the food since there was no info on the menu (i.e. a 1-5 scale) and he was thoroughly unhelpful and the food was very mild when I picked it up although I prefer spicy. So maybe my lack luster experience is due to this misunderstanding. I will give this place another shot but next time I think I will order in the restaurant even if it's togo."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The service is impeccable, the staff is friendly and the food.... Oh, the food is a crazy good. If it is your first time, I recommend ordering the Paneer Curry dish from the vegetarian menu. You will not be disappointed.

They now offer a 10% discount for cash. Which just upped the appeal of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The BEST Indian in town. We live on the east side but make the trip regularly. Nice staff and good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Honestly, not very experienced when it comes to Indian food, but this was really good in taste and serving size. More of a 3.5 star experience, but no option for that, so no wrong in showing a little extra love. 
We had the lamb curry, goat curry, two types of naan bread, along with a chutney and a yogurt sauce. All were perfectly spiced for the level we ordered (mild & medium), and the bread was excellent. 
Ordered online through a delivery service, so I imagine it's even better going straight from kitchen to table. Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time I've had Indian food, so I was skeptical... But this place was so good, I took my boyfriend. He also loved it!  My favorite items on the menu are the garlic naan and chicken Curry #5"}
{"text":"This was a second choice after our first choice had over an hour wait -- it was a Saturday night. We were pleasantly surprised by the elegant atmosphere when we walked in. We were immediately seated at a cozy table near the back of the dining room.

Service started off quickly, with salads, but then slowed down considerably from what it had been, and our waiters changed mid-service. Despite some inconsistencies in service, the staff was always polite and willing to answer questions.

My wife ordered Chicken Mango Curry, with a light spice level. She initially felt it was still too spicy for her, but after bringing the leftovers home and trying it again she thought it wasn't as spicy as her first impressions. She liked it, but also thought it was a touch too sweet.

I ordered the Chicken Tika Masala, mostly because I had made it at home following a recipe I found online and wanted to see how close it was -- it was pretty close, but Dhaba's was better. Mine was a medium spice and it was just right for me. An excellent dish that I would order again.

Desserts were exotic with a floral taste. I had the fried milk balls and my wife had some sort of creamy sauce with a sweet cheese.

We both look forward to returning and trying different dishes on their inviting menu."}
{"text":"Came here on our way back to Chicago from Kalahari resort. The ambience is nice and the food is good. Watch out for the spice levels. If you can't eat spicy food then stay with mild."}
{"text":"Hands DOWN the best Indian cuisine in the Greater Madison area. Not just great food though -- a totally relaxing atmosphere and overly gracious waitstaff. We've only been here a handful of times and somehow every time we arrive we are greeted in a way that says \"Hey, we know who you are and we are glad you came back.\" Singing their praises!"}
{"text":"So glad we found a good Indian restaurant in our area! Woo hoo! We order the fish masala (medium spicy) and the chole with garlic naan and it is soooo delicious. The prices are reasonable and the food is so flavorful! Also they are very quick when we call to order takeout so we have been very pleased."}
{"text":"Sixt stars. The best authentic food in the area. Lunch special is a mix of their best. Combining lamb and chicken in three typical Indian varieties."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. The staff is friendly. Fish pakora, mushroom masala, chicken sagwala - awesome!"}
{"text":"An absolute gem with some of the best Indian food that I've had outside of south-central Asia. Definitely try the lamb naan and the paneer, and the curries are phenomenal. Very friendly waitstaff and a really nice vibe as well - one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best and most authentic north Indian (Mughalai, Tandoori) food I have EVER eaten! This is a great place, run by folks who seem to have been in the restaurant business for some time. More then anything else, the owners are involved in the kitchen, and that shows in the quality of preparations and serving.

Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good north Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I've had take out from Dhaba three times and each time the food is absolutely amazing!  In the past I've had their Aloo Naan, Spinach Naan, Lamb Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Shahi Korma...all perfectly tasty.  Today I ordered Chicken Madras, Garlic Naan,and the Mix Vegeterian Platter to go. After picking up the order and opening the bag at my office, I realized the rice was missing.  I called the restaurant and they offered to deliver the rice immediately, even though I offered to pick it up. The gentleman that delivered the rice also included a delicious dessert, which I think was Kheer.  Talk about amazing service!  The food is very flavorful and of high quality.  The staff is always friendly and I've always received amazing service.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lunch special (meat platter), and I'll definitely come back for it again. For the price ($9.95) it is great value - three meats, four slices of naan, awesome yogurt sauce and dessert. After all that food it is pretty much impossible to still be hungry.

My friend ordered the chicken biryani ($8.95) which we both agreed was quite good.

The only thing that was average was the mango lassi - nothing to write home about.

Very friendly staff. Clean and spacious. Ample parking. Right next to Greenway Station to walk off the calories. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my absolute favorite cuisines for its flavor, spice, and creativitiy, but the price of it versus my grad student budget makes it a special treat only. After seeing Dhaba's affordable lunch menu online, I had to try this place out. I'm incredibly happy I did.

Surprisingly quiet for noon on a Saturday, but it just meant that my food came to me faster. The $6.95 lamb curry with basmati rice was savory and delicious. Medium spicy was definitely medium, so as a spice enthusiast, I'm getting hot next time. For the price, I certainly didn't expect a choice of soup or salad with my entree, but ta-da! I chose the lentil soup. While it was a very small portion, it was really good, with carrots, vegetables, and lentils in a light broth. 

The strawberry lassi arrived with whipped cream and a cherry on top, like a strawberry shake, but one sip revealed a great blend of strawberry with a yogurt tang. It went really well with my meal.

Last but not least, the naan. Garlic naan. It's my weakness, and this is some of the best I've had. $2.95 got me a basket full of hot naan crammed full of chopped garlic, cilantro, and ghee, and it was wonderful.

So for $13, I got a meat curry, soup, lassi, and naan. There are Indian restaurants that would charge me that for the entree alone, and the quality of the food was the same, if not better. Dhaba is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food was great. Unfortunately due to a chef error they put mushrooms,which I'm allergic too, when we requested none. They apologized and gave the meal for free, but I'd recommend being careful still. Their chai was good, but I still miss the taste of jaggery."}
{"text":"First time going yesterday for lunch. AMAZING, the flavor the service, the price and again the flavor! We had Chicken Kabob's as appetizer, chicken done perfectly and the chutneys that came with it were delicious. We had Chicken Curry and Paneer Masala. The flavors were amazing. And our final bill was so reasonable! We definitely will be going again and again!."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Madison. I've tried many dishes here, chicken and vegetarian, as well as many of the appetizers, breads, and chutneys. Everything is excellent. Some favorites include the chicken shahi korma, muttar paneer, vegetable samosa, and garlic naan. I enjoy the professionalism of staff and owners. A really nice dining experience whether at lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We have a voting system at our workplace that lets people vote on what they want for lunch that day. We try to keep it fair by not allowing a restaurant to win twice in one week. However, if we forget to start a vote, often times we're forced to \"Default Dhaba.\" I'm pretty sure those moments of forgetfulness are freudian slips, because we friggin love this place.

Personally, I've found my vice: chicken tikka masala with cheese naan. This amazing combination of bread, cheese, and curry has everything I've ever wanted in a good meal, and then some. I've found some other indian places that have similarly good masala, but the naan stands apart. No other Indian restaurant I've visited has come close to the wonderous naan found at Dhaba."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison! Haven't had a bad dish on the menu. Very friendly staff! Had many birthday and graduation parties there. Give it a shot. Tikka is very good, Rogan Josh is great too"}
{"text":"A lovely oasis of elegant, yet personal, table service in a mecca of fast food lunch joints and chain restaurants by Greenway Plaza.

Extensive menu selection, delicate spicing, refined presentation--all served by waitstaff who clearly know their menu and are enthusiastic about it. Attentive service , yet unobtrusive--no \" hi, I'm Patel, your new best friend \" business--just genuine care and grace about your experience.

All dishes are served promptly (no worries, office park crowd)--in lovely crockery and china, with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware--no sporks here--creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation--even during a busy lunch hour. 
Quiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills--another plus.

(No typical Indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get the flu bug either.)

Dhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home. 

Best basmati rice in town--all very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have a religious devotion to their lamb masala and cheese naan...has overtaken Swagat as my go-to Indian Food on the west side. The owners are also nice as hell."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Indian buffet since the quality tends to suffer at buffets. This one is a welcome change. we usually do carry outs on weekend. Paneer masala is very good. Their breads are extremely tasty and fresh. Each bread had two big pieces so two people can share. There's a good variety of breads available spinach, aloo, garlic etc. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this restaurant! The service is quick and the wait staff is very friendly and professional. Try the garlic nann - it has cilantro. I usually get the chicken tikka masala. You can order the food from mild to spicy on a scale of 1-5."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant. The portion sizes are very generous and the service is always outstanding. Very friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"This was only my second time and my boyfriends first time experiencing Indian cuisine.  The staff was helpful with recommendations and patient with our questions.  The décor was simple, classy and upscale. We shared two dishes; chicken curry and shrimp tandoori.  Both were great.  No leftovers!  We each had a dessert and were happy with not only the dessert, but also the price and portion.  We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Dhaba Indian Bistro is so good. I've only ordered take-out so far, but the dining room looks nice.  I love all their choices of naan, the Samosas and their many vegetarian choices.  I'm able to spend about $13 and stretch it to two or three meals!  They let you choose how spicy you want curry dishes, which is nice.  Flavors are vibrant and so good... I might have to order from them for supper tonight just thinking about it!  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch at dhaba bistro - Their Thali, is  economical, yummy and the perfect quantity. Better than most Indian places that offer a buffet. A buffet offers a lot of variety but variety, in my view, comes second to the quality of the food. Dhaba's thali promises great quality along with adequate variety. Weekend Indian food - think Dhaba thali."}
{"text":"Everything was great from appetizers to the cup of chai. The amazing service made the whole experience even better. Glad we stopped over!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here this past Wednesday and the Chicken Tiki Masala was tender and juicy. The naan was still warm and soft. The rice topped off our meal. I eat Indian in several cities I travel too and this was one of the better places. A nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, food was ok. We ordered most dishes in the \"Nice\" category but was definitely too spicy for our friend. Did find a problem that was shared  with the staff that should have been escalated to management by staff. This did not happen and we did not pursue it. 
 Servers and their service was good."}
{"text":"This was one of the best indina restaurants I have ever been too. My girlfriend recommended the place after her coworker visited the restaurant for lunch. The food was was very flavorful and the service was very welcoming. I couldn't stop stuffing my face with the delicious food."}
{"text":"Best Indian food for hundreds of miles. We stop any and every time we can. We recently took family from overseas and they couldn't stop raving about it either. Portion sizes that are outrageous along with top notch service, you can't go wrong.  Everyone is happy. Try the tandoori chicken or garlic naan."}
{"text":"We went to Dhaba on a whim and we were blown away by the Malai Kofta! It's a vegetable and paneer dumpling curry with creamy tomato sauce and topped with nuts. The lunch special was only $8.50 and included rice and a side soup/salad. The ambiance was authentic and refreshing, with bright tall windows and plenty of spacing between tables. We also ordered the potato samosas as an app and both thought they were a little dry. The trio of sauces complemented the samosas well. 

All in all, I highly recommend this west side bistro! The staff are responsive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty Indian eats and a cozy ambiance with great service. Not much more I can say other than seek out this hidden gem if you are ever in Middleton."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ever had Indian food. I GREATLY enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala. I went back quite a few times because I worked across the street. I've since had other Indian places and I can say this is the best I've had yet. The cheese naan was on point. The service was superb. Very friendly always. They even let us know that they have \"off the charts\" spicy. The hottest they have would rate maybe a 2 on the Thai spice level. So if you request off the charts they give you some extra spice to add on your own."}
{"text":"Best place for desi food in the Madison area I've tried so far. Delicious, flavorful food and generous portions. The ambiance is chic and modern and the staff is really friendly.

We ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, chicken kabob and spinach paneer. The samosa wasn't excessively spicy and the pakoras were delicious. The spinach had a nice garlicky flavor and the chicken was super tender. Sadly the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. More folks should check this place out so it will stick around! :-)"}
{"text":"Worst food. Ate last night here..ordered appetizer sampler chicken biryani and goat curry. Goat was not cooked properly and the appetizers looked as if they were taken out from freezer and heated in microwave. Biryani was like rice mixed in current paste. Not at all worth it. Do not waste your money or hurt your tummies. This is not authentic indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, attentive staff. I really enjoyed all the vegetarian options, the vegetables masala was flavorful without being too greasy. The vegetarian appetizer platter was perfect for 2 people, lots of food and variety and everything was super tasty. I felt very lucky to eat on the patio there, today as well. The garlic naan was great. I didn't feel like we overpaid."}
{"text":"We visited here on Friday November 4 on a trip to Middleton. We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, which is so super close to this restaurant. Mistakenly, we drove to the restaurant when it would have been very easy and pleasant to walk. There is plenty of parking for the restaurant which is also really convenient for people who drive.

The restaurant was really busy when we got there around seven but we were seated immediately. The menu is really expansive and wonderful for vegetarians. We ordered garlic naan, gobi manchurian, vegetable vindaloo, and had a salad and lentil vegetable soup. The soup was delicious- a creamy lentil broth with a delicate flavor. The garlic naan was very delicious and had lots of fresh garlic and cilantro on top. We asked for both entrees to be prepared mild but we found them to be more medium spicy. That made it hard to finish my dish. The gobi Manchurian was really delicious and was freshly prepared. The vindaloo had a lovely vinegar flavor which we loved, but it was a bit too spicy. 

Once we were finished, we waited 30 minutes before going up to get someone to bring our check. That was ok since we weren't in a hurry. It was such a treat to have great Indian food on our trip to Middleton and I would definitely recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for about 2 years, sometimes we drive to Madison just to come here for lunch! We have been known to come 2 times in one week because the food has always been great! I myself always get their beef masala! The beef is always so tender that you can shred it with a fork. The masala sauce it's self has just the right amount of spice and the color is a creamy red. My husband always gets their chicken byriyani and loves it! He said that the chicken is always so tender and you get big chuncks. The sizes of both meals are great for what you pay for. We also get the garlic naan, and it has so much garlic flavor. 

The staff are always friendly and helpful. The owner has talked to us about recipes and just about anything else! They have a running special that if you pay cash for your meal you get 10% off for lunch and 20.% off for dinner."}
{"text":"Had Dhaba for lunch today.  Fast service, pretty place, and food was amazing!  Had the Chicken Vegetable, Beef vegetable, garlic naan, and lamb samosa. Great sit down filling meal for two people and a beer only $33 all together. 
I Have had Swagat before, wasn't bad there either, however just wasn't super impressed, food was average, coming here was much better, enjoyed the food! Will be coming back for sure!!:)."}
{"text":"A great delicious Indian place in town! I was surprised when I arrived on a Sunday, there was no characteristic aroma nor the classic lunch buffet! Very excited I wouldn't bring the aroma around me after food and sadly feel hungry all the time.... 

We were the first customers at around 11am, the space was wide and you could easily fit large parties of 10 or more. As we went through our lunch, several other tables arrived. We noticed that a couple with a young baby was seated right by the bathroom, placing them further away from other tables; my friends and I thought that was extremely thoughtful of them!

I really enjoyed the food selection, some things are completely new and I have not seen them at other indian restaurants.

Good dishes to try:
Mango lassi - much more yoghurty than other places, actually really refreshing with food!
Meat platter - nice chicken tender-like things, fried fish was nice and flaky. And i love the cracker and sauces to dip on the side
Aloo naan - potato naan sounds weird, but seriously, you'd not go back to regular naan!!
Beef briyani - great flavor, and surprisingly spicy. beef was tender and tasty!
Chicken Makhani - loved the thick tikka masala sauce. very well cooked chicken! love it!

We shared the dishes among 3, and had at least a third of the dishes to bring home as leftovers. Just a note, the dishes were still wonderful after microwaving ;) Finally, be aware of the spiciness level, for Asian tastebuds that eat moderate spicy level, 2 stars is more than enough!"}
{"text":"Really pathetic service. It took 1 hr 10 minutes to take order and serve food. The orders are not taken in orders and Indians are given less preference than foreigners."}
{"text":"While I was in Madison I found this gem, definitely 5 plus stars for this place if I could. The food is just spectacular and their spice level are very rightly scaled (lot of time I order spicy food but I don't feel the heat but Dhaba was on point) I dined there twice during my stay and the food was freshly cooked, I truly enjoyed the dishes and all of their staff was super friendly and courteous. 
Definitely will be visiting again next time I visit Madison, and I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful afternoon sitting outdoors at Dhaba. The lunch specials sounded so good that I had a chicken lunch special and my wife had the vegetarian. Both were made to medium spiciness and were served promptly. Cold Indian Kingfisher beer went well with both. AAA+ service. We sat outside and enjoyed the day."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal, this time with Tariq by my side. He really enjoyed his food but will never stop measuring the food against the incredible delights at Anmol in Milwaukee. That said, Dhaba did just fine. 
We were both over-hungry after spending a couple hours at Shoe Box. We had the Allo Tikki Chat to start. Chana Masala and a yummy potato mash together with some sauce. For entrees we had Lamb Bhartha and Paneer Masala. There was loads of tender lamb in a wonderful sauce. The paneer are squares of homemade cheese in a creamy masala sauce. Both were perfectly seasoned to the medium spicy we requested. We also had the naan that was soft and tasty.
Tariq had chai which was excellent, not too sweet and I had a Mud Puppy, dark beer. The beer was a good compliment to the spicy food. 
The service was excellent. I would have liked a little time to finish my appetizer before the entree arrived. Final bill $47 with a full meal of leftovers to go. 10% discount for cash.
We shall return. Get the to the Dhaba. No excuse not to."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. It's always a good sign when an Indian restaurant does not have an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet!

The food is fresh and authentic. One of my Indian friends who dines with us frequently here always requests small changes to a dish, and they always accommodate her. 

The owner and chef is Punjabi, so definitely try the butter chicken. Other favorites of mine are the paneer masala, bhindi (seasoned orca), and any of the biryanis. If you like lassi, both the mango and classic lassi are great. 

This is a casual restaurant with a quieter than normal atmosphere. Service is efficient and friendly. We never seem to need a reservation - we typically just walk in and are seated immediately."}
{"text":"Dhaba Indian Bistro is a great choice for an Indian meal, and the quality is consistent whether you are eating in or taking out. The staff is always friendly and happy to make recommendations. The interior is clean and inviting, although there is a strange round table to the right of the welcome desk, and I would avoid that on a windy or rainy day. The portions are ample and delicious. Having tried many of their curries, I'm confident in recommending almost anything here.

Let me recommend the Chicken Makhani. It's naturally quite spicy, and as someone who normally likes spice at a 4 on a 5 star level, I always have the makhani at a 2 Dhaba. The garlic naan are always a hit too.

The only dish I have tried that I didn't care for was a lamb curry. I found the lamb to be fatty and I really didn't enjoy it. I haven't tried it since, so I couldn't tell you if it was a one off. I can confidently say that the chicken is consistently high quality.

Top tip?! 10% discount from the price of your dinner either eat-in or take-out when you pay cash!"}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be my go-to Indian restaurant in Madison. Very unassuming in the mall that it's located in, but they've done a nice job of making the ambiance such that you don't feel like you walked into a strip mall restaurant. The staff is friendly and very good at what they do. Every dish we ordered tasted soooo good. Take note - there's a discount if you pay with cash - so bring cash!"}
{"text":"Waffled between a 2, 3, and 4 star review, but eventually went with 2. While there were a few \"Wow!\" bites of food (The Manchurian Gobhi and the Cheese-stuffed Naan dipped in my Chicken Curry were fantastic,) there were many \"Meh.\" aspects of the meal (The garlic naan, Mixed Vegetarian Platter, mixed greens salad, the low amount of chicken in my chicken curry). Beyond that, the food was a bit expensive and the service wasn't enthusiastic. I feel like 4 stars should be reserved for places where everything is either pretty good or great and the wait staff makes you happier.

Pretty nice building and food presentation, but the food itself, as a whole, didn't impress me much; nor did the cost or the people working there."}
{"text":"I was on this side of town for work, heard good things about Dhaba Bistro and thought I should check it out.  I decided to get take out for lunch. The staff there were very friendly. I went with the Vegetarian Masala. It was very tasty. It had peas, potato, sweet potato, carrots, and onions.  The sauce was a creamy tomato based sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  I would say the 2nd best Masala that I've had in the Madison area.  I also got an order of their Naan.  I found it to be overly greasy. Their prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area.
Will get food again here when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch. The food was very good. Traditional Indian fare, done well. Food was hot. Service was attentive and unobtrusive. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always great service and food. Always get the \"one cup chili\", ever since recommended by one of their waitstaff. Good beer selection. Careful with the 5 star hot choice - it is the real deal. I like hotter food but only get 3/5 stars here."}
{"text":"I have missed Indian food! This place a refreshing reminder of how good Indian food is. I would recommend it and probably will go back when I am in town again.

I had the garlic naan, lentil soup, and lamb curry. All had great flavors, the only knock I would have is there was only about 6 pieces of lamb in my curry and it was mostly sauce (it has been a while since I have had Indian so maybe that is to be expected?); but the sauce made for great dipping my naan in."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Indian food. In fact, it was the best indian food ive ever had. I highly recommend the chicken makhani and the strawberry lassi."}
{"text":"Taking the cues from other reviewers I gave Dhaba a try for lunch. A single dish of lamb  biryani was enough to say I'm coming back with friends so I can try more dishes. 

Simple decor and practical. Floor is just sealed cement. No carpets to stain. Settings are nice. White linen table cloth, not paper or plastic. Red napkins folded like a crown. All set up and ready for dinner crowd when I came. 

Lunch prices are very decent $10 with tax gives you a nice lunch. 5% - 10% off if paying by cash.  For a group, that's significant. 

Food was good. I had mild spiciness and that's perfect for someone like me. The lamb in the biryani was very tender. The dish was tasty with the right amount of spices. I wished it was a little warmer temperature wise. Even then I would still consider coming back for more. 

Service is ok. The server who cleared my table just dump the utensils onto the plate, making lots of clanking noise. Felt rough and did not match the quiet ambience."}
{"text":"I had some friends in town who love Indian food and we were on the west side of Madison so we decided to give Dhaba a try. Wow! We were blown away. By far the best Indian food we have had in the area. Even the simplest dishes like the rice were far and away the best we have had. Light, flavorful, I think it had cumin seeds in it. 

We had the naan and the aloo naan. Hot, buttery, dense and chewy, yummy! Our group of four had the lamb vindaloo curry, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobhi, and chicken tandoori. Everything was so good! They will ask you for your spice level and although ours ranged from mild to hot, the flavors of every dish were outstanding and everyone was satisfied w/the spice level. We even had leftovers to take home which were just as good the next day!

The ambiance was clean, bright, and upscale. The service was polite, warm, and polished. There was really nothing about the experience I would have changed. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Embarrassed to say I am new to Indian Cuisine :)  That being said the waitstaff here was incredible in helping me decide by making accurate comparisons. The flavors keep your mind guessing and your palette interested. They get an A+ from me on portions, affordability, knowledgeable waitstaff and flavor. I'm HOOKED!!!"}
{"text":"I started coming here at the reccomendation of some friends and was nervious as I had only had Indian cuisine at Swagat before. This absolutely blows it out of the water. Even our extended family, who was nervous about trying different food, LOVED it. We come here almost weekly at times and love either dining in or taking out. There is a wide variety of food and spice levels. The service is fantastic and there is almost always a coupon available. This is a staple in our houshold and we do not plan on changing that any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing find.  Only one issue is that it is not open Monday.  Great food, staff is fantastic and friendly."}
{"text":"A good value for money. We had veg and non-veg weekend Thali. It had 3 different curries, Raita, rice, naan and a sweet dish. The curries are more catered to American taste buds. It was mild and somewhat sweet. The naan was the best. Extremely soft and buttery. The raita was too tangy. We asked for pickles which is usually a standard with Indian meals but they charged us $1.95 for it and didn't tell us it will be extra to order that. We also tried a tandoori aloo paratha which was good. A little extra spice would be perfect. 

If u are looking for authentic Indian taste, it might be little further away from it. It looks very authentic but the owners have catered their meals to mild taste buds. This place should be recommended for mild Indian food. They didn't have an option to increase the spice level for Thalis which was a bummer for us. I would have rated this place higher if the food had more spice in it. 

All in all, a very good value for your money. $10.95 can't be beat for all that food."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  Had the Punjabi chicken kabobs for starters followed by Kadahi Chicken."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Butter chicken and chicken tikka masala both were amazing. The staff went above and beyond to serve us. Clean and great atmosphere as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful decor, and really good service. My wife and I ordered the non-vegetarian dinner for two and everything was fantastic, with the exception of the lamb curry, which was a little too tomato-y for me. I especially loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Kheer. Also, phenomenal mango and strawberry lassi. Our new favorite Indian place in the Madison area. Be warned, the dinner for two is more like a dinner for three, it's a lot."}
{"text":"Get ready for some real good Indian food. It would be unrealistic of me to expect 100% authentic Indian taste that you can only find in India, but this place is pretty close to being authentic, which is great because even this level of similarity is hard to find.
What stood out, was their keema naan, malai kofta and butter chicken. Best thing about Indian restaurants are that they have excellent variety of vegetarian dishes. Paneer makhni here was out of the box. Naan/breads were very very fresh, seemed like straight outa oven. We ordered keema naan, garlic naan, spinach naan, butter naan and regular naan and all were good.
Good service too, we ordered their veggie vindaloo and found it to be very tangy letting them know about it, their manager replaced it with another dish. 
Good ambience, great food, good service, clean bathroom, Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala is a great favorite.  My two kids (ages 4 and 7) eat it like it's ice cream. 
The restaurant was hopping...a great new Indian restaurant on the west side."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I have ever had. We got the Tandoori chicken and sampler appetizer. Everything tastes fresh and spiced just right. Dishes were a good value."}
{"text":"My buddy and I are Indian restaurant connoisseurs. We have tried pretty much every indian restaurant Madison has to offer. We always compare the new places we try to Dhaba because this has to be the best one we have found so far.

Food is consistently amazing and service is also top notch. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. Not to mention, they are a really good value. While it's definitely pricey, it's not bad compared to a lot of the other indian restaurants in the city.

My favorite is the paneer tikka masala. It's not officially on the menu but they will make it if you ask. It's very well seasoned and spicy enough for my tastes. They also include a cup of lentil soup which I've never seen at other places."}
{"text":"Although there are several good Indian restaurants in Madison, there are few to none where I actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal.  So I do take out.

Dhaba is the exception with its wide open windows and floor plan, and overall pleasing ambience.  Plus the food was excellent.

The veg samosa was perfectly cooked, and even reheated beautifully in the oven the next evening.  The crust is the tough part with samosas.  These were flaky with no toughness.

The lamb vindaloo was certainly lively, but not too spicy.  (I ordered it medium hot and it came that way--sort of 7 out of 10 on the heat scale.)  The lamb was sufficiently tender which is the first thing I look for in an Indian lamb dish.  I thought the sauce was a bit one-dimensional, but still satisfying.  Could use a side of raita.

The baingan bharta was the best I've had yet.  It had that beautiful mashed consistency with plenty of zing from the garlic, ginger and eggplant.

The chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh, almost too much in that I really love that curried Indian spinach sauce with just about anything.  So the chicken kind of dominated the dish.

I ordered ginger naan which was sprinkled with cilantro and was both tasty and useful for sopping up the delicious sauces.

Caution: Yelp had this place listed with a full bar, now corrected, which was wrong.  WIne and beer only.

We will be back when in that part of town.  The ambience and table settings are comfortable.  I won't have my sights set on a Beefeater martini now that I know.  I look forward to exploring more facets of Dhaba's reliable cuisine."}
{"text":"Let me say up front that I'm stingy with the stars. As far as the food is concerned, it was very good. I think a four or five star rating needs to have \"great\" food. The ambience was nice, and the decor was fresh and modern. It's always nice to see white linen tablecloths in a restaurant. 

I usually order Tikki Masala when I eat Indian food, but wanted something different today. The server thoughtfully suggested several options and I settled on the chicken madras. I liked it. It wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was a good choice. I come away pleased with my choice to eat here. 

Also, they offer a discount to pay in cash."}
{"text":"The Girlfriend and I tried the vegetarian dinner for two.  I don't know what was in it, but it was great.  The waiter was friendly and didn't laugh at us when we were confused on what to get.

-Signed that guy."}
{"text":"Giving three stars because I had high expectations going in that were tempered by a few quibbles. But first, the good: the food was very good. The chicken vindaloo and chicken curry were both delicious. I was a bit surprised by the heat -- you can order any dish from 1 (mild) to 6 (\"some like it hot\"). I'm middle of the road -- I like some heat, but just enough to spice it up, not knock me over. I'll seek out the jalapenos on my nacho platter, and douse my eggs with Frank's Hot Sauce, to give you an idea. Sure, I recognize that it's somewhat subjective, but even so, the \"3\" on my chicken vindaloo was surprisingly hot -  a little too much for my tastes. For what it's worth. My friend, who's a little less heat tolerant than me, ordered her dish as a \"2\", and the same went for her - just a little too much. There's a decent selection of craft beers, and the menu is extensive enough that I saw several items I'd like to try next time. 

The place is clean, with a modern, austere vibe - concrete floors and exposed ceiling. In contrast to the food, the temperature in the dining room was brisk, so I'd definitely bring a jacket or sweater next time (our visit was in November, when you're hoping that the temperature inside is a little higher than in the parking lot!). The wait staff were courteous and helpful. 

Tip: if you're going on a weekend, be sure to ask about thali - it's not on the menu, but it looked delicious."}
{"text":"Went there on my lunch brake to get two orders of naan to go, it took them almost 40 minutes to complete my order. EXTREAMLY slow!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Quick and efficient service. Price was average to high. 
I would go there again. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options as one would expect at an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time an was overwhelmed by the food and great service! 

Got the Vegetarian Dinner for Two! Was about $40 so was concerned about the price/quality/quantity of the food but was quite happy with what came. Huge generous portions of 3 entrees(which we didn't even finish 1/4 of-took it to go!), soup or salad(healthy lentil soup! Wasn't the best lentil I've had but not bad! Will probably try the salad next time), great naan and rice and a top notch dessert to cap it all off.

Service was great. They had 2-3 helping us throughout the entire meal. No waiting around for a check or a change to your order or, well, ordering your food to begin with. This is very important to me - even more so than the food in many cases so I'm quite happy! 

Will return! I can say this is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison now. I'm tempted to try the buffet sometime also"}
{"text":"I asked for a table next to the windows this time, and the ambience was just fine. The waiters are also very attentive while unobtrusive, all in all providing a nice quiet experience.

I had the fish pakora again alongside tandoori paratha. The fish pakora was still quite good, although milder than I remembered. The paratha was disappointing. I admit that I'm not sure what paratha should be, but it seemed tasteless to me.

A nice place overall."}
{"text":"Chai: Excellent
Non Veg Platter: Excellent
Aloo Naan: Acceptable
Aloo Prantha:Good
Gobi Prantha: Excellent
Personal attention: Excellent
Paneer Masala: Could have been master.
Chef owned and Chef managed, It indeed is expensive, original taste through and through."}
{"text":"I dined at Dhaba last night with a group of 8 coworkers at around 7pm. Located in the Middleton shopping/eating area, parking was very convenient.

I had the Goat Madras (a South Indian style dish) and was very happy with it. So happy that they served the goat dishes with bone. The goat meat was so tender and falling off the bone with the creamy marrow and perfectly gooey tendon. The combination of spices, tamarind and coconut milk was very flavorful. I had spicy level 3 (on a scale of 1-6) but it was very mild- could have gone up to a 4 or 5 to feel some heat. I also ordered the Mango Lassi but was not too impressed. It was very bright yellow and a bit too sweet. 

My Indian colleague had the Butter Chicken (which was halal) and said it was really good. My other colleagues had the Lamb Masala and Lamb Madras and they were happy with it too. The Lamb Masala had more of a spicy kick to it compared to the Madras. 

All entrees came with either soup or salad. The lentil soup was delicious. I think it was lentils blended until it was very smooth.

I also appreciated how they asked if we wanted separate checks from the very beginning, making payment seamless. 

Great place, even for a large group!"}
{"text":"This Indian food is great, consistent, and delicious. Jump in and start eating!

When Dhaba opened in Middleton, it became our weekly take-out option. I've never actually been to the restaurant as my co-worker always makes the pickup. 

Over the last six months we have rated each dish to our preferences. Here is our list of the best tasting meals that we've had. Sadly, we have not yet eaten our way through the whole menu. As long as Dhaba makes food, we'll continue eating our way through the menu. We've gone heavy on the lamb and vegetarian dishes and skipped most of the chicken and beef. That said, here is our list of favorite dishes. All dishes with an asterisk are my personal favs*.

{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Madison.

Tasty north Indian food. 

Service is decent. 

I have been many times here and their food quality and taste is consistent. So you wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been here plenty of times for lunch and dinner. We prefer the lunch vegetarian thali. It's a great value for money. You get a mung dal soup to start and then a plate with rice, naan, 2 vegetables, lentils, raita (yogurt) and a dessert. Naans are hot fresh and soft, the spice levels are perfect on the vegetables. The raita is soooo flavorful I normally don't care for it but Dhaba makes some good raita. 
I felt dinner was not much value for money. Portions were a little smaller than most other Madison area Indian restaurants and food takes a while to come out on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"While staying in Madison, I felt the urge to eat something vegetarian. Indian food was of course my choice and this place was interesting. I went and was seated pretty easily, I ordered the Channa Naaan, which came with a side of rice. It was honestly a little pricey, considering the fact that I could probably make that dish at home for a few dollars. However, it tasted good and the waiter was pretty nice. He even asked what spice level I wanted and when I asked if it was a scale for Indians or white people, he said Indians. 

I saw a few other Indians eating in the restaurants, which I believe is a good sign. Usually when you go to an indian restaurant and there are no Indians eating there, it is indicative that the food is bad or is primary to western standards. I would suggest this to anyone looking for Indian vegetarian and possibly vegan food in the area!"}
{"text":"Really good food with really, really, really, really poor service. In short, one appetizer and two entrees for two people took a total of two hours -- and 45 minutes of those two hours were spent waiting for the check.

Our server was almost nonexistent all evening. We never received refills even though our drinks were empty, and he never checked on us after the food arrived. When we were finished eating, we sat for about 20 minutes at our table while our server waited on other tables. My husband finally walked to the front and told our server we were ready for the check. For the next 15-20 minutes, we watched our server walk around and take other orders, refill waters and bus tables -- but no check delivery. We finally both went to the front, ready to go, and told him we needed the check. He printed the check, set it on the counter, then walked away to continue tending to the other tables. No \"thank you,\" no smile, no waiting for us to sign the check and hand it back to him.

We really loved the food at Dhaba; our appetizer and both entrees were delicious. With such poor service, though, I can't give Dhaba a positive review. If I return at all -- which I doubt I will -- the visit will only be for carryout."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day. 

I miss Dhaba already, if you live in the greater Wisconsin area you gota excuse to go to the middle of no where and give this place a shot.

EnjoY the pics and the Videos !"}
{"text":"As a 4 year Madison resident, I've been to every Indian restaurant in the area. Dhaba was surprisingly excellent. The atmosphere was very clean, quiet, and professional. We had the veg biryani, naan, and vegetable mango curry. The food was awesome; not too spicy, flavorful, and they were in decent portion. I would have easily had to spend twice as much for the same dish at a place like Swagat or Maharani. Don't forget this is is Bistro as you may not get the most cordial waiting staff!"}
{"text":"Small little place that was very clean and modern. Ordered the lamb vindaloo extra spicy and it wasn't very spicy. Service was a little slow and they only gave us one serving of rice for two dishes. Had to ask for another, but it took a while to get the attention of our server. Food was good, but not spicy like requested and like it says on the menu."}
{"text":"I dont know when they opened, but we were driving through and it said now open. Having been to Swagat many times ( still love swagat)  this was a welcome change and just a new place to try some desi food. Really really good! Very happy for having stopped by with a friend for lunch. Very affordable and hot yummy food, and the quantity was more than enough we were quite stuffed and content.  The food in itself is yummy we ordered the vegi thali and it came with four big naans, a side of rice and three veggies plus kheer and raita. We also had an option of  either soup or salad to start off with. This is one place I will be stopping by often. Ambience is nice and staff is very friendly :) , was a pleasure to dine here and I will definitely be back for more and be sure to recommend this  place to  friends."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Dhaba for lunch and always as take out. We place a large order, ahead of time, via phone and the service is always great! The order is always ready on time and 100% accurate. I give Dhaba a 5 star rating for superior service and quality food. Staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent one of the best restaurants nearby Madison. We would definitely visit it again. The chicken mushroom and the Naan were amazing."}
{"text":"Good Indian food in the vicinity. We tried their weekend thali which we found the portions to be scanty. Also found an eyelash in my rice pudding but I am ready to put it behind me given I ate there twice and wasn't disappointed. I like their dal makhni which may not be matching my high standards of Delhi style dal makhni but still pretty flavorful. Try their lamb over chicken for it is really well done."}
{"text":"Food was okay the whole experience a bit lackluster and waiters hovering around me checking to see if I was done constantly. I didn't appreciate that, just disturbed my whole dining experience."}
{"text":"The best indian food I have ever had!
Vegetarian appetizer platter- all items had their true uniqueness. All retained crispness after being in a takeout container.
Lamb and spinach was flavorful and tender. Nice dpice balance.
Garlic naan was crisp and chewey even after bring in takeout foil!"}
{"text":"Get the mango chicken. It is sweet and savory and spicy.  I also really liked the chili cheese naan. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The stellar reviews for this place have to be fake. DO NOT go to this place! Mediocre food, and worst of all, mean/petty owner.

I treated my in laws here to their first Indian food (I am Indian), and to their last dinner in Madison. We ordered a lot of food and were supposed to get 5 salads, but only got 4. Then we were just $5 short of the cash discount and the front girl was so mean/unhelpful; she sent us to walk to an atm so far away that we paid in cash after a failed 10 minute walk/run. We were embarrassed in front of my in laws and I was sad that the service was so bad for a place I've been to many times. No special treatment for a regular here!

Dining out at the end of the day is about people, and these folks don't make you feel welcome. It's all about the last penny, and worst of all, by mean/uncaring staff. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay the same amount but to a nice and apologetic staff member.

Also: Food is not good. Lots of creamy curry and very, very little meat.  Could not even order a plain lassi, suggesting everything is premade. Naan was okay but too oily. Soup was way too salty and lukewarm. And place is always almost empty (tonight was Saturday at 7-9pm, only one other family) with no music etc.

I was a regular and even considered making them my businesses' regular caterer but won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We had chicken kadhai and it was amazing. We ordered parathas as well and they were like home made. If you are visiting Wisconsin, trying this for indian food is worth."}
{"text":"Probably the most expensive Briyani and not worth of the cost. We got chicken and lamb briyani. And all tasted like common (Maggi) masala. Definitely not worth for the price."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was beyond my expectations. When a third party ordering application glitched during the process of my order the owner took the time to hand deliver the appropriate items to my hotel. The food was hot and delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! A hidden gem on the west side, maybe the best Indian food in the Madison area. Friendly service, delicious authentic food, and a cash discount. Was at a meeting at Epic and wanted a break from the typical deep fried, high carb Wisconsin norm. This should be a must-eat stop for anyone passing through or is in the area. Flavorful, authentic, and healthy with the right level of spice! A quick walk from the west side hotels."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice - modern and immaculately clean, with pleasant decorations.  Service was friendly and efficient, although not very personable.  Food was amazing.  The Vegetable Masala was perfectly spiced, and had a rich creamy curry sauce. The Baingan Bartha (eggplant) was also great, and had a grilled \"open flame\" flavor. Nan was excellent, a bit thicker than most indian restaurants,  not at all greasy and stayed soft even when it got cold. The mixed vegetarian platter appetizer was very good, although the samosa and aloo tikki could have used a touch of spice. Also enjoyed the Vegetable Mango, although would have liked it better if the mango sauce was thicker. At many indian restaurants mango sauce is sweet, at Dhaba the mango sauce had a rich, savory taste.  Nice. Be cautious though about spice level. Medium at most indian restaurants, would be a 2 at Dhaba."}
{"text":"We love Dhaba! I think we've taken every one of our out of town visitors here at least once and everyone has loved the food here. The service is great too and the waiters always remember our family and go out of their way to accommodate any requests. Even my somewhat picky 3 year old loves the food here. His favorite are the \"naan pizzas\" dipped in the lentil soup. Hah. The chicken bhartha is probably my favorite although the daal chicken is pretty amazing too. If the food isn't spicy enough (which has never really been a problem for me, but rather for my husband) you can ask for their spicy sauce to jazz things up! It's seriously spicy though so I usually steer clear. I love the sitting area outside too, although it would be great if they added comfy cushions to the metal chairs!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and was surprised that it wasn't busy. I've been to Dhaba a few times and would argue it is probably the best Indian food in Madison for non-buffet style. Samosa chaat is a great appetizer that can easily be shared. I always get chicken tikka masala and a paneer dish and love the flavor. Not too rich and just the right amount of spice according to your preference. Their garlic naan is to die for! Service is usually great, but this past time our server seemed to be a bit forgetful."}
{"text":"Love this place - the food is amazing, staff is friendly, service is quick, there's never a wait for a table, and did I mention the food is amazing?  I've tried several of the chicken curries and they've all been flavorful and the spice level was right where I requested it (medium).  My husband ordered the chicken chili the first time we came, and he can't bring himself to try anything else because he loves the chicken chili so much!  The food comes out piping hot, too.  Also, I left my purse there last night and two waiters came running out to our car to catch us before we left, which was so kind and evidence of their top notch service."}
{"text":"Tasty food and courteous helpful staff. 

I had malai Kofta, chicken malai, punjabi Kabab, sweet lassi and naan. My favorite was chicken items. 

Price is slightly higher side. Sunday lunch only there is concessions and you get thali for 10 bucks. If I live in Madison I would go for Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent!
Must make multiple selections to really appreciate how awesome the food is."}
{"text":"This walking distance from hotel Hilton Garden which was nice. I wanted to try out authentic Indian food.  This place was good, atmosphere quiet, nice and ok to eat by yourself. Service was also good. Now the food - too many choices but I ended up getting chicken Marsala with bread with mixed ginger and yogurt. Very good just wanted it to be more spicy."}
{"text":"I really like this place because the food is really that good and it's very close to my house. The restaurant seems very clean, the decor and music are pleasant. They use white linen on the tables which I think gives a good touch. I always get the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. My mom gets the lamb curry with soup. Super delicious!  I like it better than swagat in middleton. The employees are very nice. One time I had to wait extra long for take out and they gave me complimentary glass of wine."}
{"text":"This placed got \"best ethnic food\" award from Madison.com so yes it it quality Indian food. 

My favorites are: butter chicken and lamb masala. Food quality is very good for its relatively cheap price and large portion. 

The service though is a bit slow. They have 2-3 waiters/ waitresses only so on a busy day, your dinner might have to wait an extra 1-2hrs. I went on a Saturday night one time, and it was so busy to the point I felt like I could just leave without paying and no one would notice. We waited for 30 mins for the food to come out. After we finished, we had to take the to-go box ourselves, packed the left over and still had to wait approx 20 mins for the check. The waiters were rushing back and forth between tables so if you are expecting a relax ambience, you are at the wrong place."}
{"text":"I've dined at the restaurant twice, and had take out once. It has been wonderful every time! The food is very good, and the price even better. Though I haven't tried everything on the menu, I have really enjoyed everything I've ordered so far. The only sad thing is that the place isn't as busy as it should be for the service, quality and quantity for price of the food your receive."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm Indian and a bratty SNOB when it comes to Indian food. My family is Punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant, so I very much appreciated the mostly North Indian menu. 

Food: YUM! We have the Non-Veg appetizer platter (SO GOOD! Keema Samosa was one of the best I've had). We ordered malai kofta, chicken tikka masala with garlic and chicken naan. We later got some Saag (spinach dish) and kheer. 

Naan - We ended up trying garlic, chicken and plain naan. All kind were great! 

Malai Kofta - Best I've had in Madison. I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. 

Chicken Tikka Masala - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!

Saag - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. 

Kheer -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. 

We ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. 

Restaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).

Overall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! 

P.S. If you like Taste of India on Monroe street or Brookfield/Fox Valley, the owners family runs those locations as well. 

TWO THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. My husband and I come here about once a month since our first visit several years ago. We love the fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside naan along with the chicken makhani. The main reason I love this place is because the curry can be customized to your level of spice tolerance. My husband loves spice and I have a low tolerance for it. Love this place and the staff they are always kind."}
{"text":"Reviews are true, the food and service here is great! 

Some of the best Naan I've had and they have such a variety of flavors! We ordered the Garlic Naan - fresh, not too thick, crispy edges, and great flavor!! We also got the Lamb Curry and the Goat Masala, both creamy, perfect amount of salt, and meat was so tender!! Goat is a little tougher, but that's expected. For drinks we ordered the Mango Smoothie which I would pass on ordering, nothing special and came out a little warm. For dessert, we ordered the Pistachio Kulfi which was also just OK and small for sharing.

5 Stars for the main dishes and naan!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night with a craving for some Indian deliciousness and were not disappointed. The lentil soup that comes with the meal was delicious, and both of our meals were awesome. I had the chicken Tika masala and my husband had the butter chicken. We both had spice level 3 which was perfect for him but a little too hot for me. I had garlic naan (yum!) and my husband had a wheat version which was probably healthier but also tasted kinda like cardboard. Both of our dishes reheated well the next day, and the price was great! Very reasonable for the amount of food provided.

Interior was clean and classy, very nice feel for a dinner date. Only complaint was service was pretty slow. Not a deal breaker, but not as fast as other locations in Middleton."}
{"text":"Love the samosas and pappadam. Had the butter chicken medium spice. Wife had chicken tikka masala. Outstanding! Even my picky kids ate something. Mostly the naan, but they have about 7 kinds."}
{"text":"Tried dinner here after an Epic XGM day and was extremely blown away with the great flavors of all the food, low key ambience, and amiable service.  I opted for level 3 heat for my Chicken Shahi Korma based upon another Yelp review.  If I have the pleasure of being back in the area, I will return to Dhaba and go with a level 4 (or 5!) heat next time!  We ordered 3 different kinds of naan--- garlic, cheese and peshawari naan--- and they were all so tasty that I had no room for the basmati rice that came with the korma.  The peshawari was a slightly sweeter naan with hints of cashews, raisins and coconut--- nom nom nom! We closed the food flavor experience with gulab jamun for dessert--- 3 tiny fried balls soaked in a sweet sugar syrup with a subtle hint of rose!  I only regret not taking pictures of it all to post with this review."}
{"text":"Great northern Indian food. Outstanding take out and dine in many options. Authentic and homestyle Indian food like mom would make! Highly recommend the chicken tikka and paneer tikka as well as any of their tandoori dishes and appetizers are good also. Wide variety of meat chicken vegetarian options for all courses."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

If you're being lazy like I was the other day and merely put in a generic search for Indian restaurants across Madison, Dhaba comes up right up there amongst the most reviewed and apparently liked joints. Soooo off course we had to see what the fuss is about.

This place doesn't do Buffets (Why O Why!!!) but it's known for its tasty ala carte and their Special Veg/NonVeg Thalis (An assortment of food, served on a platter typically including appetizer and dessert)

We decided to lunch in here and ordered their Meat Thali ($10.95) and the Meat Platter ($8.95), along with a Lemonade.

The Meat Platter had Fish and Chicken Pakora (Spiced Nuggets) and Lamb Samosa (Kinda like an empanada). These were served with an assortment of Chutneys (Tamarind, Coriander and Onion). All 3 items were seasoned and fried well and tasted fine. The samosa was a tad bland though.

The Mains arrived in their Thali decor - Butter Chicken, Lamb/Goat Curry, Chicken Tandoori Kebab, Rice, Naan, Raita (Yogurt mix) and Kheer (Dessert). Here's my individual review :
Butter Chicken - Very creamy and tasty. Good job here!
Lam/Goat Curry - Hard to chew meat. Curry was OK
Chicken Tandoori Kebab - Cooked beautifully but lacked seasoning.
Naan - Too thick on the edges so ended up wasting a lot
Rice - Well cooked with smoked jeera (Cumin)
Raita - Tad too salty
Kheer - Not creamy. Average

So, was it a bad food experience? Nopes. But it was nothing outside of the strangely apt rating of Yelp (MEH). If you're close by this place, then a decent option, especially the Meat Platter. If you're not and have other options to contemplate over, you do just that!"}
{"text":"Yaba Dahba Dooooo! Wow! I had the vegetarian special on Sunday which gives you three vegetarian curries, rice, an order of naan, yogurt sauce, rice pudding, and soup/salad to start for $8.95!!! In Madison, that's a bargain; at any price with food this good, it's awesome. The staff was great and it was nice and cool; clean space."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, and it took an hour and a half on a Tuesday night.  Delivery driver blamed it on having to wait on the restaurant - but I'm not completely certain where the disconnect was since my hotel is within walking distance.  Chicken Korma was the blandest I have ever eaten - but the Chicken Tikki Masala was very redeeming.  I ordered both at medium heat, so it was really surprising to have one be so flavorful and the other so bland.  Naan was very cold by the time my order arrived.  May try dining in next time - difficult to discern quality when I'm not sure how long the food sat prior to delivery.  I would NOT recommend ordering delivery to anyone else."}
{"text":"We tried Dhaba some time ago, and at the time, we weren't trilled; however, every place (almost) needs a second chance, and last night we gave Dhaba a second chance--and I'm glad we did as it was much, much better than the first time we went.

Typically, we begin most Indian dinners with vegetable samosas. Dhaba's were really fresh, and for the most part, really good. I thought they could use a tich more spice, but my husband is more sensitive thought them perfect. We were both impressed by the lightness and freshness--as if they had been made fresh rather than made earlier in the night and heated up. 

One has a choice of either lentil soup or a salad with each meal and we both opted for the lentil soup. While there was nothing about it that stood out, it was warm and comforting--a vegetarian sort of chicken soup. My husband thought it a bit gritty, but that's just the lentils.

For entries we always share. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Malai Kofta. These entries have the same sauce/gravy, but we don't mind that, as we end up taking the extras home and cooking them together for leftovers. Both dishes were creamy and were very good. Again, because of my husband, we ordered them mild. He thought there was a tiny kick of heat, but I found them tasty, but not at all hot in terms of spice. We also had plain naan, which also was fresh and light, with a little butter or ghee on top. 

The service was a tich slow, but it was Saturday night and we got there they were super busy; however, we only had to wait maybe 10 minutes, so that wasn't bad at all. The servers were kind and apolgized for the slowness. It really wasn't a huge problem. 

We have an embarrasment of riches in terms of the quantity of Indian restaurants in Madison, and Dhaba rates as one of the really good ones. I am awfully glad we tried them again."}
{"text":"This Place is so close to my office that it was inevitable to try. so glad i did, the best, most flavorful dishes are served here. the cheese naan, although not too traditional-Indian, is the best I've ever had. their chicken Masala is also incredible. The price is right for on the go lunches with generous portions. a bit overpriced for dinner with same menu/portions as lunch, and that's why they get 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but amazing food and fabulous service here. My favorites include the Tandori Mixed Grill, Chicken Madras, and Chicken Tika Masala. Be sure to try the peshwari naan-a sweet kick to the traditional naan. You will quickly become a regular. :)"}
{"text":"After several years of ordering takeout, I had the pleasure of dining in at Dhaba on an early Saturday afternoon. The space is beautiful; tons of natural light, warm colors, festively folded napkins, and an ambience that is a step closer to fine dining than casual. 

Service: top notch. Truly. Every need we had (which were few due to their anticipatory and attentive service) were attended to, the staff was so warm and welcoming, and they had touches that I'm not used to like waiting politely to set the menus down until I had removed my coat and taken a seat. 

Food: double top notch. I think it's the best Indian food I've had to date. Now, I have to admit that I order chicken tikka masala every time, but that's what I order from every restaurant. I was only half joking when I told my boyfriend I would probably drink the sauce as a straight shot. The chicken is incidental (white meat, tender, good quality); I honestly would be more than happy just dumping the sauce on rice and on naan and calling it a day. Speaking of the naan, it's warm and so soft and, as it turns out, even more delicious when served in house instead of as takeout. 

Dining in we were also offered soup or salad, and we both went with the soup. I believe it was a vegetable lentil; it reminded me of dal. The soup was served at just the right temperature. My boyfriend tried the chicken makhani; rich and chicken-y and a good kick of spice at medium. 

Each of our meals was $8.95, a steal for how much food you get and the wonderful service. I think I'll skip takeout from now on and treat myself to dining in."}
{"text":"Rather disappointing for how much promise and flair. We opted to get the thali and were disappointed with the quality of the food as well as the freshness. 

Started with the salads where the lettuce was not fresh or not washed properly. 

Moved on to the main course where all three dishes had something wrong with them. The spinach paneer was bland which is shocking because it takes a special skill set to screw it up. The masala veg was a good dish however again bland. The eggplant dish was sub par and lacking any flavor kicks. The goat dish was undercooked thoroughly. 

All in all, it has a good ambience but if you're looking for a good indian food place please avoid this. We surely will."}
{"text":"The quality of the service here deserves 5 stars, especially considering the price of the meals.  The linen tablecloths and napkins are almost absurd considering the prices, too.  Really nice plates and utensils.  The decor...well, this is more in line with what you pay.  Think Chipotle: concrete floor, exposed ducts under corrugated roof...industrial casual.  Kind of weird.

The food: samosas were good.  Meal comes with a little cup of soup, which was tasty.  Garlic naan is fine, nothing special.  Curry was not apparently traditionally made; the sauce was mediocre, tasting only of tomato and (too much) chili pepper, with no simmered meat richness.  Rice smelled distinctly of used ashtray (seriously).

Great service, good prices, kind of jarring atmosphere, and just OK food."}
{"text":"Very good food. Dal tadka in specific is exquisite. I come here everyday for dinner and enjoy a good taste of north indian food.

Food is not only the best part, the staff here is very friendly and polite. Service is also very good. Although sometimes your order may take a little extra time to come but it is worth waiting."}
{"text":"All potential for disappointment gets checked at the door and never makes it inside. The friendly owners, portion-to-price ratio and succulent entrees make this place 5-star awesome, a must for anyone who enjoys Indian food. This time while I waited, the owner told me all about Uttarayan, one of India's many major festivals. 

I brought home the chicken tikka masala (wife's favorite) and the chicken vindaloo, along with the veggie appetizer sampler. The samosas are a personal fav and I get those every time, if for no other reason than the sampler of sauces they serve with them. Nirvana for me would mean being dipped in those sauces. Please don't eat me though. The pakoras (fried veggies in a hummus batter) are also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better than I do.  

For entrees, I ordered the masala mild, but would step that up a notch next time. The vindaloo was medium-plus spicy and perfect -- just spicy enough to make my forehead sweat but not so spicy as to dominate the flavor. The chicken in both entrees was tender white meat, expertly cooked. 

Eat here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and Paneer Masala. The waiter asked us on a scale from 1-5 how spicy we wanted it. We both said 4. The Paneer Masala had a little bit of heat but the Lamb Vindaloo was not spicy at all. I thought Vindaloo was inherently spicy?

Service: was poor. It was 8pm on a Friday night. There were a few parties waiting to be seated, but the host did not bother keeping track of who was there first. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes before someone came to our table to get us water and take our orders. The food took about 45 minutes to an hour to arrive. The waiter did not come by at all after taking our order or dropping off our food. Finally, it was just as difficult finding someone to bring us our check. We get it. You're super popular and busy on a Friday. Work on your customer service. Either hire more staff so each table can get the attention it deserves or train your staff better.

Dhaba is out of the way for me and I probably will not return. There are other restaurants with better service that are closer to me."}
{"text":"Never buy chicken Briyani & chicken curry. I ordered carry out for a dinner. They put big chunks of frozen chicken which was very hard in both. It was same pieces in both Briyani &the curry. We threw it away completely. Come on, I am paying 30 bucks for this, these guys should realize & make something good."}
{"text":"Great Lunch!
I had lentil soup, shrimp & veggie biryani, garlic and a New Glarus Spotted Cow beer.  The dining room was very nice and very clean.  The wait staff was very friendly and well trained.  The food was delicious!!!  I will go back and highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"I can genuinely say this is one of the authentic indian restaurants. They have managed to preserve the rich indian flavors without \"Americanizing\" the taste.

5 star for the price, quick service and amazing food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Dhaba Indian Bistro a few months back and I have been a fan ever since. I have yet to have a bad experience with either the food or service. The staff is very friendly and definitely remember regular customers 

I really enjoy the basmati rice. One thing that I do like about Dhaba over my favorite lunch spot Curry in the Box is that they do not use jasmine rice. While I do like jasmine rice, the basmati rice is a better fit for the curry. Long grain rice blends very well with the thickness of the curry. 

They offer a large variety of curries ranges from types of curry's and spice levels. The work on a 1-5 scale of spiciness, with 5 being the hottest. Let me just say that I have gotten a yellow shrimp curry dish on a 2 scale and it was spicy so be warned. A scale of 1 is your safest bet. My boyfriend who loves spicy food can barely withstand a 3.

They offer quite a bit of curries, shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, goat, etc. I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of their cheese roti bread. I definitely prefer Curry in the Box roti bread over Dhaba, however, Dhaba's bread is more thicker making it easy to dip the bread into the curry and eat. 


Their prices do go up during dinner. Even though I've only gone during their lunch hours, I was told by a regular that their serving sizes aren't any different from lunch to dinner so keep that in mind. 

It's a nice outing for people who really enjoy Indian food and/or curry. I know for some people, the smell of curry really turns them away from eating at places like such but the restaurant does a great job with \"hiding\" the smells. Curry can be very overwhelming but the aroma when you dine ad Dhaba is very inviting."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Food in a wonderful atmosphere!!!

Although we just picked up take out last night, Dhaba Bistro is a very nice restaurant.  Upon entrance, the restaurant is located on the end of building with nice patio/Dhaba seating and the inside is very modern.....not your standard desi restaurant look.

The food was excellent. The samosas were fresh, the mixed veg pakora had a great selection and everything in it tasted good, not oily.  The kids got the mattar paneer which was also very well made and had the right amount of flavor.  The gave just the right amount of quantity and the rice is flavored with just a hint of fennel seeds, giving a sensational and rich flavor.

Overal an excellent restaurant, and probably one of my top picks for indian food in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd be eating Indian food when I went to Wisconsin for business, let alone quite good Indian food. They make things spicy if you ask for them, and everything was very flavorful. The naan was also very fluffy and great. Recommended if you are staying at one of the hotels in the area and want a good meal, especially compared to all the other places in the area"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison. We've tried a bunch places but Dhaba is awesome. 

They have a pretty good beer, wine and drink selection and service is excellent but the place isn't stuffy."}
{"text":"You MUST try this place. Being from NYC I am spoiled by the food and authenticity of Indian food so I am a sceptic when it comes to Indian food when I travel. 

I can't say enough good things about the flavor and food overall. I typically get chicken curry, chicken Tika or chicken marsala but tonight I tried something new....chicken kadahi. Yummmmm! 
I like spicy. I asked for a spice level of 4 out of 5 (just in case they were actually spicy) but I say it was more of a 2 for me. So, if you like spicy....go for it.

BTW, if you pay cash you get 5% off at lunch and 10% at dinner. Nice!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try it because of the good reviews it's been receiving and we were VERY impressed! I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food, but this is the best I've ever had. I used to go to Swagat (which is also good), and there were a few Indian places I frequented when I lived in Denver, but this blew them away,

The Garlic Naan bread is a MUST, we're still craving it today. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala on a recommendation and it was awesome and my wife ordered the Beef Mushroom which was also excellent. We ordered take-out and the food was ready very quickly and it's also very reasonably priced. Plus, they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash.

We have a 1 year old and are always looking for good take-out options, Dhaba might have just jumped to the top of the list!"}
{"text":"Food was good....nice interior and friendsly staff...though the complimentary dal they served was not fresh."}
{"text":"I rarely go to any other Indian restaurant in the Madison area anymore as I know Dhaba is always so delicious and fresh tasting. The main thing I love about this place is that they do not have a buffet...ever. Personally I am not a fan of buffets and would rather order something and get what I want. 

My fiance and I have been here quite a bit and tried multiple different entrees and appetizers. All the food we have tried has been solid. My favorite overall has to be the Chicken Madras. Its similar to Chicken Tikki Masala but has coconut milk and mint it in. So tasty and filling! 

The other nice thing is you can pick your spice level. Whether you are a  flaming hot fan or just like it mild they can make a dish that suites your pallet."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick service, and attentive wait staff. I will definitely be back.  I'm salivating just writing this! Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well complemented by a wonderful atmosphere and service! The chi, nan, and biryani were to die for."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and wanted something tasty, within walking distance of my hotel. Yelp led me hear and I couldn't be happier. Good selection of local beer and some wines. Menu is huge. Large menus often make me worry but after tasting what I got, I'm no longer worried about their menu. I ordered the Chicken Tiki Marsala with the Veg Lentil soup & the Cheese Chili Naan then coupled all that with a couple of a local micro brew's, Spotted Cow...can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Veggie pakora and malai kofta were very good! Kadai paneer was a bit bitter and not as good. Ambience was great!"}
{"text":"First, great atmosphere and service. A great place for a business lunch or date night.  Samosas were large and well executed with potato and peas in the filling and three sauces. The lunch serving had two samosas. I had the chicken curry for my first time here. The basmati rice was delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was faaaaar too salty.  I picked the chicken out and left most of the sauce.   I ordered a level two spiciness and shouldve gone with a three without blinking. Two was to mild for me. $12 for lunch and I had leftovers. I'll give them another shot,  but will skip the basic curry."}
{"text":"Very good food and reasonably priced for lunch.  The only fault I find with the place is the water tastes horrible.   The service was awesome.   I will recommend to others."}
{"text":"What a great little find!! I was pleased to stumble upon this place!!  When I walked in I was greeted immediately.  Service was outstanding... the little things they did that may go unnoticed was amazing for me.  Simply saying please and thank you... excuse me when they came to a table to serve food or ask questions... I was in absolute awe.  The food was outstanding!! I got the extra spicy Tandoori Chicken Spinach and yes... I was sweating!! The garlic naan bread went extremely well with it. I would love to bring my wife here if we are in the area.  And on a nice day, I bet the outdoor seating is amazing."}
{"text":"OMG! Deeeeelish! Thank you fellow yelpers for leading me to this Gem. 

If I lived in Madison/Middleton this would be a regular go to spot for me.  It's a clean, calm, comfortable, quiet and nice environment to sit in, the servers were around and available but not over bearing AND the food was amazing.

 I had chicken tikka masala with number 2 spice level perfect and on point. The cheese naan with Wisconsin cheddar cheese was a nice accompaniment to the tikka masala. Sooooo good, I tried to say room for dessert because a couple items looked delicious, but I was just too stuffed. 

If you're in the area this is a must-try!"}
{"text":"The food is really high quality and tastes great. On the weekend, you can get a vegetarian thali for $7.95. That gets you.soup, three different vegetable dishes, several pieces of naan, delicious rice, desert.
Now, this is not your buffet variety food, the thali is freshly cooked, and you can tell. The spices and flavors are sublime. You are offered mild, medium or hot, as desired.
So, instead of feeling like you have to get your money's worth at a $11.95 buffet, try this place out.
If you pay cash, they give you a 5% discount."}
{"text":"Clean  and friendly staff,  superb food. Flavorful, with  just the perfect spicyness (3-4) and great price for the serving size.  I had the garlic naam and chicken bhartha...yummy."}
{"text":"I think I could eat here every day and not get bored.
The staff is informative and helpful. The samosas are brought with a sampler of sauces, each one is fantastic. It is mouth watering good! The garlic naan is very tasty.
My husband's co-worker ate here everyday for 3 months while she was here for business. I can see why, the items on the menu are delicious. 
This place is a MUST for anyone wanting to experience the best Indian food in town!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved here from a big city, I was incredibly surprised at the quality and taste of Dhaba's food. It mixes authentic favors with classic dishes but adds modern technique. It's a very clean and welcoming environment with a really lovely staff. 

I'm a huge fan of fish fries and was impressed with their fish pakora (lightly breaded and spiced fish) -- it's flaky, moist and arguably one of the best \"fish fries\" I've had in Madison. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice pleasant family run Indian place with an excellent butter chicken.  I'm going to assume they are Muslims because they serve a couple of very good beef dishes.  If I'm by myself or with other South Asians they will serve it up nice and spicy but they default to too mild if I arrive with even one gora friend.  Decor and ambiance much nicer than the other Indian places I like with food this good.  Easy parking."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service!  The servers are very attentive and care about the experience you have here.  I had a mango lassi, samosas(shared), the spinach paneer and naan (shared) and my husband had shrimp curry.  Everything tasted authentic.  I asked for my food extremely spicy.  It wasn't very spicy when I got it and when the owner (I believe) came to ask how the food was he specifically asked if it was spicy enough.  If he wouldn't have specifically asked I wouldn't have said anything, but I did say it wasn't very spicy.  He insisted that he take it back and add more heat.  When he brought it back out it was more spicy and tasted more to my liking of spice.  This was my second trip to Dhaba and I will come again!  Thanks for making our experience a good one!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for take-out while staying at the Marriott. Every item was truly outstanding, and prepared to my exact specifications.  The ingredients were of the highest quality, and the taste was magnificent.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hours say open until 3 but when we arrived after sitting in unexpected traffic at 2:30, we were asked to order to go.  When we said we were not local, no different response....disappointing."}
{"text":"Was driving and suddenly saw this restaurant and decided to stop. I'm glad I did.  I ordered to go but the service was still friendly. Nice environment as well.  I ordered the paneer appetizer and the chicken curry with veg.  I worked in India, and eat Indian weekly and even cook it myself. This restaurant, the service, and the food made me feel like I was back in that beautiful country.  Thanks for making this Iowa guy happy!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting and it definitely won't be our last. Very nice dining area, modern and clean. Our waiter was very attentive and took good care of us. We appreciate the hospitality. 

Great selection of drinks and the food menu was extensive. Everything looked good, so it was hard to decide. We started with the lamb samosas. Really delicious. I think next time we'll get the traditional and lamb together. Ordered some cheese naan, which came along with our meals. The shrimp curry and lamb masala were absolutely amazing. The flavor of all the sauces were so complex and tasty. We decided on a \"3\" level for heat. The basmati rice was so light and perfect. 

Everything was perfect. I have no complaints what so ever. Thank you."}
{"text":"This food is amazing! It's really flavorful and the portion sizes are good. We ordered the vegetarian dinner for two, and it was delicious and the sizes were big. I was in Middleton for a one week work trip, and went to Dhaba twice. Both times, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. Even though it is near a big franchise food area, I would take the trip there for some great food."}
{"text":"My favorite food is Indian and I travel a lot! The samosas are the best I've ever had and they come with a onion tomato chutney that is amazing with the flavor of the samosas. The ambiance is lovely with outdoor seating. Service was perfect. Fantastic selection of beers. Food comes with a salad which is unusual but good. The food was incredible! Just wow!!!"}
{"text":"We often drive half way across Madison to get to Dhaba, and it is always worth it.  
The food is excellent, with a lot of variety and flavor, delicious lassis and the nicest soft-spoken waiters.  Every Sunday, rather than the usual Indian restaurant buffet, they serve thalis (a South Indian tradition of many small servings of meat or veggie dishes on a special steel plate, with rice, naan bread and dessert all for $9 or $10) a great deal, and we get a meal if leftovers out of it too.
Our son loves the dal soup and they let him have a big bowl without us asking.  
Great personalized service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"One of the most tastiest and affordable Indian restaurants I've been to in the MidWest. The ambience was fantastic, clean and no-nonsense. The mixed meat thali had generous portions of chicken and goat which surprised me. For 2 entrees with a tip it cost me about $30, which in my opinion a real good deal."}
{"text":"My expectations were not high knowing that it's an Indian restaurant in Wisconsin.  But...the samosa appetizer was TWO samosas.  The $15 entrees were tiny little dishes filled with so much sauce that it could have been mistaken for soup instead of chicken and lamb entrees.  Very little chicken and lamb with a small dish FULL of sauce.  Vindaloo had much too much tomato.  Tasted like it had ketchup in the sauce.

If you're looking for some Indian food in Madison, then look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Incredible food, absolutely? amazing staff! Nothing but good things to say!, I? recommend? to everyone! We come in for the Vegetarian dinner, Still have yet to finish it, there's? so? much insanely incredibly food we get full before dessert. 10/10 Definitely? recommend?!"}
{"text":"Elegant and modern surroundings, nice atmosphere, excellent attentive service. Got seated right away. The food was good without being memorable. I didn't feel it stood out from the other good Indian restaurants in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Came to town for training and the weather turned really crappy and cold. So I was looking for a place where I can find warm and spicy food to get some heat. I am glad I gave this place a try. Probably the best Biryani I had for a long time. Spiciness was perfect and the lamb was melting in mouth. After the spicy dinner I needed some creamy goodness,  and Rasmalai turned out to be the perfect choice. Light and creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness. I am so stuffed,  I better walk back to the hotel. 
As a bonus side,  they serve local and non local beers and have a pretty rich beer menu. 

Summary: if you like Indian food come here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love weekend thali here. Personally I am not a big fan of buffet's. Veg or non veg thali here at Dhaba, have enough varieties and enough quantity on the plate and it is inexpensive."}
{"text":"Good place for authentic Indian food with decent price.
Felt happy to taste the gravy in which the spice level was as per ordered.
We had Chicken curry and Mattar paneer. Both was delicious.
Only concern is delay in getting the food."}
{"text":"Great food for a very good price. Went for lunch and got the tikka masala but wasn't super impressed by it. The food was very fresh however and the naan was great. Lunch came with a salad. Near the heart of Middleton and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"In town for business, this restaurant is so close to the Madison Marriott West hotel. The hotel complimentary shuttle brought me over. Service was great, professional, but friendly. Food was also great, I didn't take any pics because there are already lots posted.  I will definitely be back when I'm in town and tell all my work colleagues who come here on business to also try this place."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! Tried several different dishes over several visits and had consistently good food each time."}
{"text":"Amazing service. My bf drinks a lot of water and our glasses were never empty. Lol. As much as people might mind that, my bf drank 6 glasses of water so it is nice to have a place that finally brought enough water for him. We got the dinner for two deal which was a ton of food and a great deal for $40. Had a salad, appetizer, 2 curries, 1 chicken plate, Naan, and rice, then finally the dessert. 

Super stuffed and satisfied. :)"}
{"text":"Food- Outstanding, except for the Madison usual: Not spicy or flavorful enough. A bit tastier than Maharaja.
Ambience- Very casual. More casual (and less romantic) than Maharaja.
Service- Bad. We had to keep making eye contact to get our server's attention for the basic stuff and I felt like we were a bother more than a paying customer."}
{"text":"It's a nice location , interiors were pretty with good paintings off the wall. Tried the veg thali, meat thali and a few entree of the menu. The chicken tikka and paneer tikka in the thali were delicious and thali were priced at $9 for veg and $10 for meat. Very disappointed with service. The staff is not very friendly. It took a lot of convincing to replace lamb curry for a daal in the meat thali when a few of us didn't eat lamb. The shrimp curry off the menu was a joke. Shrimps warmed up in tomato sauce. The servers mixed up plates with hot and medium spice levels!!! And some of us had to eat super spicy chicken tandoori. It's an average indian restaurant"}
{"text":"Great Indian?  My favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they don't do buffets) it is so affordable, so you can take multiple items home to try!  For under $30, my hubby and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Vindaloo, Lamb Biryani (rice dish), garlic naan, plan naan, and extra raita.  All meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  We have enough for at least another meal and half!  I am so excited they opened.  Haven't ate in yet, dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service."}
{"text":"For all the people stating that this is the best Indian food in Madison, I can only assume that they have not ever been to Maharaja. Or Swagat. Maharaja is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, and we have been going there for years. But to keep an open mind, we have tried Dhaba twice in the past month. 

First of all, the place itself is nicely decorated, and the service is excellent. The waitstaff are polite and attentive, and there are plenty of them. But the food is just not that good (other than the Naan). 

Every entree comes with either soup or salad. We have gotten their lentil soup both times, which is buttery, thin, and tastes very little like lentils. However, it's not bad, just not very interesting or lentil-y.

For main courses, we have had the Chicken Shahikorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala, as well as the Spinach (ie Palak) Paneer (a combo of spinach and farmer's cheese-like cubes) and Spinach Aloo (spinach with potatoes). 

The first time we tried the Chicken Shahikorma, I was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato soup with a few spices added. Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. 

The spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. 

The Naan is great, I admit. But the rest just is not that good. Seriously, if folks want really good Indian, go to Maharaja and get the Chicken Shahikorma or Tikka there."}
{"text":"This weekend we ventured out to an Indian restaurant that has received lots of love from Yelpers. Though a little bit far from where we live, it was worth a trip. Coming at 1145, the restaurant only had some customers inside. I love the ambience and the decoration. Pretty, neat and clean. When we walked to our table, my eyes are set to the announcement on the wall that says: ' if you pay in cash, you'll have a 5%off for lunch and a 10 % off for dinner. Fair enough.
Once we were seated, the waiter came right away and brought the menu. Four of us chose one different dish so we could try four different meals. We had quite a variety of meals: naan garlic, fish vandaloo, chicken curry, shrimp curry, lamb biryani as the main courses. Samosa and lentil soup for appetizers. For the drinks, we had mango lassie and chai. Was a good experience! The price is reasonable too! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dhaba is my second favorite Indian restaurant around Madison. The first being Swad and the third being Maharani. They have some really good food. The Dal Makhni (Literally lentils and butter) is a must try. It consists of lentils that have been soaked overnight and cooked with butter and spices. They will adjust the spice level depending on your order.

Garlic naan is my best bread. Their garlic is generous and really comes out. It will definitely ward off any vampires that might have strayed too close :) 

On weekends, for lunch, they do a veg and non veg thali. The thali is an Indian version of a sampler. You get small amounts of different items. These guys offer 3 items along with rice and a bread (Roti / naan). For less than $10 it is a steal. When I first saw the thali I felt that the quantity wouldn't be enough to sate me, but I was so wrong. I had to have the additional item I ordered sent back and packed in a to-go box. 

Take cash! They give a 5% discount on lunch prices and a 10% discount on dinner prices if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"Gave Dhaba a try when we were in Middleton and so glad we did. My wife and I shared a veggie pakora appetizer that was very refreshing and tasty. My wife ordered the tikka masala with soup. And I ordered the veggie vindaloo. The vindaloo was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My wife absolutely loved her masala. We shared some garlic naan that was brought out freshly made. The soup was also very flavorful and enjoyable. Washed it all down with a mango lasi. They also give you a discount if you pay in cash. The lunch prices are a pretty good value, considering you are getting everything made to order. We prefer going here for lunch than many of the other buffet style restaurants that are scattered throughout Madison. The staff are also very attentive and helpful in explaining anything on the menu. There spicy scale is pretty spot on as well."}
{"text":"On a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our house...both are great but this one is our new favorite!  Easy to miss from the street, it's worth the search to find.  We have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable.  The food is equally fantastic!  My husband is a huge fan of their tandori chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  The \"dinner for two\" is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too.  The naan was also great as well as their lentil soup.  We are looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I will try to be quick and to the points . I have eaten on all Indian restaurant in Madison this is far better than rest of them in term of service, their food is distinctly good. Not too mild nor too spicy. We ordered daal chicken, chicken tandoori, roti additionally they gave us Raita and soup on the house, having hot soup on snowy day priceless .

I will comeback again .."}
{"text":"The ambience is ok, and prices are reasonable. This restaurant caters to the American palate - the food is sweet and non-spicy. Also they do not have lunch buffet. So if you are craving 'authentic' Indian food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my dinner here and left stuffed and had some to take home.  I did a little research and was looking for something different than old 'merican burgers. And I avoid chains as much as possible.
I arrived shortly after they opened for dinner service. Nearly empty.  Nicely decorated, crisp white table cloths, menus and water were quickly delivered.
I've finally eaten at other Indian restaurants with friends enough to go to one by myself and have a darn good understanding of what is on the menu. And fortunately, there is a good description of the dishes on the menu too.
I love chicken tikka masala, but it is such an easy choice, and British, really. So I got an appetizer of paneer pakora. Uh, yum!   And a ton of them. Lightly breaded in (chick pea flour) cheeses layered with a spice.  Came with 3 dipping sauces... tamarind chutney, onion chutney, and mint cilantro.  I ate them all, yes, I did.  For the dinner I chose chicken Shahi Korma.  The first thing I noticed was how tender and flavorful the chicken was. A good amount of chicken. The gravy was rich and delicious. My only complaint is that I think there was maybe one raisin and a couple cashews in the sauces.   I'm not asking for a lot, maybe six of them?    Served with nice basmati rice. You get to pick the level of heat, I asked for medium, I should have asked for a bit more, maybe they thought I couldn't handle it and didn't make it too hot. My nose was a tad runny when I left though, so there was some heat.
After I read the menu later in the evening I came to the conclusion that the dinners are prepared for two.  I made a valiant effort, walked out stuffed and happy.  Hope I get to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I found this place due to it's great Yelp reviews. I had fantastic lamb Tandoori and Naan to go. The Yogurt sauce with carrots and herbs was a great way to cool off the spicy Lamb and rice. The staff was quick, polite and packaged up my meal quickly.

Want to save some money? They offer discounts for paying with cash instead of credit card."}
