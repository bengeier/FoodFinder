{"text":"Fresh Kitchen is probably the healthiest place that isn't Subway within walking distance of my Barlow offices. 

They have an incredible array of fresh soups, salads, pre-packaged lunch plates (pasta, chicken, etc.) and made-to-order sandwiches and lunches. 

It is a little on the expensive side for some items but it is well worth the money spent. I've heard Fresh Kitchen's owner used to be involved with Sunterra, so he comes with great knowledge and experience. 

As someone now living a sugar-free (as much as possible) and clean-eating lifetstyle, I am confident in Fresh Kitchen as an alternative if I don't have time to prepare my meals for a day."}
{"text":"Experienced the catering of Fresh Kitchen at a friend's surprise birthday party. Everything was absolutely amazing in flavor and cooked perfectly! I tried both types of meat and I couldn't decide which was better! Their salads were amazing and I loved everything about the meal and the fact that it was healthy! They were helpful and friendly!

 If you're ever looking for catering done right, consider Fresh Kitchen for your next event!"}

Did love this place for its snacks and unique meals. Sadly they shut down this location and only operate out of their Marda Loop locations now."}
{"text":"Fresh kitchen is located on 37th avenue in the Shaw building on Barlow trail NE.  People at work were coming in with very aromatic lunches and raving about how amazing this place was when one day I finally made myself pay a visit.  This place is truly a hidden gem...who knew there would be a fresh kitchen in the Shaw building??  If you didn't know about this place, you probably wouldn't know about it unless somebody told you...I am telling you now!  I must admit, parking is insanity because there are a lot of people who work at Shaw and they have reserved parking spaces.  It's a gong show trying to find a spot during the lunch hour that isn't reserved.  My advice would be to park on the side of the street and walk a bit.
 
Fresh kitchen prides themselves in preparing made-from-scratch flavourful meals-to-go for busy people. Fresh kitchen is a cute little cafeteria style joint.  They've got pre-made foods for faster service and their chef-prepared meal-to-go selection.  If they happen to run out, you can wait a short time for nice and hot food.  Fresh kitchen chooses locally grown produce and you can definitely tell.  For my first visit I ordered from a selection of their daily specials which was creole corn and clam & herb vegetable barley and sesame salmon with lemon chili butter.  They had just run out but were starting a new batch of salmon so I had to wait a very short time; it was perfect because it was nice and fresh!  I had my order to-go and headed back to the office.  Okay woah.  The sesame salmon was a very generous piece with the skin kept on.  It was seriously so delectable...so buttery and flakey!!  The sesame seeds were a nice touch, they weren't too overpowering.  The salmon was just all around delicious.  On to the soup...W-O-W.  I took a spoonful of my hot soup and it was fantastic, I literally burnt my tongue because I just wanted to dig right in.  The creole has a nice hit of spiciness and there was a ton of corn, clam and vegetable pieces. YUM IN MY TUM!  You definitely get the home cooking food style when you order from here.

Now that you know my little secret, I'd say try this place out!  They are opened 7 days a week.  Monday to Thursday 8AM - 7PM, Fridays 8AM - 6PM with weekend hours of 9AM - 5PM.  I do believe they have another location in Marda Loop so check that out if you get a chance...I don't think the hours are the same though!!

Also, follow their twitter page if you're interested, as they post the specials of the day! https://twitter.com/fresh_kitchen"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a rainy Saturday night to grab a quick dinner to go.  I'd recently had the smoked chicken, brie, and apple sandwich (also has a yummy fig jam on it) as part of a catered office lunch and have to confess that that's what brought me back on this particular night.

Every time I go in, the staff are beyond helpful, offering samples if I'd like to taste something before purchasing.  On this particular evening, the gentleman serving me was especially noteworthy.

When I was hemming and hawwing over the peanut butter chocolate torte (redonkulously good, but probably best to share) he let me taste it, then threw it in for free.  

I ended up with my sandwich (try it grilled), some fig jam, and dessert, but I was tempted by the many, many other items that they had on hand.  (Watermelon and mint soup anyone?)

I'll be back soon to pick up some of the cheese that they're special ordering in for me.  But, if you're looking for real food and friendly service go check it out yourself."}
