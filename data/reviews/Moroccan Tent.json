{"text":"I took my wife for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food and service was. The place was packed with a large group of people however that did not effect the service. We started with a trio of salads that was very flavourful and now has my wife searching for a Moroccan carrot salad recipe. The chicken kabobs were moist and had just the right amount of spice on top of some spinach (special request) and a side of saffron rice, delicious.  The prices are above average for a lunch, we enjoyed the Moroccan experience. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"The owner Nabil is so welcoming and he ensures you get the full Moroccan experience. We had the soup, B'stila, spinach briq, lamb tagine with dates, and the chicken fasse was to die for!!!!! Finished off with dessert and the most amazing tea. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our experience here started off a bit oddly, with the server seeming put off by the fact that we reserved using open table, with a groupon. Though he said he'd \"make an exception\", despite their groupon not saying anything about not booking through open table, and the fact that we included our groupon information when booking. Plus, they weren't incredibly busy. There were perhaps three other tables there dining. 
However, the food was all delicious. We'd read reviews about people leaving hungry, but we both were quite satisfied. We started out with two harira soups, which had delicious flavor, and for our 2  appetizers, we chose the merguez and shrimp briq, which were both delicious. As our mains we split lamb kabobs with couscous and the lamb tajine. My boyfriend was a bit nervous about eating with his hands, but a fork and knive were supplied without even being asked. Dessert was baklava and something else similar to it, and both were tasty. We finished the meal with morroccan mint tea, which was a nice touch.
We did end up getting over charged for our alcohol, we discovered later. Our groupon was supposed to include two glasses of house wine, which I drank while he ordered three beers, Our bar total came to $46 so I definitely think we were charged for everything.
But, that being said, we will be back, and the value provided from the groupon was good. Just be careful that they don't sneak alcohol charges that are advertised as being free."}
{"text":"This unassuming location in Douglasdale is guaranteed to surprise and awaken your senses as soon as you open the front door. The soft cushions and rugs on the walls contribute to the authenticity of The Morroccan Tent. But be sure to make a reservation because there were many people turned away because the space couldn't accommodate them.

Our dining party of began with 4 strawberry martini with a voice of either gin and vodka. I can definitely say that the Gin was a crisper drink although both were delightfully refreshing.

We ordered \"The Feast\" which was a full 5-courses starting with Hariri Soup, then a Morrocan salad, 2 appetizers; B'Stilla, Briq of Merquez. AMAZING ! Two, tagines with chicken prunes and almonds and the other two with a type of lamb sausage. 

For dessert, the restaurant makes its own golden baklava dripping with honey and fresh pistachio ice cream. Every course was delicious and we all enjoyed every last bit!
I would be sure to recommend The Morrocan Tent. Make a reservation, it's small and if you want to save some money, check out Groupon or other deal sites in Calgary.
Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Family owned and very sweet. If you like Moroccan food, not everyone does, you will definitely like this place!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.  My friend and I each ordered the royal feast so we could sample a variety of menu items.  The soup was seasoned nicely. The chicken B'stilla tasted great, it was a pastry stuffed with chicken and slivered almonds was sweet and savoury. The royal couscous was also very nice as were the deserts. Overall I found the food to be tasty and nicely seasoned.  We finished our meal with a pleasant mint tea.  Throughout our time in the restaurant the server was attentive and we enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"Food is over priced even when using a Groupon. When I visited there was no one actually paying full price. Everyone had been lured in by the Groupon which claimed to be a good deal. I would not visit this restaurant again solely based on the food quality, preparation and presentation. 
Our server was very friendly and the staff seemed genuine which is the only reason I'm not giving this a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Very nice place decor and comfortable seating. Food was very tastey, It comes out in waves to it takes a couple of hours to have the full dinner. The wife thought it's a little spicy but it's just mild for normal people. I would come back and recommend it to others"}
{"text":"Okay in points, we went last Friday 18/07/2015
1- We waited for food from 7:30-10:30pm, YES!!! 3 hours 
details; we were big group and we had a reservation, meaning that the owner knew we were coming
2-Rude waiter, didn't understand the concept of kids! asking them to sit down in an annoying way.
3-NO menu were given to us!!!! the owner dictated what we will eat!!! (since we were a group with reservation).
4-The big tragedy, I wish I took photos of the food. Our table had 5 adults, 6 kids around 8 years to 4 including my 3 years old son. big dish with Couscous and probably 15-20 pieces of mix of chicken, beaf kabab and sausages. and the quantities were a big JOK!!!!! we were also another 2 tables that received the same quantities. 
5- Money, lets talk money, each family paid 120 dollars, charging us around 50 CAD per person. I NEVER paid that much in a restaurant in Calgary, and ignoring this fact, we were hungry, angry, frustrated from the service provided simply it was an awful experience. 
For details about what was offered to us with no what so ever of a choice, soup, appetizers, some kind of pastry (each table shared in), the main course I discussed earlier, then after I left tea, shisha and baklava.
This place is not RECOMMENDED to anyone, particularly for families with kids.
It was a complete RIB OFF!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I bought a Travelzoo certificate, called to make a reservation, and was leary about what I was getting into; however, do not fear.  The food is amazing, and the service is out of this world.  My husband & I will definitely be returning.  FYI - for the feast, expect to be there about 1-1/2 hours.  Great for a date night with lots of time to talk."}
{"text":"Well I will start with the fact that I'm never ever coming back to this place! The service was really bad and the server even yelled at our 2 year old daughter for being noisy even though she was just having fun not screaming or anything! The food was below average, cold tasteless soup, salad was just full of onion and garlic and nobody could finish it. Starter course was some pie filled with shrimps but that was the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a long time! Main course was ok, nothing fancy and portions were really small! So based on the fact that we paid $60+ per person I'm very disappointed and wouldn't advice anyone to visit that place!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Moroccan experience! The waiter was extremely rude and was not helpful in the least. We reserved a seat few days prior and still got seated on tight corner seat at the back of the restaurant. We asked for bread he doesn't bring us. We asked for salad he said they ran out. We waited 2 and half hours for the food to come and only to have it cold and chewy. The beef he claims in was tenderloin but my jaw pain says other wise. We never got the bread and no appies and half the table returned the plates because of the meat and still got dinged $270.00!!!!!! Don't waste your money never ever again!"}
{"text":"We love comming in here for good food in a fun atmosphere. The staff are delightful and we have yet to have a bad evening there. Would reccomend for anyone in the area to pop in for a good bite and a unique experiance !!"}
