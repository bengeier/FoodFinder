{"text":"Anchor bar opened today. Great Wings. Also had the Beef on Weck and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings. So I ordered the 8-10 piece wings. 
The flavour of the chicken wasn't bad. 

However, 2 out of 9 pieces of my wings weren't cooked throughly, as in the chicken was still pink and still had blood running through them. I walked up to them and showed them, with no intention of getting my money back, just wanting to let them know that it was raw and to cook it a bit longer in future for the next person who orders the wings. I own my own business so I know things like this can happen. 

To my shock, the employees there told me the chicken was cooked and not raw. Getting a bit wound up that they think I'm lying or something, I picked up the chicken with my fingers and opened up the wing and the drum even more to show them it was still bleeding. They said it was just the blood line, that it's happened before and that no one has gotten sick. (Are they trying to tell me raw chicken is normal and that this happens all the time?) I said to them 'can't you see the chicken is bleeding?? I'm just here to let you know for next time'. Feeling infuriated at this point I asked for my money back. No apology, no nothing from Anchor Bar staff. 

Will NEVER be returning."}
{"text":"Glad to see a branch of the Anchor in town!!  The d√©cor is a definite upgrade from the original, but the wings are a dead ringer for the original Buffalo Wings.  I highly recommend the Medium wings, and if you're lucky enough to get Brianna as a server you will be VERY well taken care of... Very attentive service, and our drinks never ran dry."}
{"text":"Creators of the original chicken (Buffalo) wings! Similar quality to the original location in Buffalo, New York. This is a must-try for wings lovers."}
{"text":"Ordered a chopped chicken salad and the chicken cheese steak combo. Maddelynn was very nice. Food was very very good. Fries were great. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Loved the original Anchor Bar in the States so decided to give the Canadian version a try. Wings were dry, cold, and not as nearly as saucy or tasty. After asking for more sauce because wings were dry, was charged 1.00 for the sauce. Pretty ridiculous. They don't have the same options for sides. Also floor was very greasy and washroom had a bad smell. Won't be bringing friends here"}
{"text":"Great wings and fries. Will come back and tell friends and coworkers who come through. Staff was awesome too"}
{"text":"I decided to revisit The Anchor Bar and give it another chance since last time I was there it was opening week. I thought maybe all that chaos was the reason for the bad food, and I was right. This time my wings were crispy and well sauced, unlike last time. The blue cheese was on point this time as well, and the fries, man the fries are good!! Service again was GREAT! Maria and the rest of the staff were very AWESOME! I'll definitely will be back after realizing the first time was just a minor hiccup."}
{"text":"I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about. I had the wings and they were great.  I don't do hot so I had the Teriyaki Sesame wings. My husband did get the hot wings and he said they were some of the best he ever had. Their spring roll is quite yummy as are the sweet potato tots.  This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Its cool to visit the inventor of the buffalo wing once. Ive had better. The wings needed more sauce.  The teriyaki ones were actually tastier than the original. Also note, this is a food court not a \"bar\". Nothing wrong with that but it is food court seating which we werent expecting.  So if you want a more sot down with family/friends thpe experience, this might not suit. The fries were ok. Service was slow. Also, many people like the meatier wings they serve but makes me wonder where the chicken comes from.....would go once for the experience."}
{"text":"Dry wings that are no where near the Buffalo location in terms of quality. $40 for 3 lbs of dry wings? No thanks. Save your money and go elsewhere folks."}
{"text":"This is the place! Hands down The Best Wings we have ever wrapped our mouths around! We feasted on a mixed combo of hot and med wings that came with the traditional blue cheese dip and celery stalks. The wings were perfectly cooked.. Crispy on the outside ,moist and drop off the bone tender inside. We also had the Beef on a Weck sandwich that was great and the Buffalo Spring Roll. I believe that anything on their Menu will be wonderful. 
Good selection of Beers.. My fav Anchor Steam and Brooklyn Brown Ale the perfect brews to wash it all down with are on tap. 
We will definitely be back whenever in Vegas! Oh and the Staff...they are so much fun and entertaining. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Being natives of Buffalo, we had high hopes for Anchor Bar when we saw it as an option at the food court in the Venetian. We talked to a couple employees while we were there and they said they are committed to staying true to the original restaurant quality. They said they get all of the sauce directly from Buffalo! We went two days in a row and got the wings (both medium and hot) and beef on weck (delicious) We asked for the wings 'extra crispy' both times and I would recommend that to anyone (they were the perfect level of crispiness). We were very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"Might be the best wings I've ever had.. I eat wings all the time and these are better than awesome!  Even my no brother good in law from Illinois thinks they are the best he ever had!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I got the combo bone in wings for $28. It said it come with 16-20 wings and got 18. I got half salt and pepper and the other half honey ginger. The honey ginger wasn't bad but the salt and pepper was very disappointing. It had no flavor what so ever. In fact, it was plain without salt or pepper. I had to go back and they gave me some hot sauce. The fries were overcooked. I'm not sure how this place got four stars but I would highly suggest avoiding it."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a late night meal since I hadn't eaten dinner earlier. None of the other places in the food court sounded too great, or had too long of a line, so Anchor Bar was a bit of a consolation prize for me.

I went with some boneless wings and sweet potato tots. Both of them were pretty mediocre. Definitely not worth the price, but not horrible."}
{"text":"Came here while I was staying at the Venetian! I'm glad this place was conveniently close. 

The reviews are right! These wings are meaty unlike Wingstop and pretty dang good. I would most definitely go again if I was staying at the Venetian. However, I really wouldn't go out of my way to get wings in Vegas here."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews but I will make an exception in this case. 
I've not been to a place where the service has been so bad. The bar was basically empty yet it took a while to get our beers sent to our table. The server also sent me the wrong beer yet did not change it for me. The food took too long to arrive, and while the wings were as expected, the fries and onion rings were way too small for the price paid. The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the server was pleasant about it, but clearly not well trained."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from a service. Boneless wings with hot sauce & an order of salt & vinegar fries. Wings were good and was the blue cheese dressing but not unique or outstanding....just basic like everywhere else. Don't know how the fries were because they didn't give them to me. They just threw a few plain fries in the same box as the wings & those were a soggy mess."}
{"text":"Amazing wings.  They are big and crispy on the outside...juicy on the inside.  Love the sauce and it's just the right amount, not swimming in it like some other places.  Check out their salads too!  $9.00 for a chopped chicken salad is a great deal.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a recommendation of a friend who claimed to have good experiences there. So let me paint the picture of this place for you. Sunday night the place is pretty dead. My buddy and I walk in, wait about 4-5 minutes before I stuck my head around the corner and got someone's attention. 

We got seated in a booth which seemed way to small for two men. 

Eventually a server came over and took our order. I got a poutine and the mac n cheese bites. $11.49 for the mac n cheese bites and $7.99 for the poutine. When the food eventually came I thought they were child portions, certainly didn't match up to the prices. 

The server seemed very cold and she gave off the impression she didn't want to be there and was clearly not working for tips. I did get a refill on my pop after I got her attention across the restaurant after she walked by the glass on the edge of the table several times. 

All in all too expensive for the quantity and quality of food and definitely not worth the experience either. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Oh no! Where did you go? I had my diet \"cheat day\" today and wanted nothing more than delicious wings and beef on weck. But you're not here. SO SAD! Please find a new location soon!"}
{"text":"Located in the Venetian, the offering is bar style in a food court.

Went with the single wings. The lemon pepper was outstanding!!
Washed down the wings and celery with Anchor Steam.

Very satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Every restaurant or bar goes through transitions and changes. I had never been to an Anchor Bar here or the states. I flew into town and have gone 3 nights in a row and will go again to this location. They're doing a great job staying current. The staff culture reflects their work ethic and they do a great job as a team. Management truly keeps their family happy which translates because the food was great, the drinks were generous and the staff was fast. If people have had a bad experience, I'd urge them to try this location again - they're doing things right. Its rare to find a place that shows true attention to customers. This location brings comfort & makes it a little easier to travel away from family. I would rate 10 out of 5 if I could. I even had to re-activate my Yelp account just to post the review. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After checking in at the Palazzo hotel, Anchor Bar was a small walk to the food court at the connecting Venetian hotel. 

Pros

Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings: The meat was juicy and not overly cooked or undercooked. The crispy skin was the best part and lemon pepper seasoning was on point. It was definitely a finger lickin good kinda chicken. The fries that came with my combo was also delicious since it was super crispy and flavorful. 

Cons: 

Prices: Pricing was a bit high compared to their competitors for chicken wings."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying meals I have had in a very long time. Mediums wings were spicy but flavorful. Fries were perfectly done and the peppercorn gravy awesome. The anchor draft was great as well. I have no complaints and would return again."}
{"text":"We called ahead of time to ask if they would be playing the raptors game. Cam in and they weren't. We asked if they could put it on and they did end up putting it on but refused to put the sound on. We finally asked if we could at the very least be sat somewhere in the back to have a tv with the game on and turn the volume up on it but they made it a big deal. Took 35 mins to get out meals. I got the incorrect meal but the server was actually rly nice about it and gave us freebies as an apology. My wings were rly underdone, the coleslaw was weirdly warm, the celery didn't come w dip and the Caesar salad tasted like the lettuce was washed and never dried - rly watery lettuce. The server was sweet but that was the only good thing about the meal."}
{"text":"I love hot wings.  One could say I'm a hot wings addict.  I've got way out of my way to sample the best of the best hot wings (literally) around the world. So when i say these hot wings rank among the best I've had you should pay attention.  A bit on the high price side these wings are worth those extra dollars.  Izzy, our bartender was awesome.  He made our drinks to protection."}
{"text":"As a part of the original Anchor Bar family in Buffalo the wings are amazing & have well deserved reputation as being the best 
They are the originators after all
Their beef on weck is fantastic 
Classic bar food options are also available 
The staff here are friendly & helpful as well"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype, I had to give this place a try.  I went with the chicken spring rolls and an order of medium wings. The spring roll was crispy on the outside and juicy inside..... And to my surprise there was goat cheese inside!!!   Absolutely delicious.

The wings were crispy and juicy. I like them sauced, but not swimming in the stuff. They were done just right. I am down on the Strip often and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The wings are very good but not worth the price. The prices are much higher than the surrounding competition. It's laid out well with nice tvs and friendly staff but at the end of the day - it's way too expensive for me. $15 for 8 wings is unacceptable!!
 I will not return without a promo or coupon.And not just the wings. All items are over priced. I would have gave it 5 stars if prices were 20% less."}
{"text":"OK,  so the Anchor Bar is a bit overrated to begin with, but we all love wings and want to keep the dream alive. 
I ordered 8 suicide wings. Well if they were supposed to be hot, my butt has nothing to worry about tomorrow. Very mild. Maybe relative but my nose didn't even run in the slightest. 
That however isn't the reason for my 1-star review. The beer pouring policy is horrendous. Minimum 1-1/2 heads of foam, all precisely poured. All beers poured the same and i literally watched the manager give the new bartender the thumbs up when she pointed to the amount of foam. 
Everyone is getting screwed out of beer. Paying for a 16once beer and getting just over 14. Watched other patrons stare in disbelief also. 
This is a skim and not acceptable. Demand a full beer!!"}
{"text":"You know what for all the wing places and bars I've been to in Toronto this is by far the best experience. 

We had the Buffalo Baked dip to start which was delicious. For wings we got got the suicide which was SUICIDAL and the Chipotle BBQ which was the perfect mix!  The blue cheese dressing was surprisingly great for someone who doesn't like blue cheese. Fresh cut fries were decent and fresh. Oh yes wings were crispy to perfection and served at the perfect temperature. 

The service for a spot like this was incredible. Adi, our server was sweet kind and very helpful. Even though the bar area got busy she checked in with us at least a couple of times. (or maybe she wanted to check I didn't die of the suicidal wings lol) the manager did her rounds to check in too. The wait time for food wasn't too long either 

Apparently the dessert is from cheesecake factory but no room in this tummy no more! Will be back when craving spicy hot wings."}
{"text":"Same wings recipe as the original Anchor Bar in Buffalo. This place is going to get VERY busy soon."}
{"text":"Here we go!

Been anticipating these wings for a few months... My buddy from Buffalo speaks highly of the original spot and this place backed it up! I expected a larger venue but it works. Tried hot and lemon pepper both were AMAZING, got them crispy and I recommend you do the same.

Fries were good but they needed to be a little crisper! Overall good experience think im going back soon. Service was great, just wasn't WOWED by this place like i thought i would be!"}
{"text":"Anchor bar is popular for being the fine chaps to of had invented the buffalo wing.

They have a large multitude of flavors you can choose from, both on their French fries or wing sauce. I ordered the combo and got lemon pepper flavor for the fries (choose from lemon pepper, salt and vinegar, Cajun, or regular) and chose teriyaki ginger and sesame  honey for my wings.

The wings itself is pretty juicy and not overcooked at all, and the combo comes with a lot of food. Their teriyaki sauce was pretty interesting and had a slight spicy kick to it that I really enjoyed. If you ask too, they'll let you get a pick and you can try their sauce before you order if you are indecisive.

The bar seating sort of makes things easier if you want to be able to get a refill on your drink and keeps you out of the way of tourist traffic walking through the casino, so I suggest sitting there instead of in the food court area.

Our cashier was also pretty cool at checking up on us and attentive, which I wasn't expecting for a food court slash casino bar type restaurant, or whatever you want to call it..?

The entire combo was about $19.76 which was pretty pricy for chicken wings and French fries but you do get a lot of food for what you pay.
Pretty in short, Its good to try, but I still prefer cheaper options myself for the quality food you are getting. But if you are in the area, anchor bar is a must try for the wing connoisseur.
I'm sure i'll come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little location, they are located in the food court area of the Venetian but the way they have their store setup it makes it feel like a little wing bar. They had some sauces out to try and see what you would want, but would only let you sample 2, thus limiting my ability to choose wisely which sauce I wanted. They only have 8 or so, so its not a huge selection, but the ones I tried (3 total, since I tried 2 and ordered a different one) were just okay. 
I settled on their medium buffalo, and since I had babies to take care of I opted for the boneless (against my normal preference) to make minimize messy fingers. It was fine but not as spicy as I thought it would be considering the mild was the one I tried and assumed it would have been a bit more spicy than that, but really that's just preference and didn't affect my review. 
The chicken was just okay, and at least 3 pieces had some unpleasant gristle in them, and though I cant be certain, they just sort of seemed to be frozen chicken bites like the \"Anytizers\" ones or something. The sauce itself other than not being as spicy as I thought was pretty good, but I prefer my wings to be quite saucy rather than just lightly coated and served sort of dry, and there was no leftover pool of sauce left in the basket. They also had a strange after-spice to them that sort of lingered strangely in the back of the throat that I didn't care for. 
My wife settled on the \"Chicken cheesesteak\" which I think they should have just called \"Chicken Philly\" or something since a Cheesesteak implies specifically that there is steak in there, and though I was not confused by this or expecting anything, and it was laid out well on their menu, but I guess that's just a suggestion, as the name is like an oxymoron. 
All that nonsense aside it was quite good but a bit small. It came with grilled onions and they were very tasty and well caramelized. Both entrees also came with a side of seasoned fries which were good. 
The service wasn't anything special, and the girl at the coulter was a bit awkward and shy, so ordering was difficult. I also ordered 2 extra ranch sides  (which cost $1.50!)  in addition to the one they give you with the wings, and when I got my order she asked \"Ranch or Bleu Cheese\" and I was a bit confused since I was the only customer she had helped all day (we walked up right as they were opening) and so I confirmed ranch and she gave me just the one. when I asked for the 2 more she said they are $0.75 each... hmmm you really forgot about that from ringing me up then only standing there with a blank look for 5 minutes since? 
Anyway so I said I had already paid for 2, so after asking to see my receipt she gave me one more now making my total 2 (in case you aren't following I should be getting 3 total) then I said, yeah I need one more, and again confused she said it would be $0.75, so I pointed out on my receipt I had paid for 2 and she said I had 2, so I asked \"doesn't the meal come with 1? then she got it!
Overall ity wasn't bad, it just wasn't great, and I probably wouldn't ever eat here again, just because it isn't worth the time or money (it, like everything in Vegas was pretty pricey)."}
{"text":"Awww, I'm sad to see that this particular Anchor location at the Venetian food court has closed.

Food venues inside casinos - no matter how casual - are usually overpriced, so when I stopped by I was delighted to see that they offered a good amount of boneless wings at prices that weren't terribly inflated over, say, what you might get if you were to drive into a regular Las Vegas community. The wings were just a tad excessively breaded for my tastes but weren't bad at all.

Let's face it, being in Vegas can lead to lots of eating, particularly unhealthy eating at that. While boneless fried chicken wings aren't healthy by any means, this venue was still a decent way to get a good amount of protein fast and inexpensively. RIP."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Not sure what happened today. No one greeted at front stood there fore a couple of minutes and they said seat yourself. We asked the server to give us a few minutes. Like 10? Had to send nachos back overcooked. So wings came. Very different much larger but not cooked enough. Nachos came but not very good. My friend asked for another beer but server forgot. It was not busy. We had to get up and track her down. Never offered me a refill of my pop. Manager did come by and was apologetic. She reduced bill by half.
Disappointed in food and service.
Lots of other  places nearby."}
{"text":"We were happy to find this place in the food court at the Venetian. This is the \"original\" chicken wing (supposedly) from the same named bar in Buffalo, NY.

The wings were, of course, great. They were good sized, seasoned well and the sauce was not overly spicy. My wife and I shared a medium order.

We also shared the kale salad. It was good - it had blue cheese, cranberries, nuts and a raspberry vinegarette. My only complaint was that they should chop the kale up a bit more. There were some huge pieces that required some additional tools to not be overwhelming.

With all the other options in the food court (Chipotle, Panda Express, Johnny Rockets) this place certainly won."}
{"text":"My first impression was that Anchor Bar had just opened a few weeks ago.  The wait staff was very unorganized.  We were originally sat at a booth but when we sat down we realized that the booth was really small and tight so we asked to change to a table.  With out any issues we were moved but again the tables are very small especially for a restaurant that serves wings which require space for the scrap bones.  Our first waitress had not tried anything on the menu and was there for 2 weeks.  Not much feed back given there.  Our drinks were ordered and took quite a while to come.  After our order was taken a new waitress came over and advised us that she would be our new waitress.  She took our orders once again as she was not comfortable that the first waitress did it properly.  None the less she was on the ball and a great waitress to us for the rest of the evening.  I ordered the burger.  Not sure why I did that at a wing restaurant.  Well i learnt my lesson.  The burger came the bottom of the bun was so soggy that it felt like it was dipped in water or oil.  Would fall apart as soon as you touch it.  The burger patty itself was over cooked and super dry.  Even with the condiments i was choking on it.  The fries were really good.  Hand cut and crispy.  Partially through the burger i couldn't do it anymore so I sent it back.  The waitress was very understanding.  I swapped it for wings.  The wings came out very fast.  The wings were not the best that I have ever had but they were good.  Nice size, fully coated and tasty.  As for the restaurant it self its your typical sports bar.  Loud, TV's every where.  People cheering when their team scores.  I wont go out of my way to come here but I will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Got fried wings well seasoned with casino pricing. Very good, tasted home made.  Will return and try other things"}
{"text":"It was a little overrated. I have had better wings at albertsons. Also the prices were not very friendly. 2 orders of wings fries and drinks almost 50 bucks!"}
{"text":"Foods good, interior is beautiful, menu is narrow. This is the place where you take your kids to eat."}
{"text":"We had a Realtor function here and had a great time. Our server Safra and bartender Andrea are awesome. Manager Michelle made sure all was taken care of. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good wings awful service .  Waitress seemed to forget us.  No place to wait either. Very limited dessert menu."}
{"text":"I was expecting this to be an actual bar,  but it's essentially a counter service restaurant in a food court.   I tried the traditional and boneless wings with medium sauce and fries with Cajun spice.   The fries were the best part of the meal.   The were cooked just right - a little crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.   The wings were just average.   Overall,  the meal was just ok.   I probably will not go back.   There are better food options in Vegas, and I can get better wings at other chain restaurants at home."}
{"text":"The food at Etobicoke's Anchor Bar is honestly as good as the original in downtown Buffalo... BUT! There's just no value there. The prices are a bit high for what you get. Wings are close to $2 each! The decor is nice but there are some oddities. 

The space between the bench seats and table (where a beer-drinking, wing-eater's belly goes) is strangely narrow. And the urinals in the men's room are the highest I've ever seen. Kid's will have a problem.

I WANT to go back, but not without a coupon or promo bringing the wing prices in line with the many, many other places one can get decent wings."}
{"text":"I ordered the portobello sandwich as I was so excited to try it. I know this place is known for wings but I wasn't feeling wingey.

I should of stuck to wings. The sandwich was just not good  the bread wasn't warmed all the way through so when you bit into it it was cold doughy and gross. Waste of $10,   I tried my friends fries and they were incredibly salty. I tried a chicken wing boneless and not to bad. The have a buffalo spring pretty good until the after taste of plastic like taste comes in. I'm not sure if its because this place is new but it didn't leave a good impression. 



I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"The \"mild\" wings tended toward the hot, the beef on weck was adequate.  What was insulting was that after spending $30 on decent but not outstanding food, the manager charged us eighty cents for an additional bleu cheese container. Are you kidding me -- cheap and stingy is no way to grow your business. There are many other choices in the Venetian -- next time I will choose one of them."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Anchor Bar after Kelseys closed down. We watched with anticipation as they were renovating, waiting for their opening.

On Saturday Oct. 22, we were driving by around 4 pm and noticed that it was finally open so we decided to have an early dinner. 

We were greeted promptly and offered a table or a booth as it was not busy.

That is where the good part ended.

Our Server came over and took our drink order and within a longer time than we thought it should take, we received our drinks. We were about half way through our drinks when our Server returned to take our order.

My wife ordered Chicken Tender Melt and I opted for the Wing Dinner, because Anchor Bar invented the wings in Buffalo.

Our orders arrived and placed on the table. Our Server left and my wife looked at her plate and questioned me if this was what she ordered. We both received a Wing Dinner!

We looked for our Server and she was no where to be seen. So we flagged down the Receptionist and she found our Server.

Our Server came over and my wife told her that this was not what she ordered. Our Server immediately told her what the order should have been.

She removed the incorrect order and took it away. While she was gone, we discussed that possibly the Wing Dinner I ordered may not have been the flavour I ordered. As I have no reference, I could not say, but we both suspect that our orders were actually for another table and we both received some else's order.

To say the least... we were not impressed and feel that with all the other great wing places in Toronto - Wild Wing, Wingporium, Buffalo Wild Wing and St. Louis Bar to name a few - that Anchor Bar will not be hurting their business any time soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I had the wings and pizza. Both were great for this type of establishment. The wings were large and juicy and the pizza very flavourful. It's clean and large, great for hosting a large group of people. I recommend you try the wings here."}
{"text":"I'm a wing connoisseur and I enjoying venturing out to get wings wherever I am...so why not while in Vegas? 

Just a walk down from our awesome hotel (see my review on The Palazzo), this place is located within the food court at the Venetian. It's a nice stroll walking through the Grand Canal Shoppes and then entering a familiar mall-type food court...but don't let the simple atmosphere fool you.

Me and some friends came here around 4pm with no wait. We ordered 50 wings with 6 different flavors (the 5 unique flavors and 1 hot flavor) and the order only took about 20 minutes to make- very impressive! The wings were just so. freaking. delicious. Such yummy batter, great flavors, and large wing size... how I wish I was back in Vegas to eat these right now!! I would also like to add that the service was great and the employees were friendly.

Do yourself a favor and make a stop here while you're in Sin City."}
{"text":"Yes - these truly are the BEST hot wings you will ever have. So good that the rest of your Vegas trip, you will be finding ways to get back and have more. Great friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I was interested in this place since it was the \"original buffalo wings place\". I went on saturday night based on yelp hours since it said closed at 1am. I was happy that we got here at 1230, but the girl told us they were closed and the pizza place is still open late.. Then 2 minutes later, I saw her hand out food to other people.. I was sad and confused.. Maybe she just wanted to go home early.  I guess I'll try again the next time I come back to Vegas.. at like an earlier hour."}
{"text":"I went to the Anchor Bar for wings and wasn't disappointed. The wings were excellent! Staff and service was great"}
{"text":"So far the Onion Soup Delish!!! Very French,
The brick oven cheesy Bread with Bacon, I would eat 10 servings by myself!!! Bear cold and on my third!"}
{"text":"I went to the Anchor Bar (Toronto) for lunch with three of my friends and we all ordered the Wing Dinner (single order of wings, fries and coleslaw). Even though the wings were huge, they were cooked to perfection. I had the suicide and they were so saucy but next time I'll go for the \"Abandon Ship\" as it has ghost peppers. The coleslaw had thinly sliced red onions and I tasted a bit of horseradish, which was a nice contrast with the wings. The blue cheese dip that was served on the side was actual blue cheese and not some bottled Kraft salad dressing.

It's a very clean restaurant with a great vibe. The service was friendly, attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for our meals. The only little complaint I have is that the temperature of the wings could have been hotter but, overall, up there with some of the best wings I've had.

Someone at one the nearby tables ordered a pizza and it was thin crust and looked very appetizing. The server told us that the fish and chips are actually her favourite as it's haddock and Hickory Sticks are incorporated into the batter - YUM!

Each meal came to just under $30, including refillable soft drinks, tip and tax.

We all definitely plan to return with more of our colleagues!"}
{"text":"Had I only been here once, I would've given at least a 4 star. I ordered the double wings with Lemon Pepper and Hot flavors, and both tasted great. It came with celery and dressing. However, I liked it so much my first time I had to come back and try the other flavors. This time the experience was the complete opposite of my first. I ordered the Chipotle and Honey Ginger. The first problem was I couldn't even tell which was which. I'm used to Chipotle being a smoky, dry tasting flavor. But both flavors were covered in sauce. I took it back to the counter and asked what the flavors were, and the woman I ordered from initially said Terriyaki, but then realized I didn't order that flavor, and changed her answer to Chipotle. Needless to say, it was overly saucy. And on top of that, they added all the wings together, so the Honey-Ginger wings were doused in the flavors of the other wings. They obviously should have separated the two flavors of wings. At the end, I didn't even want to finish the last of the wings. I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars for a positive first experience. But they either mixed up my order the second time, or some of their wings just don't taste good. Either way, they dropped a few stars for an average of my two experiences there."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  We came here on a Sunday evening hoping to enjoy some good wings (to bring back memories of having yummy ones years ago in Buffalo).  Well.  The wings were sadly just short of mediocre.  So very disappointing.  The poutine was odd tasting.  Definitely subpar, limp, frozen fries swimming in a way-too-oniony gravy, with some not-fresh curds, and an odd white sauce poured over.  The first beer I was given was completely warm/flat so I asked for a different one. To our surprise, when we were walking out, we noticed they had charged for both (it wasn't a busy restaurant so it was strange).  They offered to pay us back in cash?  We declined and asked for a refund and then another check (as there was tax and tip involved).  They then refunded just the bill (not the tip).  It was just a very overall terrible experience.  I would never return."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. No real issues except staffing. They were short staffed so service was quit slow I ordered the Chicken Tenders meal. It was a surprising large meal. It was very tasty & a good size portion."}
{"text":"These chicken wings are the size of your big toe with a lot of chicken very tasty and they use a clean oil so the chicken taste fresh. They make their blue cheese fresh. it tastes so good better than ranch. However the ranch is a close second because that is also made fresh on site. The prices are high but that's because it's the strip. Even though the prices are high is worth the money. I cannot wait to try some of the other menu items. As a local I definitely  recommend it to locals and tourists alike. The worst part about this place is the wait. Because you get hungry and your mouth starts watering. And all you want is a giant chicken wing in your mouth besides your big toe."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Ismael and amazing food... Hoping Anchor will follow the myriad of NYers that transplanted to Southern California... We'd love to have you in LA!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch this afternoon at the Anchor Bar.

I knew that Anchor Bar in Buffalo claims to be the home of the original Buffalo wing (1964).  I like wings and figured I wouldn't be getting to Buffalo anytime soon so thought I'd check them out.

I ordered the Anchor Bar Original (8 pieces) with medium sauce and Ranch dressing.  I thought the wings were just okay and similar to those in other places ... I guess I had expected more considering their fame.  Plus I found them pricy ... 8.5 pieces for $16 and they were normal size, rather than jumbo.

I'm glad I tried them so I could see what all the fuss is about but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Good location at the Grand Canal shops which imo is the most relaxing mall in Vegas. They Wings where good, crisp and juicy. The fries i didnt like wish they improved the quality of those. 
All in all a 3.5"}
{"text":"I am from buffalo and have been to the original Anchor Bar on Main st. And this one in Vegas is just as good as the original. A must stop if your in Vegas. Best wings in Vegas and the blue cheese is amazing. I recommend to everyone. I'll be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with what they call the original chicken wing. Wings were below average and the waitress was disgustingly hitting on my freind. That's all this area needs another frozen food location."}
{"text":"Skip the dishes worked great and Anchor takeout was a nice change. Checked in for early dinner on 1/2 priced wine day. Can't believe she didn't order a glass. Shared medium wings(no spicy for her) and a Bacon Mac and cheeseburger. Seemed like a great Team Sports joint. Menu was surprising with lots to choose. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love chicken and chicken wings in general. Now, I place wings in two categories, either they're flavorful and moist or crispy and spicy. Now there is a small percentage where there is a fair medium and I think I found it. 

First, the wings are big, almost to that \"certain the bone is cracked somewhere inside from supporting all this meat\" size. Chicken I've only had from a Tyson brand wing, but then there's the flavored sauce that has a \"tang\" to it when I tried the \"hot\" with bone option, (they serve boneless too). The fries feel like an afterthought, not crispy or too soft, they are delicious but I expected some crispy fries and they removed their chipotle option which I thought might have been interesting. I choose the salt and vinegar but tasted nothing on the latter half.

The trick on the combo meal is how you eat it. Choose from ranch or blue cheese and if you don't mind the celery sticks, just put em' on the side to justify your self conscience choice that you at least had a veggie in your presence. Now, here's the trick. They hide a pool of \"awesome\" sauce for your fries under the wings, because that's where the good stuff is at for the floppy carb potatoe sticks called \"fries\". Dip em' and soak them up while you enjoy the wad of chicken on each chicken bone. Enjoy!

Food is fast served and delivered to sit down or take on your way like any awesome hangover nursing spot or grub place on the strip. Take some time if you're close by and enjoy this spot and the typical bar with original \"license plate\" aesthetic that somehow fits that \"diamond in the rough\" spot. Wing it up and try a beer on tap or three."}
{"text":"I went out for dinner with some co workers. We were actually were suppose to go to a different restaurant but I remembered that this place was new and just opened. We checked the menu and decided it was a go. upon arrival it took a while for us to get seated a good 10 minutes, but it wasn't busy at all, the place was fairly empty. 

The waitress saved that experience with an apology and she was super nice and gave us some good tips on what we should order.

Myself, being a wing lover of course ordered the wings, but I was not impressed with the flavor  however the size was of the wings were big. the wings lacked in flavor, very bland for some honey garlic, which was disappointing. I mean how can you be home of the buffalo wing, I am wishful for improvements. I did however enjoy the mac and cheese balls as well as the cheese burger bombs, so I am definitely recommending those. 

overall, I would still come here with some coworkers for lunch or after work for a bite to eat so its not completely out of the picture."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with not only the food and service received here. For all the hype Anchor Bar receives in both Buffalo and Toronto, you would think they could make an effort to insure their customers leave satisfied. I went with some coworkers for an evening meal, extremely slow service on the bar side, and should I mention we were the only patrons on that side of the restaurant. The bartender/server never introduced himself, was extremely distant during our entire visit and seemed to want to be anywhere else but working there. Apps came out very quickly and were fine, choosing from the calamari and fried pickles. After then, the issues began. It was another 25 minutes after we had our apps that our actual food order was taken. I ordered 8 wings, and my coworkers also ordered 8 wings and a white pizza. We waited another 30 minutes after our order was taken and still no food. Finally, 2 orders of wings came to our table and no pizza. The wings were stone cold and the bartender said the pizza was given to the wrong table by mistake. What? Lol after sending the wings back, another order came out 10 minutes later with the pizza. The wings were very light on sauce which is a cardinal sin with buffalo wings. If they are not messy, they are not good, simple as that. My coworker's pizza had no sauce on it and the ingredients were clearly from a frozen package. After voicing our concerns, the bartender said he would discount our meal, but when the check came, no discount was made. After that point we were all completely over the entire experience and simply paid and left. Just know I write for a food and travel website that has a solid following both on social media and via emailed newsletter, and this review will be highlighted on our site. Do yourself a favor and avoid Anchor Bar."}
{"text":"Came here last night, hg, short and sweet review is as follows:

Not like Buffalo. But an oh kay copy cat.  

my bbq wings were half naked, whereas at the original anchor they were suffocating in sauce; complete fckin mess there, as it should be with wings.

We ordered 3lb, looked like the 2lb in buff, cajun rub, mild, chipotle bbq. (bf cant handle the heat).

loved loved the cajun rub, it was lovely, i was expecting it to have a little bit more of a kick, but still yummy.

mild was like okay, but i had set my expectations high, 

chip bbq: half naked , still good.

anywayz, so far best wings in the gtaa, that i've had so far, but the low star rating is bc i just cant forget my eating frenzy at the origianl anchor bar. Which by the way we drove there for the day just for the wings.

i like chicken wings."}
{"text":"Very poor showing...I have been to the Anchor Bar in NY and this is a poor representation.  I had the hot wings which were under sauced. I only needed 2 napkins and if you have been to the original that should tell you something...I suggest getting your wings elsewhere"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here tonight through SkipTheDishes, chicken wings, chicken tenders with fries, and nachos. 
The chicken wings were alright, nothing special and definitely not as good as Orwell's, but just fine.  
The chicken tenders with fries were soggy in frying oil, and although we ordered mild, for the kids, they were quite hot even for adults. 
But the worse part of the entire order was the nachos. We paid extra for ground beef and didn't see any meat until we got to the bottom of the nachos. Well, I've never tasted beef that has spoiled but let me tell you that this meat was an assault on the senses. My husband and I were overwhelmed with an awful taste and smell coming from the beef once we'd taken a bite. 
We had no option but to throw away the nachos to avoid food poisoning. 

Do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all cost. There are way too many good restaurants and pubs in Etobicoke to put up with mediocre quality. 

Orwell's is still the king of wings!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, I purchased the single combo. I had it split in hot and medium wings... Mind you all I read some of the reviews prior to coming and I didn't let it deter me... I wish I had listen, it was slightly better than flavorless... Will not be returning. Also, they are stingy with the sauce, the lack of sauce could be contributing to the lack of flavor. The fries with Cajun seasoning was on point though."}
{"text":"As a lover of wings, I had to pay a visit to the place that created the original buffalo wing.

They are located in the food court of the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian.  They only have bar seating, but there are other tables around the food court.

When you first sit at the bar, there's a contraption on the countertop infusing bourbon with mint. They use it in their Southern Comfort drink which is pretty good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink bourbon.  Their Pineapple Express (16 oz/ $9) is a rum based drink that was more my style. It tasted like pineapple soda.

For a snack, I got a single order of wings and it was enough to share between two people.  A single order ($12) comes with 9 wings and you get a choice of two flavors.  I went with lemon pepper and mild buffalo.  Both were tasty.  The lemon pepper is a tangy zesty dry rub.  The mild sauce had enough heat to tingle my tongue but I could still enjoy the flavor.  

These were some of the best wings I've had.  They were meatier than your average wing and the flavors were on point.  The only problem is that there isn't a location closer to where I live."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited the restaurant on a Sat night. We had the canadian pizza and each got a pound of wings. We both got food poisoning and have been puking for more than 12 hours. Thanks anchor bar for ruining our new years eve weekend."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when my wife told me she saw The Anchor Bar while she was wandering  around the Venetian. I couldn't wait to try it & I was not disappointed. I ordered a double order of hot wings & my wife got the Anchor Strips & fries. My wings were large & perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside. My wife enjoyed her Anchor Strips & the fries were great as well. Perfectly seasoned & crispy. The only criticisms I could have was I was not a huge fan of the blue cheese and I wish the wings had a little more sauce on them. I tend to like more sauce so that is just a personal preference. I would just ask for extra sauce next time."}
{"text":"For what I was expecting, this place exceeded expectations.  Very good wings and a good drink special.   I really have nothing to complain about this place.  I ordered the hot and Cajun dry rub and both were very good. Hot wasn't super hot so I will probably spice it up a bit next time.  I also ordered my wings extra crispy as I usually do anywhere I go."}
{"text":"We just wanted something besides a buffet for dinner, so I found out that the Anchor Bar was close to our hotel room. It was a chance to try the original chicken wings, and we couldn't pass it up. We've had Wingstop, BW3, and other wing restaurants. And I have to say that the Anchor Bar wings are the best I've ever had. 

I ordered the single combo with a drink. That was 10 large and meaty wing pieces with a lot of their seasoned fries. You can have your choice of 2 sauces, and there are 3 different fry seasoning you can choose from. I tried the hot and teriyaki sesame sauces, with the AB seasoning on the fries.

My wife had the breaded chicken sandwich with hot sauce and fries. We immediately saw that one order of fries would have been enough for both of us. Both of us thought that the hot sauce wasn't really very spicy, but we are use to spicy food. The sauces did have good flavor and the wings were fried to perfection.

The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they had my wing order ready minutes before the sandwich order. So my order had to stay under the heat lamb and wait. My wings and fries were still of a good temperature, so it wasn't that bad. If I could, I'll give them 4.5 stars. And they're open till midnight."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are one of my \"secret\" cravings - I'll usually prefer them to other foods they're associated with (aka pizza). A good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as there's not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. It's quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves \"the original Buffalo Chicken Wing (tm)\", and \"the best wings in the world\". 

Anchor Bar continues the tradition of East Coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the West Coast (Shake Shack, White Castle). They are located in the Grand Canal Shoppes Food Court inside Venetian|Palazzo. They have limited seating in the actual counter but there's plenty of seating in the food court. When the No1DP and I were there they had samples of their boneless wings.

I got the Original Anchor Bar (Buffalo) Wing (medium spicy) with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a Pepsi ($14.50).
- Portion size was big enough for two people. Unlike chicken wings I've eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. The No1DP said that had he known the portion size was that big he would've been happy to share my combo.
- Anchor Bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. Usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. Each chicken wing was cooked properly.
- Celery sticks were thin but crisp.
- The bleu cheese sauce isn't strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries.
- Fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. This is the reason for the -1 star.

I had over half my food left so I gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the Palazzo to the Wynn. They looked like they needed food more than we did.

If split between two people it comes to around $7.25/person so I would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunch/dinner option in the Strip. They also serve other flavors of bone-in, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting."}
{"text":"This place is really close to the airport, and it serve some really good wings. I ordered a two pounds of wings (Maple Honey Garlic & Chipotle BBQ) and ask them to make it extra crispy. It was delicious and filling. The wings were big, and meaty not like a lot of other wing places where it is really small. I also order a popcorn shrimp as my appetizer. Overall, everything was good and I would be back if was in the area. Nothing really special, if you want to stop by for a quick bite, this could be your spot.

Service: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Environment: 3/5

Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Fabulous wings!!! I recently read about the original place in Buffalo. I was delighted to see it in Vegas. Spectacular!!! Great service, nice staff, perfect taste, fries look soggy but have good flavor too. Must try if you love wings!"}
{"text":"Good stuff i had the Chicken salad and it was Great!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings, awesome service. The appetizer suggestions were right on and the wings tasted fresh and delicious. They are served right in that wingdow when the meat is just perfect! Ask your waiter! Would definitely recommend it! Apps recommended: the deep fried pickles and popcorn shrimp! So good."}
{"text":"We were promptly seated by the bartender but left alone for about 10mins, the follow up was by the bartender. Turns out he was our server and boy was service slow. Got our apps and mains ordered but took about 25mins to get the nachos delivered. We ordered the small but at $16 a pop this should be enough for 3 people to share. Nope, lacking in every possible way. Mains came out 25 mins later, nothing to write home about. For an American joint portions were really small and mediocre in flavor and spice. One party member liked the burger and the fries were ok, but the rest of the ordered were just meh (soups, wings, pizza). 

This location must be cursed. First Crocodile Rock, then Croc Bar, then Stir now this. Prob won't go back, lots of tvs though so could be good for game night if you're patient with the amount of time for food to come out. Still think the Montana's nearby is the best corporate spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great drunk food, but difficult to find based on the maps within the Venetian. After the 3rd employee the boyf and I asked we found this place. The lady gave me way more wings since it was the end of the night and didn't charge for the extra sauce. Wasn't a fan of her flirting with the boyf but it was hilarious at the same time."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I came across the Anchor Bar at the Venetian.  I had not been to the original on in Buffalo over ten years.  

I planned on getting wings, but when I saw they had another specialty sandwich, Beef on a Weck, I wanted to have it again. 

Staff wasn't overly friendly, but it is essentially a food court in Vegas.  

Fries were good and so was the Weck bread.  However, Much of the beef was chewy and really inedible and had to toss out much of the sandwich. 

While I did not have them, the wings looked good.  Just stay away from the Beef on a Weck!!"}
{"text":"I had been to the original Anchor Bar in Buffalo NY so I was excited to check this out. 

Anyway, while the atmosphere can't compare to the originally location, the quality can! The wings tasted almost identical and so did the fries!

Why not a 5 - star? The service was slow during the time I went on labor day. It took over 45 minutes to get my food - who wants to wait that long for food in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Little factoid before we start: Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY are the originators of the buffalo wing... I got to check out the original location a few years back so I had high expectations of this place. 
We are seriously spoiled to have Anchor Bar and all of the other east coast specials in Vegas. You can literally relive my east coast eats tour without leaving the city (making list soon) Amazing!
I got a large 1/2 bbq and 1/2 hot to share with the family. Man, the wings were just like I remember them..
Large crunchy chicken wings sauced perfectly, not like the mushy tiny chicken fetus wings you get at Wingstop. Nothing beats the original; nothing...

I hate to make a 5* review so short but it's all you need to know.. 
This is the only place in my book to get legitimate buffalo wings in Vegas from now on."}
