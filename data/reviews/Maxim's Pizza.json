{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in all of Cleveland. This pizza is a throw back to days gone by. I mean they are still made in the original ovens! There is nothing else like it. The ground pepperoni and anchovies are my personal favorite combo, and they have a  great selection of toppings. I have been in many times and have not had a bad meal. From the egg plant parm to the home made meatballs I am impressed. The service and family are also amazing people that make you feel like family. Give them a call and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took family to eat last night.  What a great surprise!  This is the best kept secret in Mentor.  The food is awesome!  Best pizza I have had in years.  Friendly and family owned.  Place is small but excellent  Italian food.  Must add they have a great selection of take out also.  It is now one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"This place is very big on good homemade healthy food but a bit lacking on the dining experience. They're much more suited for carryout but do not lack in food quality. Pretty close to authentic Italian reminds me very much of going to my Italian grandmothers house.  The food is handmade and all processed in the store. You can tell nothing here is can or mass processed."}
{"text":"Brought back fond memories when they where in cleveland. Great pizza am looking forward to trying one of their subs"}
{"text":"Maxims Pizza is my all time favorite Italian food! Everything is homemade and fresh! My favorite is of course the pizza .. The sauce is so flavorful and the crust is the perfect consistency. All of the sandwiches are so filling and original. The manny with the homemade roast beef, the mean gene sausage sandwich on two pieces of white pizza, and the deli meat rock sandwich will not disappoint. I also love that I can buy groceries there as well like there pizza dough to make it at home! In a day where everything is so impersonal and generic ... Maxims makes you feel at home and welcomed. Great wine and dessert options as well! The brownies and cheesecake are to die for!!! I rarely meet someone who hasn't shared with me a story about how they too grew up eating maxims... It's too good not to love!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I use to go there as a kid. When they had their shop on E 185th. still as I remember it. The homemade bread. The pizza bagels,  are top notch. There deserts are great as well. I love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Good prices, great home made food and quick delivery!  You can't best Maxim's!  Check um out!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Lake County! They always have fresh pizza available by the slice at cheap prices. Also, the Berardinelli family is so wlecoming and friendly whenever you go in."}
{"text":"I have currently only been to Maxim's once due to the fact that my mother works with one of the owners relatives, so for Christmas she gave my mom a ten dollar gift certificate we finally decided to go. Walking in the place smelled so good that I instantly know what I had to try...EVERYTHING!  As we looked at the menu we decided on one 10 inch meat ball sub (don't be stupid get the 12), the mean gene, a corn beef sandwich, garlic cheese bread, and two different pieces of pizza. First off let me get the bad out of the way it is the tiniest thing and amends have been made... We ordered mozzarella sticks they forgot to give them to us and have since then contacted us and apologized several times and want us to come back AND  we will. Everything we had was so good it smelled so good in there we ended up having to grab the slices of pizza on our way home just because we couldn't wait to get home and eat. The dough for the pizza was amazing, the sauce was very good too. I only had a bite of the mean gene and I gotta say yes sooo many yeses. I loved the meat ball sub was so good the meat balls were so big they almost didn't fit, and the corn beef was well really good. The cheeses garlic bread was almost as good if not as good as pizza parlors if you were ever there and had it you will understand. I gave this place 5 stars because they were good best I have had in a long time I can't wait to try more bust mostly I am dying to try their wedding soup. So hopefully another update coming soon"}
{"text":"Family-owned restaurant with delicious pizza, subs, sandwiches, pasta, fresh-baked bread and pastries.  Awesome food!Awesome family!"}
{"text":"I have used Maxim's for cross country pasta nights for my kids, for a huge graduation party and most recently for my son's wedding.  The staff is friendly, accommodating and professional.  The food is fresh and delicious and portioned nicely for catered events.  I really appreciate these folks and would definitely recommend them for your next event.  Looking for great pizza and subs, they have that too!  I can't say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"I've had the food from here a few times and am MOST impressed with their customer service. They treat people very kind. The food is homemade with scratch ingredients...also, impressive.   I am not a huge fan of their style of pizza, too heavy on the bread side, but my family likes it, especially the ground pepperoni. Last night I ordered a white style pizza with banana peppers and pepperoni. I will admit, it was DELICIOUS! The bottom of the crust had a nice crisp to it with great chew to the bread. Maybe the olio sauce made all the difference for me. The prices do seem a tad high, a six piece square cut pizza and large order of seasoned hand cut fries came to $14 & some change.  The shop has plenty of items to take and eat, or you can call and order. They also cater. I will check them out next time I am in need for that."}
{"text":"Scam, placed order on Slice app. Never received confirmation. I called maxims and was told they do not deliver where I am at (15 min away). The slice app is linked on their webpage and is the only way to order delivery from them. Why do they not have accurate location information.   The order was placed and paid for through their website. When I asked about this I was told that's my problem.   Stay away!"}
{"text":"Great food and great people. I've been a customer since I was a kid and they were on E185th street in Euclid. Now that we live close to them again it's our place of choice! Way better than your run of the mill pizza chains!!"}
{"text":"I love Maxim's!   My family has been regulars since the old days of 185th. This is your local convenient store & so much more. Stop for lunch & eat in or takeout. Whether you choose a loaded deli sandwich or the old world style pizza, you can't go wrong. Don't forget to grab those last minute items for home later! This family owned business is a gem in Mentor! #supportlocalbusiness"}
{"text":"We are trying to find a new good restaurant around us.  We decided to try Maxim's.  When I brought it home and opened the box, I realized that they must only have one box that has to fit all the sizes of their pizzas.  We ordered a large, which, obviously, they do not have large pizza boxes.  To accommodate this feat they wrap some of the hot square pizza slices in plastic wrap and put them on to of the rest of the pizza.  This causing not only the top slices to slide off the bottom slices and thus taking the topping off the bottom, but when you try to remove the hot slices from the  plastic wrap it takes the topping off of those.  When I called to complain, the young man actually laughed and said, \"That is how we always do it.\"  The pizza itself was bland, not worth trying to eat the rest of the globbed up slices.  Never again."}
