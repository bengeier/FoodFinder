{"text":"This place has great pizza & good drink specials (& live music occasionally!). Try the chilled shrimp cocktail for a nice app (pay per shrimp, very reasonable)!"}
{"text":"Go with the bbq chicken pizza. Skip the peppers. Dang good pizza. I can never eat the entire thing. It's enough for two meals. I'm a repeat customer. The only problem is service can be slow."}
{"text":"If you haven't seen the beautiful deco bar in this building I highly recommend popping in for a cheap draft beer, and if you're hungry, well, the pizza isn't half bad. Actually the pizza is great. There are plenty of vegetarian options, and more than just the old standards. The thick crust is, from what I hear, quite like Garcia's back in their heyday. Which is to say that it's really tasty.   Oddly the proprietors aren't \"burners\" or at least that's what our waiter said. They put a little Burning Man in their logo and named their pizza place after the desert where Burning Man is held... that's some coincidence!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night a few weeks back. We ordered cheese bread, artichoke dip, and a thin crust pesto pizza. The cheese bread was pretty solid--crisp and very buttery. The artichoke dip was not so great. There seemed to be a lot of ricotta in it, which I sort of hate, and it was pretty spicy. The portion was out of control, I would have been perfectly happy with half of it in a less-ricotta-y formula. The pesto pizza was the real letdown, though. The crust was the cheep crackery kind you expect from a frozen piece. The sauce was mostly tasteless, the chicken was not fresh but the processed refrigerated kind. The worst, though, was the sheer amount of parsley. It was just an unbearable amount of parsley. The service was fine, but I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Black Rock Pizza Co. is opening in the former Red Star Liquors space at 114 S. Race St., U. Longtime residents may remember it as the home of The Embassy tavern. Black Rock will sell thin-crust pizzas for lunch, supper and late night.  They also have hot grinder sandwiches & salads.  Chilled cocktail shrimp is displayed on ice. Just displayed.  Black Rock has live music during \"happy hour\" on Fridays.   The pizza joint will still have the old Embassy's classic back bar.   The place will be brighter lit than in Red Star Liquor days but sadly, in compliance with a new federal law for mediocre restaurants, will have dozens more TVs than customers want.  Tattoos and nose-piercings will not be required as when it was Red Star."}
{"text":"I must change my review.  I truly loved this place the first time we went.  It was cozy, the pizza was good and the service was excellent. Our waiter was so attentive and helpful. The sauce was sweet and pizza crispy and thin.  Based on that we went there again a couple weeks later and got a completely different vibe.    The place was empty, we were 1 of 3 tables, and there was one person at the bar.  With that being said, the waitress was horrible. She spent most of her time setting up the area for the guitar player. After waiting 10 minutes for our drinks to come we inquired when it would arrive and asked if we could order.  She seemed upset with us and proceeded to be even more rude than before.  The service got worse as the night went on.  We waited 45 minutes for a pizza and we were told it was because there was another pizza in the oven.  I don't understand how an establishment can be run with an oven that only accommodates a single pizza.   The pizza - not good.  The sauce is very sweet, which I appreciate, but there was entirely too much of it.  We were scrapping the sauce off the pizza.  There was so much sauce that the cheese and toppings wouldn't stay on.  We ended up not eating it and just asking for the check.  She made us wait 20 minutes for that too.   The first experience was a 5 star one, and this was a one star.  I based my review somewhere in the middle.  The restaurant needs to work on consistency. I was really rooting for it, but they let me down."}
{"text":"Black Rock was pretty great. It's definitely a townie joint, but that's totally cool by me. The lighting is good, atmosphere is pleasant, the music was a bit loud, but the service was top notch.  Three of us went for dinner and also got some appetizers (y'know, try the place out, right?). The appetizers weren't too expensive, except that there definitely wasn't enough for three; the garlic bread was pretty standard fare, but the hummus plate had a really strange Hummus:pita ratio that skewed heavily in favor of hummus, meaning that we were left with the awkward situation of figuring out how we were going to consume the rest of the hummus. It was delicious, though, so it wasn't a chore by any means.  However, dinner is where this place shines. We ordered the pesto pizza and I still dream of that pie at night. The thought of getting another one keeps me up at night. The crust is thin, but not annoyingly so like Rosatis; the sauce is rich, but not super wet (no sloppy droopy pieces), and everything on top was absolutely marvelous.  Long story short, we resolved to just skip appetizers in the future and order a small pie to go alongside the big one. Black Rock is definitely worth the trip to Downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"My friends and I were just passing through Urbana and found this restaurant on Yelp.  The deco bar is gorgeous, the place is clean and well managed.  We had pizza and salad which were excellent as well as reasonably priced. Staff were attentive and very friendly.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for lunch or dinner! Everything is high quality! The pizza is good - thin crispy crust with a combo of cheeses. But my real favorites have been:  -shrimp cocktail, 50cents per shrimp, order as many as you want, and delicious cocktail sauce -greek salad! Finely chopped greens with feta all over and a great Greek dressing! -antipasto plate. I could seriously eat this every day!! The toast that comes with it is so good. Highly recommend it! Definitely try this place, and don't forget about their non-pizza menu items!"}
