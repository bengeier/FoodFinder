{"text":"The food is good, service was good and the price was excellent!. Small family owned place with a good selection!."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my go to spot for breakfast/lunch for about the last year. Once you step in the feeling is like a mom and pop shop with personalized service every time.   They have daily specials here during the weekday and a variety of sandwiches and platters on the menu. The food is always fresh here with excellent salads for healthier options. I will continue to dine here and have recommended this place to my colleagues."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Generous portions.  Fair prices. Warm hospitality.  Enthusiastic owners.  Charming atmosphere.   Will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"I've been there many times. Always fresh tasty food. Incredibly clean everywhere. Prices are good and you won't leave hungry. Paul and Maryanne take good care of you. They know the vast majority of the customers by name and its a very friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for a quick lunch with coworkers and friends. As the other review said, you will not leave hungry. The owner works it with his wife and they will ask you If theres enough food on the plate and put more If you're starving.  Pretty much 10$ for any platter meal, veal parmesean with pasta and salad, or rice and veggies. You can substitute or combo anything, they're simply happy to serve you.  Tuna sub covered in toppings and a huge greek salad was 9$ and sooooo tasty!  Good drink selection too, I like that he carries V8. I go here when im feeling picky because I know Paul will let me order whatever i want."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here. Family run restaurant, very clean, nicely furnished and friendly service. You can tell this place takes pride in what they do. I had the steak and eggs. The quality of the steak was much better than i expected, usually the steak they use in a breakfast steak and eggs isnt the best. The portion size was good, i left full and the prices are fair. The owner even had his son working there who looked around 12-14. He seemed to be doing a great job. It is nice to see a father instilling a good work ethic in his son from a young age. Nothing really negative to say."}
{"text":"Great find and amazing service. The food is so flavorful and well portioned. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Really friendly folk and they seem to remember the names of all the regulars here. Owned by a husband and wife duo, they offer a very simple menu. I like to try their everyday specials so you can really taste a bit of everything.  Food tastes good. Nothing really unique I'd say but it's basically a nice stop for a nice sandwich or salad or say parmesan chicken on rice.. The specials aren't actually priced differently by much though... But you do get a salad everytime so it's a decent balanced dish for a meal.  They are really really friendly and that's why people will always return :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered take-out from this place this afternoon. I can honestly say that it was one of the most dissatisfying meals I have ever eaten. If Costco can serve you a big juicy hotdog for 75 cents, these people can serve me better than a horrid excuse for a veal cutlet on bargain bin rice for 10 dollars.  Terribly small portion sizes, food is subpar at best.  Would advise any and all against coming to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Really sweet spot we found for breakfast as we had business nearby. Great value, nice service and very clean. The owner was on premises and was very helpful telling us about the area."}
