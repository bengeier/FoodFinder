{"text":"Chicken shawarma is the best! Chicken shawarma plate is also very delicious.. try everything on the menu if you can lol! Yummy"}
{"text":"Big fan of their shawarma plates.  I usually get the mixed plate with half chicken and half beef. Today I tried their falafel wrap and it was great.  They make the falafel fresh and it was delicious.  Would definitely go back for it again. If you're in the area definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this place awhile back as he really enjoys their shawarma plates.  I had their chicken shawarma wraps and must admit it's one of the best ones I've had.  The location surprised me as it is mostly Vietnamese and Jamaican foods in the vicinity so it's good to have more variety around.   The chicken is really good and tender, the customer service has always been friendly all the times that we have visited and the food is hot.  I always ask for extra onions in my wrap and they sure load lots of it inside making it sooooo good.    There aren't much cons to the restaurant except that it gets a bit hot in the summer as I remember sweating a bit eating inside.  But I can't call that a real complain as I rather sweat in the summer than freeze in the winter."}
{"text":"Pretty pleased. Chicken Platter and chicken sandwich ordered x2 by uber. Chicken is cooked perfectly, no grease or over cooked chunks of chicken. Rice was the thicker yellow kind which I love, sauces are made on site last time I went in and talked to the owner. Great salad choice and they have turnips (so rare now!) and parsley. I'm really happy with the service and food at this place and ate here 4 times."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Knows my order. Good portions though more expensive than other places but worth it."}
{"text":"Such a great and under appreciated (IMO) place in the area. The staff is very friendly. The shawarma wrap and plates are really good. The rice has a very nice hint of flavour to it. From my understanding the hot sauce is home made and it's by far my favourite from any shawarma/doner joint! I've been coming here for a long time and will continue to do so. Definitely my recommendation for lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"Solid shawarma spot! These guys have great service and are generous with meat and toppings. Love the chicken, not sure if I'm into the beef since it's almost like gyro meat"}
{"text":"Always seen this place while coming down lawrence, but recently had the chance to try it.   Food speaks for itself. Its really good. The chicken is well seasoned and the beef is full of flavor. I personally dont like falafel but from here it tastes good especially if you get falafel balls in the chicken shawarma sandwich. The chicken and beef kabobs take some time to cook, but you can always call in to make an order. Veggies are fresh.  Washrooms are always clean.  Good portions.  Garlic sauce is so good, home made, as is the hot sauce.  Owner will charge extra for extra sauce or veggies, but other employees wont unless hes around.  Samosas are always crispy, new batch comes in weekly.  Prices are decent, and the owner is super nice"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick bite. I learned that red and white stands for: red meat and white meat. LOL  Basic place. Nothing too exciting.  I had the chicken shawarma and asked them to cut it off the rotisserie itself and they obliged.  Just a little bit of hot sauce is very good. I enjoyed it and I would eat from here again.  Cash and debit only.   I recommend it."}
{"text":"Would go here cause I work close by.  Location is nice, little bland, but some seating to enjoy. Not the nicest area, but sometimes that is where you find gems like this one.   I would usually get a shawarma on rice with the hot sauce mixed in. It was drooling (literally, i drooled a few times cause was hungry and it looked sooooo good).   Recommend if you're in the area, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and the shawarmas were delicious. The decor is nothing special. The prices were pretty average compared to other shawarma places but this place was definitely my favourite just because of how good it was.   Will be coming back again :)"}
