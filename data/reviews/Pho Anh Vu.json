{"text":"It's a little hidden, but Pho Anh Vu is my top choice for Vietnamese cuisine north of Steeles. I didn't come to this evaluation suddenly. I've eaten at a lot of Pho houses in Vaughan, Markham, Richmond Hill, and so far Pho Anh Vu reigns supreme. It's a combination of things that leads me to feel this way: service, cleanliness, decor, location, and above all the offering and taste. 

The taste is genuinely flavourful, clean, fresh, well-prepared and well-presented. Some \"upscale\" places are lacking authenticity, while the most authentic places are cheap dirty dives. Pho Anh Vu is an excellent balance of both. Their menu is simple and does not confuse, covering all the standard menu items with some Thai cuisine mixed in. 

The spring rolls are a must for an appetizer. They are plump, yes, plump! Stuffed with a very hearty filling and nice light crispy wrapper. The paired fish sauce is not overly salty (or fishy, don't be afraid you newbies!) and the hot chilli sauce is quality stuff, extremely fragrant with fresh red chilli pepper aroma, I'm willing to bet it's home made. 

The rice dishes are great, crumbly rice but fresh made, not old or dry. Grilled meats are perfectly marinated and smokey. The fried egg is just right with a runny yolk. But what stands out to me is they serve hot broth with their rice dishes, which is an absolute must! Well done! Most places don't offer this anymore. 

The staff are friendly and the place is suitable for families. With plenty of parking. 

Bottom line, if you're in Maple, you've got to eat here.

Two thumbs up for Pho Anh Vu."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for supper with my sister. The restaurant is located in a newer plaza area along Jane Street and I wouldn't have known about this place if it weren't for my sister. She saw advertisements on Facebook and wanted to try this place out. 

My sister ordered Bun thit nuong with cha gio (Vermicelli with grilled pork and spring rolls), while I ordered chicken pho. The spring roll here is made the traditional, using rice paper rolls. This gives a more chewy texture, which I like. 
The chicken pho was made with chicken broth and was very flavourful without being overly salty. I also asked for Vietnamese coriander as it compliments the chicken perfectly and the server happily accommodated my request. The pricing here is reasonable and the portions are generous. 

The décor in this restaurant is very modern and clean, I like that there are booths along with the standard tables. The ambiance is nice, and I feel like it'll be a good place for a date. 

This area is pretty much out of the way for me and is not somewhere I would frequent but my experience has been really good and the food is good too so I'll definitely come back here.

This place didn't get a full 5 stars because the server forgot my bean sprouts and I'm pretty sure the owners were having an intense argument which was awkward and uncomfortable (The wife was angrily yelling at the husband to pick up their child from school next time lol)."}
{"text":"Out of all of the Viet places I've tried in Vaughan so far, this is the best one.

I've had their Pho, Bun Bo Hue, and Bun Rieu. All of them are pretty good- not just compared to Vaughan quality Viet food.

The noodle portions are a tiny bit smaller than some of the other places nearby, but they definitely have better quality dishes, fresher vegetables, and overall tastier food-- I always end up full after eating here anyways. The quality of toppings also makes up for the noodles. PLUS, the tables are NOT sticky. Whaaat?!

Pho ($9.50): nice light but flavourful broth. Would eat again. I got an extra large and that was just enough to fill me up during a very hungry lunch day.

Bun Bo Hue($9.50): very flavourful, does not have the pork foot you get sometimes get in Bun Bo Hue, but still pretty good, really hearty and savory. Very lemongrass-y. A good, very moderate, level of spice.

Bun Rieu($10.50): similar base broth to the Bun Bo Hue, but instead of super hearty savoriness from pork and beef, it has a lot of crab and tomato flavour, and even more fish sauce flavour. It is topped with a cut up, partially cooked Roma tomato, fried tofu, pork blood curd, and a huge chunk of crab/egg cake. The vegetables they give you are the same as the Bun Bo Hue, except for the sliced red cabbage. This time, I had to put the red chili in to the soup because I forgot this dish is not originally spicy.

The only thing about this place is the wait during lunch is insanely long. If you have a half hour and want to grab a quick pho, this is not your place. Satisfy your craving after work when it's completely dead."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a neighbourhood realtor I ran into.  It's a little known gem in Concord.

We enjoyed this restaurant thoroughly.  Invited another family and had three hungry kids sitting at the table in total.  Food was fantastic and we ordered from an array that included the Pho, pad thai, and many others.  Service was with a smile."}
{"text":"Came to dine in here for the first time and it was a good experience.  Their pho is delicious, formal and very clean place and friendly owner. A little bit costly but it's worth it."}
