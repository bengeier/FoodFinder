{"text":"I was very disappointed by this restaurant. The food was mediocre and uninteresting.  It was pricey paying $61 including tip for a family of 2 adults and 1 child.  We had steak and eggs, grilled cheese and a kid's waffle.  They charged $2.95 more for 4 small pieces of banana that was added to the waffle making it a $9.95 half a waffle!  It was the frozen type and was hard.  I had to cut it for our 10 year old.  The restaurant was cold and lacking in style of decor.  Service was fine but a little slow.  I was very disappointed in this just brunch restaurant lacking in any sense of originality, taste or uniqueness."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast at this place, the food is good, right temperature, friendly and welcome services. You must try! No regret!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch there.  Not impressed.  Veggie burger was the frozen type out of a box and SMOTHERED in mustard... literally dripping off.  Boring, cheap bun.  Greek salad mediocre. Dressing tasted like it was out of a bottle.  I could of had a better meal at home.  Don't waste your time or money. Only positive:  waiter was a nice guy.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Three of us dined Saturday noon for $60 with mixed results. 

The Good: The omelette and huevos rancheros were both delicious (so I'm told) and generous in size.  Service, when we got it, was cheery. 

The Bad: Service was painfully slow, 20-30 minutes from ordering to serving, 10-15 between plate pickup and cheque. Much has been said about the dated decor, but my son sat in a chair so dated that had so much give to it that I thought it might topple. 

The Ugly: In a word, blintzes. Not that they were truly blintzes (at least the menu acknowledged that they were crepes), and not that the mango compote served with them was truly compote by any definition I understand (more like mango chunks in a juice syrup). There was cheese filling, not enough that I could see, but I could taste it there. I can attest that previous commenter's suggestion that they use canned whip cream wasn't true today; mine could have used another 30 seconds whipping so that it would stand up. Yet, these concerns didn't kill the experience for me. 

Killer 1: You need to understand, I'm a sweet tooth. As I write, I'm drowning my sorrows in farmers market fudge. This is a step down in sweetness from the blintzes. It was just shy of inedible (and I'm confident most people I know wouldn't have been as generous). I'm not sure what part was the problem, but in addition to the visible icing sugar, I could feel sweet crystals the size of turbinado sugar as I ate. If I had thought I could have gotten a replacement before the sun set, I would have sent it back. 

Killer 2: In the farmers market behind this building, there is a stand that sells crepes for about $8. I'd consider this (pardon the pun) market price. So, when I ordered a $16 dish, I expected 2 crepes. I got one 8\" crepe, cut in half. I'd have been happy paying $8-10 for what I got (well, less grumpy), or getting 2 crepes for this price, even with all the previously mentioned shortcomings. Nope. I felt incredibly ripped off, and then to top it off, I got to stew in that feeling while I waited for the bill. (Hint to restauranteurs: if you're going to burn a customer, get them out the door *FAST*.)

If you're not on a budget, you may have a good meal here, but our party batted only 66%. Given the consistently better experiences we've had literally a stones throw from this front door, I'd find it hard to recommend this place."}

{"text":"I'm hoping that this review finds you who reads it well... this review solely speaks to the quality and sheer size of the breakfast offerings here AND not to mention the unique gastro-style offerings on their \"best of Brunch\" menu. 

Aesthetically from the outside this place looks clean and neat, inside it's dated and kinda blas√©. Then again when you're looking for a breakfast joint are you looking for sleek and sexy? Or are you looking for greasy, unique, hearty and friendly? I don't know about you... but I'm for the latter. 

Visiting a friend in Newmarket we decided to visit the farmers market and then make a quick brunch stop. We popped in, turned our noses up a touch at the appearance of the place (not dirty or anything of that sort... just plain jane) but paused as experience crept in and I recalled that old \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" saying. 

The staff was incredibly friendly throughout. Maybe it was that they weren't entirely busy when we paid them a visit, but our server was attentive, jovial, made excellent suggestions, even cracked a couple of jokes with us (all the while keeping our coffee and waters topped up). It's really not that hard to be an excellent server, they show you how easy it can be at Just Brunch.

On to the menu, for brunch they offered all the basics, and when I say basics I'm talking 3 pages of \"basics\". Eggs, Omelets, Sandwiches, Waffles, Pancakes, French toast, etc. But then there was the \"best of\" portion of the menu (which occupied an entire front page of the menu) filled with options that make my mouth water even mentioning them now. Huevos Rancheros? Blintzes? Cheddar Bacon Pancakes? Caramelized Banana Waffles? Yep! Things of that nature - deadly!

Ever the glutton, I flirted with the idea of the \"Big Breakfast\" ($12.95) for several minutes (because you know I like to try a bit of everything) before finally ordering it. The BB comes with harvest sausages, hand cut pemale bacon (hand cut to order), bacon, eggs, toast and home-fries (potatoes). 

- Bacon was plate length after it was cooked and had a smokey taste to it. Yum #1
- Pemale was like a mini pork chop, thickest cut I've ever seen and moist. Yum #2
- Sausages were HUGE, thick, juicy and cooked on a flat-top and grill instead of deep fried. Yum #3
- Eggs+Toast were cooked perfectly and toasted to my exact specifications. Yum #4
- Potatoes weren't so good, inconsistently cooked, however I typically don't eat home fries (takes up too much stomach space). 

4 stars earned for the food, another for service and another for clean and well maintained bathrooms! The only negative note as I mentioned was the potatoes but by the time I got to them I was too full to care. 

Definitely one of the most under-rated breakfast/brunch joint in the 'burbs that I HIGHLY recommend you give a try! Newmarket Main St's culinary prowess is beginning to impress me with it's bevvy of options. Now even at breakfast time too!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"$40 breakfast for 2? This is not the Grand Hyatt.  I stopped in early on a Saturday morning, and looked over the menu at some really encouraging selections.  I defaulted to my \"test platform\", Eggs Benedict.  My breakfast guest had the Crepes with Strawberries.

Of course I checked if the Hollandaise would be fresh or from a mix.  I was pleased to hear it was fresh.  When my abundantly large plate arrived, I could see that the Hollandaise was indeed fresh, but broken-not creamy, but a soup of egg yolk and butter that had separated.  But the peameal bacon was thick and tender, and the eggs were poached perfectly.  The home fries are rustically chopped potatoes, nicely seasoned and not deep fried.

My guest's Crepes were heavy and soggy, covered in what looked like canned whipped cream instead of fresh.  A big portion doesn't make up for the food quality.

To compare, The Buttery serves a perfect Eggs Benny for less money.  Also, the Buttery has a nicer environment, not dated \"dusty rose\" paint and tacky AM radio delivering static and bad banter.  And anyone serves better crepes for half the cost.  The crepe stand in the Farmer's Market behind the restaurant makes awesome crepes for $7.  For 2 people, this was a $40 breakfast that should have been closer to $26 with tax and tip. 

I would certainly give it another try, but it is too expensive to chance, unless I hear from someone that either the prices have come into line, or the quality rose."}
{"text":"I can see why the reviews are all over the map.  The food is actually not bad.  The pancakes looked excellent and so did the pina colada french toast.  

The decor needs a updating the walls were a pinkish purple colour and it looked dated and sad.  I think a new paint colour and some re-upholstery would go along way to make things better.  

The waitress we had was ok, she brought every one the correct food but wasn't overly attentive with coffee, didn't bring everyone water when asked and was slow to bring the bill around.  I would be willing to go again but my husband advised me he wasn't keen to go back."}
{"text":"Sad place for bruch. Outdated looking, tired and dirty. For instance, brass railings were dull, tables chipped and wobbly, weird music playing that wasn't right for the atmosphere of a day time restaurant. Just thoughtless. This place is clearly neglected and you can tell the owners are bored of running a restaurant. Only 2 staff running the place, dirty plates piled up everywhere. Coffee wasn't refilled, couldn't get any waters. Food was OK but there are way better places to get breakfast brunch in Newmarket such as Daybreak. I won't be back."}
