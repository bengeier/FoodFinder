{"text":"patrons be warned!  This resto is below par in food quality and service.  We found a hair in our food and my son's lamb dinner was so salty, it was inedible.  The chef/owner came over ready to argue and didnt offer anything just basically told us we were not welcome in their restaurant, to leave and never come back.  the waitress told my husband to \"f-off\"  .. I have never ever been to an establishment as unprofessional, and tasteless as the cedar grill.  Consider yourselves warned!"}
{"text":"They have THEE BEST chicken shwarma & fatouche salad in York region!!!"}
{"text":"Went in there and my shoes immediately were stuck to the floor it was so filthy. I couldn't believe it. Went to order my chicken shawarma and the guy kept saying he was short staffed and speaking another language to some other worker. Then, he asked his son to go get something from the bakery across the street as he ran out. So disorganized!! I doubt this place will last long..."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The chicken shwarma is fantastic. The beef shwarma is served well done so if that's not your thing, stick with the chicken. The starter salad is fresh and zesty. And you get pita and hummus for the table included. So bring your appetite. The falafel app was unnecessary, but delicious and filling.
The service is ok. A little disinterested but friendly enough.
My main complaint is pace. The last time we were there, our app, salad and meal were all on the table at the same time. Along with our hummus and pita. It was overwhelming. Would suggest ordering your app, then waiting until done before ordering your meal.
Finally the prices are pretty reasonable for all the good food you get.
Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Portions pretty decent!  Got the large, shoudl've got the regular portions.  The falafel was pretty yummy.  Took a while to get the order, but will come again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first experience was wonderful. The second time I brought my husband whose palate has rarely ventured past typical North American fare. A review of our date night: they didn't carry the beer he ordered, strike 1. He ordered a chicken shawarma, which the server told us they've run out of, strike 2. Instead, he ordered the beef shawarma and it was so dry and burnt, even I declared it unpalatable, strike 3. Two other things that they didn't have going for them: meals were supposed to include fries, but really, it was one potato wedge. Finally, the big draw is supposed to be belly dancers and no, they weren't there, either. I was the closest thing they had to entertainment, at the very least, for my husband, who was looking for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now; from old owners to new ones. I'm going to talk about the new owners & how they fare. I've had the Falafel a few times. Sometimes they are dry but I think it's because it's densely packed;meaning they don't skimp in putting fillers in the chick pea blend. Now it seems to depend on who makes the falafel because I've had it when it's a little more moist. 
Let's talk about the Chicken shawarma I've had numerous times & never disappointed. Always good portion of chicken & seasoned mildly(in my opinion) not a bad thing. I've had it in a pita wrap which is my favourite way. But if you want a \"dinner\" size food then the shawarma plate is the way to go. Comes with rice & potatoes.
I recently tried the beef & was pleasantly surprised it was moist & tasty. Good for the new owners to have remedied that issue from past owner. 
The Garlic sauce is the MOST garlicky thick sauce I've ever had! I love it! It's so garlicky it sometimes burns the palate a little; so don't eat it for a first or few first dates! Lol 
Overall, this is my favourite Middle eastern restaurant between Aurora & New Market. The quality & quantity you get is good value for your money. They have a large enough seating area approximately 15-20 tables(just recapping my memory). I usually get takeout & haven't dined in for a long time, so I can't say about service anymore. 
I recommend this place to all my friends in the neighbourhood. I prefer to drive to this New Market place for my Middle Eastern food craving just because of good value & taste."}
{"text":"Finding good Lebanese food is more difficult the further you get from the multicultural centre of Toronto.  Newmarket is fortunate to have the Cedar Grill.

I have been here a several times, usually ordering the special or just a nice chicken kabob or shawarma.  The tsitsiki is wonderful, creamy, saturated with garlic and guaranteed to keep everyone at arms length for the rest of the afternoon.

The chicken was tender, nicely charred and flavourful.  All of the other accompaniments were also delicious.  Avoiding too many carbs, I usually bail on most of the rice, but it mixes well with the tsitsiki and give me an excuse to eat all of it!"}
{"text":"really great food! sometimes you have to wait really long for take out, but the food is fresh and delicious, portions are just right.  Customer service makes up for the few times we waited for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a shwarma place that I haven't been so I went after work when my friend told me about the cedar grill.  There was no lineup for take out when I ordered my chicken shwarma so it didn't take long.  The food was really nice and full of taste.  What I really didn't like about the restaurant is how the put menus to cover the glass at the serving counter. I like to see how this type of food is prepared and watch for product quality.

On my second visit I noticed the staff didn't greet me and just stared at my while I walked up to order; uncomfortable experience.  I ordered a chicken shwarma expecting to watch the guys shave it off the rotating cooker, instead I was handed a pre-made order that was part of a larger take out order someone have phoned in.  It was no surprise that it was like warm and not toasted on the outside, however, I was surprised that all I could taste was garlic rather than all the other awesome flavors.

I guess you just have to drive to Toronto for good shwarma still."}
