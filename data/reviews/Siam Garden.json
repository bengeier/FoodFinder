{"text":"Really good food.  They are authentic for sure.  Typical Asian place with minimal wait staff...don't plan on a quick lunch here."}
{"text":"Ate here twice. The food is consistently great. It's a small mom and pop place with one server who does everything.  She's always polite and friendly.  There is usually a wait for your food because its prepared with love well worth it. The price is bang for your bucks. Oh and the Thai coffee and tea is $1.95, can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by its location.  This is a gem of a place.  No pretenses, no frou-frou...just good Thai food.  The family that runs the establishment is courteous, professional, and will go the extra mile for any requests within reason.  It's a hole in the wall, but they keep busy.  The only downside is that they aren't open on the weekends.  They do well enough during the normal work week that they don't have to.  That's saying something."}
{"text":"I went here with my boss and a coworker for lunch one day. We ordered vegetable egg rolls, shrimp fried rice, pad-see-ew, and red curry.   The vegetable egg rolls were fresh and delicious.  The shrimp fried rice (with spicy level 3) was fantastic. I'd come here again for this dish. I could handle the spicyness, but my boss and coworker were sweating. I'd recommend spicy level 2 as bearable for people who aren't accustomed to spicy food.   The pad-see-ew and red curry were good also."}
{"text":"My first time here and I likeThai food. It's a little hole in the wall and I heart this place!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Thai, this is the place. Yes, it is a little hard to find but you will be glad you did. The owner/waitress/cook is a sweet woman from Thailand, who comes to sit and chat with you and make sure everything is what you wanted. The food is amazing, the green curry is the best. Plan a night and make the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food , 8 out of 10 stars (rangun was below average). The service is good, they try really really hard to be there and be polite. Could use another waitress...  The food is where this place shines! Great selection and the curry was exceptionally tasty. Everything tastes fresh and authentic. I will definitely come back for dinner the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm partial to their pineapple chicken fried rice... It reheats nicely, so I always double up when ordering from TakeHome delivery."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here twice already and the food is always delicious. We've had the Panang Curry and the Pad Thai - both taste delicious,  perfect amount of spice. I've had Thai from the best Thai places in NYC and this is up there with them! This is our go-to Thai take-out spot. Love it!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am telling you about this is because I live out of town.  If this was in my hometown I would keep it a secret because it is so good I would want to keep it to myself!  Great authentic Thai.  If you want spicy Thai, this is the place.  Food was fresh and delicious.  I had Tofu Pad Thai that was as good as I have ever tasted.  My wife had the Crab Fried Rice which was also outstanding.  Great food, service and price!  First place I will stop next time in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"We live in the Lake Wylie area but drive to Matthews to Thai Taste which is our favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte. We also go to Thai Orchid as it is near my work place. We have been lamenting the fact that there are no Thai restaurants in our area. Last night on our way home from an out of town visit, I used Yelp to find something. Never heard of Siam Garden but enjoyed the stories every told about the little old lady.  I actually followed the advice of the guy who said \"if you don't mind the long drive, it is worth going.\"  They really are a little out of the way but now I know it is less than 15 min from my house. Yay. We ordered Pad Thai w chicken and Pad Thai w pork. We both loved it. Take out order is indeed huge and enough for 2 people. I got the fresh rolls and loved them. Hubby got the angel fried wings which were ok, a bit dry. When I picked up the food there was what looked like THE little old lady, so I asked her \"have you read the Yelp reviews?\" She looked puzzled and said \"no what are they saying?\" So I told her to read them herself. haha. We will definitely be back to pick up from this restaurant. It is about 7 min from the Harris Teeter at Steele Creek so if you want decent Thai food, you have to at least try them out soon! I will be back to try out their Thom Kha soup and curries."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai in Charlotte.... anywhere for that matter.  The five stars are for the food and charm of the owner.  She is a nice lady and always takes time to chat you up.  Nights and weekends are relatively slow in the dining room, expected based on the location (Corporate Park) but lunch time is always busy.  I am a fairly frequent customer usually stopping by once or twice a week and worth the drive (15 miles).  Thom Kha soup, Red Curry, Noodle Soup, Pad Thai... all of them are consistently delicious.  Overall - If you like Thai food, you need to give Siam Garden a try.  Do not let the empty dining room during the evening and weekend hours spook you away - The food is very good."}
{"text":"For those who are harsh critics, you don't know anything about Thai cuisine.  This restaurant is grade A.  You have both cooks who are from Vietnam and Thailand.  The owner is from Thailand.  The dish you frequently order is Pad Thai.  Try something out of the ordinary and order the Thai salad or the rice noodle soup with vegetables.  Both are staples in Thailand.  If you go to a restaurant and neither of these are on the menu, you're at a restaurant that doesn't know or offer real Thai food.  Those of you who gave this restaurant a thumbs up.  You hit the nail on the head!  Next time try a curry dish with coconut milk served with white rice.  I am from Thailand and if your review of Thai food is based on your experience eating Chinese, stick with what you know."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 6 years about once a week.  Everything on the menu is solid and always fresh.  Service is great. Go Wednesdays or Fridays for good soup."}
{"text":"Always ordered 5 - 8 stars at this place for the last 10 years as I love it spicy. Finally got my wife to go & she ordered a 1 star but only ate about 8 bites.  Just ate her leftovers & now I know why - it was 3.5 - 4 stars. Service was always questionable here but that's BS!  And I say that because I'm almost positive it wasn't a mistake."}
{"text":"This place is close-ish to my office so it is a regular lunch stop.  The food is absolutely fantastic! Everything.  Pad-Thai, wonton soup, red and yellow curry, mint pork all beyond delicious . Even the dessert sticky rice with mango, or roti.... so good!   This mother-daughter team work like crazy!  To my knowledge it's just the two of them both front and back of house.  They are working non-stop, but still take the time to be kind, funny and thoughtful.    The prices are also incredibly reasonable. A sit down lunch for two runs about $15, pretty amazing.    The only drawback is that it is TINY! Maybe seats 30, and is close to the Air Force Base, so around lunch time you're lucky to get a seat!"}
{"text":"Good food!!! People who rated this restaurant less than 4 stars are nitpickers... You look at the place, a hole in the wall, lady serves everyone with the best attitude, family owned, with GREAT FOOD, and cheap price...what the hell more can you expect?????  Lots of Air Force personnel frequenting this place because of reasons mentioned above.....  Lunch special prices, hard to beat....  Spiciness will depend on what you tell them....  So, if you can't take the heat....go eat somewhere else...  Otherwise, you just can go wrong with this place ...  Happy eating, buen provecho, bon appetit !!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried rice during the lunch rush and it didn't come out hot. Wait staff was hurried not always convenient."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way out of Las Vegas. Thought it might be faster that something downtown or near the Strip. No such luck. They were quite busy and only one person taking orders and serving and cleaning up. So the meal took us over an hour. But the food and prices were OK. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.  Don't let my near average rating fool you; it is entirely subjective towards my experiences.  By Las Vegas standards, this is an absolutely outstanding restaurant.  Unfortunately, that puts a fairly dismal outlook on this city.  So, if you're wondering where you were supposed to be getting (Thai) food this entire time, Siam Garden is a good start.  This establishment is located in the same strip-mall as another godsend (USS Fish N Chips).  That means it's in the same shady neighborhood, but like most adventures, some risk is required.  I never thought it was going to be so difficult to find gems like these.  I'd be all for chain-restaurants if they could match the quality AND quantity of Mom & Pop places like these.  A couple do... most don't.  What's so desirable about such places?  It's that feeling that you've been invited into someone's home, and that family is taking personal pride into cooking for you.  Judging by the sincere courteousness of the waitress, and the execution of entrees, Siam Garden definitely falls into that category.  I ordered a chicken red curry; my friend ordered the Pad Thai; and we both had Thai Iced Teas.  We are no strangers to Thai, and these dishes are the standard that any respectable Thai restaurant should pass.  I wouldn't say we were amazed or notably impressed, but we pleasantly surprised mostly in part to our lack of luck elsewhere.  When asked, my friend approved of the Pad Thai.  I've become used to seeing more broth than ingredients, so I was quite happy to have my curry chalk full of fresh ones.  I would have liked to have seen more basil and meat, but what was there was all white meat.  I have yet to see a Thai place screw up sticky rice, and this place was no different.  As for the Thai Iced Teas... forget about it.  They are always worth ordering.  Their spiciness level is also quite curious.  There is the normal 1-5 (mild, medium, hot, thai hot), but then there's the super 6-15.  I can't image the gastronomical napalm they must be wielding.  Since I was already getting a hot (temperature-wise) dish, I opted for a 2, and it verged on perfect -- should have gotten then 3.  My friend did get the 3, and he was quite content.  There's a military discount that was advertised yet we didn't even ask about -- it just showed up on the bill.  Our food arrived fairly quickly, and I'll make another plug for the wonderful customer service by the waitress.  I'm happy places like this can still exist in a city like Las Vegas, and they very much deserve our support."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food(especially the seafood spicy tom yum) and great staff! Prices for lunch are affordable. Great spot for lunch with work friends! Highly recommend if you like Thai food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I have been coming here over 8 years now.  The owner is so sweet and amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding food at very reasonable prices. Our only complaint would be that they seem to be suffering a bit from their success. It's a small place, by my count only nine tables, and when they are in the middle of the lunch time rush, every table is full with a few people waiting. There was only one waitress and she was doing her best, but she was understandably over extended.   Highly recommend this place, just arrive early at lunch time and be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Thailand Garden Thai (also know as Siam Garden and \"that Thai place\") has been around for a few years now. We typically show up for lunch at least once a week (except Tuesdays, because of pineapple soup (yuck!)). The place is clean and well-kept, albeit a bit small. The service is OK, unless it gets busy, then you might die of thirst. The Pud Thai and sweet chicken are excellent, and always spicy."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Nevada.. Must go place .. Very cheap too.."}
{"text":"This is a solid option for Thai food. They have my husband's favorite Pad Thai, and I have never tried a dish here that I didn't like. My personal favorites are the tom yum, pad gra pow, and larb. There are definitely more gourmet options for Thai in Charlotte, but Siam Garden is a great place to get fast, reasonably priced, and good food. We eat here regularly and recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat lunch in the NorthWest side of Vegas and only 3 miles from Nellis AFB. The food is great! Service is great! The Girl that runs the place is very nice and polite. We all know that the part of town is not the greatest and just know that the restaurant is small (only 10 about 10 tables), but it works. Good food, good service, and good price! The yellow curry with chicken is awesome! I have become a regular! Note: she's only open M-F 10:30am to 6:00pm. No weekends."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was very good. I had the chicken red curry medium. Found it through using urban spoon. Price wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent service: The woman was very kind over the phone.  When we went to pick up the food, the woman offered to put less ice in our Thai teas so would could get more.  Food: Not impressed...heat/spice was a replacement for flavor.  The curry had pieces of chicken in it that were all different sizes and seemed prefrozen that way, not fresh."}
{"text":"Very small portion relative to the price.  the food is salty, dry and taste alike! I am a REAL international traveler."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and ordered take out. We recently moved from the Washington DC area where Thai food is plentiful, wonderful and typically inexpensive. So we were surprised at how limited our options in this area were and the price tags for what we ordered from Siam Garden (Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Panang Curry, Spring Rolls and Mango w/Sticky Rice). The price points were at least validated by the very large entree portions we brought home...but our delight over the amount of food didn't really translate to the taste of the food. The Panang was, by far, the best, earning a solid 4 stars. Very tasty. The flavor of the Pad Thai was just ok but there wasn't really much flavor there. The Drunken Noodles were thrown out. Do yourself a favor and avoid them (Pad Kee Mow). Spring rolls were satisfactory. Mango w/sticky rice was well done and a nice way to finish the meal. Overall, on average, everything was just ok. Really, wed rate this place 2.5 stars but yelp doesn't allow the half stars. Makes it hard to justify a return visit, particularly for the ~$14 price per entree.  Keeping our fingers crossed that, as this area continues to expand and develop, we get some additional options to choose from."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Thai restaurant. I've never had curry so I have nothing to compare it to. All I can say is that it was delicious. I hadthe yellow curry medium and it was creamy, spicy, and sweet. Very good. I do recommend this place. The owner was nice and she was able to talk to us a it was a slow day for them. The appetizers we had were the crab Rangoon and the fried sweet potatoes which we had given to the boys but of course tasted them and they were good. I will be going back there."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's not a fancy restaurant but more like homy atmosphere and very reasonable!"}
{"text":"The food was good...definitely not the best Thai I have ever had but def good.  I found the menu a little different and more limited than most Thai restaurants.  They used regular onions with the pad Thai instead of green.  The prik king curry was tasty but would have been better with a bit more sauce.  The location is a bit awkward to get to but you never have to wait in line...seems like a not well known place.  The restaurant was very clean and there seemed to be a lot of regulars that enjoyed the place.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this retaurant and had my lunch many times. Majority of the times ordered Thai red curry with 10 *.. like the spice level. I would say.. Good customer care, spacious restaurant, excellent food quality, fast service, crowded at lunch time (best measure of good taste) and good host.  I will definitely come back to this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place! Everything we have got has been sooo good and we are never disappointed. The waitress is super nice and very respectful. Try the crab fried rice! Soooo delicious :)"}
{"text":"Arrive early if you are going at lunch. Food is made to order so lunch slows down when the place is full. Dinner time has a lot of to go orders. If you are eating in there is plenty of room and fast service. Lunch prices are good but dinner seemed high for the portion size as lunch.  The food can be made with a 0 to 4 heat range. 4 has a lot of men crying like little girls. Now I order 0 with hot sauce on the side. Several different curry types. I will be there for lunch next week."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It's an inexpensive Thai restaurant with great lunch specials. The barbecue beef plate is mmm mmm good. They use some type of house made dressing on the salad, and it is awesome! #TastyTasty Their egg noodles are bomb, too!  If you love spicy food, you can definitely get it here!   The down side is that it's clearly family owned. I came by one day for lunch, and there was a sign stating that the restaurant was closed so they could attend their family reunion. This place is also very small, and has one person who serves as the waitress, host, and cashier. She is very nice, but Siam gets busy. She literally does a light jog from table to table, and it's clear that she could use some assistance.   Overall, it's a place that serves good food, but I started calling in my order and picking it up to avoid the wait and small space."}
{"text":"I came here often when they first opened in late 2009.  It is a small, family owned restaurant.  The food is really good.  My favorites were the pineapple fried rice, seafood tom yum and beef salad though everything else is great.  Service is very good, if you tell them you want it less or more spicy they do it.  Everything is cooked to order and very fresh.  The neighborhood itself is not the best so it's best you come in the day or early eve., but if you order the food take out you should be fine.  The restaurant's close to CSN and the MAX line so it makes for a nice place to catch a break."}
{"text":"I've been to Siam Garden 5-6 times over the last year and am finding the lunch wait nearly impossible to deal with. In the past, I have waited up to 40 minutes for my food TWICE and today, I waited again for 15 minutes for a glass of water (got a pitcher so I could refill my own glass) and left after 30 minutes without being served....anything. The food is mediocre, service is unimpressive (always excuses) but unfortunately, I only get 60 minutes for lunch & I'd like to enjoy my meal rather tha inhale it. I won't go back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Close by the office and I frequent about once every other week.  Anyhow, I'm a big fan of their noodle soup, N67.  I tend to never order the same thing twice from a routine restaurant but I always end up order the spicy 3 chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food at cheap prices!  I go there for lunch and usually get one of the curry dishes with tofu.  They have different levels of spicy you can get, the main selection being between 1-5, but you can go way past that if you want.  I usually get a 2 or 3 and that's spicy enough for me.  Yesterday I tried the garlic vegetables over steamed white rice, and it was really good, and worked as my lunch and dinner.  I got it vegan style with no oyster sauce.  They have good Thai iced tea too.  This place attracts many military men in uniform who come to eat there using a 10% discount offered, which is always nice to look at also.  ;)"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Charlotte... The Owner can be arrogant sometimes, but the food is great... Red and green curries are best... Pad Thai is good too... Dinner takeout portion is big, 2 people can easily share one entree!!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews are telling the truth. This place is a hole in the wall! It's the B-O-M-B!!! My husband and I came here for dinner. We ordered fried squid and house salad for appetizers which were both delicious. For the main course, He ordered the sweet and sour chicken and i ordered the fried tilapia - both came with steamed rice. We didn't realize that servings are pretty huge, so you better come here hungry. Flavors were outstanding. You can choose your level of spice. I choose level 5 and husband chose level 3. Be very careful about your spice levels since they use Thai chili, and for people who never had Thai chili- it is pretty spicy!! You would ask for extra rice to enjoy your meal.  For desert we tried the coconut ice cream and roti with mango. Both were delightful. Coconut ice cream was on point. First time trying roti and i was hooked. It's like a Thai version of crepe.  Overall dinner here was excellent. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte from Hawaii, the land of awesome Asian food! We had an undying urge for sticky rice. You know the kind you can pick up with two fingers and not a grain falls. I have had Thai food on the mainland and know that its a bit different. For example, red thai curry should not have red/green bell peppers and baby corn as filler. Knowing that, we just wanted the rice. So we searched nearby places via Yelp and found this one.   When we called and asked for sticky rice, she mentioned mango rice. I was confused as I have never heard that before. I said no just plain sticky rice, two orders. She said ok, she would need to make it. I found this odd as I figured sticky rice was served with meals being a Thai place and all.  We arrived, rice not quite done (no biggie), and she rang us up. I practically fell over when she said $10 and some change. I did not recall the change because I was hung up on the 10 bucks! What, for rice!!!!! Holy crap!!! I can see $2 per order but DAMN! We let it go. I mean she did make it fresh. So apparently the rice they make normally is mostly for dessert. I'm used to a tapioca type dessert with bananas.    Bottom line, no one should pay that much for rice. Seriously...ouch. I can't comment on the other food items. But really, it's rice. One ingredient."}
{"text":"Best food, cheap prices and the nicest people you could ask for.  The Spicy Eggplant is incredible, as is everything on their menu.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place will always be the place I dream about when I think of Thai food perfection. I've never been to Thailand - but as an American white girl who has eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants in US and in China, I love this place. I wish they weren't so far. Getting ready to move out of Las Vegas and this is a place I want to get to before we leave. That's how good it is.   Please get the chicken satay and a couple of cans of the chrysanthemum tea. The yellow curry is SO GOOD. but I would eat that chicken satay for a meal (multiple orders of course). So sad to be moving out of the area. Should have eaten here more often."}
{"text":"I give this place three stars--the lady was very nice and the order went smoothly, but the food wasn't all that great. The meat pieces were sliced too large and there were not enough meat in some of the orders... Also, on top of that there was A LOT of construction happening in the area that it made it difficult to get into the plaza... For me, I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"So far I've loved everything about this lil family owned \"hole in the wall\", it is very much like eating in a friends kitchen. Warm, welcoming & friendly. I will only go as far as 4 on their spicy level, lol. The Crab fried rice here in phenomenal!! I'm surprised no one has mentioned it...if your not afraid of the area, stop by, just not on a weekend because that is their only downfall (they are not opened) :("}
{"text":"This is my fav spot in North LV. I could eat in there everyday. It is very small and family run business, so don't expect fancy dinning. The girl has a great skill for multitasking, and she still keeps her smiles on!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great food and great service. Went by around 230. Empty, seated and fed right away. Got the pineapple fried rice and pad prk. Great."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food in the Charlotte area. I prefer it to the overpriced Basil Thai uptown. The Pad Thai and Pad See Ewe are fantastic. The Pad Gra Pow is really great and the basic is super fresh. If you are in the area, I definitely recommend that you try this place."}
{"text":"My friend is a fan of Thai food.  But I prefer to try some other Thai place than the one he always goes cos I believe there has to be a better one.  I went to yelp to see how others rate.  Besides, we went out late.  This one showed open till 10:00 pm  I called to make sure they are still open. I found this and I used my GSP to direct us thought it was close to where we live.  Great!  Gosh!  GPS took us to Whitehall Dr near Freedom with a bunch of houses with no restaurants. I called again to find out it was in other side of town.  I then looked for anther place that I used to go & on the way, I also called but that place closed.  Now our way was closed to this Thai restaurant.  We said perhaps we would go to see if they still serve.n 36 This is actually 3607 Whitehall Park Dr that is closed to 485 exit Arrowood Road. We arrived 9:35 pm seeing only two cars there with OPEN sign.  We said let's see if they still served.  The lady said 'yes' and we said Charlotte really not a place like LA or NYC.  We better tried. We ordered Tung Yam all the time and we tried the Pok .. with seafood in small portion for each at $6.00  It came with good portion of seafood, big shrimp, scallop and fish, spicy as we asked for. A dishes of Pai Thai (Fried rice noodle Thai style) with Chicken and A dishes of Red Curry with Beef that comes with Rice.  Both tasted pretty good.  Was it because we were hungry?  Actually, they are much better than the Thai restaurant we went in University.  Totally was slightly over $40 with a soda.  Not sure if we were late and the restaurant was already cleaned for the next day.  It was cleaned...  Once again, the address on top is wrong.  It is 3607 Whitehall Park Dr."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are always looking for a new place to try and after a quick internet search, decided on this place, which was close by.  We've been three times now and see them as one of our favorite places to eat really good Thai food, or just a nice dinner in general.   Each time I've eaten here has been in the evening, dinner hours.  The establishment offers a relaxed atmosphere for dining and because of the location, isn't in a busy area of town. It's a very well decorated and clean dining area, has friendly and personable service, great food, great beer selections, great prices, and really good variety. Pad Wooten might be my favorite dish. They have an excellent assortment of tasty appetizers (I would recommend the deep fried breaded brocolli and cheese) and the mango rice for desert left a lingering crave in my girlfriend's mind to this day. Her son, who is the pickiest eater I've ever met, said that the kid's meal version of shrimp and onion rings were the best he's ever had. I reccomend this place to everyone who is in the mood for Asian food or wants to try something new in general."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! I visit at least once a week! The pad Thai mmmmmmm so yummy! The yellow curry is OMG and Belle the server who I believe is the owner with her mom is awesome!!! She knows what you want before you want it"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get Thai food! This place knows how to correctly spice and season their food; everything I've eaten here has been tasty and full of flavor. (Most other Thai restaurants I've been to just deep fry everything and call it good.)  I highly recommend the Pad Thai and different curry dishes!"}
{"text":"It's one of those gems that you don't find very often...a hole in the wall kind of place where the quality of the food is fantastic. A relatively small place, ok a very small place so you have to arrive early like 11am to get a seat. Standing room only for late lunch. You have to try the fried squid, it's delicious. I ordered the tradition Thai beef noodle soup and it was really good except for one thing: They are serious about the heat with spicy levels. I thought I could handle a 4 out of 5, but their 4 is fire ball hot! I will try a 2 next time. Despite the heat, I thoroughly enjoy my experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas! I will drive 30 minutes from Henderson to come eat here. The food is delicious and fresh and the service is great. The prices are very reasonable too, especially for lunch. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Everything about this place is great.  The food is delicious, service is wonderful, the prices are affordable, and the place is nice and clean.  By far one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"It's a small local restaurant but best thai food in town. I travel 40 min just to pick up Green curry fried rice from here.. That's my favorite. Wish they are open on weekends too."}
{"text":"I love this place for Thai food!  The Pad Thai and Red Curry are my favorite.  Everything I've tried is great.  They'll make it as spicy or mild as you want.  I go 3 or 4 stars, depending on my mood.  Owner always engaged with customers.  Always packed at lunch, which is a good sign."}
{"text":"The food is excellent every time!  The service is by far the worst I've ever had!  When I get a craving for Thai, because it's the only place close enough to work, I call ahead. They ALWAYS say \"15 minutes your order will be ready.\" Remember that's a lie. If your order is ready in under 45 minutes, it Will be wrong and you'll wait another 10 if you're a regular and they know you. If not, you'll wait another 20 to 30. I've walked out twice because I called my order in at 11:45 and stood waiting till after 12:45 and still no food.  That said, I do keep coming back. I just know to call in 30 minutes ahead at least and expect to wait."}
{"text":"went there lunch on thursday lunch around 1pm.  the restaurant is small, have less than 8 tables.  when I get there, two tables were occupied while the rest of tables were waiting to be cleaned.  The waitress came quicky to clean the table and sat us down.  After we sat down, more people come in, looks busy for lunch time for this hole in a wall restaurant.   This is what we ordered for lunch.   Papaya Salad (spicy level 2: perfectly done, fresh and crunchy)  Tom Yum Soup with chicken (spicy level 3: great, but a little bit too spicy for me)  Mint Chicken (spicy level 3: not bad, just prefer more garlic) Red Curry Beef (spicy level 3: not that spicy, I guess I can handle level 4, the sauce taste good)  Sweet Sticky Rice and Mango - perfect one diet coke  for a total of $35.80, I bought a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com for $2, so I paid just about $22 for all the food.  Definitely I will come again when I visit LV"}
{"text":"Had the green curry with pork - curry had good flavor, not enough vegetables in the dish.  Also had the fried shrimp appetizer - six shrimp - good sauce.  Flavorful.  Second time to this establishment.  Solid Thai offerings."}
{"text":"Yellow curry and chicken fried rice were amazing!! Love this place we will definitely be coming back as regulars. Oh and they have amazing lunch specials for only $6.50. Hard to beat that! The service was great and my two year old, who is very picky, couldn't get enough of the spring rolls and fried rice."}
{"text":"Super good. Bella is super awesome. Prices are super reasonable. All around it's just super.  Plus the roast garlic chili sauce is beyond amazing."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided try this place. Off course, it was good that they have late hours - open until 10, because we got there just before 9pm. Charlene had the pad ki mau with beef and I tried something new - red curry fried rice. We both like spicier than locals and I was happy to hear they had a \"thai\" scale in addition to the local hot scale - which only went to 4 but the thai scale went to 8. Char had a 3 on the thai scale, I had 6 and we were both happy. Loved the food! Kristin was very attentive and although the place was empty when we got there, being late Sunday, a total of 8 more people came in after 9. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Siam garden has so much potential. The service is terribly slow. Even when there's only 4 tables occupied it was ridiculously slow. The staff doesn't even try to apologize for the delay. This has happened on more than one occasion. Food is good but not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. I could eat here everyday. great prices and excellent service. Well worth the wait during lunch rush."}
{"text":"HAD to spend one night in Vegas on 6/7/18 while driving west on the I-15 back to CA, and found this place very near where we spent the night in our RV. What a find!!! I have eaten in Thai restaurants for over 40 years, and even taught myself to cook Thai food from scratch at home with authentic ingredients, and this place rates right at the top of my list for flavor, authenticity, and great prices! Can't say enough about the terrific service too--mother was in the kitchen cooking and daughter runs the front and serves, a sweet, friendly young Thai American gal with a great smile. We shared #1-crispy Spring Rolls, #10-Larb (salad w/pork), #23-Pad Thai (w/ shrimp), #48-Spicy Catfish stir fry, and some steamed rice,,,,,,,all was DELICIOUS! We had enough leftover for another meal too, and we have big appetites. Will be back the next time we are in town. (Tip: Be sure to check their hours, they close at 6pm daily.)"}
{"text":"I truly like this place.  I've been here a few times.  Once for a sit down and the other was an order to go.  The place is VERY small and gets cramped pretty quick.  The young lady that works there is awesome as she moves steadily and quickly to get people in and out.  They have the BEST Thai Tea... If they could add boba I would be in heaven."}
{"text":"Really delicious I had the red curry with chicken and summer rolls. There was easily enough food for 3! Giving this a 4 star rating because I don't know what the service is like , I ordered take out."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this restaurant and I knew after lunch there that it was a new favorite.  Have eaten in twice and had take-out twice and the quality has been excellent.  We try to vary the choices so there is a balance between sweet, hot and spicy.  The Siam Honey Chicken is good, kind of a Thai take on General Tso's so good for people trying Thai for the first time.  Had the Green Curry with beef tonight - excellent.  About a 4 on the 1 - 10 hot scale."}
{"text":"Color me happy, Siam Garden is a great little find.  It is way down on Whitehall Park Dr. in a business park.  It's so odd, you think to yourself, there is going to be a Thai restaurant down this road.  Amazing, on the outside it is very nondescript shopping strip mall, but when you walk in the door it is decorated like an ornate Thai restaurant, complete with gold headdresses with signs that read: Do Not Touch Headdress.  The lunch menu is basic, a couple of curries,noodle and rice dishes, Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever been to a Thai restaurant where the menu is different, they are always the same, no matter what city.  Lunch specials offer a spring roll and bowl of soup.  We ordered red curry and pad thai and ordered them hot, spicy, 3 out of 5.  They were perfect.  It was the hottest food I think I have had.  You know the heat that is so hot, you can't wait to get the next bite in your mouth to get the rush again.  But not too hot where all you get is the heat.  Very yummy. I am thinking, I might not want to eat Thai food anywhere else in CLT.  Service was really good too.  Quick and friendly.  I can't wait to go back with a group of people so I can try some more menu items.  I want to have a dinner party celebration and see if they will let me wear the headdress."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to the Valley of Fire, because of the Yelp reviews. It's in a sketchy part of town but most secret places are. We loved the food and the woman who served us was so happy & energetic. It's a tiny place but very popular. Many people arrived within 30 minutes after they opened."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was delicious, some of the best I've ever had! And it was actually spicy. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai in Las Vegas!  Tiny little storefront restaurant owned/run by the nicest ladies gets packed at lunch with Air Force base and CSN crowd.  10% off entire menu for military !!!BONUS!!!  A staple in our office's lunch diet, we're regulars.  We even call it Thai Thursdays!  Their Pad Thai is the best I've ever tasted, my coworker says they make the best Larb, and their soups are delicious, even if you don't have a cold, get some and it will make your day. OMG YUM!  Whenever we order to-go, it is perfectly and individually packaged and boxed ready for pickup within 20 mins.  I don't know how she manages to do that with a full dining room of customers.  She evens carries it out to the car for you even though I tell her she doesn't have to.  We have figured out that by calling in lunch orders by 10:30, we'll beat the mad lunch rush from the base.  When mom & daughter closed up for a week to take a much deserved vacation, our office went through major withdrawal......We love you Siam Garden!!!  See you on Thai Thursday!"}
{"text":"i love this place! food is delicious! authentic! great prices and wonderful service! full of amazing flavors!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place. Good host. But the chicken was not all that fresh. It seemed like its been frozen and microwaved."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food since the return of my trip from Thailand and decided to try this place. I think they need to reconsider the prices of the dishes. Its in the Whitehall Commons Business center, so I'm assuming thats why its overpriced.   About the service, I went in around 8pm on a Monday. The server was not welcoming. Real standoffish. No smile but not rude. Good was done in 10 minutes for takeout.   The food was okay, not bad but not anything I would return to eat or recommend to anyone. It did however have the right amount of spicy. The noodles were a bit over cooked and the chicken was scarce. For 9.94 it wasn't anything to rave about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Siam Garden for an early dinner. We were seated promptly. Our server was courteous. Our food came out fast, which is always a plus. You could tell that everything was fresh, and still steaming hot on the plate. The portion size is healthy; you will get full. I'm grateful that there were plenty of vegetarian options on the menu that were customizable to be made vegan. I had the Pad Kee Mow with vegetables and tofu. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai with tofu. To make my dish vegan, I had them prepare it without fish or oyster sauce, no msg, no egg. The flavor was great because of the fresh basil and tomatoes in the dish.   All in all, a pleasant first visit. The only reason why I gave it a three-star rating is because the price of the food doesn't match the ambiance and level of service. Should be at a lower price point in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have found my \"go-to\" thai restaurant in Las Vegas, woohoo!!!!  If you know me, you'll know that I am a frequent diner/seeker of good thai restaurants that offer authentic, good portioned, inexpensive thai food.  Some people have already discovered the secret behind thai food...and since I'm such a nice person I will share it with you.  Here goes...the best thai food is usually found in small, frugally decorated \"hole in the wall\" restaurants that have grandma-type women cooking in the back.  How do I know this?  Did I mention I eat A LOT of thai food?  Oh and my husband is Thai.  Unfortunately for me, he can't cook.  But now I'm digressing.  moving on...  Siam Garden fulfills this little-known secret and then some.  Not only was the food authentic and delicious, but it was the great service of Belle (the owners' daughter who is the sole waitress) that helped propel my rating to 5 stars.  She was always smiling and very courteous.  Like I said earlier, I have been to many thai restaurants and although the thai culture is known for being kind and always smiling, I don't usually see it in thai restaurant staff.  Go figure!    The way Belle interacted with us and her demeanor just puts you in a good mood.  Never mind that the restaurant lacked a/c and the only thing keeping us cool were a few fans.  Hubby joked that it felt like we were actually eating in Thailand...the food was super spicy (even though we only ordered level 2 out of a possible 15(!!!)... and we were sweatin' like pigs.  Thankfully we had ordered thai ice tea and it came in ginormous glasses with big pieces of ice--refreshing!  That helped the heat a lil...  The entire dinner experience just felt very nostalgic for us.    We will be leaving Las Vegas tomorrow so I'm sad we didn't go here earlier.  But we will definitely be back.  If only they can move to the OC...."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Please do not let the exterior fool you. It may not be in the best area but man is the food great. Having been to Thailand many times, I can atest to this being authentic Thai. Portions sizes are decent and the price is great compared to other Thai places. Service is excellent, although there is only one waitress. Lunch gets very busy as many people on base like to dine here. Try and avoid 12-2pm is you can. Wish they were open later than 6pm, but I guess since it is a mom and pop business they can't be there all day. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great red curry and pad thai. Ordered for takeout, the portions were very generous. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This place, in the 2 visits I've had, has been YUM. The first visit consisted of pork larb, beef pad Thai and chicken panang curry. The larb was served with lettuce, which was different. I prefer cabbage with larb, yet the larb itself was good enough. The pad Thai was freshly prepared with spices being clearly distinguishable. The chicken panang curry was perfect. The second visit, just this afternoon, was worth the 15-20 min drive from home in this unbearable heat. My hubby and I got the beef noodle soup at a level 1 spice, he got the bucket panang curry at a level 2 spice and fried calamari for an app. My husband describes the broth as the best Thai soup he's had in the states... even with that level 1 spice, it was deff spicy! There is not 1 criticism I can link to my soup, it was amazing. We spoke about how it'll be our go to spot for Thai noodle soup come winter time. The calamari was legit and not excessively breaded. This ain't your typical freezer calamari, it was fresh! The chicken panang curry, on this visit lacked a significant depth in the coconut milk used. Oh yah, we also got dessert... an order of banana roti and an order of mango roti. DO IT, you won't be disappointed! Can't beat the hospitable waitress, either! PS, the second time, the chicken panang curry was a lunch special which included a canned soda."}
{"text":"This is not the first Thai restaurant I have been to; but, it is the first to inspire me to learn more about Thai cuisine, and how to make it at home.   The Food is a party in your mouth. It is family owned/operated. Each dish is prepared fresh and made to order as if it was made for a member of the family.   The atmosphere is VERY humble. You will likely have a bit of a wait as this place is VERY popular with the folks at Nellis AFB. If you are not in a hurry, you will be most impressed.  Highly recommend the Panang Curry, Fried Rice, and Pad Thai. Amazing little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I love this place. We wanted soup and the tom yum spice level 2 was amazing the beef fried rice also really good put stickers really good sauce. If your wondering if you should  this place a shot, do it!!!! Its really good. Pinky promise. Mom And dad cook in the back and the daughter is the waitress. How much more home cooked are you looking for"}
{"text":"The food here is crazy good. They're the only one in this city that has jungle curry, as far as i know. The service is great!"}
{"text":"Siam garden is a great place for lunch if you know what to order. The curry is outstanding as is the fried rice. The pad Thai is not as good as other Thai restaurants in town but the Pad Prig is Outstanding. At $8 the lunch menu which includes soup and a spring roll is a good value. I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm craving pad thai because their pad thai is the best hands down (preferably seafood). Though, there have been a couple of times where we have encountered spoiled food. Once, it was the seafood in my pad thai and the second time was my friend's pad si ewe all around. As for the service, the owner is nice at times and other times she can be a bit harsh... as for the other servers, they are very kind. It's quite busy nonetheless --- especially during rush hour. It's worth a shot to try."}
{"text":"Went here last week around 9pm.. Unlike last time when I went was during lunch time. Honesty it's a different vibe at night.. Seem like a good place to settle down and take a breather after a long day at work.. The waitress was tentative. She didn't rush us to order. But I ordered the yellow curry with chicken . It has potatoes and onions. The portion was big enough for 2 ppl or 2 meals if you decided to take it home. Very very tasty.. I ordered mild version but still spicy for me. But I'm the type that can't handle spicy at all. Then I finish my meal with the mango with sticky rice topped with coconut sauce. Now it's sooo good I can't stop thinking about it since. I wonder if they just deliver that. Or how many do I have to order for them to deliver.. That's how good it is., overall I know now to not come during lunch. It is crazy busy during that time and the food doesn't seem as good. But dinner time a good time to be there!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Las Vegas period!! Always fresh always flavorful!!! The waitress's name is Bell...what a sweetheart!!!  Don't let the neighborhood fool you. There's a great restaurant in that little strip mall."}
{"text":"Great Thai food but don't try to eat at noon.  The place gets busy and they get slow.  If you can get there by 1130 then are generally ok for a fairly quick lunch but I hate waiting for a table at noon.  I've never tried the place for dinner."}
{"text":"The best Thai food and service! Family owned business and the place is quite small but the waitress remembers you and knows what you like. I've been going for the past few years and EVERYTIME I walk in she asks if I want spring rolls because she knows they are my fav. The pad Thai is great but don't be afraid to try the spicy eggplant dish as well as the mint chicken lunch special that comes with a soft drink for under $7. The pineapple fried rice is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Reading all these good reviews is really making me wonder if I ate at the same place?? Ok, its one thing if a bad time happens once, but 3 times?? C'mon guys, we are talking about the same place off of Arrowood 485, past Walmart?  Here are my experiences, wrapped into one: The first time I headed there after reading such positive reviews on Yelp back in 2010. I held back writing an ill review because I planned on giving it another try. At the time, I ordered a Red Curry with 4 level spiciness. As always, we were offered the complimentary soup and it was very delish. Light and just enough to make way for the main meal. When the entrees arrived, they were ill-timed. Mine came out waaaaay before my lunch buddy's, which sucked because I always wait to raise my fork. Anyway, it came out a while later and we commenced. The spiciness was right but the saltiness was horrible, just plain horrible. I didnt want to bother because we were crunched of time. I simply squeezed the slice of lemon that was hanging off my glass, and it sort of mellowed it out. I ended up eating only 60% of the curry, because the rice to curry ratio was off.....maybe because of the salt factor? Service was also like the dish----a bit salty :)  Second time I went with my brother who was visiting from college. We decided to try Siam again for lunch and arrived when it was a full house. This time I ordered Pad Thai. When my meal arrived, it was something completely different, no noodles in sight but some kiind of ground meat with some veggies and slices of jalapeno!! I had to wait forever to get the servers attention and when I finally did, he apologized and asked to replace it. Again, I didnt want to kill valuable time so I stuck to whatever it was. It was too spicy for my liking, but whatever. This time too, the service was blah  but I understand with a full house that this is expected.  The 3rd and last time I went with my little sister visiting from TX. I had full faith in my fellow yelpers, so we decided on Siam again. Bad idea!! I ordered the Massamun with no spiciness at all and sweet tea.  I get the right dish this time, but the tea was unsweetened. No problem, Ill just add some on the table.....I did sweeten it, with sugar packets from 'Bojangles'!!! No lie! I mean the packs of sugar bore the trademark name/design of the chicken fast food place!!  How weird, or how creepy? Did someone just walk into a Bojangles and jack all the sugar packs from the tables, Lol, whatever the case is, it still makes me roar with laughter! Anyway, the Mussamun arrives and again, Im doomed with the saltiest plate! Why?? It always happens to me and its not just me, I made my sister try it  and she spit it out in disgust. The nice server apologized and asked to replace it, so I ordered a different item. The Yellow Curry, mild.  That was just very ok, nothing flavorful or memorable. All I tasted was basil and coconut milk.....not good.  All in all, I wont ever find myself there again. Bad service, too bold seasoned food and really no redemption for all these missteps."}
{"text":"This place is rather like Chinese delivery but Thai. That being said it's not a bad place to get delivery and I've been obsessed with them the last two weeks. The Num Tok Beef Salad is probably my favorite thing they do here. I could eat it twice a week every week and be a happy camper for sure!! I've also tried their Pad Si Ewe which to be honest was only okay. Their noodles weren't very good. Everything else about the dish was fine, but the noodles tasted stale/cooked wrong. I've also had the Larb Kai salad which was delicious and their spring rolls which were good. That is as far as I've gotten on their menu because well Beef salad :D. I did order with them through Yelp and that experience was ehhh okay and the delivery cost is insane considering how close I live to Siam Garden. However I ordered from them through Take Home Delivery and the delivery cost was much more affordable and I had a good experience with them. One big bonus of this place is that they will give you the spice level you ask for (truly adhere to the spice level charts). Usually if I go to places and ask for Thai hot or order a traditionally REALLY hot dish they look at me funny and give me a dumbed down version. At Siam Garden if you ask for hot it's pretty much what they give you for Thai hot anywhere else. Overall super happy with this place as a good 'fast food' type Thai place."}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time, and has gone through several owners and changes.  Currently, the food is at its best right now.  I consider it to be 'average, but authentic Bangkok style Thai food.'  Some of the recipes are outstanding, others are not so much.  The waitress is very friendly.  In fact, she took our picture and put it up on the wall with a myriad of other customer pictures.  Since I work very close to this restaurant, I have returned for quick, well priced meals during my lunch hour with coworkers.    One of the traditional Thai dishes that Siam Garden does extremely well compared to other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas is their Tom Kha Kai.  This is a coconut based soup with mushrooms, chicken, lime juice, and galanga root.  Watch out for the galanga root if you are not used to it.  The broth is much creamier than most places, and with a little extra lime juice on the side it can make you pucker!  I was very impressed with this dish at Siam Garden.  I have had quite a few dishes here.  The curry is ok, but nothing to rave about.  The Rad Na is average, and I won't be ordering it again.  The fried rice is ok, but sometimes a bit too greasy for Thai fried rice.  My favorite dish here is the pad see ew.  The noodles in this dish, and the flavors of the sauce make it pretty good, along with fresh Chinese broccoli.    One thing that they don't do well here is pork.  The pork tends to be very dry and chewy.  I always order chicken here over the pork.  Another annoying thing about this place is how they interpret the \"spice level\".  I like spicy Thai food, but there is no sense in ordering anything above a \"mild\" because every dish seems to be prepared with a \"very hot\" rating.  And to think that their sign says that you can try their food with even hotter levels. One thing is for sure, for better or for worse this is the hottest Thai restaurant I have ever been to.  If you live or work in the area, give this place a try.  I wouldn't drive more than 10 minutes to get there, but considering the lack of places to eat in this neighborhood, it is pretty decent authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Siam garden is near my work area and I've been coming for years. It hits the spot, you get a good portion of food and it tastes pretty good. Lunch time is jam packed, so that says a lot. If you like spice, Siam has it. The only thing I will say is that, most times I order a level 2 spice and it's really hit or miss. Some days it tastes like I got a level 4/5, some days it's a 2 and others a 1. I did notice if I add modifications to my meal, it's exactly the spice that I ordered (i.e. no peanuts, extra scallions for pad thai or no basil or bamboo shoots for the curry). It's perfect. So maybe if they get multiple orders of the same thing, it all gets cooked together. Needless to say, I will revisit as it's convenient and pretty good. Love the red curry!!"}
{"text":"Small location but great and flavorful food. I would have given them 5 stars but the wait and service needs improvement."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. The owner, Lam Pang is such a sweet lady. Lunch is usually very busy between 12p-1p."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The food is always made to perfection. The owner learns your favorites and makes them to your liking every time. She works tirelessly and has an amazing heart for people. You feel loved and filled up every time you come in. The food is authentic and made with very fresh ingredients, you can tell everything is prepared specifically and meticulously. Some of my favorites are the birds nest appetizer, fried rice (any selection), yellow curry and the chef's specials. Oh and spicy really means spicy here, if you are spice lover like me, you will be right at home. If you don't they can make sure all the fire is put out for you. If you haven't been, it is a must you try it ASAP!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while, for lunch and dinner but mostly lunch. Don't know about some of these other reviews, but the Pad Thai is, for me, arguably the best in Charlotte that I've had. Soups and curries are equally good, but to be honest I usually don't stray too far from the Pad Thai. Really nice, friendly wait staff. Owner lady is affectionately whacky. Obviously not for everybody; be expecting a wait if you go during the lunch rush but otherwise totally worth a try."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. I've been here several times (my office is around the corner) and have never been disappointed. If you're looking for a quick tasty lunch, this is the place. My only gripe is that checkout takes a while during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Love their food.  It is the best in Charlotte that I have found.   I have never had a problem with the service.   The atmosphere is kind of blah, but I don't go there for the atmosphere.    Owner, very nice and remembers you if you are a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Siam Garden - I have seen your coupons in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay quarterly for years.  I have seen you when traffic forces me to take a backroad detour to work.  I never met you until today.  Siam Garden appears to be a very clean restaurant.  A 98 sanitation grade and ServSafe certification are displayed up entering.  The tables are decorated nicely with plates, bowls and napkins.  What is a little odd that despite how pristine it is, boxes are visible and the counter, complete with soda cans and 5 hour energy drinks, could pass for a market in Manhattan.  This is mostly for the University of Phoenix offline students of course since the campus is close.  I'm no expert on Thai food for sure.  I've had pad thai a few times, but I don't know what authentic pad thai is.  I have two friends who've lived in Thailand, so I'll ask them.  However, I know what tastes good, and the pad thai here tastes better than the others I've had.  Our service was prompt and quick, but it was a late 8pm dinner so there was only one other table of 4 guys originally from India. My wife had the tofu fried rice and I tried it too - it was very good.  Tofu is difficult to cook so that's it not mushy, but they did.  Sodas were served in cans at $3 a pop which is a little high.  However, with the coupon, which added 18% gratuity as stated, we still had a reasonably priced meal.  For the days we want something other than Chinese food, we will hit this place up.  Though there isn't much around it, it's easy to get to from Steele Creek, Fort Mill, and is right off of 485 at exit 3, making it convenient to even more people."}
{"text":"This place is my happy get-away. I frequently come in for lunch and have been for dinner a few times.  The sweet Jasmine tea is to die for, and the complmentry bowl of soup is always good (i am not a soup person).  I rarely sway from the pad thai- tofu, 3-4 stars. AMAZING. The tofu is always perfectly cooked, a litttle crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  For Kids, the thai spaghetti is a perfect! A basil heavy red sauce over noodles. As in the the previous reviews, i have to agree the the service is weakest point of this otherwise perfect restaraunt. I can deal with bad service if the food is so good. I have found that Friday lunch is awful. I waited an hour to get my food one Friday. The best days are Mon-Wed. I also agree about the owner. Like in the show 'Cheers' every time i walk in and she greets me by name, She gives me a hug, and asks how i am doing. Although the sign says do not touch the headress...  Update. I've given Siam the rightful star it deserves. I've been in several times and the service had improved. Seems fair enough."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with this restaurant. Just moved here about 2 weeks ago and had to find a new Thai restaurant. We ordered the chicken fried rice, spicy catfish w/ steamed rice and all of it was delicious. The staff was very polite, definitely gotta come back"}
{"text":"I can't give them a good review I ordered food from here twice and the first time my clear noodles was sour, now if it's lime juice which shouldn't be in the dish in the first I would be upset but I'm pretty sure it was spoiled so j didn't eat that dish, the second time I ordered from there bc I live right next door to the place and it's closes Thai food. I order a bunch of food for a few people since we always eat family style. And again taking home the food the flavor was all off. The wings was fried in old oil and probably refried several times bc it was dry and black. Idk how they would even allow for that to get packed to be sent off for anyone to eat. And the most disgusting part of it is the peanut sauce that goes with summer rolls had mold in it, I dipped the roll in it and noticed the mold right as I was taking a bite of the roll. I never been so infuriated with a restaurant in my life and I have been in the business for 10 years! It's an insult to all restauranteurs to serve shit like that."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place one last try. Alas, I will not go back. Ever. The owner's attitude was worse than ever. My friend and I were so nice to her and she was just cold and rude. She acted like we were bothering her. I keep reading reviews about her being so nice. She *used* to be nice years ago. Now she can't even crack a smile and it honestly looks like she *hates* being there. I'm sorry you hate your job so much but it's not your customers' fault!   I ordered my usual chicken gang massaman 4 star spicy level. I could drink that sauce it's SO DARN GOOD. The chicken is almost always overcooked, though. When I placed my order I politely asked the server to ask the cook to not overcook my chicken. Sure enough, it was overcooked. I should have sent it back but I didn't. That's no one's fault by my own but to be honest I was afraid the owner would get mad at me. :-(   The straw that broke the camel's back yesterday was the ever so inefficient way of paying the check. I have no idea why the owner can't follow the same systems other restaurants do. I have always been annoyed by this whenever I've gone. Instead of giving you a check with what you ordered, the price of each item, the tax and the total, they just write down what you ordered. That's it. It's not even written out; it's the number such as L18.  You have to stand in line and the owner rings you up. So if you have three people on one check, you all have to stand in line. This is terribly inefficient at lunch. There will be 10 people standing in line and people will be waiting to be seated. It's all one big mess.   I fear that the servers do not get their tips. It's a little hard to explain why I feel that way but the owner has complete control over the checks and the money and it's just little things I've observed here and there that lead me to think that.  I make it a point to leave cash on the table for a tip so that the server can take it as opposed to leaving the tip on my credit card when I pay my bill. I have a strong feeling that the owner pockets most of the tips left on credit cards. When I've put tips on credit cards in the past, I see her placing a little bit of money in the tip jar but it's not what's actually given as a tip. I VERY much hope I'm wrong about this. Someone please prove me wrong.  I can only imagine what a horrible place it is to work because the wait staff is terribly overworked and I doubt she treats them better than she does her customers!   If I could rate the soup, spring roll and gang massaman sauce by themselves I'd give them five stars. The service gets zero stars. I'd give the chicken three stars and Pad Thai two stars."}
{"text":"Hands down, GREAT THAI FOOD!  Definitely coming back on our next trip to Vegas! The Thai tea was perfect and was less than $2! I like that you can choose the level of spicy on every dish and that level 1 is extremely mild... I'm a baby when it comes to spicy! Lol, but I love the flavors of Thai food! If you can imagine eating at your Thai grandmother's home, this is the vibe you would get at this small, but quaint place. The service is excellent and the food came out piping hot! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"A great little spot. The server is super sweet. We have eaten here twice now and pleased both times.   Customers really are at the heart of this place. Their walls are covered with photos of the customers.   Today we were the only customers when we came in. We were talking amongst ourselves that we were a bit chilly. The next time the server came, she asked if we were cold and she turned down the ac for us!   The food comes out quickly and is very yummy. Not to mention their prices are super low.   With a salad order and two entrees my boy friend and I walk out completely stuffed and a bill of just under $25.    They have a very wide spice scale Regular 1-5 Extra 6-15 Plus extra spice on the side.   I love spicy food so even with a 15, I still add more spice.   Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas! ALWAYS PACKED!! Hole in the wall & great service! I've tried pad Thai, mint chicken, spring rolls, curries and beef salad-all are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"The bf and I went here during what we call \"the dead zone\" time of day when most the best restaurants in Charlotte are closed in between lunch and dinner. I had to have some Thai and I realllly wanted Basil but this was literally the only Thai restaurant in our vicinity open at 3:30 on a weekday. When we got there we were the only customers. Little old lady guides us to a table, sets down two menus and walks away. Ooooo...kay.  She didn't come back to get drink orders until we were ready to order our food. We ordered crab rangoon as a starter (it was really good and made with real crab) I ordered the shrimp pad thai, extra hot. It was great! The bf ordered honey chicken...it tasted ok. But then the unthinkable happened - he discovered a little DEAD FLY in the chicken. He told the server, she apologized and went to throw it away. I was grossed out--but my pad thai was delicious I kept right on eating, but not without first scrutinizing every bite that went in my mouth. All good. The lady brought him out a fresh new plate of chicken about 5 minutes later.  All in all, minus the dead fly it was ok. The authentic Thai decor was really beautiful to look at, but I think I will wait until Basil is open before going here again."}
{"text":"I love Thai food!!!!  This place is awesome. My father met the owner a few years ago at CVS and she invited us for dinner there. I have loved it ever since!!!! Great place to eat. Clean and friendly staff!!!!"}
{"text":"The Service has been pretty good every time I have eaten here!  You may find someone new who knows less about the Menu than you, even when it is your first time here... In a place like this that does NOT bother me!  The Servers are plenty friendly!  My Food Order has always been accurate and Hot too!    The Food is good or Better than good for Thai so in my way of thinking better than almost all Chinese and some Vietnamese!  Thai Basil with minced Chicken, Red Curry and Pad Thai are some of the Dishes I have Eaten and these I have eaten twice EACH or more here!  Never been here at Night, only for Lunch!  POPROCK LOVE Brought me to this place my first time!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai restaurant and maybe even the worst restaurant I have ever been to. This is not an exaggeration. Not only was the food inedible, but the hostess who is also the owner was really rude and refused to serve us. As soon as we sat down, she asked \"What you want?\" My friend and I were not ready to order and asked for a few minutes. She rolled her eyes at us and left. She never came back and one of the girls working in the kitchen had to come out to help us with our orders. We ordered 3 dishes: the Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, and the Chicken Larb. The Pad Thai was soooooo overly sweet with no peanut flavor at all and tasted nothing like Pad Thais I've had at other Thai restaurants. I couldn't even eat it at all and had to ask for extra peanut sauce. Even after adjusting for the nasty taste of the Pad Thai, the food was still inedible. My friend said his Massaman Curry was the worst he had ever had. The Chicken Larb was disgusting. Not only was the chicken overcooked but tasted like someone had simply just squeezed a dozen limes and put a ***load of cilantro onto it. That was all I could taste. Nevertheless, this was one of the worst eating out experiences I've had in my life. We went to the restaurant over 2 months ago, and I still recall all the details of the horrible service and disgusting food because it was just that terrible.  One Additional Note: The manager/owner/hostess was really nice to a couple of people who came in and was hugging them and talking to them nonstop. I am not sure how she formed these alliances, but the entire time she was sitting with her regulars, no one came over to take our orders. She was just one table behind us and could clearly see we had not been served."}
{"text":"Small quaint place great food. I usually get the Tom yum soup but I opted for the yellow curry with chicken. Super tasty! I feel like there are only two people here, the cook and the waitress. The waitress takes care of EVERYTHING and EVERYBODY! She is so sweet and courteous, other than the simple grandma made this flavor of the food the service is also a pleasure to deal with!"}
{"text":"Super nice family and they really try hard to get your order to your specifications, but I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor (other than heat level)."}
{"text":"Siam has amazing Thai food. Period. The atmosphere is just so-so, and at lunch time, the service can be extremely slow because they are packed. That said, the lunch specials offer great prices and good sized portions of amazing food.   They will customize any dish for you by adding vegetables or taking things away. They can also legitimately make it super hot, which a lot of places won't do these days. I've tried multiple things on the menu, and everything is cooked to perfection, you can almost feel the love!  We usually get it to go, but regardless, you aren't going to be hungry, and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Pretty much only positives to say about this place. Our food was fantastic, and I do have a pretty good idea what Thai food should be like, having grown up in Portland, OR. If you like eggplant, get the eggplant stir fry. Oh man, delicious. Our server was very sincere and helpful. The decor is simple and a bit chintzy, but for a $7 meal, one can't really complain. Their hours are kind of disappointing though, being closed at like 19:30, plus all day Saturday and Sunday. Clearly a lunch hour and after-work crowd. Also, the neighborhood isn't great, though I never felt uncomfortable with my surroundings."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  We saw a coupon and thought we would try it out for dinner.  It was absolutely awesome--the best in town.  If you are in a hurry don't bother, because the owner is the only one who works the dinner shift but she is extremely friendly and we greatly enjoyed ourselves.  Fair pricing for the quality.  Totally try it out because I don't want this place to ever go away."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for the past couple of yrs. The food is pretty good but, during lunch it's very very slow. I work about 5 minutes away and always call my order in. Normally, I'm told it'll be about 25-30 mins before the food is ready. Fine. However, there have been several times that when I got there after 30 minutes, I've still had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes for the food. Very inconvenient and defeats the purpose of calling in. I've always been cordial with the owners and other wait staff even after these ridiculous waits. Today, I mentioned to one of the workers there that I had a problem with my additional 20 minute wait time. The owner overheard and went into the register and slammed a $10 bill into my hand and got nasty with me when I was NOT nasty or rude with either of them. She kept telling me \"bye..bye\". I was not even asking for a refund just making a suggestion to give more accurate food pick up times. I did not appreciate the rudeness. I see a few other reviewers have encountered rudeness as well. Loyal customers should not be treated in this manner...NO customer should. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Located amidst the White Hall Business centers, I could sense this could be one of the most crowded restaurants for lunch. We decided to try this for dinner on a Friday night. Stepping inside you get a feel of the ambience being in the middle between a well decorated and a ruined one. There were interesting painting around the wall but there were really weird objects you shouldn't find at a restaurant - an old Thai Beer bottle on the self with a very thick coat of dust, boxes/packaging items stacked up, and lot other less significant objects. Made me wonder if the restaurant is part car garage/store room.   We ordered food and waited for around 20-30mins... nah, food didn't turn up, waited for another 10 or more minutes until we saw the food plates. In fact there were only less than 12 to 15 people in the whole restaurant. Everyone seemed to be sitting impatiently and watching faces and no one was eating. We came in very hungry but by the time food came, we forgot all our hunger.   My friend and me ordered Stir fry dishes which was a big let down - totally bland tasting dish, no sauce or spicy flavors other than a tonne of greasy oil! Our friends got curry dishes which seemed way better!   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you work on one of the office buildings on the White Hall Business Drive. The food comes late, not the best tasting food and you could get better looking ambiances else where!"}
{"text":"Some of the best curry I've had in a while. Very friendly staff and good customer service. The portions are big and I love that!"}
{"text":"Just found this place, food was great. The curry had an excellent flavor, and it was nice to get spring rolls where you could actually taste the filling and not receive an overload of fried wrapper. Dessert options were limited, but we don't often get dessert anyway. The lady running the restaurant was very nice, definitely a family ran business. Wife and I were happy to find a decent Thai restaurant in Steele Creek."}
{"text":"I ended up here because it seemed to be the highest rated restaurant in the area.   I walked in and was surprised at how packed it was, most of the people dining were military and ordering the lunch special.   The girl working was running around frantically because she had too many duties. She was the waitress, hostess, food runner, and buser. She needs some help during the lunch rush.   I ordered the yellow curry which is usually a safe bet at any Thai restaurant. It came out piping out. Not very pleasant when you can't even enjoy your food because it's too hot to eat. The curry tasted pretty average, chicken was gummy which is pretty standard for a hole in the whole Thai restaurant, vegetables tasted fresh. One thing I did appreciate was the spice level scale being accurate. I ordered the level 2 which I was told was medium spice level. Usually when I ask for medium I get mild but the spice level of my curry was spot on.   Three stars for my waitress maintaining composure and friendliness while having to do everything except for cook."}
{"text":"This place rocks.   Lunch gets a bit crowded, but after 1:30pm, you will have no issue finding a table."}
{"text":"It's been a year but this place is still amazing and my favorite lunch spot for good thai food. Go with the super hot levels if your feeling brave and want an endorphin rush!!  I just ordered the pad Thai level 7 so I will post on how that turns out for me!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when I was told the food was great and got a little worried from the looks of the place on the outside. It was packed at lunch but a table cleared up quickly and the very friendly server was right on point. The food was DELICIOUS!!! I had potstickers and basil chow mein. Can't wait to go back. Surely going to be one of my regular places when I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"there lunch special are just 6.50.. like wow ! you get so much and multiple options . the meat is great quality . you cant beat this deal"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Thai food in the Charlotte area. Every time I'm back in the area I always take a trip to Siam garden. I've even brought picky eaters there and they're always super happy with the tasty dishes."}
{"text":"I always get their chicken pad thai and they never disappoint! If you enjoy authentic thai food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and is what brings me back to this restaurant. What is not so excellent at this restaurant is the service. A few colleagues and I like to venture here on our lunch break, but the ordeal takes a while.   Being seated is rarely an issue, even when the dining area is packed at noon. Once seated, however, it may be ten minutes or more before drink orders are taken-- the good thing is by then I have likely made a decision about what dish to order. At lunch, guests receive a complimentary soup prior to their order. The ginger soup is my ultimate favorite, though the Miso is a close runner up. The soup is a great way to tie you over (if you're starving like I am by lunchtime) until the dish is served. The time from order to place-mat ranges, but the average is 20 minutes or so.   The red curry is to die for!!! I order the red curry with chicken over brown rice-- at a level 2. **Levels: Dishes such as the curry, the waitress will ask you which level you want. This refers to the level of spicy you enjoy. The spice levels are very liberal; beware the higher numbers (4 is HOT. But if it is your dig, try level 9 like one colleague I know. His brow is literally sweating!) **  Another great dish is the cashew chicken (loaded with veggies). This dish is nice simply because of the veggies. Big blocks of broccoli, , red and yellow bell peppers, and onion scatter the plate. This is a nice change from the curry (no matter how much I love it), as the curry only offers a few red bell peppers.  The waitresses are polite, but not very personable, and the owner is always bustling around keeping careful watch over her business. She is certainly nice enough, but we have all agreed that sometimes her mood swings come across to us.   Definitely check out the interesting decor; there is ample of it for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST thai food in the area (and we have tried several other places that are closer, and we haven't found one yet).   We have never eaten in, as we always take it to go. I love their yellow curry here, and my husband's favorite is the pad prik king. We both get ours the second to highest level for spice, and it never disappoints. We have switched up several of their starters, and we have always enjoyed them as well. While the two above are our favorites, we do switch it up and have tried several other dishes and are always very happy with our choices. The employees are always super friendly.   We have been to Thailand, and this food is by far the closest to authentic that we have had.. Again, I wish it was just closer!!! A definite must try for a Thai food lover!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch when travelling through Las Vegas! Outside looks are deceiving. Excellent food and service. Prices very reasonable. I will be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Pad thai is great. HUGE portions but ordered shrimp & chicken - only got 3 shrimp :-( Will return"}
{"text":"I got the vegetable Thai red curry to go. when I walked into this restaurant it was packed I like seeing that  while waiting in line at the register to get my pick up the woman who worked there knew all her customers names and was pretty much friends with everyone it was really nice . I loved the red curry it was a little spicy but I didn't mind. It had lots of flavor and a bunch of vegetables. I only gave 4 stars because I need to try more on the menu first . I will deff order from here again and its close to my house"}
{"text":"Went here because Lotus of Siam was closed. My parents are regulars here, so I decided to try it. I had the red pork curry and it is easily comparable to Lotus of Siam's curry. It is much cheaper than Lotus of Siam and I recommend anyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Picked up to-go for lunch the other day because I still haven't mastered that \"eat by myself in a restaurant\" thing.  I got Pad Thai with chicken and the Tom Kha with chicken. The Tom Kha was good but it was definitely thicker then I expected. I am used to a more brothy/coconut milk consistency and this was thick, almost creamy. It was still good. The Pad Thai is the reasoning for the 3 stars; It just wasn't very good. I didn't eat hardly any of it and tried to eat more later and couldn't.   The place was packed at lunch so I will definitely go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if I could. Service...the worst. Food...yuk. Nice place but horrible restaurant. My advice...STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"If you're ever doing take out, order the pad thai without the onions and peanuts & you'll get so much more for your money. I'm a regular customer and the owner is a sweet older lady. I normally order the pad thai spicy(level 5) and the Siam hot wings with the sauce on the side. It's delicious! Five stars for the Pad thai but 3 stars for the service if you dine in.(it can be a little slow)"}
{"text":"I've been to almost every Thai restaurant in Charlotte and this is definitely the best. The lunch deal is great, you get a lot of food for a reasonable price. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"I regularly eat here when I get a craving for pad thai or pineapple fried rice. Sushi is good. I really love their fresh rolls! I wish they delivered!!"}
{"text":"This place was fine...not great, but not terrible. The staff is lovely, and I like the cool Thai items (crowns and art and religious-looking stuff) that adorn the walls and hang in display cases...but the food is just ok. Thai is in my top 3 kinds of food, so I kind of expect a lot.  I've been twice now, but both times have kind of let me down. I've asked for \"5 star spicy\" both times, and I get back something pretty insipid. The food is fine, just not so spicy, and not like the party in my mouth I expect from Thai restaurants..."}
{"text":"Thai Restaurant, Siam Garden in North Las Vegas. A great family run restaurant that had outstanding food and superb service for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great north of Vegas grub. Solid curry dishes."}
{"text":"Homestyle. That term probably best describes this tiny hole-in the-wall in Northtown. I came in with a party of 5 just after noon on a Friday for lunch with some work friends. They had been here before, I had not. Honestly I was leaning toward a basket of tater tots from the Juke Joint up the street but was convinced to come along and givie it a try. Soooo glad I did. This one cook/one waitress operation is suprisingly good and an excellent value. I had a BBQ beef lunch special and it was delicious and satisfying. Plenty of food but not so much that I'd be worthless after lunch at work. Others in our party had Pad Thai, some noodle dishes, and other assorted yummies. Everyone really enjoyed the food and extremely friendly service from our kind waitress.  One thing to remember....thier spice level system is pretty ridiculous... a \"4\" was good and spicy, I would imagine that anything higher than 5 will probably rip your face off.  Brave the sketchy hood and come give this place a shot. Good food at a good value and as a plus  you'll be supporting some nice people in thier small local establishment."}
{"text":"had good timing when i went with a friend and there was no wait to get a table. the area is sketchy, but the food was cheap and very delish. i will definitely go back!  (my smartphone's map app took me into the trailer park. don't do it. this place is on the main road.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai in Charlotte.  I have had the red curry and the (darn i cant spell it) Massuman curry here along with the chicken satay.  The chicken satay appetizer is served with a thick peanutty sauce and a great side of cucumber and onion mixed with a sweet sauce.  To die for!   The red curry is the best I have ever had in my life.  (Um ok I have never been to Thailand....just getting that out there.)  It comes with a side of rice.  The Massuman curry is like other places (like Monsoon) but a touch better because the sauce is thicker.  The owner says she uses a 90/10 split coconut milk to water ratio instead of the usual 50/50.    It is a TAD pricey, you can easily spend 16 bucks for lunch and have just enough food but it is worth it.    I didnt give it five stars because Jesus Mary and Joseph it is so far away!  And the decor of the place is a little McDonalds-y with Thai touches.  But the food and service are great!  Love you Siam Garden!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear up front that this restaurant's food deserves the 5-stars that so many give it. It's great. But restaurants aren't just about food.    Siam Garden is a logistical nightmare. A front of house that is only about 400 square feet coupled with far too many 4- topper tables seating parties of two translates into a very inefficient setup. Plus, there's only one employee in the front of house so she's serving as hostess, waitress, and cashier at the same time.   I arrived on a Tuesday for lunch at 11:50am. I was meeting two friends over our lunch hour. After a 20 minute wait, we were seated. Our drinks came within another 10 minutes and we placed our orders. And then we waited. At 12:45, with still no food, my friends asked to change their orders to \"to go.\"  At 12:55, they had to leave without food. The food came out at 1:05pm, 75 minutes after arrival. I paid for all the food and left the restaurant at 1:15pm to deliver the food to my friends' places of employment, a total of 85 minutes from the time I arrived. From the looks of the crowd, this was average for that lunch service. There were a lot of frustrated people.   Why 2-stars?  Mainly because Siam Garden's hours are really lunch-only. If you are a lunch-only restaurant and it takes someone 80 minutes to get in and out, that's not impressive. Is the food good?  Yes, undoubtedly, but it makes little difference if the dining experience takes an hour and a half when you have only (ahem) a lunch hour."}
{"text":"The first time I tried the place, I ordered the spicy eggplant with tofu, one of my favorite Thai dishes. The lady was SO friendly, she makes the experience worthwhile. But when i tasted the food, there was no flavor at all. It was very disappointing. I decided to give them another try so I ordered the phad Thai which is a more simpler and popular dish, hoping that it would be better. It was a little better, but the chicken had no flavor at all. The noodles had good flavor, however. My friend really enjoyed her Thai tea but they all said the same about the chicken, it really had no flavor. This place isn't bad, but it's not anything special."}
{"text":"Definitely another place that defines hole-in-the-wall. I didn't even know there were any Asian joints in this area but apparently there is. I was introduced to this place by my friends because we needed a place to hit for lunch while at CSN Cheyenne campus. Yes this area is really sketchy, but don't let that stop you from coming here. I immediately looked for the lunch specials ($6.50 + 10% student discount- what a deal!) I ordered the BBQ chicken in hopes of it being somewhat like Thai BBQ's and unfortunately it was not. I guess nobody can duclicate their famous BBQ. This was just okay and fortunately we ordered other things like Pad Thai and chicken satay. Pad Thai was really good, one of the better ones I've tried. I was at first surprised to see the color of the noodles to be color-less. That was weird for me because they usually had a orange/redish color, but our asian friend immediately corrected me and said they don't use food coloring- good to know! Other than the color issue it was really tasty. The chicken satay was good too and came with a peanut sauce. The service was standard and probably a step up from most Asian restaurants. The decor was really off, but I guess that's what makes it hole-in-the-wall. All in all, great experience. I will definitely be paying them a visit before the semester is over!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Thai food for the area. Fresh ingredients and lots of vegetables.  Spice levels reach high be careful of even level 5. The Thai lady who runs it is very nice. Make sure you lock car doors !"}
{"text":"Best thai place in charlotte!!!!! Service can be slow at times but the owner is the sweetest lady! There is nothing else that can match it!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my experience here. The food was fresh and tasteful. I think the food here might be the closest to authentic than any other restaurants that serves Thai food."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by friends and I immediately fell in love. I moved to Vegas recently and have been craving authentic thai cuisine. I'm so happy to have found this place!  The inside is clean and simple. Been here often and at different times and there is no wait time for seating. Wait time for food is about 10-15 minutes. They even deliver for FREE!   Now to the good part. The food is EXCELLENT. Absolutely delicious. Exactly the taste that I'm used to. The chicken larb is so good. Very flavorful. A few times I've asked for them to not add as much fish sauce as it was a little too salty. The fried rice is also good. They serve decent size portions. You can easily share between two people. The pad thai is also good. One of my favorites that I haven't found at any other thai restaurant is the beef jerky with sticky rice. Seriously, try this!  The service is AWESOME. We are usually waited on by a lovely lady named Belle. She is super sweet, and super friendly.   EAT HERE!:D"}
{"text":"My husband actually discovered this hole in the wall and he's been here with his work buddies more often than not.  He tried taking me a couple of times but they were closed the first time (closed on Friday nights through the weekend).  I can't remember what happened the other time.  But obviously we eventually found our way there.  Onto what you came here for.  This place is small.  I mean really really really...really small.  So, if you're gonna hit them up for lunch you better get here just before 11.  After 1130 you can probably count on waiting for a seat or few to open up, especially if you're with a group.    The lunch specials are a good deal.  You get a drink with your lunch sized meal.  The kids had the bbq pork (marinated pork chop sliced on the bone), I had the Pad Prick (er something like that) spice level 3 with tofu.  This was a good spice level for me.  I like a kick to my food but now so hot that I am constantly drinking more than eating.  The hubster had their curry.  That's all he's had and he likes them all with a spice level 5.  The waitress is very friendly and helpful.  Good eats for cheap and for my military peeps you get a discount."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that such place exists on this side of town.  This whole time I was driving across town to get my fix on delish Thai food, I'm sort of mad I didn't discover it sooner.  I had Pad Thai and Red Curry and though the curry was a but spicier than anticipated, it was so delicious I still ate it :)!  I'm definitely going to visit this place on a regular basis; it's close to home, it's delicious, and service was delightful!"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero if I could. Reading the 1 star reviews here completely match up to my experience: lousy food, grunting waitress/owner, vegetables undercooked, shrimp overcooked, long wait for water, etc. but my food came out almost too fast. I had just gotten my appetizer, had a couple bites, and there was my entree! It was like she wanted to get rid of me as quick as possible!   I was extremely nice to her, but that made no difference. Meanwhile, she's chatting it up with the other few folks in the restaurant. It seems that if you're a regular, you get great service and good food (I guess...), but if you're a first-timer you get treated like dirt. I don't know how they get repeat customers, as I will surely never return, and will spread the word as much as I can.  This was the worst dining experience I can recall ever having!"}
{"text":"I found this place back in 2008 when I worked in the area. Since then this has been my benchmark for Thai food. Staff is super friendly. The family run location will always have a place in my heart. I use to make a 1-3 time a week lunch trip here. When back in Vegas I make it a must stop.  Best part about this place is how family oriented the staff is. They shut down every year to travel back to Thailand to visit family and gather local spices. This is key to their flavors!! Spent so much time at this place my picture is on the wall, and I would get Christmas gifts!  Hands down the best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten at. Better than Restaurants in Japan, San Francisco, DC, LA, San Diego, or Orlando."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! This is where I go for a Thai every time! Ps if you like spicy they will actually make it spicy!"}
{"text":"Thai is one of my favorite international cuisines. Siam garden offers a delightful authentic menu of Thai stir fry and curry classics, I frequent this place weekly and have gotten to know the menu well. I find nothing to complain about and leave happy each time. A word of caution the food can be very spicy so watch your spice levels.  The curries are done well and perfectly creamy; this place is ideally located in a corporate park so expect heavy traffic during lunch time as it is a favorite among working professionals."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Came based on a recommendation from a co-worker. Had the lunch chicken pad Thai, which was delicious. The service, however, left a lot to be desired.  We waited over 10 minutes after we were seated for anyone to take our order. It took a notable amount of time for our orders (two fried rice; one pad Thai) to come. I noted that another table, that came in after us, was served first. Additionally, I don't think anyone came to check on us after the food came. One of my lunch mates had to hunt down a carry out container for me. I would order from Siam again, but I would totally get take out."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. The coconut soup is delicious. Interior is not very impressive, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"black list. If you want to wait for your meals like forever then fine. Food is American style."}
{"text":"I was suggested this by a co-worker on a cold rainy day for lunch. I've had done mediocre Thai in the past and was willing to give it a shot. Wow was I impressed. I asked for a recommendation by the greater and got the green curry it fed myself and 2 other co-workers there was so much and it was that lovely amount of heat to make you sweat but not so hot I couldn't enjoy it. I liked it so much I went back the next day and made my fiance who hates curry try it and he loved it too!"}
{"text":"Yes! Love this place. I understand the service may not be the best, but if you become a regular they seem to loosen up :) I love the peanut sauce here. I could bathe in it! Every dish we have ordered so far has been great. The best part, if you want your food spiced \"hot\" they actually make it hot! Every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Charlotte won't spice my food over mild, even when I ask for extra hot. I try to go here every Thai \"Thursday\" :)"}
{"text":"Been here many times and the service is always awesome! During lunch time it is always busy! They have great military discount. The food is good and the price is very cheap. I would recommend coming here anytime! Granted the place is located in a not so appealing neighborhood... We have had no problems at all.. The pad see ew is very yummy and one of the faves... I love the options of having steamed tofu or fried tofu added to my meals... She is always smiling and great service goes a long way!"}
{"text":"A little whole in the wall restaurant in a bad area, but very popular amongst military folk.  After word of mouth from a couple of friends I finally went and I was very satisfied with the place.  As I walked in we were greeted by the owner. Who was so sweet, her prices were very cheep and the food was amazing.  By far one of my favorite places in Vegas. I had the pork curry level 4 with a coke and springs rolls, all under $13.00."}
{"text":"I always come here for the specials since its nearby. I love the spicy levels and the owner always makes an effort to make your visit welcoming and great! I don't mind the wait sometimes, because you can see her busting her butt to help the cook and take orders. She's amazing and I love this establishment. The food is amazing for the type of restaurant and the portions will fill you up. Also, the house fried rice is from the gods."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas! Great food, friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"The food always seems to taste a little off to me. Either too much of something or not enough. I've tried several items here. It's ok if you just want a quick thai fix but not the best thai I've had or close to it."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Had the Pad Prik and it was full of flavor and just enough heat. Chicken was good and veggies were crisp.  Did takeout and the order was ready fast and hot. Will go again while in town."}
{"text":"Walked in the door at a quarter to 6pm. The sign said open but the place was empty.  The dining room tables clearly weren't prepared for anyone.  I heard a couple of women talking in the back.  I could see one of them look through the window in the door of the kitchen and was sure she must have seen me plus the front door beeps when it's opened.  I stood there for probably 5 minutes but no one came out to greet me or anything. Looking over the dinner prices on the menu by the counter, it seemed like a bit more than I wanted to pay anyhow.  I probably would have ordered something anyway if they came out of the kitchen but since they didn't I ended up walking out empty handed. I've heard the food is good but sadly I'll probably never find out for myself.  Leaving a customer standing in an empty dining room for 5 minutes without greeting them is horrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place has to be the definition of a little hole in the wall. It's located in a small strip mall and is pretty tiny inside, only about 6 tables. The food though is definitely delicious.   A coworker and I came here for lunch and were luckily able to get a table right away. I decided to go with the yellow curry lunch special with tofu. The curry was super flavorful and had just the right amount of heat. The tofu was also cooked nicely too, not too soggy.   The ambiance of this place might not be all too nice, but I'd definitely recommend the food for a great Thai spot to eat on the north side."}
{"text":"I am here pretty often for lunch, probably once a week or so.  I love the owner, she is such a sweet woman and always takes up a lot of time chatting with us.  She always picks on me about how much sweet tea I drink :).  Speaking of tea, the sweet tea and jasmine tea are some of the best you can get!  Lunch always comes with a free cup of soup which is always different and delicious.  I do eat dinner here on occassion as I did tonight but mostly I am there for lunch.  I usually get the Pad Thai or the Red Curry.  The Red Curry is excellent and comes with a side of white rice.  It's honestly some of the best Red Curry I have ever had and beats Monsoon on South Blvd hands down.  The Pad Thai is great too and I usually order it with extra chicken and with 1 star (stars = heat index).  I also highly suggest the Thom Kha soup as it is similar to the Red Curry.   The free soup usually comes out pretty fast and the refills on drinks are pretty quick too.  Although sometimes they do get a little bogged down during lunch.  All in all this is a great place to eat if you like Red Curry and Pad Thai.  It's worth the trip to just hang out and talk to the owner!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall! Military discounts on top of the cheap food. There's only one waitress but the service is quick, they're very friendly and consistent. Beat the lunch rush and get there at 11am. You'll be wait for a table if you get there anytime after 11:15."}
{"text":"I've been eating Thai place around the states so maybe that's why I did not find it as tasty as other did , but portion size is very small flavor is not as flavorful , overall food was not that great. However if you're a first timer this will satisfy your craving ,customer service and price is on point . If your looking for the best place I really recommend Thai food to go super flavorful best one SO FAR."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  The food was tasty.  The lunch special comes with soup (dine in only) that is perfect for a cold day.  It was a rich, clear broth with carrots, cabbage, onions, and chunks of tofu.  The taste was complex and hearty despite the soups delicate appearance.  I'll come back for this soup when the weather gets cold for sure  :-)  The location was kind of odd, but the area is still growing up around it.  The ambiance was relaxing, the servers weren't particularly engaging, but they got the job done.  There was too much \"decor\" consisting of old faded pictures, golden deity items and curio cabinets filled with tiny boxes or tea sets.  Then when I got to the register, I noticed all the orchids lined up on the counter.  They're pretty, but wow- there's too many of them in the way.  Then my eyes fell to the make shift table made out of beer cases and menu boxes stacked beside the register and in front of the beer cooler.  This was puzzling.  Overall I'd have to say that the entire dining area was decorated by a loving grandmother type that kept all the school photos and every art project - LOL  It wasn't dirty or alarming in any way, but it's noticeably cluttered.  I'm not saying clutter is bad, but I will say it doesn't do much to build confidence for patrons.  I would definitely go again, and I do recommend it if you're in the area  :-)"}
{"text":"The service has been a lot better as of late, hence I felt it was ready for the full 5 stars. Fast, friendly, and always super delicious . It is easily one of my favorite places for lunch in Charlotte! The red curry is incredible."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's close to where I live and the food is amazing. I usually get Chicken on the Beach. It's a cup of rice with grilled chicken on top and on the side is some salad. The waitress is so sweet and she sometimes does different dressings or add cookies or pretzels with the salad. Great family owned business. it's very busy during lunch time but when I've gone around 1230-130 and it was a decent amount of people but not packed."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Came in at noon for lunch and place was packed. Small space for the amount of business it did while I was there. Although I only waited around five minutes for a table, it was about half an hour before I got my food that I ordered when waitress came to get drink order. Slow service and waitress wasn't very engaging nor did she check back on drink refill. Wouldn't mind going back, but definitely not during busier times.  As for the food, I felt the soup portion that came with my food was smaller than the one you get at Thai Taste. I got Pineapple Curry Fried Rice with chicken for my entree. It was my first time eating curry and I didn't care for it. Monsoon has a similar dish without the curry. Perhaps I'll trying something different next time or see if they can leave it out."}
{"text":"When you don't mind a short drive - okay, perhaps a long drive, depending on where you live - and don't really care about the atmosphere (because there really isn't none), then this may be your place.  I have to say, though, I really dig Siam Garden. The service isn't the best. Okay, it's probably close to the worst. They are not friendly at all. You need to know what you want, and it's on the order of the Soup Nazi. Even the Soup Nazi might be friendly compared to this place.  But the food is solid. You do have to be able to stomach looking at pictures of our former Mayor, Pat McCrory, however. Not sure why, really, as they aren't celebrity-style signed pictures, at least that I can tell, and this is actually before the recent issues with (now former) Mayor Cannon, so I really don't know what's up - maybe they just like the guy. It's a little stalkerish, however.  The good news is that unlike many other places in town, their spice level is legit. No US vs. Thai spices here - you'll get real spice when you ask for it, so be careful.  If you don't mind the drive, and you don't mind the service, and you don't mind the atmosphere, definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Service is wonderful and the food is amazing! Definitely my go to place for Thai."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Super friendly, family owned business. Any time I'm on this side of town I can't help but stop in. I love the green curry fried rice and the Thai coffee. Can't suggest this restaurant any higher!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Food around, both yellow and red curry are amazing. Would like to try more but can't get away from those two items."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner and this is 1 of my top 2 favorites in the area. Their food is always fresh and delicious with a price point that is very affordable. Check them out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Busy dumpy wonderful little place.  They don't care about social media or yelp reviews. They are a small family business putting out decent consistent food. And for the crappy area it's located in its good enough! (For me anyways)"}
{"text":"One of the best places in the area to grab lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy but good food and great hosts.  I've had just about everything on the menu over the years and love it all.  They'll make anything as spicy as you want it too.  Spicy level varies by the cook though as sometimes single digit numbers can be over powering but then 20 barely hurts.  But still so good!"}
{"text":"My family and I just went there. I got the pad Thai and my family ordered the pangan curry, Thai honey chicken, and pineapple fried rice. Everything was good but I'd say the pad Thai was lacking in flavor. It was just meh. I'd suggest the currys  that they have there. Service was good so no complaint there. The environment was friendly and very decorative. I'd go back again, but for the curry."}
{"text":"Alright I came back with an open mind and the Pad See Ew was still NOT ok.  You know what else is not ok? Being a waiter and not knowing what is on your menu. CMON!  The pad thai wasn't as terrible as the one at Thai House (near Ballantyne), but it was still not good. The texture of the noodles wasn't good, it was too saucy, and I didn't like the flavor. PLUS, they added peanuts when I said NO PEANUTS!  I guess I would be open to trying the curry, but I'm pushing this one down to a 1 star for now.  P.S. fortunately there was no line here today, but why is there usually a line at this place?!"}
{"text":"I've only dined in this restaurant once and I have never been back nor do I plan on going back. My boyfriend had their pad thai and I ordered their pad kee mao aka drunken noodles. The food was sooo sooo disappointing that I never wanted to return. My boyfriends pad thai was all goey and had no texture except goo and extra goo. I know the gooeyness  means they overcooked his noodles. Lets not even talk about my pad kee mao. It was probably hands down the worst i've ever tasted in my life. They should be ashamed of putting their name on it. All it tasted like was wide rice noodles doused in siracha sauce. It's shameful to even call it pad kee mao and should call it siracha noodles. End of story"}
{"text":"Awesome Yellow Curry and a really good Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Siam Garden is in a slightly sketchy area. How do I know this? Because the vagrant that wandered into the path of a dump truck bringing it to a screeching halt while I was waiting to turn told me through the acrid smoky cloud rolling off the tires of the truck. Because the sign on the C-store on the corner proclaimed it with it's broken marquee reading something like \"___OP AND B___\" Because the security gated doorways and litter strewn lot next door quietly whispered \"sketchy\" in my ear as I pulled in the lot.   I decided to give them a shot. I was hopeful because when I called to verify the location (and make sure they were still in business) the woman who answered the phone did not speak English.   There is essentially no ambiance here. It moved to Henderson several years ago. I was the only customer. Service was fast. It was almost like they were waiting for me. Or someone like me.   I started with Thai tea which was sufficiently tasty. The menu is pretty simple with mostly Thai dishes and a smattering of popular \"Americanized\" Chinese dishes like orange chicken.   I ordered chicken red curry, hot. I have not been satisfied with the heat of the curries I have had lately so I stepped up to hot. The dish came up quickly. The curry sauce had a coconut milk base but was more watery and less sweet than many I have had. Not a bad thing. It had an atypical assortment of veggies: okra, some sort of small green squash, red pepper, green pepper and some vegetable that I asked them to identify but have forgotten the name of already. And bay leaves. The chicken was white meat, plentiful and tender. Get an additional order of rice and this dish is enough for 2 people. For $6.99. In fact my total including the tea was about $9.25.  A decent and serviceable hole in the wall Thai place.  Oh, they close at 8.  Yes you read that right."}
{"text":"I've come twice and first time I wasn't overly impressed. I got pad Thai and was average. We decided to try again and based off other reviews did the yellow curry. It was really good and huge portion! It had good spice and creamy from the coconut. Yum and have become a fan. My husband got a noodle dish and it was really good too. I think pad Thai just isn't their specialty but get the curry!  I'm adding to my review I still love their yellow curry but the service is just horrible eating in or taking carry out. It's slow even when it's not busy there. I ordered to go and they told me 30 mins I ended up waiting another 25 mins when I arrived... An Hr wait is just not acceptable to me. If I didn't like their curry so much I would gave them a 1"}
{"text":"It was super packed at lunchtime, which seemed like a good sign. In retrospect, it was probaly packed because it is located in a business park with very few other options. The table was sticky, the waitress nonexistent, and the food was not that great. The clincher in my one-star rating was when a roach ran across my lap and the manager said \"sorry, we can't control those\". No comp. No offer of anything. She didn't really even bat an eyelash. Run, people. Run far."}
{"text":"I recently stopped here during my my lunch break. I called in my order and the woman on the phone was kind. I hadn't eaten there before but I love my food spicy. I ordered chicken fried rice spicy number five and it satisfied my taste buds. I also got green curry and thai chicken. It was all so good! Definitely check this place out if you want some amazing quality food"}
{"text":"Have tried it for a couple of times now and they have been amazing every time . Quick service and nice portions . Soup pots are awesome . Curries are  yummy and each is good for two people if you are ordering along with appetizers. Pad Thai and spring rolls are delicious too. Especially the spring roll sauce ."}
{"text":"If you're a college student at CSN and you're on a break, this is a great place to go. Good service, good food, nothing more you can ask for."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Love the owner. But my last two visits have guided my decision of not going back. When I asked for Thai spicy, the dish would be hair-raising. Last two times had no spice. What I am going to try to not to lose sleep over is how the lunch special L5 with chicken and a glass of HOUSE chardonnay cost twenty bucks. Over charged a dollar for meal and $8 for a tiny house wine. While their food is not super, guess I'm sticking with Thai House and Saigon Palace from now on since I don't like the feeling of being had."}
{"text":"So many things this restaurant has could mean it's a bad place, yet for Siam Garden they all work for it.   Shady part of town, tiny dining area, homey fixtures, cheezy animated pictures and one of those little fake waterfall setups.  That was my impression when I came here for the first time, then I started to notice a few things.  Like how clean it always is, how friendly and attentive the staff is, the pictures of all the smiling customers, and of course the food.    I've tried a pretty wide selection of their menu, soups, noodles, stir fry, and appetizers. Everything has been top rate, one of our favorites is the Thai beef jerky and sticky rice.  Their lunch specials are good and cheep, you always get plenty of food.  If you're in the military they have a discount too.    The other night we were eating here and I noticed how it feels like you're eating at a friends place, maybe not the in the formal dining room, with the florescent lights it's more like a table in the kitchen and that's alright, it's more comfortable."}
{"text":"This little Thai restaurant is a little hidden from the main area of restaurants in the Whitehall/ SW Charlotte area.  It's located in a strip of stores next to some corporate buildings.  I have been twice now and enjoyed it.  Granted, I'm no expert in Thai food, but I did like what I got, portions were sizable and the staff was very friendly.  They seemed to accommodate me with their vegetarian options with no problem.  I think it's more lively for lunch during the week for the business crowds.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The outside may be deceiving about the food on the inside.  I stopped by on my way out west with the family and all of our meals were very good.  The service was outstanding and they even gave us a free appetizer.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Just the best thai I have found.  Food is always consistent and favor is on point.  My go to spot in charlotte. Best to order takeout."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time. The sticky rice is the best ever, the jerky is soooooooooo good that that's all I order."}
{"text":"Great value/great taste/great service.  A lot of military folks from Nellis AFB and LVMPD officers from the new jail close by eat there during lunch.  Crab fried rice is a favorite."}
{"text":"Terrible service, worse food.  First we ordered spring rolls, which came about half an hour later (total of 8 people in restaurant at the time) and were rolled so tight there was practically nothing inside - just the fried \"roll\" part.  I ordered garlic chicken with broccoli and my husband ordered a tilapia dish.  Mine was bland bland bland and his was one tiny piece of fish amidst a lot of unappetizing sauce -completely overcooked.  I had to laugh that that pathetic piece of fish cost $17!  It took over an hour to get mediocre at best food with awful service. :-("}
{"text":"Had to work the Cheyenne Campus of CSN a few weeks ago, and I think as I've stated before I absolutely hate the dining options in that area.  Decided to give this place a go since Thai food literally always sounds good to me, and I went with the Mint Chicken lunch special because it was the closest to my usual Spicy Basil chicken that I order at all Thai joints.    First note:  DO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO GET DIRECTIONS TO THIS PLACE.  I'm batting about 60% success with their new maps as of 11/27/12, so I should have known better, but it had me circling around the Fresh and Easy parking lot which was about a quarter mile up the street (it had me turn right and not a left on LV Blvd from Cheyenne).  So yeah I started wondering if it was somehow connected to Fresh and Easy because a) I'm an idiot and b) Siri kept telling me I'd arrived.  Thanks Siri!   Anyway, I called the restaurant and they told me how to get there with what sounded like a smile on the other end of the phone.  When I arrived first thing I noticed was it was packed.   Literally 90% of the tables were full, and people seemed to be enjoying their meals.  It did make it a little uncomfortable to have to stand and wait with a few others who had takeout orders as well.  I dont know about them, but I felt like I was interfering with all the seated patrons' meals.  Besides that service was friendly and I was on my way quickly.    Getting back to my office I opened it up and was generally pleased with what I saw.  Unfortunately they don't have brown rice as an option which I should be used to by now but truth be told it still disappoints each and every time it happens.  I thought they nailed my spice level of 4 out of 5.  It had just enough kick but not so much that it caused an internal organ riot within.  Everything tasted okay, but my biggest issue was the texture and consistency of the chicken.  There's three types of chicken you can get when you order this sort of dish from a thai restaurant (some offer a choice, but I never ask for one way or another):  finely ground (a la Archis and Pin Kaow standard), finely sliced (a la Weera or Prommares), or the third kind which is some sort of amalgam of both of those versions.   I vastly prefer one or the other but not the mixed kind, which is what I got here.  There's something about the texture of it all when the chicken pieces seem halfway ground up or poorly chopped up.   Thankfully there wasn't a lot of fat involved which I've seen occur with this method, but in the end it still was pretty middle of the road for how I've experienced this dish.  I would certainly give this place another shot or two if I worked or lived close by, but given how few and far between I'm on that side of town, we are probably never ever getting back together.  Like ever."}
{"text":"Cute little spot I stopped at with family on the way to the airport. Ordered some spring rolls and satay to start, they were alright, some of the flavors were a little lighter than I've come to expect from similar places. Their peanut sauce was a little meal-y with the satay, but seemed fresh. Make sure to specify if you want the meat spring rolls otherwise they'll default to vegetarian.   We also ordered noodle soup (their iteration very close to pho), the Panang curry, and their pad kee mao. Other reviews point out that their noodle dishes are not their strong suit, and I would strongly agree; the pad kee mao was instead a sriracha noodle dish. Would definitely opt towards getting their curries or anything that is not their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Great little Thai place close to Nellis AFB. Fast service and friendly wait staff delivering hot and fresh Thai dishes. Their menu is not expansive but the dishes they do offer are well prepared. Prices are reasonable. Chicken Pad Kee Mow for lunch with a water. $6.95"}
{"text":"this place is small compared to other Thai places. It didn't seem too busy today, but it was alright. The food was mediocre I prefer thai house. we ordered the angel wings, crab ragoon, pad thai, red curry, and pad see ewe. The angel wings had little to no flavor and were kind of chewy. I wouldn't recommend the wings. The crab ragoon lacked flavor too and was over cooked. The pad thai was a little dry and had a weird taste. The red curry tasted better than the other dishes, but had a good bit of coconut in it so it's up to your preference. The pad see ewe was not made well and had a funny taste to it. The service was alright we only had our drinks refilled once. The waitress was nice though. I would give this restaurant a 2/10."}
{"text":"I was in a Thai mood and Siam Garden is near the Walmart I was headed to so I decided to give it a try.  It's kind of off the beaten bath.  The restaurant is in a strip mall in a business park off Arrowwood just past 485.  The place wasn't busy, just a couple of tables when I stopped in.  The decor was pretty typical for an asian restaurant.  It looked clean and well maintained.  When ever I have Thai food I pretty much always order Pad Thai, which is what I did today.  My meal came with soup and a fried spring roll.  The soup was interesting with chunks of pineaple in it along with some ground meat. (beef?)  Whatever it was the broth was light and tasted good.  My main dish came out pretty quickly after I finished my soup.  The spring roll was kind of small, but it really was just an added bonus as I didn't expect to get it.  The Pad Thai was tasty and hot.  I'm not much of an expert on Thai food, but like art, I know what I like and this was pretty good.  I'm pretty sure the person serving me was the owner of the restaurant.  My service was OK, but it seemed like she was more interested in the regulars at the other tables.  She did chat with me a bit when she brought my check though.  The price was very reasonable at $7.95 for my lunch.   I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Since my first review of this place, I have been a regular and every single time, dine-in or take-out, they are so consistently good that I decided to pop that 5th star right in. Seriously, you can't get better Thai home cooking than this in the valley. Wish they were open on weekends but I'll tke what I can get, hours-wise. Great, tasty, homestyle Thai here....never disappoints."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food in Northeast Las Vegas during Thai Thursday (which is every Thursday mind you...) this is my go to restaurant. My favorite dish is their green curry Thai fried rice with chicken, level 15. This restaurant knows how to add some heat to the food without ruining the amazing flavor I've come to love.  Working on base and planning ahead allows my wife and I, or office, to order our meals for pick up and complete our weekly tradition. In the three years of ordering from Siam Garden we have never had a mistake with our orders or any complaints.   So why 4/5 stars? One reason and one reason only, their ability to match their supply and demand is bad. This place is so good folks will wait over an hour to eat here, however, coming here for a sit down lunch is almost impossible due to this. In my five attempts to sit and eat we were successful twice. We had to cancel or get our already ordered meal to go. I recommend these folks moving to a larger location and hiring some more folks. The, \"if you build it, they will come\" adage strongly applies to this awesome crew.   Until then 4 outta five stars for awesome food, amazing staff, and reliable service!"}
{"text":"Love my chicken fried rice! Spicy and flavorful I recommend this place to all my spicy food lover friends."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food in town. Small family owned place with very friendly service and they will make your dish however you want it. You would have to really make a effort to get your bill over $15 for two people.  You could pay $50 for the same thing on the Strip and it will not be anywhere near as good. Very much a lunch or early dinner place (I think they close at 7) Go early because it gets packed very fast for lunch with Nellis and CSN nearby."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Anytime I want Thai, this is where you'll find me.    The place is very small, only one (very nice) server, but the food is worth the deficiencies.  Lunch can be crowded, so the best time to go is odd hours or get there at open.  My all time favorite is the pineapple fried rice level-3, but I usually try to order something additional just to try other things.  Never disappointed.    Prices are more than reasonable and it's just an overall pleasant experiences!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan.  Very good thai food that is reasonably priced.  Not way overpriced like Basil Thai is.  Do not get me wrong, basil thai is very good but very overpriced.  Some menu items here are better than others.  In general I like all of the curries (green, red, jungle curry).  Also, the chicken cococnut soup is very good."}
{"text":"It's a nice Thai place with a welcoming sweet host. Went their for dinner got the Siam rolls and salad for appetizers, were tasty and served with the fabulous peanut sauce. For my entree I had the red curry with tofu, it's very well seasoned. I asked for it medium hot and that was actually hot for me, so just be careful ordering how hot you want it. Overall it's a good place to try out!"}
{"text":"So I come here for lunch quite a bit. I recommend getting the Tom Ka Chicken or Shrimp with rice in it, spiced to your comfort level.  My coworker usually gets mint chicken allthough it's not on the menu. I also had the sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. Affordable and good food.   Hot tip! Listen for fighter jets if you wanna know if it's busy or not for lunch. Jets = not busy. No jets = busy.   Yum yum"}
{"text":"West Charlotte is a bit of a restaurant desert. Off of I-485 this way, there aren't many places to eat. And this is a relatively new strip plaza, so when I pulled over to let Yelp find me a late dinner, I was pleased when this popped up.  I chose the fresh spring rolls with shrimp to start. These were prepared very quickly and were pretty good. A nice portion of shrimp in there with a bowl of cold peanut sauce for dipping.  But before I'd even manage to dig into a second spring roll, my Pad Thai with chicken arrived. Good texture and plenty of chicken, but the flavor was rather bland. No heat at all.  There were a couple of other tables, but they already had their food when I arrived. So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy? Or should I have spoken up?"}
{"text":"Decently priced, good lunch specials, and friendly staff.  The trifecta of a good local spot.  Keep in mind that while the menu states that the spiciness level is from 1 to 5, they will go much higher if requested.  The number is the amount of Thai peppers they put in your entree.  I have a pretty high tolerance for spiciness, and 15 was good for me.  The wall is decorated with photos of people who have gone much higher.  If you are curious, ask the waitress about the woman who holds the record. Hint: it's 151."}
{"text":"I landed in this place for lunch today. I have not had dinner here. Very consistent and excellent food. It is in a strip mall so its easy to overlook. The interior is nothing to get excited about but the food is worth the visit. Killer soups. Curry dishes are really good and the Gang Masaman rocks. I don't know, but if they were well funded and moved this to a better location and poured money into the decor... watch out, big breakout potential. Family owned with some very nice people running it. I think its a couple of sisters or at least relatives. Always crowded, really crowded at lunch. Draws from many of the local businesses west of the airport. You will probably need to Google the location or pull out the GPS. It deserves a 3.5 rating"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Food is amazing. Its always fresh & hot. The only downfall to this restaurant is the size & lack of workers. The room gets packed during lunch & there's only one young lady working as the hostess, server, buser & cashier. Im surprised they don't have her tasked as a cook as well. Either way, she does a great job and the food is great. Highly recommend (but not during the lunch rush if it is your first time)"}
{"text":"Yum. Just YUM. I walked in and there were 3 other tables. The waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful. She knew I was in a rush and brought everything out quickly. I got fried tofu pad thai to go. It's tasty, The tofu isn't oily like I've had at other Thai places before. It's good. I had the Tom Yum soup with chicken while I waited for my pad thai. Oh. My. God. I will have dreams about this soup. It's just starting to cool off and get windy in Vegas and this hit the spot. Actually, it hit ALL the spots. YUM. I ordered spicy level 3 on both dishes. My mouth is still numb fromt the soup. They have a little sign on the wall saying they have spicy levels up to 5 because it is very spicy but if you want spicier, just ask, they go up to 15. 15!! The 3 was enough to cause my eyes to water and my sinuses to clear and I LOVE and am very used to spicy food. If anyone tries the 15, let me know. I'd be curious to see if you can still speak."}
{"text":"First time here and I will probably be a frequent customer based on my first experience. I ordered the Siam Yam salad with calamari. Beautiful artful presentation and nicely balanced flavors with just the right amount of heat (significant, but not overpowering). Portion size was generous. The owner was lovely and friendly."}
{"text":"Always on the look-out for the next great Thai place...  When a couple friends suggested we get Thai and head to this place I was definitely game and quite pleasantly surprised.  This restaurant sits in the middle of the Whitehall office park.  I'm sure it probably gets most of its traffic during the week at lunch times, but coming here Sunday night... the place was pretty empty.  I was a little skeptical riding down the road since it is pretty far away (if you are coming off of S. Tryon).  We later figured out it was seconds away from the 485/Arrowood Rd exit.  Now the most important part:  the food was delicious!  It was actually refreshing to see more options than the usual Thai chains that have their pad thais and currys.  We all started out with a curry puff appetizer which was gone in 10seconds.  I ordered a Tom Yum soup since I was starving at this point in the day and I had run something crazy [9 miles] in the morning.  The Yellow curry with chicken at \"hot\" level was pretty darn perfect for me.  I liked how the heat slowly built up and was not too mild and not too blazingly hot.  The rice to curry ratio was perfect.  Our greeter/server/ (and maybe cook?)  [Hopefully she had more help in the kitchen that I didn't see]  Was super charming and personable.  She recognized me as a newbie and asked me where I lived.  I told her, \"Matthews\" with a sad expression since it was kind of a drive to get here.  She did say that she has regulars that drive in from Waxhaw....  Despite the location, I definitely will keep this one on my list.  It is currently at the top for Thai at the moment (until I find something equally as delicious and charming near Matthews)."}
{"text":"I had planned on hitting another Thai place today for lunch but due to traffic on Arrowood Rd we went right instead of fighting traffic and decided to give Siam Garden another try.  Unfortunately, all the reasons why I had stayed away became evident once again when we entered.  There wasn't a clean table in the place so we were forced to wait until one was cleaned off.   Then we waited 10 minutes for menus and utensils.  We ordered.  I ordered no rice but my dish came with it anyway.    The food was ok this time.  The vegetables were barely cooked and a slice of carrot was actually raw.  The dish didn't even look appetizing.  I don't know what to say about the service.  When I said thank you after they filled up my water glass, all I heard was a grunt.  Yes, a grunt.  I'd expect that if I were in a biker bar but not a Thai restaurant.  It's sad, I used to be a fan of this place but now I'm to the point I will never return."}
{"text":"Love this place, easy to overlook but when you do find it I highly recommend. I haven't tried anything on the menu that I didn't like. Staff is friendly and patient. The decor is really homey, covered with things I suspect customers bring I like kid drawings and colorings. Then the challenge pictures of patrons doing there challenge. Level 15 heat is hot enough but if you want to go to lavel 69 they're game."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Siam Garden three times since I found out about the place, it will be four times by Thursday, twice for take-out and once actually at the restaurant. It is a little hole in the wall place with hardly any \"ambience\", but I mean really, it's a hole in the wall Thai place. I'm there for the food, not the decoration. I've had the Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen, Tom Yum soup, and house salad...and all were very tasty. The Pad Woon Sen is a personal favorite, with clear rice noodles, egg, thick cut cucumbers and tomatoes. The veggies add a nice cooling aspect to the dish when you order it 'hot'. The Tom Yum soup was also very tasty, fragrant of lemongrass and just enough spice to counteract the sour. The Pad Thai is not the BEST I've ever had, but it was still tasty and I would probably order it again. The salad was like any other regular salad, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion...but also pineapple and a TASTY dressing. The dressing was slightly sweet and creamy. I almost wish they would bottle and sell it!  Oh, you also usually get a spring roll with your meal. It is fantastic. The skin is fried to a crispy brown perfection. It retained a bit of the oil in the wrapper, but it's not too greasy like most fried foods and it didn't leach onto the veggies inside.  The waitress (same one every time I've been - she may be the only one they have) is always very polite and extremely nice. Both times I went in and ordered take-out she always offered a glass of water while I waited for my food.  While this isn't the BEST Thai place I've eaten at, it's definitely a place worth trying, especially if you work in the area like I do. OH - and they also give a 10% discount to military, police, firefighters, CSN professors, and students!!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant! It's very small, so don't expect to house multiple people. Very polite server and hard worker. She checked up on my friends and I's food. The lunch specials are very decent if you are student!"}
{"text":"Just visiting and so happy we stopped in. It's a little whole in the wall but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting on my to go food. I've never actually eaten here before but absolutely love good ethic food especially Thai. The woman at the front is rude. She is unfriendly and slow. The phone rings at least ten times every time before she answers. It's loud and disruptive but she ignores it . When she finally does answer she snaps and tell them they close in a hour and any order put it will take at least 30 minutes. You can tell she hopes they don't order anything.   I hope the food is better than the service is already"}
{"text":"Best curry in town. Best curry anywhere. Recommended to this place by a world traveler who said they have the best curry he's had anywhere. Sweet staff. Always quiet and super helpful. Good portions. Always some to take home!  Get the spring rolls or dumplings. And green or yellow curry!  It's our staple!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is great and they use very fresh ingredients. If you go around 11-1 you might have to wait because they do a very busy lunch business but the food is worth it."}
