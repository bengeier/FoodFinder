{"text":"There are very few places that satisfy my entire family. This one does. Great food, large portions, great value and super friendly staff! The lunch entrees for around $6 include soup, egg roll or crab puff and a nice serving of your entree and fried rice. The sesame chicken is my favorite. Its fresh and tastes great. The location is right next to Kohls and Sprouts - so you can do a little shopping afterward too! Its worth the drive for a super yummy lunch!"}
{"text":"The waitress ( short  one length hair with black uniform) is so rude and uneducated. Didn't want to argue cuz she might spit on our food."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to love this place and ate there frequently; Unfortunately until one time we had carry out and when we got home (1mi up the street) the food was cold and the rice was hard.. After contacting them about it they were totally rude and unprofessional.. I haven't been back since.. Customer satisfaction is key when having this type of business.."}
{"text":"4 stars for service; 2 for food on the day of that gets slightly better as leftovers.  I was really hoping that I was going to love this place because it's very clean, the owners/servers are very nice, and the overall feel of the place is better than many of the other Chinese restaurants in the area.  But I found the broccoli chicken and Mongolian beef to be very bland; the flavors only slightly perked up the next day when I ate the leftovers."}
{"text":"The chinese lady answering the phone is rude. Even in person she is rude. My husband and I had the same experience. I had a hard time understanding her broken english and she seems annoyed by that. So i told her your english is not easy  to understand , her reply?  \"i know my english sucks\". (Not in a nice tone btw and went to the kitchen talking in her language) I wanted to talk to the manager but accdg to the waiter she is the manager.. Made me laugh."}
{"text":"I get chinese food almost every week from here :)! Small and family owned, I've only had good experiences from this place. Best in town. They were SLAMMED this past Valentines Day but were handling it with class. I love how they have steamed dishes with the sauce on the side. One time I ordered for pick-up I forgot to take the sauce with the order. They called me back to make sure I got it!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I would have loved to place a to-go order from, however, I did not (and will not) for the following reason. The \"sit-down\" lunch specials include (among other things) soup, however, soup is not available/included on orders to go (and there is no price reduction on the to go orders to reflect soup not being included).

Let's get with it guys!!! - after all, to-go containers for soup have been around for a long, long time! In the meantime, you are losing business due to not having these."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at a a reasonable price. My family eats here a couple times a month. Employees are always very friendly, service is fast and the food is tasty.  

I am a Chinese food snob when it comes to the quality of the meat I will eat.  Every dish I have tried has had lean, top quality meat with fresh vegetables and delicious sauce.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the lettuce wraps and the portions they give! I'm actally going now!! lol"}
{"text":"Swift delivery, large portions and pretty tasty food. Placed order and was told would be 45 minutes for delivery which I'm used to for Chinese but to my surprise the food arrive just under 30 minutes! Warm food and great portions I have enough food for leftovers. Oh and we ordered quite a bit of food, a sesame chicken combo which was a bit more sweet than spicy than I liked, but came with soup, egg roll, two crab puffs and fried rice, orange chicken with fried rice, 2 more orders of fried rice, and some general tso chicken."}
{"text":"I come here regularly. Great Chinese food. Quality service and nice workers. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent value, fast service.  We love to order a few dishes on Sunday and use the leftovers for lunch for a few days!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to try this place out for lunch yesterday. Its a nice place with a big selection of food and it's all good. Until you get hair in 2 out of the 3 plates you get. Completely disgusting. We stopped eating after finding the black hair. After we got home, I got food poisoning from their food! It was the only thing I ate that day and my boyfriend had different foods from me. I was sick for 5 hours. Terrible experience. Never again will we go back to this horrid place!"}
{"text":"Very impressed and completely satisfied with our lunch visit. We had the Chicken Lo Mein, General Tso Chicken and Orange Chicken lunch specials. Very generous portions for a great price. The food was authentic and so very good. So Glad we found this gem and looking forward to our next visit to try the many other items on their menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the east valley.
The portions are very generous (a la cart) and the taste is phenomenal!
I love Chinese food and I've tried many restaurants that claim to be the best.
JK's doesn't claim to be best, they are just the BEST!

Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I totally love this place. I've called in a few orders on the phone and I almost always have modifications I request. Every time the staff is very polite and courteous and my orders are consistently accommodated the way I request them. 

The restaurant is clean and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. My most recent trip in, the woman who appeared to be managing was stopping at tables, thanking her guests for coming in and checking on the food. My boyfriend and I each ordered spicy dishes and she specifically asked if the spice level was to our liking.

Food always tastes freshly cooked, veggies are always well prepared and service is quick!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food restaurant in the area. I have been going here since 2005 and have never had any complaints. Service is one of the best and i am always pleased by the food and the best customer service. Other restaurants should take note. Anyhow if your looking for some good Chinese food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Disappointed  the past two times I've been here. It will be a while before we go back for sure. Prices way too high for the quality received past two takeouts. Unfortunate since was great in the past. Be aware."}
{"text":"So, from the moment I walked in no knew I would hate it. I'm from NYC and believe I know what rude is. First, I walked in and all the staff was eating and I seemed to have interrupted their family meal... sorry I wanted to buy some food. I was however greeted immediately by the rudest little lady. Instead of being warm and welcoming it seemed like she just wanted to get me out of there. She wasn't very helpful in fact I asked her if I can substitute fried rice for the white rice but she said that wasn't allowed?! That was the most ridiculous thing anyone anywhere has ever told me--- instead she gave me a meal and then gave me another portion of just  fried rice which I then came to realize was done to charge me double! I wouldn't have cared if she would have charged me extra but she had an attitude and game me double the food at double the price. It wasn't a crazy ridiculous price but just to compare... in NYC I can get replace my white rice for fried rice and for the same meal I'd pay 8 bucks at any time of the day... if you want to be greeted as if you intruded on someone's family because you wanted to pay for your own go there... thenfoods ok but nothing like NYC Chinese food..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and had delivered a few times. Every time we ordered a large quantity and variety of food from here. Every time, every person loved every dish they picked. 

I think it's a pretty good sampling of their quality, which so far has easily been 10/10 every time. Their ingredients and cooking styles remind me of some of the old fashioned and authentic places I'd eaten at in my home town. Ingredients tasted and smelled fresh every single time, the flavors were rich and full. 

Portion and cost is another thing that should be commended. As many similar places go, JK has massive portions at very good prices. You only need to order a few items to feed a couple people for days, and the price is surprisingly low."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food.!!   Had the hot and sour soup as an appetizer, followed by \"double pleasure\" shrimp and scallops... Yum.!   Kiddo had wonton soup & enjoyed it-  I would be excited to have this in my 'hood..."}
{"text":"My family and I eat from here about once a month. We have only dined in once so my review is based on the take out we get.

Phone orders are always places fast and easy! The dinner specials for 1 are a great value. So much food for around $10! I love that the kids meal comes with fries bc my daughter does not like rice. 
The general taos chicken is tasty. The hot and sour soup is amazing! 
The only thing that would make this place better is if they delivered."}
{"text":"Great food!  Its hard to find good Chinese food in the East Valley. I usually go to The Great Wall, which is decent but J and K is much more flavorful. We had takeout so I cannot speak to service other than a quick call and a 10 minute wait."}
{"text":"The food is great... We had the crispy chicken and the Mongolian beef. The staff is very friendly and attentive... Recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant!  We have never had anything but fast and friendly service.  The menu is varied and very reasonably priced.  The Chinese Sausage Fried Rice is to die for.  All of the food is fresh and always delicious.  I am a huge fan of egg drop soup and this places egg drop soup is the best I've had.  We highly recommend going and taking the whole family!  We are a family of 5 and it never breaks the bank."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE Chinese food! Been going here for 5 years! Consistent and delicious everytime and the price is right. The owners are very nice and hard working. They often work the cashier or delivery. Love them, they're so nice. I love coming to a place where it's neighborhood friendly! My favorite is salt and pepper pork chop, hong kong style beef, Chinese broccoli, honey chicken, chicken with crispy rice and fried chicken! Check them out!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of picky when it comes to Chinese food.  J & K got decent reviews - so, it was worth a try.  Well, it was okay.  It seems like J & K caters to the American chinese food more than the traditional (which is sometimes fine if I'm in the mood for kung pao or the like).  This means that if you want spicy, go elsewhere.  And the flavors were a little on the bland side.  Still, it wasn't terrible.  Since I live relatively close, I'd probably return if I really needed a quick fix for Chinese food.  However, I'm relatively new to the area.  So, I'll keep looking for more authentic cuisine and probably frequent those more often once I find them."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been sold.  The food used to be excellent, now mediocre.  The thing is they keep claiming that the chef is the same.  They cannot fool a customer who has been coming here since the restaurant opened.  Disappointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! my husband, myself and our 8 children LOVE IT! A unanimous thumbs up vote is unusual for our Bunch!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to see a Chinese place close to our house since we love Chinese food.  When we walked in it looked like a nice place and very open.  The service was fine, but when we got our food that was another story.  I ordered the Chow Mien and my wife got the Orange Chicken.  The chow mien was pretty bad it was very greasy and just didn't  seem right.  My wife said her Orange Chicken was alright but she said she wouldn't order again.  

We didn't think too bad of the place when we left, but that night we were both sick to our stomaches.  We have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Really great Chinese. By far the best local Chinese I've had in Arizona in the past eight years. We ordered the general tso chicken and Mongolian beef with hot sour soup, crab Rangoon and an egg roll. Mongolian beef could've used more spice and more green onion but the beef was very tender. The general tso chicken was excellent. The batter on the chicken was perfect and crisp. Chicken was slightly overcooked, but I'd rather have over cooked than under cooked. Sauce was very tasty but again could've been spicier for me. The hot sour soup and egg roll was on par but nothing earth shattering. The crab Rangoon was a bit sweet for my liking but good otherwise. Delivery was very fast. Even if it wasn't, I would still be happy to order delivery again. There really aren't many Chinese restaurants that deliver anymore. I will definitely frequent this local gem."}
{"text":"Food was ice cold and flavorless. Had to order food from somewhere else because it was inedible."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Delicious food, great service and it's always clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is small but clean. We were promptly seated and served. We each ordered lunch specials ( meal comes with soup, eggroll or crab puff and the entree). I had the lemon chicken,  my friends had the mongolian chicken and the General Tso chicken. While my dish was tasty,  theirs was pretty good, but not spicy as advertised.  The fried rice was decent;  tasted slightly like it was steamed.  Overall, a nice meal for the price."}
{"text":"I had the Pan-fried noodles with shrimp and the Garlic Green Beans. They were delicious and will keep this place on my list next time I'm craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  It was totally different than any other local Chinese restaurant that I have ever been to and I really felt that I got a taste of what the Chinese Culture is really like. 

I ordered the orange chicken which was some of the best I had ever had. The breading wasn't too thick and the flavor was great. Before the actual entrée came out, they brought us egg drop soup which was also pretty good. The portions were all good size and we were really happy with our meal overall.

Although the service could have been better, I would still highly recommend giving it a try. Definitely worth it in my opinion! It is much better than any of the chain restaurants around here."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place because the food is high quality and the price is fair for the amount you get. Clean inside and the service is great. We have been there a dozen times and get something new each time.  Must Try!"}
{"text":"I ordered this delivery. The people that work there speak very broken English and it's hard for them to understand you. When we did get our food it was mediocre. My husband and I felt sick after eating it. Sorry but I wouldn't come back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I've only been here once--for lunch.  Pretty slow during weekday lunch and they were able to get my food out quickly.  The service was responsive.  The portions were much larger than average.  The food was good, for the most part, and I would have given a solid 4 stars, but my schezuan fish was a little mushy and the egg drop soup was mediocre.  Garlic green beans were very good and the salad dressing (some sort of cilantro vinagrette) was excellent.  Overall, a good meal and an excellent value, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Very quick delivery and is hot upon arrival. Large portions for a great price. Awesome lunch specials too. A couple of my favorites : gang pang beef (spicy), sweet & sour chicken (white meat and crispy) hot & sour soup (actually packs some heat) and shrimp and scallops in lobster sauce!!!! Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoy J&K's food.  Service is hit or miss, especially if you wind up receiving table service from one of the managers or owners...both of them are seriously lacking in the smile department.  However, our most recent visit \"Tammy\" was our server. She was super friendly, very attentive, and the order was correct.  

Side note, my order arrived at least five minutes before my husband's.  However, it was a pleasant experience.  We have dined here and ordered take-out more than a handful of times, and more often than not, the food and service were very good.  I would not give it a 5 because of some of the inconsistencies, i.e., ordering NOT SPICY and I was nearly thrown out of my chair with red pepper flakes, and occasionally too much oil or sauce drowns out the rest of the food.  Order specifically!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We got take out on Christmas night and loved all of it.  The pan fried noodles, beef and broccoli, and chicken schezuwan were all amazing.  Good size portions and most of the items were served in nice sturdy containers.  The meat and all the vegetables were really fresh.  Glad this place was open and we had a good Christmas dinner.  The place was packed when we went to pick up our food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with my family and I have really enjoyed the food! They give you a lot of food for a low price, which is always nice. The service is also really good and the food is made fresh so your orders are easily customizable. My personal favorite is the egg drop soup. I definitely recommend and will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I eat here often because it is close to where I live. Good clean Chines food but it is all starting to taste the same like they use the same sauce on many of their dishes. It didn't used to be like that. I will keep going because it is still good and the best one close to my house IMHO, but it is time for a menu or sauce change to get some new flavors for those who eat there often."}
{"text":"Really good food, and very friendly staff.  That's what I've experienced rather consistently when getting my Chinese food fix on here.  I've had a tough time finding Chinese food in Gilbert that hasn't been somewhat uninspiring.  
I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit to J&K, and have been going back ever since, especially since I can order for delivery with my DoorDash app and pay with Apple Pay!
They get the fried rice right, without the greasiness.  When we've asked them to hold the green peas on the fried rice, they have always obliged. (Its the little things...).
The green beans are the bomb.  I can do an entire meal on them.  Oink.
Well done, guys!
I'm hooked."}
{"text":"1. Way overpriced, food is not very good at all
2. \"Entrees\" are a huge pile of white rice with no veggies and a few pieces of meat or noodles
3. I ordered takeout and realized when I got home half my meal was missing

Overall poor value for what you get"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened. Absolutely loved it. The last 2 times I have ordered from here I was surprised. It is not the same, just blah and the flavor of the egg rolls and crab puffs are totally different. Then today I discovered it had been sold last March. Well that explains it. New management.  So sad. Will have to look for a new Chinese food establishment now. This place just doesn't cut it anymore. (sad face)"}
{"text":"Great food. We had the egg fried rice,egg rolls and beef low fun noodles and chow mein and the cashew chicken. Portions are plentiful and great flavors. Food is ready upon arrival and hot. Way better than the big chain Chinese food places near our home."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese in Gilbert/Queen Creek area. Ordered the broccoli and beef, Kung Pao chicken, and Honey Chicken. Lots of fresh bright veggies!!! Yummy! Will be back"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I've had.  Usually go for more authentic Chinese food, but tried this place since it was close by.  All the dishes tasted the same.  Just really sweet and too saucy...Very American Chinese, but not good American Chinese.   Panda Express is so much better!  Or try Yao's on Gilbert!"}
{"text":"So I thought that good chinese food was not in Gilbert.  Finally have been proved wrong.  This place is delicious.  Always full and always delivers fresh food.  

Kung pao chicken was spicy and tasty.  Lo mein is fresh and tasty.  Mongollian beef was a little lacking in spice but still good.  

The soups were really good.  I had the luck of being able to sample the egg drop and the hot and sour.  Both real good.

The decor is typical Chinese food restaurant.  Kind of homey.

Prices are typical and justified.

Remember to eat your cookie not the fortune."}
{"text":"KEEP AWAY... Went there for the first time last night, will not go back. We ordered \"pot stickers\" as an appetizer. The worst we ever had. The dough was very thick, tough, and very chewy. Plus they were under cooked. I ordered \" Moo-shu pork\". Absolutely disgusting. No plum sauce inside plus they actually used flour tortillas that are used for burritos. And they were served cold and soggy. I called over the server and complained and all she said was \"oh, okay\". That's all. No attempt to correct either issue plus I was still charged full price for lousy food. KEEP AWAY..."}
{"text":"So tasty! And it was delivered....Mongolian Beef was very good had it with egg fried rice.  Also ordered Egg drop soup"}
{"text":"They have great food here.  It was busy and I suspect that it's busy often with many people picking up orders for take out . In any case the staff has always been polite to me or my family."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Definitely the best Chinese food that we have had in Phoenix! Maybe the best we have ever had!
Their hot and sour soup is so good and the perfect balance of tart and spicy. 
We typically get the general tso's combination platter to share. It's the perfect amount so that you don't over eat. 
The breeding on the chicken is so crispy yet light and the seasoning is perfect. Not too spicy but it still has a kick. Their crab puffs are delicious and their egg rolls have a completely different taste to them. They have some sort of spice in them that make them so delectable!!
We come here at least once a month because we are always craving it!!"}
{"text":"J&K is very fortunate that our family really likes their food because I just called to order takeout and I have never had anyone be so rude to me over the phone.  

Basically not understanding and repeating over and over again.  

It took over 4 minutes to order 4 entrees and will take 30 minutes before we can pick it up."}
{"text":"Good food.  Atmosphere nothing to brag about. Service was quick and friendly.  Wide selection.  Salt and pepper chicken is good."}
{"text":"I came here two times now in two days in a row. I ordered the House Special and Mongolian Beef and chicken fried rice. The chicken fried rice was on point, it had the right balance of flavors and the rice was cooked perfectly. The color on the fried rice was legit too. As you can read I really loved the friend rice and will definitely come back here again to try the rest of the dishes."}
{"text":"I gave it five stars because it's the best 'fast food' Chinese place around.  You have to go to a $$$$ Chinese food place to do better.  Just by comparison Panda Express is a 1.5 star. They have a huge selection.  We mainly order take out but eating there is good too.  If your in the area try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Rating based on Awesome Lunch prices! $6.95 for a lunch box... 2 adults and a kiddo total was $18 plus a tip.  Sweet and Sour chicken pieces were quite large and the egg drop soup was yummy as was the side salad (had a cilantro vinaigrette)."}
{"text":"Food isn't anything special, everything Ive tried is very soggy and isn't made with the best quality meat."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and always great food. Our go to's are the chow fun, lo mein and any of the combos. They are one of the few places that deliver your soup with the combo also. Combos also come with egg roll and crab puffs."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a week and the food is amazing. Always fresh and always fast. The staff is super nice and remembers me every time. By far the best Chinese in gilbert."}
{"text":"So delicious! Such a great find. Their wonton soup is definitely one of my all time favorites. I have ordered many different things off the menu and none have been a disappointment. When we dine in our service is great and when we pick up, our order is always ready."}
{"text":"Wow!  Staying in some apartments nearby for a week and saw the young delivery man. Took a chance and loved their Walnut shrimp, crab puffs, and potstickers.  And FAST!  Here and hot in 15 minutes.  Yummy."}
{"text":"We used to love J&K gourmet...until tonight. They told us an hour for our food. After waiting an hour and 15 minutes we called because our food had not yet arrived. The lady then told us that we were wrong and they had told us an hour and a half. Two hours went by and we called again and asked where our food was and she told us that we had cancelled our order. Which we did not. We are extremely disappointed and sad at their lack of customer service. We will never use J&K again!"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter last night on the recommendation of a buddy; I was quite pleased.  We ordered the potstickers, and a sesame chicken plate that could easily have fed three people.  It came with a table order of those greasy fried delicious Chinese chips with sour sauce and white rice (which my daughter loves): the meal included soup, salad, egg roll, 2 crab rangoon, the sesame chicken, and a side of rice (I subbed fried rice for a buck more).  The service was attentive to say the least.  At times I felt like the lady was a part of my group.  The water was filled promptly, the food came out and was absolutely delicious.  All white meat chicken and juicy as heck.  She came with multiple boxes and the check when I asked for it and the food tasted just as good on day two!

This is a must do if you're in the Gilbert/Chandler area.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and comes in a timely  manner whether pick up or dinning in."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's usually great food. But, there was a bent metal nail-like thing in my food 5 minutes ago. Hurt my tooth, almost swallowed. Will attach photo. We order from them a lot - and it's usually good. But the fact that they said they wouldn't refund the order, (they did say credit next time) but, it's really a black mark on a business to not step up and do the right thing. I'm not a complainer - seriously. But I almost ate metal and they said no refund. Cmon now, that sucks... end of rant. Had to tell someone."}
{"text":"Here is the short version: Awesome best Chinese food in Arizona with super fast carryout and short to the point/cold phone etiquette.

I drive past two other chinese places to get food from here. When I call to place the order I already have my shoes on and once I hang up I immediately leave. They usually say 10 or 15 minutes but the food is always waiting on me when I get there 10 minutes after I hang up. You better be ready to order once you call. A guy who answers is nicer than the female, but they all have a accent. They will only ask you for your phone number and what you want, then say \"10 minute.\" They are very short and to the point.

I've never sat down to eat there so I can't comment on that.

You walk up to counter, pay and walk out. Not much to it, but the food is awesome. Only place that has chicago size larger egg rolls. For some reason places don't carry them out here."}
{"text":"J&K has great food in this area.  We've tried other places and keep coming back.  The staff is friendly, the food is good and the place is always busy.  Highly recommend J&K if you live in the area.  My only gripe is that they serve Coke instead of Pepsi."}
{"text":"We needed a quick lunch spot and found this on the good ole Yelp! It was super fast, cheap, and delicious! The lunch special was a super great deal and plenty to fill you up! My husband had orange chicken and I had kung pow chicken, both were good. Comes with rice and a couple sides too! I would come back."}
{"text":"Love this Chinese. Kung Pao Delight is best I've ever had. Like the orange chicken and chicken lo mein. Have only had takeout, so unsure of service. Not so thrilled with their egg rolls or crab rangoons though, but regular food is what matters. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! We always get delivery and drivers are nice. Food is always great. Especially like the Mongolian beef. This is our go to spot for Chinese when we are in the mood."}
{"text":"Love this place. Try the gang pang chicken and general chicken. They are very friendly and have great customer service. I think everyone in Gilbert should try this place."}
{"text":"I came her me to eat with a friend a while back, and she found a short black hair in her food. After reading reviews I can see this isn't an usual thing for this place. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you if the food is any good or not- Just called to place an order for delivery and the person who answered was incredibly rude! She said they couldn't deliver for an hour and a half, I said that's fine, could I just place my order now.  She said \"no, you give me your number, I call back in an hour and a half.\" I said, \"I can't leave my order with you?\" She yelled at me, and said \"no! I have other customer on the phone.\"
Apparently, they don't need curtesy or customers, so probably won't call them again."}
{"text":"If you haven't been exposed to good Chinese food, then you might be happy with this place.however if you have tasted or eaten somewhat good Chinese food, don't come here. Egg Roll was not made here. Shrimp and lobster sauce was tasteless. Triple something was filled with only onions and a few bites of protein. Yes, it's reasonable, but that doesn't mean much if it lacks any sort of flavor. We definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"This place is local, clean, well priced and the food is terrific! The service was stellar and the atmosphere was OK - not fancy but decent. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Do you ever just crave really good, solid comfort food? For me, it's always hot and sour soup and crab puffs. And lucky for me J&K Gourmet is 3 minutes from my house. Now, if it hadn't taken me three swings around the parking lot to notice them right in front of my face, I would have gotten the food even sooner, but thankfully I took off my sunglasses as found them. 

After a stressful week, I stopped in for some food - ordered 'to go' and was in and out the door within 15 minutes. The place was probably 1/2 full at 5:50 PM with diners and others came and went for take out. 

The food was absolutely delicious, well priced and I am grateful I now have a go-to Chinese restaurant so close to the house. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Honestly a really good restaurant with nice staff and great food. The portions are a little big, but that's a minimal flaw. I always get the vegetable lo mein and am never disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food we have found in the Chandler/Gilbert area. This place is a little drive for us but we make the trip. Much larger portions compared to PF Changs. Better value also. I'm not sure it is \"gourmet\" , mainly standard chinese-american dishes. They do have some good stuff though. Fairly large menu.
We like the egg rolls but not the spring rolls. Good orange chicken, mongolian beef and cashew chicken. 
Usually pick up for take out and they are quick and food is hot.
Definitely worth a visit. Order the \"Crispy Spinach\" . It's not on the menu but they will make it - delicious!!"}
{"text":"A review by a foodie with excellent taste.  I have been eating here forfour years, and love everything about this place! They have the best lemon chick, sweet ands sour, and if you're a fried rice snob like me and my wife, this place will make you feel like you have found china town of LA in Gilbert AZ! I have not found an item that was not a five star experience. I must not neglect the hot and sour soup if you are a fan best in town without a doubt! 

The food is exceptional and the service is nothing less than equal. Try JK you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars because for months, since we moved to Gilbert, we have ordered from them a lot. And the food is wonderful and the owner (husband) who drops the food off is always so kind and nice... 

THE WOMAN ON THE PHONE DOES HAVE AN ACCENT BUT OTHER CHINESE PLACES WITH ACCENTS SOUND NICER THEN HER.. 100% nicer!

HOWEVER, the husband's wife (woman who answers the phone) needs Customer Service 101. Seriously, she needs to know how to speak nicely and friendly to customers.

We called to order our usual which usually is a good $40-$60 order and we always tip the driver well too. I called, placed my order, then I asked her what the total was just to make sure and she was silent for a good minute...
Her: HELLO!!!! ARE YOU THERE OR NOT? ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER OR NOT?
Me: I am sorry. I was waiting for the total. 
Her: UGH! Hold on. Ok, $42.30... 4,3,2,0! Now! What's your credit card number???? Are you going to give it to me or not? I have other customer on the phone!
Me: yes, I have it and I'll give it to you but please don't be so rude next time.
Her: ok it'll be 40-50 min bye (hangs up)

Then my husband called her cuz he could hear her yelling over my phone when it was on my ear. He called and she even got more mad and was screaming at him when he told her that her customer service was bad and he never wants to hear someone yell at his wife like she did again. And that we always order from them and this is not the kind of respect that we are getting.

She got more mad and wanted to start a fight with him and told him to hang the phone up because she has other customers. My husband just told her to hang up and she hung up. 

She never confirmed that our order was canceled so I called again and asked her to make sure it was canceled and she told me, \" yes of course it is you have one angry husband! \" I told her she needs to not be rude to anyone and be more polite especially in the field she is in. I also told her that I will post about her business on yelp and any other site so people are aware. She said \"go ahead I don't care you do that!\" And then she hung up on me. . .

We ended up going to Chinese Great Wall of China, it was awesome and really good. Highly recommend to go there. The people were very nice just like their reviews said! I was reading more reviews down a bit on for JK and there was another complaint about this woman's customer service. They won't stay in business long if they have someone like this. I'm taking this to the BBB too. This is too ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout on our way home from golf which made the car smell delicious! 

Fresh & flavorful dinner and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Chinese restaurants before but sadly this is not one of the better ones IMO. I ordered the chicken broccoli lunch special which was really average at best. The main issue I had was that the broccoli was extremely mushy, to the point where I couldn't finish it. Everything else about the meal was mostly okay but not great. Some of the sides were decent like the salad and the crab puffs/egg roll.

There must not be that many Chinese restaurants at least in this part of Gilbert, while I was not expecting much to start with this was definitely worse than I had expected. I know that they have a lot of offerings on their menu but after this experience I will probably not come back again. Which is a shame because I do like Chinese food..."}
{"text":"I love J+K.  Meal sizes are for big eaters like myself. If you dine in, be sure you get sizzling rice soup. I like the honey chicken. Price is right, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  I came here for lunch a few times and they have great lunch special for $6 - 8 and it always taste delicious. They even have a few noodle speciality I love their beef chow fun."}
{"text":"First time order and this place nailed it! Thank you! We were able to entertain our guests and they all complimented how good the food was!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Went for moo shoo chicken. The portion was small, so I didn't need the 4 pancakes. They used something like beans sprouts rather than cabbage, etc for the veggies, weird. The chicken was little tiny chips of chicken. Other things on the menu may b great, but my meal was lousy and my first time experience will be my last"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food is authentic chinese. So you wont find a buffet line or premade meals in a package.

 Only places Ive ever had authentic chinese food was Vancouver BC, Seattle and San Francisco. I can now add Gilbert, AZ to the list.

If you never had authenic chinese, this is the place to go. Or if you dont know if you ever had authentic chinese food, go here. You will know the difference.

I find that most Chinese places in US dumb down the their food by adding a bunch of sauce to the point where all dishes taste the same.

Restaurant and restrooms are very clean. 

I had chicken with mixed vegetables, lemon chicken, chicken fried rice , white rice, wonton soup with chicken and vegetables. 

Food was flavored just right. They didnt try to hide the taste by pouring a bunch soy sauce over it. You can actually taste the food, imagine that.

 Although I prefer the lemon chicken prepared different, it was still very good. I had the sauce to the lemon chicken on the side.

After visiting different Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area. This is the best."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast and then living in San Francisco for some time, I have had some awesome Chinese food. I will have to say this is the best Chinese food I have had in the valley. You can't beat the price on those lunch box."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Gilbert by far! It's pretty authentic. We have been going there since they opened. We've ordered the salt and pepper pork chop (my favorite), chicken fried rice, salty fish fried rice, hong kong sizzling steak, salt and pepper crispy bean curd, bok choy with garlic sauce to name some and they are all delicious. I sometimes order the mango chicken (instead of shrimp) and they are very accommodating with change requests. I've ordered over the phone as well and the food is always ready by the time I get there. I like that they give free wonton chips while waiting for our food. It keeps my boys occupied. Portions are hearty. I also like that they are open on holidays!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Chinese restaurant with large tasty portions. Not PF Changs nice nor PFCs version of Chinese food. I mention this because my husband loves PF Changs and now expects all Chinese restaurants to be like them. It's not, nor is it meant to be. 

Now that that's out of the way, service was helpful and friendly. Portions were ample, veggies freshly cooked to order. I was very happy to be able to get brown rice (it may have cost $1 more but I honestly don't remember). Everything is made fresh so you can customize the food, which I appreciate. Meat wasn't fatty or grisly like I've experienced at other Chinese restaurants. All in all, a good meal. 

I enjoyed it and will come back but probably not with my husband lol."}
{"text":"This was a great find down here in Gilbert. I have been looking for great (not just good) Chinese food in the area for about 2 months now and thanks to my loyal Yelp reviewers and their photos of the food served I took their advice and found a treasure.

We arrived for a late lunch 9wife and I0 to a wait and no one but the waitress to clean the tables. then after sitting down it too much too long to get asked what to drink and then while waiting much too long for the drinks we then waited to order our food!

I had Hot and Sour Soup for starters which was awesome! then with the main course I have rice, small salad (very small, almost a garnish along with the mouth full of fried -won-tons)  deep fried egg roll and something called \"pang gang beef\" or ??? anyways, it's breaded beef strips with a very dark rich sauce that included Jalapenos and was supposed to have onions but I think the cook spaced on those and left them out.

In spite of the misgivings of the slow service, missed food ingredient and dirty tasting hot tea, I would still go back. The flavor, temperature and preparation of the food was simply fantastic.

My wife and I both enjoyed our lunch dishes and would go back and try other menu items without hesitation.

Just stay away from the hot tea and be ready to wait..."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with how I was just treated by the employees. I have been ordering from them for almost a year and never had a problem until now. Will not be going back after how I was just yelled at over the phone."}
{"text":"I come here often but this time I came with my whole family and it was just terrible we asked for no egg on the fried rice and they added egg and the Service was just as bad the lady was really mean and still charged 15% tip (???) and there was flys flying around and I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a closer Chinese place to the house for awhile now. I normally go to King Wok because it's the closest NY Style Chinese food I could find in Gilbert. So I tried this place out.

The service was awesome, fast, and friendly. I saw all the bad reviews about call-ins, but they treated me great for just walking in, and they even offered me a soda while waiting. 

The wait wasn't long at all, maybe 10 minutes. 

The food is great, fresh and tasty! 

-1 star because I love steamed dumplings, and they were great, but King Wok uses a sweet dipping sauce(just like how it is back east), and JKs was basically soy sauce."}
{"text":"Quick delivery! We got the orange chicken and honey chicken and they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite local Chinese place. The food is fantastic and I love that they deliver. The orange chicken is fantastic."}
{"text":"Prices are status quo for any strip mall Chinese joint, the difference is that it's clean and you can actually sit down and enjoy your meal at a table versus plastic lawn furniture.  

Not that I'm too good for that, but I'm just sayin' there are *those* places....which deliver.

I've dined in here and ordered take out.  (Curry chicken first go around and garlic chicken as take out.)  I found both to be good, but not nearly as flavorful as I would have liked.  Next time I'll probably order them spicy and then revise my review.

Side note about take out:  I ordered it to be ready for pick up after a massage, which ran over.  The server looked at the time on my receipt, then looked at his watch, then scowled, which I found amusing.  

I have no complaints nor do I have raves so perhaps I'll say this about my neighborhood Chinese joint:  it's the missionary position of all mom and pop asian restaurants, which is appropriate considering it's in Gilbert. 

So...check it out...it'll get the job done. ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast and i love chinese food!! i looked at the reviews and i figured i try this out since there were a lot of positive feed back!! i wish i never came here the food was horrible had no taste. I'm sorry for people that are born and raised in Arizona they don't know what good Chinese food is. I ordered egg drop soup and it had corn in it i never in my life seen corn in egg drop soup it just went down hill from there needs more flavor.I won't be going back sorry"}
{"text":"Had lunch there with my family one hour later. I was deathly sick with food poisoning. NEVER EAT at this place."}
{"text":"Checked out this place last Saturday with the family and it was goooooood! We were shocked at the portions, but it's okay because the leftovers were even better the next day. We ordered garlic chicken, orange chicken, lo mein, etc. All were excellent. I'm a huge fan of their garlic chicken and will need to go back soon because even as I write this I'm craving it. 
A nice touch is that the combo meals are served in a bento box type try. Love this because I hate my food touching."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and comes in good portions for cheap prices. It's the first good Chinese food I've found since moving to AZ. There dinner combos come with soup, meat of choice, rice, a huge egg roll, and 2 cream cheese wontons for 10 bucks. I will say, the service is not the best, they try to be nice but rush you through everything and the whole family just hangs out in the dining area as you're eating. kinda weird, but the food is great"}
{"text":"Great for take out. Decently priced and pretty tasty. They are very quick also. I usually place my order over the phone and when I arrive 10 minutes later it is already packed up and ready for pick up. 

I highly recommend any of their salt & pepper entrees, particularly the squid. They make a really good version of it."}
{"text":"I told my husband every couple needs a Chinese restaurant they always go to. 

One day, he said we should try this place because they had lots of great Google reviews. Lo and behold! This place is FANTASTIC!!

Our favorite is their General Tso's chicken. 

I love that they bring out little wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce for dipping. 

Service is friendly, in fact, go there twice and they'll treat you like you are a regular! I love that! 

Their meals are cheap and large. What not to love??!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Just moved to the area and have already ordered delivery 3 times. Each time the food was delivered super quick and was delicious. Have not had a bad dish, everyone in the family has been thoroughly impressed with every dinner."}
{"text":"We tried this place as a recommendation from a co-worker.  We dined in the resturant once, and have done take out a few times since then.  All were enjoyable experiences with super friendly and attentive staff.   The potstickers here are the best I've had!     We've also tried the Garlic Chicken (yummy, would definately order again)   Crispy Beef (good, but too much batter for my tastes, prob wouldn't order again)  Cashew Pork (very tasty, my husband really enjoyed this dish)  We've also tried the mongolian beef which is a bit spicy and the chicken fried rice which was super good, though I think it's probably difficult to mess up fried rice.     I left off the 5th star because I'm picky and would like more description on the menu itself.  I have found that many chinese resturants have different ideas how popular dishes are prepared, sometimes it's breaded, somtimes it's not, etc.   Bottom line, this will be a regular for us!    Now i'm hungry, I'll think I need chinese for dinner..."}
{"text":"These guys deliver but apparently not too far. Can't manage to Higley/ Chandler Heights."}
{"text":"Not happy with dinner at all!  Egg drop soup was super thick like gravy.  Chips are stale.  Rice was hard, like it's been sitting awhile.  Main entree was bad.  Service was horrible.  Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST Chinese food in the east valley! Awesome lunch special with huge portions and great price. Quick and friendly service. Try the sesame chicken or the triple delicacy! Egg drop soup is sooooo tasty! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"So absolutely rude. And won't budge on substitutions. Also no freaking kids menu. My husband has a need for authentic Chinese food and we get stuck going here when it's his turn to pick the place. And it sucks for the rest of us because the choices are limited and they won't budge on the menu or the portions. Irritating."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located right by my house. We have been going here for over a year now... And we LOVE it. The food is so delicious and reasonably priced. You get a lot for your money. My husband and I always order the gang pang chicken (extra spicy) and share it. I believe you get fried wong tongs before the main dish for free.. free rice...and free fortune cookies. We can eat dinner for under 12 bucks including tip. The service is extremely fast & the employees are very welcoming & friendly. Literally my all time favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's my go to place for chinese food that closest to my house. I usually always just order for take-out, so i couldn't give it a review for the service. But when i go to pick up my order. The people eating seem to be doing well. 

It's a typical asian place, where you see the family kids there. Food is awesome."}
{"text":"Horribly rude! Walked in with a party of 7 and waited to be sat and asked if we could sit and they looked at us with no response. . We began to clear a table of dish rags to sitting on the only large table they had to accommodate and no service. I told my family to get up because we were obviously not welcome for whatever reason. . They only a 1 table eating and it was empty so you would think they would want the business.  I said thanks for being so rude and no service and the 2 women in front refused to even look up when their other customers witnesses the whole thing. . I wish bad on Noone but I will be glad to see this business fail. . Good ridens!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to place for my chicken lo-mein. Although it doesn't come in a traditional Chinese takeout box, it is the epitome of good take out.

I'll admit that I've stuck to this one dish, but I'm just so satisfied. I don't get the combo (where you can get rice and an egg roll), rather i just get the lo-mein dish, and it feeds me for two meals!  

They are super fast, and alway ready once i walk in the door. Don't first to ask for chopsticks as they won't automatically put it in your bag."}
{"text":"my FAVORITE place to eat! they always make sure to greet you as you walk in and seat you quickly. it's a smaller, intimate restaurant and the waiters/waitresses really are quick and always make sure you have what you need. next, their food is to die for. I crave it! their egg drop soup is the best I've ever tasted! I get their mouth watering orange chicken though and it's delicious! their egg rolls rock, as well as the salad. and all of this for $7 during their lunch special hours! this place really can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Not so much a review because after 15 minutes and never getting talked to, getting menus ourselves and watching other people get their own water, we decided to go some place else. We ended up going to great wall just down the street. Which has great service and great food!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery which took exactly 40 minutes. Ok because we were told that when ordering. The lady was pleasant. Unfortunately the food not-so-much. The protein in both our meals were extremely dry and and bland. It would've been nice to have had some utensils, maybe some napkins. 
Next time,  we'll just drive to Simi's Café on Baseline for awesome asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Manager lady is brusque and annoying. Wait staff seems friendly and eager. Wide selection of dishes, plus daily specials.  We ordered the \"gang pang\" chicken (seriously...that's the name... ;-), and the szechuan chicken.  Both were listed with the red chile warning icon (spicy!!).  But neither was spicy.  Or at least not much.  And the flavor was OK...not great...just OK.

If you're looking for some fast Chinese take-out, this is adequate I guess.  Nothing special.  Dining in you just get to pay for drinks and a tip, so why bother?  There's a place on Alma School at Elliot that's better (China Way) if you want Chinese food.

If we eat here again (unlikely), I'll update this with opinions about whatever we order (won't be szechuan or gang pang!).  Maybe some of their other dishes are better."}
{"text":"Just a quick rundown I ordered some food they said it would be 45 minutes. Right at the 45 minute mark I get a call from the delivery person telling me that the kitchen got a little backed up and he was on his way and would see me in 10 minutes. What more could you ask for, and then all the times that I've ordered delivery I've never gotten a phone call from the driver saying that they were on their way with an apology. For that customer service alone I give this company five stars. Not to mention the food is always good"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night for the first time. I have been in the shopping center many times, for Kohl's and Sprouts, but never noticed J & K before. I was looking for Chinese food here on Yelp! and saw this one had good ratings, so I decided to try it. I will return again. I went alone, so I had the 'Specialties for 1' orange chicken, which comes with choice of soup, I had egg drop, egg roll, 2 wontons, greens and white rice. Everything was well prepared, hot (temp), and delicious. The place was packed, and service was still good. I did not experience any rude Asian women while there."}
{"text":"Honest to God. We come here on Christmas Day ever year. Family tradition, If you are in the mood for a feast. J and K is the place! Nice for a big group. Massive round table encourages conversation and fun! Service is great. Food is pretty good-a little overly battered at times."}
{"text":"This place is great! We just moved here and having a good Chinese restaurant close by is a must. We ate at the restaurant and were happy, and were even happier with their delivery. They always come sooner than they say, food is hot and order correct. Plus they are overall just nice people!"}
{"text":"Take out on a Friday night, easy phone in order. Estimated Delivery time was 45 minutes, arrived in 25! Absolutely delicious. Recommend the seafood fried rice and cashew chicken. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Once you find a goof Chinese restaurant you'll never forget it. This is one restaurant that I'll drive to if I'm in Chandler or even San Tan. Their Lo Mein and fried rice has just the right amount of flavor with not a lot of filler vegetables. They give ample amounts of meat. Their chicken is all white chicken breast and it's good. 
I also always get excellent customer service. Thank J & K Gourmet for not letting waste my good hard earned money on your food. Food that keeps me coming back.
Period."}
{"text":"Now this place has some AWESOME Chinese food. The chicken - you and can tell it's real chicken! The sauces are terrific! The hot and sour soup is great. Sometimes I wish it came out just a little hotter (temperature) but it's always great. My wife and I always split the lunch for one but it's more then enough food for two average eaters. We don't like over fill ourselves. 
The must put some nutmeg or cinnamon in the egg rolls. It was an odd change at first but now it is terrific. I dream about eating these egg rolls!
Occasionally I will get the shrimp lo-mein. I always ask for it extra extra extra spicy but it always seems to come out the same spicy level. So if you like things hot, make sure really emphasis SPICY. 
The waitressing staff is also exceptional! They have come to know us so well we walk in, sit down, and they know we are ready to order. Don't waist any time and let's eat!

Don't wait any longer! Go eat some good Chinese food at this place. They need to make multiple locations of this place!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Best fried rice and lo mein! Fast service and their Beijing pork chop is so good!"}
{"text":"JK is awesome! We were hesitant at first to try this place cause I never looked busy but we are glad we did. JK is not as greasy as your typical chinese joint. This place is very affordable, the wait staff is very attentive and nice. I always get the lemon chicken as my entree. If you order a dinner combo it comes in a crazy rectangular box-plate type deal with your entree, rice, a little salad and crab puffs and a sweet and sour sauce and a spicy mustard in their own little compartments. Its pretty cool. This is by no means gourmet and is pretty much americanized but yummy none the less."}
{"text":"Everytime I have been here I have never been disappointed with the food. They are very quick and the food is always above and beyond most Chinese restaurants I've been to. I have recommended this place to several people and they have all told me how much they like it too. This restaurant is a gem."}
{"text":"J & K Gourmet is the best quality Chinese food lunch special in the valley. I pay just as much as I would for Panda Express and get double the portion sizes and food to fill me up! $15 for two people is not a bad deal and there is a huge selection for lunch. Give them a try, it won't hurt the wallet and it is so worth it! Try the Kung Pao chicken it's really flavorful."}
{"text":"Is Gilbert lacking Chinese restaurants!?  This place was hopping during my visit.  If you're craving some Chinese this place is quick and pretty good.  It's a hit and miss -- order correctly and you win!  I'd like to buy a vowel or some Beef Chow Fun :)  Chow Fun was kinda dry; Sizzling Beef was like eating ketchup!  I'd recommend the Spicy Fish Fry, Asparagus, and Orange Chicken -- don't forget your fried rice either!  Service? Well it was great if you want things done and you service speedy, but (haha) don't expect a smile.  The restaurant itself was pretty lacking of decors, but they did what they could. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was another recommendation from a friend & we were happy we gave it a try. The portions are good & the lunch special is a great deal. The salad dressing was my husband's favorite part. I was happy to hear that you can order orange chicken \"naked\" (without the breading) because I am not a fan of breading. The service is good & we look forward to going again in the future."}
{"text":"Love their house fried rice. I get it all the time. Their orange chicken...I don't think I care for it too much. I'm picky about orange chicken every since I been eating panda expresses orange chicken. But once again. I LOVE their house fried rice. Their good on time too. Very quick."}
{"text":"Assuming you can communicate your order by phone, it will be ready for pick up in 10 minutes. Tastes great when you feel like Chinese food in generous portions."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here almost weekly for years! Even after moving farther away, we choose to drive here over any closer Chinese restaurants. The portions are huge and the dinner combos come with lots of sides. I recommend the garlic chicken or lo mein!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  I love their soup.  The egg foo yung patties are terrible.  But they do have great sauce and fresh veggies.  The staff is nice.  I am just not blown away by the food."}
{"text":"My wife is Chinese and we are used to dining at Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles Chinatown and in the San Gabriel Valley in California (she is very picky).  We don't care for the \"Americanized\" Chinese food served in many restaurants.  With that said, we LOVE this place and we never had a bad meal there.  It's a close drive from our home too, so take out is a great option for us too.  It's near Sprouts too."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Gilbert BY FAR! Thank you j&k for the great and food! Love dine-in and take out! So exited we found this place!"}
{"text":"Everywhere we went was packed with a 30 minute wait time on a Friday night and then we spotted this place ... what? no wait ... hmmmm???  what could this mean. We gave it a try and I think we found a hidden gem.  The dishes were original and some were spicy.  Felt like a mom and pop operation, very nice.  I would highly recommend it.  The egg drop soup was delicious with a surprise inside, they put fresh corn in their soup, different but good!  I can't say enough.  If you like good old fashioned Americanized Chinese food with a little twist, this is it!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, some of the best Chinese I've had in AZ.  I'm no Chinese food expert, but everything I have ordered has been delicious.  I do wish they had a better kids menu.  Also, they seem to use one of their booths as a storage area at times which looks unprofessional.  I normally order takeout so I'm not too concerned with the look of their dining room.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time.  Ordered here because we just moved to the area and it was convenient.  The  fresh ingredients made this a real treat and this is definitely our \"go to\" Chinese restaurant  from now on!"}
{"text":"First time I ordered here was take out and got pan fried noodles, salt pepper squid and salted fish/chicken fried rice. VERY GOOD! 2nd time I ordered thru Door Dash and got salt and pepper pork, and Chinese sausage fried rice. I can eat here everyday! I've been looking for amazing pan fried noodles and fried rice ever since Yangtse Bistro in Chandler closed down, and I have found it!"}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive New York style Chinese food.  Large portions, and high quality food!  They are also very friendly and quick!  We really enjoy their Beef and Broccoli, as well as their Beef Chow Fun."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I always come and get the Shrimp Chow Fun and it's delicious every single time. I love how close it is to my house too. The servers are really friendly as well. Portion size is really good, I always get left overs taken home. Price-wise isn't too bad either. I always come here with my boyfriend, and for 2 people, with drinks, one appetizer, and 2 entrees bill comes up to about 25 dollars. I don't think that's too shabby. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I'm telling you this place is fabulous!  Quick delivery and our awesome delivery driver called to confirm our address!  Food is very very good and ALWAYS arrives hot!  Do yourself a favor and try this restaurant!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant that I've ever been to. I always order the same thing, so I'm not getting a huge variety from their menu, but why mess with delicious perfection. I rarely eat in the restaurant now because pick up- to go orders are so convenient. Their Sizzling Rice Soup is absolutely delicious. This is what I usually order. We also love their crab puffs. My favorite chicken entree is Honey Chicken. Highly recommend these dishes and this restaurant. The food is great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We ordered delivery on New Years Eve and everything was great! The delivery driver took my order over the phone and was extremely helpful and made some great recommendations for dinner. He was also super patient as my child was being extremely loud in the background. I asked if he would have change for a large bill and he said he would. He called me on his over to our house so we know our food would be there soon. When he got to the door, he had already gotten change for my large bill ready. I was super impressed with his service. The food was amazing too! We loved the crab puffs and the chicken and broccoli. We absolutely plan on eating here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing value, I had lunch today. Sesame chicken combo with friend rice, egg roll, salad and egg flour soup for $7.50! Amazing deal and the food was good quality. Not the best I've had but best for the value for sure!! I would go back!"}
{"text":"I like J&K.  Not everything on the menu is good, but there are a few things I keep going back for pretty regularly, namely the Gang Pang Chicken and Lo Mein.  It's not gourmet as purported in their name, but they are consistent in their preparation and the ingredients always taste fresh.

If you're looking for real Chinese food, this is not the place, it's Americanized.  If you want dim sum, you'll need to go elsewhere.  I've tried a few other Chinese places around Gilbert and this is the best I've found."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Thought it would be bigger inside but it was pretty small, but that was ok. The food was so good! You'll always end up getting way too much but if you take it home with you it's just as good later too!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Valley for over 15 yrs and I have finally found my favorite Chinese restaurant.  The owners are very attentive to making you feel at home and the value is amazing.  The sizzling soup is amazing and always fresh.  The egg foo young is delicious and we have yet to find any complaints.  We have gone as a family and as a large group and everytime, it has been a great experience."}
{"text":"The food is legit.  Probably the best non chain Chinese restaurant in Gilbert. Garlic green beans are great. Service is good but is real laid back."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had in AZ!  I am from NY and this is like NY Chinese.  Very fast service also!"}
{"text":"It was totally empty when we walked in and empty when we left on a Saturday night, not a good sign.   It was ok, not great, but ok for the quick Asian fix. I am looking for a Chinese place that will remind me of back home sweet Chicago. Also want one that will deliver to the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food I've had here in Arizona. The food is flavorful and the portions are big! Think lunch prices and dinner portions!  I live pretty close to here and we order here more often than I'd care to admit. You must try the Mongolian Chicken dish there! You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Been eating at this place since it opened. Is it as good as Wong's in Mesa when they are firing on all cylinders? No, but it's really good for Gilbert Arizona Chinese food. It's not like we are in New York or San Francisco."}
{"text":"I came here to pick up some take out for my family. I ordered at the counter and was told it would be 5-10 minutes. The staff was in no way friendly and seemed put out by our presence. We got our food about 30 minutes later and came straight home.

We got house fried rice, house lo mein, house beef and broccoli, and house lemon chicken. The fried rice and lo mein were so bland and greasy that they were pretty much inedible. The beef and broccoli had decent flavor, but again was greasy and the broccoli was so overcooked that it was mushy. The lemon chicken was just kind of weird. They packaged the sauce separately, but was coagulated by the time we got home and wouldn't really pour because it was so thick. The flavor was ok, but not what I would call good. 

There's no way we will come back here. I have no idea how it got the ratings it has right now with the food being so bad. It blows my mind. Skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food in my opinion. I love Chinese food, it seriously might be my favorite and this is my go to whenever I'm really feening some takeout!"}
{"text":"I went here this evening with my family.  Service was much better when my mom was around when it was just my husband and I.  We ordered a lot and the food was good, but we were basically the only Asian people other than the restaurant's staff.  So, you know this place caters more to the non-Chinese population.  

Some of the normal dishes we got, like the Beef Chow Fun, it was okay, but definitely not make more like the way Cantonese like it.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp was also not to how I like it, but the West Lake Soup was really good and very meaty.  Yum.

My favorite dish was the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops were perfect for me.  The Honk Kong Sizzling Beef was good, too.  The Kung Pao Chicken was fine, as with the Spicy Fish Fillet.  

I'm thinking if I went in without my mom, we might not have gotten quite as good service, but not sure.  Maybe it was a sense of not good communication.  I was speaking Cantonese to the waiter, but didn't realize he spoke Mandarin, not Cantonese.  The menu was a Cantonese menu, so my bad for assuming that he would know Cantonese.

So, if you don't know what more authentic Cantonese food, this food is fine.  The portions are good, and colorful, too.  And, it's not bad.  It is a Chinese owner and cook.  And it's close to home, within a few miles.  

Oh, and we also had potstickers.  These were fine, though, the skin was a little on the thick side.  

It was good that they had pics of some of the foods on their menu.  

I definitely think service is different if you're \"white\" or if you're Chinese or if you know the owner or not."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is the best in town!   They don't over cook their meat and make their food mushy like most Chinese restaurants in town.  You can taste the quality.  The crab wontons are the best here!"}
{"text":"Orgasmic GOOD! So delicious and perfect! Blew me away! Best Chinese food I have ever had in my LIFE!! And Chinese is my favorite. 25 years and I will always come back here it's that good! I love the options they have so you don't have to get something just so you can get what you want or order to much to make everyone happy, they have lunch and dinner combinations for each person with all the stuff you would ask for. Seriously so good I can't wait to eat my left overs. THEY GIVE YOU SO MUCH FOOD TO! And the salad dressing is a hit! You won't find that taste anywhere. Amazing. And the wonton chips before ! And the THAI TEA! Seriously I don't get it everything was amazing. My bf got full right away and was so mad cuz he wanted to keep eating he couldn't breath lol. GREAT CHOICE !!!!!"}
{"text":"Well We finally tried this place after passing it for 6 years !  Wish we would of still kept walking.  The Staff was very unfriendly, constantly walked past but never really did or said ANYTHING.  Every single thing had a upcharge to it.  The egg drop soup was more like corn chowder (can't have corn) and I was only given 1 other choice on the combo.  Or I had to pay extra for won ton soup.  If you don't like white rice w/your meal be prepared to have a $2 charge for fried rice.  I thought they were going to charge when we asked for a knife.

The won tons served w/sweet and sour for (I guess appetizer) was stale, just as the fortune cookie was.  The meal itself was OK but atmosphere and staff truly lacking in ALL categories.

Going back to OUR FAVORITE PLACE \"GREAT WALL\"
If you must eat in this area or chinese because you don't want to go anywhere else, be prepared for a so so experience, don't say I didn't warn you !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonite with another couple and everyone loved what they ordered.  So excited we found this place!!!! Dumplings,  Sesame Chicken, Crab Puffs, Hunan Delight, Chow Phun.....we WILL be back! PS. Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is fantastic Chinese food!  I have live and traveled from coast to coast and have had amazing Chinese in many places. One of my favorite areas for Chinese food is Long Island, NY. The food here is just as good!  Great Kung Pao, Won Ton soup and pork egg rolls.  Take out portions were huge and the price was very reasonable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My kids favorite Chinese food. Great price with large portions. Always have food to take home for another meal. They love the egg drop soup, I prefer the hot and sour. Food is fresh and at lunch you get soup, salad and egg roll or crab puffs. We enjoy the crab puffs. Nice neighborhood play to go and quick service."}
{"text":"We have always tried any Chinese food we can cause the fam loves it!  We have eaten here and gotten take out and to be honest the food keeps getting better!  I don't know if they changed cooks or what, but a couple months ago I would have given 2 stars.  Now, I give a solid 4 and look forward to our next meal!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this Chinese food. They are very quick and give you generous portions of food. The restaurant itself is small with about 15 tables, but it is really busy for takeout. I have never been disappointed with my food here. The staff is friendly and attentive which makes dining out that much easier :). Although this place is really good, I gave it a 4 star rating because it still doesn't beat my favorite Chinese restaurant (Schezuan Garden)."}
{"text":"We love going here for the lunch special, its a great price and alot of food. They are always very friendly to us and even know our drink order before we order our food.i do recommend this place."}
{"text":"We are repeat customers and never had a bad experience yet. Charles and the staff are always hospitable. This time around we ordered the house chow mein, garlic green beans, salt and peppered pork and shrimp fried rice and everything turned out great. 

The only issue is the location. Not exactly down the street, I'd say good 15 min drive. There are others nearby but J&K is well worth the drive as the others don't measure up at all."}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh. Good lunch specials. Every place can be hit or miss, and these guys hit more often than not. Go there, eat an egg roll and be happy. :)"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food ice eaten.
Food was hard and dry. No love or care was put into it at all.

I ordered sweet and sour chicken and got pork. 
The pu pu platter was literally dry

I asked for two bottles of Coke and got regular cup full of mostly ice.

Service? Lady on the phone was rude and the delivery man expected a $20 tip.

Terrible."}
{"text":"Been a customer of this restaurant for the 8 years I have been in Arizona.  They have consistently provided me with very stellar customer service and excellent food.  One of the dishes I prefer eating is the steamed chicken and broccoli (no sauce) and find it quite tasty to the point that it is my \"norm\".  

I also like ordering the Pu Pu Platter, combination fried rice, and egg drop soup."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. One of my best friends lived walking distance from here and we would always get take out and boxed wine and make a night of it. This place is still just as bomb.com. The other day I was having a legit craving for some Chinese food. But I wanted the sit down, sake bomb and egg-drop soup kind of experience. Not that fake and fast panda junk. This place is a little further and out of the way for me these days but we decided to make the drive and it was definitely worth it. I decided to try the Mongolian beef this time around and it did not disappoint. Their combination platters leave me with leftovers too, which doesn't happen very often. LOL. This little joint is clean, cute, the staff is friendly and the food is legitimate. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place has the best shrimp fried rice this aide of the Mississippi . It's conveniently located right off the highway and the staff is always friendly and fast .  The food is top notch and I never need to add anything else for flavoring ..if you are in the area you have to try it out ."}
{"text":"Let's face it all food is subjective.  We like what we like.  Everyone's tastebuds are different.  And Chinese food is one of those things that everyone has an opinion about.  Many here on Yelp abhore the \"chain\" Chinese establishments.  Not just for taste reasons but for other reasons as well.  I prefer the smaller Chinese places over the \"chains\" but I also feel the chains have their place too.  Having said that we were out on a Saturday and I was feeling like Chinese so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app on my phone and found J & K.  We walked in and waited for just a few minutes while a table was cleared. It was a fairly busy Saturday night.  My daughter loves shrimp.  She would eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  She drools at the mere mention of shrimp. We ordered an appitizer of fried shrimp. 6 beautiful, big, butterfly shrimp.  She was in heaven.  As for me, I love to order different dishes and then take the rest home for lunch or dinner for the next few days.  The garlic chicken was yummy!  So tender and lots of flavor.  I had mu shu pork.  It was served already wrapped in the it's wrapper, like little burritos on the plate.  It was probably some of the best mu shu I've had.  I also got some house special fried rice.  Everything was good.  Service was fast and polite.  Our server brought my daughter some extra wonton chips which she loves.  I enjoyed our meal and the leftovers were just as good the next day.  If you're looking for good chinese, tell them I sent you.  Just remember, it is subjective.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We have gotten take-out here a few times and are always super happy with it. We have said it's probably our favorite Chinese food place in the area!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Chinese food in Arizona. I'm so happy we have found this place. Fried rice, delicious. Mongolian beef, delicious. BBQ pork chow mein, delicious. Best orange chicken I've have in a while! This is our Friday night go to favorite. Friendly staff and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  Never been  disappointed..  Until today.  I was served my egg drop soup..  Delicious.  Then came my lunch special.  The general chicken.  So good.....  Until I found a short black hair. I was grossed out.  I started poking around and found more.  We told the waitress who told the manager.  Manager apologized and comped the meal.  Said he employees wear hair nets in the back.  Said it must have been the waitresses.  I don't care who's hair it is...  It shouldn't be in my food.  My sister examined her orange chicken and found fair in there as well. We went to the desk and saw in the back two cooks not wearing hair nets.  Needless to say...  I will never eat at this restaurant again..  Bummed because I could always count on them for good food."}
{"text":"Well I've eaten here 3 times now. It's time to write a review. Last Sunday I wanted Chinese food and J&K says they deliver. I wanted to try a new dish I read a few reviews and suggestions and from other Yelpers. Called them up at 4 PM ordered Salt & Pepper chicken and Gang Pang Beef for delivery. Well the person on the phone says it's a $25 minimum order for delivery and says it will take 45 minutes or more to deliver to my house even though I'm only 3 miles away. I really didn't feel like driving anywhere hence the whole reason for calling the restaurant in the 1st place. The manager states if I pick it up it will be ready in 10 minutes, this seemed reasonable, I agreed. I wait at the house for a few minutes and make 1 stop at CVS before going into J&K about 15 mins later and walk in to the front desk expecting my order to be ready, Nope. They try giving me somebody's else's order I tell them that's not what I ordered they ask for my phone # then tell me it's not ready. So I have to sit and wait another 10 minutes, the place is not busy it's a Sunday afternoon around 4:30. I finally get my order 20 minutes later than originally stated and go home. First off I've never had either entrée before and didn't know what to expect but judging from appearance alone the Gang Pang Beef, it kind of grossed me out and my roommate even commented on the appearance. It seriously looked a bunch of dirty peckers covered in brown sauce. Its heavily breaded beef and suppose to be spicy with 2 peppers indicating so on the menu. Not spicy what so ever and so heavily breaded I wouldn't of known I was eating beef. As far as the Salt & Pepper chicken, all I can say is hold the Salt. That's all I could taste is salt and I know the name has salt in it but that can't be right. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy either entrée and didn't finish them. Like I stated previously this was my 3rd and final visit to J&K. They just don't deliver on taste and quality. I love mom and pop shops and try to support small business but I will no longer go to J&K. Sorry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in the valley! The hot and sour soup is absolutely delicious, the egg rolls were amazing, and we love their orange chicken! To top it off, the staff is very friendly and helpful. We will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"My grandmother was in the mood for egg rolls so we chose this place as she has seen it many times before on her way to Sprouts. They have some pretty good deals and the food is decent. If you are looking for a lot of flavor and WOW, don't expect it, but if you're hungry and want some Chinese food this is your place."}
{"text":"Ordered Chinese over the phone - easy and FAST! Great communicator as well. Egg drop soup was hot, egg rolls were delicious, and they gave us a ton in our entrees (enough for at least 2 meals)! Also gave us steamed rice. Broccoli Beef was awesome and included other veggies which was a nice touch - plenty of meat. The Kung Pow Pork was \"really good,\" says my fiancé! Over the phone he said 40-45 minutes, and it came in 20 MINUTES!!!! So happy because we were so hungry. So pleased with J&K! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. I ordered take out for dinner and got the Mongolian beef extra extra spicy,( I've learned you have to order it like this in Chinese restaurants in order for it to be remotely spicy), shrimp lo mein, and general tso's chicken. The dinner combos around $8 and you get soup, an eggroll, a few crab rangoons, and fried rice. Pretty good deal!  I didn't like the general tso's chicken. The batter was way to thick. BUT the rest of the food was pretty good and my mongolian beef was actually spicy. I took a take out menu when I left and noticed their lunch combos are only $5 and you get the same thing as the dinner combos! I will definitely return for a lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Always good service. Always good food. The prices have not changed since I started coming here 6 years ago. LOVE their fried rice and sweet and sour pork or chicken."}
{"text":"Best eggdrop soup I've had.   Everything was very fresh and had great flavor.   The fact they  deliver sealed the deal."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty!  I would say it was my favorite WonTon soup ever!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I travel the US quite a bit. I always use Yelp to search for the best Chinese food. This place was closest to the hotel so I gave it a shot. Glad I did. I always order the same dish, Happy Family. It is veggies and every meat you can think of. Chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops etc.... I ordered it to go. It was done in less than 7 minutes and was piping hot. A short 1.5 mile trip back to the Doubletree and I was ready for dinner. Very good. Veggies still crisp, not mushy. I also gauge the quality by the oil content. Not oily at all. I was satisfied with the quality, taste and value. I will return!"}
{"text":"This is my to go to Chinese restaurant here in Gilbert area. I have been coming here for years ever since I moved here of 2011. My fave dishes from them is the Lo Mein and salt/pepper shrimp. I love that they dont use msg in their dishes and they use low cholesterol oil to cook their food. The flavors in their dishes are so delish and portions are pretty decent size. I never get tired of going here everytime I crave Chinese. The people are also friendly so thats a plus. Its a small place but they tend to get pretty busy with their regulars. A must try if youre nearby!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. It's one of our stand-bys for when we don't feel like cooking. From the time we order to the time the food is done is usually about 10 mins. The food is consistently ok, never bad, but nothing to be excited about. We order the lemon chicken for the kids, because they don't like anything spicy. Food for four people usually lasts about 1 1/2 meals for us and costs around $40 for a couple of chicken and rice dishes and some potstickers/crab puffs."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my visit here. I called in around 730 pm to pick up. It took only ten minutes for my entire order (fried rice, shrimp lo mein, and orange chicken). I got in and out of the establishment within 5 minutes. While the food was fantastic I might also add that the portion sizes were huge. Will definitely be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Try somewhere else. I normally enjoy supporting family owned/ran businesses, so it is unfortunate I have to write this. My family have been going here for years and it has gotten worse at each visit. Two recent visits, the most recent was dine in and the service was horrible. Worse than when we called our order and picked up the food. So, if you want to be treated like they are doing you a favor by cooking an over priced meal then by all means, head over to J&K Gourmet on 2540 S Val Vista Rd in Gilbert AZ! They will provide poor service and act as if their job is to socialize with each other at the counter and if something was made wrong or is horrible they will make sure to act as if it was your mistake and look at you like you're an idiot. And to get a refill even on water, well you should just bring your own drinks since they will only be at your table four times. 1) to seat you; 2) take your order; 3) bring your food and 4) bring the bill. Anyway, you more than like will see a young girl who thinks she is one of your own teenage kids with the attitudes she gives. Good luck and with all the other Chinese food places around, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here last night - orange chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice and crab wontons. The rice, orange chicken and Mongolian beef were to die for but the crab rangoons were nothing special. Food was ready and piping hot when I picked it up about 15 minutes after ordering over the phone. Staff was very friendly. Although I didn't dine in, the atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant and clean. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken last week. The Mongolian Beef was pretty good, but their Sweet and Sour was just nasty! The breading tasted like old fryer oil from the 60's..EW!  

I picked up this food because I was in the area, but live in the West Valley, so when I called to tell them about their chicken, she said I had to drive back over there, which is an hr drive and return the food in order for them to do anything about it. I told the manager my situation and she did not care, not even to lose my business. She quote on quote said to me, \"too bad for you\" LOL w/e

I had to throw practically all of the order of Sweet and Sour away. You won't be getting my business anymore!"}
{"text":"Always great service, consistent quality and delicious!!! We always order take out from J&K even though it is 15 minutes away from our house. Kung Pao Beef and Hunan Beef were so yummy and spicy my husband and I needed two beers each to cool our mouths down. The servings are so large you have an amazing lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food we've had in Arizona. Not too greasy or fake tasting. Very balanced. Good portions. House fried rice and teriyaki chicken were very good. Will be coming back to try rest of menu."}
{"text":"This place gives you a lot of food for your money. Good food too. Love the honey chicken and delivery is always faster than what they quote you!"}
{"text":"I love good Chinese food, and this place is my favorite for it in the valley. Whenever I'm down in the area, I try to swing by and get some. The place is always just about full, which, in my experience, is rare for a Chinese food restaurant. If you're in the area, you should definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"For some reason I was craving and in search for fried pork. Who hasn't had that craving before, right? I was lucky to come across J&K and saw a picture that someone posted of their salt and pepper pork. I immediately headed there for lunch and ordered it...wish it was part of their lunch special but oh well. They have a huge menu and there were so many tempting things but I just had have some fried pork. It was exactly what I was looking for and did not disappoint. It had the right amount of saltiness and the sauteed jalapeno slices, onions and bell peppers were the perfect accompaniment. I can't wait to bring the rest of my family so I can try what they order and get the salt & pepper pork again."}
{"text":"I love their food. I've never had a bad dish! Great service and super fast with take out! Great place to indulge!"}
{"text":"We went to this place because several mentioned it was the best place in this area. I don't know where they have eaten but this was absolutely the worse place we have eaten. My husband and I had the combo plate with wontons, egg roll, soup, etc. I had Mongolian Beef and the only thing good was the sauce. It is usually made with green onions but they had mostly white onions and I picked out, at least, 1 1/4 cups of them. I don't really know what the \"beef\"was but it was the color of white meat chicken and had kind of a mushy texture and tasted nothing like beef. The wontons were not good and the egg roll was tasteless. Even the hot mustard didn't help. The hot and sour soup was your typical pre made variety. My husband had the cashew chicken and said it was tasteless except for the sauce. He said if he had not been so hungry he would not have eaten it. If you have ever had really good Chinese food, don't go here. If you don't know what Chinese food is supposed to taste like, you may like it.

I will say the servers were very nice and did tell me if I came back to tell them not to put all the onions in the beef so they are accommodating. Unfortunately, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered here plenty of times. Best chinese in my opinion. Garlic chicken and honey chicken. Hands down best in gilbert"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Saw the good reviews so we decided to try J&K Gourmet last night. Appetizer and food was OK, not great. Waited on by three different women. Part of our order came out wrong. Did not enjoy the atmosphere, food or experience."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  I just called for a delivery and gave him my order, he laughed and said, \"that isn't enough for deliver\".  I asked, ok what is the minimum?.. he laughed again and said $25.  We went back and fourth because I was trying to figure out how much my total was at that point. He was just completely rude so I ended up not even ordering anything. He could have easily, and politely, told me that there was a $25 minimum for any deliver."}
{"text":"Food was terrible... Granted, we came at 4 pm so I'm sure it was left over from lunch. Still, 13 dollars for an appetizer platter for two should have more than just 2 of 5 items. Bad service, horrid overcooked ribs and their prices are far too high for the quality of food that they serve. Still, we paid our bill and decided to warn people that are looking for a decent Chinese restaurant... Don't go here."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have been here several times.  My wife gets a few different dishes (including kung pao) and I always get the gang pang chicken.  Huge portions, steaming hot, perfectly prepared.  The potstickers are huge and really good.

We tried the chicken wings once -- meh.  There's a spice/herb/seasoning in there that neither of us cared for.

Beer selection is limited, but I guess ya gotta go with a Tsing Tao anyway.

I recommend this place.

Oh, and the owners/staff are awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I get take out or delivery from here almost every week....yes I said delivery, any order over $20 and they'll bring it right to you! Such a relief after a long day of work and doorbell rings with some fried rice and orange chicken mmmmm buddy and the dinner combinations for 1 are a great deal for a lot of food!"}
