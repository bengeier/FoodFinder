{"text":"Really a gem in the desert, I just wanted some Asian foods for my cooking and found a reasonable, friendly, and helpful market. They have cakes, meats, and exotic vegetables to expand your pallet! Really nice cashier, she is always so sweet and helpful every time I go in to shop. One time I was looking for Tokyo vogue, they didn't have it but, the owner offered to order a subscription! \"for a small fee of course\"  You won't find more dedicated people helping you find what you need. : )"}
{"text":"My wife is Japanese and -- after visiting the few that exist -- this is the only Japanese market she'll go to in Metro Phoenix.  New Tokyo Food Market needs a new name probably (wife thinks calling a Japanese market \"New Tokyo\" is lame sauce), but inside... it's the real deal. Good selection and friendly staff.  Careful though before making the trip: closed on Tues and Weds."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was trying to make some Japanese food and had a list of ingredients that were not available in regular stores. I went here and found myself overwhelmed as  most of the products were in Japanese. The ladies working here were so polite and nice and helped me figure things out.  They are awesome and love this place!"}
{"text":"i would give more but there is no more  best store ever i go there Evey day  they are open  the best costumer service  in a.z.   i will recommend this store to every one another cool thing is this food market sells Japanese movies great for my learning i have nothing bad to say about this store only good things"}
{"text":"Unlike other Japanese markets in the area this one has a good selection and the shelves are always well stocked! The staff and owners are super friendly and helpful and the prices are pretty good. Now If only this was bigger and with an even wider selection it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"This is a great little shop that has a wide variety of Japanese goods at reasonable prices.  I tend to fall prey to their freezer section where I buy way too many sweets like daifuku and dango.  They have a great selection of condiments, snacks, candy, pantry goods (such as noodles, rice, curry mixes, furikake seasonings), and other groceries such as tofu and frozen seafood.    In the back, you'll find non-grocery items such as video rentals, stationary supplies, books, dishware, etc.  The owners are quite friendly.  The last time I went, I watched as a first time customer was led around the store according to his shopping list, with the staff member answering all of his questions and explaining the different choices he had.  Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this supermarket! Lots of candy, snacks,            ice cream, beverages, and so on!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a real Japanese market, this is the place. The place isn't big and can sometimes be a little expensive, but with so few options in AZ this is #1."}
{"text":"A small market but with a wonderful selection.  I kind of stopped here on a whim and now I visit regularly.  I come here for their matcha and their beautifully fragrant loose leaf green tea.  Staff is warm, knowledgeable, and always helpful!  Can't recommend enough :)"}
{"text":"This is a small predominantly Japanese market with a small selection of frozen items to compliment the large selection of boxed and canned groceries.  New Tokyo is the closest store to me that has a decent daifuku mochi, so they get stars for that.  They also carry Lotte Mochi Ice, a lighter (lower fat) version of your usual mochi ice cream.  And yes, they carry mochi ice cream too!  I've also purchased fish cake, S&S instant dashi, ponzu sauce, ramen noodles, Portuguese sausage, and other assorted items from here.  They carry a selection of Gatsby Moving Rubber men's hair product, which is a nice alternative to ordering it on Amazon.  I can't give them a 5, since they are often out of items I am looking for (white black bean daifuku mochi), but on the other hand, the owner and employees are extremely nice, and there's always parking.  I highly reccomend checking New Tokyo out!"}
{"text":"The best Japanese grocery store in Arizona ! The place itself is small but is loaded with lots of authentic Japanese products imported from japan. The frozen section has a wide selection of sushi grade seafood like salmon, tuna, mackerel, yellowtail, squid, octopus, eel and both cooked and raw shrimp.   They also carry popular japanese shampoo like tsubaki.  A must go for ppl looking for authentic Japanese products!"}
{"text":"Small store but they carry alot of Japanese items. Its clean and very well organized. Not only do they sell food products they sell beauty items, magazines, stationary, kitchen stuff and more. If you are in the lookout for japanese items I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here, or what all the had to offer. It's not nearly as big as those Asian megamarts. But for its size, New Tokyo certainly packs in a lot of goods.  Their prices are very fair as well. I think I spent about $15, and got sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, wonton wrappers, panko (99 cents!). The liquids were all BIG bottles too.   I'm kind of annoyed that we were in a hurry. I could have spent a lot of time in there, buying LOTS of stuff. I guess that means that I'll just have to go back -- shoot."}
{"text":"This is a great little store, very clean and the ladies working there are always very friendly.  Their prices actually are better on most things that I've purchased than the bigger Asian stores in town.  They've got a little section of Hawaiian products which can be tough to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little shops to visit in Phoenix. It is small and really gives the feeling of stepping into a corner store in Japan.  The selection of candies is excellent. You will find all of your favorites like Pocky, meiji   chocolate macadamia nuts, Karl cheese flavored corn puffs, Kasugai gummies and more. There are two solid isles packed with snacks and candy.  This is a great place to go by yourself or with a few friends. The staff are very friendly and will help you with anything you need."}
{"text":"This place and Fujiya Market are the only two Asian markets I've found in Arizona so far that's really JAPANESE.  It is a little far away from where I live so I usually end up going to Fujiya Market but IF I need something specific, I usually make my effort to drive up there.    *Selection in general = this place has more selection than Fujiya Market *Rice = seems a little cheaper than Fujiya Market *Japanese videos/DVDs = rentals and for sale  Like Fujiya Market, they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables."}
{"text":"Okay, I keep forgetting about this market on the west side... I do go here when I do remember instead of Lee Lee & Ranch L Market. I always load up on basic Japanese cooking supplies; and some fun stuff too. They used to have a little cafe in back; I do miss it..."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this Japanese market but they have everything I needed to make the perfect ramen! They lady in the front was extremely welcoming and very knowledgable about the whereabouts of products I was looking for. Prices seem very reasonable as well. I got the tonkotsu ramen from the fridge/freezer area as well as the Naruto fish cakes.  Ps. Just double check your expiration dates. Found a few things that were expired. But that happens anywhere."}
{"text":"Awesome Market!!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The selection is great and the prices are very reasonable. I love the selection of Japanese snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"Small shop but great place to get Japanese condiments etc for cooking. Its not on the best location in town but this place is own by authetic Japanese which in my book set me at ease.   What I meant by that:if you were to ask me whether I feel more comfortable buying groceries in a Japanese store vs Chinese store, i would say Japanese right away. In my experience Japanese people take pride on their store no matter how small their store is (There is exceptions of course but more often than not this is true. I've been to Japan multiple times in the past to be able to say this). They make sure products on the shelf are fresh and have not expired. If you go to Chinese owned store more often than not they dont care about this stuff. Everything is fair game (Dirty floor, expired food, blood on floor, etc). You should know what I meant  about Chinese store especially if you are Asian lol."}
{"text":"Who knew there's a tiny store in Phoenix that sells Japanese goodies??! I love love Japanese food. This place sells ready to eat beef gyudon, sake, frozen gyoza, different sauces (sukiyaki, tempura sauce, katsudon sauce, rice vinegar etc). The lady at the counter was nice too.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just love this place, if you are cooking Japanese or making Sushi this is the place to go to get all the goodies and have be the best. My last trip I bought some Big Eye Tuna, Hamachi and Salmon it was all just fabulous. Great spot to stock the pantry with all the other hard to find items, the bag of sushi rice I bought has proven to be the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first trip to this store! The cashier was welcoming and kind. I am enjoying my red bean paste pastries more than I had imagined. I wish they had more options for their milk teas but I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea whether there is a Japanese community in this part of town, but New Tokyo would suit one well.  It's rather small, but they have a wide selection of Japanese, snacks, beverages (including my new fave beer, Asahi Black), refrigerated items, staples, etc.    This is not an Asian market, it's specifically Japanese, so don't expect more than a few crossover items like kimchi.  That being said, sometimes it's good to specialize.  It lets them carry more variety of Japanese products.  The cashier was very friendly when I finally stopped loading my basket long enough to check out.  Like the first reviewer, I loaded up with snacks for the hotel room...along with a six-pack of Asahi Black, of course.  Oh, one more important factor...the prices were quite reasonable, in line with most ethnic market imports...maybe even a bit cheaper than usual."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable little store.  Fun, cute and yummy items.  Very clean and well maintained.  Staff are awesome even when our credit card acted up.  Alley pup loved it and really enjoyed the cool floors and smelling all the smells of our favorite store from home in the air."}
{"text":"This is a great market and really the only place I can think of for purchasing Japanese food items.  It is a small store but manages to have a wide selection of items.  There are also a few other items that you would find in just about any Asian or Pacific Island food market, but the main focus is on Japanese food.  Some items can be a bit pricey but that's to be expected since they are shipped from far away locations.  The staff is very friendly, very helpful and will no doubt leave a favorable impression on you. I would definitely recommend shopping here."}
{"text":"I've gone here multiple times and I love it! Best place to get Japanese items in the Phoenix area. I love their selections! 100/10 recommend."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I found myself going to New Tokyo as I had moved out of the area, but I used to go there quite a bit about 5-6 years ago. Since the last time I've gone things have only gotten better! They have quite a nice selection for a small market and their products are VERY well priced! They have the best selection of Pocky out of anywhere I've seen it sold and now they have quite a nice selection of curry, which made me rather happy! If I need a couple quick items I'll definitely be going to Tokyo Market in order to support their wonderful shop and I'll recommend it to everyone! I I'm alredy anxious to go back and buy so more gummys, pocky and ramune! :)"}
{"text":"This is like a random treasure spot in Phoenix next to a random pawn shop and a title loan place. Anyway, it's a small market but they have some pretty good stuff here. Sauces, noodles, refrigerated goods, drinks, snacks, curry, etc. You won't find any fresh produce but it will surely save you the trouble of going into Tempe or Mesa for the bigger Asian markets if you need something quick. The workers even speak Japanese to you. It's great!!!"}
{"text":"I love this market. It's no Marukai/Mitsuwa, but I can find what I need here. The staff is so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. I'm willing to pay the price for the goods (not all are expensive, mind you) for the simple fact that the customer service is great, the store is clean, and the selection is fairly high.   I love the lady that helped us out. She was very sweet and caring.   I could go on and on about the customer service, but I'll spare you all further pain.  Go here, you wont be disappointed (unless you're flat broke.)"}
{"text":"I have been shopping at New Tokyo a few time a year for about 12 years now.  Growing up my family hosted Japanese students and when i was in high school I spent a summer in Japan.  New Tokyo reminds of the little mom and pop markets located in the neighborhood I stayed in while in Japan.  It's not a huge store but it's got what you will need.  Rice, Yakisoba, Tofu, bean past, frozen fish, Eal, Udon Noodles, masago, lots of snacks, and instant noodles.   They have just about every thing you would need to fix a traditional Japanese meal and much more.  The people here are always very friendly and helpful.  Don't hesitate to venture in and ask for help if your not sure what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Aloha islanders, If you're looking for Marukai and Shirokiya quality. Nuff said. Awesome market. If you're Asian and you would know it by walking in here and loving this clean bright space with almost everything you could want or need. I was looking for my strong flavored mochi crunch for the movies and ended  up dropping a c note. Love ,love , love. If you miss home visit here.  Aloha ohana!"}
{"text":"Do you want authentic Japanese food, drink, little toys, book, free newspaper? Don't waste no time, and come to Tokyo food market. This is Da place!!  I found this place by accident, to my surprise this turns out fully stocked Japanese grocery / convinience store from heaven. And pricing was juuuust right!!   The owner is very very nice gentleman, I chat with him a while and found out how much of knowledge he has for Japan and Japanese biz.   I ended up more than I needed, but I'm very happy to go home with so many Japanese grocery items.   This is true gem in town!"}
{"text":"Love New Tokyo! Friendliest family owned place,  great selection and very fair pricing. Love the homemade salmon triangles,  but you have to get there early or they're gone!"}
{"text":"hard to think the valley can support two japanese grocery stores, especially with this one being located in the part of town that probably has almost no japanese population.    but this store is a real gem.  i hope they stay around for a long time.  very friendly people here.  i actually think this place is better-stocked than fuji mart.  prices on the whole may be a bit cheaper, too.  it has all the japanese essentials and a whole lot more.  some unexpected finds, including certain snacks and condiments i hadn't even seen in mitsuwa.  they rent japanese dvd's, as well."}
{"text":"I like the small grocery shop feel it provides and I go here for my favorite Matcha candies! Moreover, I like how its easy to navigate through their stores and find almost everything related to Japanese cooking."}
{"text":"Not sure how I never realized this place existed until now. I love Sun Noodle fresh ramen and used to pick up a bunch of packages whenever I was in LA. I was so happy to see New Tokyo Food Market carries it! They also have a nice selection of udon noodles, sauces, seaweed and other goodies. The owners, Ron and Suzue, were very nice and personable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Moved to Prescott 8 months ago. Been Jonesing for some Japanese food supplies and you can't find anything up here in the north. Found this store online and made a trip while going to Scottsdale. Very small store but well stocked for most Japanese eats. Got Soy paper for the wife and got a bunch of other stuff.  Things looked good there, store was clean and people were friendly. I will go back when I need more Japanese cooking supplies."}
{"text":"This is a small shop is a gem - the only place in Phoenix that carries everything I want from a Japanese market. The fermented \"pickle\" selection rivals markets in San Francisco, as does the fresh miso selection (clearly, the two most important things to me).  The staff is beyond pleasant and very helpful. Sake selection is the bomb, as well. Don't be afraid to try new snack foods! Seaweed flavored chips really can be delicious!"}
{"text":"My absolute go-to for my favorite Japanese candies and snacks! I do wish they carried more of the DIY candy sets, however, I can't complain because they're the only place, other than It'Sugar, to carry any of them. Plus, New Tokyo is WAY better priced than It'Sugar. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm SO INCREDIBLY happy to have gone to this store. I'm Japanese and am giving you my approval!! I've been unsatisfied with other Japanese store - not to mention its name but quite obvious- but New Tokyo has fulfilled my needs that I usually get shipped from back home. Store is very clean and the owner is very kind! I'll be shopping here from now on!!?!"}
{"text":"Okay for small trip.  Small store but a little of everything.  Store was clean and well-lit and cashier was very polite.  Prices are too high on some items, I saw a lot of the same items at the new Korea Mart in Mesa (which carries both Korean and Japanese stuff) for 2/3 or less the price.  It's not their fault, but it's not a good neighborhood, was there in late morning and lots of very sketchy looking men all around just loitering and staring."}
{"text":"This is a great Oriental food market.  I have been to quite a few and I have not found anything close to Tokyo Market.  The ladies are genuinely happy to see you and they understand and speak English, this is in contrast to other Oriental markets I have been to.  Good selection, clean, and I look forward to goig back.  I will be a customer for some time to come."}
{"text":"So as far as I know, there are only two dedicated Japanese markets: Fujiya and this place. I've been to Fujiya many times. I like it. I think it's good enough. But after I went to New Toyko, I found it to be better in terms of pricing and stock. The lady also seemed more genuine of a person while maintaining politeness. She doesn't have that kind of fake polite vibe I get from other people.   Overall, if I lived closer to here, I'd go here much more often. But for now, I will go to Fujiya, which isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic Japanese food and other items. They are a small shop, but have a nice selection and some other ethnic foods as well. (Hawaiian, Chinese, etc.) The staff is always courteous, friendly and willing to help. They won't try and sell you anything. Every time I ask for assistance, they always steer me to the most economical products that will accomplish my goals. A few days ago, I went in pick up some sake for cooking. The older lady (perhaps an owner) asked me if I liked the brand of sake I had chosen. I told her that I had never tried it, but it was for cooking. She recommended that I purchase a much cheaper, smaller bottle if I was cooking with it only and showed me her recommendation. ($2.49) I appreciate their honesty and integrity!"}
{"text":"Whoa!  This was an unexpected find for me.  I was in town for business randomly searching around for something to eat and I came across this place by accident.  Good selection of snacks (loaded up for the hotel room).  Not the full blown places like the ones back home, yet It was very cool to run into a place like this out there."}
{"text":"I would give it five stars, I just did not know what I wanted there. If I knew more about the products I would have wanted more. But, they had what I went for, Green Tea Match! And, they even had the little bamboo whisk to blend it with. I saved on shipping, I was about to order these things online. Very friendly too. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really do love this place. This is where my husband picks up all the fish he uses for Sushi. The couple that runs the place are very knowledgeable about their products are are two of the sweetest people ever. This certainly isn't your big box Asian markets like Asiana or Lee Lee, but they have great products, good prices and really friendly staff.   Certainly check this place out, it has amazing food, snacks, and goodies!"}
{"text":"We'll definitely be back. As other reviewers hve mentioned, New Tokyo is smaller than Lee Lee or Asiana, however they had a great selection and carried everything we were looking for and more. Their prices were really reasonable. The people working were very friendly and willing to help, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"I've been to New Tokyo Food Market when it was just a year old. It has been some time, but even upon my first visit there were ingredients I couldn't find anywhere else. Today I was looking for some white miso (for a salmon recipe) and ended up buying some clothing, apple sake, japanese snacks and other ingredients too! They expanded there inventory to include japanese books, movies and cookware. The cookware is of better quality than any other Japanese stores I've been to in the area. I plan to go back and make care pac to my friends who don't have a Authentic Japanese Store in the area~  I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is a great market, with a great selection of dry goods as well as foodstuff. The people inside the store are very helpful and are willing to make special orders if you know just what you want. I will admit, I'm puzzled by what the recording says when I walk in/out, and by what some of the stuff says as I have no understanding of how to read ideograms but great place nonetheless. I've been addicted to Ramune since Matsuri festival last year and this is only one of two places I've seen it since. They have a small selection of sake and beer, but most importantly, all the \"junk food,\" spices, noodles, etc.   do atishi mashite New Tokyo!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were skeptical about entering this place, as it is in a pretty rough part of Phoenix, but inside the store there are tons of Japanese items to buy.  While I like Lee Lee's, I love the fact that this store specializes in only Japanese products.  They have the ramun sodas that we like and some pretty awesome candy and chips.  I can definitely see why this place was featured in the Best of Phoenix, especially when Asian markets are so hard to come by in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great prices, great selection. I didn't get a chance to look at all of the different sauces and foods - I was too busy deciding which Sake to take home! ;)"}
{"text":"4 stars for the sashimi grade fish -- I bought Salmon and Yellowtail here. It's a very tiny store, but I'm glad it's here. I'd go back for the fish or the tea here. Not too sure what else I'd be purchasing."}
{"text":"I Love this store and its variety of Japanese products. Found everything I was looking for and what made it even better are the ladies that work there. They are very friendly. Worth the 30 minute drive for me. Will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Went to New Tokyo Food Market today for some Japanese staples...Miso soup, nori (dried seaweed), Osenbei (flavored rice crackers), Furikake (dried seasoning mix) and Panko bread crumbs for Tempura recipes and they carry many other hard to find Japanese products. Prices are very reasonable and most products are authentic and not Americanized versions. Owner came over and helped us with our selections without being asked! Very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend this market located on S/E corner of 35th Ave. and Northern. Parking area is limited however! Banzai!!!!"}
