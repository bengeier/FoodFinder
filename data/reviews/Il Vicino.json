Nous sommes revenu 20 ans plus tard avec nos kidz pour re-déguster leur Lasagne D'Ambruzzo et leur entrée de Zuchini frits.... FANTASTIC !!!!

Ça refait surgir des souvenirs de bonheur.

{"text":"Back in the 1980's and 90's this place was THE place to go, along with The Rustik. The Dumouchel family took pride in providing an exceptional service, with the freshest food and surprisingly reasonable prices. Jules Dumouchel passed away a few years ago, and things are starting to slip. Service has always been good, but the quality of the food has gone down, and the prices have been constantly going up. My last visit was a few months ago when I went to the Sunday night Roast Beef buffet. The salad bar had spoiled tomatoes, brown lettuce. The cold pasta was too oily, and the roast beef was so full of fat that there was hardly any meat left. The dessert bar had small berries that had just about passed their prime, and, what I thought was yogurt, tasted like sour cream. Who puts sour cream on berries for dessert? Their pizzas are still affordable during the early supper special, but I felt really disappointed about the buffet, and the lack of passion that this place has once had. 

Update: Since I first reviewed this restaurant, I decided to return and try it out again. Things have improved. The eccentric buffet chef certainly adds life to the evening, and the food was pretty decent this time around. The price is on the higher end, but compared to other classy establishments in town, it's about on par."}

       A good friend of mine, Nicholas Giambattisto(remember the name), used to work the pizza oven.

     They offer a special, $4.95 for an all dressed pizza any day but Saturday, before 6. 

       My man Nicholas would hook me up with oodles of bruschetta, spinach, bacon to make it an amazing pie for 5 bucks. Great crust too...but everything else on the menu sucks as does the service so just stick to the pizza
