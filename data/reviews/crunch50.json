{"text":"I've been here twice now, first time was great, the guy working was so sweet showed us around and explained everything. He even asked us what music we liked and played that throughout our visit. The second time, my friend and I went about 10 mins before closing time I know, annoying, but when you close you close. We only wanted to run in and get some soft serve. As soon as we walked in we were greeted (or not) by a girl who was very obviously annoyed we came in, and proceeded to remind us they close in 10 mins. She didn't ask us if we needed help, she was annoyed she had to turn on the machine, which she shouldn't have turned off until closing anyways. I used to work at a restaurant so I understand it's annoying for people to come in just before close, but it was a decent amount of time for us to come in and grab something. We weren't planning on eating there or anything. And when you close at a certain time that's the time you close and anyone who wants to come in (regardless if you agree or not) should be able to up until that clock says 9pm. And you don't have an attitude about it, and you treat them like a human being even if you're pissed. Besides that last experience I had here I liked this place. Even though it seems easy to figure out I think it could be set up better and a little easier for customers to figure out. I feel like it's a little confusing. This would've been 5 stars if I hadn't had that second visit but unfortunately I did. I'm not sure if I'll be back because of it."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place!  If you're like me you love breakfast cereal any time of the day, and this place feeds that affinity with all of your favorite cereals and lots of cool toppings.  Add on Cartel coffee on tap and you have all the elements needed to make your day great.  If you're at all near this place check it out!  Lots of space and really great staff.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - offerings are a great way to start the day - I love that it's a local business with a commitment to customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"My mom took me in here this morning and I got the biggest bowl of 4 cereals and it was SO good! I could even get chocolate milk over my cereal, but my mom said no way... I played Pac Man and my mom had Iced Coffee from Coffee Cartel. We talked with the owner for a bit and he was very nice to us. We will be back to try their Pineapple Whip, my mom says its the old stuff they used to sell at Disneyland."}
{"text":"Crunch50 is a great addition to the area! Excellent customer service, owners are very friendly and welcoming, fun vibe, lots of cereal choices, soft serve with yummy toppings and really good coffee. Very affordable too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This small business is new to the Moon Valley area.  I commend them for being a good corporate neighbor and recommend their establishment be supported by surrounding neighborhoods."}
{"text":"If I listed the number of cereals available here I would still be writing this. Also the coffee is v/good."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Quality food, friendly service, and they dont disappoint!! The cereal waffles are delicious!! I highly recommend crunch 50!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, family like staff. Lost of choices, plus Saturday morning cartoons. The pac man arcade was set to free play, so that's tight. To be honest, yelp makes me write more which is dumb but this place is cool go to it."}
{"text":"Just came in for some Cartel so I need to visit for breakfast.  The decor is creative and the coin free packman arcade is an added touch.  Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is  a relatively new place. The kids that were there were having a great time. It's a fun concept. I was nearby and decided to go in and check it out.  Friendly staff and they were happy to explain how \"it worked\" i.e. cereals, toppings, different kinds of milk, oatmeal, bagels etc.   I decided to have a coffee prior to leaving. It's coffee from the \"pump style urns.\"  The young woman assured me that the coffee would be hot,  I mentioned that I really prefer hot coffee to be \"hot.\"  I took my \"to go\" cup and left.   My first sip - warm -- not hot coffee and frankly the coffee was awful.  I returned, told the two young staffers that the coffee wasn't hot as promised and that it was truly awful coffee. The young woman smiled and after hesitating....said with a big smile \"thanks for the feedback, I'll tell the owners.\"     Owners:  It might be good to train the staff to at least try to fix the problem i.e.  \"can we get you a different cup?\"   \"Would you like to try a different coffee as a replacement?\"  All else failing \"let me get you a refund, we don't want you to pay for something you don't enjoy.\"    There was no microwave or other device that would \"heat up\" the coffee, should someone like to \"warm it up a bit.\""}
{"text":"Cool concept. Good prices. Great customer service. If you're in the area definitely give them a try. Who doesn't like cereal?"}
{"text":"I love cereal bars!  Phoenix has had random ones pop up.  Crunch50 is awesome!  Selection of 50 cereals to choose from.  Quite a few not usually available locally.  Great decor.  Plus cartoons playing and free video games and board games.  A perfect Saturday morning, just like when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Extremely rude female owner. Will never come back and will never recommend again! Plus the prices are extremely overpriced especially for what they offer. Not worth the money or treatment."}
{"text":"Spotted this place a couple weeks ago and decided to have brunch here with a few friends. I like supporting local businesses, so thought it'd be fun to try.  The girl working was friendly and explained everything clearly for what was at each station. Looking at the shop, the decor was cute and the art interesting.  However, there were still a few things left to be desired. While there was great variety in cereals, not a whole lot in their toppings station. Their toppings station also seemed to be a bit more dessert oriented, so a bit limited in healthier options. The store did appear a bit disorganized with inventory cluttered beneath the cereal station. As well, considering what it is, it's rather pricey. For a large bowl of cereal (minimal size difference between that and the small, mind you) and a drink, it was more than $8.  Overall, it was a fun little novelty experience. I think it'd be especially enjoyable for people with children with all the cereal options and board games they have to play with. Or, if you're looking for something different to try for weekend brunch. Personally though, I probably won't be going back any time soon mainly due to price. For the same amount, I could get a heartier meal at a couple of the brunch spots just up the street. I think if they work on this aspect, it would help rake in more business. Friend of mine who lives down the street from it has said when she passes by it is normally empty, and even today my friends and I were the only people inside."}
{"text":"Cute, clean and great service! Dole whip and vegan vanilla frozen yogurt. Delicious. Waffles with fro-yo and fun cereal is next on the list. I'm an accidental customer, as I live far from the location, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Owner was not customer friendly- & Won't be going back anytime soon. Complained that I was going to be using a Groupon- and she said that she understood it was a marketing thing and that she'd be on the losing end of the deal... I don't think that she should  be giving me the grief -that she's not happy about the Groupon deal- if she doesn't like it then maybe don't advertise/sell it on Groupon -"}
{"text":"The kids love cereal so we had to come try it out !! This place is great and so many choices! The service great and very helpful. Mom's this place is super kid friendly"}
{"text":"I have to admit it...I love cereal!! I could easily eat a whole box of many of my Favorites!! So I was excited to check out this new business in the area! I just went on a scouting to explore what it's all about!! I have to confess at the time of my visit I had already had breakfast so I didn't actually order or eat there this visit. I stopped in to check out the interior and find out what they offered in selected cereals. The employee that was there was very sweet and informative. The place was empty so she was happy to give me a tour of the place! It's very cute and I love the concept idea... However, I'm concerned about the prices that may be an issue for the businesses continued existence. I assumed that it would be a pay an amount then it would be like all you could eat or something....No. They are intending to charge approximately $3.50 for each bowl!!! I took a photo of the menu...I just remember being struck with the impression of Wow!! That's kinda expensive for 1 bowl of cereal when a whole Box would be approximately that price depending where you shop. So, my second thought was...I wonder how long they will last...no one was there at my visit. That was an early morning week day when folks would be having some yummy cereal. I'm going to go in and try it out- because my love for cereal is Strong!! I also Love to support new small businesses in the area...I really hope this little spot makes it but they may have to work on the pricing to get folks in there to enjoy their concept! Good Luck Crunch50! I'm coming in for Fruity Pebbles...better stock up!!"}
{"text":"Cereal!!! You can mix your old favorites and try some new ones all in one bowl! They even have fruity pebble flavored bagels! The staff is very friendly and helpful.  And when your done, you can play arcade games for free!  We had a great morning at Crunch50."}
{"text":"Completely awesome very innovative idea! cartel coffee.  Go support this local business!!!"}
{"text":"Where else can take a 13-year-old and a five year old to have fun.  Here!  Fun  food,  games and a hip place for both.  The gal who served us was great!  Very friend"}
{"text":"So many awesome cereals, board games, and classic arcade games....delicious coffee (new fan of Cartel, big time).....fun all around for you and your kids (or even just you and your inner child). Friendly woman that helped and served us today. I Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is ADORABLE and every kids dream! They have a wall of every cereal you can think of, a waffle maker, and parfaits! Not to mention board games and toys for the kids. My fiance tried the coffee and said it was great! today they had a balloon guy so my kids were stoked. Such a great place for kids! Will be coming back for sure and telling friends and family."}
{"text":"A plethora of cereals, even varieties you can't find in store like waffle crunch! My husband and I stopped in here because my husband LOVES cereal. So this place seemed like a no brainer to try out. The concept is simple, you grab a small or large bowl and fill it up with whatever cereals you like and add toppings if you like and then choose your milk. It was glorious. We had two bowls of cereal a piece :P your second bowl is half off same visit. Very affordable and from what I can tell you can't go wrong. I had waffle crunch, mixed with s'more cereal and krave. Super tasty! They also gave us a little cup to fill with cereal for our son as he is under 2 at no charge :) we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. It's a cereal bar--grab a bowl, choose your cereal, pay. Apparently they have 50 choices, and also oat meal. I had Honey Smacks, because I haven't had Honey Smacks in 20 years. They were just as good as I remember.  The kids working there are very nice and clearly care about the business. It's a comfortable space to chill. They have Cartel coffee made with filtered water, ice cream, and some grab and go selections, such as yogurt or boiled eggs. The music is very hip.  I think my favorite touch is the Ms Pac Man arcade game. It's the favorite arcade game of Raymond Reddington, and that makes this place infinitely cool."}
