{"text":"It's shitty diner food. I love it.   I would give it more (or maybe less stars....most likely more) if I had eaten at the diner. This was a Grubhub order.   Food came cold (no one's fault but my own) but appeared to me that it was probably decent when it was hot off the press.   I just can't knock diners. It's a diner.....we need more of them."}
{"text":"Used GH to place my order and shortly after received a phone call. She had a few follow up questions bc the app needed to be redone some things weren't correct, she gives me the example that also I'm out of the delivery area but this one time they will do it.  I am 1.2mi away. Limited area no?  The food, blah, cornbeef sandwich out of a can for $7, no thanks."}
{"text":"If your wasted good then order. Delt like everything was super microwaved. Service was really fast and accurate, so for that I won't discount then out just yet. But they are pushing it.  One last try."}
{"text":"Love getting delivering! Always prompt and delicious. You have to love a diner that delivers, doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"gross food even worse service. i'm not exaggerating when i say that i have never experienced service this bad"}
{"text":"Excellent!!  I placed an order using the Grub Hub app and they delivered with in 30 mins."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of a friend on a Sunday morning. We were only the people in there, received great, very personable service, and good food cooked basically right in front of us. Oh, and it's real cheap. I think my whole meal was like $6. This is a great hole in the wall diner.   It is open 24 hours which is a definite plus if I ever come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's one of the most affordable diners I've come across in Cleveland and everyone is always very welcoming and nice. It's been around for ages, so I'm told, and the building is a bit small, but that just adds to the cozy feeling. If you want a stupid cheap burger ( $3) or hot dog ($1.50) or a breakfast made to perfection ya gotta try this tiny little gem out."}
