{"text":"I heard about the free pound of wings and thought I'd give Rocky's a try. Well first off, that was no pound, it was 6 little segments, probably a little less than a half pound. And they were ok but not great. There was a dog running around loose in the bar, nobody seemed to mind so I figured it was the owner's. Overall my impression is that this is yet another Pittsburgh outskirts kind-of-run-down bar with nothing really special to make it worth the trip, so like the others, a half dozen or so regulars come in to sip a beer and watch TV."}
{"text":"We ordered for the office here. Everyone liked their grub. The portions are huge. 

I got this tennis shoe sized Reuben piled high with tender, juicy corned beef. There wasn't alot of saurkraut on it, which can either be just how you like it or not so much. I like plenty of saurkraut but there's so much meat on the sandwich, who cares? The rye bread was huge, at least 9\" long and 6\" wide. Where they get rye bread that huge? I dunno. But its delicious. You also get a side with every sandwich, mashed, fries or coleslaw. I got the fries. Alot of time when you get fries, delivered, they're soggy,  limp or just not that great. These fries were actually crispy. My sandwich, plus tip, was $9.00 and a total steal.

One of my coworkers got the Monsterburger. Its a half pound juggernaut that's about five inches high. Plenty of fixings. All the sandwiches are huge. The price is right, too. Nine of us ordered and the price came to $82. We delivered at 12:30 and the food was here in about a half hour.

After reading the other review, my mouth's watering over their wings. I love wings. Glancing at the menu, they have 17 beers on tap. I have a very good hunch that this is another gem hidden in the Rocks.

And speaking of the menu...its not just subs, sandwiches and bar food. They have everything from nachos and pierogies to mussels and crab legs. Salads, pasta and full dinners like pork chops, meatloaf and liver and onions. Pizza, ribs, BBQ chicken, plenty of seafood...this place has a large menu.

I plan on stopping in sometime to have a sit down meal here."}
{"text":"I WON'T RETURN. RUDE MANAGER! 
I was invited by a friend to go for dinner. She had been there one other time and had the Italian Hoagie. Said it was good. This time she was interested in trying the meatball hoagie.   I decided on the Fish Romano. I thought the menu said it CAME WITH lemon wine sauce. So that is what sold me on trying it.  When I received it I didn't see the sauce and thought they might have forgotten to put it on. I asked the server and she said it is COOKED IN THE SAUCE! My mistake in not reading the menu carefully bc it leads you to believe that the sauce is over the top.  The server was nice enough to bring me lemon slices which helped a great deal with the dryness of the dish. 

The portion size was over the top huge!  4 full size fillets! Enough to feed a family!   The fish was very good but it REALLY NEEDED SOME KIND OF SAUCE! 
I chose the baked potato as my side. It also was large but was not the freshest. On the starchy side. 

My biggest problem ... was with the Manager/ maybe the owner??  He kept rolling his eyes at us, the patrons sitting at the bar, because in his eyes, our server was not performing her duties.  He was letting us know that he was not happy with her.  
When he asked how our meals were, I proceeded to tell him that I thought the fish came with a sauce over top. He frowned at me and said, \"Was it good?\"  I said, \"Yes, only after she gave me lemons!\"  He didn't want to hear anything more. He took my plate and walked away.  In his book, as long as it was good then he didn't care what else I had to say.  I'm not sure if he realizes that it's the PATRONS that pay his bills and keep his business open!  
I've been in the restaurant business for 40 years. 
As a server, manager and owner! 
If I ever saw or heard a Manager treating employee's badly or worse yet saw a manager insinuating to the guests that he was not happy with an employee, it would be the MANAGER that would be reprimanded/fired!  
Our server did a great job!!  You could tell that he had her upset and for no reason. 
I felt that he was being very chauvinistic. 
He was very short and rude to me and that is why I won't return. I won't be back to have him ruin my dinner again. 
Sorry Rocky's II"}
{"text":"Stopped here spur of the moment, glad I did.
It was a Monday night around 7, the bar was pretty full and about half of the tables were, also. Nice, Clean place. It was Yuengs and Wings Night. Buy a Yuengling for $1.35 and get a pound of wings for free. Hard to beat. I had 2 Yuengs, one order of free wings and an order of Potato Skins. Total $5.69, hahaha. The wings were really good, one piece(fiddler and drum connected). Mild was hot and spicy. A guy at the bar recommended Hot Cajun, hmmm, maybe mild cajun, hehe.
 I'm definitely going back. A sign noted that after 5 on Thursdays it's AYCE Wings for $3.95."}
