{"text":"I tried the food first time here and enjoyed it.Good food and service.I liked Chicken shawarma its really too good."}
{"text":"If you want unbelievably good Mediterranean food on the West side of town, this is the place. We haven't been thrilled with the other west side Mediterranean offerings, even though one of them receives a high rating here (maybe it's what we ordered). When we bring Freska home for dinner, there is complete silence at the table while everyone (even kids) gorge themselves. Wow."}
{"text":"Excellent, helpful service.  The beef kebabs tasted like perfectly cooked steak.  Good quality food."}
{"text":"Good value for the money and a nice change of pace from fast food restaurants.  My wife and I had dinner here on a Thursday evening.  My wife had pastichio and a salad.  She described it as \"pretty good\".  I had a gyro dinner.  My meal was tasty but wasn't particularly hot when it was served.  Ambience is fine.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was awful. I ordered the veggie plate. The falafel was very dry and couldn't even be picked up....they just fell apart. The tahini sauce was bitter. The hummus and tabbouleh and babaganush (sp?) were tasteless.  Waste of $10."}
{"text":"I happen to work in this area as well. Having Mediterranean for lunch is a treat. Chicken shwarma and gyros are great. The only thing about this place is that English understanding can be a challenge for some workers."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner here last night.  We both had chicken shawarma with tzatziki (yogurt) sauce and it was delicious!  The staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the various dishes.  The price is extremely reasonable, too.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there three times in one month.  Always ordered Veggie feast. It was amazing. Nice and friendly people. Falafel and pita were great. They give so much food for that price. Baklava was not good so i cut one star. Other than that good place."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, delicious, and plentiful!  I like that you get to chose 4 sides/toppings with a gyro plate. We can share one plate (sometimes adding a side of fries) between two people and leave happy."}
{"text":"This is bar none the best place for Mediterranean food in town and it's not surprising, the owner is from Greece and immigrated to the US a long time ago.  He and his brother have had a number of successful ventures in town.  I had the lamb and beef Gyro and it was hands down the best I've had anywhere.  The one person who claimed it was \"mediocre\" obviously doesn't know authentic Greek.  Fantastic find this place."}
{"text":"I'm glad Greenway Station got some new restaurants, and I'm definitely glad Freska is one of them.  I'd say that Freska is essentially the Mediterranean version of Chipotle.  You get to pick your base (rice, couscous), meat, and veggies.  The ingredients are fresh, high quality, and flavorful.  My first time in I was so confused with how everything worked and the server was really nice in explaining the whole process and what everything was.  I got the steak which was quite tender. I kinda wish they'd give a bit more for what I was paying (8-9 dollars).  The one major thing that I didn't really like was that everything was so separated that it was hard to mix it all into a nice \"bowl\".  Overall, great selection and quality though! Must try :)"}
{"text":"Very average at best.  It seems to be a knock off of gyroville which is much better. Gyro meat floating in a pan not fresh cut which took all the flavor out. The tazieki sauce has a gritty texture. The gyro was made like a taco which made it very messy. The French fries were cheap frozen fries, undercooked and over salted, not edible."}
{"text":"Nice and clean and full of great options - what will hurt this business is the awful service. We have enjoyed the food here several times now, the veggie feast, gyro, beef, chicken kabob were all very tasty. The hummus could use a little more flavor but overall it's wonderful to have a fresh eating option in Greenway Place. However, customers from the surrounding area are on a tight schedule and used to good service (five guys, Starbucks) and the service here has been beyond bad. Servers don't know how to answer questions about the food, are very slow, don't speak English (my Spanish translation to Greek food names is not so great) and are painfully slow. Please please hire better help! We really want you to stay in business!"}
{"text":"I work in the area, and this is my favorite go to. Food is fresh and reasonably healthy for fast food.  Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because of their soup options. Not a fan of their lentil vegetarian soup.  If they came up with a better vegetarian soup would change this to a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Yet another time where I wish Yelp would allow me a half star rating. I think for Madison, Freska is a solid 3.5 star place. Freska is supposed to be a healthy, fast food type restaurant featuring Mediterranean style food. The restaurant is set in a big, decorated atmosphere. Finally, they are one of the few fast food places that serve a selection of alcohol. So it is like Chipotle, except Mediterranean style. . .  You can get a variety of Mediterranean options here including lamb and beef gyros or kebabs in either sandwhich or platter form. You choose your bread, meat, and a number of toppings. I chose to go with a lamb and beef gyro platter with feta, kalamata olives, tomatoes, and cucumbers.   Everything was sure enough fresh tasting. The tzatziki sauce that is topped on a sandwhich or platter seemed to be different than the prepacked tzatziki that one gets if they ask for it on the side, both in color and ingredients - not sure where the cucumbers were in either.  What bothered me the most is that by the time I took my food to the table, most of it was just lukewarm. The gyro meat is shaved off the spit periodically and put into a warmer. If you order this particular meat, it goes from the little warmer box to your plate.  They need to put it on the griddle just for the minute and get it hot. I noticed the kebabs that other people ordered were grilled to order,  so I presume this is less of an issue for kebabs.  One of the few places in Madison to enjoy a gyro, but, certainly some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Fresh and plenty of it.  1/2 greek chicken that was nicely done and falling off the bone.  Great little salad.  My new favorite."}
{"text":"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL: recently returned with a friend for a late lunch (around 2pm) after a busy Saturday morning of shopping. One lady started making our food when an older gentleman, who I presume to be the owner, zoomed over from his laptop at a booth to begin cooking/assembling our food. He shooed the original lady away without washing his hands....and never put on gloves. I'm definitely not normally a germ freak but come on.  Also, we were the only people in the place and every table was dirty.   The chicken gyro was better than the first time but I'd still rather spend less for a better gyro and better service at the mall."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for a fast, healthy, and inexpensive lunch. I do not feel guilty at all after I eat here! If you have ever been to Greece, you feel like this place encompasses a little piece of it. Everything is white and blue, with olive branches. The food is simple, fresh, and healthy. First, I love that you can order online (or on Yelp!). Have no fear if you didn't order in advance. This place is cafeteria (or \"chipotle\") style, so you can still get in and out quickly.  I always order a plate with chicken shawarma and I pick my other goodies depending on my mood. I've had their gyro too and it was also delish. The owner sliced it fresh for me on the spot! Their spinach salad is great too and I love their raspberry vinaigrette. I haven't tried their baklava yet...but maybe next time? I could eat lunch here every day!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were too high.   I have a tendency to compare this type of restaurant to middle eastern / Mediterranean restaurants in Illinois.   Even by wisconsin standards both of the entrees I sampled fell flat. It seemed like everything was under salted and under seasoned. Chicken Schwarma sandwich seemed to be plain chicken breast strips on a pita. The beef kebab was equally unimpressive. Even the tzatziki for the sandwich fell flat.   Madison does not have many options when I get the Mediterranean itch, but I doubt I'll be back to Freska."}
{"text":"Freska is a welcome addition to the Middleton/Far West Side of Madison.  It's nice having an alternative to burgers.    The menu is small with salads, pita sandwiches with gyro meat (lamb/beef or chicken), kabobs (beef or chicken) and falafel.  The sandwich options also are offered as a platter with rice, couscous, or salad included.    I had the lamb and beef gyro to go.  It was very good and filling.  Service was friendly and very fast."}
{"text":"I travel to middleton for business on a regular basis and was turned on to Freska on one of my trips. All I can say is this place is very good. Ask for the Greek salad with meat. It'll fill you up and its very tasty."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best to be quite honest. There are much better Mediterranean options in Madison. It's kinda like a Mediterranean version of Chipotle, where you choice your meat, rice, veggies etc. The sauces here such as the tahini are extremely bland and have a sand paper texture to it. The hummus here is bad, I've had better hummus that's been prepackaged at the grocery store. I tried the lamb platter and the chicken kebab platter. Both were underwhelming. The meat in both platters were barely luke warm, closer to cold.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. I tried it twice, definitely not going back. Thought it'd be better the second time, I was wrong. The owner didn't seem to care about customers when I came in. He didn't bother to acknowledge people and it wasn't busy, no excuse to ignore people who are supporting your business."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place out, but now that I have, sadly I doubt I'll be going back.    FOOD: I ordered the falafel with lettuce, cucumbers, hummus, tzatziki sauce, and onions.  Honestly, the best part of the \"sandwich\" were the onions (they seemed to be marinated in something making them more sweet/sour tasting).  The falafel itself was not cooked enough so it wasn't crispy at all and didn't hold together very well.  The tzatziki sauce was a really strange consistency; it was gritty and paste-like.  I also tried a piece of baklava.  I opened the plastic container and realized immediately that there were no crispy, flakey layers one would (and should) expect from baklava. It was more like an anemic piece of pecan pie with mushy layers.  Everything was so bland.  I was so disappointed.  Had I not gotten to-go and brought it home to eat, I would have asked for my money back.  If you're into \"fresher\" food options this might fit your bill.  You can choose what kind of protein and other items you want on your sandwich or platter and they make it there in front of you (the falafal were pulled from the freezer and then deep fried).  COST: It was $9 and some change for what I ordered and that was without a beverage.    INTERIOR: It wasn't busy when I visited.  There were maybe 5 other people there (I was there on a Sunday afternoon), but perhaps it's busier during the week from people who work nearby. The interior is quite large and therefore very echoy (chair scuffs and running machine noises reverberate easily).  If you prefer quiet, intimate settings for dining, I doubt this would be your place.    SERVICE: Prompt and friendly.  The staff was helpful when I asked questions about the options available.  Overall, it was similar to concession stand food.  It's okay to fill up on if you're hungry, but it would not be my first choice (or second choice for that matter) as a place to eat at again."}
{"text":"This is the best 'fast food' I've had in a long time! Counter order service and then take your tray to a table and self-bus when finished. The food is fresh Mediterranean and has been consistently delicious and seemingly very healthy! The dining area is slightly sterile feeling, but I will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a quick, healthy, and affordable meal."}
{"text":"Basically the chipotle of Mediterranean food. Great options and great prices. I love how you can choose the four different sides, and there are so many that I try new ones each time I go back. Madison doesn't have enough quick food options that are somewhat healthy. You can definitely make options to have a fairly healthy meal here. I recommend the chicken schwarma - either plate or pita!"}
{"text":"There doesn't seem to be a glut of Greek places on the west side, so I was pleased when Freska opened up at the Lifestyle Center next to Cosi's. For those dining in, it is cafeteria style. The menu can get confusing for those not versed on it (different meats, up to four toppings, platter or sandwich). They had white or wheat pita bread, but only gave us white. I have to recommend the lamb/beef gyro, very tasty. Be forewarned: This place is all hard surfaces, with decorative metal tiles on the wall next to the booths. Yes, it is easy to keep clean, but your kiddos shrieks and screams echoing off the walls can bother other people if you care about such things. Speaking of which, you need to bus your own table when you are done."}
{"text":"Needed something quick and not a greasy burger last night. This fit the bill. Walked down from my hotel, was greeted when I stepped up to order and had a good experience.  The food was average. Good portion size. I had the gyro plate with lamb/beef. It had good flavor, the slaw added a nice crisp to the plate. The couscous could've used a little more flavor but mixed with all the rest of the food on the plate it was fine.  Took some hummus to go and ate for a snack later. The hummus was good, but not nearly enough pita (only one piece) to finish all the hummus they gave me."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and good sized portions for a reasonable price.  Restaurant is clean and you can get through the line quickly."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious gyros!! More of a fast food joint with counter service. Plenty of tables and lots of authentic and delicious foods!"}
{"text":"Very basic and plain.  Nothing special.  Grape leaves are weak, tabouleh (like earlier comment) is not real tabouleh and has zero flavor.  Hummus and pita were ok but again nothing to write home about.  Was really wanting real Mediterranean good but this is more like fast food style.....big names with little flavor/authenticity."}
{"text":"What a find! We were in the area looking for  lunch and Yelp showed This restaurant as near by.   There wasn't a line when we walked in but the daily special on the TV display was very enticing and so we ordered a couple of dishes. - The Greek half chicken and the spinach pie.   The food is very good and the staff were very friendly. Food is so good we went back to order another half chicken to go.   The place is also very bright and simply decorated. Definitely coming back for more meals. Good food, good place, good price. Hard to beat.   Chicken was moist and flavorful. Spinach pie has a nice flaky crust and tasty too."}
{"text":"So so delicious! Reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. Everything was very fresh and delicious from the beef and lamb gyros, to the chicken gyros and the chicken shawarma. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is a good, affordable, independent fast casual Chipotle style Greek restaurant. Enjoyable and glad it's here!  Stop by if you need a quick bite that's different from your typical stop!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Fantastic Greek food for a great price. Will come back again!!!  We had the Lamb and beef gyro, mousaka, veggie pita, and side of falafel. All was fresh and seasoned perfectly!"}
{"text":"I had the beef/lamb sandwich with tzatziki and my wife had the falafel sandwich. It was slightly better than a frozen supermarket Mediterranean meal. This place needs someone to Lean their process; chaos all over. The tzatziki was over garlic with little dill, lemon, or even yogurt flavor. The falafel was dull to the taste buds. The tahini was bland. I wouldn't discourage you from trying, but don't expect anything special. I hope they move to using fresh ingredients and recipes with more rich flavor, rather than blandness that is uninspiring.   Why would anyone open a restaurant to offer bland food which appears very little of the offering is freshly made."}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard, but it makes for a good, reasonably healthy, easy lunch. I ordered online and my food was ready for pick up right on time, I couldn't have been easier. I had the chicken shawarma plate. The chicken was tasty and not dry at all. I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Hey, this is a cool cheap and affordable way to have Mediterranean food! Unbelievably I liked it better than some of the sit-down restaurants in the area! The veggie platter was amazing! We will be going again"}
{"text":"So in my travels to anywhere works takes me on a regular basis, I tend to find comfort foods that draw me back again and again.  Freska is my go-to for Middleton, WI.    Growing up in NY, I feel in love with Greek cuisine.  One of my best buds back home is Greek and she indoctrinated me as to the cuisine, the culture and the Ouzo.  But that's a story for another day. lol  But the humble Gyro...*wistful sigh*   Freska has a wonderful Gyro...but it's the accompanying sides they offer to complete the Gyro platter that got me.  Like five times over 3 trips to WI.  They offer couscous AND rice...tabbouleh...babaganoush....nice Tzaziki...fresh pita...super food slaw...finely sliced sweet onions...and all the usual stuff.  Each time, I tried new sides and each one was wonderful, fresh and tasty.    The food is great, the place is clean and you can get out with a great meal under $12 that you'd be hard-pressed to finish!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Classic Greek Salad with extra Feta and extra Olives. Greek Salad in no rocket science, if you get right products and they are fresher than fresh, all is well. I really enjoy my salad when someone cuts and slices a fresh tomato straight to my bowl. Good Place to go, once and twice and many more times.  If you are a traveller and you trust your instincts."}
{"text":"This is my go-to fast-casual restaurant in the Middleton/west Madison area. I wish there were more Freskas in Madison -- I would frequent this establishment more often than I already do.  As others have noted, this is a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. The food is always fresh and flavorful. I've eaten the classic Greek salad and the veggie plate several times. The veggie plate is full of various flavors and textures and leaves you feeling full even though it includes no meat. The balkava for dessert is good, although not as sweet as I would prefer, but I have a major sweet tooth. The spanakopita comes a la carte, and the portion is plenty big for a few people to share and still enjoy several bites each.  The restaurant offers a lot of food at a pretty reasonable price. I always leave Freska feeling plenty full, even though I didn't pay a whole lot. I've also done carry-out at Freska, and Freska does a good job of filling up the same amount of food in the to-go containers as it would serve on the dine-in plates. I've noticed that some restaurants really skimp on to-go portions. (I'm talking about you, Panera.)  I still feel that Mediterranean Cafe on State Street is the best place in Madison for Mediterranean food; nobody can top the Mediterranean Cafe's to-die-for rice. But with Freska's convenient location, easy parking and quick turnaround time, I find myself going to Freska more often than the Mediterranean Cafe.  I don't feel as though I can give five stars for Freska because not all of the staff people are always friendly. The two people who have made my orders have always been welcoming and accommodating. The cashiers, though, are hit or miss. Sometimes, the cashiers have acted almost grumpy with me; other times, they've been friendly. Also, I have to dock a star because a menu item at Freska comes with \"lettace.\" ... Cringe ...  Even with the bad misspelling, I'll still go back to Freska!"}
{"text":"Yum! Tender chicken schwarma, soft and warm pita, fluffy couscous, tasty spreads...I'm a fan! I got my order to go, but the restaurant is clean/neat and looked comfortable for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch. Stopped in today and had very quick service even over noon-hour. I had the veggie feast - good and fresh. If I worked nearby I'd be here regularly."}
{"text":"Simply delicious, well made Mediterranean food. Good prices and terrific variety. It's sort of fast casual but there's nothing at all wrong with that.  I had the shawarma with harissa which was nice and spicy without kicking my ass. The chicken was really well prepared, flavorful and juicy. The hummus is honestly some of the best I have had.  Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in a long time. Grapes leaves and lamb gyro were so good. Nothing fancy but I always love when the owner (who is from Greece) is working the register.  They serve Chipotle style and line was out the door for lunch. Luckily I snuck in right before the rush."}
{"text":"I usually don't like these places where you have to pick what you want on your meal like Chipotle, but it's worth it here. I had a standard Gyros which was very good with fresh ingredients and very tasty. My wife had a greek salad which was very good as well. It's a little slow and uneven at the counter but the servers are friendly and the owner was there serving as well. Give it a shot when in the area."}
{"text":"Fast casual style restaurant.   Service 5 star: fast and friendly. Ordering online was nice.   Ambience 5 star: nice and new  Food: 3.5-4 star Kabab was quite good. Vegetarian plate was also very good.  The one letdown was the babaganouch, it was down right gross.  It had the consistency of snot. Nasty.   I'd go back...just won't get the babaganouch."}
{"text":"Good all around.  Great, hummus, chicken, and sauces.  The veggie slaw is awesome! Very clean inside as well."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Fresh, delicious, healthy Mediterranean . We go here way too often . Love the plates and the sandwiches ."}
{"text":"This is a cool idea, and my wife and I really enjoyed our first trip there. Like a Greek version of Pancheros, it is super easy to run in for lunch on a short break, customize your dish and be on your way. And while I'm no connoisseur of Mediterranean food, what we ordered was great, flavorful, different and healthy.   My $8.25 beef and lamb gyro plate was a far cry from the typical gyro sandwich with French fries. I picked the couscous over the rice pilaf, hoping it maybe had a slightly better glycemic index, and the sides were great. In addition to the typical tomato and cucumbers, there was a super slaw and spinach and feta cheese. Yum. My wife's tender $10.95 beef kabob was delicious and came with a large, wonderful salad with a great strawberry vinaigrette and other sides.   The staff was helpful and friendly, though they disappeared at one point while I was waiting to ask for another to-go box. The place was clean and well kept. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Solid \"fast casual\" food.  Throw this in your rotation of Chipotle, Potbelly's, etc of fast build-to-order lunch or dinner.  I was here on a Friday night with some friends and it was clean and quiet.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good and priced right.  I've been here twice, so now I have a \"go-to\".  I enjoyed the dinner platter with couscous, falafel, hummus, onion, cucumber/tomato, and feta (comes with pita).  Dine in the first time, carry out the second.  It was consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Got lamb gyro. $7.36 get alot of food for the cost. Didnt get the offered meal (drink and rice or something)"}
{"text":"Think Greek Chipotle! You order a pita, plate or salad, then go down the line, choosing your toppings. Very fast, and quite delicious! Healthy, yummy, fast food in America. How refreshing!   I had the vegetarian feast - hummus was yummy, falafel cooked to order, fresh spinach, tasty tabouleh (which is rather heavy on the bulgar and short on the parsley, but still good), soft pita, and very smoky baba ghanoush (a bit too smoky for me, but that's just me). I'm a saltaholic so thought everything could use a bit more, but that was easily remedied. $7.95 for the feast.   Also ordered a small Lentil soup, which was hearty, though on the sweet side, for $1.95. Hubby got a large soup (which was not that much larger) for $3.95. It was the egg lemon rice soup, and as previous reviewers mentioned, it definitely needs more lemon, though he did enjoy it quite a it anyway. He also got a chicken gyro for $6.95 (does not come with any sides, but you choose from many toppings and sauces to load it up). Loaded with chicken, large, juicy chunks. Tzatziki sauce was very good.   Lots more of the menu to explore. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends for my first visit tonight.  I had the pork kabob platter.  The pork was grilled fresh, and I loved the choice of either brown rice or couscous (I chose couscous).  I loved the tangy tzatziki sauce and the generous portions.  The house made spanakopita is worth the trip!  I'm already planning my next dinner there.  Great addition to Madison!"}
{"text":"This was a great find. I was looking for a healthy alternative to the standard burger spots in the area and stumbled across this place on Yelp. Definitely the best Mediterranean food this side of Banzo! The lamb and beef gyro was excellent, as was the fresh hummus. I also got a small salad with a homemade strawberry vinaigrette dressing that was delicious. The location's track record is not great based on previous tenants, but this is worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"So good, the staff was friendly. The place was clean, Yummy. Fresh. It kindof does remind me of a Greek Chipolte,  but more. We had the spanakopita on couscous with the Greek salad that was delicious,  so was the chicken  shawarma, dolmathes and the soup of the day was a florentine bean that was so good!. The baklava was good, but I prefer it to have more crunch, but otherwise everything was delicious."}
{"text":"It has a gyro spit and mediterranean food made casual, we need more of this.  I had the lamb and beef gyro with hummus, tziziki sauce with tomato on a pita and it was spot on.  I had a side of falafel which was just okay, not very fresh inside.  I'll be revisiting this frequently for my gyro fix and other med options.  They have some nice looking salad options on their menu as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!  My boyfriend and I had the same thing.  A plate with lamb and beef gyro meat, tzaziki and harissa sauce, hummus, tabouli, pita bread, tomato and cucumber salad, brown rice, and feta.  The portions were huge and the food was great!  Wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I went with the wife, I had the falafel Sammy and she had the lamb and beef gyro with fries.  I thought the falafel was very good, nice and crunchy with a solid Tzatziki sauce. My wife thought the gyro was way better than Gyro Express but not as good as Atlantis Taverna. The fries were those standard McDonald's like fries...which means I loved them.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  It is the kind of place where you order at the counter and pay, then sit down. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"With its mall location, you might assume that Freska is a chain or a franchise, but I don't believe that's the case. As a big fan of Mediterranean fare, I've always wished for a fast food or dare I say a Mediterranean McDonald's, so I could get my falafel fix anywhere. Freska comes close, providing a clean and attractive venue with flexible Greek and Middle Eastern choices in a self-service setting. Beer and wine availability is also a good feature.  When you walk in, menus are immediately available by the door. You have a choice of sandwiches, salads, sides and hot meals. the choices are limited, but the combinations of main dishes and sides make for a fun lunch experience. A big feature is a make-your-own salad choice, where the counter staff puts it all together for you. No bumping into other patrons as you might in a regular salad bar. The gyros can be lamb/beef or chicken, and for a change, you can change up the toppings to whatever they have, in lieu of the standard tzatziki/tomato/onion.   The gyros sandwich ($6.99/no fries) was my choice on my first visit, and I went with the traditional topping. The sandwich was fine, not the best I've had. On another visit, I made my own combo platter with sides of Falafel, Hummus with pita bread and grape leaves. Both lunches with a drink came around $9.00, not a bad price for a quick, fresh lunch. It's easy enough to drop the same amount at a fast-food burger joint, except Freska is much healthier.  I'm in sync with Jay N. here to say that I consider Freska a solid 3.5 experience. While nothing really stands out foodwise, the convenience and flexibility for getting a fresh Middle Eastern lunch or dinner is a big draw. It's a comfortable and appealing space and easily maneuvered and self-service joints go. I won't hesitate to make it a go to lunch spot anytime I'm in West Madison/Middleton Mallville."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food... had the tabbouleh salad with shwarama chicken on top. The staff was all friendly and quick service. Restaurant was clean and brought. Nice spot for quick lunch or light dinner."}
{"text":"Nice little quick Mediterranean option. Food is made/served cafeteria style. But I only say this in the most positive sense. There is a great variety of choices and the quality is good. Pricing is affordable if not moderately priced offering a good overall value. While there is ample seating... seems like they do a a lot of carry out business. Falafel is solid.  Gyros are decent. Salads are nice. Chicken is flavorful. This place is easy to overlook given its location... but it's a great option in an otherwise bland corporate landscape."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek food I've had in Madison. I've never seen avgolemono on a restaurant menu before and had to give Freska's a try. I wasn't disappointed! Tasted just my YaYa's it literally brought tears to my eyes. Thankful Freska is here and hoping it will stay."}
{"text":"Such great fresh and yummy food. Service was awesome last night. All workers were so happy and helpful."}
{"text":"Tabouleh salad isn't actually Tabouleh but I still love this place. I have a soft spot for Greek food. :)"}
{"text":"I came here shortly after they opened, then again today, and I can't believe they still haven't figured out receipt printing.   Food is ok for fast Mediterranean. Service is a bit slow, although some of that is customer unfamiliarity with the menu and concept."}
{"text":"May be better depending on what you order. My plate choices were not good. No flavor to the veggie slaw or cucumber tomato. Hummus had too much cumin. Couscous was dry. Beef/Lamb Gyro was ok."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros and kabobs! Service has gotten a lot faster since they opened. This place is great when I want a quick fresh meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Quick service, friendly staff, and delicious food!  Loved my gyros sandwich and babganoush (sp???).  The thing that made this place so special was that I mixed up my order and ordered a steak gyros, when it came out, I realized it wasn't what I wanted and they immediately switched it out for me for a regular gyros.  It was my fault, but they were incredibly customer focused and wanted me to be happy.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulously seasoned chicken kabobs and a nice brown rice with mixed veges are perfect for anyone with Celiac disease."}
{"text":"Decided it was time to try one of Greenway Station's newest eateries.  Saw this described in another review as \"Chipotle for Greek food\" and it's not a bad analogy.  On the night we ordered take out, the patron traffic seemed light but it was early in a Sunday.    The menu is very straight forward and you customize your choices based on a prescribed set of categories and options.  We ordered one Classic Greek Salad and added chicken plus a lamb and beef gyro with a side of sweet potato fries.  The salad ingredients were more than ample and the ratio of \"fixins\" to lettuce was very good.  All of the ingredients were ripe and tasted very fresh.  The Greek dressing was pretty standard but adequate.  The chicken on top is not grilled chicken but rather chicken gyro meat.  My fellow diner said it tasted good and was not overly greasy like some gyro meats can be.  It came with a grilled warm pita cut into quarters that also passed the freshness and flavor test.  This was definitely worthy of four stars.  I ordered the lamb and beef gyro and was pleased by the quantity and quality of gyro meat piled high.  You have a choice of sauces but is there really any other choice than tzatziki?!?  Again the meat wasn't overly greasy and the options for add-ons included about 8 different items.  I went for the standard sliced tomatoes, onions, feta, and tzatziki.  One suggestion to the restaurant in the future is to put the tzatziki on the side for takeout orders.  After a 10 minute drive, the tzatziki had virtually liquified and separated under the heat of the gyro meat.  Lots of other Greek restaurants have learned this lesson along time ago so I hope they learn the same.  The feta tasted very fresh and definitely was not an off the shelf supermarket quality cheese.  3.5 stars for the gyro which could have easily been four had it not been for the sauce miscue.  We had never had sweet potato waffle fries so we ordered a side of those to try.  Unfortunately, we were told that the distributor dropped off the wrong product and they only had standard SP fries.  They were fine but nothing special.  Wouldn't order again but still want to try the waffle version.  Didn't try any dessert items but the baklava did look homemade or at least not frozen off the truck.  Looking forward to trying in the future.    The west side and Middleton is starting to get a better mix of food offerings aside from the chain restaurant paradise it had grown to become.  I hope others support Freska not just because it is a serviceable Greek option (which it is) but to also prove to other local restaurant entrepreneurs that our suburban palates know a thing or two about taking culinary risks like our brothers and sisters on the Isthmus."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place on a regular basis, anxious for a new dining option. Finally Freska is open, although I only knew it because of the previous review on Yelp since there is no mention of it on their Facebook page or official website.... and I had taken a few day break on my drive-by stalkings.   My husband and I both ordered the lamb/beef gyro plate and were pleased with the flavor of the meat and options for veggies, sauces, etc. to go on top.  The portion was very generous, especially for lunch! They have quite a few meat (and non-meat) options to either make a plate out of or assemble in a sandwich, making for a lot of combination options. The veggies all looked very fresh and presented in a way that made me want to order a big salad so I could taste them all.  In addition to our main plates, we tried the falafel side and tried to order the stuffed grape leaves, but they do not have these avaialble yet. I was quite disappointed about that since I love a good grape leaf, but the falafel made up for it.  The falafel side was a very decent portion, good texture, flavor and a great crisp on the outside.  I would have like a bit more of the sauce drizzled over the top.  As a last minute decision I picked up some baklava for dessert.  Overall, it was good, but I do think it could benefit from either a little more of the sugar syrup over the top layers or possibly the top section of phyllo not being as thick.  As is, it was difficult to cut through the top for a bite with my fork. The nut mixture and the bottom layers were delicious, so I ended up just removing the top section all together.   As expected the service is still getting ironed out.  I initially asked what was in the fresh veggie mix for the plates, thinking it would save time from requesting cucumber, tomato, and onion if it was all in the \"mix\".  Unfortunately, it was the guy's first day and he asked about 3 people before finally giving up.  By this point I had clogged up the line a bit -- completely unintentional.    There were also some inconsistencies in my plate being handed over the top to me versus being pushed down the line to the cashier so they would know what to ring up.  Small things, but during a busy lunch period it slowed everything down.   The restaurant itself is very nice, with plenty of seating at either booths or tables. Everything was very clean, bright, and inviting.    Overall, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  It is very refreshing to have a locally owned, yet quick and healthy option for dining out in Middleton.  I love Mediterranean food, so will certainly be checking this place out again in the near future to sample other items on the menu.  While they get their full website up and running, I did find a full menu from a place that did the design of it that you can peruse their offerings on: http://www.coroflot.com/msajdesign/Freska-Mediterranean-Grill-Menu"}
{"text":"My 1st time here!  Excellent Greek Salad!  It was very fresh and wonderful pita bread is served with it!"}
{"text":"My first time here today.  Had the veggie feast.  Just finding a good quality vegetarian selection at Greenway Station was pleasant.  The atmosphere was really nice for a fast food  set up.  The salad was great.  The pita perfect.  The Fallafel was a bit lack luster but overall I'm coming back for seconds.  Really really good food. Great prices.  Definite recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, healthy! As a dietitian I couldn't have been happier to see a place like this open, I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Love the Greek salad! Good size and everything seems so fresh! My BF liked his gyro too!"}
{"text":"My wife , three year old daughter and I tried it for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. Place is clean, walks a fine line between fast food and real food. There's something about ordering at the counter and having your food brought to you on a tray that makes it feel a little less classy. Food was good, we got the chicken gyro plates and my daughter got hummus. Everyone was full and happy. The greek options are limited in Madison but for a simple lunch I recommend this place.   Parents - be warned they don't have a kids menu so don't bring picky kids here."}
{"text":"It's great to hear when folks are coming in,  \"Yum, it smells so good in here!\" Nice to have gyros, chix kabobs, falafel, & waffle fries in Middleton. Variety of seating options where tables can be pushed together for large groups."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side for lunch,  but the made to order gyros are fresh and delicious.  Comes with 4 ingredients included,  extras will cost you."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Unassuming simple appearance with counter top serving but ample seating.  There are generous portions of very fresh food at an extremely reasonable price.  I had tabouleh salad complete with warm, soft pita bread.  I had planned to get lentil soup as well, but the salad was so large that I wouldn't have had room for it."}
{"text":"I've been drive-by stalking this place for months now, anxiously awaiting a fresh food alternative to the burger-fest that is this area.  I work near here, and if I don't bring a lunch, my food options are limited to burgers, fast food burgers, pub burgers...you get the picture.  So hearing that a Fresh-Prepared, Mediterranean style restaurant was going to be opening was music to my ears!  Needless to say...they've been open a little over a week, and I've been here three times (yes, I was that excited!).  Inside, the décor is very nice for a quick-eat place like this.  You can tell a lot of time and pride was put into this place.  Nice booths, tables, and the décor on the walls is unique and interesting.  I was surprised when my husband and I came with our toddler that they only had one high chair, and it was broken (no center strap, so we had to hold our kid in it with one hand while eating with the other or she'd slide right out).  To be broken when they'd only been open a week was strange, but we had bellies full of yummy food, so it wasn't even a big deal (although I'd suggest fixing this before someone who is a little more grumpy and anal about these things gets you in trouble for it!).  Let me get to the food...omg...Salads! Platters! Sandwiches! Soups! It's so nice to have a plethora of vegetarian and vegan options.  So far, I've had the Falafel Plate, the Spinach Pie Platter, and the Greek Salad with Falafel. All were super fresh (the spinach pie was literally coming out of the oven), perfect sized portions. You have a very large selection of fresh and colorful veggies to add to your food, Brown Rice Pilaf or CousCous for your grain, and let's just have a moment of silence in appreciation of their perfectly browned and warmed pita bread...mmmmmm.  This place will definitely be leading me to \"forget\" my lunch at home more often so I can dine here frequently."}
{"text":"I normally save 5 stars for the big hitters, but for a version of quick Greek it was stop on the day we stopped.  I got the veggie sampler.  Everything was super fresh and my falafel was fried fresh.  The dips and sauces were great.  We had a side of chips and fries; go for the chips, they are fresh fried.  My hubby had the gyro, he is not a good sharer.  He said it was very, good and \"hit the spot\" but not as good as Plaka downtown or Atlantis in Sun Prairie, but the best otherwise!"}
{"text":"Fresh, simple, and good! It's not the most delicious Mediterranean joint out there, but it's not fussy, and you leave feeling revitalized rather than bloated like a lot of fast causal places out there. I don't think that I will ever regret coming here, but I don't think I'll ever really crave it either."}
{"text":"A great addition to Middleton offering healthy quick fare.  Counter service platform but really high quality food with great fresh flavors.  They have sit down tables if you want to eat in but we often take it to go.  Their tabouleh is amazing!!!!"}
