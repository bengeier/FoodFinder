{"text":"I would say the best sushi among all the AYCE I've been to so many places such as the one on dundas square, Aji sai, sushi one, naruto and etc this is the best I drive all the way from downtown Toronto to eat here. But recently due to salmon prices rising their salmon pieces are shrinking not only here all other places as well."}
{"text":"Highly not recommended.

1. Sushi rice was as thick as a pillow
2. The sashimi on top of the rice pillow was poorly sliced with rips and tears on it
3. Sushi was warm
4. Waitress didn't even know what they were serving..reminded her our eel sushi hadn't come yet. . And she pointed to a random sushi already on the table and claimed that to be the eel
5. The only thing to compliment was the mango pudding dessert

Overall, ranked lowest of the ayce Japanese restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is my second time going to sano sushi and both times were awful. The sushi is NOT FRESH!! The appetizers are decent, however the sushi (including sashimi, hand roles, sushi roles, etc) ARE NOT FRESH AT ALL. You can literally taste the poor and old quality of their sushi items. 
On top of this - when I told the manager that our plate of sushi did not taste fresh, he stood there and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes, saying that I was WRONG and that our opinion on the food was flawed.

SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to 168 sushi. It's a bit pricier but worth every penny. You can taste the quality in their food and you wont leave disappointed - trust me!!"}
{"text":"I see all the positive remarks but it's not that good.  Service being horrible is fine because it's expect. Food wise,  too much rice and small fish portion sushi pieces.  They use the same over corn starched teriyaki sauce for all their grilled item. I rather they season with only salt and pepper."}
{"text":"My experience at Sano Sushi is one i dread to experience again. Me and my sister went for dinner, got seated immediately, and got our order in promptly.

Me and my sister both commented on the spot that we were sat in- it was in a completely different section of the restaurant. It was a little bit darker and out of the way but we thought nothing of it. 

We had to specify the order MULTIPLE times, but eventually when the food came it was actually pretty good. The Spicy Salmon roll was impressive, as was the red tuna and the freshness of the fish. My personal favourite part of the meal was the salmon roses and the Red Snapper sashimi (freezing cold and fresh, AMAZING)

This is where the experience turned to shit. As we were eating, we noticed the waiters and waitresses seemed to be speaking and laughing a lot in their language, and then looking over at us and laughing. We knew they weren't checking up on how we were doing because they would have walked by and asked, and we knew they weren't checking to see if we need more drinks because i mean, why would somebody laugh at that. Its simply not funny. This seemed fishy to me (no pun intended). Eventually it became so irritating to my sister and I that i looked at them until they made eye contact, and when they made eye contact with me they were about to laugh, but when they saw that i was watching, they stopped in a very guilty looking manor. 

As we were paying for our meal, we noticed another couple had walked in. Just prior to this my sister and I were discussing this odd behaviour and why might it be occurring. They sat the couple next to us when they sat every other person that walked in to the restaurant in the main section. Then I noticed something- 

*****Every single person that was seated in the main section was either Asian or normal white christian. The people that were sat next to us were a couple of two, one indian male, and one jewish looking women. Me and my sister are both born into a jewish family however she looks mexican and i look dark skinned.

I came to the conclusion that this restaurant is racist and anti-Semitic and therefore i will not be returning in the future. 

Food:
6 out of 10

Service:
1 out of 10 (if that)

Overall Experience:
Unhappy and uncomfortable


If you feel like going out for dinner and are in the mood for all you can eat judgment and discrimination, by all means, please feel free to stop by Sano Sushi on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Very reasonable lunch menu for 12 dollar quality and service are good as well the variety of different roll if you are in this area wort to stop and tray"}
{"text":"I called in for take out and they could barely speak English and it was so hard to place my order. The price was the same as everywhere else and the quality was ok though the Salmon Sashimi was not very fresh and the Salmon rolls were extremely oily...

I got takeout so I'm not sure how the service is but I'm not sure if I would go back unless I really have to.."}
{"text":"Environment: The seats are cushioned and really comfortable. I sat there for 3 hours (7:30-10:30) tonight. I didn't even realized I have already sat there for 3 hours, so you can tell how comfortable the seats are hahaha. And the place is nice and spacious.
_________________________________________________________

Service: Thumbs up! Wonderful service. I'm really pleased with their attentiveness!! =)

1. The servers are really attentive:
- Once I sat down, the server came over to greet us and ask if we want to start with any drink (tea or pop)!
- Then during the dinner, when we almost finish the food on our table, the server came over ask if we would like to order more food.
- They would stop by your table from time to time to check if everything is alright, if the food is good, if any order has been missed.

2. The servers are knowledgeable: They know about every dish, they will tell you the names and the ingredients in the roll, they remember everything! The server at other all you can place has no knowledge to the dishes at all, always asked me to wait and they'll go ask the chef. BUT at Sano Sushi, every server can tell you everything about the dishes! They are definitely well trained!

3. The servers are really friendly: They would stop by and talk with you and always have a smile on their face.

Food: 
1. LOVE the avocado eel roll, it taste so good! the avocado melt in your mouth and it blends well with the eel!

2. A huge selection of rolls and most of them are really good: eel avocado roll, dynamite roll, arctic roll...

3. They have red tuna sushi (only at night)! It taste good! 

4. they have huge selection for dessert, and they are ALL SO GOOD: 
- chocolate mousse: STRONG flavour of chocolate! it's a bit TOO sweet for me
- strawberry mousse: STRONG flavour of strawberry! LOVE it! the sweetness is just right!
- mango jelly (its mango pudding but the menu said mango jelly): it taste good!!
- mango yogurt: it's more like tofu fa with mango jam on top, it taste so good!! The \"yogurt\" is so soft, and smooth!
- strawberry yogurt: same as mango yogurt except its strawberry jam on top, also really good!
- coffee jelly: STRONG flavour of coffee! MUST TRY if you are a coffee lover!

5. tried a few hot dishes and didn't really like them. for example the Enoki Beef (enoki mushroom wrapped with beef), the sauce is SOOO sweet, doesn't taste good..

6. the food all came really fast!!

7. the presentation of the sushi are so good! they put the sushi on the boat with a flashing ice cube on it (it changes color oh, green~blue~purple~orange~red..) so pretty!!! just make me smile when I see their beautiful presentation of the food

{"text":"I'd give 0 stars if I could. 1 is a stretch. What disgusting food and horrid service, just down right rude waiters. I'd never recommend this place to ANYONE. Save your money and go anywhere else and trust me when I say it will be better."}
{"text":"I don't get why people are giving this place rave reviews. Sushi rice is overcooked and mushy in the rolls makes the seaweed soft. Sashimi isn't fresh. The waitress was chewing food while serving. So many of our food items did not come. Website says serves oysters on weekends, they do not."}
{"text":"Came here on a day when the power went out. The restaurant was not filled to the door when we went in, so we were a little surprised. I came with three friends, and one of them was a sushi eating fiend.

The fish was fresh, and the cooked food was pretty good. They have a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi. We ordered 50 pieces of salmon sashimi at first, and they did not take us seriously. We got this plate of prettily placed salmon, but it was definitely not 50 pieces. After we finished the first plate, we ordered another 50 pieces of salmon sashimi. Then I think they realised we meant business and served up a platter of big fat pieces of salmon. They didn't bother to make it pretty this time lol.

There's also this item on the menu called crazy tuna roll. We were really curious as to what makes it crazy, and after some speculation, we decided to order it. It was a big fat roll stuffed with a bunch of tuna, then wrapped in tuna. It was a mouthful.

They also have a great selection of desserts. I always get sold on desserts. Especially mango yogurt. Mmmm.

The only reason that I took off a star is that the service was kind of slow. Especially at the beginning when we were super hungry. And they missed some orders that we had to remind them about. Otherwise, would go here again!"}
{"text":"This place had a very good selection on its all-you-can-eat menu.  Service was pretty good.  The fish was very good but the sushi wasn't assembled very well; -- it tended to fall apart.  We probably wouldn't go back as there are better local alternatives."}
{"text":"I'm really hungry right now, and decided to look at pictures of sushi.. despite that i ordered here before and very much like their mango yogurt and ''veggie explosion'' roll ..I'm really hungry right now,"}
{"text":"$12-13 all you can eat lunch. Is it good you ask? This isn't a 3rd world country, you glutton. Be thankful for the opportunity and this review!"}
{"text":"Love this place

1) Extremely fresh and good quality fish
2) HAVE to try their avocado salad, their dressing is very unique
3) Awesome desserts, try their mango yogurt :) 
4) The waiters' services are not bad better than most AYCE"}
{"text":"I took my friend for dinner after a positive experience last time. The waitress we got this time was careless and rude. She barely checked up on us (and others in the restaurant), which could be because it was an evening, but the the place really wasn't that busy. We waited, but half of our side orders (5 different dishes) never came. We didn't have a chance to ask her to bring them because she didn't come near our table. Again this could be because they were \"busy\", but missing half the order is too much. The dishes she remembered, she threw at our table. I didn't expect amazing service, but this was bad. The food that we did get were pretty good, including the fruit sushi(?), but with a service like that, I'll just go to another place. We left wanting for something more."}
{"text":"I went to Sano Sushi with my family yesterday. Our service was shit, no one approached us, the food brought to our table was wrong, at the end of the meal, the man who works there started to yell at us for wasting food and decided to charge us 10$ for a salmon sushi hand roll that was slimy and he was charging us for the food that wasn't even ours to begin with. He started to yell and treat us like shit, which was very rude and unprofessional. We found hair in our dishes, we saw rats (dead rats in the corner near where they prepare the food.) When leaving we saw puke at the front door and all of a sudden the rude asian man who works there started to scream at us for puking when no one puked in my family. He ran to our car where my sister had to open her mouth to show him she did not puke AND HE WANTED US TO CLEAN IT UP!  - Never Again - unless you want to be treated like shit and eat unsanitary food and to be laughed at by the waiters and waitresses with the worst service and give your money to a shit whole, by all means go there. We all felt sick on the way home. Worst experience ever! Bathrooms were full of garbage and food on the floor. The pop machine fucking was disgusting and flat.  If I could rate them, I would personally close them down. If you want good all you can eat sushi DONT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"the staff were a bit slow even though it wasnt busy. the food wasnt so bad but could have been better. i always try different places but wasnt very happy with sano sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered \"Sushi Tokyo\" and Tom Yum soup.  The Surimi had an \"off\" smell and the fish used for sushi were so stale that they were literally dry and chewy!  When I tried to clean my palate with the ginger, it turned out that even the ginger was on preservative steroids!

Never again (from here)..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice prior and now I see some cost cutting being introduced;  the garlic mushrooms are finely sliced to little bits instead of them being served in halfs, my garlic beef was chopped again into very small chunks and made tataki raw? (i sent it back to be re-cooked), and really I was not getting good service at all that night.  I had to find someone for tea fill-ups in an empty restaurant!

Sano Shrimp a signature fried shrimp dish with spicy sauce was disappointing, the inside shrimp tasted cold but the outside warm batter warm and fried. The place was pretty good when I first started coming but this last time wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Tasted like bargain bin fish. Tried some of it. Couldn't even eat 4 pieces - threw all if it away. It also smelled pretty bad. You had one job. To make sushi. And you can't even get that right, Sano sushi. 

If I get food poisoning, you know who'll be knocking on your door soon."}
{"text":"Personally I wouldn't dine here but I always grab some takeout. It's truly the best bang for your buck if you're looking to get full. Pay in cash, you save 30% if you order takeout!!! 

Before 3 p.m. you can grab a lunch bento for around 7.14 with tax!! Bentos come with rice, salad, 3 pieces California rolls, and miso soup. Super filling. The food isn't the best jap, but for its price it's good when you're really hungry cause it's very fulfilling. Like you can get a full bento for same price as a McDonald combo.

{"text":"Sushi was mediocre. Service was awful. The staff look like they hate their jobs. Orders did come for an hour or more. Some items were forgotten about. Would never come back here again."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in GTA ! (Coming for 5+ years and have tried 10+ other AYCE sushi places)

$22.99 (mon-thur) and 23.99 (fri-sun) dinners ( i have only gone to dinners)
+ cash (10%off)
They let you have the dinner menu ANY time of the day so you can have the more luxurious menu at lunch as well. 
- Includes pop 
- 100+ foods
- Dim sum (never seen at other AYCE sushi places)
- Larger selection of sashimi (has more than just the basics)
- LARGE selection of sushi, hand rolls, maki rolls
- Has more expensive dishes like (salmon belly, calamari, avocado salad, dim sum, oyster, red tuna sushi, shrimp (all kinds), mussels, grilled saba. As well as tataki sashimi!)
- Large dessert selection, most AYCE sushi just give you ice cream. 

Service is amazing, just ask the server if you have any special requests or substitutions. Most of all the fish is fresh! The sashimi has always been the best i've tried."}
{"text":"The WORST sushi ever! Supermarket sushi would be better! Don't know how people give good reviews. Horrible service, awful food, rolls are HUGE (filled with rice). Not too much selection compare to other AYCE sushi. The only good thing is ice cream.first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"I had the sashimi and I got frozen ones. They were frozen in the middle and when I asked why it is frozen they had told me that it isn't and walked away..."}
{"text":"First long story short, I came here because we were around the area and needed a sushi place to eat at. 

I saw the decent rating and decided to forego reading the reviews because I was too hungry at that point to care (boy, would I come to regret that decision). 

This place still uses the traditional pencil and paper, but I really really think they should invest in the iPad ordering system. It'd probably prevent the problems I experienced here that I will discuss below. 

Before I get into my extremely long rant, I will say the food is okay here. The sushi is larger than other places, but that definitely does not make it better. The red tuna sushi was the stand out though. Considering we went on a weekend night, some of the sashimi pieces were dinky af. Consistency is key. The baked mussels were so rubbery and bland, I don't even know how I managed. Overall, most of the things I ate were well below par. 

Service was prompt, but decent, and not only once or twice or thrice but FOUR times they've delivered the wrong food to us. And there were plenty orders that we were missing. The first item they wrongly delivered to us was the volcano roll, which was this disgustingly deep fried sushi roll nobody wanted. We flagged down one waitress and told her, but she disappeared. So we flagged another one down, who went to go check our order. She comes back and quickly waves our sheet at us and says we did order it.. We barely got to see the sheet, but then we were beginning to doubt ourselves so we just forced ourselves to eat the roll since we didn't want to be charged an excess for waste. 

Moving on from that, we placed an order for our second round and then comes this plate of tofu on our table. At this point, we were extremely confused because were we mistakenly marking  stuff on the sheet or were they just carelessly punching through the orders we've placed? 

I got my answer to that question as they tried to deliver a plate of french fries and spring rolls to our table. Like seriously. As if I would order french fries at ayce sushi. The moment the dishes hit our table, I told the waitress we did not order that. She looked confused and went away with the dishes and never came back. 

When it was time for dessert, we carefully took our time to check off what we wanted and didn't even dare to go over the allotted space for fear of getting another round of sushi, french fries and tofu at our table. As one last precaution, we marked a line over the rest of the sections to make sure they knew dessert was all we wanted. 

Lo and behold, the waitress comes to deliver a plate of deep fried bananas nobody ordered to our table before being told something else by another waitress and leaving with the plate. Pretty much left speechless at this point. If they didn't spend so much time delivering the wrong food to us, maybe they could've actually delivered the food we wanted but didn't receive. 

My experience was memorable for all the wrong reasons and needless to say, I will not be back. Stay away from this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Best food here is Kalbi.  The rest of their dishes are generic.  I highly recommend, due to the price of short ribs, you go in and order boat loads of Kalbi and maybe some veggies for digestion.  The rest is just MSG saturated foods.  Forget about the staff, they treat you like a leper."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places to go to!!! unfortunately I live far from it but if I get the chance to pass by here, I'm coming in! We were greeted quickly and set to our seats. Service is fast. Large selection of dishes, rolls, desserts and drinks to choose from! I was surprised because most, if not all AYCE sushi places don't have this option for pop otherwise you're just given water/tea. You also get %10 off if you pay with cash, how can you resist this place?! I'm in love. This may be weird but for the salad lovers, I always get a small salad and the dressing at other places is either too watery or too thick and strong. The sauce here is perfect! The rice to fillings are perfect ratio. I love their enoki rolls, sashimi was fresh and sliced to a generous amount. Their battered and fried dishes came out HOT! I can go on and on and on.. I'm so happy with this restaurant! Expecting more future visits :)"}
{"text":"A white people Japanese wannabe joint.

You get 10% off if paying by cash.

Great if you are looking for a system flush. Nothing beats having all you can eat Japanese  then spending hours on the toilet after.

Do not expect nice decor, it's more like a diner style.

On the flip side, they do have a good variety of choices.  
Staff are friendly.
Non- alcoholic drink comes free with meal.
Do not order the takala-whatever version of sashimi."}
{"text":"I can't really complain about the average-quality food. This place is an affordable all you can eat Japanese restaurant that provides you with a wide variety of asian food from sushi to teriyakis, salads, soups, and desserts for a very low price. Their waitresses are helpful and polite and delivery of food is pretty fast. I would recommend this place, but lower your expectancy."}
{"text":"Good buffet for a very cheap price. they do not have the best service but its ok. i come here once a month (don't judge me) and anyone that i showed this place to have also fallen in love with it"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi in the area. The sushi is presented beautifully and ordering system is quick and efficient. They will even make something up that is not on the menu.  The atmosphere is relaxed and updated. There are numerous sitting areas that allow some privacy and some tables completely private."}
{"text":"I visited Sano sushi for dinner and had an okay experience.

The service: 5 stars
The food: 2 stars
The ambiance: 3 stars
Parking: 2 stars

I arrived at the restaurant to meet my friends and I was the last to arrive. It took our waiter over 10 minutes to come back to the table to take my order. Once he arrived he was fantastic. I knew I needed to order sooner than later since I have a bunch of food allergies.

I ordered sushi rolls, edamame, sashimi and some grilled items. The grilled items were the best thing I ordered. I opted for the grilled squid, asparagus wrapped in bacon and grilled mushrooms. These items went down easy and tasted fantastic. When I ordered more they didn't always arrive and I was stuck with the less fresh items like the salmon sashimi. 

The salmon sashimi was not fresh. It tasted off and did not melt in my mouth. I didn't want to eat it but at this restaurant you get charged for what you don't eat. Talk about having a dilemma. Hehe 

The next day, I had a fishy aftertaste in my mouth. It was equivalent to the experience I encountered when I used to take omega 3 pills (let's just say I only lasted a week). 

This restaurant has good service! The employees are so friendly and kind but I would not return for the food. The only exception would be if my friends choose it again for a party but I might suggest someplace new for all of us to try."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year now to satisfy my on and off sushi craving. Service is always fast and the food is tasty! Favourite is the green dragon roll."}
{"text":"We often go to Sano Sushi for a dinner, and have to say, they serve one of the most delicious sushi in Toronto/GTA. Besides the traditional well-known sushi recipes such as Salmon rolls, Philadelfia, Dragons, California etc, they serve something special: try their Arctic Roll with rice \"paper\" or Boston roll or Pink Lady roll. The other dishes are great as well. Love their short ribs, asparagus with pork, shrimp tempuras to name a few.  The place is nicely decorated with crystal balls. The wall tables are good for romantic dinner. However, book in advance, as the place becomes very crowded after 7pm."}
{"text":"May i also add, since 2 years ago when i started going, ive introduced many of my friends to Sano & it has become every single ones favourite place? 
You're Welcome Sano ;D
But most importantly, Thank YOU for the amazing food"}
{"text":"This is yet another AYCE sushi place. I've tried a million in the GTA and this one compares favorably. There are some flaws but it's a strong contender for future visits. 

Pros:
-Clean & attentive service, unlike a lot of other places. Fills my tea promptly. Checks on us often. Doesn't forget our items
-Decent menu selection. Dessert is more than other places. They have mousse cake and some jelly.
-Teppanyaki shrimp here is the next level. Shrimps were HUGE.
-Beef skewers were the highlight of the meal
-Tataki version of white tuna and salmon sashimi. 
-The rolls were excellent. I had arctic, double dragon, and monkey roll. Not too much rice.
-They provide soft drinks.
-Tempura chicken and fish katsu are things I haven't seen before in AYCE sushi. The chicken was a very tender piece of chicken breast. 

Disappointments:
-While I like red tuna sushi, they cut it way to thin. If you're going to cheap out on it and give me lots of rice, I'd prefer you just took it off the menu. Other sushi weren't as bad but the fish-rice ratio isn't up to my standard.
-Sano Shrimp was awful, especially for a dish that has the restaurant's name.
-Mackerel sashimi was heavily salted. 
-The teppanyaki squid didn't feel like teppanyaki. It felt like stir fried squid. 

It's $22 for weekday dinner buffet. 10% off if you pay cash. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a little Japanese restaurant that serves all your typical Japanese buffet food including sushi, maki rolls, teppanyaki, tempura, salad, katsu, handrolls, and desserts (and also with Chinese, Thai, and Korean options too).

This was my first time here and I enjoyed the food!  The selection was plentiful and the food arrived quickly and without anything being missed.

I especially liked the curry chicken katsu (comfort food!), yakitori (which had amazingly tender chicken), seaweed salad, green dragon roll, cheese mango maki (who would have known that cheese and mango would work so well together?), mushroom teppanyaki, chocolate mousse, and salmon sushi.  The cheese wonton was good too and had gooey cheese melting out of it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Its the weekend and I was looking for an all you can eat sushi lunch with a reasonable price so I grabbed my trusty phone and looked for a sushi place close by. I called them and I was informed that lunch is $13.99 and last till 3:30pm. The place is pretty nice from inside and feels like you are at an expensive restaurant. But its not!! Service was pretty good considering that the place was packed. They did miss few orders that we made so we reordered. Huge selection for lunch and even more for dinner. But don't get carried away with ordering as they will charge you for any wasted food. So make sure to invite that friend of you who is a \"bottomless pit\" I will surely come here again."}
{"text":"Service is extremely poor and very unorganized.  No greetings and smiles from waitresses.  Food is fair and location is ghetto.  Definitely won't return the next time."}
{"text":"Nice AYCE Japanese restaurant with fresh sashimi, including ika and maguro.  I have visited here twice and will say the quality of the hot food is uneven--the first time the deep fried items had too much batter and the second time the items were lightly battered."}
{"text":"A typical All You Can Eat sushi place.
Good: 
The sashimi is fresh and waiter/waitresses are very attentive

Con:
The rice in the rolls are simply not up to standards, it's very sticky, and the filling is not high quality. The meat/fried items are not very fresh and ill prepared. 



If you just want some sashimi, and generic AYCE to fill your belly, this place is very nice. However, if you are looking for very good rolls/cooked beef/fried appetirzers, avoid this place"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a perfect review because of the quality of service and food. I don't have hug expectations with AYCE sushi. I feel like if you've been to one, they're almost all the same. Some perks for the different ones. One thing I want to know is if my sashimi is fresh (as fresh as it can get for AYCE). After having narruto sushi in Richmond hill (which I don't recommend at all), this was definitely a refreshing change. 
I come here for lunch and I love it. Sushi is prepared well with good quality! The service is point on! There's this one server, she's really cute and quiet, I want to just her a hug everytime I see her! She takes care if me and she's so sweet. 
I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed. Love their salmon cheese roles!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. Very nice service and the food is very flavourful. Not too salty and they use really delicious sushi rice, unlike other sushi places which use regular rice sometimes."}
{"text":"First time going here.  Was weary after seeing bad reviews.  This place is awesome!  Their ayce is great value and the food is delicious. Nothing bad to say here. Atmosphere was nice, place was clean, and food delicious. Server was fast and friendly. This is my new to go place. For birthdays. I will keep trying other ayce but this one has set a new standard. Met all my expectations."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a few times a year for as long as I can remember and the food and service has stayed consistently great. This restaurant is located within a plaza just north of Yonge and Clark, so there is plenty of parking. It does get quite busy on weekends, but there's plenty of tables. Lunch buffet on weekends is about $15 (there used to be a cash discount, but that's only for dinner now). $15 for lunch buffet is comparative to other sushi places in the GTA, but this place includes unlimited pop, a wide selection of dessert, and sashimi and other salmon items for lunch.

The inside of this restaurant is quite clean and there's a TV to watch the new. Staff is always very friendly and happy to help you make decisions on what to order. There are the few times when you have to re-order something because it never came, but that's fine. The menu is quite extensive, so take advantage of it and try a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"It was great. Fast and nice service. The food was amazing. A really good AYCE, definitely am coming back. Lots of items to choose from, especially the desserts were awesome"}
{"text":"My favourite All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant. 
Every time it has been fresh, consistent and tasty. Sano has a great variety of food from dim sum (delicious Har Gow/ Shrimp Dumpling) to varying sushi rolls and delicious Wakame and Crab salad (must order). I highly recommend this place for both lunch and dinner, it's really worth it!"}
{"text":"Food-wise: the sushi was made with super \"watery\" rice, can definitely tell its just ordinary rice and not Japanese rice, one of the worst ones I've had in a long time. I enjoyed their mango pudding though.
Service-wise: not sure if its because we sat really close to the kitchen/bar area, we got our needs attended relatively quickly, although they did deliver dishes which we never ordered.

 Quick tip: \"10% off if paid by cash\" was stated on their website but no where to be found on their menu. We wanted to pay by cash to save 10%, however on the bill they assumed that we were paying by debit/credit until we asked. So make sure you tell them beforehand!

I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for good quality or freshly made sushi, its just a really typical AYCE place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Bento box meals tastes actually ok. 

Salmon teriyaki - tougher than what I had desired hence not a 4 star or higher

Udon noodle soup was ok. Nothing really that stood out. Tastes at par with Smart Cook in Markham though Smart Cook's soup base seem more flavourful (and no or little msg as I don't get the usual getting-so-thirsty effect of msg). 

Try the beef bento as my kids seem to enjoy that more and didn't bother getting more of my salmon. 

Chicken katsu was quite acceptable though Nak Won's katsu is a clear winner compared to this. 

Lots of space here with room for a reservation of up to 20 people. 


Sushi was ok but not spectacular. Worth a try but not a place I would go out of my way to dine in."}
{"text":"Time visited : Monday afternoon at 2pm. 
Atmosphere: modern-casual meets elegant. 
Cleanliness: tables and chairs/benches are kept clean. disposable chopsticks! 
Constructive criticism: The Wakami salad should be a larger portion, and the Salmon Sashimi should be cut larger too. I wish there was steamed egg on the menu. Their Bulgogi dish should have more beef. Their Sweet & Sour sauce is very sour and is definitely not the typical sauce you see at other Asian restaurants.
Cuisine: Japanese.
Facilities: I did not use their facilities.

{"text":"I usually get lunch take-out. Always been great, fresh and tasty, for an amazing price! My rating is for the takeout experience. You get A LOT of good food for your money.
Tip: pay cash for $discount"}
{"text":"The food here is ok and service is pretty slow. We ordered too much but the server did not charge us extra which is a plus. My husband and I would not come back here again.  Server did not check on us and waited for our food for so long"}
{"text":"I've been to a few AYCE and this place was a disappointment.
However on a positive stance, the location is central, plenty of parking. The interior has spacious seating  and the overall ambiance is clean.
In terms of service, nothing to complain about! :)
DID WELLS:
Dragon roll was delish, plenty of avocado which really made this dish shine.
Wakame salad was something I've never had, and it was quite enjoyable.
Salmon flower, beef short ribs, tempura, miso soup, fried fish cakes, fried tofu were all good. Please also note their buffet also includes two dim sum items: ha gow and sui mai.
For those with a sweet tooth, they've got a great selection of desserts, and soft drinks are included!! 

OPPORTUNITIES:
-Teppanyaki shrimp was a stir fry because it had a ton of vegetables that was unnecessary.
-Spicy crispy salmon sushi was very dry which I found quite odd
-Sashimi salmon did not taste fresh.
-Enoki beef, there was very little enoki inside.
-Red tuna though good, had way too much rice, not balanced......
Would I come back? Probably not as there are many sushi places out there to try."}
{"text":"used to come here almost every week but then everything started going downhill. The sushi isn't fresh, the place seems very unclean and don't even get me started on the service. The worse possible customer service you could get. I stopped going here a while ago and that says a lot for a regular customer."}
{"text":"Sano sushi used to be amazing but I can definitely see the cost cutting coming into effect. The salmon sashimi used to be cut nice and big - super fresh but now is cut into smaller pieces, not as fresh as before.

The sushi doesn't seemed crammed with rice but looks half-assed.

Service is still quick and the servers are quick to offer you a refill with your drink.

There is no 15% discount anymore.
Bottomless drinks and dessert are still included in the lunch and dinner.

I would still give the place another shot because I did come during a snowstorm, so that could've been why things were a little off.

3/5"}
{"text":"One of the better ayce sushi spots in the richmond hill/thornhill area. I have been here several times and the sashimi is always fresh. 
Nothing special about the customer service. 
A few items to try in my opinion: garlic beef, salmon sashimi, cheese wontons, black dragon, general tao chicken, shrimp tempura, and chocolate and strawberry pudding. They also include pop in their ayce price. 
The price is quite competitive compared to some of the other places in the area and they offer a 10% discount if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"I have visited this place last Sunday based on reviews and unfortunately it did not meet my criteria, food was just okay, waiters were friendly and i dint mind leaving nice tip. In addition salmon did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"I got sushi delivered twice to my home and both times the sushi was delivered in less than 30 min. Sushi was fresh and well made, but the edamane had random bits of tofu which makes me think if they gave us leftover edamane from other people's tables....

Lady on the phone had extreme difficulty speaking English and I had to repeat my phone number 5 times before she got it right. 

Its a decent sushi delivery service, probably will order from Sano again."}
{"text":"In the last 10 years or so this is the second incarnation of a sushi place in this exact location. Both places just also happened to be AYCE. 

I find a lot of sushi AYCE places start out strong but towards their end, they slowly but surely go downhill. Usually the service starts to go downhill then the food follows, then the hunt for the next great sushi place begins anew. So is the life cycle for an AYCE sushi joint it seems in the GTA.

This place though seems to have a little bit more staying power I largely suspect due to the fact that the owner always seems to be around. Ever since the place first opened there is always a gentleman there. At first I assumed it was just the usual owner/manager keeping things in check then moving on to other things. But over time I noticed that nearly every time I went here, this same owner was doing something different. He would be making sushi one day, cleaning tables and serving the next. A few times I went here and didn't see him and thought he's finally taking a day off, but half way through my meal lo and behold I see him come out of the kitchen with an apron on I assume as he also cooks!

It goes a long way for me when I see the owner/manager wear so many different hats. Having said that, it's a great plus to see him around as when he is I know that I will be getting exactly what I ordered.

This place has menus where you can check off what you want on a piece of paper unlike a lot of newer places with their iPad. 

The menu is a very good variety of your standard fare AYCE sushi. If you have a huge craving for great sushi I don't hesitate to recommend this place, as they are very consistent in what they deliver each order and each time i go.

Other places, the first order may be great but after that, the sushi pieces can slowly become stuffed with more rice (filler) and less meat. Portions start to get smaller each order and eventually it will look like they just threw pieces together. A pretty standard tactic for AYCE that tells you you have over stayed your welcome, but I never saw the food quality degrade during a meal here. And having been here a number of times I can say whole heartedly that they are very consistent.

I would say this place is a very solid 3.5 star out of 5. This is still an AYCE, so keep your expectations in check as it's not an omakase meal here.

But for an AYCE sushi place, this is probably one of the more consistent spots in the GTA. And with all the AYCE sushi places coming and going, it says a lot when someone says that this place is consistent in their food.

Though be forewarned the service can be spotty, and mixed up orders do occur.

Again its an AYCE place, so I can't say it's the best ever, but it definitely hits the spot when i have a craving for an AYCE sushi.

TIP: Bring cash as their is a 10% discount if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend for the first time.  Used to go to VIP whIch was there before, which wasn't bad.  This place does not even deserve a star, therefore it will not get one.  Service is almost non existant.  We ordered several dishes on our first order.  Came to our table with the wrong order on many occasions.  I guess they figure as long as you get some resemblance of sushi, you will be happy.  Wh
e we ate this substandard crap, and tried to order some different selections of seafood sushi, dirent from the sewer system of Markham, we waited 20 minutes, and nothing nor anyone came to our table.  When we finally got the attention of one of the employees, we told her to just give us the bill.told her this was by far, the worst experience we have ever had and we go for sushi almost weekly.  Asked to see a manager.  So sorry, no Manager working tonight.  I believe he was hiding in the alleyway behind the restaurant.  I'm sure we were not the first to complain.  If you want sushi, go to one of the many, many sushi places in Vaughan. If you want lousy sushi, go to the curb of your home,  and I'm sure something better than this place will swim in your sewer system.  STAY AWAY at any cost."}

Pros:
Lots to choose from in AYCE menu
Pretty good prices

Cons:
Portion sizes vary differently per order

I never get reviews for AYCE restaurants that compare them to their non AYCE brethren.  You can't compare the 2 honestly.  If you come to Sano Sushi with realistic expectations, you will be just fine.

Sano is your typical AYCE sushi joint.  This place is much bigger than it seems from the outside.  There are many tables inside that can seat large parties if needed.  Dinner Friday to Sunday costs $24.95.  That's already a pretty good price compared to other places.  If you pay in cash you 10% as well!  Yay!!

Sano offers a lot on their AYCE menu. There are many categories to choose from.  It seems like pop is also included on the menu which is a rarity but something nice. This place is run by Chinese people so there are come Chinese type dishes on the menu as well.  The sushi is what you would expect from an AYCE joint. It's decent but nothing special, which is right where it should be.  If you expect the highest quality here you're out of your mind.   

The portion sizes here are all over the place.  One order the sashimi is one size, the next it's twice the size.  Sometimes they don't even follow the the number of pieces they have listed on their menu per order.  More food is usually not a bad thing but when they charge you for unfinished portions it can throw you off.  

All in all, Sano is a pretty decent AYCE sushi joint.  It does it's job at a very good price.  If you want omakase type sushi, you will need look elsewhere.  Come in with the expectations of an AYCE joint, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"They have the best value for all you can eat! Which includes 2 dim sum items :)

They include pop in their price which alot of places charge extra for!

Best bang for your dinner buck"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, excellent food, the servers are very helpful in making your selection. I come here every time of a sushi good time need I say more."}
{"text":"This is an AYCE place with a good selection of Japanese food and dim sum.  We have been here a few times for lunch which we always enjoy.  The sushi is not great but we really like the hot dishes here like the grilled eggplant, beef ribs, and tempura.  We also like the unagi with avocado and spicy salmon crunch hand rolls.  We also really like the crabmeat salad which is really refreshing mixed with cucumber, fish roe and mayo. Overall, its great for its value at $14.95 for all you can eat lunch including soft drinks.  I've been here for dinner once but was a bit disappointed so my review is only for lunch."}
{"text":"This is what I consider a good version of the typical sushi places you can find around the area. The service is usually quick to start and pricing is reasonable (we spent $75 for all you can eat for the5 of us).  

Good quality is quite good and we all left full and happy. Overall a good choice to go with friends or family. If you're looking to impress a date or business partner you should look elsewhere. 

I give it a 8 out of 10 based in food and price."}
{"text":"I ordered from Sano Sushi last night using SkipTheDishes.
The order was confirmed after about 5 minutes, and it was delivered within 35-40 minutes, so it was fast enough.
The tempura was not good at all, i only had few bites and couldn't finish the appetizer portion. The breading on the shrimp was too light and tasteless, it was also over done and way over-fried! The vegetables tasted old and barely had any tempura breading on them.
The edamame were ridiculously bad! My favourite app is the edamame wherever I go, however, I inly had 4 or 5 of this one, And it did it for me! No taste, no texture, seemed old 100%, no salt, nothing! 

As for the rolls, the shrimp roll didn't taste good at all, overpowering fish-eggs a d seaweed taste, while the only thing that tasted good was the spicy california rolls.
Smaller portion/roll size compared to competition, but charging premium prices.
I paid $40 for the above order as in the photos attached! Absolute rip-off for a tasteless bunch of items. I will not re-order from here, there are much better options nearby!"}
{"text":"Everything that served here at Sano Sushi are drowned in some kind of orange sauces and gravy.

I know I am in one of those AYCE Japanese nightmare when I saw my salads.. especially my Wakame salad that looks like a soup?

My Red Tuna sushi looks so red just like one of those plastic fake one that used to decorate display windows, I really feel like I am falling deeper and deeper in this bad dream...

Fried Fish Cake? that looks like a solid cube with a funny texture...and I think this tasted like the exact same sauce that is on my cold Grilled Salmon Neck?

Why are the Sano shrimps (deep fried breaded shrimps) so cold and more orange sauces on top of them?!

I just cannot do this anymore... at least the green tea ice cream bring me back to reality... 

15% off if paying cash... But I don't think this is enough incentive for me to come here ever again!"}
{"text":"Really great place for all you can eat the sushi tastes better than in most places on vaughan. Pretty satisfied over all and this is my new all you can eat favourite. Much tastier than 168 and more variety too."}
{"text":"A very good all you can eat sushi spot! I like that they have Salmon Rose for lunch, and they offer red tuna nigiri for dinner (they also have sashimi for dinner, just not red tuna). In general, all the items are quite good, and have a good rice to fish ratio. Once in a while the red salmon comes out a bit on the cold side (almost frozen one time) but outside of that everything has been great. Definitely our go-to in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming here very often since it's opened and have never been disappointed with the food and service. 

Prior to Sano sushi, there was also an all you can eat sushi restaurant owned by Koreans at this location called VIP Sushi but I stopped coming because of the price and their menu did not justify their high cost.

Ever since Sano sushi opened last year, business has been booming for the owner, Ryan. They have an excellent selection for lunch all you can eat and have recently added two dim sum items! (shrimp dumplings and siu mai) 

I highly recommend this place for lunch (and dinner) as it has a huge selection on their menu and offers items like dim sum, shrimp tempura and green dragon roll that some places only offer for dinner.

The best part of this place is that the prices don't change whether it's a weekday or weekend. Prices for adult lunch is 12.95 and adult dinner is 20.95.

The only negative I would say about this place is the fact that they forget to input some of your order but I have yet to go to an AYCE sushi restaurant that has had my order perfect."}
{"text":"Since this location changed over to Sano Sushi, the quality has gone up tenfold. The food is great, the drinks are refillable, and the staff are all nice. I have gone here with family and friends and they all really enjoy the food.

Some of the previous reviews have been silly and insulting. Please go and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place was called VIP Sushi before and was run by some Korean people. They were doing OK but I guess they sold the joint. Sano is basically the same as the predecessor and the same as the slew of AYCE sushi joints that popped up everywhere in the GTA. 
The place is average at best because it is an AYCE. Thin pieces of fish present on wads of rice and salty cups of soup. I don't frequent these places but for a lunch group, the fixed prices makes the awkward bill thing go away.
My \"Average\" rating on this place is there because it is an average AYCE place. Otherwise the score would be lower."}
