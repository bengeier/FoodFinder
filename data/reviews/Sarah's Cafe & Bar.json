{"text":"Our second time at Sarah's.  First, the food was excellent.  My wife's mussels were excellent , calamari  was cooked perfectly, jerk wings had a fresh jerk sauce that was wonderful.  Where it fell down was with the service.  My beer glass was empty when food arrived and when they were taken away, without an inquiry on a refill.  Bread did not accompany the mussels and was only only offered at the end of the meal.  Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and carefully prepared. But I can't get past the filth of the washrooms. Hygiene is key!!!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, terrible service and average overpriced food.  I've been there a few times before for beers.  But this time I came with my wife and 4 month old daughter , we wanted to sit in the patio, it wasn't a busy time. From the start the waitress made us feel un welcomed , there was plenty of room for the stroller but she wanted to force us into a spot right in the sun. We refused and took a better spot, after that she proceeded to make complaining remarks about it at 4 different times and that was before I got my beer! She made us feel so uncomfortable that we left before the beers got there, I went inside to speak to a manager, but there wasn't any. I told the chef that they lost my business because of her, he didn't seem to care, the waitress saw us leave and she didn't care either. Hopefully the owner won't again erase this review, avoid at all cost. Much better choices out there."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but very overpriced for the quality of food. Taco Trio was pulled pork sopping in super sweet bbq sauce, chicken in an inedible amount of another strong sauce, then a fish taco with zero trace of flavour outside the cilantro leaves. I really wanted to like this place because there are so few options on this end of the Danforth, but was sadly disappointed. Will not go back for food other than brunch."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this weekend (Saturday) and wasn't all impressed with Sarah's. I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon  and the English muffin wasn't toasted well enough so it all tasted soggy. Also in just found it very bland - it looked good but had no substance or taste!  Disappointing because I love brunch and it was just a wasted outing food wise. My hubby and I both commented afterwards about how we left there feeling hungry!  It came out to about $35 for the two of us (food plus coffee)."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Once on a Thursday and on a Saturday. Both times food was less than flavorful but not horrible. The killer for me was seeing the cook take his cell phone out of his pocket, texting then returning it back in pocket and continue cooking. They have a large beer selection however I prefer cognac or a nice brandy.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend acouple of months ago. It's right by my house and we said hey why not. The place was packed when we got in I believe it was a Friday or Saturday. Staff was friendly but they seems overworked. Like they needed someone else on the floor. The kitchen is in the middle and from the high table we were sitting at we could see into it. Which I don't mind. It's better to be able to see what's going on with your food. We got muscles wings and ribs. Muscles were extremely tasty and they have a wide variety of flavours to choose from. The wings and ribs were good and the sauce was very tasty. While they have a small menu they have good options. But I'm giving this place a 3 star because their prices are way too high.  They're at danforth east  in a neighbourhood full of families. Not in a downtown location! There good was good but not good enough to charge those prices.   I also tried the pad Thai one other time. Surprisingly good for a non Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here twice, and both times the food was awful, verging on inedible. Nice ambiance, and I would return for drinks only, but will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with friends. The food was fantastic, I really enjoyed the mussels. Cozy bistro, unhurried, warm service from staff. Shall definitely return."}
{"text":"I want to be a regular here.  the atmosphere is great.  the beer selection is likely the best in the area.  the service is usually excellent.  but there is a limited vegetarian selection, the food rarely meets my expectations and I feel that dinner is overpriced.  Perhaps it's just more than I usually want to spend on a regular basis.   As for the details: My husband loves the mussels, which come with a   variety of toppings.  I think the best thing I've tried is the falafel platter. Brunch had a good selection, with decent prices, but the eggs were unremarkable and the potatoes quite oily.  The patio is beautiful.  I'm sure I will be back to Sarah's often, drawn in by the beer and warm atmosphere...hoping that it will surprise me."}
{"text":"Wandered in to Sarah's Saturday evening around 8PM and there was a good crowd.  Having been here a couple of times before, the main draw is the beer selection. Excellent selection of brews both on tap and in the bottle.  However, Sarah's has never wowed me with their food.  Mussels w/ garlic & cream were nice but quite gritty in spots (a hazard of mussels but also lends itself to a hasty debearding/rinsing in prep).  Mains of gnocchi and phad thai left a lot to be desired.  My date and I were not in the best of moods but the food was still below par.  This is the second time at Sarah's in the last 2 years where the best part of the meal was the drinks.  Definitely a spot for a bevy or two but stick to the apps menu."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great. Friendly service. Food was OK but pricey for what you get. A good go-to spot for beers - you can do better elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was decent but the food wasn't very good. I have been to this establishment many times as I live nearby but usually only for drinks. The craft beer selection on tap is great with a rotating special which I enjoyed. Unfortunately when we did try the food three of us ordered the Steak Frites and were very disappointed. Overlooked vegetables and poor quality of the steak which was also overcooked and not med rare. I guess that's why they automatically bring you HP sauce. I decided to try another food item a month later, the Pad Thai and it was also disappointing. No flavour and overcooked noodles. Some friends convinced me to try the brunch with them which turned out to also be a bad decision. I ended up getting mild food poisoning and was sick for the rest of the day. I really hope this place improves their quality of food as I would love to have a great place nearby not only for drinks but for food as well. For now I will be taking my business to Morgans or Sauce."}
{"text":"Having been in the area for about 15 years now I've always been a fan of Sarah's Cafe & Bar. Not a regular but I do like to stop by every so often. Great shaded patio on the side of the location. Hit the patio at about 4:30 for some early dinner and Now Magazine reading. Lots of people taking in the patio today. Great Atmosphere. Also going on was a open mic event inside which happens every Sunday but I didn't take that in today.  I'm partial to ordering my regular Burger and Fries combo with Mozarrella and Mushrooms which is not on their menu and thats what I did today. Wasn''t into drinking today so went with 2 rounds of specialty Jones Root Beer. Root Beer was provided with large mug full of ice. Food and drink tasty as always.  Great service from my regular server who knows my order off by heart. Meal, Drinks, and tip ended up costing me 20 dollars. Not bad."}
{"text":"A group of us came in there the other day, we walked through the restaurant to get to the patio as the sign had said to do, and after we went inside and asked for a server three times, a girl finally came out. (There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant) At this point a couple guys  had already gone inside to get their drinks because they had the same experience last time they were in. The server had such a bad attitude and that's the only reason why I'm writing this review. When we got the bill she brought one over, I find this silly. If I can remember and figure out what everyone had I'm sure she could have, she definitely would have made more in tips if she had put a little bit of effort in. Guinness is cheap, wing and fries were good. Service was brutal.  If we go back hopefully we get a different server, or this one gets a better attitude or we will have to find somewhere else to spend a few hundred dollars."}
{"text":"reserved for a small group, service was dismal, we were not asked if we wanted to order food until we asked after an hour's wait.  The coffee was equally dismal, expresso and water mix - not good.  A unsettling odour drifted from the back regions of the restaurant, where we were seated.  Almost of putrid meat,.  The food, when it arrived was mediocre at best. There are many decent eateries on the Danforth, Sarah's isn't one of them and needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"I've been once, on a weekday evening,and found the service to be slow and disinterested.  Yes, the beer selection is good, but this isn't the 1980's anymore:  there are a million places with a good selction of beers.  The owner's responses to the reviews below and the reviews that were filtered out are quite shocking, and perhaps an indication of why the service was so poor:  The customer is never right, it seems."}
{"text":"I went here today after the restaurant I was planning to go to was closed. Although the food was okay (I had eggs), it was definitely not great and both my friend and I felt sick afterwards. I will not be back and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"i met a local friend there for lunch, this was our 3rd time.  the others were meh? but meeting place was convenient for us,  the daytime waitress is wonderful she gives good service.  i ordered the falafel sandwich on pita with the sauce on side. (im so glad i ordered it on side)  it tasted a bit off in my first few bites and then ignored it.  i got the most violent stomach ache and vomiting and diarrhea for the next 2 days.  it was hell!!    i can't confirm for sure it was from sarahs, but i had dinner the night before at 5pm and then their lunch at 1pm, and that's when it started.  one star for the lovely waitress."}
{"text":"This is our go to local restaurant as our part of the Danforth is sorely lacking in decent restaurants.  However, the last few times we have been there we have been disappointed.   The meat is always over cooked - I've had this with the steak, duck breast, and pork.  It comes out tough and tasteless which is disappointing given the prices you pay.  They have a great beer and wine selection so my go to now is a pint and the fish and chips which are reliably good."}
{"text":"Just ordered salmon cakes and steak frites. Here it is. Oily coleslaw, sauce from the bottle and a strangely thick breaded deep fried oval fish stick.  Greasy, tasteless. And now for the steak frites. The steak is wobbly and grey! We requested med-rare. The fries were greasy soggy and the veg kabob burnt.   Honestly: Come for drinks but forget ordering food for now unless the menu changes radically and turns into exciting, crisp, colorful fare.   Atmosphere is acceptable and prices for beer are fine. But again, with all the options on the Danforth I'd pass on the chow. 3 stars for good effort service. 1 star for lame food...  Edit after owner commentary (see below): My dear, \"why don't you improve your soggy dishes instead of making hopeless wishes?\""}
{"text":"Pleasant enough atmosphere, and excellent beer selection, but they lack sandwich-type options in the $10 range, so against our better judgement we ordered the steak frites. The fries were very good, as were the grilled vegetables, but ours steaks were grey. I ordered mine rare which was properly cooked, but it was literally grey and utterly lacking in flavour. I ended up using HP sauce which is something I shouldn't have to do for a $19 entree.  My message to management? I had avoided your establishment for years because I was certain I would be disappointed. You've got a good thing going on, and if you were to offer simpler dishes at lower costs, I would consider returning. As it stands, I've been left with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"OK beer selection, decent patio, average food and service.  Other yelp reviews here are pretty spot on.  It's one of those places where you don't mind going for a few beers and maybe an app or two, but it's really nothing special aside from the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Damn, I really wanted to love this place as its just a hop, skip & jump from our place.  I was sadly disappointed. Service- There really wasn't any.  Everyone around us got fresh bread bowls while awaiting their dinners, but the waiter missed us.  By the time we finally got a chance to asked he brought out the driest, most crumbly bread...must have been a few days old.  I actually wondered if he did that on purpose and he took so long getting it that our dinner came first.  For a app we ordered a $15 cheese board- um...where was the cheese?  While delicious cheese the Thinnest slices ever and we would have loved to know what the cheeses were that we we eating.  When it came to getting the bill we had to go hunt down the server that left us with empty glasses all night.  We were so disappointed cause we were really looking forward to enjoying Sarah's patio.  The one thing I can say is their beer selection is fabulous!  We will give it one more try it hopes it was just a terrible day...but am I in a rush? Nope."}
{"text":"Thanks for the reply Sheila. However, you state that 'over 500 meals were served' that weekend and no one got sick or complained. How do you know what weekend I went, since I never included this info in my post. Judging from some of the other similar posts I don't think I'm alone in my review. The place has lots of potential but needs to be cleaned up. There is more competition in the area now and you will definitely lose business."}
{"text":"Ouch.  Just came back from here and I guess my 5 star rating was way out of date.  Fish & Chips were probably the worst F&C I've had in 20 years.  French onion soup was really bland and uneventful.  Salmon was great.  Steak and frites came with a grilled veggie kabob that was a nice addition.    I think the trick of this place is to order things that are good for you.  The closer you stick to salads and hummus-like things, the better the place looks."}
{"text":"I can't get past the smell. As soon as you walk in, you were hit by a wave of grease smell... The kind of smell you get when the hoods in the kitchen have not been cleaned for a very long time.  The look and atmosphere of this place has the potential to be great, although it's quite worn down and tired looking at this point. The food is nothing special, in the past three times that I have gone for drinks, my cider or beer has been flat.  Service is blah - every time I'm there I am served by the same person, who doesn't really seem to want to be there and wonders by your table rarely. He has also argued with me in the past that cider is supposed to be flat, but it's nothing wrong with the keg.  I wouldn't bother visiting - there are so many great places on Danforth now, why waste your time with something that is subpar or at best mediocre."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant, on the list of frequent Friday places, staff usually friendly, although in the summer when the patio is open they get a little harried, but then they get a different set of customers then as well..  If you like beer, and by that I mean a wide variety of beer, you'll love this place, and we're not just talking North American micro brews here either, lot's of variety from all over the world...  Oh yeah, the food is good to, including recently it seems the occasional offering of more \"game\" based dishe such as bison or deer..  If you live closer to the lake or are looking for somewhere that is even more about the beer then the food, check out their sister establishment on Queen Street, Castro's Lounge"}
{"text":"The worst brunch I ever had in the East End was at Sarah's. The lettuce was rancid and black and the waitress served us coffee poured over our tea bags instead of water, by mistake, but still.  The only reason I give them a two is that it's an okay place for a beer and dessert. But avoid the other food."}
{"text":"Great mussels. Had the provencal flavour! I was a bit skeptical but this dish was so tasty. Service was amazing.  Friendly waitress and female chef!"}
{"text":"Comfortable spot with friendly service and reasonable food at reasonable prices.  Salad dressing was excellent.  People here were all having good time and knew most people in the room - obviously a favorite for locals."}
{"text":"Once again I choose 3 because there is no 2.5.   Went there on a weekday after work for drinks. Seating area is divided into two. In front there is room for about 20 and then in the back there is another that can probably seat 50. I suppose the back room is also used for parties. There is a large patio on the side with a overhang and relatively smaller one in the front. Would be a nice to sit on a patio on a rainy day. I took a seat inside.  First of all, table was a tad sticky. Big turn off  for me. Service was okay. I am Jack and Ginger man and my drink was fixed just right. They had a huge beer list. Price, the price is right. $32 for three mixed drinks, 1 pint and 2 half pints. I would like to go back and try the food, but it`s a little out of the way for me. But if I do, will be sure to update."}
{"text":"We went here before going out on New Years for dinner. The restaurant was almost empty and we arrived at 8. They were already out of the special by that time which was disappointing as I was looking forward to it. We got the dips to start. The tzatziki was good. The rest were pretty bland. I ordered the steak frites and my friend got the salmon. She made it clear she didn't want the fish overcooked. I ordered the steak medium rare. Her fish was overcooked. My steak on the first attempt was completely raw. Like not rare. Blue raw. The fries were also crunchy raw potato in the centre. The server noticed the steak was raw and took it away to have it re-done. When it came back it was well done, not medium rare. I didn't have time to have them try a third time so I just ate it. The fries were limp the second time but cooked at least and so many were piled on the plate it was impossible to cut into the steak without eating at least half of them. The grilled veggie skewer prominently featured undercooked onions. I've eaten at Sarah's a few times and the food has always ranged from average and edible to delicious. This was a complete disappointment. I don't know if there was a change in kitchen staff but I'll be very hesitant to go back for food. On the upside the server was great. He was really helpful."}
{"text":"A beer snob's delight in the East end.  Food is great. Staff is casual and friendly.  Great for groups or private parties and they have a nice covered patio too!"}
{"text":"From the outside my friends and I were a little hesitant to come here.  However, we were pleased once we did.  There a large menu for breakfast/lunch.  I like how you can create your own burgers - which we all did.  The burger itself was good, but a bit burnt.  Service was very friendly.  I'd come back here when I'm in the neighbourhood but wouldn't travel out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Best patio in the hood, but that's the best thing they have for you.  Inconsistent service and food.  Good beer though, and it's nice inside as well.     A classic example of a place that's been the best the hood can offer for too long.  Complacent."}
{"text":"i love this place. i live in the area and come back regularly for breakfast and lunch. the patio is great and the staff are very polite. there is a big room in the back for larger groups. there's also lots of space for kids and strollers. make sure to try the latkas. keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Seemed pretty good. Just stopped for a light lunch. Would have ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich but they were out of salmon so I just had a bowl of homemade coconut lime soup with chicken. Which was very good. They had good beers on tap, I'd go again to try dinner and sample the beers."}
{"text":"Another great Danforth discovery. If you like tasting new beers and especially micro-brews, this is an amazing place to discover. They have a wide selection of beers from all over the world and a nice terrace on which to savor them! The food is also very nice and served fast enough. The quality/price is satisfying. It's definitely a place I'll be going back to and where I'll bring friends and family."}
{"text":"I first came here with a work colleague when I forgot my lunch at home. Sarah's is a cozy cafe/bar, which also has a great selection in terms of food.  The service is great. Each time I go, I have a different server; however, I have found all the servers to be quite pleasant. The time it takes for food to come to the table is not that long as well. I find that the only downside to the location of the restaurant is the parking. If you do find yourself at Sarah's, have the Pad Thai. It's spicy, but full of chicken and shrimp."}
{"text":"I was committed to 3 stars until I saw the bathroom, which definitely had the distinct odour and wet floor of a dive bar. Not a happy place. I shared a simple cheese plate and decent cappuccinos on a Wednesday evening. The patio looks cozy but it was a bit chilly for sitting outside. Waitstaff service was attentive, friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"Have passed by Sarah's on a number of occassions and it always seems full of people (usually a good sign). Was in the area so decided to give it a try. Glad i did.  Service: Other older reviews knock the service, but on the night I was there the Service was spot on...friendly, efficient and attentive (water was kept filled, checked to see that our meals were to our liking etc.) i would give the service 5 stars...i guess they got rid of the bad wait staff mentioned in older reviews.  Ambiance: quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Nice earth tones on the wall, candles and good music (not too loud either...you can actually have a conversation)  Food/drink: 4 stars. Started out with the mesculin salad which was crispy, fresh and well dressed with a homemade vinagrette. I ordered the salmon filet with veg., wilted spinach and potato latke.  everything was cooked to order and excellent. Veggies were tender crisp, salmon was done to perfection and latke was hot and crispy.   My wife had the lamb chops with lentils and veg. Again, the veg were tender, not soggy, the lentils were perfectly al dente and the lamb was tender and juicy.    The cost for the entrees were $20-$22 and the portion sizes were quite Large. Good value for the money. Also liked the extensive wine list and large selection of craft beers.   Overall: this is a good local, casual bistro with efficient service and good, well prepared food. Would i drive across Toronto to go here? Probably not, but if you are in the area its worth a try  Return: definitely, when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"I am not the type to write negative reviews; however I felt compelled to do so with this place. It really opened my eyes about how important customer service is in a restaurant and how it can ruin the moment for people who are looking to enjoy their day.  I finished my shift and my bf and I decided we should enjoy the remainder of the day. We were appealed to this cafe because of its patio. As soon as I saw the waitress she looked super stressed out and I immediately got bad vibes but sat down anyway.  My boyfriend was going to order a beer and I wanted an iced coffee because im allergic to alcohol. When he asked her for the iced coffee our waitress said \"no no I'm not going to make you that, there is a starbucks right across the street\".   At this point I'm looking at my bf with a wtf expression on my face. He orders a beer just so she could leave but then asks if we were going to order food. We weren't planning on it since we are both vegans and there was wasn't much options for us but we ordered fries to go with his beer. I told her my reasoning and she walked off saying \"beer doesn't have meat in it\" in the most rudest tone.   For the rest of the time we were there we ate the fries and drank the beer as fast as we could to get the hell out of there. Most awkward experience of my life and this is coming from someone who has worked 9 years of customer service. I felt like I was on the \"what would you do\" show. Some people should just not be working with customers."}
{"text":"This place was literally just ok.  I ordered a mimosa to kick-start my morning and appreciated that the OJ and the bubbly was delivered separately so I could mix my own (and yes I was tempted to forgo the OJ all together and suck down my small bottle of booze... but I am a lady so I added the OJ... for colour!)  My friend's coffee was served to him with a giant dose of curdled cream!  The food was ok but not really impressive. The smoked salmon and onion concoction was ok but over priced.  To be honest I probably wouldn't eat here again but as a cafe or bar it's not bad."}
{"text":"I have been here over the years and have noticed that it is not the same as it used to be. It is kind of the local watering hole because my friends live close to it and it is convenient. The food has underwhelmed me as of late and I wish I had gotten a little more for the price. There aren't really any dishes that stand out for me either. It is not the worst place but the cooks have changed over the years and it is just there now. I am glad to see that some are giving it good reviews and hopefully Sarah's will find it's old charm back.  Now having said this, if you have a group of people, their finger food platters are pretty good.  Basic and greasy but good - nachos, chicken fingers, spring rolls etc."}
{"text":"Worst service eeeeeever. Don't go there. I can't recommend this place. I couldn't even eat because the waiters were so unfriendly. I had to go to other place on danforth to have dinner."}
{"text":"If you dont mind smelling like a french fry fryer when you leave the food here is good enough but the ventilation in this small restaurant with an open kitchen concept is neglect. Try the summer and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little pub/cafe on a part of the Danforth without many options for restaurants. Sarah's has a nice patio for the warmer months and the decor inside gives it a bit of a retro feel.  The menu is as diverse as the wall coverings - part pub, part Asian, part bistro - all awesome! The daily specials are always tasty and the regular menu is just as good.  There are no pretentious attitudes there (at least I have never experience them). I am a big fan.  If you are looking for something a little off the Danforth-Greektown beatin' path, Sarah's is a good choice!"}
