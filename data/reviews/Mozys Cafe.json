{"text":"A little hole in the wall type donair, shawarma, mediterranean food place.  I've eaten here 4 times I think.  The owner is friendly and happy to make suggestions.    I like the chicken shawarma best so far, but have tried the donair and rice plate too which were both very good too.  It makes me happy to see a good small business that is successful.  It's very small and the seating area isn't that big.  If you like a nice donair or shawarma this is a place to try."}
