{"text":"1. Employees are often rude and unprofessional when greeted at POS stations, they will often not respond to \"how are you?\" and will often just blankly stare at you. 
2. While all Barrett Honors Dining Hall Aramark employees are professional acting and fluent English speakers, whereas other dining halls this is not the case for the employees? The language barrier is a health and safety concern as allergens cannot be properly conveyed when requested.
3. Employees working at food stations tend to stand in back of station, acting busy and avoiding eye contact with guests, to avoid having to retrieve their food. This is especially prominent at the grill stations. They act as though they are immune from any employer discipline for wrongdoing.
4. Employees scuff when asked for an entre at a food station. Often will not say anything after being told \"thank you\" and will toss plate at you under sneeze guard while staring at you.
5. Guests often do not of options at food stations such as tomatoes or lettuce on hamburgers, because they are not clearly displayed on glass and employees often close lids to obstruct view of those items.
6. Employees are often not in correct uniforms, sometimes wearing MLB caps. I have seen POD workers, and other Aramark employees not wearing identifying name badges.
7. I witnessed a POD employee drop a sleeve of unwrapped ICEE cups on ground and then proceed to refill the cup dispenser with those contaminated cups.
8. I have received dirty, coated beverage cups from the \"clean\" cup racks, this is a health and safety concern and is often a warning sign that dishes are not being properly sanitized.
9. The soda fountains do not have ice machines for some reason and on a daily bias run out of ice, and sometime are just completely out of operation. Nearly every day I need to select my third or fourth choice of drink simply because only water comes out, meaning the BIB (bag in box) needs to be changed.
10. There are often no utensils necessary to eat a meal available to guests, they are only put out in limited batches and I have been dining where there wasn't a single one for in the entire dining establishment. There are no utensils at grill station.
11. Menus posted to sneeze guards often contain unavailable or had never been available items.
12. Sun Devil Dining and Aramark seem to cater to the \"vegan\" crowd, while removing food options for other guests, most likely because transitioning to this type of food is cheaper than serving traditional food, but at the same costs to all guests? 
13. The single limited condiment station is out of sauces on an hourly basis, I once notified an employee there was no condiments to which she assured me \"Yes, yes, I get someone\". After waiting for 10 minutes no employee had come to correct the issue.
14. Employees often seem to be sent on break during key operational periods (lunch/dinner \"rush\") and will be seen lounging around on cell phones while stations will often form extremely long lines.
15.  Consistently there are several employees on \"cleaning duty\" simply wiping down tables when long lines at food stations, but somehow the dining hall is consistently in unclean condition.
16. Guests often complete the surveys asking what they would like to see improved but Sun Devil Dining / Aramark have not acted on a single one of these suggestions.
Overall, the dining experience with Sun Devil Dining / Aramark has been the worst ever seen on any university or institution campus, and it seems to stem from the employee/company culture of \"we have your money, what are you going to do about it?\" 
Immediate change is needed or will result in sharing of these findings to prospective students, and if deemed necessary local and state health and safety organizations.
DEMAND CHANGE FROM ASU. STOP GETTING RIPPED OFF."}
{"text":"Sun Devil Dining on Lemon Street has probably been the worst dining experience I have ever had. Day after day, they run out of pretty much everything half way through the day, including probably the most popular item, grilled chicken. They don't even care to have the food prepared by 11am, which is the time they tell everyone the main food options will be available by. Along with many other students, I am sick and tired of shitty food and horrible service by the workers. Except for Ashley, she has always been happy and smiling. Everything about this dining hall has been awful and if there were a way for me to take my money back, and put that towards something else, preferably food that is edible, I would greatly appreciate it. Hopefully this will reach the eyes of someone in charge so they can change these ways and start making students happy. But until then, Keep up the shitty service."}
{"text":"I highly recommend going to the Aramark office on campus and signing up for M&G dollars. This is a service that they provide to students and it's a really great deal.

M&G dollars work like a debit card when you spend money for food on campus. It makes it easier than carrying cash around. If you lose it they can freeze the account until you find it, so no one else can spend your money! And they don't expire so long as you use it more than once every six months. 

So why should you sign up you ask? Well depending on how much you spend you get bonus dollars (breakdown below) and if you pay with M&G dollars at a food vendor you are not charged for sales tax. So if you are going to be spending money on food on campus...do yourself a favor and save some money!"}
